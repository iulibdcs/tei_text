"ABOVE me are the Alps, The palaces of Nature, whose vast walls Have pinnacled in clouds their snowy scalps, And throned eternity in icy halls Of cold sublimity--" THOSE icy halls are glittering now in crimson and molten gold. The eternal sun has withdrawn to his rest behind those palace-walls, and the gorgeous dra- peries of his triumphal march through the heavens, yet hang voluminous from the mountain-tops, tossing and swayv piing  win  ds, and faring reflected glory down upon the lake, which stretches broad and clear  beneath the village of Lowerz. Precipices shelve with rocky descent to the water, now so tranquil in the early summer twilight that it is well-nigh impossible to recognize in it the, slumbering power which, aroused, has overwhelmed in fury these shores and the fairy island resting with gray fortress-ruin on its bosom. From the northward, across fromthe village, foams the lake's chief tributary down from the mountain heights, how flashing, rainbow-like, in the sunset, now gleaming faintly in some mossy hollow. Here at the  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7551-00000004"/> 6         INrowTMTsCO. village the green shores slope gradually down, and farther, bowers of the vine, not yet in full purple pomp, dash with shade the peaceful fields of wheat and rye. East, west, and north across the lake, rise mountains densely wooded with beech and oak, and here and there a crest of pines upon a loftier summit-rugged cliffs and fearful steeps softened by pasture-alps of rich, deep verdure. The village itself quaint and olden-timed, is picturesque enough. The white chapel and its glittering cross upon the hille "God's Acre,' blossoming for the Resurrection around; down in yonder glen the gray monastery hid amid the trees, save the one heavy square tower from which solemnly swells the vesper bell; and here the rows of pink and green and many-tinted cottages in midst of gardens and snow-drift orchards. Foremost in conscious supe- riority stands the inn, in all the glories of vine-sha- dowed balconies, overhanging walnut gables, and allur- ing arbors inviting the wayfarer to the refreshing bowl of coffee, or, as appears by that group of jovial village autocrats, to the foaming tankard and the pipe of good- fellowship. But few would have staid to give a more than passing glance to village, lake, or mountain beauty, while Margaret Ross. stood leaning there upon the gate. Her closely-fitting dark cloth riding-habit con- cealed not a curve of the graceful figure, not too slight for her stature, which was rather above the average height of woman. She had doffed her black-plumed hat, and masses of wavy dark-brown hair flowhig in the light as though a lost golden-red ray of sunset lingered there, drooped, loosened by her late ride and the evening breeze, low upon the slender throat. A strangely attractive face-one that, glanced at for an   1           OcnwGmsco. 1 instant in passing, days afterward would haunt your memory like the rhythm of a long-ago forgotten poem, or like the half-dreamed childish day-dream which was wont to flit before your drowsy eyes on a sunny May noontide, as you lay--forgetting the dreaded tinkle of the distant school-bell in the nearer tinkle of the bees--beneath the white elder-boughs at the edge of the brook, in that shadowy dingle we all know so well. . That dreamy gaze-the melancholy mouth -the low broad brow--bore no slight resemblance to the mournful loveliness of the poet's Evangeline. Yet as she turned again to the gentleman at her side, a smile like sunlight flashing from her eyes, it needed not the clear blue of those eyes, the dazzling fairness of the brow, the faint blush-rose of the cheek, to dis- tinguish the Scottish girl from the maid of Acadia. "You sigh, Margaret," he had said with a wistful glance in the bright blue eyes fixed upon her the while she had stood rapt in reverie, her gaze afar- he bowing his fair young noble head, among the clus- tering curls of which one looked for the helmet's im- print. So did the innate knightly spirit stamped on handsome glowing face and lithe and hardy figure, revert from the carpet-knights of modern chivalry to the golden days of eld, when the worshiped gold *was a ladye's sunny tress--ere yet the i Almighty Dollar " had usurped the throne. "Did I sigh?" she returned softly. "It must be that looking up here, where ' Nature's heart Beats strong among her hills,' one feels a pulsation of those lofty heart-throbs-an aspiration--a vague yearning   after far heights to &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7551-00000005"/> 8         ' INGMSCO. which few of us are strong to attain-mountain-tops of the soul, whence those who dare gain them, look down upon the clouds that lie along yonder low hori- zon 1"And she pointed to a dark drift bearing heavily down through a gap in the mountains, while on the heights above, the sunset glory rested yet. Her companion kept an instant's moody silence, and when reply he did, it was with some bitterness: "I was rash enough to dream for a moment that a sigh so wistful and a gaze so absent must be in me- moriam of far Scotland; forgetting how transient is the in memoriam of old scenes, old friends, old feel- ings, in a young lady's heart." She turned and flashed on him one glance of indig- nant surprise, then averted her head without a word. "Margaret, forgive me," he cried with quick regret. "If you knew the torment of fear of change in the loved one, you could not be angry. Old times are swept away in all this hurry of travel and new scenes. I seem to be losing my hold on you--so many come between and jostle us apart. Would to God we had never left our own old Highlands. They were high as our childish aspirations ever soared together, and there at least nothing might part us. Will it be so. ever again?"  She smiled at his passionate words, and laid her hand upon his arm with a caressing gesture, as she said: "Harry, a few months can not sweep away all those years. Dearer than ever are they all-those old famil- iar haunts, this old familiar-shall I say friend, who has so little faith in me?  But look-only look at Alice!" she added, her smile deepening as Harry fol- lowed the direction of her glance. "No, not there;   I                aXICmalsco.        9 at the round table beneath that great maple. See how she is gossiping with that buxom matron and the rosy-cheeked girl, a truant shepherdess of Watteau's, I am sure. And with what an air. of complacency that queer old fellow-is he not Pickwick in sky-blue shorts?-rubs his plump hands together, listening. The witch! I am afraid she's no canny, for beyond a doubt she has thrown a glamour over that entire group. Alas for the ' Mutter-sprache!'-her German is most abominable jargon. Do you remember how she'would torment poor old Herr Grimm, declaring Nature never intended that a douce Scottish lassie who could take no flights, should go beyond wie geht's, else the road to learning would have no barriers, wee gates or any others. See, she is beckoning to us. Let us go--that grimace betokens merriment on foot." The younger sister, that fairy "lassie wi' the lint- white locks" falling in a perfect shower of short curls half vailing the merry blue eyes, held out in one rosy dimpled hand-as she leaned her round pink chin in the palm of the other, her elbow resting on " the round table beneath the great maple"-a great bun from the plate the matron was pressing hospitably upon her. And she continued nod and beck until, the new-comers drawing near, she bent forward, still looking at Harry, and said something in, an undertone which deepened the red in the apple cheek of the shepherdess. "What the devil is the girl about now?" was Har- ry's nervous mental questioning. For dire experience through fifteen years of wardship under Mr. Ross's roof had made him wary of that twinkle in the merry maiden's eye. Angels might have seemed more closely concerned in her plot, if plot there were, for never was man pres4    &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7551-00000006"/> 10         GIGEMSCO. ently more ministered unto, than this Harry May was now. The father's huge meerschaum, though unac- cepted, quite at his service-the fragrant coffee prof- fered at the mother's hands-the daughter rapt atten- tion when he' spoke, and eyes and mouth rounded to the " ei, ei " comment when he paused. Evidently he waxed restive under this ordeal, and at last was on the eve of beating a retreat, when Alice, quickly divining his intention, tossed him the skeini of yarn which she was winding for their hos- tess, begging him just to undo for her that one ob- stinate knot, which really had exhausted her perse- verance. No sooner had she thus entangled him, than up she sprang, twining her arm within her sister's and draw- ing her away, while with a nod and a smile to Harry, she dared him in English to enact the Alexander. Harry rose as if to follow, but the good dame inter- posed with a timely question, and he remained, lean- ing against the giant trunk of the over-spreading ma- ple, impatiently polite. Gordian knot was but a mere loop to his entanglement. Interrogation, exclama- tion, labyrinths of description, invectives upon these mountains where rocks are the crops most plentiful- besides, they shut out the view so! Thus the traveled Netherland burgomaster. "How much longer will Harry's patience or polite- ness stand that test? He allows people to do what  they will with him, though he has spirit, too," Mar- garet exclaimed in an irritated tone as she and Alice, arm in arm, went slowly down the garden-walk in the faint moonlight.

" counterparts?" and Alice looked up with a mischiev- ous smile into her sister's face. "What have you been scheming against him? For scheming you have been, that is evident," the other said, waiving the question. Alice laughed merrily. "Revenge! revenge!" she answered. "You know, or probably you don't, how Harry took me to task this morning for having, as he terms it, blazoned abroad your engagement while at Unterseen. I told you, you remember, of my inadvertent admission of it. But Harry attacked me in such force that in the confusion I could rally not even a single lame apology, and-----" "So! Harry is tenacious of the secret!"Margaret interrupted, flushing. "Nonsense, Madge. So far as he is concerned, he would have it proclaimed from the mountain-tops as a warning to all aspiring fellow-travelers that this J-ing Frau is inaccessible as her icy mountain sister. But to my revenge. I told him how my Unterseen inter- locutrice had numbered him foremost in my train, and asked if I should have left her in that belief. He re- plied, curtly enough, that my name was my own, but that he would not have you annoyed by the public joining of yours with his. Therefore, as my name is my own, and he professes indifference as to his, Ma- dame Rumor shall report that he and I are the pro- messi sposi. The slight hint I have given yonder worthy party, will be quite sufficient for the purpose. Madame Rumor will vouch for it on authority of in- timate friends-of the young lady. Baron Starnberg is here, and he will most assuredly take the hint, and transfer his devoirs from poor little me to 'one ver' &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7551-00000007"/> 12        INTMrSCO. handsome Fraulein, of one ver' noble--what you call atmosphere.' You recollect that unique compliment, and Harry's uneasiness thereat. Indeed, it was that which suggested my scheme, as you call it, on hearing the Baron's name among the titled alphabet of guests the dame rehearsed for my benefit before I called you." "Alice! .shall I quote compliment against compli- ment? You very well know that atmosphere was not by half so congenial as certain airs and graces familiar to your fairyship. But where is the Baron, that we have not seen him?" "Off on some hunting expedition for the day, I be- lieve. . There is quite a party staying here-a German baroness and her brother, an English visitor, and I don't know who beside. I do hope the carriage won't be repaired for two or three days. Lowerz and fun forever!" "Are you not hasty, Alice?  Your baroness may be fat, her brother smoky, the English milor from Paddington, and  the 'who beside' not so very fas- cinating as to make you oblivious of Luzerne and Ba- den in the distance. But your mystery? there is some. thing yet unexplained. Why were Herr B-argermeis- ter and comely Frau so marked in their attentions to Harry? and what did you say to make the comely maiden blush so intensely?" "Oh! a few innuendoes," laughed Alice, 4for which the famous young gentleman owes a debt of gratitude.

Did you really so much dislike that report of your engagement?" Margaret did not reply. - She was watching a skiff freighted with two gentlemen and a lady, which was making for the bank directly before her. "Look, Alice, who can that be? Is he not like our  " "Exile of Erin! It is he or his wraith! My beat- ing heart, be still!"Alice cried, ecstatically clasping her hands. The boat gained the shore, and its passengers disem- barked-two gentlemen and a lady, dark and bright, very French, very piquant. She came slowly up the bank, two tiny well-gloved hands folded over the,arm of her fair-haired companion, chatting gayly with both in a breath. The girls at the gate started forward with an ex- clamation of surprise, and at the same instant. she looked up. There was a simultaneous rush, a perfect overwhelming of hastily reiterated embraces, and de- lighted murmurs of "Mignonne, quel plaisir! la bien- venue!" "What freak of fortune has whirled so far into these forests two such votaries of Paris as the Baroness Waldien and Mr. More?  We looked upon you as the city boulevards," Margaret said, as she shook hands cordially with the taller and darker of the men. "So, I fancy, did Paris," he replied.  "But I thought it as well to give it a lesson in self-reliance; so one morning I and my friend here-permit me to introduce Count Falkenstein, Baroness Waldien's brother. Baroness, had you any special reason for leaving him like a naughty boy in the background? Well, Falkenstein and I found ourselves at Rome, and  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7551-00000008"/> "        INGEMSCO.  soon thereafter the boulevards of the Baroness, Baron Waldien being summoned to Paris by the illness of a friend. 'Tis an ill wind that blows nobody good, Miss Alice-may I hope you do not so consider that which has just wafted us across from Isle Schaanau?" "The landlady won't, at all events!" she mocked. "And did the same wind transport you from Rome?" "I yield to none," he returned, "my claim upon the brilliant idea of spending a few weeks in the ' Forest Cantons before meeting the Baron at Baden. Need I add that the idea and the knowledge, through the Baroness, of your destination, were simultaneous?" "Ma foi!" cried the Baroness, lifting her hands. "When Max he tell two three times it must him see my belle Anglaise! He in despair when I draw her picture--he go the end of the world for her to meet. And, desiree," she whispered, laying a light touch on Margaret's arm. "You will like him well, let him be your Schatz-he come the long of this voyage to see you, express." Margaret blushed and wished her friend less enthu- siastic, for she met the eyes of her destined Schatz fixed upon her, and began to fear he had heard the whisper. She turned, saying: "And what are you going to. do with yourself in the wildwood, Mr. More?" "Did you ever read Peter Schlemyl, Miss Ross? Well, I am going to be a more merciful shadow. But if you weary of me beforehand, only say you desire no More agreeable society, and I decamp, leaving you in Peter's wofully shadowless plight, and the Count here to play twilight after the gorgeous sunshine in which I appear."  "Beware!"Margaret warned. "Are there no fem-   IXTGEMNISCO.        15 jnine Oliver Twists, the burden of whose cry shall be ever 'More, More'?" "C'est cela meme," put in the Baroness.

More that-and the pretty young girls looking comme ga!" And she swept round, flirting her fan and looking over her shoulder at him with so coquettish an air of petite mattresse, that a general laugh followed. "Oh!" cried Margaret, after an instant's pause, "I have not all this time heard of my especial friend the Baron. Mamma and I were talking of him only this morning.  You know he is as great a favorite with her as with -me. I hope he has not forgotten me. I often think of our many pleasant walks and talks in Rome, and how he enlightened my ignorance on more than one occasion. Scolding and ridiculing as little as a guide-book, and ten thousand times more enter- taining." "And he, he calls you his ne plus ultra, always.

Come," she ended, nodding to him and following her sister, who in different terms had extended the same invita- tion to the Baroness and Count Falkenstein. "Alice," whispered Margaret, as she stood aside a moment, avoiding the flower-border and yielding the path to some passers-by, "are you going to com- plete the capture of our British Lion? Did you ever see such a curiosity? An accurate portrait-painter, too. The 'personable young fellow' will prove an acquisition to our party, I prophesy, although as yet he has only made a bow." -   I r  ns "SITThrH the fair ladye Close to the river side, Which runneth on with a merry tone, fier merry thoughts to guide.

Yet if the one give too much strain upon it, out she drops, and leaves nor space nor trace." The Count's handsome mouth was expressive of much silent contempt, which even the "bewitching fair moustache " could not entirely conceal. Another turn was taken in silence, during which Margaret rose in her second attempt to effect an escape unseen. But the Count stopped directly before her retreat, and she could only shrink back behind the leafy screen, having already involuntarily played the eavesdropper too long to risk being caught in the act. "It is said," Falkenstein began abruptly, "that she is a Braut-fiangee-betrothed, you call it? Is that true? You have known her long-many months; tell me if it be so?" More smiled. "We are not so frank in these affairs as you," he said, " and I can add very little to your own informa- tion. You mean, of course, young May. How did you hear this?^ "Indirectly through a friend of hers."  Margaret smiled as she remembered Alice's prediction concern- ,       , '   &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7551-00000011"/> 240       . moWtSco. ing Madame Rumor, but looked annoyed as Falken- stein muttered with a heavy sigh: "Well that I have not made an egregious fool of myself." "Nay, man, never lose heart for that," exclaimed More kindly, clapping him on the shoulder. "Love is 'the paradise of fools, to few unknown.' And for your comfort in it, our betrothals, let me tell you, are not like yours. They don't tie one up so confound- edly tight, and this one may prove a slip-knot after all : Besides, who knows that it is not the other sis- ter? Of the two, she would seem more congenial to May. A fine young fellow, yet I am mistaken if he do not find the matrimonial noose of your lady fair the very strongest of leading-strings. For my part, I can only account for-the state of his and your optics with regard to the two sisters on the hypothe- sis of purblindness."  The last two sentences were lost upon Margaret as the speakers passed on finally beyond the cliff. So, more fortunate than eavesdroppers in general, with a smile upon her lips, and a feeling that Mr. More's suggestion as to the betrothed sister had set all right, she clambered -up from her rock-bound niche and strolled on toward the cottage. Some surprise she felt when Falkenstein thus de- clared himself, for his attentions to her had been some- what marked. But then, Alice had been so engrossed by Mr. More and several other gentlemen temporali- ly joining the Ross party. And too, this morning, to which Falkenstein had alluded, she remembered how Alice had shown him a very observable though thoughtless slight, and had waived his invitation to   INGEMSCO.         21 ride in favor of a scarcely formed engagement with Baron Stamberg. She remembered how Falkenstein had stood in no very amiable mood upon the balcony as they all swept past the inn. But she forgot that, she having formed herself an engagement with Mr. More the evening before, the gloomy brow and dis- tant bow might be differently accounted for. Conjecture strengthened. into firm belief when, as she returned to the cottage and found its little world assembled in -the coffee-arbor, she saw Falkenstein at Alice's side, and observed his attentions. When at last he came and stood. beside her own chair, or walked restlessly up and down, she attributed his deportment to a very laudable but highly unsuccess- ful attempt to carry out his friend More's advice, "Ah I there she is. Just in time, Madge," cried Alice, making room for her sister as she paused in the doorway. "Tenez," handing her a cup of coffee when she had taken her seat; " and you, cavilers," she added, glancing round as she detected an aside of her father's to Harry May, " don't accuse me of brib- ery; this is a reward; for I know Margaret is already on our side against the opposition- meaning you two and mnamma.  What do you think, Margaret-papa and Harry want, or pretend to want, to leave Lowerz to-morrow!" "Why, papa!" and Margaret turned :in dismay to the stalwart, handsome man at her side, to whom she bore a resemblance so striking that Alice declared it exceedingly unmaidenly in her not to blush when strangers called him handsome. Her face caught the reflection of his smile, and she said gayly:  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7551-00000012"/> 22         INGWMTSCO. "Well, if go we must, I hope you have faith to re- move mountains; for we can not think of leaving be- hind the range in Zug if you can stow them away in the carriage-box with the Echo Cave. Andto fill up the ravines, pray squeeze in thy Egeri See, if you can keep it ' right side up with care.' And for you, Harry, would you beat an ignominious retreat, not having killed a single chamois, while Count Falkenstein has won a beard? And you a Highland hunter too!" Harry colored, but made no reply. It was evident that he at least had received the suggestion made in jest with earnest pleasure. "What says mamma?"Margaret asked now, look- ing somewhat anxiously across the table. The fair, fragile mamma shook her head, with an arch glance toward Alice, who, really worried, sat pouting half in jest, half earnest. "Nobody will listen to me," she said, raising her head, laughing, but serious withal; L' and yet mine is a most cogent plea for delay. What is a chamois more or less to the ignominy of losing a bear-hunt, and a polar bear at that? You all remember the Polish Count, whom we meet so often in our rambles? Well, Harry and I have a wager depending upon my powers of fascination. Harry declares he invariably glances at Margaret when he bestows that graceful bow in passing. But I know better. The idea! Why, the man has magnificent eyes--I never saw keener!' "Fairly conquered, Mistress Alice. We remain your willing prisoners," her father said, amid the gen- eral laughter. X "Beseeching Mademoiselle to keep us attached to   INGEMSCO.         23 her own triumphal car," Falkenstein said, gallantly bowing. "' For oh! if there be an Elysium on earth, It is this, it is this---"' chimed in Mr. More. Baron Starnberg seemed not only quite as much at- tached as Falkenstein to Alice's triumphal car, but quite willing to bow his head beneath any yoke which she might deign to impose. And the lively Baroness clapped her hands in ecstacy over the victory. "But," began Margaret, as that discussion gave place presently to the discussion of English sand- wiches, tea and coffee-" are we doomed to close con- finement to this seventh heaven? May we make no excursions, to-morrow, for instance?" "As you will," laughed Alice, " always provided no one poaches on my hunting-grounds. Do you know all Lowerz says our mysterious Count is in league with his Satanic majesty? That, of course, explains why he lives in solitude and gloom. And that is why strange lights glimmer all the dreary midnight from his ruined castle.

Margaret smiled, the Baroness started up with a cry just parting her lips, but catching Margaret's eye reseated herself and archly joined in rallying Alice  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7551-00000013"/> 24          rG;NGMTSCO. upon the ghost she had raised. Then Mrs. Ross said gravely: "But, my dear child, bear-hunting is not the safest of amusements nor the most appropriate to adventur- ous damsels. I trust you will not be so insane as to carry your joke too far." "Yesterday, when Harry and I met him on the Schwyz road, I was on the eve of carrying it only so far as to fall from my horse--poor innocent sheep- for his especial benefit. But so slight was the glance he bestowed upon me that I would probably have been doomed to the mortification of being picked up by only Harry; besides convicting myself of horse- womanship so wretched as to lose all hope of ever mounting that magnificent black steed of his, which, by the by, my shocked rnamma, is literally my wa- ger." "Where is your lion's den?" asked Mr. More. "On the Egeri See, there has he long dwelt. If to- morrow we form one little expedition to the Echo -Cave, so may Mademoiselle Elsa have another- bow, perhaps"-the Baroness said in her idiomatic broken English. "Admirable!" cried Margaret--" a large party and a long day. Set forth with the sun, and ride home with the moon. It will be so clear and beautiful," she added, looking up through the boughs at the cloudless starry sky. The plan pleased all, and all entered into consulta- tions as to whom should be invited, naming over among the travelers, of whom just then there was a goodly number at Lowerz, a list of those titled by birth or agreeability.            v   I TOGRMGTSCO*       25 "Stay, sixteen," counted Mrs. Ross--" will Dame ?t   Echo have space to entertain more?" "Oh! yes," replied Margaret, who had ere now been one of that dame's visitors; " but do you not think, Baroness, that we have enough?   We have named over all our especial friends, I think." The Baroness declared any addition to this sum of perfections would ruin all; the Baron in an im- pressive aside murmured something to Alice, of which the words audible were "only one--too many, by far too many, if you do not promise before to ride with me." While Alice laughed and blushed and gave the promise, Falkenstein pushed back his chair, and stood in moody silence at the entrance, until after a time Margaret rose and exclaiming against the inhospitable reception of the breeze struggling in vain to find a way through the clustering vines, strolled out to the gate, and thence, as Falkenstein joined her, and Alice and the Baroness followed with the Baron and Mr. More, wandered slowly along the shore, listening chiefly to "The water lapping on the crag, And the long ripple washing in the reeds;" for her companion spoke little.- And tired pres- ently with trying to interest him in the next day's expedition, the delightful evening, or the delightful Countess, she took her seat upon the gnarled root of a giant oak at the very water's edge, determined to leave him to the enjoyment of his moodiness. Then was heard the plash of oars, and in the bright line. of light thrown by the moon across the lake, glid- ed a tiny skiff from which, as the rowers now rested  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7551-00000014"/> 20         NGEMrSCO. on their oars swaying to and fro on the waves length- ening in the freshened breeze, floated Alice's bird-like notes, with the Baroness's louder tones-the Baron's full deep base in rich accord. Margaret took up the chorus, and after a moment Falkenstein chimed in. "Count Falkenstein!"Margaret exclaimed in sur- prise. "What a shame to have deprived us of your voice all this while, when it is so far better than the other gentlemen's, except " She stopped, blushing, remembering that her ex- ception was not quite in accordance with rules of po- liteness. "Go on," he said, with some wounded vanity. "No. You think me rude, and that is far from my design. If you were not so very unmanageable," she added, smiling, "I would say, as I was about to do, that I would much rather sing with you, your voice accords with mine so much better than Baron Stamrberg's." His eyes brightened, and he stopped in his walk, throwing himself on the bank at her feet. "Sing, then," he said. After an instant's pause she began. But when she had sung a few bars ,and found him still silent, she stopped short. "I have not the faintest intention of singing alone," she said, looking down upon him questioningly. "An execrable song," he muttered, absorbed the while in twisting and untwisting a branch of clema- tis which she had broken off and let fall absently. "What,' La donna e mobile!' Your taste is parallel with your mode of expressing it. For myself, I think   INGMTsco.          27 it-beautiful, and so true.

He suddenly crumpled the starry blossoms in his hand, and threw them from him with no little energy. She, watching the returning boat, did not observe this, but rose as he resumed his restless walk, and proposed to rejoin the voyagers. "The stupid fellow!" she commented, as they moved on together; then relenting, '"But that naughty sister of mine is indeed enough to drive one dis- tracted.". ^j  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7551-00000015"/> m.

THE early beams of sunrise were streaming upon Lake. Lowerz, but scarce brighter than Margaret's face, as, equipped for her ride, she left her room to join the party already assembling on the balcony. "My mother awake, Alison?" she asked of her mother's maid, a staid, elderly personage who was passing as she paused on the threshold, drawing on her gloves. "No, Miss, not yet." "What is the matter?    Do you want any thing?" Margaret asked, observing that the woman hesitated, with a perplexed expression of countenance. "Well, yes, Miss Margaret, only I dinna like to fash ye wi' it now. But my leddy's drops are just clean gane, and there isna a bit o' arrowroot in the house, forbye ither things she'll hae need o' the morn.

Give it to me. This is all, is it? But, Alison, you should not have left it to the last moment," Margaret said rather impatiently. "Miss, Margaret forgets Hans hasna been at hame ae day this week" "Ah! true. It is my own fault. I should have thought of that Now please don't mention it to my mother, and you shall have every thing as soon as possible. Luise"-to a peasant girl who at that moment made her appearance-" can you guide us to Zug? Do you know the way up the mountain to the Echo Cave?" '"Ach no, mein Fraulein. You remember I have always lived in Glarus until now, and I don't know these mountains.5  "Then could you go in to Schwyz to make some purchases for me?" "I was never in Schwyz but once, gracious Frau- lein. I should lose myself in those great clattering streets." - Margaret smiled at the " great clattering streets" of Schwyz, and at the frightened look which accompanied the words. "Then you*shall not go alone. You will' not be afraid of the great streets with me? Away, then, to' the inn, for a pony, and let me see you at the gate in five minutes." Luise hastened upon her errand, and Margaret walked with slower step into the balcony. It was a greater disappointment than she chose to acknow- ledge to herself, this giving up of her long-planned excursion. For although she had once before taken  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7551-00000016"/> 30         INGMSCO. the same ride, yet it was during the absence of Mr. Ross and Harry May upon a hunting-party, and she had quite looked forward to introducing them to the haunt of the echoes. Still, her brow was unclouded when Harry lifted her into the saddle, and she cantered on between him and Count Falkenstein, chatting gayly, until after two or three miles was reached the junction of two roads, the one turning northward to Zug, the other branching off in almost the opposite direction toward the littte city of Schwyz. Here Margaret checked her horse, beckoning at the same moment to Luise, who rode behind with Hans. "What is the matter, Margaret? Both your guides inefficient?" called Alice on observing her pause. "Luise and I are upon a private expedition of our own. We are not of your party this morning. We go to Schwyz." "Madge, this will never do," exclaimed her father, riding up. "'We can not at all do without you. What is it you want in Schwyz? Some nonsensical shopping, I'll warrant." Then as she shook her head, smiling, he said, "Well, if it is important, send Hans. Or stay, he is our guide. Give me your commission." "Let me go, Miss Ross," offered the Count. "Or me," echoed Harry. "Yes, you indeed!" she mocked, shaking her whip at him, "A pretty bungle you would make, truly, of laces and ribbons! No, indeed! lI prefer to manage my own affairs, and you will all repair forthwith to Zug." "H1ow provoking!" cried Alice. And regrets and expostulations were showered upon the deserter by   INGEMSCO.         31 the sixteen friends en mase.

"No, no"--then in a lower tone--"I am really obliged to go, for my mother; but the party must not lose another. Now go, there's a good :Harry, for my father's sake." "For your sake, Margaret?" "Well, well-only go!" she replied, turning her horse's head. "Methinks, May," Falkenstein observed, laying his hand upon her bridle, "that we would have but little difficulty in carrying away this hard-hearted' young lady bodily." "At your peril attempt it," Margaret answered in merry defiance. "My faithful Glamis has not borne me through so many dangers by flood and field, to be daunted now by a pair of recreant knights. And now, to end this much ado about nothing, farewell, my quondam comrades." ( Willful woman maun hae her way," resignedly quoted Mr. Ross. "You certainly are fickle as the wind, Margaret." She made no answer, but beneath the- drooping plume of her hat her cheek crimsoned as she bowed farewell. "Any commands for Dame Echo?" shouted Mr. More as they rode on. "My regrets. And beg her to remember the bril- liant speeches she may overhear to-day, and report faithfully to me on my next visit." ,And once more nodding good-by, she bounded away,  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7551-00000017"/> 32         S  rINoTsco. It was a lovely June morning, with that exciting freshness in, the air peculiar to mountain regions. Returning home, her purchases completed, Margaret felt an almost irresistible longing to wander at will, over hill and through valley, each rising ground seem. ing to point the way to one higher and yet more beautiful, until the horizon closed in lofty ranges, with here and there a snowy peak gleaming like a white cloud in the distance. It was a market-day, and the road and byways gay with lively groups of peasants passing to and from   Schwyz. Meadows emerald green beneath a cloudless heaven; grassy slopes, and wild rocky cliffs walling in' the road; brooks dashing, glad-voiced, down the steep declivities, or rippling lazily along beneath thb shadows of whitening or- chards; wagons glowing like so many vegetable and fiuit-gardens, drawn by sturdy horses of the district, guided by men whose cheery voices rouse the echoes with the popular Volks-Lied, or women, shepherdess- like in broad-brimmed hats, gay bodichs, and full white sleeves-these are Schwyz pictures on a bright sum- mer morning. As Margaret rode on slowly, unwilling to lose de- tail or scene of interest, a green;clad mountaineer passed by, bearing a  rifle on his shoulder, and whis- tling as he journeye.   e bowed low with an arch glance at Luise. "That is the landlord's Fritz," whispered she to her young mistress. "See, he is taking the road to Low- ez.- Why not let me give him your parcels, and ride on to Zug? The fellow will be glad enough to oblige me, that he will." And she tossed her pretty heads   INGEMSCO.         33 while the long ends of the black kerchief knotted over her fair hair fluttered in- the breeze. This proposal coincided too well with Margaret's wishes to be rejected, and mistress and maid were soon speeding on, over hill and through hollow, and never drawing bridle-rein until the precipitous banks of Lake Egeri, and the rugged mountain-steeps rising abruptly from the water's edge, burst upon their view. "That was like the wild hunter of the ballad, Lu- ise." And Margaret hummed: T Und hurre, hurre, vorwaiirts ging's, Feld ein und aus, Berg ab und an. Stets ritten Reiter rechts und links Zu beiden Seiten neben an " as she dropped the bridle on Glamis's neck, and staid to let him drink at a rivulet gushing out beneath a massive rock and foaming downward to the lake. Leaving the horses securely tethered by the road- side, Margaret, looping up the long skirt of her habit, led the way up the mountain, agile and unwearied as the young peasant. "See, mein Fraulein, what I have here for you," Luise said as, breathless at last, her mistress dropped upon a mossy cliff commanding road and lake. She drew from her capacious pocket, as she spoke, a small morocco-bound volume. "My sketch-book! O Luise! how thoughtful! But what induced you to bring it when you knew I was going to Schwyz?" ' All young ladies are not so hard to persuade as you, Fraulein. But if you sit here, may be we may see the gentlemen and ladies pass." Luise drew forth her knitting, while Margaret be-  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7551-00000018"/> 34       -  I3WBNG}3:MSCOf gan her sketch. Gifted though shewas, pencil could scarce do justice to the scenery. Above, crag towered upon crag, in all the fantastic imagery of gaunt bare rocks, rising in many a turret and natural battlement, and loftier summits surmounted by a single stately pine, tossing green, banner-like branches defiantly to the breeze. 'Twould seem that Echo, whose voice is heard among these cliffs, had fled behind their bul- warks as to a citadel of refuge. Here and there are the ragged steeps relieved by waves of verdure rolling to the foot of some precipitous ascent, while crests of snowy wind-flowers rise like foam upon the green bil- lows. Below, descend- the mountains abruptly to the lake, leaving but a narrow pass for the road. Following the windings of that road toward the west, Margaret's gaze rested upon the grim gray towers of a castle, or more properly castle-monastery, in which, in ancient, troublous times, monks gray and grim as those their ruined strongholds, had intrenched themselves. Gran- ite-bilt, three turrets of rude Gothic architecture stood strong and stalwart still, while beyond, with low massy-columned cloisters and arched chapel be- tween, were three others, of Which two mouldered away beneath the touch of time and the ruder stroke of violence--even as the zealous hands that reared them, and the faithful hearts and true, long since still- ed beneath the ruins. The ivy, asif in mockery of the destroyer, throws the banner of immortality even where destruction has been most victorious. Far to the; east, towering over all, rises Mount Einsiedlen's jagged summit, whence surges forth a flood bound in the frosts of ages, its angry waves brilliant in icy glitter in the sunshine. Almost beneath Margaret's /    feet, so sudden the desent, lay Lake Ege far below the road. In gay profusion shrub and flower clung to every foothold in the cliffs, and trees drooped their branches into the placid waters. Placid indeed at Margaret's first glance; but now, as she turns again, troubled, and dashing madly against the rocks. c' Only look at the lake, Luise," she cried after a moment; "hardly a breeze is stirring here, yet the waves are ruffled as possible. What an angry little sea!" She did not turn to Luise in speaking, else she would have been startled by the sudden dismay cloud- ing the girl's face as she lifted her eyes from her work. She rose hastily, saying: "Gracious Fraulein, perhaps the gentlemen have taken another road from the mountains. May I go ask at yonder cottage.?" pointing, to one at a short distance, where the horses had been left. Margaret nodded. Luise bounded away, and soon disappeared in the windings of the pathway. Margaret sat for another moment more, watching the waves; then to gain another view, mounted a loft- ier ascent, and wandered on, unmindful of the distance, until, on attempting to retrace her steps, she found her- self at a loss in what direction to turn, and quite out of sight of her guiding point, the lake. One crag so like another-chasms opening before her-rocky walls rearing themselves in her pathway-were so bewil- dering that at every step she wandered farther and farther into the recesses of the mountain. The wind now swept in gusts through the* forests, and, looking up, she perceived for the first time that the sky was darkening with approaching tempest.  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7551-00000019"/> 86        .iNGwMtso. Startled, she hurried on, she knew not whither, until her way was suddenly cut short by a ravine yawning at her very feet. She stopped, and trembling in every limb, leaned with closed eyes against a giant cliff that blocked the path hopelessly upon the other hand. She was no coward, but the prospect daunted her for a moment. The very atmosphere was murk and heavy with portent. The darkness deepened moment- ly. The storm must ere long break forth, and she alone, unsheltered. And even should she be unharmed by its fury, night must come before her friends could seek the lost. And had she not heard weird tales of travelers wandering up lone mountains, who never, never wandered down again? Only last year, among these very Alps--- But resolutely she put away these thoughts, pressing her hands upon her eyes to shut out dread visions; then, calm  and self-controlled, looked round. Broad and deep lay the ravine below, the precipitous sides dotted with clumps of bushes, while, their tops many, many feet beneath her, tall trees had taken root among the crags at the bottom. But the chasm narrowed where she stood, and a heavy newly-fallen oak, whose branches yet were leafy, span- ned it from brink to brink. Could she cross it? Beyond, through a cleft in the rocks she caught the ghastly white gleam of the long-lost lake in the far distance. Dared she leave that guide, and trust her- self helpless again among these cliffs? If she could but hear a  human voice amid this solitude!"Luise! Luise!" and at every cry her voice rang in sharper, steadier eagerness. Now she fancied she heard an- swering shouts, and anon her heart died within her as   raGEMsco.         s7 the sounds died away, and she knew them but the mockery of her own voice. Suddenly a deeper sound arose--so deep and wild that her lips blanched in ter- tor as she listened. Well she knew that awful sough- ing through the distant pines, now shrieking aloud in agony, now sinking low in stifled sobbing. Often in her own native highlands had she listened to the wail- ing of the storm-wind, as if in chieftain's pibroch. But deeper, wilder far, the voice of the Alpine tem- pest. It struck upon her heart, a prophecy of evil- boding, and at once with a flash of memory Luise's anxious manner, as she parted from her, recurred. She thought of the dear ones, perhaps to be exposed to the violence of the coming storm, and it lost its ter- rors for herself. Urged by the longing to bear of them, without a moment's hesitation she set her foot upon the precari- ous bridge. Fearless, thoughtless of her own dan- ger, she passed over-one instant, and she would have stood in safety on the farther side. One instant, a terrific crash of thunder reverberated far and wide-a knell of doom through all those deep-voiced caves-- and the lightning dazzled Margaret's eyes. She stag- gered and'missed her footing. Down, down she fell- oh! the lifetime of that second!-till the broken trunk of a tree, jutting out from the cruel precipice, caught her heavy riding-skirt, holding her back from that bridgeless chasm of eternity. Suspended far above the abyss, a moment passed ere she could collect her scattered senses and realize her situation. The next, with quick presence of mind, she swung gently to and fro until she succeeded in placing her foot upon a crevice in the cliff below, and  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7551-00000020"/> 3o         INGEBILXSCO, then raised herself with difficulty to a half sitting, half crouching position upon the decaying trunk. She knew she had but exchanged a swift death for one perchance but a short while deferred. For she could feel the tree vibrate beneath her weight, and heard at intervals, listening with suppressed breath, the plunge of loosened rocks and uptorn trees, hurled by-the wind down into the gulf below. She looked upward. She had not fallen twenty feet, yet a glance convinced her how worse than futile must be any at- tempt to gain that height, which offered no footing nor anyA shrub of strength sufficient to afford support. Faster and faster swept the tempest.  Thunder- peal after thunder-peal loomed from summit to defile, while vast floods of flame glared upon the angry hea- vens and the trembling earth, when the proud forests bowed, humbling themselves before the rage of the ruthless wind. Margaret knew that to call for human aid would now. be vain; but she prayed aloud in her anguish raising to the frowning skies her burning, tearless eyes. She cried to heaven in old familiar prayers, and al- though at first her thqughts could not soar, and the repetition was almost mechanical, yet the well-re- membered words soothed and sustained her, as strains of immortal music. Few the thoughts given to her- self; for her whole soul went up to the mercy-seat in yearning petitions for the safety of those she lovd Sacred promises of comfort came at length to her soul in the vividness of reality. She heard them clearly' breathed above the rolling of the thunder, the des- perate wrestling of the wind, the sullen moaning of the distant lake. and she became calm. There, hovering   INErMSCO,         39 over an abyss of dread, liable to be swept with every passing gust to an appalling death, Margaret's face bore no trace of terror. Tranquil, a rapt expression in the uplifted eyes, the lips moving in prayer, she await- ed her coming doom. But she is now no longer alone upon 'the mountain. Leaning carelessly against the rock beyond the ravine where she had stood, is a man in peasant's hunting- dress of gray-the knees exposed, as is usual with those who are wont to scale far mountain-heights. A noble figure, tall and strongly built, a face hand- some indeed, but chiefly characteristic of that strength which had set the mouth somewhat sternly, and dark- ened the brow during the more than thirty years which had apparently passed by.  Watching the storm with kindling eyes, as one who gloried in its grandeur and for whom it possesses no terrors, he stands there; but springs forward, as, glancing down into the chasm, he beholds a crouching woman's form clinging to a shattered tree. Hastily, as one too familiar with danger to heed it, he crosses upon the fallen tree. But even now, what rescue can he bring? Clearly, none, from that height. He walks back and forward once or twice, in search of some" spot whence descent may be possible. At length one is found, not impracticable, though dan- gerous, He hesitates not an instant, however, but flings himself from tree to tree, from crag to crag, un- til he stands below Margaret upon a ledge narrow in- deed, but offering a foothold to one whose nerve did not fail him. He looks up. A sudden tremor shakes him, and he is fain to grasp the trunk of a tree bend- ing near, to steady himself.  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7551-00000021"/> 40         INGEMSCO. A moment, and the serenity of her face reassured him. He called softly: "Mademoiselle! Mademoiselle!" It was as though the voice recalled her spirit to earth, She started and shuddered, looking down as he gently bade her in French: "Have a care-do not bend forward so. Attend to what I say. Can you hear me?" "Yes," was the faint reply. He drew a coil of rope from the pocket of his jacket, hastily making knots in it a foot or two apart. "It is strong, it will bear your weight," he called to her. "Secure it carefully, very carefully by this slip-knot, to the tree. Don't bend forward, Made- moiselle-you will lose your balance; keep perfectly still; trust me, I can throw it to you." And knotting the rope around a stone, with true aim he threw it to her. She fastened it to the tree, following his instructions. But it dangled in the air, far above, out of his reach. She looked down with a face of blank dismay upon him standing there with brows contracted in thought. "Would it be possible to remain where you are, un- til I seek and bring assistance?" he asked, after an in- stant's consideration. "The trunk is loosened now," she answered hoarsely. "There is but this one way, then. Mademoiselle, can you resolutely do as I bid you, knowing the risk? or will you await there a certain destruction?" She grew even paler than before, yet her white lips did not tremble, as she replied firmly: "' I will obey you." "Disengage your dress, then, carefully from the tree.   INGEMSCO.         41 Now be prepared to move from: your position, your arms about the tree. Then descend by the rope; the knots will give your hands some stay. Close your eyes when you have firm hold of the rope, lest you become dizzy. Move very gently and deliberately, lest a sudden shock loosen the tree. Do not look for a footing when you reach the end of the rope, but merely release your hold, and leave the rest to me. Remember, all depends upon no struggle, no effort to save yourself at the last." He spoke very slowly and distinctly, to give her confidence by his own calmness. And it was in a tone steady as his own, that she asked presently: "Are you ready?" "Come-and God guard you!" "God help us both!"And with closed eyes and moving lips she glided down the rope. Passing his left arm closely round the tree, his right foot firmly planted forward, his right arm outstretched, he stands awaiting her. Pale he is, even to the com- pressed lips; but he follows her every movement with a gaze bearing him witness that no thought of his own danger has thus blanched his cheek and concentrated such fearful agony in his watchful eyes. She is near now--almost within his grasp; but one struggle of hers-one misstep of his-may dash both into the gulf below. She draws near--nearer-is at the end of the rope at last, after seconds that are hours to both.

She leans against him for a mo- ment with drooping eyelids, dizzy and faint. Her hand rested on his arm, and he felt now warm trickling drops upon his hand. It was blood, and when he raised her hand he saw it flowing freely from a deep gash in the wrist. "What is this? You are hurt!" he said anxiously. "It is nothing-I scarcely feel it-but-I did' not think I was so childishy weak," she answered shiv- ering, as with gentle touch he bound up the wound. C Not weak-passing strong and brave indeed. But the greatest danger is past. Can you dare the rest? These cliffs are far more formidable in appearance than in reality they are," he said encouragingly. "I think I can." She tried to steady her voice, with. drawing at the same time farther from his supporting arm. He bent his head, looking in her face, where the varying color belied her words. 1No, Mademoiselle, you can not.' "There," she said, with an attempt at cheerfulness, C there, onl that rock. I am not afraid to stay there; and you will come again-you will send assistance very soon?" "Hark!" he replied "'do you not hear the rocks and trees crashing momently around us?  You must not wait for other assistance than mine. You must-, She shook her head. "INo. You have already so nobly periled your life for mine, that you shall not risk it further."

She seated herself upon a rock as he released her, standing near, his brow bared to the wind that tossed back the clustering waves of chestnut hair. In his face she, glancing up, assuredly recognized the strong- ly-marked, handsome features of her deliverer. But the keen, dark-blue eyes looking down with gaze in- tent almost to fierceness upon the-dangers escaped, were how different from the eyes that in the'midst of those dangers looked so gently into her own, bidding her fear not. And in the curves of the firm, finely-cut mouth as it settled in repose, was a cold scorfiilness but slightly vailed by the drooping brown moustache. Margaret hesitated to address him, but presently began softly: "How shall I ever thank you?" He turned. "By trusting me yet further. Made- moiselle, you are not safe even here, although more sheltered than below. The storm  is not yet at its height, and will probably not have spent its strength till evening. Do you see those drifting clouds, black with heavy rain? Beyond the ravine we shall find shelter. Will you trust me to take you across that very primitive bridge?  I assure you I have crossed it and recrossed it many times." Margaret shuddered. "In crossing that, I fell. But I will go if it must be so." "No absolute necessity," was the cold response. "I will go;, Ohe said at once, her pride roused by the tone. *               ,  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7551-00000023"/> "   -     z  Msco. And rising, she would have attempted the cross- ing unassisted, but again he drew his arm around her. He paused on-gaining the other side, and looked down into the ravine. "Look-the fate you have escaped," he said. She followed his guiding eyes. The shatteredtree, the frail support to which she had clung, shook and trembled with every blast, and loosened earth and stones fell from the uptorn roots, dashing against the crags below. Presently a stronger gust-- a heavier crash-and the tree was gone! Margaret covered her face with her hands. ".And this I owe to you," she murmured. "As much to your own calmness, your own courage. Had you feared, even faltered , His voice grew husky. Margaret first broke the silence that ensued. a And where is our refuge?" she inquired. "That rock," and he pointed to the vast pile whence her startled eyes had first met the ravine. ,c On the further side we shall find the shelter of a cave." One might almost have fancied 'this rock the struc. ture of human toil, so like a fortress-tower it arose frowning over the chasm below. A narrow rugged [edge belted it, and this, holding by the wall above, Vargaret's deliverer traversed, lifting her as easily as f  she had been a child.

When the dizzy whirl passed away, and -she could again collect her thoughts, she glanced round in search of her rescuer. He stood abstracted at the entrance through which now dashed- the fast coming rain. A gloom so heavy darkened his brow that Margaret, watching, was touched, and said softly: "See, Monsieur, how fast the rain is falling. I en- treat you, do not stand there in the storm. Will you not come within?" Hardly turning, and not looking at her as he spoke, he thanked her, but declined very decidedly, somewhat abruptly. She flushed deeply, and, averting her eyes, examined for the first time her temporary abode. The cave was of granite, loftily arched, and adorned with nature's careless sculpturing in the roof. And medieval art had here lent rude aid to nature; for on the rugged wall opposite the entrance was carved a massive cross, beneath it a sort of shelf, and in the wall beside Margaret a long narrow bench, all hewn in the solid rock. This had been the cell, doubtless, of some hoary anchorite whose name has passed from earth long ages since, but whose sign-manual of de- votion remains a monument of the -devotee while the everlasting mountains stand. Margaret gazed in awe. In imagination she saw the reverend bowed head and  clasped hands before that shrine, and upon the rude shelf the deaths head beside the illuminated missal. ^ i  t But suddenly, as the wind swept by in wilder ca-      -:A dence, a deep fear smote upon her, and burying her face in her hands her whole frame shook with sup  **  . .   -       &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7551-00000024"/> 40         INGEMTSCOo pressed sobs. Every thunder-roll, every lightning- flash flaring through the gloom upon the walls around, every blast, and crash of tottering crag or uprooted timber, thrilled her very soul as she thought of her father, of Alice, and that other whom in her heart she called always her old friend. Until despair seized her, and she would have rushed out into the tempest, seek- ing them, had not that quiet figure stood there fixed as fate, closing, she well knew, all exit. Time passed, but Margaret moved not; only the quivering of her frame showed her living and suffer- ing. Her head, drooping upon one arm, rested on the bench, while the right hand, clenched to repress fast-. coming sobs, pressed convulsively the cold stone. Meantime her companion had stood gazing fixedly out. Now he turned, casting a glance upon her. For the -first time he beheld her agitation. His face soft- ened, he'moved away from the opening and approached her. On her ear,; straining after beloved voices, listen- ing in all-engrossing eagerness for every gust,.his step fell unheeded and-he watched her unobserved.!He was deeply moved. Involuntarily he laid his hand upon the little one resting on the bench. "Are you afraid?" he asked tenderly. "Do not weep thus, my poor child." She raised her head and fixed her eyes wildly upon him. "My father," she gasped. "Alice, Harry, they too are on the mountain." "They are safe. Be comforted. I met them de- scending as the storm atose. They followed the val- ley road." In her agitation she had used her native language,   IGwRTSCO .        47 and he replied in the same, dropping the French from thenceforward. " bAnd I came in the opposite direction," she cried, radiant with joy. Now for the first time she felt his clasping hand. Hers fluttered an instant, and was released. "But Luise, my maid," she faltered presently. "Where was she';' , We rode hither together, hoping to find our party; and while she left me on an errand, I strolled off and lost my way." "She is Swiss?"  Yes," and she looked inquirmingly at her interrogator. "Do not alarm yourself, then *," he rejoined, "these mountaineers are familiar with every change of the weather. Beyond doubt she is safely housed long ere this." "But she knew I was alone on the mountain. She would return to seek me," replied Margaret, only half convinced. He smiled sarcastically. "Have you then so much faith in human nature?" he asked. "Have not you?" "I have none." "Yet," she returned quickly, "you risked your life for a stranger. Do not measure mankind by a lower standard than yourself. Many must fall far short of it, but some  " "Do not misunderstand me, Mademoiselle. It is because I do so measure human nature, that I distrust it.

The bitter melancholy of his tone and the despair of the life thus revealed to her, struck' a chill to her heart. A long silence ere he spoke again. "Might I ask you a question, Mademoiselle, without seeming impertinent?" "You would ask nothing impertinent," she replied simply. "Will you tell me what you were saying to your- self as I came so gallantly to the rescue? Nay," ob- serving that she colored painfully, and. dropping the light tone in which he had before spoken, "my ques- tion is not indeed prompted by idle curiosity. On the very verge of a fearful death-but a breath of the tempest between you and eternity--you were calm as now, and almost a smile upon your lips. And life must be sweet to you." With reverently bowed head and flushing cheek she repeated: "Whoso dwelleth under the defense of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.' " "Who is worthy to feel that assurance?" after a pause he said.        , "None are worthy. '"Bis faithfulness And truth shall be thy shield and buckler.'" "Ay, but to whom is the promise?' he asked ear- nestly. Her head still bent, and the color mounting to her brow, she answered: "To those who say, ' In Him will I trust.'  He made no reply, and Margaret, deep in the thoughts which his words had awakened, drooped her forehead on her hand, shading her face. He re-   INGEMSCO.         49 mained there still, looking down steadfastly upon her, until,? rousing himself at last, with an impatient gpsture, he said, looking at his watch: "Four o'clock! Mademoiselle, are you not hun- gry?" "Indeed I am. But appetites are superfluous to storm-staid pilgrims in a deserted hermitage." "Shall we make an inroad on the hermit's larder?" "Hermit's larder! Are not the two ideas incom- patible?" "Surely, Mademoiselle, you would not condemn the unfortunate to a winter fare of snow-flakes and icicles? Berries are not to be plucked all the year." "Ah! true. Then you think there is a larder? But where?" He pointed out an opening in the rock at a sharp angle which she had not observed. They traversed a straightened passage widening by degrees into another cave, smaller and less perfect than the first, inasmuch as here and there the walls gaped in great rents, .through which trees and shrubs manifold intruded. Nor impervious to the weather, for the rocky roofing did not extend over the entire space. A shelf was carved here also in the wall, but its contents manifestly did not belong to antiquity. A rifle, belt, and powder-flask, a venison ham, a tin canister, a silver drinking-cup, and a clasp-knife. "What have we here? Venison, instead of lentils and-cresses-and actually--yes, actually-ground cof- fee!"Margaret exclaimed as she lifted the top from the canister, pouring a few grains into her hand. "And a rifle and powder too! Methinks, Monsieur, we have penetrated into the cell of the jolly Friar Tuck"  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7551-00000026"/> i50        INGFTMTSCO. "Have you scruples of conscience regarding the venison?" "Not I. I am far too hungry for that. But only think what a valuable discovery we have made. - The style of carving in both caverns certainly belongs to the thirteenth century, and yet here we find both gun and powder; ergo, in the thirteenth century hermits were much given to the chase, and wont to hunt with the rifle. I foresee the complimentary greetings of all learned antiquaries," she said gayly. "You have overlooked another noteworthy and to us just now very valuable fact, Mademoiselle. You perceive that in the middle ages the art of curing hams was carried to such perfection that they could be pre- served in fact during several centuries." "Assuredly. Meanwhile, before becoming distin- guished let us dine. If you will bring the wood, I'll make the fire, and we shall have broiled venison and delicious coffee." There was a quantity of brushwood and dry branch- es about the cave. These he brought, and building 'them up in the requisite form, gave Margaret the tin- der-box, and stood by, watching as she struck match after match, and applied herself to blowing the strug- gling flame. And indeed it was a picture worth the watching as she knelt there with so much unaffected grace. Her hat had been laid aside, and her hair, from which, in her fall, she had lost the comb that confined it, swept in massive waves upon the ground as she stooped, intent upon her self-imposed task, rounding her full red lips into the semblance of an opening rosebud, in the effort to ignite the refractory fire.   INGEMSCO.         51 At length she raised her head, and caught the amused smile with which her companion regarded her. She rose immediately, and, half laughing, half vexed, turned to him her flushed face. "Are you not ashamed," she cried, out of breath, "to stand there laughing at me instead of proving that you can do better? Come, or you shall have no dinner." "Pardon me," was the rejoinder. "So absorbed was I in looking at you in your novel employment, that I quite forgot my duty." A few judicious arrangements of the fuel by him, and the whole burst forth into a bright blaze. "What can you not do, from the rescuing of forlorn damsels to the making of obstinate fires?" exclaimed Margaret, standing by, lost in wonder. "Very many things," he responded, between jest and earnest. "Par exemple?" "The making of the delicious coffee you so rashy promised. Can you, Mademoiselle?" "Of course, what is easier? If you will but fill this canister with water, we shall soon have it boiling, and then we can draw the coffee presently." "I believe you know something of tea,", he said with a smile; "but I would advise you to leave the coffee to me." She laughed. "Is mine an original recipe?  Then I have no objections to act under your directions." And under his instructions she progressed, until the repast was served upon a broad tabular rock. "On a servi, Monsieur," she said, standing with  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7551-00000027"/> 52         INGsrITSCO. folded hands and dropping an antiquated courtesy. "But where are the hermit's plates?" "These are his summer service," and he gathered a handful of the large leaves that had forced them- selves through a crevice in the cave. "Forks were a luxury introduced at a later period, were they not?" "They were, but knives answered every purpose," he replied, giving her a delicate penknife and reserv- ing the antiquarian clasp-knife. "And the Coffee-cup has double duty to per- form." "It is very capacious, as you see, so that, if you pre- fer, we can as a preliminary at once divide the 'de- licious -coffee,' I retaining the lion's share with the canister." "I think," said Margaret, gazing thoughtfully down into the coffee-grounds at the bottom of her now al- most exhausted cup, "I think playing the hermit so delightful that I believe I should like to be one in very truth. Would not you?" "I am not sure. Do you think a fairy queen would come every day to put out the fires, draw the coffee, and brighten the dark cavern with her smile?" "I am afraid not; fairies are ever wayward," she answered gayly. "Yet if you offer such inducements! I know not if venison be fairy food, but I am confi- dent Titania herself would not scorn this." The sumptuous banquet at length brought to a conclusion, Margaret replaced upon the shelf every relic of antiquity. As she did so, the device upon the silver drinking-cup caught her attention. It was a lonely tower wrought in relief, and upon the parapet   INGEMSCO.         53 a single fragile flower. Beneath, were the initials E. L Z. '"A beautiful crest," she remarked, "and one that seems to speak of lordly strength opposed to foes, and protection offered to clinging friends." "It would bear yet another interpretation, Made- moiselle. It would signify the one fair and lowly flower blossoming in a gloomy prison-life. As such it was chosen by the son of a peasant-girl." Margaret glanced up in surprise. She had long since recognized Alice's Count. Yet his words would seem to declare an humble lineage. But she put down the cup without further comment. As they reentered the outer cave, he said: "It is well your accident occurred near here. To be unsheltered in this tempest would have been most dangerous. I myself have frequently been obliged to take refuge here, and several times have been impris- oned for more than twenty-four hours. Therefore I thought of stocking the Hermit's larder, after a fashion."      * "Oh!" she cried, "by all that is romantic, do not banish the dark ages by throwing into the cave the sudden glare of the present." "By all means then exclude it. We will remain antiquarians," he rejoined. Meanwhile the storm had spent its fury, and noth- ing was heard save a distant moaning like wails from stricken hearths after the raging of a mortal battle. The shades of evening were falling duskily, occa- sional gusts swept over the lake, warning that the tempest was not yet quite past, when Margaret and the Count gained the road after descending the moun-  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7551-00000028"/> 54         NXGEMSCO, tain at almost the same point whence she had that morning ascended. Margaret, overworn with fatigue, threw herself upon the fallen tree by the wayside. "I can never hope to repay all this day's debt of kindness," she said, "and yet I must ask of you some- thing more. Luise, I may not leave her." "I will gladly do all you wish. But you must allow me first to care for you. You must be aware that it is quite impossible you should reach Lowerz to-night. If you would accept shelter beneath my roof, I have an old housekeeper who would take excellent care of you. There is no other house -near, where you could remain with any comfort, and I will dispatch a messenger instantly for your father." She hesitated. "I think Luise and I could ride home if you-if you would send some one with us." "Pardon me, I am sure you can not. Your very voice trembles. And here is a pulse," touching for an instant her slender wrist, " that needs but little more fatigue and exposure to beat high in fever. And see how densely the clouds are gathering again. Made- moiselle, 'twere as well I had left you to this morn- ing's danger if you will not yield to me in this." She looked somewhat troubled, but consented. "As you will," she said, "if only you first find Luise. It was to yonder cottage that she went this morning." "But I can not leave you here. You must first-- " "No, no," she cried impatiently, "I will not. I will not move until she comes. Go, pray go. I am not afraid."    INGEr SCO.        55 At that moment a loud clear shout resounded through the defiles. ( It is-it must be-Luise!"Margaret cried. And Luise it was. Guided by the Count's answer- ing shouts, she soon appeared, followed by several men. A few words explained her movements. After un- successful inquiries concerning the missilig party, she had retraced her steps to warn Margaret of the ap- proaching danger. She had wandered in search of her, until, remembering her own, helplessness without a guide, and alarmed for her mistress by the increas- ing violence of the storm, she hastened to return to the cottage, there to obtain aid more efficient.' The promise of this she without difficulty obtained, but was almost forcibly detained until there was compar- ative safety in the ascent of the mountain. Margaret gave the Count a triumphant smile. Then telling her plans to Luise, whom she had some trouble to persuade out of her fears of the haunted castle, she bade her, giving her at the same time her purse, direct the men to the spot where the horses had been secured. The girl made some reply in a low voice. As she ended, Margaret turned again to the Count. 4 "My horse was killed in the storm," she said, her lip quivering. "Mine is near, at your service." . And turning to the men, he sent one in search of the animal, and directed another to his stables, whence he was to ride post-haste to- "Your address, Mademoiselle? Or, stay, it would be much better were you to write a line." She remembered her sketch-book which she had  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7551-00000029"/> 56       -N GMTSco. slipped in her pocket before setting forth on that ad- venturous ramble. And drawing it forth, she hastily tore out a leaf, and scribbled a few lines by the waning light. "My father is, I know, scouring the country toward Schwyz in search of me. I rode thither this morning, and he knows .nothing of my attempt to join him," she said, as she directed and gave the note to the Count. He borrowed her pencil, and added some words upon the back before hurrying the messenger away. Margaret averted her head, shading her face, but the Count standing beside her, presently saw the tears streaming fast through her slender fingers. After a moment he spoke: "Was the horse a favorite of yours.?" he asked. "My dear old Glamis! I brought him from my home in Scotland; and to die thus--crushed by the falling of a tree " "I heard the peculiar, wild death-cry of a horse almost immediately after our entrance into the cave. I feared then, it might be my own'." She raised to him her eyes, in which tears yet glis- tened, "I am glad it was not yours," she said softly, She thought him almost rude as he moved abrupt- ly from her side to the road, where he remained, pac- ing up and down, until the horses arrived. Even then he allowed Luise's companion, who was no other than the morning's acquaintance, Flitz, to assist Margaret in mounting, but came forward as she was seated in the saddle, and laid his hand upon the arched neck of the restive horse that, rubbing his   rNGaIsco.         57 head in loving recognition against his master's arm, walked now quietly -beside him. Arrived at the Castle, the Count, calling Luise to follow, gave Margaret his arm through the- dim clois- ters, and up a winding flight of massive stone stairs in the east tower,.where, on the first landing, a door stood hospitably open. As Margaret's eyes recovered from the sudden blaze of light; she looked around in astonishment. The apartment, spacious and lofty, was fitted up most luxuriously. Upon the threshold, one parted with every vestige of the ancient ruin, entering into a Parisian boudoir. All was modern here, excepting only the carved Gothic roof of oak and the deep em- brasured windows, shaded however, by rose-colored silk and lace. Choice paintings hung upon the walls, -books and music were there in profusion. Observing Margaret's surprise, her host explained: "I once imagined my sister would call this her home.  These apartments were prepared for her. Zozia I!"-to an old woman who made her appearance in- the doorway-of the adjoining chamber--"this is the lady for whom I sent you word to prepare. See that you show her every attention. Miss Ross, I shall presently send you medicine in the shape of a substantial supper, and allow me to recommend a glass of wine. Your father can not fail to be here very soon; he will occupy the room above. Good- night!" Margaret returned his bow-then, with a sudden impulse, extended her hand. - You must let me thank you after the manner of my country," she said.

In their clear, calm depths was no wavering, no shrinking from, no consciousness of, the fire kindling in his. He was paler as he turned away. Old Zozia followed him with a steady gaze until the door closed, and then, darting a glance of mingled fear and hate upon Margaret, muttered some words in her native Polish tongue. She could speak German, however, and soon ad- dressed herself to the comfort of both, mistress and maid. An hour later, and Margaret slumbers peacefully beneath the roof of the Haunted Castle, her father's kiss sealing her lips, and his deep joy over the lost that is found gladdening her dreams. What though a troubled spirit wander in restless vigil' amid driving wind and heavily-falling rain, be- neath her darkened windows? What though a shriveled face with baleful eyes look down upon the wanderer beneath, and then across at those windows, while shrunken lips mutter in wrathful maledictions upon the firank-browed sy- ren who has robbed her of 'her boy." o Still, she sleeps on. fc          .

A DISMAL, drizzling morning, prophetic of a long, dull, changeless day. Margaret, in the hospitably embracing arms of an easy-chair, is listlessly turning over the leaves of a familiar volume by her old favorite Jean Paul. She is possessed by a restless spirit; has tried half a dozen bars of half a dozen pieces upon the full-toned grand piano; ranged through as many pages of light French German or English literature, with a feeling that they, or her mind, were dismally befogged through those level drifting clouds gathering without. Heri sketch-bookl lies beside4ier, open at a hasty drawing of the Hermit's Cave, and she glances at it with a half smile, sighing at the same time, partly in remem- brance of anguish whose wound was yet too fresh to 'bear the touch; partly perhaps for that romance which now  seemed broken off and unlinked ^with every day life. She began to wonder whether there was reality in the scenes of yesterday; and as if to con-  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7551-00000031"/> 6()        INGEHSCO. vince herself, she described the cave to Luise, asking if she had ever heard of it. Luise was sitting at the window with that insepara- ble knitting-work, yawning over the prospect for the day, and envying Mr. Ross, who had just ridden by on his way to Lowerz. Only on a morning visit, how- ever; for, yielding to his host's urgent hospitality and the warning given Margaret by the clouds, he had consented to extend the visit to the Castle until the morrow, merely riding over to relieve the anxious ones at home. He was also the bearer of condolences to Alice, on the misfortune of not having fallen down a precipice into the arms of an unknown hero, nor having been stormstaid and benighted, mounted on the incomparable black steed, and thus winning her wager. As Margaret spoke, the girl turned quickly, cross- ing herself with a look of horrified surprise. "Surely, gracious Fraulein, you have not been in that cave? What, and in the storm too?" as her mis- tress nodded. "The holy saints defend us!" "From what, Luise? Let us have the whole story, for story there must be," Margaret said, her curios- ity immediately awakened by the mysterious words and evident alarm. Luise, her face still expressive of horror, yet fold- ing her hands over her knitting with the conscious air of an oracle, began: "It is an- old story, my young lady, which my grandmother-she was born and lived here in Zug, until she married and went away to Glarus-would tell 6ver to us children in the long winter evenings, whle we would sometimes, I warrant you, creep close   INGEMSCO,         61 enough to her knee as the wind afar among the pines on the mountains beyond the lake, seemed to sJhriek, trying to drown her words, though the untrodden snow kept all quiet about the door. But then we threw on pine knots that made a roaring blaze, while Franz sat in the chimney-corner mending his nets for the early fishing, and grandmother went on, Sanchen and I taking turns at the old spinning-wheel, Ours was 'the fairest linen in all the country round, Miss, the neighbors used to say; and next month, when Sanchen is married--  But thinking on grandmother and the little cottage makes me forget my story. I wish you could hear her tell it; but here it is, as well as I remember. "In the old, old time-even my grandmother does not know how many hundred years ago--this very cas- tle was a monastery, and the fame of it went abroad far and wide, for its holy brethren, and for the miracles they performed and the good works they wrought. Now there dwelt hard by, in the recesses of the mountains, a mighty baron, on whose ripening acres the sun rose first and set the latest, whose jewels and whose old wines gleamed the brightest, whose cas- tle walls stood strongest, whose retainers rode the swiftest, whose blows fell heaviest, and whom all the people feared. And they followed at his call as his hounds followed, when he dashed across their fair- est fields, trampling down the headed, grain, just like the knight in your song yesterday, Fraulein. Or like the hunted chamois they fled before him in his wrath. And they hid -in darksome caverns, as:those who fear the light/ or-well, they say he was a gen- erous master to the ravening eagles on these heights.  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7551-00000032"/> 62         XNGEaSCO. However that may be, he ruled, and if he looked darkly at the clouds, all -the peasants carried their umbrellas. "All? No, there was one who feared him not. "Down in the valley beneath the grim old castle, dwelt the fairest maid in all the canton. The sun- beams were not brighter nor more frequent than her smile, and the falling snow not fairer than her brow and heart., All the people loved her, and she knew no other name than the sunshine of Egeri. It was on a fair spring evening, just as the sun dipped down be- hind the mountains, that she stood beside the brook in the little glen where her mother's cottage hid among the trees, and heard on a sudden the clatter- ing of many hoofs behind her. She had been rinsing a basket of linen in the running stream, and as she rose, tossing in the last piece, with the flush of the sunset on her cheek, and the water trickling from her white upraised arms, as she twined together the great waves of golden hair that had rolled down to her knee, singing- low to herself the while-she looked, grandmother used to say, like the lovely Lurlei maids who chant such sweet strains from the moonlit waves, that the boatman who listens hears no more voice of conscience or of earth. 'Only this was a good maiden, for all that. "Well, on came the clatter of the hoofs-ringing ar- mor, waving plumes, a goodly cavalcade, and the bold baron at the head. On they dashed; but the baron suddenly checked his horse. He had espied her, still as if rooted on the rock, gazing after them in innocent admiration and yet fear. For ever before, when the drawhridge of the great castle dropped for   INGEMSCO.         63 the baron to ride forth, the aged mother would sum- mon her in hastily to spinning-wheel or broidery-frame, saying, 'Get thee in, child. Yon steel gleams bravely in the sunlight, but it pierces dark and cold in the peasant's heart.' 'And how came the maiden out that evening?" questioned Margaret, as Luise stopped for breath. -"That I can not tell," she replied perplexedly, "unless the dame might have gone away to vespers, for she was a good old soul. Nun! stock-still stop- ped the .baron, and fixed his bold eyes upon the maiden. "' Haf' he cried, 'a rare wild-flower, by all that's fair! Halloo, knights one and all-the fullest beaker to-night, and the- swiftest horse in my stables on the morrow, to him who gathers me yon May-bloom.' "At the word there is a rush of steeds, and before the terrified Madchen can turn to fly, one of the re- tainers has caught her from the ground at one rushing swoop, and relinquished her, half senseless, to his mas- ter, who held her before him on the saddle. "Only one wild cry she gave, --and then it seemed voice failed her. Hope of rescue was there none; she was alone; and moreover who would dare gainsqy the noble baron? "An abrupt turn of the road-in another moment the drawhridge must be crossed. When out into the road, his grasp upon the baron's bridle, springs a young peasant. , "There is a glitter of steel as he raises his right arm, a fiendish glitter in the baron's eyes as, quick as thought, ere the swift blow descends, he flings the maiden between, while the cry of glad surprise is yet upon her lips.  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7551-00000033"/> "        INGEMSCO. "The swift blow descends, through and through her heart; the life-blood spouts warm on her deliv- erer's hand. "One instant he gazed on it steadfastly, muttering, CBetter-better even thus,' when a dozen blows are aimed at him, and he turns, springing from crag to crag, swift and sure-footed as the chamois." "And took refuge in that cave?"Margaret asked eagerly, in the pause. "'The saints forbid! But in the monastery. And the baron, bold and impious that he was, dared to demand him of the holy brotherhood, threatening to drag him from the very altar's foot if they refused. But you may be sure refuse they did. "Now there was there another peasant, a dark, ill- looking fellow enough, whom nobody liked, and the maiden least of all, so that she had given him the basket for the poor brave lad who spilled her blood. He, some say, went by night to the baron, and bar- gained with him to deliver the monastery into his hands. For it was well known throughout the land that no weapon raised against those walls might avail aught. And all the brethren were gathered together in a strong tower apart, from which a secret passage led into the chapel, far beneath the ground, so that no enemy could approach them any way. "One cold stormy night-months had gone by, and midwinter was then come, bleaker and more tempest- uous than ever before known in all this mountain-land -the holy brotherhood were all at their prayers in the chapel, when, just as the great bell is on the stroke of twelve-for it is a midnight mass-and the wind suddenly rising sweeps round the walls shrieking and   INGIEMSCO.        65 sobbing like a doomed soul-klop! klop!-here comes a knocking at the inner gate. Now you must know, that ever since the insolent threats of the mighty baron, the outer gates were always kept fast locked and double-locked, and one would think only Satan himself could whisk through the key-hole or the cre- vices, even were any bold enough to venture forth on such a night as this. So you may imagine how the reverend brethren one and all scrambled in haste to their legs, and even the father abbot himself, though he stood his ground at first, stumbled over the Latin in his book. And how all of them, from sacristan to father abbot, made the best of their way to the gate; though when there they stopped, debating whether to open it, some advising to exorcise the Evil One from the sacred ground. Until through a lull in the storm came again that knocking, and a feeble voice beseech- ing shelter in the name of the blessed saints. Upon which the abbot, who was a good man and a chari- table, caused to open to the stranger. "It was an aged man apparently, who stood leaning there upon his pilgrim's staff. For his beard crept down long and grizzly to his hempen girdle, and his back was bowed and bent. Yet was a strange, wild fierceness in the glance he cast around, as he followed through the chapel, and his eyes fell upon the poor dying lad who alone of all remained undisturbed on his knees amid all this confusion. And his muttered benedicite had in is sound somewhat of a maledic- tion. But he had a wonderful story of a vision and a dream; how in his deep slumber he was upborne by a mighty wind and carried from many a long league away, beipg set down right here at the inner gate, to  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7551-00000034"/> "        rGNGEMSCO. warn the worthy abbot and the brotherhood, whose. fame was noised so far, of a coming danger and a coming foe. So when the norrow's sun glittered on the spears and lances and the steel trappings of the baron's warlike hosts, the simple-minded brethren paid reverence to the stranger almost before their good old abbot himself. "The monastery was now besieged; and, taken so at unawares, provisions soon were running short. But the pilgrim friar dreamed yet another dream, and on the morrow told unto the brethren how it was re- vealed to him, that, beneath a certain buttress beside the outer wall, might be found that coming night stores to live upon in plenty for yet another week. So they hearkened to his words, leading him forth and back through the subterranean passage. And many another dream he dreamed, all thus fulfilled within the time appointed, until he was honored more and more, and fully intrusted with the keys and all the secret of the passage. "And then-ach! liebes Fraulein, it is a cruel, cruel story. "Another dark and stormy night. Not one ray of light through the pitchy midnight, and the wind howling, yet always louder and louder, so that naught else may be heard save the muttered prayers of the holy brothers as they cross themselves, listening to the storm, or from time to time feeling for each other with awe-struck voices in the dense darkness. For all within the strong tower were they gathered, and the fuel was all spent at last, and, ganz gewiss, the dreaming friar must have a dream once again, and is gone out into the murky tempest, bidding the breth-   - IGEMrSCO.       67 ren be of good cheer, for he will return anon, and then it will be. many a long night ere they want for food and flame. The darkness hid his strange smile as he said these words, and the great- doors clanged be- hind him with a hollow echo. "An hour is gone, and the dark and the cold weigh heavier and heavier, until the warmth of prayer it- self is chilled and a dull fqreboding glooms on all as they kneel there apart or gather closer, grasping each other by the hand. Suddenly, slowly, faint and hol- low as distant smothered moans, tolls the chapel-bell, rung by no brother's hands, the solemn midnight- hour. And now mingling, now surging shrill above it, the wind, shrieking a wild unearthly shriek, shakes the tower to the very foundations. And now another sound, of trampling feet-a sharp loud crash, and knacks! grind the iron doors back upon their hinges. "A glare of torchght and of steel. Foremost in that armed band, entering, dashing back even the bold baron in his bloody rage and haste, is the dreaming friar, now no longer bowed and gray-bearded. At one stride he has crossed the stone pavement, already slippery with blood, to where before a cross apart- a tiny cross of rubies red and pure as maiden's blood -the blood that spirted on his hand from her pure heart, and would not thence into the dust-a fair- haired youth is kneeling with clasped hands. Once and twice he plunged his dagger in the quiet heart. The youth moves not, nor falls. And the torchght flickers on the still, rapt smile of those wan lips.

Death had cheated him of his victim." Luise paused, and Margaret drew a long breath, "And what then, Luise? Is that all?" she asked. looking for poetical justice of some degree. s Leider, dear young lady, that was all of the holy brotherhood. But the false one, the traitor, he aveng- ed them. For with him vanished for the baron and his band all hope of escape from the grim tower, for they knew not the secret of the passage. And there they were, shut up forever with the murdered, and there their bones bleached side by side, and the shin- ing casque was as brave a banquet-hall for the death- worm as the monk's cowl." Margaret shuddered. "But," she said presently, "all this has nothing to do with my cave. I thought your story had some connection with that." 'And so it has, dear Fraulein. You shall hear. For when the false one fled, and not alone-for re- morse and fear followed fast behind-where should he take refuge but in -this cavern which God had so cut off from man. There he carved out a cross in the hard, cold rock-and who knows but remorse with its sharp knife might have left the impress -of the cross in that hard, cold heart of his? Be that as it may, however, the years went by, and each as it went laid a heavy hand upon the desolate towers of the monas- tery, until year by year they crumbled and fell.

"Now there was among the followers of the bold baron a coward loon, who that fell night crouched without the gates, waiting in fear and trembling till the blows should all be spent-till the hour for plun- der should be come. And back he slunk to his den amid the mountains, in greater fear than ever before, as the solemn monastery bell tolled forth that mid-' night knell for the unshriven buried alive within the holy precincts. "Wohlan! Years had passed, as I said, and the false friar all the time dwelt as true hermit and holy, in solitude unbroken. Until one night, just twenty years after that dread night, when the storm howled without, and the wind shrieked at the entrance of the cave, suddenly arose another and a wilder shriek, and the very storm reechoed it above the thunder. Then rose the hoary hermit from his knees and hastened out into the night, following the direction of the cry. The lightning pointed out his pathway, and there, at his feet, where the precipice yawned so fearful-there, clinging to a rock far down its side, and in momently danger of falling-was a man in huntsman's garb. "Gracious lady, the holy saints must have helped him, or he never could have rescued ,him in such a tempest, leading him in safety to the cavern. Or, some say it was the devil in the huntsman's garb- for I think the devil gets into it sometimes, especially in a season when game is scarce, and the hunting is restricted; however that be, on that same midnight the old chapel-bell, which had long lain rusted among the ruins, and at last had disappeared, no one knew  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7551-00000036"/> 70        mINGEMSCO. where, tolled forth a long deep knell that was heard far and wide; and as the startled peasants came to their doors to listen, a wild prolonged shriek chimed in the distance. It was the devil who, on that dr6ad anniversary, attempted to carry off the anchorite; and that cry was his as the holy man laid the cross upon- his brow, where every ruby burned like coals ;of fire, while the angels came and bore the hermit away in their arms. Some say it was the hermit's yell, when the man he had saved grappled with him in the entrance to the cave, the very man who slunk away from the monastery that night twenty years agone, and who now, dazzled by the blaze of that ruby cross, thought to wrest it from the bowed man standing unawares at the entrance, to hurl him at one blow down into the} gulf below, and to find c6n- cealed in the cave the whole rich plunder of the mon- astery. But certain it is, that the Evil One had some- what to do with the matter, for no trace of the bod- ies was ever found. And ever since every one, and huntsmen in especial, avoid that cave. A spell rests on it. When two are met within, and one bears the symbol of the holy cross, he obtains mastery over the other for life and death. But woe betide him if he ever lose that cross or yield it'! Then is he in the power of the foul fiend who, on that night, was dis- mayed by the cross alone, and " "But," Margaret interrupted, as with a half smile she drew back her sleeve and with it the embroidered kerchief binding the red wound upon her white arm, "but, Luise, surely it is not so very dreadful a catas- trophe to gain power over any one, that your hunts- men should avoid the cave on that account. Me-   INGEMSCO.         t  thinks many would venture it upon the marriage-day, like a visit to our well of St. Keyne." "I don't know, Fraulein, any thing about the well of St. Keyne," responded Luise, looking up aghast at her mistress's light tone, "bbut this I do know, that not even to rule the goodman would I be mad enough to even so much as peep within that cave. For he who gains the power, surrenders happiness in ex change for it, and there is fierce enmity between the two. And the devil tries and tries unceasingly to tempt away the cross, that the power may belong to himself. Moreover, because the huntsman's dress did not effectually conceal his cloven hoof, the devil has all the more sworn vengeance against all huntsmen in that cave, so that none dare venture there; for even with the cross, they can not be secure against the devil's arts to wile it from them. And then all the sights and sounds of the devil's raising-one must hear all these for evermore. Ach, mein Fraulein! it must be fearful!" and with an unaffected shudder she turned again to her work. Margaret had caught somewhat of the superstitious infection, and smiled at her sudden start as a quick tap sounded at the door. Blushed too, and hastily fastened the cuff around her wrist, as Luise admitted Count Zalkiewski. Followed the usual inquiries, and somewhat anxious ones concerning her wounded arm, to all which-- ( Oh! suffering only from the far niente this morning," she replied, with au smile, suppressing a slight yawn.

Then bending toward him, turned over the leaves one by one. Here wis the unfinished view taken the preceding day, of the Egeri See, distant castle, and surrounding mountains. Farther on, many a wild scene, a portrait, or the care- ful copy of a masterpiece in painting or sculpture. Some -hastily executed, others finished with the ut- ,most care--all stamped with the touch and feeling of the true artist. He staid her at one page. "You have seen that?" she inquired. f"The Glacier of the Rhone! How often have I beheld the glow of sunlight on it as you have it here." "Do you remember," she asked, "Longfellow's de- scription--how he compares it to a gauntlet of ice thrown down by Winter, the mountain-king, in de- fiance of the sun, who vainly strives to raise it with his glittering spear?" He smiled, though not scoffingly, at the genuine enthusiasm in the bright glance of those violet eyes upraised to his. Somewhat pityingly, though, as the thought crossed him that longer intercourse with the world-a little longer-and she would learn how effectively art can copy nature, and how easily eyes are raised or lowered, glitter or grow dim, to the stereotyped degree of frankness or modesty, bright- ness or mistiness. - It was so long since he had seen untutored enthusiasm in French stays, that the watch- ing rather amused and interested. "Confess," he said, " was not Hyperion your guide- book thither?" She colored and hesitated, for his tone betrayed his   INGErSCO.         73 thought; but glancing up shyly into his quietly ob- servant face, replied: "I did indeed follow Paul Flemming into Inter- lachen, and traced his footsteps to the great Glacier of the Grindelwald, the Schreckenhorn, and the Jung- frau, and above all sat in the green vale of Lauter- brunnen upon the very same mossy bank whence his Mary Ashburton must have sketched the ruins of Un- spunnen."  , "Those ruins then frowned down upon another Mary Ashburton-and the magician?" She blushed a quick, guilty blush, remembering that as Harry stood beside her there, Mary's response had flashed through her mind: "You are not the magi- cian." True, the offending thought had been imme- diately and self-reproachfully banished--for did she not love Harry very, very dearly? She turned quickly over the leaves to the first page. "M y home," she said. A rugged coast, where billows dashed against pre- cipitous cliffs that, stretching far out into the sea, formed a safe harbor for the less turbulent waters, where lightly skimmed two or three fishing-boats, like white-winged sea-birds. Above the crags, grassy slopes, -shaded by clumps of grand old trees, rolled away in natural terraces to the foot of a- castle. Hea- vy, moss-grown turrets and feudal battlements were there, and, as though taken under, their protecting wing, a modern mansion, with lofty porticoes, stood modestly a little back. In the distance, a village half hidden in the foliage, the church spire with its cross rising clear against the sky. In the background, darkly wooded and rocky mountain ranges.  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7551-00000038"/> 74        INGMSCO.  "And where is this?' the Count asked, after ex. pressing due admiration. "In the Highlands of Scotland-Ross-shire.

I am a Pole, and am of course entitled to neither home nor Heimweh," he responded, somewhat bitterly. "You must have been a great wanderer," and she glanced up at him compassionately; "( and in all your wanderings, have you never been in England? You speak our language with almost no foreign accent." "I have, and in your Scotland also. I once spent a winter in Edinburgh." "In Edinburgh! Is it possible?"And she paused in her careless toying with the leaves of her book as she lounged back in the great easy-chair, and sat eagerly upright. "Then perhaps you may know- my sister who resides there-she married a Campbell." "I knew several of that name," he replied, interested; "Iet me see-there was Archie, George, Donald "Donald! Then you do know him?" 'Both your sister and her husband. Moreover, ad- vanced quite to the friendly-dinner degree of inti- macy," he rejoined, gratified by her frank gratifica- tion.

She has been for the last four or five months in Syria with her hus. band, who is engaged there upon some explorations connected with one of our Edinburgh learned socie- ties. It just suits Jeanie, you know-the roving life, the novelty, ancd the spice of romance and shade of- danger among all those wild tribes. I am not sure that I should not like it myself, although Jeanie laughs at me for being so much more staid than she, who is ten years older. I only hope she and Donald will prove as successful antiquaries as you and I were yes- terday. But when were you in Edinburgh?" "In-yes, in '36--ten years ago. Your sister was then a bride, very young, very beautiful. You do not resemble each other."' Margaret laughed gayly at this reverse of a com- pliment. "We are to meet at Baden in a few weeks," she said, "and I shall tell her of 'our romantic introduc- tion, though, by the way--for do you know you have not yet told me your name?" "Pardon me," was the rejoinder, "but the circum- stances of our meeting rendered an introduction rather superfluous at first-afterward, I forgot. As it was not my intention, however, to remain incog- nito, I wrote my name to your father. And now I am Ernst Ivar Zalkiewski, very much at your service."

"I doubt its being very accurate, Count Zalkiew- ski. Still if you really care to have it-stay, let me add a few finishing touches." She took the volume and bent over it, quite ab- sorbed in her employment. As she progressed with a few sketches of the pencil, throwing the cross in the wall into bolder relief, her lip curved with a suppressed smile, and after a moment she asked carelessly if there were nor romance nor legend connected with this very romantic, legendary spot. "I believe there is; the devil ran away with the hermit, or the hermit with the devil-it boots not which," he answered as carelessly. So, the smile yet lingering, with one nod bestowed patronizingly upon the red cross on her arm, she re- turned to her drawing. Presently she turned slightly toward him, studying his face in cool, unembarrassed artist-survey, he mean- while glancing over the volume she on his entrance had laid aside, thinking more of its title-- Flower, Fruit, and Thorn-Pieces"--than of its contents, and wondering if after all, life were one long Thrn-piece.

She was leaning from the casement of her turret- chamber, rejoicing in the sunshine and the fresh morn- ing breeze, when her father's call reached her. She looked down and saw him    standing below, upon the cloister steps. She hastened down to him.

"And now, after to-day," she added in a lighter tone, "I shall keep this habit a memento. Not that- so long as I live I could forget that day, nor the no- ble daring of Alice's Count." An expression of amusement lurked in Mr. Ross's eyes. Following them, Margaret turned.  Count Zalkiewski stood so near that he must have heard lfer last words. She returned his good-morrow with a blush that heightened yet more as he said: "Is an involuntary eavesdropper permitted to in- quire / She looked up then, meeting his eyes frankly, and interrupted: "I shall forestall your inquiries to explain your be- ing so unceremoniously appropriated.

"O  Count Zalkiewski!"' she called, her eyes fixed upon the distant shores of the lake, "is yonder vil- lage-there, across the lake, just opposite--Egeri or Ob?" "Egeri"--and he stopped short-" but, Miss Ross, if you are interested in our scenery, you have but a circumscribed view here. Were you to mount yon- der parapet,ijt-isar more extended, even more than from your tower. The Zuger See lies severel miles to the rear, and the western tower completely con- ceals it from this end of the castle. And the Righi in the distance rises through a gap in the near Alps." She sprang instantly down the steps. "Attraction upon attraction, each in itself induce- ment strong enough to storm the battlements," she exclaimed. "The rain last night, Margaret," her father sug- gested, dubiously regarding the glittering lawn. Margaret raised her dress and put out her foot. Count Zalkiewski gave her a penetrating glance. But there was no coquetry in the gay smile, no vanity in the clear, frank eyes, no consciousness that the beauty of the little foot was yet striking, although clad in boots for mountain rambles meet. At this unanswerable argument d propos de bottes, Margaret and Coint Zalkiewski crossed the lawn to where, surrounding the- western tower partly in ruins,  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7551-00000041"/> 80         INGKEM3C0. rose the massive granite rampart to the height of some twenty feet. A broad grassy parapet surmount- ed, which with the Count's assistance Margaret reached. She stood in silent delight. She looked down from a height of over fifty feet; for the wall crowned a steep, descending a rocky rampart to the road that wound along the leafy banks of the Egeri. Here the precipice was unbroken, but toward the eastern tower broad though rude steps were cut in winding ascent to the brow of the cliff, where stretch- ed an ample lawn, denuded of rocks, shaded by giant beeches, and gladdened by wildflowers innumerable. The rampart was itself picturesque. Extending from the partly ruined tower, it swept round, broken here and there, toward the castle front, and there lay crumbling away, buried beneath a living mass of ivy and lichens. Broad beneath lay the Egeri and Ob gleaming white upon the clear blue waters. Far be- hind, the Zuger See shone silvery in the distance, and heavily frowned the broad brow of the Righi. "And that is the keep, is it not?"Margaret asked, pointing to a rude square tower erected upon a crag almost in the rear of the castle. "Ay," responded the Count. "You observe there is no opening in the walls, excepting those loopholes far above the ground. Tradition says a subterranean, passage in olden time connected with the monastery; and relates how a bandit horde having desecrated the latter, penetrated, led by a traitor coward, through the secret way into the keep, last refuge of- the broth- erhood. And how, having massacred these, they w6re entombed alive within the keep by the miraculous clos- ing ofthe passage-none since then have been able to find."   INGEISCO.          81 "Horrible! But do explain how, all being buried within, their story got out?" "'Further deponent, that is, tradition, saith not. But what more probable than that their restless ghosts emerge from  those loop-holes upon a moon- light night? Spirits have no bones to jeopardize in the descent, you know." Margaret's lips parted to give Luise's more roman- tic version of the story. But a glance upon the arm yet bandaged, replaced words with smiles. "Hark," she said, " there is papa asking if we are ever'coming to breakfast. Let us go down.2 "Lead the way to the Ruined Tower, ITrsin. Mr. and Miss Ross will see that first," said the Count on rising from table. Then to his guests he added: "I have a letter which it is most important to answer by this morning's post; but if you will accept my. ser. vant as temporary cicerone, I will be with you ere you finish the inspection of the monastic cells, in which you, Miss Ross, express an interest. Ancient enough, in all conscience, and a capital place for ghost-walks, etc." Leaving the dining-hall or ancient refectory, Mr. Ross and Margaret followed their guide into a cir- cular hall around which wound the broad stone stairs. Ascending these, they gained a landing where were three doors. The central one of these the servant threw open. "My master's apartments," he explained; "but I may show this one, sir. It has never been altered." A large oblong room, in size and shape resembling the boudoir. But whereas there the nineteenth cen-  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7551-00000042"/> 82        ni3rMSCOo tury, direct from Paris, might throw herself and flounces luxuriously back upon the velvet-cushioned sofa, and with suspended crochet-needle skim over the pages of Dumas's last, and still no sense of the incongruous-this apartment might have been but yesterday the abode of venerable father abbot. The long, loophole-likelwindows of darkly-stained glass, in breadth a single narrow pane reaching almost from floor to roof, the heavy beams of which were carved in dusky figures of saints and martyrs; the high, straight-backed oaken' chairs of grotesque sculptur- ing; and oaken-paneled walls ornamented after the, same manner, pictured so vividly the days of old, that rifle and powder-flask depending from the mas- sive branching antlers of a chamois affixed to the wall, books and papers scattered upon the heavy cen- tre-table in lieu of vellum and illuminated manuscript, failed to recall Margaret's imagination, groping among the middle ages. One painting only found place upon the walls. As Margaret paused before it, the servant drew near, ex- plaining: "The battle of Ostrolenka, Miss, where my master and I fought shoulder to shoulder in the ranks for Poland." Margaret looked at him with suddenly awakened interest. He was a square-built, hard-featured man, verging apparently upon fifty. He certainly had a military air now that she observed him for the first time, and he bore upon the left temple and cheek a broad white seam, contrasting with the bronzed hue of his com- plexion. His small gray eyes twinkled with a genial   INGlEISCO.     .    83 enthusiasm, which, despite his homeliness, attracted Margaret. "Were you wounded in that battle?" she inquired. "This scar," passing his hand over it, ' is the least, I was struck down, and unable to crawl out of the path of .the trampling horse of Russia. I must have perished miserably there, but that my master placed me on his own horse, and fought my way and his through the enemy. How the sabres clashed around us! What a life-long time it seemed, though the distance was but short, while he supported me, help- less, through the mortal struggle, over the dead and the dying! And he had never seen me before that day, although I was his own serf; but he nor I knew that then." "And then?"Margaret said, her eyes glistening and her cheek glowing. "And then, Miss, he cared for me gently as a woman might, and after thre surrender of Warsaw took me with him to Munich. And for a weary year, I lying perfectly helpless with my wounds and after- ward a long dangerous fever, he worked for me. Many's the meal I have seen him refuse with a smile, that there lhight be enough for me as I grew better. And many's the night I've watched the light shining under his room-door till it burned dim in the dawn, and he painting or writing to feed me." A suspicious moisture glittered on his swarthy cheek, but he brushed it away hastily, as Margaret looked at him. "Afterward"--he recommenced. e "Stay, my good fellow," interrupted Mr.' Ross good-humoredly; "it is not quite discreet to tell so  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7551-00000043"/> 84       ' INGXSCO. much of your master's history, even though you have so just reason to be proud of it." "I take it kindly in you, sir," the man replied, some. what abashed. "It is so seldom I can talk of him; for the people hereabouts have a pack of lies like the tough knots in their blockheads. I'd have hammered them into shape long ago, the fools! only my master would not let me. I hope you'll excuse me, sir." The narrow, dismal, intricate monastic cells ex- plored, they descended again to the refectory, where Count Zalkiewski joined them. "I was beginning to think, Miss Ross," he said, "that you had found the secret passage to the keep, and, abjuring less ethereal associates, determined to remain there." "Indeed," she answered, "if I could but have met with such success, I would truly not vouch for a speedy return. That visit must, I fear, be postponed indefinitely. Whither away now?" "To the chapel, if you will, and thence to the li- brary. The other tower is not worth visiting, being much modernized, as you have partly seen." He opened, as he spoke, a side-door opposite that they had entered from: the tower. It led into an oc- tagonal apartment, the arched and ground roof of which was supported by light and elegant granite columns. Paintings filled the walls; a few choice statuettes occupied the niches. Exquisite Madonnas were there, Magdalens, and many a gem far-famed. Pictured legends, simple home-scenes, many a sublime and lovely landscape. But among these last were few more beautiful than that which lay extended beneath the windows, Margaret said,' as they passed on.   INGEIISCO.         85 "Beautiful as your own Scottish home?" the Count asked. "Oh! no, no. Nowhere on earth could be that to me. Because, you know, I look at that through a long vista of happy days, and their brightness lightens the dark shades and softens the gray sternness of that rugged coast." The Count turned rather abruptly, opening the door into the chapel. Margaret suppressed, as she entered, the exclamation of delighted surprise that rose to her lips. The building, although not very spacious, yet ap- peared so, so perfect were the proportions. The lofty Gothic arches, slight and graceful, supporting the vaulted oaken roof, formed three aisles,' of which the central rose loftiest. Beyond, where sunbeams stream- ed softened through the Gothic painted windows, oc- cupying this entire end, was the pure white marble, altar within the oaken chancel. Legends were carved upon the rich wood of the paneled walls, and cheru- bim and seraphim upon the arches, with here and there an elevated marble shrine. Even the tesselated pavement harmonized with the "dim religious, light" subduing all. Next came, in form, the counterpart of the picture- gallery, a conservatory, a perfect bower of loveliest vines and flowers. Adjoining this, and divided from it merely by heavy silken curtains, usually looped back, the library. A spacious apartment, with a view back, over the ruined parapet, of the mountains, and in front looking through the dim cloisters out upon the lake. The roof was an arched skylight of stained glass, each small lozenge-shaped pane set in a frame of lead.

Well-stored book-shelves, with heavy curtains looped back, ranged along either side of the room, and now and then a valuable engraving. Graceful writing-tables, luxurious easy-chairs and so- fas, and a handsome organ, completed the furniture. + "Here, at least," Margaret exclaimed, throwing her- self into a large chair, " the ghosts never dare intrude. They would fancy themselves in the luxurious Baby- lon of old, those good old fathers." "And yet," the Count replied, "it is in the mys- terious tones of that organ that they sometimes wail by night, as the neighboring peasants have it. When I came into possession, the cells-for into these was this apartment divided and subdivided-were fallen greatly into decay, which induced me to clear all away, and to imitate in the repairs the plan of the re- fectory. And you perceive there is little deviation from it, excepting in the glazed walls at either end." "What a comfort it must be to the monks, if ever unseen they wander here, that their old familiar haunts have fallen into the hands of no reckless innovator, votary of gilding and gay paint, who would have moeked this simple majesty with gaudy decorations, like mad Lear's grand gray head bedizened with flaunting weeds." "You foolish child," her father -said, smiling at her grave look. "What do you suppose the monks would care now?" "Wouldn't I care? Why, sir, I'd haunt you with all manner of -horrors if you had the hardihood to   INGEMSCO.         87 tamper with my turret at home. There would be two dark ladyes on the north terrace then.

Would you imagine, papa," she exclaimed, looking at her watch, " it is almost one? We must have breakfasted unconscionably late; but we should not forget the earlier hours of Lowerz, if we would be in time for dinner." A few moments found the three at the foot of the winding descent from the castle cliff, where horses had long been in readiness. "May I not ride the black?" besought Margaret of the Count, as he motioned to Ursin,who held by the bridle a handsome bay. "'Certainly, if you prefer it. But I must warn you, Mademoiselle, he is very unmanageable." "I would wager Margaret could manage a Buceph- alus," Mr. Ross remarked. "But "Indeed, I would like it so much," she said, "that is," and she hesitated, embarrassed, "if you demur merely because of my safety." "That is all, believe me. I entreat " Margaret laughed, aid called to Ursin, -who had already changed the saddles. No sooner had she taken her seat than the animal, indignant at the idea of submission to so small a hand  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7551-00000045"/> 88        INi mMTsCO. as that upon his bridle, reared violently, and bounded off down the road. "She will conquer him, no fear," Mr. Ross said in reply to the anxious glance of the Count, as they fol- lowed at a slower pace. "Brav! Brav!" admiringly exclaimed the watching' Ursin as the gentlemen now overtook her, waiting be- neath a road-side tree, flushed and bright with the exercise and the triumph. "Ostrolenka was scarcely more amazed than I, at your speedy success," Count Zalkiewski remarked, as side by side they rode on. "Your horse is named Ostrolenka, then? Poor fellow!" and she patted his graceful neck; "I fancy he hangs his head somewhat in mortification; I con- fess, Count Zalkiewski, to some pride in my victory. Papa, my instructor, boasts of the horsewoman he has made, but my heart misgave me when at first I felt the strong spirit of the beautiful creature. Why have you called him Ostrolenka? Did you ride him in that battle?" Count Zalkiewski turned his eyes upon her in sur- prise. "Your servant," she hastened to explain, "gave us this morning some account of the battle, called forth by a picture." "I hope the old man did not weary you? He has but one weakness, fidelity toward his country and his master. But I think you must have borne with him, judging from his exultation but now when Os- trolenka yielded you the victory." "O Count Zalkiewski! Surely you can never mean one can be too faithful."   INGEMSCO.        89 "Too faithful, Mademoiselle, because fidelity is little deserved, little valued. Too faithful, because the in- constant are still the happiest in this changeful world." The dark lashes drooped sadly over her great, ear- nest eyes, and she made no reply. "Your Fidelis," Mr. Ross said, coming to her res- cue, "pictured a scene upon that battle-field which renders me the prouder that it is to Count Zalkiewski I owe the priceless boon of my daughter's life." The Count's bow was given to the father, but his eyes sought the daughter's questioningly. The quick uplifting of those drooping lashes, heavy with tears not to be shed, was all the answer needful. "But, Margaret," said her father, "what grand mistake did I hear you make just now? Either you are woefully at fault in dates, or you imagine this animal to have been a war-horse fifteen years ago." She laughed. "Since I must plead guilty to the one or the other, I choose the former. And now if you do not exchange our quiet walk for a more ani- mated pace, we will never reach Lowerz." Lowerz was reached, however. The sound of min- gled voices and laughter discovered the gay group in the garden, before the low-branched trees and shrub- bery disclosed them. Mrs. Ross was seated there be- neath the shade where flickering lights from the laden rose-vine in the maple overhead threw a tinge of reflected color upon her pallid cheek, and touched into warmth the smooth bands of her pale brown hair. Beneath the maples also Alice stood. Her cheek need- ed no reflected tint, the glowing roses were not  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7551-00000046"/> 90         INoTGrWCO.  brighter as she stood there, the soft tresses blown from her brow, the uplifted arms gleaming fair as marble from the falling sleeves of her blue muslin, her slight figure swaying to and fro as she caught or flung the grace-hoops to her antagonist, Count Fal- kenstein. Mr. More lounged near, counting the scores and making himself useful in the mirth-pro- voking way. "F Where is Harry?"Margaret inquired, looking round for him when she had been clasped in the long, close embrace of her mother, and received Alice's eager kisses. "Why, he -has missed you after all! For once he grew impatient, and set off to meet you, though I told him he could not know which way you would come. But Margaret, you schemer," Alice whispered, as to- gether the sisters moved from the gate; " one thing I know, your whole adventure was a plot against my wager."             ' "'The best-laid plans o' mice and men Gang aft agley!" quoted Margaret; "for, mark you, unhappy Alice, your Count has requested me to make use of yonder coveted steed until papa can procure another." A silken rustle from the adjacent arbor, only hid- den by its vines, and a fairy figure, fresh and bright, with dark braids pushed carelessly back from the brow, one rounded cheek flushed with the pressure of a rosy palm, and two eyes only half open in the sud- den glare of light, flitted out and up to Margaret, still rubbing her eyes with the air of a sleepy child. "Ciel 1" she cried, embracing her rapturously, "how   IrGEMSco.          91 I could oversleep myself there on that hard bench and you here, chere Marguerite! Mille pardons!" Margaret turned to introduce her to the Polish Count. She called his name as he stood in conversa- tion with Alice. The Baroness bestowed upon him a most graceful bow, which. surely deserved a ready return. But when his eyes first fll upon her, he started, his stern face lighted up strangely and tenderly; and involun- tarily, perhaps unconsciously, he muttered: "It is, it must be, I will speak to her. But no- better to wait."' -And very quietly he returned her unconscious bow. Unconscious, Margaret, watching keenly, saw. For she had partly heard his muttered words. But only an instant could she note his whole attention concen- trated with absorbing interest on the Baroness, ere Alice called: "Such a charming plan we have arranged, Mar- garet! Mr. More, you are appointed recruiting offi- cer for our company. Exert your utmost eloquence and enlist every one." Thus adjured, with an iemphatic Oyez, he proceeded to explain that Miss Alice and he, with his able young adjutant, Count Falkenstein, had resolved on attack- ing by moonlight the ruins of Schaaaau, realm of di- vers ghosts, witches, and hobgoblins. And whereas the highway to that reverend castle, situate on an island by the same name, is, after mature deliberation, duly concurred in by aforesaid adjutant, deemed in- secure for foot-passengers-therefore, resolved"-point- ing to a gayly-striped skiff moored to the bank below --"that there be procured this specimen of -the fine  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7551-00000047"/> 92         nrGmasco. arts so resembling a gorgeous rainbow, which shall  transport safely as Mohammed's rainbow the faithful to the shores of the Happy Isle. Wherefore this pre- sent company is invited to convene sine die, but with eventide, to the even tide of yonder lake. "Perfect," applauded Margaret-then to Zalkiew- ski "And you, Count, will surely not desert us?" Standing there at her side with folded arms and eyes bent on the ground, so absorbed was he that she had to repeat her words. He raised his head then, with a quick-flashing glance from herself to the Bar- oness, who now chatted with her brother, her hand lightly laid on his. Margaret heard Zalkiewsi sigh heavily. "I ask it as a special favor-we must have you," she said, thinking compassionately of his dreary life day after day, and of the contrast with that which he had given her back.* - Then I go." Quiet voice and manner all un- readable. "Thank you," she replied simply. Count Falkenstein, standing near, reddened angrily, and as Margaret turned carelessly away, and passing himn on her way to the cottage made some allusion to the party, he answered shortly that he was not going. She raised her eyes and gave him a sweeping glance. She perceived his anger, but not being able to divine the cause, chose not to notice it. "Oh! I thought you were," she said very coolly, and was passing on, when he placed himself in her path. You do not care?" he asked, in smothered tones.   INGTEMSXOO.        93 "In faith, not I, if you -do not wish to go," she re- plied, looking at him in perplexity. "Yet you have asked Count Zalkiewski, actually requested him as a favor to yourself," he began vehe- mently. "Sir," she interrupted, while the' color surged to  her very brow. "How and by what right you venture thus to speak to me, I am at a loss to imagine." Recalled to himself by her manner yet more than her words, he stammered something-what, she did aot understand, but understanding that it was meant for an apology, the fire died out in her eyes, and she smiled as she said she was quite willing to forget. "And will you ask me to come?" That I won't, Herr von Blodigkeit. Consult your Dwn sweet will, and adieu or au revoir, as you see fit to make it." And waving her hand gayly she flitted past him nto the cottage.  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7551-00000048"/> VI.

The rainbow, transgressing all rules of Nature's ap- pointment, made its appearance even at this twilight   i hour, and it was not long ere each had taken his or her place therein. Margaret smiled as Count Falkenstein came for- ward and claimed his at her side in the bow. "Actually?" she exclaimed. "Can it be that you have indeed decided in our favor, and resolved to forego the well-nigh irresistible charms of the Low- erz Hostelrie?  The Count-worship of Mein Herr Host, the blandishments of the worthy Hausmeisterin, and-ah Monsieur!-the sunset beechen grove and its bewitching little French dryad?" He looked  annoyed.  "That dryad, bewitching  though she be," he said, "is better fitted to haunt the shades of the Champs Elysees than the rugged cliffs of   INGMSCO.         95 Switzerland. For these, Mademoiselle, one seeks a mountain nymph." His bow designated the nymph in question, and with a laughing reverence she appropriated the com- pliment. "Endeavoring to propitiate the offended nymph?" she said. "But you should reserve your compli- ments for a season of more urgent need, the fair dryad herself being fair excuse for occasional desertions from the Scottish Thistle to the Fleur-de-lis-the more especially as the thistle is wont to prick upon occasion. By the by, how is it that with the most amicable intentions in the world, we are so very apt to quarrel?" His brow clouded, but anon he answered laugh- ingly: "Have you not a proverb, Mademoiselle, warning against the pain of touching lightly the armed thistle? It may be I strive so to grasp that the sting may be harmless. Strive, I say-for, weh mir, too often am I nettled." "Vive the Carduus Benedictus!" and she tossed handkerchief in air. 'And let me assure you that this evening all the nettles are left behind." "But I like the nettles best," he replied, with some seriousness; "for the nettles stay, and one learns after a time where to find them, and in what path to step upstung. ' But the down flies here, there, and everywhere, and, even if caught, is so passive. Like you, Mademoiselle, in some of your amiable moods. With me at least."

Margaret was pondering over his start, and long strange gaze on  their introduction, when an impatient movement from her companion struck her attention, and she turned. His brow was clouded, his very attitude restless, and his eyes too, bent half angrily upon the party in the stern, whence she now observed Alice's ringing laugh- ter as Mr. More spoke to her. A short fierce sigh escaped Falkenstein. Margaret's sympathies were touched, and she began to say something, any thing, to withdraw his attention from that flirtation to which she thought she traced the sigh, She did not clearly know what she said in her embarrassment, which was certainly not diminished by his turning full upon her, asserting confidently: "You are pitying me." "I--I , " "You shall not scorn. I will keep my manhood, I will endure, even though I may be madly--most madly-in love. Mademoiselle, must it be madly? Have I no hope?" She had not raised her eyes in her confusion, and she did not see the gaze which might have told her it was not as mediatrix that he looked to her. She only replied to the smothered passion of his voice, while her own sank low, and her color deepened- "I do, not know-I can not tell. In time, who knows   " Her hand rested upon the bench beside his own. He grasped it, wringing it so violently as he released,   INGEMSCO.         97 that the imprints of the rings was left upon the deli- cate fingers. At that moment the oarsmen drew in their oars, and the boat glided into the harbor formed by massive overhanging rocks. With an effort Margaret shook off her depression, and merrily the party, Count Falkenstein the mer- riest there, traversed the dusky grove and scaled the moonlit cliffs, until at last was gained the ruined por- tal of Castle Schaanau. Upon a lofty promontory it was built, grim sha- dows thrown by tower and battlement troubling like shades of the past the serenity of the silvery waters to-night. A weird, tottering old maple tossed its withered boughs soughing athwart the entrance; and as Margaret sprang forward and parted them, stand- ing upon the threshold, bats, their realm of darkness invaded by the visitors' flickering torch, fluttered against the damp and mouldering walls, and a ban- ished owl set up his lamentation from a ledge near by. The visitors paused at length within the spacious banquet-hall, where heavy supporting columns of gray stone multiplied themselves in the dim recesses into myriad ghastly forms, as it were those of former banqueters, Margaret said to Count Zalkiewski, who stood beside her. "A haunted chamber, truly, and bloody is its his- tory," was his response. She shrank nearer, to his side, with a startled glance around. But immediately she laughed, and said half ashamed: "That was only my Scottish faith in the mysteri- ous, taken by surprise.

"My Lord, and ladies and gentlemen of the jury," he began, with a preliminary reverence first to Mr. Ross and then to the company who had taken their seats upon the parapet, with the exception of Count Falkenstein who remained standing moodily apart, "we plead guilty to the charge, confess our high crime and misdemeanor, and have now only to throw ourselves upon your gracious clemency, trusting that you make due allowance for the well-known weakness of woman and remember the irresistible attraction exercised by her over the gallant sons of Adam, caus- ing them, by following in her footsteps, to plunge into all manner of follies." "No, pardon, my Lord Judge. The prisoner de- serves to be committed rather for contempt of court,? cried Margaret. "And the punishment? since it is not to be banish- ment to Lo  "' Mrs. Ross ended abruptly. "A Saul among the prophets!" laughed Harry May. "What say you to a song, Cousin Maude?"

During the moment's consideration, Margaret's glance sought Count Falkenstein. As his eyes met hers gloomily, she rose, following a sudden impulse, and went to him, saying softly: . "Will you not join us, Count?     Nay, you have not pronounced the forbidden words, and may not be banished from our charmed circle." The shade passed from his brow, and when she re- turned and took possession of a mossy stone, he fol- lowed uand stood leaning against the debris which formed a low back to her seat. Order being restored, Mr. More took the floor. '"I pray your pardon for any trifling Hibernicism that may occur in my song," he remarked by way of preface, " not that there is aught Hibernian about me, by no means.   The song is one of a college chum. You remember Charlie Sheridan, Falkenstein?     Now you must all join in the chorus. Miss Alice, I rely upon you."- And he startled the Swiss echoes, thus: Ay, the bards of the ancients were very great poets, With their arma virumque, and all such ado; But we of the moderns are never so ghostly As to sing to dead men and their rusty arms too.

Chorus and   consequent applause dying   away, Fal- kenstein asked: n        INGEMSCO.          103 "Who was this Venus Of Sheridan's, More?      I should have deemed arma virumque far more in the style of the misogynist Sheridan." "Poor Charlie! It was disappointment made him cynical. His Venus, and I believe his first, certainly his last love, was little Rose Geraghty, ' Erin's White Rose in Killarney,' so the line originally ran. The gipsy jilted him for--me-and shall I confess it?- me for a cousin of hers. But Sheridan, instead of drawing out the Rose's mischievous thorn with one groan and no more for its sharpness, has left it rank- ling still. Don't you think," he ended in a lower tone to Alice, "that flirtations should be classified premeditated murder, and punished accordingly?" "Of course. Always provided a clear case of felo- de-se be not made out. These poor victims, it is to be feared, too often immolate themselves upon the shrine of their own vanity, instead of being sacrificed to a woman's." "But Mademoiselle must not defraud us of her legend," reminded Falkenstein. "Well then, as poetry is d la mode -to-night, my legend is in verse: Hark! the raven flaps his wing In the briered dell below.

And each fearful ripple lags Ere 't upon the shore doth break. Margaret started, and her lips parted as if to speak.  She leaned forward, but Alice was sheltered behind the broad shoulders of Harry May.     Then checking herself she sank back, her hands trembling at first as absently she twisted together the fiinges of her shawl. "You   are cold, Mademoiselle," Falkenstein     said, stooping  to assist her in arranging the shawl more closely about her shoulders. She thanked   him with a smile, while Alice contin  ued: Calm the Righi stands, and proud, Sunset halo round her head; Drear Pilatus wrapt in shroud- Shroud deep-stained, a gory red.  Nevermore the lake knows rest, Still the darkened waters plain, Waving reeds upon its breast Rusted to a crimson stain. And they beckon, beckon slow-- And they murmur, pointing down- Deep and swift the waters flow, Some dread memory to drown. Far, far down within the deeps, There he lies-the waves shrink back- Not anear the sea-worm creeps-- 'Neath his head the weeds are black.

"'Who knows?"Alice replied to the demand for the author's name. "I found it on the pavement in the banquet-hall, scribbled upon a slip of paper which I picked up, supposing it to have been dropped for me by some literary ghost." "Do you positively aver that it is not your own?" questioned Falkenstein. "I do, and summon Mr. More as witness. Why, my greatest attainment in the poetical line was a certain couplet on Harry, rhymed after an hour's in- tense study, and much in the vein of 'hey diddle did- dle.' Do you remember Margaret?" "Eureka!" cried Harry, suddenly confronting Mar- garet, who finding .herself discovered shrank back and playfully put her hands before her face. "So it was to drown this poor wretch up there, that only the other day you were asking me so many questions about Mount Pilatus. I told you next to nothing, so how did you find your ' briered dell?"' - "I did not find it," Margaret answered; "but those lines of Chatterton haunted me, and you know there is really a tradition of Pilate's drowning himself on Mount Pilatus. I am curious to know whether there may not be a briered dell." "Why not undertake, an exploration?"Falkenstein suggested. "The very thing!" "Charmant!" exclaimed Mr. More and the Baroness in a breath.   And Alice clapped her hands, bowing low in gratitude to the suggestor, ere turning to her mother. "Mamma, you are quite strong now, Why should  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7551-00000054"/> 106        INTGRTSCO. we not go to-morrow?"Then, as her mother smiled and nodded, she continued eagerly, appealing to her father:       . "Can we not go, papa? Will you arrange it?" "How would a lengthened excursion do--Pilatus, the Righi, Luzern, all the lions?" The plan being unanimously approved, Lowerz was released from ban, that late hours to-night should not prevent an early start upon the morrow.   VII .

And faces no less-bright greet the sun as he rises above the far-crowned heights closing in the eastern horizon. Bustle predominates, here a basket, ,there a cushion or long-sought shawl, borne triumphantly aloft by hurrying servants until safely stowed away in the carriage where Mr. and Mrs, Ross, the Baroness and Mr. More, composing the lazy list, form a lively quartette, while the horses, snuffing the morning breeze, paw the ground, impa- tient to be off. They are off at last, and Margaret, until now in- dolently leaning upon the gate, wreathing and twist ing around her hat a handful of silvery immortelles, and as indolently hearing without joining in the con- versation between Alice and the attendant gentle- men, starts up, crying with a but half-suppressed yawn:         - "To horse, to horse! or we shall inevitably wan- der off into the Land of Nod, oblivious of the Righi.  2  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7551-00000055"/> 108        INGEMSCO. Now for a glorious race to awaken us all. Allons! Who wins?" And mounted on Ostrolenka she looks back, waving her little gloved hand in defiant challenge. All Lowerz is awake, and many a cottage doorway filled with the voluminous proportions of the matron, inquisitively shading her eyes from the strengthen- ing sunbeams with broad brown hand, and ready to bestow smile and nod upon the passing cavalcade. From many a cottage doorstep, too, glance up de- mure little rosy maidens from their knitting or net- ting, or pause in combing the great yellow-brown hanks of spun silk which hang in festoons against window-frames and doorways, bringing from the sunny vales of Italy occupation and bread to many an Alpine home. Now a merry-faced urchin, first setting down with careful hands the precious wooden bowl of dark bread and milk, rushes frantically out into the middle of the road, waving aloft a ragged apology for a hat, and receiving in return smiling recognition from the departing tourists. For this ex- pedition en masse seems a final leave-taking to the- good Lowerzers, many of whom have been taught by word and deed truly to value truly the Scottish strangers. And now is neared the Zuger See. Margaret gazes with interest upon the wooded heights mirroring themselves far below in the blue waters; for there, saith history, stood Tell, and sped the arrow which pierced the tyrant heart of Gessler. And Art is passed, and Kfissnacht gained. Here ,at the foot of the great Righi the carriage party mount their horses for the ascent. The gay, the sometimes dangerous, the always wondrously beau-   INGEMSCO.         109 tifal ascent! The wild defiles, the fearful ravines, the distant glimpse of glittering lake or blossoming valley, the darksome forest arches, opening like avenues of fairyland, the grand, the glorious Kulm, mist-encircled, towering up on cloudy pinnacle, to heaven! Then the long and welcome rest at noon, beneath those mighty pines on a carpeting of many-colored mosses, beside the gurgling rivulet where golden buttercups and dew-bright blossoms of the blue gen- tian write for us upon the turf home-letters of child- hood's haunts and  childhood's dreams, while the glowing Alpenrosen, swaying in their rocky foot- holds, hint of the rosy, unaccustomed present. And the pilgrimage to the shrine of ' our Lady of the Snow,' down in a green hollow below the Kulm- where the reverend priest who has just been officiat- ing tells how three brothers from the nearest convent remain in these deep solitudes the winter long, cheered by no mortal presence excepting when occasionally the peasant proprietor of one of the mountain perches between earth and heaven, veritable cottages, if not castles, in the air-fastens on his crampons, and thith- er climbs-his way.  Then is the silence unbroken save by the distant passing of a mountain sledge, laden with wood and guided down the steep path- ways by stalwart peasant or mayhap a maiden, the sledger's cheery shout and song awakening the for- est which man and beast and bird have so long left in slumber. The sunset glow is in the air, and its glory rests upon the Righi.  Solitude remained below, in the woodland recesses. Here is a motley multitude as- &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7551-00000056"/> 1].0        ING^MISCO. sembled. In the background, with the indispensable accompaniments of stables, stable-boys, din and bus- tle, stands the inn, about the doors and balconies of which lounge guides variously engaged in eating, drinking, smoking, and gossiping, while from a window in marvelous proximity to the pointed, over- hanging roof, leans a bonny maiden, carrying on, as she airs her blankets and her linen, a stealthy flirta- tion with a gallant below, who sports the black lea- ther small-clothes and white stockings, the scarlet vest and long blue open jacket, of Schwyz. In the fore- ground are groups of every description and of al- most every country. Here a Russian princess with her noble retinue discourses in astounding consonants. There a knot of German students in gay pedestrian garb, personating in appearance every phase of char- acter, from the fierce bandit Don Whiskerado to the fair-haired, mild-eyed poet or musician. A Tyrolese -peddler, chamois-booted, his grave, clear-cut features looking national beneath the shade of the national black-cock plume, displays his wealth of beauty to a circle of admiring country-people. Here a family of English exclusives, in the well-to-do, over-dressed shopkeeper style, upon the approach of our party turn the significant shoulder. Here, there, and every- where, the ubiquitous Yankee, "doing" the Alps, striding about, a very lord of creation, ejecting his tobacco-juice and his opinions with the same deter- mination, equally careless whether in or out of place, and not to be daunted by the repeated rebuffs of the English exclusives, whom he leaves at last with the query, addressed with insinuating politeness to the red-headed dandy of the party:   XNGEMSCO.         1l "I say, stranger, did, you have any kin-folks mixed up in the Revolution? Because in our picture of the battle of Lexington up to hum, there's a red-coat a streaking it before our bayonets, the living image of your grandfather." Upon which information concerning the family tree, the dandy discontinues his employment of switching at the turf blossoms with his -cane, raises his head and stares in astonishment through a piece of glass stuck in his eye, then saunters contemptuously away. To all this our travelers give but passing attention, the glorious scenery claiming all their regard. The whole heavens are glowing in their crimson and gold, and as a blood-red streak wavers from denser clouds down over the Pilatus, standing up distinct and iso- lated in its gloom against the bright skies, Margaret thinks of the legend, and the cloud rises there, a bloody witness over the grave of the blood-stained soul whom neither the water which he vainly defiled in the judgment-hall, nor the waters of the lake where tradition holds he strove to find repose, could purify. Northward Lake Zurich glimmers faint as moonlight. Red and seared as though but lately scarred with its stupendous slide of earth, arises the Rossberg, throw- ing the shadow of its own melancholy over the bloom- ing valley of Lowerz. Mythen is vailed in amber mists-lakes, rivers, villages, fade in the deepening twi- light; and afar retreat the mountains in Uri, until they are blending with shadows in'the valley of the Reuss. And ere many hours, mountains, lakes, valleys, scenes and visions of the past, the present, and the future, are all blending in the indistinct shadowland of dreams. *  b \ -    /  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7551-00000057"/> "2        'INrGEHSCOd   , Dispelling the shadows comes the early dawn, and with it a long, shrill, echoing blast ofherdsman's horn, arousing -the dreamers to the reality that the herald trumpeter of Dan Phebus has announced his approach, and that whoso would behold his glorious advent must be "Up and doing, With a heart for any fate," to which those are liable who brave the difficulties of a toilet in the dark, and of blind gropings down lad der-like stairs, and through unfamiliar turns and pas sages.

Presently through the hush is heard the rustling of the morning breeze among the far-off pines. Slowly beneath the silvery mists the rosy flushes deepen. The floating clouds turn toward earth their golden linings-the golden portals of the east unfold--and the fiery chariot passes through. Afar, gleam and glisten snowy Alps.

For it is day upon the Righi. And now the differ- ent groups disperse, hurrying back to the inn; some suddenly aware, under the increasing light upon the subject, of the unbecomingness of their attire; some yawning and casting around sleepy and discontented glances; some shivering, pinched and blue in the frosty atmosphere; others moving on with firm step and complacent air, as conscious of a duty duly per- formed, albeit a somewhat painful one. Guides are lounging in the faint sunshine, looking on with un- concerned familiarity; cattle low in the green pas- tures below; stable-boys are lazily beginning their accustomed avocations. From the inn issues now an appetizing odor, and mistress and maid are hurrying to and fro, bearing to the unpretending board great bowls of goat's milk- and of the country-made wine, and steaming wooden trenchers of oatmeal porridge, roast potatoes and toasted cheese, with accompani- ments of stewed fruits. It was long past mid-day when our travelers made the first long pause in their rambling descent of the mountain in a direction opposite to that of the KfEss- nacht ascent. There, down in a romantic glen-a very Sleepy Hollow, inclosed by rocky bastions, battlements, and towers-gushed forth the "Fountain of the Sis- ters." A Sleepy Hollow Nature destined it to be, reposing beneath the guardianship of giant cliffs and soothed by the low plash of the waters. But intru- sive man willed otherwise, and conspired with fame to convert these cold springs into miraculous baths. Thus the echoes were wide awake when our party  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7551-00000058"/> "4         INGEMSCO. descended and mingled with others straying among the rocks, grouped beneath the magnificent beeches, or watching the immersion of three or four credulous experimentalists, who, according to the oracles, must plunge in in full attire, and afterward act as their own drying-lines. Wandering from her own circle, Margaret joined the spectators at this ceremony, and stood quietly ob- servant of passing scenes and people. Among the latter, two presently riveted her attention. They came leisurely strolling up a-mossy bank, kept, by the moist influence of the waters beneath, more vivid- ly green tn t the surrounding slopes. There they stopped, the stout, middle-aged gentleman and the plump, little English-looking girl, whose prettiness was fresh and blooming as the Alpenrosen in her shadowing hat. Her hand, loosely clasping a clus- ter of wild flowers, rested on his arm, her bright blue eyes were raised to his, and the full lips parted in a merry laugh as she listened; while Margaret, who was too distant to hear, caught herself involuntarily smiling-his manner, and the quiet twinkle of his keen gray eyes were so fraught with dry humor. Now the girl leaned forward, splashing with her riding-whip in the water, and furthering on its down- ward journey a paper boat launched by a child above. As she raised herself again, casting a careless glance around, the color rushed into her face, and to Mar- garet's amazement she precipitately dropped whip and flowers, and quitting her companion's arm without a word, vanished in the crowd. He turned, astonish- ed, to look in the direction she had disappeared, but presently relinquished the vain quest, apparently re-   INGrMTSCO.        115 conciling himself to the loss with some reflection mut- tered in an undertone. Margaret, a moment after, seized the clue to the flight, in the approach of the very Yankee whose stolid imperturbability had so amused her the evening before. She was watching with no little wonder the gentleman's markedly courteous reception of him, when she heard close at hand the rustling of a dress, and looking round, discovered the little runaway, evidently using her as a screen. Their eyes met, and Margaret could not forbear a smile, while the young lady laughed outright, saying half inquiringly: "So you saw my maneuver? Oh! I was so afraidc that horrid man would find me out!" "Why do you not send him 'away?"Margaret asked, amused by the earnest tones. "Send him away! Oh! I never know hdw to do any thing of that kind. And besides, unfortunately, he saved my life yesterday, and my uncle won't hear of my being rude to him. He thinks me shockingly ungrateful as it is." "And is it not somewhat so to speak of his having unfortunately saved your life?" "Perhaps-but I do not think you would say so if you knew how it all came to pass. ' You see," she continued, dropping on the rocks at Margaret's feet, her eager, upturned face assisting in her explanation, "Iast evening I was straying about on the mountain- top, gathering flowers, whlen I espied the prettiest tuft of moss imaginable, growing midway down a. long green slope, at the foot of which was a deep ra- vine, it is true, but so far off that I did not dream of any danger.

But no sooner  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7551-00000059"/> i 16        S'.W PMTSCO., had I taken a few steps than I began sliding, sliding down the slippery turf, and would certainly have slid straight on over the precipice, if it had not been for this creature. But only think how he rescued me," she went on, in a tone between laughing and crying with vexation. C"As I was slipping along, past the rock on which he was sitting cross-legged-I was too frightened to see even the rock then, but I had no- ticed him before-he poked out one long leg attached to a foot almost as large as the rock he was holding on by. You may be sure I clutched it without ex. amining too closely into appearances. My uncle says he has heard Nature requires nine tailors to make one man, but never-before saw her patent requiring three feet to make one. Now just imagine my feelings when, after being slowly drawn up, and safely de- posited on the rocks-my screams had drawn, I don't know how many witnesses there-I relinquished my hold on the whole calf's skin, I am convinced it was, which I had been clasping so passionately in my arms." Merry laughter, in which Margaret joined, inter- rupted her words. "Of course, the first silly thing I did was to cry heartily with vexation, and right there before every body too. And, of course, my adventure-I always wanted to have an Alpine adventure-over, went for nothing, for who ever heard of a heroine and a calf- skin? And then when it was taken away, to behave as if she were crying for it like a baby I Moreover, quite to do away with any sentiment which the calf- skin might have -inspired, I have my suspicions that its owner was fully aware of the consequences of botanizing on that slope, and would not warn me for   INGEMSCO         117 the express purpose of making a hero of himself, with not the least danger either to himself -or me. For from the position, there could be no doubt of his power to rescue me.  I might have saved myself perhaps; only when I am frightened, every thing is in a whirl before me--I can not think. I observed him looking after me with a very peculiar smile as I turn- ed off from the rocks. But I dare not insist upon this to my uncle, with whom the Yankee trick has succeeded perfectly." Just then Harry made his appearance, looking anxiously round in search of Margaret. She called to him, and gayly explained the difficulties of the dis- tressed damsel. He entered into them gallantly, as errant knight befitted, and offered a safe retreat and a merry party, if she would accompany Miss Ross and engage him- self as future screen. "And Mr. May will inform your uncle of the where- abouts of his runaway niece," Margaret suggested. "Not for worlds!" hastily interposed the niece. "You have not, like me, been taught Yankee perti- nacity by direr'experience. I should never escape him the second time. Besides, my uncle knows me too well to be surprised or alarmed at any vagrancy of mine, or of my sex, as he declares. But I have not intro- duced myself all this time. My name is Rose Lynde; my uncle's Robert Lynde, of Lyndehurst, Lancashire, where I have lived with him in his old bachelor's hall ever since I was a very little girl. Now let us go, if you please, for I see that creature shifting him- self from side to side as if preparatory to a move."

The various groups had begun to disperse, when lo! rapidly bearing down upon ours, like a  gaunt tall-' masted sloop under full sail from his own native fish- ing-village, the dreaded Yankee came.  Miss Lynde uttered a faint cry, and laughingly pushed Margaret before her. But the sharp Yankee proved, to use his own familiar phraseology, one too many for her that time. He saw her, and called out: "Uncle looking for you, Miss.  It's getting late, and I calculate it's about time you was moving." "The young lady goes with me to her uncle," re- plied Harry, to whom Rose's eyes appealed. "Oh!" she whispered to Margaret, " if I could but give him a sly push and send him flying from that ledge, down into the water, I think I could endure him for a week to come." Meanwhile the Yankee, piqued out of his accus- tomed coolness, inquired if Harry was Miss Lynde, or claimed to be, a gentleman,? It was Miss Lynde he was speaking to. Harry made a hasty forward movement, his inter- rogator made as hasty a  retrograde one, and as the fates would have it, accident speedily accomplished Miss Lynde's wish. The unlucky Yankee, after per- forming a series of desperate somersaults, plunged headlong into the fountain below. "Now is your time to be quits and play heroine by rescuing your Adonis," Margaret, as soon as she could restrain her mirth, said to Miss Lynde.   INGEMSCO.         119 But Miss Lynde only shook her head, asserting her incapacity for the r6le, while tears coursed down her cheeks as though she were lamenting instead of laughing over the fate of Brother Jonathan, who presently, nothing disconcerted, reappeared dripping like a Triton, amid unsuppressed hilarity. That pesky bath has cooled me off," he remarked quietly, as, shaking himself, he turned away. Perhaps none of -the bystanders were so highly di- verted as the dandy of the "English exclusives," at the misstep of his late adversary. The triumph seemed to open his heart to humanity in general; for, gleefully rubbing his hands together, he cast an ap- pealing glance around, exclaiming: "Aw, yes, that cooled him, the hair down 'ere is very 'ot, too lot for 'im, it seems." "The hair down 'ere is quite red 'ot," agreed Mr. More in an aside to the laughing Alice, fixing his eyes upon the cockney's unmistakably fiery chevelure. That timely plunge proved the means of ridding Miss Lynde and her uncle, who now joined her, of their incumbrance; as the guidance of an active young peasant in a shorter path to Weggis, and the nearer- prospect of fire and good cheer at the Lion d'Or, were attractions more powerful than even the budding charms of the Rose of Lyndhurst. Far from tedious was the descent to our travelers. Traveling companions made themselves agreeable, and the guide had many an anecdote or legend to relate. Nor did he omit the tradition of the fount- ain of the three sisters, who, fleeing from the pursuit of a wicked Austrian bailiff, found, refuge in these cliffs, their retreat unknown, themselves forgot, until  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7551-00000061"/> 120        INGORWSCO. on one bright noontide three stars arose above the mountain and stood still, filling the heavens with their mystic silvery radiance. And here, in the quiet dell they pointed out, the peasants wandering found the sisters together lying at rest forever. And the foun. tain springing there, then endowed with miraculous powers, is called the Schwesterborn in memory of them. Twilight was changing into night when the little steamer returning from Fluelen touched at Weggis on its way to Luzeri. And as it neared Luzern, the moon in full, unclouded splendor was shining down upon every shadowy bay and rock-bound cove, bath- ing the mountain-tops in glory, and throwing upon the waters, in yet sterner profile, the dark-browed, fir-crowned promontories. Whiter than the moon- light slope to the water's edge the ramparts of Lu- zern, the monotony broken by picturesque towers and antique covered bridges. Dreary and silent at night is Luzern, with its dimly lighted streets and uniformly closed houses. Little sound of passing feet in the deserted squares. Only the ever-restless rushing of the river, and occasional distant tones of music, are heard by our weary ones as they gain the welcome shelter and take possession of the cheerful, comfortable apartments of the Cheval Blanc.   W. "'PIGMES are pigmies still, though perched on Alps." "Ho! for the Pilate!" cheered Harry May, as next morning the steamer from Luzern rounded the bend of the lake here broadening across to the base of the Righi, which rises opposite in proud preeminence over the surrounding shores. And in the stern presence of the Pilate the boat touched at the village of Wergiswyl, brilliant in its array of cottages many-hued, encircled by neat gar- dens, nestling in whitening orchards, or in vineyards glowing with the faint purple light of ripening clus- ters. Wergiswyl was in holiday mood. It was the fete of some patron saint, and throngs of peasants in holi- day attire poured into the chapel erected upon the declivity of a hill, the white walls, rustic porch, and golden cross surmounting all, gleaming out prettily enow amid the massy shade and fawn-colored trunks of a clump of maples. No one to be found within the precincts of the inn save an ancient croner for whom the charms of high days and holidays had doubtless long since departed with her own. She, rousing from a half doze in her arm-chair close beside the great stove filling up one  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7551-00000062"/> 1 22        INGEMSGO. side of the kitchen, gave the information that besides the fete a grand wedding was going on-Marie Mul- ler, the pride of Wergiswyl, really to- marry the young miller at last. He would not stay for kilt- gang nor for carnival, not he--nor even for a Monday wedding. "'A bird in the hand,' and as .her old grandmother is dead and gone at last-ach! it seems but the other day when she was married in the self- same chapel, and I her bridesmaid-and now., weh mir, a stranger is Gelbe to her granddaughter, and here am I, all doubled up with the rheumatism." The old crone began to sway herself back and for- ward moaningly, and Falkenstein, seeing a shade darken' Margaret's brow, hastened to make the de- mand for horses. No, certainly, there were no horses in the masters absence. But the strangers might wait here, or out in the garden, where they could see the wedding procession as it came forth. Of course, the garden was the choice. Margaret lingered an instant at the door, with ag silver piece burning in her hand, and a word of comfort on her lips and in her eye, for the lonely old creature. But the silver piece returned to her purse, the word of comfort gave place to a shy, unnoticed glance of admiration, as she saw that what she waited behind the others to do unperceived, another had done before her. Count Zalkiewski stood with his back to her, but she could see the faint light flicker- ing across that withered face as he bent reverently down, with speech as valuable-well, almost as val- uable, as the gold over which the bony fingers clench- ed, and to which in an instant more the eager eyes had fallen. Margaret moved softly away.   INGEMSCO.         123 "Come and help us, Margaret," cried Alice as her sister made her way into the garden, "we're all in a perfect whirl of peasant weddings, and not a little embarrassed between Lichtgetreu, and Stubetegetreu, Dorfen, and Kiltgang." "Mercy!"Margaret exclaimed, while Count Fal- kenstein interposed. "Miss Ross is perhaps more familiar with the Eng- lish courtship, which all these words express with dif- ferent attendant customs in the different cantons." "Oh! But speaking of weddings, what meant that old woman's lament that she could not be Gelbe?" Margaret asked of Count Zalkiewski. "The Gelbe or Yellow woman," he replied, "is the old woman who is mistress of ceremonies, attends the bride to church, removes from her brow the bridal wreath after the ceremony, and during the merry- making following, which the bridegroom begins by dancing three times with the bride, takes that wreath and the bridegroom's bouquet, -submitting both to the ordeal by fire, to augur, by their manner of burning, the happiness or misery the future has in store. And And a sound of mingled voices, and adown the chapel hill streamed the procession. In observance of an ancient custom, foremost and alone walked the bride, resplendent in rustling silks. A rustic costume, immense' stomacher of rich brocade, square, velvet, silver-broidered collar, with massive silver chains crossing from the corners behind, and passing under the arms to the front.  The fair, abundant hair, woven in long braids, was adorned by a huge bouquet. The dress, rich in itself, and graceful on her slender  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7551-00000063"/> 124         I2tGROTSCO. figure,.was lightened by the full white sleeves con fined with ribbons at the elbow.  Next followed, one by one, the bridesmaids, in costume somewhat similar, but of materials generally less rich. But what alteration soever in the dress, still the inev- itable bouquet rising in stately fashion up from the back of the head. Then came relatives and friends, two by two, and at the inn met the bridegroom and his party, who by another approach arrived at the same goal. These presented the appearance of so many ambulatory bouquets, each bearing aloft an umbrella literally covered with garlands. As soon as a hearing was possible amid the strains of music and the merry congratulations of friends, our travelers sought out the landlord and speedily obtained the horses in request. And, turning upon the mountain-side to take a last lingering look down upon the Wergiswyl, they soon forgot its music and its merriment in the mournful glories of Pilatus, as the echoes forgot those gladsome tones, dwelling only in these heights upon those sounds, the distant lowing of the cattle, or the tink- ling of their- bells far off in hidden glens, the cry of some lone bird disturbed in its resting-place in yon- der pines and fluttering with heavy wing away until it seems but a speck upon the clear blue sky, the ripple of a mountain brook, the whirring of the sum- mer insects in the flowers, sounds ,so impressive of solitude and stillness that they might seem the whisper of silence, asserting her right supreme among these heights. Memory's echoes chime in with those around,   INGEMSCO.           125 Margaret, as Count Falkenstein    rides beside her, gayer and more amusing because he is beside her, hears rather a deep voice growing softer in speaking to an aged peasant woman. "After noontide, the clouds which had traversed the east Half the day, gathered closer and rose and increased ; The air changed and chilled; as though out of the ground There crept up the trees a confused, hissing sound; And the wind rose. The guides snuffed like chamois, the air, And looked at each other, and halted, and there Unbuckled the cloaks from their saddles." That was ere the twilight fell, turning into a dull, impenetrable gray the silvery mists that had risen densely from the valleys, rendering the descent of the Pilate perfectly impracticable. All hope of reaching Wergiswyl, the destined so- journ for the night, was past.  Around the evening camp-fire, built where an overhanging rock afforded' shelter from the dews, were exchanged regrets for the loss of those weddingo festivities now  in full tide at the inn; and- "Will there be a supper? O dear! how hungry I am!" cried Alice. "' Piglmies are pigmies still, though perched on Alps,'" Mr. More quoted sententiously. "At all events, I for one prefer pigmies to pyra- mids, sepulchres full of dead men's bones. No, Mam- ma," in reply to a suggestion from Mrs. Ross.   "I'll not quite starve before to-morrow morning, perhaps, and we had better keep our provisions for breakfast.

"They are so delightfully mysterious and " "( Hollow. Space within all mysteries whether of place or of life, for the concealment of ghastly secrets like your dead mens' bones," Falkenstein replied, look- ing fall and angrily upon Count Zalkiewski, who, his arm resting on the tree against which Margaret sat, listened with bent head to her low speech. He met the look with another so haughty that Falkenstein, irritated beyond measure, spoke again, and this time with marked emphasis: "They vail themselves from the light who fear it. As pyramids shelter in vales their devious ways, and the grinning skeleton in their dark places." A merry remark or two was made upon the quaint conceit. But Count Zalkiewski's eyes flashed fire, and his lips curled as he muttered between his set teeth words that to Margaret's astonishment sounded strangely like " puppy's impertinence."  She glanced around hastily, but not having recognized the bark, and discovering no evidence of puppyism within the assembled circle-Harry on one knee beside Mrs. Ross, arranging her shawls with tender solicitude; Mr. Ross and Mr. Lynde deep in British politics; Falkenstein leaning on his elbow at Alice's feet, sur- rounded by the Baroness, Mr. More, and Rose Lynde, in gay conclave-she concluded herself mistaken 'in Zalkiewski's remark, and innocently inquired what he had said. At that instant Rose's voice called upon her: "(Miss Ross, don't you want to hear a story? I've learned by heart every one of our Lancashire tales of fairy, witch and ghost; and I love them far better than   PINGEMSCO.        127 any novel. And since Count Falkenstein says these mountains have been the haunt of pigmies from time immemorial, and confesses to having this morning heard a legend of' this same Pilatus, don't you think he is in duty bound to tell it us?" "'I do indeed. Count Falkenstein, you surely can not refuse." "Now," Rose interrupted, "I protest this way of proceeding will never do in the world. Here we are to-night, as completely isolated by this great sea of fog as ever was Crusoe on his sea-girt island. Sup- pose, then, being beyond the reach of any known principalities and powers, we were to have a queen of our own-one who shall reign after the absolute monarch-of-all-I-survey fashion. All who vote for Miss Ross, hold up their hands," she cried suddenly, raising her own. Instantly all were up, save Count Falkenstein's. His followed more slowly as the Baroness clapped her hands, and gave the shout, "Vive la reine Mar- guerite!" And "long live the Queen!" astonished all those republican cliffs that kept on repeating it in faint tones of wondering expostulation, as Margaret said. A long spray of ground-ivy clambered up the rock. In a moment Harry had twined it into a rude chaplet, and, advancing, dropped it now on Margaret's brow. Very graceful it was; resting there, the glossy ten- drils mingling with the gleaming waves of her hair. And very graceful, very lovely she, her heightened color and downcast lashes lit up by the blazing fire, as, when Harry had dropped on one knee before  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7551-00000065"/> 128        INGEMSCOi her and raised her hand to his lips, swearing in set terms fealty to his liege lady. Count Zalkieswki came forward and followed his example. Very much provoked with Harry for thus occasion- ing this breach of English etiquette, Margaret yet felt that a protest against that which so obviously was within the bounds of foreign etiquette, would be a ridiculous excess of prudery. So she did not suffer annoyance to- render her manner less gracious than became her sovereign ladyship, as one by one the gentlemen thus swore allegiance. Mr. Ross had caught Margaret's, quick glance, and, understanding it, was next after Count Zalkiewski, and followed by -Mr. Lynde. Count Falkenstein last. If, however, he had wished to pique Margaret, he failed, for she did not observe his tardiness. "And now," she said, as he resumed his place at Alice's feet, "our armies swore terribly in Flanders, but nothing to this, if you all have sworn in sober verity. Are you not each and all bound on your honor as gentlemen to obey unquestioningly my every com- mand to-night?" "On my honor as a gentleman." Only one voice silent in this general asseveration, but the silence un- noted. "Take care," she returned, with mock gravity. "Think, each. of you, how strange and how capricious an absolute sovereign's will may be. And more es- pecially, a lady sovereign's. Weigh well, I beSeech you, your decision, ere you speak again. For I shall hold you to it. And now, what say you, leal sub- jects all? An absolute or a limited monarchy?" "Ugh!  C'est fait d'eux!" cried the Baroness,   INGMrSCO.         129 shrugging her graceful shoulders. "Are you not con- tente," turning to Alice, "that it is not but the mes- sieurs who do this vow? There is a je ne sais quoi of portent in the figure so serious of our queen. She amuses herself to play the majestic, mais, messieurs, gare, gare!" Margaret's throne meanwhile established, she turned to Count Falkenstein with an arch smile. "To queen it every inch," she said, "we command our trusty subject to give us that legend." He bowed without a glance, and after an instant's pause obeyed: "It is the Lady Magdalena, and she - sits there on yonder rock, while shriek the fierce winds by, echo- ing Pilate's shriek long ages gone that echoed here from cliff to cliff. Far down, where the mists, the darkened waves' gray foam, whirl and eddy, Pilate's Lake shivers c in the briered dell below.' For Pilate's wraith, dark-shrouded on the mountain's brow, has donned his judgment-cap of clouds, and thunders forth the sentence a knell henceforth forever to his soul. "It is the lovely Lady Magdalena, and her golden hair," his eyes rested slowly upon Alice, " floats upon the wind like a wavering moonbeam on the night. And her voice rings clear and low amid the rushing storm, like elfin-bells tolling the death of the summ er day. "' Nay, but Alois, I love thee not ' "That know I right well, lady,' answers sadly he of the shining coat of mail, bending before her until the eagle plume upon the casque which he has doffed, sweeps the ground. "That know I all too well, and therefore come I not to-night seeking love, but showing my liege ,lady  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7551-00000066"/> 130        INGEMSCO. how her commands have been obeyed; seeking new com- mands and beseeching her gage for the coming combat.' " UAnd- the white rosebuds from the Garden of Love which thou sayest the great Dragon guards perpetu- ally from the grasp of men, scattering instead the blood- red passion-flowers without the gates?' "'They are thine, lady. See, so long have I borne them on my heart, that a drop of blood burns upon that thorn. Nay, let me bind them round thine arm. The thorns shall not hurt thee.' "Neither consenting nor refusing, she suffers him to wreathe those velvet buds round the wrist, whiter than the creamy petals beside the single crimson drop upon the now harmless out-turned thorn. And with- out one word of'hope, yet not altogether hopeless, he bows before her and is gone. "She does not care to watch him, but her gaze fol- lows absently as she rises, moving on her homeward path. And lo! where he late knelt in manly, loving reverence, in open homage and sworn fealty, another stands. It seems he is a gallant knight, one of proud bearing, certainly, and noble presence. It seems his armor shines out bright, and stained by no thick blood from muddy veins. It seems yon is the flash of knight- ly sword in his firm grasp. It seems, for a heavy mist has vailed-the form. And behind its mysterious sha- dows, who can distinguish between the flash of knightly steel and the gleam of gems priceless, yet, oh! surely, baser? "Pilate thunders, and Pilate's thunders die; mists gather, and winds scatter them forever: months come and go, and their footprints are trodden away by those that hurry after.   "But those rosebuds, long since twined around the Lady Magdalena's arm are not dead, not faded, though crushed they are and broken, as she pressed above them a massive jeweled bracelet which she strives with lingering fingers to secure. "She has risen from yonder rock, and stands before it proudly. The winds are shrieking, ghosts of echoes ages dead. Far down, where mists, the darkened waters' foam, are whirling, Pilate's Lake shivers 'in the briered dell below.'

And her voice is trembling like the waters' swell as she murmurs, touching flowers and gems: "(There is not room for both upon my wrist.' "He to whom she speaks, he whom she knows beside her, though she looks not up, the mist-vailed knight, responds with slow emphasis: "'There is not room for both.' "Her eyes are misty as she turns and gazes, her hand wavers, the clasp of the jeweled bracelet is entangled in the flower-stems-one movement, and they are broken asunder. "They are gone.

But, n'en d6plaise, you have not improved the traditionary legend. The Lady Mag- dalena is the peasant maiden Magdalena; Alois the knight, Alois the shepherd; the knight of mists, a green-clad elf, with one little beard of silver sweeping down to his little chamois boots; and the diamond bracelet that he bore, a great golden cheese. En outre, the spirit of the stories is so different! False- hood in this, truth in the other." "Not falsehood," he returned, smoking on in lazy indifference. "The lovely Lady Magdalena had not pledged herself, had scarcely received passively the votive roses. And diamonds outgleam heart's blood, you will allow.

Allons, Marguerite, ma mie, may you not command one little tale, one pretty history of the good and the true, to banish this bete noire of Max's fancy?" "On whom shall I call?" asked Margaret. Count Zalkiewski had all this while stood with bowed head at her side, but he now advanced, throw- ing himself on the rock before her, with a defiant, steady gaze on Falkenstein. "'Upon me, liege lady," he replied, "and may Ma- dame la Baronne judge of the truth of my story.   INGEMSCO.        133 "It was in a hovel that they parted, those two who are so near and yet so far. In a squalid, poverty-strick- en hovel, at the cold, dark midnight hour, years ago. They clung to each other then, and they dreamed not of the years to come between them. But they camo and went, those dreary years, and they met again. Wearily yet steadily he had toiled upward through life's journey, and now stood upon the summit of that mountain whither gentle hands and loving had led her dancing feet. Wearily he had toiled up, and wearily stood there, looking in her bright eyes for one smile of recognition and of comfort. And she--she turned to watch the mazes of the dance, to hearken to the mirthful voices, to rejoice in the sunshine and the glad- ness. Let it be. Year crowds on year, life crowds on life, and there must be some dimmed links in the great chain of eternity." There was silence. A chill had fallen over all, and they sat looking toward him for explanation. He, meantime, had never moved his eyes from the Bar- oness Waldien's face. Raising hers slowly at last, she met his gaze, and responded to it with fretful im- patience, while she shivered as with cold. "A dismal sketch, Herr Count, mais, a quoi bon? For what should one break the heart in looking back at the darkness left behind? The world cares not for the hovel in the valley when it stands by the palace on the mountain's brow. Ni moi non plus. Thousand thanks, Monsieur, and you, my Max, but I think in truth you -might have been'less dismal, considering time and place."  And shivering still, she drew nearer to the cheerful firelight.

And all felt, as they saw the shade upon the Baron- ess's brow, and marked her gesture of vexation, that it called up some unpleasant memory to her. Zalkiewski rose presently, and lighting a segar, strolled away out of sight.  At least so Margaret thought, but her attention was quickly in demand by Mr. Lynde, who possessed himself of the place the Count's defection had left vacant. "Our story-tellers have called up none- but the 'blue spirits,' it would seem, Miss Ross." "And quite left out the 'mingle, mingle, ye who mingle may,'" she responded, catching at his refer- ence. '"Yet this of all others is the occasion demanding that mingling.  Why, you actually are blue yourself, and I have seen you shiver twice. I do not doubt you see Pilate's Lake with its shrinking waves down through yonder gray fog beneath that cliff." She smiled .faintly as, following the direction to which he pointed, her eyes fell upon a solitary figure half in shadow. "Aha! I  knew it. This will not do. If we do not get up a laugh  " "A   laugh!" exclaimed Margaret. "But we  can not laugh to order." "Can not you?  Listen." Listen she did perforce, however, at this moment, to a   summons which Alice came  across from  her mother to. deliver. And when, again at leisure, a quarter of an hour after, she heard Alice's gay laugh- ter beside Mr. Lynde, she stole away from the now lively circle to listen to her own tumultuous thoughts.   INGEMSCO.        185 She was leaning, beyond the red glare of the fire, over the brink of the precipice where the cool fog flung against her brow. Without a single reason, she averred to herself, she felt cold and comfortless as that fog, and she seemed to see an indefinable drear mistiness closing in around her. Presently a voice startled her. How:Iong she had been there apart she knew not, but she saw now that the merry group was scattered from before the fire, and that silence had fallen there. She half rose, but that voice startled -her-not only by its near neigh- borhood-for the speaker must have been beside the rock concealing her-but by the icy sternness of its tones, "I have interpreted your legend, Count Falken- stein, and understood your every word this evening. Am I right in my conclusion that words and legend were insults offered to me?" "Most obviously right. If my speech were some- what obscure, I remembered who was present. If it strikes you not clearly now, I believe I must add to my definition of adventurer and impostor, that of " Falkenstein began hotly and continued with a sneer. He had misconstrued the calmness of his opponent, whose haughty gesture now staid further insult on his lips. It was needless. "Enough,"' Zalkiewski said quietly. "I am but a fool to throw away life in a fool's quarrel, but so be it. I reek not. We meet, Count Falkenstein, the third day from the morrow, if it so please you. That is, I believe, the earliest date which can be fixed upon after    j the return to Schwyz." Falkenstein bowed. But before he could utter a       !

Not one wo she uttered, but she lifted her clasped hands in mute appeal. Count Zalkiewsi bowed and would have passed on, but quick as thought she caught his arm. "What is all thi" she demanded. "Nay, you shall not evade me, sw not deny me! Count Fal- kenstein, Count Zalkie ski, you are my father's guests as well upon this  ountain height as in his native halls--and is this feud between his guests a meet return for hospitality?" \ "Forgive me, Mademoiselle.\ Count Falkenstein and I have no more words. The feud is adjusted as we both would wish."     i She looked from one to the other as he spoke. Fal- kenstein had' coldly bowed, and stood withdrawn, watching with a supercilious smile. She wrung her hands. "I am no eavesdropper, and I did not hear your words," she said; "but I am not blind, and I see too well all is not right, O Count Falkenstein! you will listen to me," and she turned to him, her face flush- ing and her voice trembling in her eagerness; "you will not hear me entreat in vain." "Mademoiselle, this is scarcely a woman's prov- ince," he replied. "A wcman's province!" She stamped her foot involuntarily. cA woman's province is to clap her white hands on her delicate ears, and glide softly away with downcast eyes, that she may not hear the angry words, may not see the shedding of blood, for- sooth!

Her color went and came with rapid change. She breathed hard and clenched her hand upon her bo- som, struggling for composure. Zalkiewski flashed an angry glance on Falkenstein, and with a muttered "fool!" strode to her side. Falkenstein started for- ward, dismayed at the effect of his words. "Mademoiselle," Zalkiewski said soothingly, "you agitate yourself unnecessarily for a few rash words. Forget them. Words are but air, and madmen only seek to grasp them." Site fixed her eyes wistfully upon him. But she could not read the unwavering firmness with which he met them. Suddenly they kindled as with some new thought. She extended her hand to Falkenstein.  He lifted it gallantly to his lips; and leaving it in his clasp, she spoke: '-'It is scarce an hour since two gentlemen swore upon their honor as gentlemen to obey a certain lady's every command this evening. They can not have for- gotten that." An embarrassed silence, which she broke after an instant impetuously: "They were warned, twice warned, and swore again." "You mistake, H-"Falkenstein began, but stop- ped, while a flush of shame stole across his brow. "And they can not, can not withdraw now," she continued, not noticing the interruption; "they dare  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7551-00000070"/> 138        XLGEMsCO. not break a pledge, albeit lightly made, which, when made, within their heart of hearts they meant to keep. They dare not forfeit that, because they thought nothing would be exacted. 'Nay, but I will exact!" "Ungenerous!"Count Zalkiewski said in a tone of unconcealed annoyance, as she turned toward him, a faint smile fluttering on her lips. "Your hand, Count Zalkiewski," she demanded, heedless of his ejaculation. "Mademoiselle, you know not what you ask," he answered sternly. "You dare not, for a mere whim, for a thoughtless promise, a rashy-pledged honor, force me to forfeit honor indeed. My word is given to Count Falkenstein, and that word I must keep to the death. You will not ask me to break that." "I will and I dare. Mine was the first firm prom- ise. Your hand, Count Zalkiewski." She trembled as though the blast that swept around had power to shake her, and her voice quivered in every accent. But she met his stern eyes unshrink- ingly.  "Mademoiselle, I will not. Your right hand is in the friendly grasp of one who has this night heaped upon me unprovoked insult--insult that I can not forget, and will not forgive." She turned to Falkenstein, a frown upon her brows. She spoke aside to him, at first hurriedly and angrily, and then more gently as his replies were calmer. "'What do you gain by compliance?" she repeated at last. "For shame, Count Falkenstein! You gain the sense of right-for well you know that insult of- fered Count Zalkiewski were injustice.  You keep your promise. You gain, and firmly, my poor friend-   INGEMSCO.        139 ship, on which you seem to set some store. Come! You will hesitate no longer." Falkenstein advanced a few paces, and said in cold, reluctant tones. ' "Count Zalkiewski, since Miss Ross numbers you among her friends, I regret my words this evening; I retract, and apologize for them. Will that do?" he added, scarcely lower, to Margaret. Count Zalkiewski raised his head proudly. He had stood apart, with folded arms and haughty bear- ing, awaiting the result of this colloquy. "And since Miss Ross has chosen to lay such stress upon a thoughtless pledge of mine," he said, "I can not do otherwise than accept that apology." He turned away among the rocks, unmindful of Margaret's half entreating gesture of detention. Falkenstein watched him with a mocking smile. "Beim Teufel," he muttered, "but he carries a high head, for all the adventurer I could swear he is, Mademoiselle," he said aloud, "are you not proud of your achievement-oil upon the tloubled waters, etc., etc.?"  "The troublesome waters," she amended, wearily sup- pressing a yawn. "rAnd after all, I don't know that it is not an oleaginous expenditure on a tempest in a tea-pot.

And what is that?" cried Alice, starting to her feet and rubbing her half-shut eyes as at early dawn, clear and loud through defiles inter vening, echoed the distant Alpine horn, startling her into wakefulness. And as the changes rang out loud and louder, and then died away through distant wavering mists, the low and solemn tones were caught up by voices near at hand--two voices, repeating with joyous and yet solemn confidence the "Praise God the Lord.". Instinctively Margaret sank upon her knees. Alice had stopped in the midst of a. yawn, and even the giddy Baroness, raising herself on her elbows listened in reverent silence. "What is it?" Rose Lynde asked in an awe-struck whisper, when the voices ceased as suddenly. "It came like an angel's message in these solitudes," said Alice, looking round  somewhat fearfully in the gray uncertain light. "Voila your angels," laughed the Baroness, when with a shout and a halloo Hans and his fellow-guaide sprang out from behind a rock and flung themselves Z   TNGoElSCO.        141 from crag to crag, in pursuit of a horse that had brok- en loose from his tether during the night, and was now leisurely following the path down the mountain, perchance with a reminiscence of yesterday's break- fast at the inn-stable. In default of to-day's breakfast at the inn below, the travelers were soon partaking of a repast somewhat more dainty than plentiful, served up of yesterday's superabundance upon a rocky table which Margaret had garnished with such profusion of the wild flowers gleaming here in every crevice, that Harry gravely requested a wing of the Alpenrosen before her. Margaret found herself by accident placed between the quondam hostile Counts. She glanced from the fiery restlessness of the one to the proud unmoved- ness of the other, and bethought herself of an ancient half-forgotten rhyme of " feather-bed 'twixt iron wall and heavy brunt of cannon-ball," which she was con- vinced must havebeen written with reference to her- self. Falkenstein was all attention to her, and she feared to give more than that first glance to her silent cdmpanion until, as the general conversation turned upon the strange echoes and the angel message, he joined in without embarrassment. , . "You forget," he said, " that we are very near the regions of 'the pious Unterwalder' of Swiss pro- verb.

The guide from Wergiswyl, who' prided himself upon his knowledge of the English language, actual- ly did comprehend the pith of her speech--Swiss dai- ries-and hastened to inform her that he could do the honors of one lying almost in the path to Wergiswyl. "And da is Siste and Ziege to the best," he added hungrily. Mrs. Ross smiled. "The Siste and Ziege are two most interesting fea- tures of the case, beyond doubt, my good fellow. Well, we'll put it to the vote. Who would study manners and customs this morning? Or, to put it more plainly-to eat cheese or not to eat cheese? that is the question."  A question very readily decided in the affirmative by a host of half-breakfasted wanderers. And, once more mounted, they follow gayly in the wake of the guides. Margaret and Count Falkenstein rode on side by side. Silently they rode at first, for Margaret was looking her farewell to the dark-blue Righi, from whose brow the sun had not lifted the vail-looking her farewell to the lake of the four Forest Cantons, lying crimson-flushing in the arms of those guardian mountains, Righi and Pilatus--looking her -farewell back upon the far-distant white walls of Luzern, and nearer, upon the gray battlements of last night's re- fuge.   INGEMSCO.         143 The cliffs were broken now by long slopes and tiny glens of verdure, where the brilliant flowers, erewhile flinging themselves unseen from cliffs and crevices, or clinging to the gaunt gray rock, glowed in vivid bril- liance through the grass. There resounded the tin- kle .of a cow-bell and the lowing of cattle browsing in sleek content beside the frequent rivulet. And now, descending by a steep path trampled by that herd, where a waterfall leaped after with no little clamor, our travelers gained a sheltered nook where, in midst of a plateau trodden into miry clay by a multitude of hoofs, was reared- the chalet or Senne- hutte, the goal of their pilgrimage. This, however picturesque it may have appeared from a distance, the plashing waterfall beside, the grassy heights above, mossy rocks towering around like ancient ivy-mantled ruins, was at a nearer view very, very un-chalet-like, and most prosaically ugly. Built of logs notched at the ends to fit into each other, and the roof of great shingles kept in place by heavy stones, its only -adornments were glimpses of cloudless blue let in mosaic-wise through the airy roof. The Senne himself, a corpulent, jolly, middle-aged peasant, stood in the doorway to give his visitors hearty welcome, and then escorted them   into the principal apartment. A long, low room with blackened rafters crossing it--blackened, for in its centre a fire-place, a cavity paved with stones, sent forth its smoke, to find an egress as best it might, and it laid a grimy touch here and there in clambering to that opening above in the roof. Fixed upon two poles hang the milk-pails, and on that bench is a butter-tub and a great bucket of  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7551-00000073"/> "4         saGEMsco . whey which is drunk instead of water. In whey, too, are the! milking utensils washed, and a wheyey odor about a certain garment hung against the wall with- out, to dry in the sunshine, gives rise to a strange suspicion. There is a long table upon which, sweeping aside various dippers, spoons, and ladles, and the large tub which receives the milk until the foam set- tles, the hospitable Senne spreads his simple repast, and his guests make acquaintance with the various preparations by boiling, curdling, etc., and wax en- thusiastic over the merits of Suffi, Schotte, Siste--all the changes of a Senne's meals. They watch the Senne as he stands over the huge copper cauldron suspended above the fire, where he is warming the milk for cheese, and, putting in the rennet, stirs until all is curdled. And then when he has dipped "up and drained the curds, they follow him into the milk-room. In this, dark and semi-sub- terranean, Margaret had light thrown upon a subject of previous wonderment to her, namely, why the Senne had not built rather upon the alp above-when she saw the clear stream from the waterfall flowing through here, keeping all so fresh and cool. A peep at the sky-light sleeping-floor above, with its accommodations of fragrant hay, did not, however, awaken unfavorable comparison with those of the night before. And after a duty-inspection of the trio of prime pigs fattening in a third apartment, the visi- tors strolled off, accompanied in their setting-out by the talkative Senne. At the foot of the steep where foamed and eddied the fountain in a thousand rainbow hues, and then gurgled away over green moss and shining pebbles   -tNEGISCO.         145 to its dairy duties in the Senner hut, Margaret paused and turned as cliff upon cliff opened a vista of wood- ed hollows, of sudden gorges, and, perched aloft, like a great, green bough flung midway between sky and earth, a pasture whence came a far-off echo of bells, as cattle ranged in undistinguishable blurs of white or dark across it. "Ah!" she cried, " that is just the site for castles in the air! Away with chateaux en Espagne! I'll build up there, all among the elves, and where Pilate shall lift his cap to me every bright good-morrow." The Senne had. regarded her very seriously the -while. "But, mein Fraulein," he hastened to interpose, "' you can not build your castle there. I say nothing of its being so bleak and lonely the winter long to a young lady like yourself.  But neighbor Johann Schwarz has pastured his herds up there these twenty years come midsummer, and he is not likely, for all the heavy cheeses come and gone, to sell the best alp in the mountains round." "What!" exclaimed Alice; " you do not mean that all those handfuls of grass belong to any, but chamois and the birds of the air?" "Ganz gewiss, Fraulein; there is not a tuft in all these cantons which is not portioned out either to communes or individuals. And that to which the lady refers is among the best of -our' high-alps, our highest verdure-clad heights, where though the cows can remain but for three summer weeks, yet there the pasture is finest of all.

Lower, apd perhaps not so good for milch cows; but after all, one may make that up in the care of the cheese-one may make that up in care and skill." Whereupon followed the anticipated compliment upon the products of his dairy, and then Mrs. Ross inquired if from three to eight weeks were all the time the alps were in use. "The high-alps, lady. But down below, at the base, we pasture on the fore-alps, some weeks before and after." "And then your work is over for the year?" "Then comes the fete, and we return to our valley homes. We have work enough down there, what with spinning, silk-carding, wood-carvingo and what not; and our youths return to the village schools, where the good cures have enough to do to bring back the learning lost in the long summer months on the mountains."' "And how long before you are off to the mountains again?'- "When the snow melts, and the green grass beck- ons us up. You know our proverb, gracious lady, 'No April so good that each hedge has not its hate'. But the Faun soon clears a pathway for us." "The Faun? What is that?" "Not know the Faun?" and he glanced at Mrs. Ross, as who should say, "argues thyself unknown," while he explained: "The Faun is a hot wind from the south, blowing often in one current during ap entire week, and it dries up the snow as fast as elfin ban'the greenest pastures. Wirklich, it melts more in a single day   I GEMSCO.        147 than the sun in seven. It is so warm that buds sometimes come forth to meet the spring, and frisch! here has winter gathered them all in his cold grasp presently. Besides, the Faun can rage so wildly that we dare not light a fire for fear of houseburning, and last year it carried off half the roofs in Wergiswyl." "And the avalanches, are you in no danger here from those?" asked Margaret. "From avalanches in time of snow, and landslides after heavy rains. Sapperlot! a landslide beats the devil at his own game of getting us down below. Why, I myself was once dug out of one three days deep." "Oh! tell me about it!"Margaret cried eagerly. "Come, come, Margaret," remonstrated her father. "See, your mother is already half-way up the steep, and every one is mounted. It will not do to keep them waiting." "Hans will wait for me, papa," she pleaded. "Do go, papa. We can overtake you in ten minutes. Hark! there is mamma calling." "Only a moment then, child," he said as he rode away, while Margaret turned again to the Senne. "Do tell me your story. I have staid on purpose to hear it." And she seated herself upon a crag jut- ting out over the rivulet. "It was many a year ago, Fraiulein. I was a young man then, and a sturdy, and reckoned the finest hand at the cross-bow and the best shot among themount- ains. So said the neighbors round, and I, as young madcap, gloried above all things in that which so nearly proved my ruin. But you shall judge.

I had flung it Idown within the threshold, and was stooping over, feeling the fat upon the ribs and thinking of the feast I would make upon the morrow, and how I would boast over all the lads of this, my hundredth shot within the year. For you must know, Fraulein, that for all I am getting stout and cumbrous now," looking down com- placently upon his robust, well-knit frame, mine was as light a foot, as sure and fleet, as ever pursued cha- mois up the heights where he clambered and thought himself secure, standing there as though defying pur- suit. So that through all the Forest Cantons I was nicknamed The Chamois' Evil Genius. '"Well, there I stood, almost burying my fingers in the creature's fat, thinking of the praises at the morrow's feast, seeing beforehand the applauding eyes, and es- pecially one pair as bright and blue as heaven, and laughing as I cried aloud, ' The Chamois' Evil Genius i' when, hussasa! horridoh! with the tramp of a thou- sand hoofs, down swept from the heights above-what, I did not then know, but it was an army of slaughter- ed chamois, all the chamois I had slain from early boyhood.

"It was toward the close of the third day, as I learned afterward, that I heard a faint, low rumbling sound, I thought of distant earthquake. So stupefied and so indifferent now, it failed to rouse me for a single in- stant, until there came a prolonged shout, an agony of anxiety in every tone, which I thought then would have quickened me in any tomb. Instantly I sprang up, replying with a shout which startled my own ears with its sudden power; and groping for my spade, knocking away with it a rafter, to work I went in the direction of that voice. Soon it drew near and nearer, and anon, as the spades let in the blessed sunset light, I was welcomed by that voice and a score of others. "You raised your pretty brows a while ago, Frau- lein, when I told of the phantom herd trampling down with spirit-hoofs that slide of earth.

I was, and of proud ones too, as I too turned to look back, but farther than thou, even toward the far cliff where I had seen thee stand that evening, while thy rifle rang out so sharply and the chamois dropped dead at thy feet. I gazed, and presently I brushed my hand across my eyes, if perchance some cobweb from the leafy beech had blown across them, distort- ing what I looked upon, and looked again. How they trooped adown the mountain-passes, scores on scores of antlers glancing in the reddened sunset! Scores on scores! Down they rushed, faster and faster, down, and passing, oh I so near, where winds the path, you know,- a stone's throw off. And as they passed, without a sound save that of flying hoofs, the exultation wherewith I had watched and thought, "My huntsman has another shot to-night, it seems," changed to a pang of deadly fear. I went into the hut and shut the door. For, O Gottheb! mounted on the foremost chamois, clinging to his neck, a gree4- coated mountain elf rode on, so swiftly that his silvery beard blended with the white moonbeams through the beeches, as he rode.

"And where is she, the brave maiden of the bright blue eyes?" questioned the eager maiden of the bright blue eyes. "In God's Acre, Fraulein, down yonder at Wergis- wyl." "You are not married then?" and the bright blue eyes grew dim as she dropped them from his face. "Hei! what would you have, dear Fraulein? My Sanchen is a good wife, a good mother. And around the cross above her she twines the immortelles." The jovial countenance, saddened by a moment's memory, brightened again as Margaret gave him cor- dial thanks for his story and his hospitality. "Perhaps I shall see you to-morrow," he said while she mounted her horse--then explained to the in- quiry in her face, "To-morrow, you know, is Tell's Procession, and all the cantons go to Altdorf." "I too," she responded, nodding farewell.  And loosing the bridle, she sped up the steep where Hans awaited. And not Hans alone.  She turned in surprise when Count Falkenstein fell in beside her. "You here!" she exclaimed, "oh! then you should have been yonder at the fountain, with elves and cha- mois-ghosts and bright blue eyes." "Bright blue eyes have been my ignis fatuus too long," he muttered. "You were listening," he added gayly, "to some legend, I judged from your interest- ed face, as I kept my eyes on you, and you yours on your peasant. What was it all about?"

The olive-brown complexions and tall red caps of the men, and the women's pale classic features, exposed by the mezzaro or white vail thrown over the many-bodkined tresses, were familiar to Margaret as Genoese. "They are pilgrims to Our Lady of Einsiedlen," Hans replied; and Count Falkenstein, interpreting the expression of her face, said: "What, is she not of your connaissances? Despite her legend? the which if I relate, will you forget my ungracious story last night, granting plenary indul- gence, Madonna, as that Madonna to the suppliants at her shrine? But you may be weary of legends?" "No. I would be Swiss in Switzerland. All these gray heights, untrod by foot of man, are peopled with shadows of the past. No wonder the valley Swiss can afford to be even prosaically substantial flesh and blood. Go on, please." "A story of love and truth, Mademoiselle. At all events, that will I make it," he thought. "Long centuries ago, when Love and Truth were young-long enough ago for Love and Truth to have grown old and imbecile, or at the leastfade and out of fashion--a youth and maiden stood together all beneath black pines and blacker skies, in the lone mountain-darkened Finsterwald, as twilight closed around.

Between the palms, clasped still in uncon- scious tenderness of touch, lay, with its silver chain flung loose across his breast, an image of the Virgin. No sound in the silence save that labored breathing, momently faint and fainter, and the boding croak of a raven watching from a blasted pine without. "The lady abbess paced slowly to and fro the ter- race of the blooming convent-garden.

"As she raised it in -her arms and pressed it to her bosom, asbomething cold fell there, and looking down, she recognized with a shudder a small image of the Virgin, and a long silver chain clenched in the raven's claws, all dabbled red in blood. "'Meinrad, O Meinrad! ' she wailed. And she fell forward as one dead, her face buried in the long thick grass. "The nuns rushed to her assistance; but just then there came a knocking at the gates, they were flung wide open by unseen hands, and two men with travel- stained garb and pilgrim staves stood there. "They were bold, bad men, those two. They de- manded alms with fierce gestures and menacing words from those terrified sisters, who shrank back farther and farther, until they were gathered, a frighted flock, around their head. They were bold, bad men; they followed, and at sight of that still prostrate form they pushed on rudely. One stooped to grasp her shoulder, but he staggered back with a yell and a muttered curse that froze upon his stiffened lips.  For there, fluttering up with one continuous boding caw, the raven rose from that cold, still heart, and waved above the ruffians' heads, to and fro, in view of the crowds now pressing in at the gates, the Virgin's image and its blood-stained chain. \.

"A century and a half later, in the Finsterwald, where Heimit Meinrad prayed and died, his kinsman Eber- hard of Hohenzollern founded a convent. The Bishop of Constance journeyed thither to perform the con- secration. But the night before, through all the forest aisles swept the melody of angel choirs, and on the morrow came a message from Heaven that the consecration had been performed. Since then, Pope Leo granted indulgence to pilgrims of Our Lady of the Hermits, and thousands upon thousands go from all middle Europe, so that every breeze from there is freighted with Ave Marias. Quite a pious air the Finsterwald puts on, you may imagine." "What a wild romance! I wonder if all those pil- grims think of it?" "The indulgence is the only part that touches them.

Margaret wondered at their air of shrinking mortification, until Hans pointed out a placard in front, "Duty-forgetting Parents," and explained that this was a time-honored punishment, and that the rod the culprits held in hand was formerly at the disposal of every passer-by. Margaret had little inclination to avail herself of the ancient privilege. She may perchance have felt more for the woman than the woman for herself, for she touched her horse with the whip, and waving to Count Falkenstein, in another instant was before the inn.

For it is the first Sunday after Ascension, and the Forest Cantons are floating down to Fluelen, there to form the procession to Altdorf in honor of Tell, the man whom the Forest Cantons delight to honor.

Where pathless precipices toward the south become more frequent, and boats are the only access from wooded knoll to knoll, the Achsenberg rises in perpendicular ascent from six hundred feet below the surface of the water, to more than six, thousand above. Here, where a ledge of rock, low upon the lake, affords merely a foundation and a few rude steps, amidst clustering shrubs stands Tellis Chapel, a small pavil- ion with open front and slender spire, marking the spot where Tell leaped from the boat that stormy night of his escape from Gessler.

"See," he continued, as the girl, unconscious of being 'the cynosure of neighboring eyes,' fixed her gaze upon the waters steadfastly as Margaret had, "one would hardly find Lurlei-song or Nixie in her reverie. Rely upon it, the price her linen, spun last winter, will bring at the next fair, and how much of that sum may prudently be appropriated for a new ribbon to be worn at the next fete, are the questions pondered as she twists the ribbon of her hat around her fingers." "I don't know," absently began Margaret, then hesitated; "I should like to know how you read- -" "Miss Margaret Ross? but hesitate lest the reader feel called upon to throw in a douceur of compliment?

Self-love and vanity find no place in that fair page, and while faith in good remains, the life-story must flow smoothly on.

As to being the very last person, all the world has gone on laboring upon such edifices ever since the grand failure at Babel proved how none founded on earth may rise to the re- gion of the clouds." "Always excepting Philosopher Lynde," was Mal- garet's mischievous suggestion. "Not excepting Philosopher Lynde. His structure was of good, substantial brick and mortar, far fitter for Grosvenor Square and the habitation of a nine- teenth century gentlewoman. But the woman was not found; and the untenanted mansion, much too weighty for its airy foundations, sank by degrees and fell crumbling away, so that not even the fall thereof was great."  "The woman never found! Did you not then seek too angelic a compound?" "No, and there was the error. I went about, re- versing Diogenes, in search of a woman. Some fem- ininities complainedl loudly of the glare of my torch, and drew down their vails. Some threw them up os- tentatiously, but went closely masked beneath.

A woman found at last-a very woman-good, strong, frail, and faulty." Margaret looked up, interested and questioning, and he laid his hand on hers as it rested on the railing. Perhaps he sighed because of its perfect quietude and her unembarrassed flush of pleased surprise, perceiv- ing that she regarded him a delightful, eccentric mid- dle-aged gentleman, to whom she had taken the great- est fancy in the world.- Perhaps he cast one regret- ful glance back upon his airy ruins. It may be, he wondered at that moment whether, built upon a dif- ferent plan, that structure might not stand, even in the seventh heaven of cloudland. "And your Rose?" said Margaret. "My little Rose is a very child, a winsome, loving, spoiled child. And such I mean to keep her; for woman does not always tread the careless path of children." "Uncle Lynde! Uncle Lynde!" here called the winsome Rose, " if you and Miss Ross do not instantly' come over to us we'll make an inroad upon you.

Each and every one now crowded to the bow, and our party, being first, sthod foremost, beholding the onward road to Altdorf winding through the valley, with mountains towering on either hand; beholding, nearer, the village with its narrow, dingy, ancient streets, its quay, where porters, coachmen, Alpenstocks, student-caps wreathed with evergreen remembrances, gay Parisian hats and flounces, bright-faced ladies, ghastly, dead-white, vacant-staring, purposeless, half- crawling cretins An exclamation from Miss Lynde drew Margaret's attention from all these. -"What is the matter?" she asked, catching her ex- pression of comic distress. "Is that the first cretin you have seen? I don't wonder you are horrified," said Alice, "and-don't look-but how can )that poor creature with a goitre nearly as big as her head above it, make it so con- spicuous by wearing that flashy necklace? I wish some horrid sort of fascination did not compel me to look at them. I have seen only too many, and so will you, Miss Lynde, before you reach Geneva." "Ah bah!" cried the Baroness, who had turned her back, and who was smiling on the quietly observant Polish Count; "for me, I will avert me all days from the d4sagremens.

See, there he is upon the landing, just as if he expected somebody. I know he will be revenged for our giving him the slip at Lu- zern. There I he has recognized us-he moves off- he is coming, I do believe!" "Remember," Margaret reminded, 'your promise to endure him an entire week provided the fates would give him that cold plunge."'

"( You simile is a just one, Mademoiselle. Friend- ship is like yonder lake reflecting thus the evening star. Behold, even now the breeze ruffles the surface of the mirror, and the star is gone." "My simile is not just, Count Zalkiewski. Friend- ship can not change." "And yet when does it not?" "Not friendship. Oftentimes companionship, sim- ilarity of tastes, even mere acquaintance, come to us in Friendship's garb and in her holy name, and when they waver or play us false,- we scoff at Friendship whom, it may be, we have never known." "And what is friendship, then?"Zalkiewski asked. "I will trust no more comparisons of my own. Let Jean Paul answer for me," returned Margaret. "Je- der Freund ist des andern Sonne und Sonnenblume zu- gleich; er zieht und er folgt." 'Jean Paul speaks from his own high heart. How many such are there?" "Is not every heart a sunflower, upon which, if the true sun of friendship shine-not a flickering torch, flaming only while the air around is tranquil, or burn- ing itself out in time, a heap of cold dull ashes-but   INGENISCO.        169 the sun, far above winds and storms and changes--if this shine upon it, will it not turn and follow faith- fully? And if most hearts find their type, not in the delicate heliotrope, but in the coarser sunflower, even these, dark-spotted and rough-grained though they be, are not less true. He cast one passionate glance upon her-a glance which fell unseen, for she was gazing dreamily beyond the steep mountain-side where she, had wandered- upon the lake below, and Lowerz lying in a cove, half seen between the foliage. "Count Zalkiewski," she said, after a pause, raising her eyes with obvious timidity. "For the last week I have sought an opportunity to say to you what I am going to say now, and you have steadily refused it in action and in manner. I speak now, not as I would have done, to secure the friendship I imagined you returned for that which I could not but feel for the saviour of my life, but because I owe it to myself. That night upon Pilatus-in the excitement of the mo- ment and in womanly horror of bloodshed-I usurped what in these latter days is held above the range of woman's province-a peacemaker's. For this an apo- logy is due, and I owe it to myself, therefore, not to explain, but to apologize." He was much moved, and answered hurriedly: "You can not need to do so, Mademoiselle. I am not unjust, and I knew you ignorant of the wrong, the cruel wrong, you did me." "I could not have believed you so revengeful, Count Zalkiewski," she said, in a low tone. "Nor am I.

"I could not think of another before him who saved my life." Silence ensued, during which she rose. "Stay," he said, " and tell me, if I dare ask a great, a passing great boon." "Of me? Any thing in the world." "Grant me back the friendship you once gave." "A question first, Monsieur. All this while--this week--you had determined on relinquishing your friend, and had so reconciled yourself to the loss, that for calm agreeability you could not have been sur- passed?" "I had determined that she relinquished me. I had reconciled myself to fear all loss, save only on one fair morning, one fair fleeting morning-dream. Calm agree- ability! God knows the cost." A brilliant smile lit- up her face. "Then remain my friend," she said, "and there is no boon in the question. Here is my hand upon it, in British fashion." If an impulse thrilled him to press that hand to his lips, to gather to his own that only noble heart which beat for him, albeit but in friendship, he obeyed it not, merely holding for an instant the, unconscious hand.   INGEMSCO.        171 The instant passed, and to Margaret was invisible the officious boy-god who insinuated his own rosy palm into the clasp of friendship. "And now," she said, drawing up her shawl, "the twilight warns me to begone. Two, three stars, be- sides that pale Venus about which we waxed so po- etic. They will begin to think at the ingle-neuk that I have lost myself in these woods, instead of having found a friend." In the- descent of the mountain-side, the Count gathered a tuft of the graceful blue harebell, which he gave to Margaret. "Let this," she said, separating the flowers, and re- turning him a spray, "let this be the sign-floral of our bond.- Should aught of change come between us, may these fairy-bells toll the knell of friendship." As she spoke, she inclosed her blossoms within the double covers of her watch. "I trust," said the Count, while he examined the flowers, "this is no usual gage d'amiti6, else how weary must be these fragile stems of ringing changes upon inconstancy." "Skeptic, beware lest your own breathings of doubt first set the bells in motion. Pray, where did you learn your creed of unbelief?" "Experience is a stern master, Mademoiselle." "But Love and Hope are gentle monitors." "Aly, but they came not to me." "Never?" she asked, and her Voice softened. "Has life always been thus hard, thus bitter?

She colored, but replied frankly: "Well, she does." "She wonders what life-long lesson has made me thus. Does she care to hear it?" "If it do not pain you," she returned. "I will not, make it long, although it goes back thirty-five years for me. "My father, Count Sigismund Zalkiewski,.bore arms for his country under Kosciusko, fought by his side upon the fatal field of Maciejowice, where Poland's fetters were riveted, and was there captured with him. Catherine, who seldom spared an enemy, threw the prisoners into close confinement. Her successor, Paul, liberated the greater number the year following; but my father, whose friends-pardon, Mademoiselle-- whose acquaintances, were lukewarm, and whose ene- mies warm, was not among   the fortunate. It was rumored that he had fallen in battle, and his memory died away from  the memory of those whom  he had loved and served. One only had not forgotten. A peasant maiden, daughter of his serf. She searched the bloody battle-field on the evening of that dread day, braved the ravening wolves that battened on the yet unburied corses, braved the even fiercer soldiery, and finding him not, believed with faith unshaken that he lived.  She went then to his brother and  only near kinsman, told her confidence, implored his aid. He, perchance, incredulous of her tale, perchance moved by fear of losing the thirty pieces of silver, the price of his country's- blood, scornfully dismissed her. But Maida never relinquished her one life-aim. For   INGEMSCO.         173 fifteen years she wandered, even through Siberia's wilds, until she traced the lost one to his fortress-, prison without the gates of St. Petersburg. She be- came servant to his jailer, and at length gained ac- cess to his cell. Fifteen years of weary pilgrimagep had changed the fair young girl into the careworn woman, and fifteen years of solitude and chains had left but little of the gay youth in the man old and gray at thirty-five. Nevertheless, they recognized each other instantly. And if once they had loved with a boy and girl passion, on his part half condescension, on hers half pride in the lover's station, how far deep- er must have been that love, tried by long sorrow, purified from all earthly dross. With the connivance of the jailer's wife, they were married in secret, and despite the wife's incessant labor and the husband's captivity, there was happiness within those dungeon- walls, where I was born. I, and five years afterward a sister. Then all was discovered, and the command- ant denied to my mother access to the fortress. Had she possessed an influential friend, doubtless my fa- ther might have been released. But, friendless, poor, and of lowly station, how could she win a moment's attention from the noble by birth, who recognize only the nobility heralded by decorations and armorial bearings? Thus vainly petitioned Maida.  My faith- ful Zozia, my father's faithful nurse, shared (her trou- bles then, and she has told me the tale, in her own rude way. I can recall her now, my poor mother- her pale face shaded by braids of raven hair, and those dark, patient, wistful eyes, fixed upon the prison-walls, watching for a wan face at a barred window. Thither she daily went, when her labor for our bread was  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7551-00000088"/> 174        INrgMTSCO. over, and sat by the way-side, her arms close about 4 me." His voice trembled. Margaret's arm lay within his, and its unconscious pressure encouraged him to continue: "A year went by, and one night--it lived ever in my childish memory--we were together in our wretch- ed hovel--my mother, Zozia, with my infant sister in her arms, and Hwhen the door was flung wide open, and a man stood within the threshold. Zozia seized a fire-brand, and threw its wavering light full upon the face of the new-comer. And then it was that I saw, face to face, for the first and last time, my father. A man bowed beneath the weight of sorrow, not of years-gray and feeble, for he staggered as he closed the door, and leaned for support against the wall. Yet withal was somewhat noble in his mien, and the -fire of the deep blue eyes was not all gone out. He opened his arms, and my mother, pale as death, rushed into them. Zozia drew me to his feet, and for one moment, and one moment only, I felt the grasp of a father's hand. 'Maida,' he said--and those only words of his I ever heard were forever graven on my memory-- my time is short. I have escaped. Will you sacrifice yourself yet once again for me, and leave your boy--our boy--to Zozia? Moments are life, and we can not fly with both the children.' "I do not remember that my mother spoke, but she turned quickly, and in a moment came again, prepared for the journey.

"' You will care for our boy, our true friend, my mother gasped, taking me in her arms, while the baby. sister crowed in glee, catching at me with her dim- pled hands. "Before God I promise,' Zozia solemnly replied. "As my mother bowed her brow to mine, a long wavy xress, loosed from its braid, drooped against my cheek. I twined it round my fingers, and she mo- tioned to Zozia to cut it off. 6Our Ernst may else forget me,' she moaned. "One long, long, close embrace, a hurried caress from my father, and I had looked my last on both." He paused. Lowerz was reached, and the cottage gate. Margaret's tears flowed fast, and she shaded them from him with her hand. * I distress you. It is too mournful," he said. "No, no. Do not stop now." They passed within the gate and stood leaning upon it, while he resumed: "Zozia took me to her old home on the estate once my father's, then my uncle's. Here I was as other neighboring peasant children, but always held aloof. The shadow of my early childhood yet hung over me, and I dreamed in silence over those faint memories. Two or three years later, two sad letters came to Zo zia; one from my mother, dwelling at first upon my father's brightening prospects, and upon the fond hopes of both that a few months would provide a home for the faithful Zozia and for me. To this was added a short, broken line, telling of the sudden death of my father, who indeed had never recovered from  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7551-00000089"/> 176        .

As he spoke, he placed in Margaret's hand a long dark curl, folded in a worn and faded letter. Mar- garet-raised it reverently to her lips, as might a de- votee the relic of a martyr saint. He watched her, his eyes kindling; then hurried on. "Few weeks only intervened, before another heavy letter came. My mother too, was dead in a foreign land." "And your sister?"Margaret softly asked. "The lady who wrote, a German lady of rank, adopt- ed her, struck- by her rare beauty and winning ways, she wrote. Years ago, when my struggles with the world were at an end, I wrote, claiming her, entreat- ing her to visit me, offering to go for her. I was never answered." She gave him a gentle glance of sympathy. "After that German letter," he continued, "I went to school, thence to college. I more than suspect Zo- zia of having worked upon my uncle's fears, or con- science, or both. She was reputed a weird woman, thought to have dealings with the elfin people. Be that as it may, money was always at my command from the moment my collegiate course began at War- saw. Money, not friends. For the young aristocrats, than whom none was more aristocratically proud than I of my unknown' lineage- looked askance at the stranger, who could revert no farther than to the flor- ins in his purse, for those who made him what he was. And he withdrew within the defenses of his pride, so vigilantly on the defensive, that perchance he courted blows, or parried where none were aimed at him.

Brave Skrzynecki-how we follow, blindly, frantically, shouting the Warsaw hymn, defying death and tyran- ny! Forward, forward--man to man, sword to sword, pike to pike. Night falls, we conquer-but death has conquered us. As our general gave orders to re- treat to Warsaw that night, he echoed sadly Koscius- ko's words: Finis Poloniae. Afterward was the fatal division of our forces at Warsaw, succeeded by capitu- lation., More fortunate than many of my brothers- in-arms, I escaped, an exile. The bitterness of that word, the fierce ensuing combat with poverty and grief, I will not describe. Suffice it to say, men stood aloof from my sinking fortunes, and struggling on alone, I learned to know life a fierce and lonely strug- gle. Five years later, Zozia came to me with what then seemed untold wealth. My uncle had died child- less, and having converted his estates into specie, be- queathed all to me, secretly, through Zozia. Now you have heard my hard and bitter history, do you con- demn me altogether for being hard and bitter too?" "I could not condemn you," she replied, coloring, and hesitating, while he awaited her answer. "But she--your noble mother-she was not." He was silent.

So saying, she sprang down the stairs from the bal- cony, and rapidly traversing the garden path, was wait- ing at the gate when Count Zalkiewski rode up. Harry watched in evident annoyance, as she stood there, shading her eyes with one hand from the bright morning sunshine, while she extended the other first in cordial English greeting to Zalkiewski, and after- ward to receive the richly bound volume he offered. Harry moved restlessly about, with increasing irri- tation, and long before the conference at the- gate ended in a gay au revoir, he had turned abruptly on his heel, reentering the cottage. "Papa wishes to see me alone?

And with vague uneasiness she paced up and down, now and then stopping to twine through the lattice a drooping rose-branch, laden with fragrant clusters. She had not long to wait. Mr. Ross entered, and putting his arm round her, drew her down to the bench beside him. "Troubled, my Daisy?  What is it?" he asked fondly. "Why, do you know, papa, I have been fancying myself your wee Daisy of the olden time, dreading one of your dear old sermons, for text the spiriting away of our Dominie Sampson's spectacles, or the decorat- ing of his sober little pig-tail after the manner of the wild Indians. Have I been a very naughty bairn?" And she looked up at him, archly penitent. "Not a very naughty-only a very foolish bairn." "Why, how? What have I done?" It was some time before Mr. Ross spoke again, and when he did, it was hardly in reply. "The world has grown older, Margaret, in the last half-century, but it is at least an open question wheth- er it has grown in wisdom. I am going to tell you a story of rather more than forty years ago. "'In the fine old library of one of our ancient High- land castles, there were two men advanced in years. Friends they were, for one had thrown his arm across the shoulder of the other, as they, stood there before the fire, awaiting the answer to a summons of the bell. It came almost immediately--so immediately as to appear miraculous, taking into consideration the un- ruffled state-of her cap-ribbons-in the person of a re-   INGEISCO.        181 spectable, middle-aged nurse, bearing in arms a con- fused heap of muslins, and laces, cooings, dimpled fists, and round pink cheeks. The elder of the gentlemen advanced, and scrutinizingly withdrew the laces far- ther from the pink cheeks. "'You say rights friend Mowhray, you say right,' he commented, with an approving pat to the bundle as he came back to the hearth. 'You talk of dying, but you must live to see her the toast among old fogies, such as you and I, the rage among the young gallants. Marry, she bids fair to upset the hearts of the young and the bumpers of the old. Very like her mother, poor lady.' "The other glanced sorrowfully down upon the mourning which he wore, and both turned again to a table at the fartherend of the apartment. There, up- permost among the deeds and papers strewn about, was a freshy-signed will, bequeathing castle this and that, moneys here and there-in short, the entire property of Ronald Mowhray of that ilk, to Matilda, 'sole daughter of his house and heart,' on the con- dition of her marrying, at the age of sixteen, her dis- tant kinsman, son of her father's friend." "Poor thing, poor thing! It is like Jephtha's daughter, papa. Only, it is upon the shrine of Mam- mon that he vows the sacrifice. How can he foresee whether it will be a meek and gentle following lamb, or a proud, passionate, loving, hating woman?" He fiowned, continuing as though uninterrupted: "Years passed, and brought another winter even- ing in that library. In the doorway stands again the elderly serving-woman, scarcely changed.

A moment, and the scene shifts.

And was she not unhappy? Did not her chains gall her to the death?" "She is your mother, Margaret." "Papa, papa, you are not displeased? I never thought of her middle name of Mowhray. But, my own papa," she went on, kissing his hand, "that Jeph- thaismi would not do often. Few could follow so trustfully, so lovingly, as my mamma--still fewer lead like my papa. Depend upon it, if we women, puir fule bodies though we be, rivet not our own fetters, they chafe, be they of iron or the finest gold. It boots not which." "Now you talk indeed like a foolish bairn," he made grave answer. "As if human nature, and nine- teenth century human nature, must needs shut its eyes to the casket which enfolds the gem. Were it nothing, think you, had my Maude-brought up in her seclusion a bride from childhood-at the last flung aside those--fetters, you call them-turned from fa- ther, kindred, home, and country, to follow-for a happy woman does not lead-some foreign-stranger, I would say-far out of sight of all her earliest asso- ciations?

"You love him, have given yourself to him, and yet you daily try him past endurance. Can you not see how, in receiving the attentions of Count Zalkiew- ski, you wound Harry?" The rose in Margaret's hand wore not a deeper flush than that which colored cheek and brow as she lis- tened to her father's words. She crushed the inno- cent flower between her palms, and tore it wrathfully petal from petal. "Has Harry told you this? Has he asked you to say this to me?" she demanded, her eyes flashing. ;"No, my child. Harry's feeling is not of jealousy, but of pain, at your :too apparent neglect." She hid her face on his shoulder, keeping it there while she spoke. "He shall not again be thus pained. But, papa, you have mistaken Count Zalkiewski. Your Marga- ret is no pearl of price to any but to you and Harry. We are friends, nothing more, and never can be more. He has never spoken as if he-cared for me." "Nor looked it, Margaret?" "Nor looked it. You must not let Harry think so. There, he is coming down the walk, equipped for hun- ter's warfare. Papa, don't let him know that you have said this to me." He advanced to the arbor's entrance, but came back with a troubled look, and took her in l-is arms.  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7551-00000093"/> 184        INOJ:MTaCO, "My child, you will surely marry Harry?" he said earnestly. "Papa, papa, I do Believe you want to get rid of me. Don't dream of shaking me off thus. Your Daisy is fast rooted here." She pressed her clasped hands above his heart. "But-if I should'leave my darling? ,If-nay, no tears "-and he kissed away the drops starting to her lowered lashes-" would she not then?" She tried to smile, but her lip only quivered. "Does my darling say yes?" "Yes." ,c Promise me." "I promise," she faltered. When the last farewells were over, and the hunters had departed, she took refuge in her own room, and securing the door, gave way to passionate weeping. ,Wherefore, she herself knew not. She sauntered along the garden path, in meditation over her father's words. It was evening, and the moon gleamed fitfully through fleecy clouds upon her head as on she moved, her hands clasped loosely be- hind. Like a caged animal she paced up and down-a caged fawn long accustomed to its bounds, yet look- ing still from out wild dilating eyes to the distant glimpse of forest haunts, the breezy downs, and free- dom. She felt the straining of the cords that, as she had said, were galling her at last. She looked back upon her past indifference in amazement. How could she have been thus passive month by month, and year   rnGEMSCO.        1 85 by year? Could she ever school herself to that again? Or how had she changed, when naught else had, and Harry was ever so good, so true? With an impatient shrug, she shook herself free from thought, and humming a French chanson, stop- ped before the gate, watching the moon upon the waters, and the light fishing-boats, flitting here and there on sails as silvery white as the moonbeams. And now a shout rang out from boat to boat, awak- ening the echoes and drowning the murmur of the waves. The sound of hoofs clattering along the road roused her from reverie, but not before the horse was sud- denly checked; and throwing the reins loose upon the animal's neck, Count Zalkiewski dismounted. "At this hour for dreams the meetest, may I ask of what Miss Ross is dreaming?" he asked, after she had welcomed and granted him admittance within the wicket. "Not dreaming, only watching the stars. 'I give the first watch of the night To the red planet Mars.'  "The first watch of the night!" he repeated. "How think you-for some, does not the first watch of the night endure throughout all time? For some, is there no light for evermore,: save 'the cold light of stars'?" "Never, never," she made answer earnestly. ' The first watch of the night is a trial-time, and may en- dure but until we -Know how sublime a thing it is To suffer and be strong.'".  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7551-00000094"/> 186         rINGRTIsco. "It may be so. But those words are never meant for such a night as this," .he said more cheerfully, "Theirs rather the midnight when storm winds sweep by, struggling for mastery over dense clouds through the lightning-cleft breach of which Mars glows with ever-unmoved steadfastness. Your poet has described this evening also: 'Beholding the moon rise Over the'pallid sea and the silvery mists of the meadows. Silently, one by one, in the infinite meadows of heaven Blossoms the lovely stars, the forget-me-nots of the angels.' By the way, there are singular criticisms on that last line. Have you a vision of ' an angel with a knot of stars on his breast '?" "Oh! who could dream of that! Rather, does not the poet's heaven-searching gaze discover to him white- winged seraphim in light and snowy clouds like these, hovering in loving care among their blossoms, shining there perpetual forget-me-nots to man-warning and consoling?" After a pause, during which his eyes dwelt on the far away out-look of hers, he asked: "Miss Ross, have you ever been told of your resem- blance to Evangeline?" "Often. But I have no faith in it. Those deep, deep brown eyes-that exquisite expression-nay, no compliment, Monsieur. Mirrors are truthful."' "God defend you ever from the misery of that ex- pression!" There was that in his voice which impelled a hur- ried glance from Margaret. The moon that moment emerging from a cloud, she read in his eyes that which   INGEMSCO.        187 she had never seen before, the deep, tender, passionate love in his soul.  Had her father's question, "nor looked it, Margar- et?" been deferred for but a single day, how different must have been the answer! She shivered. "You are cold. This evening breeze is too chill for you," he said. "Let us go in." The hand she rested on his offered arm, trembled as with cold-trembled as trembled her very heart within her. The'mist was fallen from her eyes. She saw now, and shuddered. That one quick, fiery glance of his had kindled the smouldering fire within, which she had thought but the kindly warmth of friendship. She scorned herself for her falsehood, unwitting though it were, to one who was ever so true to her. What bitter mockery, that tender tie of old companionship, which snapped asunder like silken thread against the fire leaping up against it. But she crushed it down with strong determination. What, though it burn her heart out, die it should-unless- unless-'- Her father only could release her from that rash but -solemn promise--made, however, long ago to Harry May. Would he? Ought she to ask it? But resolutely she put away murmur and question, and ere she gained the balcony, was calm. As she passed into the parlor, she sent Luise with a summons for Alice, She dared not risk encountering another such glance. Luise returning with lights, brought a message from Alice, that her sister would make her apologies to Count Zalkiewski, for she was really tired to death from her morning ramble,  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7551-00000095"/> 188         INGEMTSCO. Margaret could not conceal her annoyance. "Alice is a wayward child," she said to the Count; "and mamma is sleeping after one of her nervous head- aches." She had oontinued standing, in the hope that he would leave her. But he seemed hardly to hear her words, and placed a chair for her at the centre-table. Thus forced to a t6te-a-tete, she sat down, and tak- ing up some embroidery from the table, busied her hands with it, much to its detriment, quite regardless of the scolding she must receive on Alice's discovery of the mischief done. She strove to confine her thoughts to bright silks and graceful pattern, but -they grew indistinct before her, and as the silence became oppressive, with an effort she raised her eyes. To meet his fixed upon her in the same strange gaze. Confused and blushing, she began to talk, scarcely conscious of the subject until his reply startled her. "Yes, I had learned the departure of the Baroness and suite. You meet at Baden very -soon, they say. And I, may I follow you there?"  He had pushed aside the portfolio of engravings before him, and now leaned: forward, reading her face. The keen questioning of his gaze, and a tremor in the low deep tones made her instinctively aware that in her answer lay his fate and hers. Her eyes fell till the lashes quivered upon her pale cheeks,- her white lips parted, almost with a gasp, and slowly, hesitat- ingly, she spoke: "I--we-- It would not be worth your while, our stay may be so short. That is, if you considered being with us. And it is not exactly the Baden season, is it?" she added, with forced calmness, very like coldness.   INGEMSCO.        189. Zalkiewski's :brow darkened. She went on hur- riedly: "I trust we shall very soon be again in Scotland. I am weary, weary of a roving life, and will never, nevermore leave Ross-shire, I think. There is my fate, you know--" and she laughed a short, hard laugh. "Harry May's estate joins ours, and we have been bound, betrothed, from childhood." She kept her eyes upon her work, of which her little trembling fingers were making irretrievable ruin. When at last she did venture to look up, his sun- browned face was pale even to the firm-set lips. But he was quite calm, and his gaze followed a dusky moth fluttering round and round the candle, upon the table on which he leaned. "Poor fool!" he said bitterly, while the insect hov- ered nearer and nearer; " it sees the danger, the cer- tain doom, in lingering here; yet it persists-it can not go." He took the tiny, quivering, singed creature in his hand. Margaret rose and held out hers for it. "To what purpose?" he asked, looking up earnest- ly. "Would you put it out of its misery?  Then crush it here. It will come back and back to the beautiful light that glows not for it, until it perish." Her voice sank, but she replied steadily, meeting his full gaze: "It shall not destroy itself. It must go out into the quiet night, and forget the poor light of the little candle in the high radiance of stars." She took the moth, but it wheeled from her hold, over the flame once again, before it was captured. "You see, it would sot go. Do not put it out into  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7551-00000096"/> 190        INGTEMSCO. the cold dark night. It cannot see the stars. Let it stay; it is seared already; what matter if it burn it- self to death?" He spoke, pleading as if for his own life or death. But she turned away without reply, and put the moth out at the window, which she closed against it. As she yet delayed there, her burning brow pressed against the cool glass, he came to her side. He took her pas- sive hand.  "I am going," he said, low and passionately, while she moved not, nor turned toward him; "I shall come here no more. But you will not be angry, will you, if I do not go away; if I stay where I may sometimes see you? It will be for so short a time?" Her answer was slow in coming, very faint and tremulous in utterance. "Would it not be better " "To see you no more? I know all that you would urge. I can not. I am like your poor, foolish moth," he said, with a bitterness that struck Margaret to the very soul. Then he began again quietly: "I can not thank you for your warning, but I do thank you for your sweet, your heavenly sympathy. Keep still some friendship for me in your heart. And now farewell- my Margaret-my darling-my only love." He grasped both her hands. The next moment the quick strokes of Ostrolenka's hoofs struck upon her heart.   XH. "  Ta air is full of farewells to the dying And mournings for the dead." "You walk late, Miss Ross." She turned, recalled from thought so absorbing that she had been deaf to the sound of hoofs approaching. Count Zalkiewski dismounted and walked beside her, leaving Ostrolenka to follow. All this week he had not visited the cottage, and Margaret, awaiting her father's coming in suspense, daily more and more harassing, had avoided any for- tuitous rencontre. But this evening, weary of inac- tion, she had wandered out in the sunset, looking with anxious yet fearful expectancy down the road by which the hunters must return. Her color came and went, and her voice trembled, is, not daring to meet his eyes, she replied, pausing na her walk: "Yes, I have strolled later than I intended. I hoped o meet my father on his way home, but it is so late hat I must go no farther." He turned back with her. The mention of her father, which he construed as ntended to convey the remembrance of the absent  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7551-00000097"/> 192        CoESCO. successful lover, doubly armed his pride, and therefore was his manner the cooler when he spoke again. The scenery, the beauty of the evening, Mrs. Ross's health, were the topics he for a few moments pursued. 'Then he inquired, in a matter of-course way: "And when is Lowerz to lose you? Have you formed definite plans?" "No," she replied, "not definite. We are waiting for my father's return." And the Count, as she could not resist glancing up to see, listened with the air of courteous concern of a mere acquaintance. The indignant blood mounted to her brow. Her pride, too, aroused. In his presence now, that evening was unsubstantial as a dream. She was ready to be- lieve that she had deceived herself-had given undue weight to phrases of mere gallantry. However that might be, the conviction flashed upon her that he did not love her now. And, stung to the soul with shame and self-scorn, she made the quick resolve to crush out every heart-throb to which his heart no longer answered. She lifted her head, and shrank no longer from his eyes. Gayly she smiled and talked, unembarrassed as himself. She dropped her glove as she walked, and turning back for it, caught sight of a solitary horseman riding slowly and dejectedly up the road. She looked--then with a low cry stood-:till. She had recognized Harry. Zalkiewski spoke to her--she did not hear-again and again, and still no answer. He touched her, alarmed. She started, and her white lips parted in a hoarse whisper. "My father, my father, he is not there."   r INEMSCO.       193 He drew nearer lest she should fall, she was so ghastly with unutterable terror. But he did not speak, did not venture to comfort or to reassure her; what was he to her that he should intrude upon the sacred presence of her grief? It was indeed Harry. When he came near, and saw Margaret's face, he sprang from his horse, and hastening to her, drew her arm within his own. Count Zalkiewski, unheeded by both, drew back. Margaret fixed her burning eyes upc a Harry. There was no evading them. Reply he must, although the rigid lips could scarcely form the words. "I know--I know-but is he yet alive?" "No--my own-my poor Margaret!" One, watching, saw that dear head droop upon another's shoulder, saw another's arm supporting her, another bend his lips close to hers, to murmur words of consolation he would gladly die for the right to- breathe. None saw the strong man stagger against that pine-d tree for support. None saw him stoop for and treasure next his heart a little trampled glove, raised from the dust, where it had lain beneath a horse's hoofs--poor castaway from another's store of love.  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7551-00000098"/> rXIV. "E COMB quei che con lena affanata Uscito faor del pelago alla riva Si volge all' acqua perigliosa e guata- Cosi lanimo mio, che ancor fuggiva, Si volse 'ndietro a rimirar lo passo." "A  PiENNY for your thoughts, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance," and Margaret, herself wan and pale in her deep mourning dress, laid her hand, with an attempt at playfulness, on Harry's shoulder. - He turned from the window, whence he had been looking out upon the lake, where the waves were dull and leaden as the rainy heavens above.   He caught her hand, while her lashes drooped before his gaze, and she grew even paler than before. "Margaret," he began, "I have that to say, which in my weakness has been perhaps too long deferred. Months ago, even before our loss, I should have spok- en. Will you hear me now?" She did not speak, but simply bowing her head, moved to the sofa, and motioned him to the seat be- side her. After a moment, he broke the silence. "Listen, Margaret.   Hear me now, as if I were only the friend Harry of by-gone days, and had no nearer,   INGEMSCO.        195 no dearer claim on your forbearance." He faltered, but with a strong effort resumed: "When you first gave me your troth, Margaret, the knowledge of my unwo(rthiness cast no chill upon my joy. But since, a fear, which vainly I thrust from me, returns ever more and more urgent .to be heard. For many weeks I dared not face it, but to-day I bring my fear, my hope, my life, and leave the issue in your hands. You have given me the right to call you mine. But, Margaret, I would have you truly mine. I will shrink no longer from the possibility that the dream of love may have deluded me, and that in reality the unmeasured, undeserved gratitude your generous heart accords, and the old dear friend- ship, urge you to bind yourself with a bond that may prove iron to your soul. If it be so indeed, if you shrink and tremble before the future, do not hesitate to speak freely to the Harry of old. We will forget all after days. Nay, hear me out, dear one. I have never dreamed you love me as others might exact. But if your heart fail not from life's long battle at my side, then, my own love, my own Margaret, fear not to come to me. My love shall be your firm defense, and your dear friendship shall bear me on to gain even your love." He ceased. Long since she had dropped her face upon the arm of the sofa, and he could only mark the hurried breathing agitating her frame. She was far away in the past. She saw two child- ren wander hand in hand among the mountain-passes of her own Scotland. She saw them together play. ing or reading from the same book, beneath the oak- grove's sunny shades; or together around the broad  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7551-00000099"/> 196        INGsEMSCO. hearth heaped with blazing fagots, listening with rapt attention to wondrous tale of brownie or of daring border-chieftain. And with a rush of tenderness she remembered how gentle to all her childish caprices was the Harry of old. Yet another scene; although she pressed her hand upon her eyes to shut it out. A fearful Alpine gorge, miles distant. A bruised and mangled form lying helpless, far down the rocky steep. And the Harry of to-day, who had risked his life in the descent, bend- ing over, and when the last breath had been gasped painfully away, bearing the lifeless body up the same perilous way. And in her memory were written those last faintly-scrawled words by the hand of that dying man: ' My darling, be your mother's comfort and support. Sustain her now that I am no more beside. Your promise gives me peace in death. Keep it as you value my dying blessing. God comfort and bless my Margaret." Could she hesitate? If she might but make him happy! She considered not " how bitter a thing it is to look at happiness through another man's eyes," but thinking only of him, said: "I will leave you to judge, Harry. If, after hear- ing what I have to say, you still will have it so, I am yours." She waited, gathering resolution, then went on in choking, painful gasps: "God knows how hard it is to say, I have-loved. You can not take, in tak- ing mine, an untouched heart. But I have struggled strongly, and I think, I trust, have conquered. Do not despise me, Harry; I thought--I thought-he loved me."   INGEMSCO.        197 With a wild burst of weeping, she hid her face. Neither jealousy nor amazement made him for one instant forgetful of her. His arm was round her, and drew her head down to his shoulder. He soothed her into calmness with his gentle, tended words. Then he met her timid glance in mournful steadiness. "But he does love you, Margaret. He must love you. You shall not sacrifice yourself," he said, his mind wandering in doubt among her numerous ac- quaintances. "No, no, he cares not for me. And I love no long- er. I am no suppliant for his kindness," and she rais- ed her head proudly. "But, Margaret  " "I tell you, Harry, were he now to feel for me what I once dreamed he did, I would not hear him. Never, never!" She rose and,moved toward the door. Harry fol- lowed, laying a detaining touch upon her -arm. "Margaret," he said, his voice tremulous with yearn- ing tenderness, "you have said you will tot love one. Would it grieve you to receive the life-long love of another?" She turned, and in his sheltering arms her weary heart found rest.                      .  .  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7551-00000100"/> XV. Hlar.--Ws may not part. Gun.--Ay, though our severed hearts bleed e'en to death. This may we not-we may not break our faith, May not in life's stern warfare recreant turn, And, trembling, flee the battle." THEY were together in the cottage parlor--the mother and daughters-Mrs. Ross reclining upon the sofa, her closed eyelids heavy with slowly gathering tears; Margaret on a low seat by her side, her work fallen in her lap, her gaze bent absently upon- the floor; Alice at the window, intent upon a guide-book. 'A shadow rested on every face-the shadow Death leaves behind where he has been. The passing sun- shine of a smile may flicker there, but the shadow surely darkens after. "Mamma," said Alice, flinging back her drooping curls, " what day shall we leave Lowerz? When does Jeanie write she will be at Baden, Margaret?" Margaret drew a letter from her work-basket, un- folding it as she replied: "About the first of September. That-let me see- that is Wednesday next. Do you not think, Mamma, we should begin our journey the day after to-morrow?   INGEMSCO,        1 99 Jeanie's letter is dated from Vienna, you know, and she could hardly fail to reach Baden before us." "Poor Jeanie! So she has received none of our letters;" sighed Alice. A mournful silence ensued. "Then," at last exclaimed the restless Alice; "in two days we shall look our last upon Lowerz. Do you know, Mag, I used to think we could nher get you back to Scotland, your Polar bear had so won- drous a longing to carry you off to his mountain-den. He has it still, I verily believe, for when we had passed himn in our walk last evening, he looked back, and sch a look I Even my vanity could not appropriate, passing as it did quite over my head. Nay, you need not blush, for if the Count does think you a naughty ffirt, you who first found his lost heart have certainly the right to use it as you will." If Margaret had blushed, she was now pale enough. Mrs. Ross watched her anxiously. Sad and abstracted as was the face before, was there now an appalling terror, an agony of dread, that smote upon the moth- er. "Can it be possible," was her involuntary self- questioning, "that she does not love Harry?" "Darling," she said, passing her hand caressingly over her daughter's hair; ,Clay aside your work and go take a walk or a ride. Your roses only bloom in the fresh air."' Margaret started, then brushing her palm across her brow, she rose, and moving as one in a dream, put away her work. Passing her mother's sofa, she stoop- ed and left a lingering kiss upon her forehead. Then without a word quitted the room. "Alice, your sister is not well," said Mrs. Ross.  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7551-00000101"/> 200        TINGMTSCO, "Follow, and ask if you shall go out with her. I must have time to think," she soliloquized. "But Herbert-he thought for her-he must be right." But Margaret refused Alice's offer, and went out alone. Swiftly she rode, to escape pursuing thoughts. On and on, caring not whither, till she found herself at the foot of the wooded hill, where one happy evening had bel vowed a friendship already how changed! A bridle-path wound up the steep and skirted the lake, until precipitous hills towered into mountains, rang- ing north .to Zug. A more sequestered resting-place she could not find, and an impulse led her onward to the spot where that broken bond was formed. She threw herself upon the turf, and tossing aside her broad-brimmed hat, looked round as one taking a lin- gering farewell of an old friend's face. Two months ago she had been there for the first and only time. Since then, the forests had begun to don their gayest holiday attire in honor of approach, ing autumn. Crimson, gold, and purple gleams were on the lake, and higher up, beech and maple threw a sunset glory against the lofty gloom of pines. Far more altered than the world without, was the world within. She thought with passionate grief of the dark change in herself, which darkened all the sunshine. She wept, she prayed. Moments might have passed, or hours, while she struggled thus reso- lutely with her heart. Formerly, she had shunned reflection-had yielded, passive, to fate. Now she weighed,. and calmly after a while, each dread or hope, desire or fear, and judging between them, turn- ed away from bright young Love, and cried to Duty, / Be thou my guide!   INGEMSCO.        201 Faint and worn, but strong now in the strength of right, she was rising to go, when a thought occurred to her, and bpening the case of her watch, she drew forth the withered blossoms he had, given. She touch- ed them tenderly, lovingly, while she drew them forth, then crumpled them in her hands and flung them from her, slowly and deliberately, one by one. It was as if tearing away those chords in her heart which thrill- ed to their associations. "Why are you destroying my flowers?" Blushing painfully, she cast down her eyes. She knew that Count Zalkiewski stood beside her as he had stood that evening long ago. "I come," he said, "a pilgrim to the shrine of. Friendship, and lo! his priestess ruthlessly destroys his offerings." Margaret, stung by his tone, raised her eyes. But she read in his that which belied the mocking words. "You judge aright, he said again bitterly. "These are no ties of friendship. You do well to cast away, with my love, these its worthless tokens. Still no reply from the parted, quivering lips. "Nay, but you must speak to me. I can not bear this. Margaret, have you no mercy? Will you part from me without one breath of hope, of comfort? I have striven to be calm, to\be proud, but come to you at last, a mere weak suppliant. A few short days, and you are gone. Shall I see you nevermore? Have I no hope, none?" She turned upon him a white, grief-stricken face. "Hush, hush," she moaned, "you may not speak  thus to me, I may not listen." . She lifted herself up wearily. But all earth grew  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7551-00000102"/> 202        LGEMSCO. black before her, and. she staggered, blindly stretch- ing forth her hands for support. He grasped them and forced her, dizzy with the whirl of emotion, to rest against his shoulder. His very touch thrilled her pulses, and a flush dyed her cheek crimson. Still retaining her hands in his firm, strong clasp, he drew her to her seat, throwing himself at her feet. For an instant neither spoke nor moved, until she resolutely withdrew her hands. He released them, intent upon her face, over which varying emotions swept with her changing color. At length, with slow determination, hie spoke: "Margaret, you love me. By those eyes' dear light I know it, and knowing it will never give you up. Speak not to me of bonds! What is so strong a bond as love? What so holy? What so eternal? You can not, you dare not, resist it! Mine is no light love, Margaret. None ever before held by another, none that may ever find repose in another. No love of the senses, though you are very fair to me, and your voice, your steps even the touch of your dress in passing, thrill me wildly. No love that may perish or grow cold. Have I not vainly struggled against its hopeless- ness since that hour on the mountain, wherein I recog- nized your noble woman nature? You have given me another life, warm, glowing, loving-faith in truth and virtue, hope. Will you shut me out from this life of love, crush me back to that despair? Will you, can you, Margaret?" She had not once looked at him during this appeal, but now she raised her mournful eyes, and her voice was firm, as she replied: "I will, I can do what is right to do. Hear me,   -vINGMSCO.       203 help me. I have told you how my faith is pledged. You have seen that he is good, true, noble-hearted. But you do not know that the day before my-my father-" her lip trembled, and tears gathered 'slow- ly, "went on that fatal journey to Uri, I vowed a solemn vow- to keep my troth-pli'ght. You have doubtless heard how Harry periled his life to bear me his dying words. But you know not what they were. These--my promise gave him peace in death, and as I value his dying blessing, even so must I fulfill my promise. Toward you I have been guiltless. Not so toward Harry. I never dreamed that you-I thought you my friend only--until that evening- after my promise." "Tell me," he cried, (' if you had known, would you have given that promise." "It matters not now," she replied, averting her head. "CThere is now but one course for me. In your noble heart you know it." There fell silence so intense that each might hear the quick breathing of the other. Then Count Zalkiewski rose and turned away with folded arms, and eyes bent upon the ground. "Go," he muttered hoarsely.: "Go. You are very just and good. But you have never loved, Margaret." She went to him, and laid her hand beseechingly upon his arm. "I must -indeed go," she said, "but I can not leave you thus. Ah! let us not part in anger! If it com- fort you in aught, I will confess that-I love you, Ernst. And if it make the cup of sorrow sweeter to you, know that H, a weak girl, have drained it to the bitter dregs.

She looked into his eyes fearlessly, although the color mounted to her brow. And those eyes at length yielded to the eloquence of hers. "Brave, true heart," he murmured. "God forbid that I should make thee false!" He held out his hand and she laid hers in it. One lingering clasp, and they were parted. Margaret hurried on, crushing back all thought, all feeling, daring not to pause, until, loosing her horse to mount, she discovered that her hat -had been for- gotten on that well-remembered bank. She retraced her steps perforce, venturing not to look up, lest in his descent she should see him whom she only prayed to see no more. For her courage was giving way before the blank future. She threaded that labyrinth of trees, shrubs, and rocks, overawed, she knew not why, by its complete isolation from even the lonely road, only visible here and there far, far below. And she passed again beneath the towering cliff.     * Ay, there he was, leaning upon the rock against which -she had leaned, his arms crossed upon it, his head bowed down, his strong frame quivering with voiceless sobs, the fearful agony of the strong. Motionless she stood, an image of despair, cheek and lip bloodless as marble. Her misery--her future -how sunk to nothingness it was! His, so desolate when she was gone! She could not go away, she had no power to move, no power to think what brought her there, though the hat lay at her feet. And impa. tiently at length he lifted his head.   INGEMSCO.         205 "Margaret!" The command, the entreaty, the passionate love the word conveyed, thrilled her into new life. Com- pelled-by the stronger will, she threw herself into his outstretched arms. Closely, closely, they enfolded her. Quick, burn- ing kisses were showered upon brow and eyelids, while she lay mute and passive there. One hand of his clasped her, while with the other he put back the long bright tress which, fallen from the confining comb, rip- pled over her flushing cheek and gleamed golden in the sunshine. "My darling, you are come back to me." As one awakened from a dream, she started. She shivered, and her eyes unclosed with a wild and trou- bled gaze upon him. "I had forgotten--I had forgotten- O my father; forgive me!" she moaned, struggling to free herself. "My Margaret, you would not leave me?" She laid her hands upon his shoulders, and looked into his eyes, earnestly beseeching. "If you love me, Ernst, you will release me. Would you have me lose my father's blessing! WTould you have me lie to God? I can not. I will not. Think you I suffer less than you? That my love is weaker than yours? It is strong to bear all things in its trust in your honor, your nobleness, your truth. Is your love less than mine, that you care not for my honor?" He could not meet her gaze as he replied: ( Your words, are vain.; I will never, never let you go, without your promise to be my wife." 'That promise I will never give. Ernst, Ernst. God help us both, it is too late "   &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7551-00000104"/> 206        INrEw9IsCO. "It is not too late. It shall not be too late." And he clasped her yet more closely. "'How dare you," she cried, drawing back with flashing eyes. "Am I then sunk so low? Let me go, lest I hate you." He withdrew his arms. She trembled before the angry flush upon his brow, the relentless fire in his eyes. His nostrils dilated and his mouth was rigid when he spoke. The words, hardly louder than a whisper, were yet terribly distinct. "We are parted no more.   I swear it. You go hence with me as my wife, if you will. Give me your word of honor to ride with me now to Schwyz, to marry me there this morning, rescue or no rescue. Refuse, and what eye shall trace your way through these mountains to my castle in Zug-what ear hear your cry for aid--what arm tear you from me there?" "You will not dare--" she gasped. "You know that I will dare. A  man desperate as I, dares any thing. Your promise. For you are ut- terly in my power. You can not hope to escape me." She sank as if struck down by a sudden-blow. She was powerless. So long, unconsciously, had her mind bowed itself to the sway of his, that it knew not how to stand erect, defiant. The god she had looked up to reverently, reliantly, was fallen, shattered, from that altitude, into depths of darkness lower than her shrinking gaze could fathom. Her strength fell with the ruin, crushed and broken. It was the ruin of the universe-the past, the future-earth an abyss and heaven a void. She did not think, she did not-will. She felt her- self in the clutch of Fate, a poor shred, which the hag   INGEMSCOo        207 broke off from the tangled skein of life, and cast away at the mercy of any shifting wind. For the winds all shifted since chaos reeled before her, and the good and the true were no more. At length a hand touched hers, clenched together. She drew back, shuddering, and raised her head, bow- ed the while upon her knees. Her eyes met his, pas- sionate as before, but determined withal. She threw herself upon her knees before him, weep- ing. She prayed for mercy, she begged only a little time. But glancing up through blinding tears at last, she read an iron resolution in: his averted face. She knew then that pleading was vain. She rose up scorn- fully. "You require my word of honor," she said; -" my honor is gone for evermore with yours. But my prom- ise, which with my own will I never break, I give you. Take with it my utter contempt." She swept past him, and refusing with a gesture his assistance, mounted her horse. Side by side they rode on, exchanging neither word nor glance, until the road to Schwyz lay before them. Then Margaret suddenly reined in her horse and turn- ed to Ernst. "You did not really mean it," she cried. "Ah Ernst! tell me that you did not! You meant but to try me--or I have misunderstood you. You are no- ble yet, and true, my Ernst." She smiled upon him through her tears. He would not look at her. He muttered: "Your promise, Margaret." The light died instantly from her face. Her eyes glittered as she almost hissed between her teeth:   &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7551-00000105"/> 208        INrCTOrSCO. "Then I shall hate you." He did not- reply, and she urged on her horse faster than ever. The few peasants they met upon the road stopped and looked after them admiringly. At a cot- tage door, as they passed, sat a buxom maiden at her spinning-wheel, and envied the gay lady with her gal- lant cavalier. None marked her white, white face, and restless eye, nor the scorn upon her lip. These changed not, when before the holy altar the priest blessed this mockery of marriage. Mechanically- Margaret had gone through the ser- vice, scarce conscious of what was done or said. When the ring was on her finger, and husband and wife stood alone in the presence of God, united for- ever, yet how  divided, she waved Ernst aside, and without a word entered the carriage waiting before the church.'; It was a light barouche, with seats for only two, and as Ernst took the reins, Margaret shrank back in her corner. "To Lowerz?" he asked. "To Zug," she answered, without looking at him. He drove rapidly, still much excited. Gradually the flush faded, his eyes lost their unnatural brilliance and a dark and heavy gloom succeeded. He looked at his bride. She was leaning back with closed eyes which now and then opened 'to note the distance-- never by any chance to rest on him. He did not venture to speak to her. He began to fear she could indeed hate him. He began to hate 1himself for his ungenerous, cruel act. Most unlike bride and bridegroom were the two who descended from the carriage at Egeri Castle.   INGEMTSCO.        209 No proud welcome, no tearful smile, but silently to- gether they entered the cloisters. There Margaret hesitated. She pressed her hand to her brow, bewildered. "There is something I must do-I do not know- I can not think," she murmured. Ernst turned aside. Intense remorse convulsed his features. After an instant, he said gently: "Will you write?" She bowed assent. He led the way to the library, and placing for her a chair at a writing-table, laid writing materials be- fore her. She rested her brow upon her hand, and began to write. Slowly at first, and presently her pen stopped, and she sat gazing down vacantly upon the paper. These words, in faltering characters, caught Ernst's eye: "Mother, I am-dead  " He drew the paper gently away, replacing it by another. He took the pen which she had dropped with the ink yet undried, added the date, and threw the sheet into a desk upon the table. "Margaret, you have not written," he said then. She resumedthe pen, and staying to collect her thoughts, wrote rapidly. When she had finished she pushed the paper toward him. He read, obeying her gesture: "Mother, I am married. I dare not ask your for- giveness. I dare not call myself now your child.

He had expected her to tell all, and because she did not, he thought she had forgiven all He extended his hand across the table. But she drew back. 'Count Zalkiewski," she said, with quiet decision, rising and standing erect, "between you and me there can be henceforward nothing more than the more bond of ceremony. A bond, cold and hard in- deed, but of your own imposing. As I warned you of that before, I now warn you never again to forget the past-the past of to-day, I would say," she added, while a sudden spasm contracted her mouth, "any other past is forever past to me. The protection of your house you owe me now. The outward respect of a wife I owe you. More I can not give-more you will not require-I have yet so much confidence in you. Each has a separate burden, equally heavy, perhaps, and each must bear it separately. One in name, we are more widely parted by your own deed than by eternity of time or distance. But words are vain, we both know all too well." She laid her hand upon the note. "You will have the goodness to dis- patch this." Ernst rose also. "You must allow me to send an explanation of- of-  You must permit me to tell your mother all She can not censure you." She looked at him in surprise, replying proudly:   INGaMSCO.        2" iYou are my husband. If my heart and yours hold a secret which, revealed, would throw contempt upon the name I bear, they only shall hold it unto the end. That little part of a wife's duty, I, God help me, can perform." Voice failed, and she sat down, covering her face. He strode up and down the room in great agitation. Those bitter words found too true an echo in his con- science for aught of anger to awaken.- His thought was of her when he came and stood beside her, bend- ing over yet not offering to touch her. "Can you never forgive?  Could you know my anguish, my remorse, surely you would have some compassion. I would that I had died before this day. I would, even, that I should live a lingering death without you. Margaret, you shall go home to your mother, or I depart, an exile from your presence-any, thing to bring back the smile to your lips, the light to your eyes again. Only tell me what you will, and, I beseech you, let your last word to me be of forgive- ness." His passionate words moved her not. She lifted her face. There was no relenting. "What is done, may never be undone. Can you give me back my dead father's forfeited blessing? Can you restore faith in one whom I believed all noble? Can you give back the warm) the loving nature that was mine but yesterday? Idle now to think of what has been-idle and maddening," and again with a troubled look she pressed her hand upon her brow. "But my mother shall not think scorn of him whom I would reverence. Here is my home, since the marriage-vow is spoken.

You ask me to forgive. I know not what is forgiveness. If it be a struggle to keep from hate, from detestation, you have it. It may be that in time I shall have so crushed down the bitterness, the horror, that overpower me at your approach, that I may learn to regard your presence or your absence with indifference. But in word or deed come not again between me and my mother. You have divided--you can not unite. By the wrong you have done me, I conjure you, attempt it not. And now, pardon that my words have been unwife-like. Never again shall you hear word of re- proach from my lips. I have been thus explicit that I might not deceive you, nor you yourself. Hencefor- ward, let the past be not once named between us." She rose. - Ernst opened the door for her, and sum- moning old Zozia, quietly introduced Margaret as his wife, with orders to attend upon her. Then, listening until the foot-falls ceased upon the stairs, he reentered the library, alone with his remorse. /    J   "An life is thorny; and youth is vaind And to be wroth with one we love, Doth work like madness in the brain." THE morrow, clear and bright, seemed but a bitter taunt to those whose morrows, farther than either dared to look into futurity, were so hopelessly clouded. Margaret presided at the breakfast-table with a calmness and dignity the result of a sleepless night's struggles. Ernst, on the contrary, was absent and restless, flushing whenever she addressed him in her icy-clear tones, and answering oftentimes at random. There could be little conversation, of course; few sub- jects from which both did not secretly shrink back, as upon the verge of some fearful chasm of memory. While they lingered at table, Ursin entered to say that the Countess's maid had arrived from Lowerz, and had been shown up-stairs to the boudoir. Margaret stood up as the servant went away.  She held by her chair, breathing hard and changing color with such frightful rapidity, that Ernst sprang for- ward to support her. But her involuntary shudder at his approach repelled him, and he drew back while she, strongly mastering her agitation, moved away to thedoor.  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7551-00000108"/> 214        XIN GtliSCO. He, too, moved as if to follow. But the impulse was instantly checked, and up and down he strode, listening, at every distant sound, for her returning footsteps. In vain. Meantime, Margaret had traversed the cloisters slowly, dreading to find reality yet more terrible than suspense. She paused with her hand upon the lock of her door, then opened hurriedly. Luise came forward as her mistress entered, and kissed with warm devotion the extended hand. 1"Did you not bring me a letter, a note?"Margaret's quivering lips could with difficulty falter. "None, dear Fraulein-gracious Countess, I would say. But Miss Alice packed your trunks herself, and , she might have put one in," she hastened to add, alarmed by the ghastly change in Margaret's face. "The trunks are in here, my lady," opening, as she spoke, the door into the dressing-room. "One moment," Margaret rather gasped than said. "Are they going away-soon?" "To-morrow, I believe; Frau Alison was packing when I came away." "Very well," Margaret forced herself to say. "I will unpack, myself, Luise, and will call you when I want you." The door closed between, she began with feverish impatience to examine her trunks, unfolding and shak- ing every article, lest perchance the letter might escape her. An undirected envelope lay in the tray of the last trunk she opened. She broke the seal. Inclosed was a large sum of money-her usual yearly allowance. That was all. When at length the search had been repeated, at   ING-MSSco.         215 first carefully, afterward despairingly, and the floor around was strewn with the contents of her trunks- delicate dresses, costly shawls, laces, jewels, books, heap- ed together in confusion-she yet knelt there, stunned. Anger she had looked for-forgiveness hardly hoped. But to be cast off thus-to receive no hastily written line, even of rejection, in the trembling strokes of which her wistful eyes might have discovered some relenting-oh! that was too cruel, her heart clamored until she remembered how wicked to her mother, hers no longer, must seem the broken promise, the light' faith, the disregard of her father's dying words. What wonder that the wrath surgmg up against her husband had need of icy bonds to keep it under? After a time, she began listlessly to turn over her books one by one. It seemed such a weary while since she had touched them last. These, from her father, " to his wee Daisy," she could not bear to look at, but rose -and laid them reverently apart. Those from Harry, over whose signature she lingered ten- derly before arranging them upon a table near. One, her cheek flushed as she took it up, a copy of Faust- the name in it, Ernst I. Zalkiewski. Vividly before her thronged its associations. 'The rose-wreathed ar- bor with its vista of the lake, where Ernst and she had read together so many of those pages. That last, short morning, when he had explained to her a dif- ficult phrase. She found the place. It was marked by a withered rosebud, and a slip of paper fell from between the leaves-a translation he had written for her of passionate words of Faust-words that now as she read this other, Margaret felt were not written for her eye alone, but for her heart to ponder.  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7551-00000109"/> 216        INGEMSCO. She gazed fixedly upon that bold, free hand, writing she would have known among a thousand. She had thought it characteristic, and she felt it so still. To her, looking upon those lines for the first time, it was as if chancing upon the writing of a loved one dead long since, with years of misery between. And she hid away the volume, that no hand save hers might ever touch it. A little time-worn prayer-book next, thrown down open at the title-page. Within, a childish scrawl: "To sister Madge, from Ailie." The words were dimmed by time, but beneath each was drawn a fresh line, of which the Ink was newly dried, and at the end a blot--perhaps a tear fell there. Margaret knew at once that Alice, commanded not to write, had chosen this means to assure her sister of her unchanged lovei Again and again was the page pressed to Marga- ret's lips. But still there came no weeping. Only the tearless eyes glittered more fiercely:. The day had closed, and sunset died away in the gloaming, when a dark figure emerged from the east- ern tower, and gliding, looking neither to right nor left, across the lawn, began rapidly the descent of the winding stairs in the rock. Midway, another step ascending might have been heard. But the dark ladye heard nothing, saw noth- ing, until a surprised "l Margaret!" greeted her, and she stood face to face with Ernst. "Go away," she cried vehemently, stamping her foot. "I will not be stopped. I will go. Don't dare to touch me--I hate you." But he passed his arm around her, as she would   INGEMSCO.        2 7 have sprung by him, down the steps. At her words he turned pale, but still held her, vainly struggling, in his strong clasp. "You shall go, Margaret9 "lingelring over the name with thrilling tenderness; "but not thus. Hate me you may--and I deserve even that--but I have a hus- band's right to guard you. You shall go home, now, immediately, but you can not go alone. Suffer me to take you there, and then if you-O Margaret, if you could but find it in your heart to say, 'I forgive,' before we part forever," Releasing her, he stood gazing upon her as if for the last time. She laughed a scornful, mocking laugh. "Oh! we'll not part forever. No fear of that," and with a rush of desolate feeling, she remembered how  a. he had closed against her any door other than his. "I am only going to Lowerz, -on a short visit. If you will go, order the horses while I wait here." She seated herself upon the steps. Ere long, Ernst was driving her rapidly over the road to Lowerz. She leaned forward, gazing wistfully on through the darkening twilight' shadows, growing gloomier as they entered the stately forest arches. She was wholly absorbed in impatient longing, and did not speak until the lake of Lowerz lay faintly radiant be- fore, the village lights gleaming among the trees, re- flected red upon its surface. Then she turned to Ernst. "You must go no farther," she said. "Remain here, and I will detain you but a moment. I shall be quite safe now. I thank you for coming." She had recovered the calm coldness of manner v  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7551-00000110"/> 218        INGEMSCO. more sorrowful to him than even her angry outhreak, and hopelessly he watched her dark figure passing along the deserted street. At the cottage gate, for the first time she faltered. ,The tension of nerve which had thus far borne her up now nearly gave way, and she trembled violently, struck with a great dread that made her fear to learn the worst. She faltered-but the next instant had flung open the gate, entering with the wind that toss- ed the dead leaves on the grass. Down from the balcony, through the parlor lattice, streamed a light. Raising herself to a low bough of the embowering grape-vine, shrinking back into the shadow, she could see within. Her mother had risen from the easy-chair upon the back of which she laid one hand while the other was in Harry's, who, flushed and excited, spoke. The mother's head was averted, but to the watcher with- out, the haughty, unmoved attitude was full assurance that Harry spoke to a deaf heart. Alice had thrown herself ttpon the sofa, her face buried in the cushions. At length the mother-spoke. Margaret's straining ear failed to distinguish one syllable uttered in those quiet even tones, but she saw Harry's dismay, saw Alice, spring up, and, weeping bitterly, catching her mother's hands, implore. In vain. For, putting her gently aside, she replied, moving to take up a lamp from the table near Margaret's window. "Alice, Harry, I command you say no more. I will not hear another word. Not lightly have I taken my resolution, and nothing shall shake it. I will never see her more. And I forbid you, Alice. After to- morrow it is not possible that you should meet. Hush,   INGEMSCO.        219 my darling, she is unworthy your grief. Good-night, my children both." She left the room with a steady step. mlice sank again upon the sofa, striving with her now audible sobs, while Halry rushed out and down the stairs. All this Margaret saw and heard. Could she have seen the mother's coldness melt in floods of weeping- could she have heard her own name moaned in the mother's troubled sleep--she would not have trusted to the cruel words, but would have knelt for pardon until her prayer must have been answered. -As Harry passed,- Margaret cowered back like a guilty thing. But he saw the flutter of her dress in the moonlight. "Margaret," he said, in a low tone; "can that be you?" She came forward reluctantly, whispering: "Harry, O Harry! can you then forgive." Her trembling pleading touched him deeply. "Believe me, Margaret, I have never blamed you," he hastened to reply. "What you have done, I know was done without design, and therefore without guilt. But I loved you too well, Margaret, not to have re- leased you, had you come to me." "Oh! what shall I do? what shall I do?" she moaned, covering her eyes. He gently drew away her hands, "You must not despair," he attempted to comfort. "Remember, you have two always near her, who never forget you. Her own heart, too, pleads for you. She must, she will relent, when the suddenness is past." Margaret shook her head.      1  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7551-00000111"/> 220        INGEMSCOo "I have forgotten how to hope," she said. "But you, Harry, you will send for me, when--if she is ill at any time. Please God, I may be dead--but if I am not, then at least I may go to her. Promise me dfy- that, dear Harry!" "I will. You may trust to me.' "Tell my poor Alice--" she began. "Alice-you must see her. I will call her," he cried. "No, no, you must not. My mother forbids. Stay -one moment." She steadied her voice, and then went on: "Tell Alice to love me. Pray her not to doubt me. Tell her I have her prayer-book. And may God in heaven reward you. Farewell." "Surely you are not alone," he asked anxiously. "No, not alone," and she grew hard again. He walked beside her to the gate, and when he had opened it for'her, he silently held out his hand. As she put hers into it, all the strong composure which had so long supported her, gave way, and the pent-up agony found relief in tears. Unrestrainedly she wept, and, repressing his own emotions, he soothed her with gentle comforting of sympathy and hope. By word nor gesture did he once recall to her a Harry other than her childhood's friend. And as such she thought of him, when at the gate they parted with a friendly pressure of the hands. Ernst saw her tears falling quietly during her home- ward drive. And he hoped again; not for himself, but for her whose peace was dearer far than his own. She was forgiven, he thought.

AUGUST had passed'away, and a September sunset was commingling with the silvery blue of the Egeri, and green and gray shadows of surrounding shores. The husband and wife were 'together in the library. Margaret sat within a   cloister window, her brow  rest- ing on her clasped hands and a volume open in her lap, but no page turned. Ernst bent over a desk, writ- ing, raising his head occasionally, as time wore on, to gaze with self-reproachful compassion upon the droop- ing figure half concealed behind the curtains. As if the  stillness had become insupportable, he  rose and walked the floor restlessly. "She sleeps, poor child," he said, pausing at length before her. "Happy  indeed, were it for her if she slept forever."             * Long he stood thus, listening to the regular breath- ing, watching the slight movements of the slumberer.   INGEMSCO.        223 Once her lips parted in a sigh. He passed his hand across his eyes. "Something must be done," he thought,-" her grief grows heavier day by day. Something to arouse her from this crushing apathy. Oh! that I knew where to find her mother!" A long tress, fallen from the massive twist, lay coiled upon her book. He stooped and raised it to his lips. "Margaret, my Margaret, have I then lost thee for- ever?" That instant he heard a voice without, saying gayly: "In the library? This door? Nay, never mind, my good man--I'll announce myself." The door opened and the speaker came forward with quick, light step and extended hands. Ernst started. He raised himself erect and stared as one who sees a vision. He did not, move nor take his eyes from her smiling face while she crossed the room to lnim. He held the hand she laid in his in both his own, tight, as though to convince himself that it was there, detaining it, a prisoned thing. He looked down upon her, still with the same half doubt- ing, half wondering gaze.  "You are come," he said slowly, "at last, at last!"  "Then you really did expect me," cried the Bar- oness Waldien; "and after all Mademoiselle Alice wrote, though she said she would not, that I should surprise la belle mari6e. She said, too, that you would be glad to see me. De grace, bid me welcome, Mon- sieur! Say you are glad to see me."

At her first word, he had dropped her hand, draw. ing a deep breath as one rudely awakened in midst . of a dream. She awaited an answer, and he said with evident effort: "You are right, I have long looked for you. Far longer than you can know. Glad to see you? I " He quitted her side abruptly. Ostensibly, he did so to draw back the curtain which was hiding Margaret. The Baroness sprang forward. "Qu'elle est belle! qu'elle est tout-a-fait charmante!" she exclaimed. "Ah mon comte, how you must be happy!" His mouth contracted in pain. She asked: "Wake her, Monsieur. I am all impatience." "Go you and wake her," he replied. He stood aloof while she put her arms about his wife, and softly kissed those lips he had kissed but once, and might not hope to kiss again. He saw the shrinking, indignant start before the eyeswere fully open, given, he knew too well, with the thought of him. But when her eyes -met Aimne's, right joyful was their smile. "What! Aim6e--Baroness Waldfen!" "None other. And you really are glad to see her? Mademoiselle, your sister, said " "Alice? When did you see Alice?"Margaret cried breathlessly. "It has ten days, at Baden. She was pretty and fresh as ever, only a shade paler, she confessed in grieving for you. She could talk to me of nothing but you. And M. le Comte should hear," she added archly, "the description his belle-seur gave to my Ludwig. But, quarter to his modesty r"   INGEMSCO.        225 "Did you see Mrs. Ross?"Ernst asked, after wait- ing in vain for Margaret. "To exchange bows, that was all. They left Ba- den immediately. But with Mademoiselle Alice I had a conversation. She told me that her married sister-not you, Marguerite-was with them." "Where were they going?"Ernst asked again, per- ceiving that Margaret would put no question. "This good-for-nothing memory of mine! I did not make much of attention, for sans doute, they will write. Mademoiselle Alice cried a great deal in speak- ing of you, Marguerite. Your first separation, n'est oe pas?" Margaret bowed assent. She could not trust her- self to speak "I -told her," AimBe continued, "that Switzerland owes to be her home during one half of the year, and Scotland yours during the other. She said she would like it well,.^he was so fortunate in having one " noble, true-hearted, high-souled gentleman, her beau-frere." Involuntarily Margaret glanced at, Ernst. Their eyes met. She rose quickly and moved to the farther end of the apartment, ringing the bell for lights in the twilight. When she turned, it was without a shade of embarrassment. "A reason, Monsieur?

"And must you go to-morrow?"Ernst inquired. "C'est cela m6me. My husband will be at Schwyz. He will be disappointed indeed, if I bring not you, Monsieur, and his belle 6cossaise. Here, Marguerite, come and convince this stubborn husband of yours." "What is it?" asked Margaret. "Understand. It must be that to-morrow morning you post for Munich with us. Hear my plans--my plans, for my lord and master never lords it over me," she hinted gayly, glancing toward Ernst.  Eh bien, our route-if you approve-is through Glarus, St. Gallen, and the Tyrol, staying ourselves on the way at our castle of Waldien. Apres, a long, gay, happy visit to Munich. What says Madame la Comtesse?" She said '"Charming," faintly smiling. "Bon! But M. le Comte has made objections. He dreams, perhaps, to have his own way and keep you here all to himself. Convince him, ma belle, of the utter futility of one such idea for all his life.. Make him pass under the yoke, as I made my Ludwig. Comme ga!" Lightly laughing, she drew forward the reluctant Margaret. And when she stood face to face with her husband, Aimee laid her hand beneath her friend's chin, playfully lifting thus her face to him. She took her passive hand and placed it in his. It trembled in his grasp like a frightened bird, and her color varied and the lashes quivered on her cheek. He looked at her inquiringly. The proud resolve that her friend should suspect nothing, induced her still to keep her face upraised. Perhaps he misinterpreted the blushes there. Per- haps the touch of her soft mouth swept away the V   INGJMSCO.        227 weary weeks of estrangement. Perhaps he dreamed of reconciliation. For, still retaining her hand, he drew her to his breast, and his- embrace was close as though naught divided them. Aimee, before the mirror, had removed her bonnet and was engaged in smoothing with white and jew- eled hand the dark braids so meet a setting to the dark and rosy face. Therefore, husband and wife were, as it were, alone when he released her, and his eyes met hers, seeking assurance of forgiveness.  Instead, her lip curled and she flashed upon him scorn unutterable. "Cruel, ungenerous!" she said, in a tone audible to him alone. And she moved to Aimbe's side, laying her hand caressingly upon her shoulder. Ernst turned abruptly and quitted the apartment.

It was possible that she might not, of the blossoming vales, the wooded, snow-crown- ed ranges, the peasant-life, of Switzerland and the Ty- rol, where the scenery's romantic lights and shades soften the hard outlines of poverty and toil. He could not reconcile Margaret's sudden, eager consent to his urging of the Baroness's invitation, with the dull indifference of a moment before. But consent she did, at the first earnest word from him. And eagerly consent, though, when Aimee had gone to her room, she stole out upon the cloisters, and he, coming suddenly upon her there, found her sobbing as though her heart would break. He would have spoken, but she rushed past him, repelling him with an angry gesture. But she was bright as the sunrise upon Lake Egeri as the traveling-carriage rolled along beside its waters. The Baroness Waldien, confessedly very9leepy, loung- 'ed back upon the cushions, exerting herself only so far as to glance through half-shut eyes upon the dis-    INGEMSCO.        229 tant jagged form of Mount Einsiedlen, or on the green graves of Morgarten, that garden of death wherein sprang up the tree of life for Switzerland. Margaret talked and laughed with what seemed to      ^ Ernst forced gayety. Until Schwyz was neared, and the fragrance. of the churchyard pinks, blossoming again, wafted on the morning breeze. Ay, there gleamed the church out from the elms that threw their shortening shadows greenly upon the stone wall and pathways winding between wood- en crosses and quiet graves, one living mass of shad- ed pinks in grassy borders. At the inn, Baron Waldien met delighted recogni- tion from his former friend and ally, Margaret, and then the travelers were once more on their way. Over lofty hills, through lowly valleys, beneath barren cliffs and across green pastures, beside the still waters of lakelets sleeping in sequestered glens, and beside the glancing cataracts of brawling mount- ain rivulets. An occasional glacier flashed back, in rays of blue and green, the sunshine. Far up green Alps, where distance vailed all muddy hoof-trodden surroundings, arose the solitary Senner-hut's moss- covered, stone-staid roof. Noon was beginning to assert itself above the over- hanging heights, when through a wooded defile glanc- ed the little Glarus See. How quiet it was - The lake, like a great sapphire, gleamed darkly blue, now that the sun looked directly down upon it almost unshad- owed. Now the mighty Glarnisch rises in the rear, and the town of Glarus rests below, while stillness is un- broken save by the far-off lowing of cattle, the tinkle  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7551-00000116"/> 230         INGEMSCO. of their bells, or the drowsy repetitions of herdsman's jodel. -Near by lie Glarnisch's grim thunderbolts, that centuries ago the valley's giant guardian flung down the steep descent, eight thousand feet, to awake the sentinel echoes. A strange, weird town is Glarus. A walled city encompassed by rocky ramparts so mighty that even King Sol dares seldom venture in to contend with the shadows on the battlements, or cross the dark, cold, clear river, flowing all silently, a natural moat around. In the narrow, irregular- streets, the hum of spinning- wheel and loom dispels the enchanted city, and many a comely rosy maiden or matron, or artisan in tassel- ed cap, gazes out upon the stranger from the low, mas- sive entrances of those antiquated frescoed houses. It was nightfall when they stopped at Netstall, and the inn was full to overflowing of pilgrims from Our Lady of Einsiedlen. It was but just after her fete, the fourteenth of September, and "the tables of the money- changers, and the seats of them that sold doves," were returning to their respective habitations. For the fete was a merry-making and a money-making, as testi- fied the full pockets and empty booths of many a Glarus and farther away peddler. One peep into the beer-fumed, smoke-befogged traveler's room was all- sufficient for Baroness Waldien. "Tout beau, tout beau," she exclaimed, drawing her husband away from his inquiries for the host. "Mon ange, I am not going to stay here to-night." Baron Waldien, against whose stalwart, middle age his little Aim6e resembled those fragile alpenrosen which love to nestle beneath the shelter of a gray. mountain fir, listened with a good-humored smile,   INGBMSCO.         231 softening the rugged features and the clear gray eyes, not quick, but steady and far-seeing. "Alsdann, my dear," he said, "I suppose you are going to sleep in the woods." "Still farther from my intentions. Cudgel your brains for a brighter idea." "It is some distance farther to Mollis, Aimee, and I question whether we would meet with better accom- modations." Here Luise, who had been uneasily twisting the corner of her apron, and had opened her mouth more than once, as if to speak, plucked her mistress by the dress, and whispered something pleadingly. "1That is perfectly delightful, Luise," Margaret re- turned. "Aimee, it will suit you exactly, as you are so dissatisfied here. Luise wants to take us to her grandmother's. It is not far, and she promises a wel- come warm and eatable."     X Down in the narrow glen, among the mountains, falls a mountain river, brawling and foaming, and struggling through the rocks until it reaches a lake, a tiny, silver oval, at the base of ranges that rise up straight on either hand, and throw here a high indent- ed line, and there a truncated cone, upon the smooth mirror, and then open at the farther end a winding egress for the river. There is no carriage-way down the steep descent from the south, and, following Luise's directions, within a quarter of a mile of the cottage, the travelers alighted and pursued on foot the path the herds had trodden. The way was rugged, and when Aimbe presently- claimed her husband's arm, Margaret was left beside Ernst, and could no longer refuse his assistance., i   &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7551-00000117"/> 232        INmGMTSCO. They crossed a rustic bridge, where the stream fell down from a thundering cataract into the lake, and awaited. at the foot of a grassy- crag, while Luise ran up to the cottage above to give warning and to rel t ruminate, for its only light was of the moon, glitter- ing on the gilded tiles shaped and put together much like a fish's scales. Margaret was standing, her arm within her hus- band's, looking from the pathway where the water glimmered at- her feet, up through shimmery beeches and heavy-boughed pines, to the cottage on the crag above, and higher yet the steep wooded mountain- sides almost overhanging-so lonely, still, untroubled- ,and. the full moon glancing through the net-work over- head. Something of the peace of nature was stealing over her heart, when in midst of her reverie came Aim6e's lobw speech to the Baron: "I like this traveling very well, so long as one has a good inn after a long day's travel, and can thus keep out of ken of poverty. I have such shrinking from -the very sight of toil and hardship. There, you need not say a word," and she laid her hand playfully upon his lips. "I know just how wrong it is, and how silly, but, wrong or silly, it is the one lesson the past has taught me, and I take it for what it is worth. And I will-yes, I will--turn away from even the shadow of trouble, all my life long." Margaret did not hear his answer. She felt only the start Ernst gave when "the past" left Aimee's lips. She withdrew from his arm her hand, for she could not control its trembling, and, helpless in the tumultuous rush of indignation, held for support by a tree beneath which she stood. A something cold met   INGEMSCO.        233 her touch there, and, her self-possession already taxed beyond its powers, she sprang back with a cry. All gathered round, and the moonlighte showed, to her infinite mortification, the cause of her alarm--a. large, unevenly-shapen stone imbedded -in the trunk, ,where careful hands had kept the bark cut away. Margaret examined it with some curiosity. "'Twould seem to have a meaning," she said, "and yet this rough-hewn mass-no inscription-what can it be?" "Possibly," replied Zalkiewski, " a charm, like the English horse-shoe before the door of country cross- road inns, to keep away witches who may yet be seen sailing through the air on their broomsticks away above this grand old pine and those larches that al- most hide the cottage on the cliff. The peasants here are very superstitious. Even the familiar woodpecker and crow are evil omens." "Ah! 'here is Luise; she can tell us. This stone, Luise?" said Margaret. Luise looked, and raised her little dumpy figure upon tiptoe, and kissed it. "My grandmother, gracious lady," she returned, "can tell the story so much better than I. Will you come in? She is both ready and anxious." They climbed the steps worn in the cliff, and pass- ing by the ground-floor devoted to wood, wagon, etc., entered the cottage by the entrance-stairs running up on the outside to the small balcony. A cheerful, ruddy glow gleamed from the great brick stove upon the wooden-paneled ceiling and walls gay with pic- tures from Bible and Swiss history-upon the large wall-clock with swinging pendulum and Holy Dove i.  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7551-00000118"/> 284         NGEMSCO. beneath; 'the crucifix in that far corner, and amulets and gifts from pilgrimages depending there; the pegs above the bed, where were crossed a Russian sword and a French sabre, patriotic trophies of the French invasion; a massive gilded chest of drawers; the cen- tre-table, above which a tallow candle in its wooden chain dangles from the low ceiling. Beyond, are dimly seen the large, dark, lofty kitchen, reaching to the roof,' and the stairs leading to sleeping apartments over the family sitting-room. Down these stairs, as her guests entered, came the d stout, handsome, large-featured, heavily-built house- mother herself, and her kindly brown eyes and large- handed hospitality gave the warm welcome Luise had promised. As for the eatable one, she and Luise bustled about, she shaking the floor with substantial tread, while Luise tripped briskly, only stopping to hug some well-known wooden trencher in return for childhood's bread' and milk, or to exclaim over that dear old bowl-bustled about until that was unde- niably upon the table. "Schabzieger cheese! What, is it here that it is made?" asked Margaret, as she sprinkled the grayish grated powder on her butterbrod. The old woman had drawn her spinning-wheel be- fore her as she sat in her arm-chair by the stove, and was plying it busily, when she replied with polite won- derment: "Do you not know, gracious lady? Here grows that precious herb Ziegenklee, or, as some name it, Siebenzeit, for its flavor changes seven times a day. It is this which, ground and mixed in, gives the cheese its peculiar flavor and color. Though we can   INGEMSCO.        235 get things from foreign parts, I care for nothing from beyond these mountains. The cheese and wine I make myself, for though Glarus is no vineyard, I have a sunny slope on which mine thrives. That tea grows wild in a glen in yonder range beyond the lake. And even that venison," she added laughingly, " doubtless I could say I made it myself after a fashion, for I found it in my dairy this morning, in place of one of my best round cheeses." "In place of a cheese?" "Ay, gnadige Grafin. Some belated hunter, I wot, some armer Schacher, hungered as he journeyed, en- tered into my dairy, and bartered his good venison for my good cheese. You are surprised. Do they not' thus everywhere? Our dairies are unbolted, and when one is in need, he eats and leaves his money in the dish." "And what if he eat and leave no money?" "But they do not so," she said, and lifted her eyes in mild surprise on Margaret. "I have heard the proverb, '(Uri is the conscience of Switzerland,' but begin to believe it is Glarus. Good mother, I would fain live where, when we have a right to bread, we are not given stones--cold, hard, relentless, crushing to the earth," she made answer bitterly. Then quickly taking up her last word as a digression to thought, she continued: "By the by, Luise promised you would give an account of one of these-a stone let in, as it were, into the great pine beneath the cliff."  Luise might have told, lady, but she and Sanchen like well my stories of the olden time ; and she paused in her spinning to stroke lovingly the fair head laid upon her knee.  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7551-00000119"/> 236         INGXMSCO. "Sanchen, I had forgot. Where is she?" " Have I not told the Countess?" said Luise. .( She was a Braut three months ago, and here in Glarus the betrothed must marry in three months.

Else, liebe Grafin, I might not go with you. But, grandmother, the story-"And she dropped her head again.   a "It is not much of a story, gracious ladies," the old woman began, seeing the Baroness had pushed her stool back from the table, and seated herself on the 'long bench beside the stove, her elbow on her knee, her chin in her palm, in listening attitude. Ernst and his segar had betaken themselves to the lake-shore, where they might be seen wandering back and forth, and the Baron lounged at the open door with his meerschaum.                   . "It is not much of a story, gracious ladies; but my little maiden here is so proud of it that she loves the great old stone as if it had sense and feeling, for it was--" "Ach! dear grandmother," interrupted Luise,( "tell it as you were used to tell to Sanchen and me in the long winter nights." She smiled and passed her large strong hand across the girl's hair as it rested yet upon her knee, and made a new beginning. "How they strive!" she said, fixing her gaze upon the fire-glow, as though she saw a living struggle in the fierce onward sweep of the flames, the pallid wav- ering of the falling ashes, " how they strive and push   iNGsMTSCO.         237 and struggle, there at the north gates where treach- ery has gained them access unawares, the Austrian hordes against that handful of free-hearted Swiss.

To the fore the wrongs of centuries, the chains of the oppressor,-rise-Lbulwarks, over which the free do battle, and the pitchfork and the Alpen- stock beat down many a shining sword. Day marches by--its April clouds that follow in mourning weeds may weep above the brawling Linth, but they can not wash away the blood that mingles with its current. Shadows are closing in' across the gorge-the bearded vulture darkles with them in the pines. And still five mortal hours Swiss hundreds hold at bay the Austrian tens of thousands, till Nature enters in alliance with her champions, and down into the rug- ged heights surrounding, down into the foeman's serried ranks, roll and crash, in thunders louder than artillery, great stones and loosened rocks, toppling down the Austrian pride, scattering broadcast death, disorder, flight. How they strive, and push, and struggle, away from the north gates, where faithful- ness has gained the victory! How they throw down their arms, or use them but to cut a pathway through their panic-stricken columns-trample upon friend and brother-stumble in their headlong haste, and 'fall-- and die.  Fetters on these mountains! thus they spfrn them.  And the brave Landamman and his men, gathered from the cornfields and the pastures, armed with scythes and reaping-hooks, the stout ax of the forester, the cross-bow of the hunter, sweep downward like an avalanche from the heights where  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7551-00000120"/> 288         INGEMSCO. they rose to Freedom's rescue, and, shoulder to shoul. der with their brethren in the valley, rush on, and over- whelm the foe. When the moon looked down that night, she counted the Swiss dead by scores, the Aus- trian by thousands. And the rocks, grim gravestones in the gorge, had need of inscription none save that the foeman's gore had writ. Nafels is graven there in bloody characters." "And my far-away grandfather," Luise hastened to put in, " was of the brave Landamman's band. That tablet in the great pine, dear Countess, he hurled down. And there is a deep red stain, a dark streak across-you may see it by to-morrow's sun.  And he placed it there with his own hands after the battle. He is passed away, and generations after him.  His cottage on this cliff has crumbled long ago, but this grand old pine remains his monument, and his child- ren, tilling the same fields, building on the self-same crag, have guarded it from injury." "This species--Siberian pine or alvier, is it not?- is very long-lived, I believe," said Margaret. "It had need be, lady," replied the hostess. "For it grows but a span in five or six years.  It is a price- less tree to our mountains, durable for building; these walls and ceiling are paneled with it." "Oh! then, that is the faint delicious fragrance I have been observing ever since I came in," Margaret interrupted. "Which hardly diminishes with centuries. Then too, its branches furnish winter fodder, and the seeds, which soon we   will begin to gather, are the great delicacy of our winter festivals. We are a contented people, though strangers call our mountains barren.   INGEMSCO.         239 And if one is industrious and has luck; if he have money in his pocket when first the cuckoo greets the spring; what with our tea and slate, our crops of flax and rye and barley, the hay of which one gathers a hundred pounds a day beyond the chamois' reach; the winter spinning and the weaving, and dyeing, one can live and add a bit of land for children who come after. I was not born in Glarus, and I still wear the costume of my native beloved Zug," she added, glancing down upon her green petticoat and red stockings; " yet methinks nowhere are the dance and the merrymaking, the Ranz des vaches, and the song of the reapers in the harvest, one half so blithe as here in cheerful Glarus. That may be because it saw my blithest days," and she sighed softly; "for my seliger Mann was Glarus born, and lived, and died, and sleeps with his fathers here." As Margaret listened, to her memory recurred Lu- ise's long-forgotten story of that cave in Zug. She pushed back her sleeve. Yes, there was the ominous cross, a dark line just threading the round, white, taper arm. She looked, scoffing at its broken charm, scoffing until a thought flashed upon her and dashed the color from cheek and lip--that at the marriage altar she had yielded up that hand, and, of course, the cross it bore, into the keeping of another. She sat staring down upon it with stony gaze-a gaze taking in not it alone, but all the full past, all the empty future. A call from Baron Waldien roused her, and throw- ing over her head a shawl, caught up in passing, from the bench where sat his wife still in the same attitude, but fallen perfectly asleep amid Nafel's thunders, she  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7551-00000121"/> 240        INGcMTSCO. went out to him, -perching hers6lf upon the balcony railing, while he, puffing away at his meerschaum, leaned with his back against the cottage wall, and was soon deep with her in metaphysics, or aloft among the starry host. Presently Ernst came up the stairs, and without word or look to Margaret, entered. .No longer was she an attentive listener. For the sound of a meas- ured tread up and down, pauselessly up and down the room, jarred through the Baron's speech. Nay, not pauselessly. Once it staid, and Margaret, slightly changing her position, glanced through the tiny, oval- paned window. No one within save Ernst and Ai- mee. He stood before her, looking down upon her as Margaret had ere now beheld him, a troubled, proud, indignant look, yet withal of yearning tender- ness.

Onward still our party, following the river's course, until, through] a break in the mountain chain, the sunset skies and the Wallen See appear. There it lies, twelve miles in length, and three in breadth, everywhere-north, south, east, west--cliffs rising perpendicularly to the very heavens. Gaunt, stern walls of rock, crested with darkly-tossing pines, giv- ing at intervals in their precipitous descent but pre- carious support to tree and shrub, and festooning vine glowing with scarlet berries. And here and there are waterfalls leaping joyously down to rejoin the waters that have wandered from them below, or trickling slowly and tearfully, regretting their forsaken springs. The sun was setting when the boat pushed off from shore, manned by two picturesque peasants who, sad and wild from time to time, with scarcely moving lips greeted the silence with the familiar Kuhreihe..' "Silence was pleased," doubtless, for yet more tran- quil was her reign when Murg and her opposite neigh- bor Quinten fell behind. The sunset pomp paled in the heavens. It found little sympathy in the dark depths reflecting darker heights. But the stars, pale- shrouded in white drifts, and the full moon, silvery at first, but gradually shining golden, as wore on the four or five miles to Wallenstadt, the night's haven of rest, by and by glorified the waters. j I          C  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7551-00000122"/> 242         INGrIrSCO Bright to look back upon, despite the gloom over- shadowing her life, was the ensuing week to Mar- garet.

And while the past was banished, she could enjoy every thing. At the way-side inn, at the close of a fatigu- ing day, none acquiesced more cheerfully in the dis- comfort, nor did more credit to the peasant fare, even horrifying Aimee by relishing the seeds of the Siber- ian pine. None so won the hearts of all by kindly interest in the chubby little ones, in the in-gathered harvest, or the favorite tradition. And often, when riding beside her firm friend the Baron, she watched from some grand height the peasants in their costumes of vivid coloring, flitting far below like butterflies across the fields-or gazed upward from the winding valley road to where the mountaineers, holding by one hand with grappling-irons to the face of the preci- pice, reaped in wild glens amid seemingly inaccessible cliffs the rich crop of* hay-or chatted with some light-hearted Sennerin, standing sunburnt, stout, and rosy, among her cattle, resting perchance a plump arm upon the neck of a belled and ribboned favorite, then, if Ernst were not near, Margaret's laughter would ring out with almost its formerilightness. Ernst saw this, and but seldom darkened her enjoy- ment with his presence. The Baron also saw it, and his kindly scrutiny some-. times troubled Margaret.   X X.

She was watching a red sparkle of light, glimmering glow-worm like, amid the trees, and a dark form, restless as herself, wandering to and fro. After a time both disappeared, and then she yielded to her longing for air and motion, and, unfastening the window, which opened to the floor, she stepped out upon the portico. She passed noiselessly on and down the marble stairs, to the lawn. From terrace to terrace she descended rapidly, striv. ing in the wild paths to lose and leave behind the wilder thoughts that would not suffer her to rest. Yet, constant still, they followed. She gained the beach at length, and there paced up and down with unquiet and uneven steps. Now with drooping figure she walked on, and in the moonlight great tears fell. Then the bowed head was raised defiantly, and she dashed the tears away, as anger conquered sorrow. A barren mass of rock overhung the lake. Driven by yearning unformed to thought, she ascended this, and stood there, looking down into the deep, dark waters moaning and writhing at her feet.

Through drifting clouds the moon streamed down upon the girl, a very statue of despair. Her hands were-loosely clasped together, and the wind flung the heavy tresses, unbound, over her white robes. She started as a touch was laid upon her arm, and turning saw Ernst. She shook off his hand impatient- ly, but shook off with it the spell which the waves had flung around her. "Forgive me," Ernst said, "but you did not hear my call, and the storm increases so rapidly that there is danger in remaining here." The pent-up feelings would have vent at last. "Why did you then disturb me?" she cried vehe- mently. "Why did you not leave me to that dan- ger? Do you imagine life is any thing to me? Do you dream that I have wish or hope, excepting death?

Ernst looked hastily around for shelter. It was near at hand, a pavilion gleaming white against the black shrubbery. But Margaret lifted her tearful eyes. "Ah! let us go on to the Castle," she implored. -"I can not," he answered firmly. "If you will not care for yourself, I must. The violence of the storm will soon pass away. Do not fear lest I intrude'upon you." She withdrew her arm without reply, and entered. Ernst stood at the entrance watching the clouds, until a suppressed sob smote upon his ear. The vivid light- ning flashed on Margaret, who had thrown herself upon the floor, her face hidden on her knees. He could not resist the impulse that led him to her side. And the long suppressed, enduring love and compassion in his heart, moved him to lay his hand softly upon hers, as he had done the day he saved her life--so long ago. A sharp shiver ran through her frame, and she drew away. He saw even in the uncertain light that she grew whiter than before. She gasped for breath once or twice, but when she spoke it was with quiet dignity. "You forget. I blame you not, for I myself was wandering to the past again, This can not be. There is that between us which may not be forgotten though forgiven. Let us not awake the restless ghost of the past. The present holds enough of misery for both. Two hands bound together, and a heart another holds," she went on bitterly. "'But no more. My hand may   INGEMCISCO.       24 7 never touch yours without a shuddering recollection of the hour when they were clasped in marriage, in  violation of all truth and honor." "Margaret, Margaret--when you withdrew your hand from mine the first glad day we met, it was not thus." "Not thus-not thus- O Heaven!" she moaned, "I loved him even then." And in uncontrollable weeping she covered her face. He perceived that in her anguish she forgot his presence. He doubted not an instant that the love for which she wep% had now but a grave within her heart. When the storm had calmed, and they stood in the portico together, she said tremulously: "Let us be at peace with one another." He bent over the hand yet resting on his arm- then turned away.  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7551-00000125"/> XX. "THE coming day When toil remitting lent its turn to play, And all the village-train, from labor free, Led up their sports beneath the spreading tree, And many a gambol frolicked o'er the ground, And sleights of art and feats of sirength went round." "ETES vous des n6tres to-day, Marguerite?" asked Aimee, tapping her on the shotilder.   I am enchant- ed that we arrived at Munich last evening, for to-day is, you know, our great Volks Fest, and as this is your first sojourn here, you will amuse yourself to go to the fete with all the world of Munich." Margaret turned from the ivy-bowered window from which she had been watching, interested, the crowded street. - "I was just thinking,' she said, "that if all the multitudes filling this beautiful Ludwig street were church-going, it- spoke well for the devoutness of Mu-  nich. But what is this festival, Aimee, and why did you not tell me before?" "Plait-il? Pauvre petite, did you nbt know?  It is an established fete held annually on the first Sunday in October, the omission of which would create as dire a thirst in the hearts of the gayety-loving Man- chener, as the suspension of the breweries could in   INGEMSCO.        249 their beer-loving throats. There are races in the pre- sence of royalty itself, and peasants from the mount- ains and the plains, in their holiday costumes, will, perhaps, prove a greater attraction to your uninitiated eyes, than-all the assembled Nite." "Oh! let us go. When and where is it to take place?"' "When! at noon, so that we will have but time to dress and set out so soon as our lazy lords shall be pleased to make their appearance to breakfast. Where! in the Theresien Meadow, without the city. Ludwig-ah! le voila qui vient. Mon ami, have you forgotten the October festival, or do you mean that we should miss it while you indulge in dreams?" "Gar nicht," good-humoredly replied the Baron, advancing; "but I believe you ladies dispense alto- gether with sleep. Traveling until ten last night, and bright as possible before ten this morning. Though the Countess, it-must be confessed, is somewhat, pale. What have you done with your bloom this morning?" "Precisely what I've done wish my good-humor, Louis," interrupted Aimee, "pocketed it until after breakfast. Romancists are in error when they depict heroines wandering in search of adventures, amiable and lovely at the unconscionable hour of dawn, as if amiability had been refreshed by a cup of good coffee, and a smoking petit-pain. Hans, let us have break- fast immediately," she added, as the servant appeared in answer to the bell. "Marguerite, I think we'll ven- ture to treat the Count without ceremony." "'And so you have never seen a Volks Fest," the Baronfsaid to Margaret, when she had seated herself  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7551-00000126"/> 250         INGEMSCO. at table. "Have you then no -annual festivals in Scot- land? And what becotes of your peasantry?" "Our lower classes are not so gay- as yours, but they are contented and happy. Our Highlanders would not exchange their own rugged work-a-day mountains for all your festive holidays." He looked admiringly at her flushed face and spark- ling eyes. "It is sun-clear," he said, " that you have mistaken your vocation. Are you not a destined mountain- nymph? Or are you one in disguise, or an Undine astray from your streamlets?" She had raised her head, with a merry reply upon her parted lips. But suddenly the light vanished from her eyes, and she sat silent, drooping them. The door opened and Ernst entered. "We have taken the liberty of sitting down to breakfast without you, for it is our October festival, and we are going to the Theresien Meadow," Aimee said apologetically, after the exchange of good-mor- rows, as her guest took his place beside his wife. "The October festival! I had quite forgotten. It is so many years- since I last saw it celebrated." "Then you have visited Munich before," the Baron said. "A five-year long visit." "You have acquaintances, friends, here?" Ernst smiled, one of his own rare smiles, a stranger to his eyes for many a weary day. "Friends, one or two," he replied. "But you would vainly seek them in the noble array of Vons, Barons, Counts, or Princes. In old Munich, close by the time- decayed Sendling gate, is a neat little bakery presided   INGMSCO.         251 over by a neat, little, rosy, smiling old woman. That is friend number one. Others, two or three nameless artists, I can no longer trace." The Baron appeared surprised-Aimee really hor- rified, though politely desirous of concealing the fact. "An exiled Pole," Ernst added, looking at her fix- edly, "has friends nor rich nor many. However, the few who do not shrink away, are true. And many a careless, gladsome hour, unpurchasable by the wealth of Ind, was mine in my free artist-life. Money is the, least good." "Oh! oh!" cried Aimee. "And what do you call the greatest?' "Hope," he said quietly. "Et vous, Marguerite?" "Fortune is lavish in her gifts, and comparisons are invidious," she replied! with latent irony. "No evasions, Madame. Bring her to confession, M. le Comte. It may be she thinks you the great gift. Truly, no small one." Aimee laughed. "It is Honor," Margaret answered, seeing that an answer was expected. "What, before love?" cried Aim6e. "' I could not love thee, dear, so much, Loved I not Honor more!'" she replied in a tone sinking almost to a whisper. Ernst cast one hurried gla4nce on her averted face, and colored violently. "Love without Honor," began the Baron, pushing away his plate, and folding his arms deliberately upon the table. "Ach! gracious Baron," Aimee exclaimed, and rose  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7551-00000127"/> 252     .    TXCTSCO. in playful haste. "Do not, I pray you, whelm us in the bottomless swamp of those dreadful metaphysics. I will both love and honor you if only you will order the carriage. Allons, mes amis, have you forgot the fete?" In a handsome barouche they were driving at noon toward the Theresien Meadow. The sun shining clear and bright from a cloudless deeply blue- October sky, glows upon buildings rich in rainbow splendor or softened into neutral shades, contrasted by occasional gleams of white. Many of the house-fronts are frescoed in medallions, groups or landscapes in clear relief against a background of deep blue crimson, or fainter tint. Within as without almost every window clambers ivy, sometimes sus- pended in swinging baskets of every style and hue, according to the inmates' taste, or want of it. On passes the carriage, through various throngs of vehicles and hurrying equestrians and pedestrians. Margaret gazes around with eager interest; here, upon a group of students in brilliant tri-color caps and badges; there, upon a cluster of mountaineers, a family in-coming, apparently--the father and mo- ther, arm in arim, any number of curious, joyous children, staring about open-eyed and open-mouthed, and in the centre the cheery grandmother in deep- blue petticoat and gray cloak, her silver hair folded smoothly back beneath the silver, swallow-tailed Mu- nich cap. She is leaning proudly upon the arm of a young girl who stands in bashful confusion, her cheek glowing and her left hand nervously twisting the silver chains crossed and recrossed upon her black bodice, while her right is clasped within that of a   INGEMSCO.         253 young man wearing the green peaked hat of the mountaineer, decorated with chamois beard and tuft of black-cock feathers. Margaret formed a rustic ro- mance of this, reverting to her simple idyl, until a crowd of peasants from the plains shut out the view. These, with their long, short-waisted coats, low broad- brimmed hats, and umbrellas many-hued, were yet quaintly picturesque in contrast to the mountaineers and the gayly-costumed Munich populace. The carriage drove through Ludwig Strasse, where it widens into the Odeon Square and terminates at Feldherren Hall. At Margaret's request, Schwanthal- er Street was traversed, past brilliantly-painted hous- es, past the white quiet studios of Von Schwanthaler, the -great sculptor, and designer of the colossal Ba- varia which has since been erected on the Theresien Meadow. And now the city is left behind and the Theresien Meadow lies before. Tents, flags, and royal canopy of white and blue, Bavarian colors; green wreaths and bowers of spruce fir environing the race-course and the seats and platforms reserved for the nobility; gay crowds and gayer processions of wagons laden with chefs-d'oeuvre of nature or of art; and the Art-King Ludwig graciously distributing prizes, while music fills the air. And the meadows are gleaming in au- tumnal flowering, the groves in foliage, gold and crim- son, the distant Alps blue as the clouds among which they stand. The ceremonies concluded, with a most enthusias-' tically vociferous "Lebe hoch!" for the king, the throng diminished, yet leaving thousands to the de- lights of beer and coffee-bowers.  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7551-00000128"/> 254        rsWGRTMrTCO. "It is so charming a day," said Aim6e, as her car. riage followed in the departing crowd, "that what say you, Marguerite, to spending it in rustic fashion, driving along some pleasant road, and dining, or rath- er lunching, at some one of the genre of our suburban villages?" A fitting close to this gala of new sights. It would--" A start and sudden pause ensued. Aim6e turned in the direction of Margaret's gaze. Pressing on close behind her carriage was another, in which sat two well-dressed young ladies, and facing them two gen- tlemen. "Stop!" cried Aimee to her coachman, adding to Margaret: "There are the Von Amsels, Kathe and her brother's wife, both intimate friends of mine.. You must know them." "Not now," Margaret whispered hurriedly. "I- But it was too late. The Von Amsels already re. cognized the Baroness, and in another instant had driven up.' The gentlemen alighted; one, arrested by Aim4e's exclamation of delighted surprise, stopping beside her with an air of lazy nonchalance, following his friend furtively while he came round to the side where sat Margaret, and Ernst opposite. "I came here a week ago with Falkenstein," said Mr. More-for it was indeed he-in answer to the Countess's questioning. "I can not do. justice in words to my delight at your arrival. It is so fortu- nate we did not leave town yesterday, as he wished. I find it very agreeable, but he is -so confoundedly restless and unreasonable-if he were only ordinarily   INGEMSCO.        255 civil to mortal women-should think the immortal god *had something to do with it-can hardly hold him down to one place for two days at a time, except at Vienna while lMiss Alice was there. However, since Munich has received such an accession of attractions, Falkenstein shall no longer drive two-in-hand, save up and down Ludwig street. Now if only my ally, Miss Alice,* were here, we might da capo Low- erz." Margaret flung back her vail with a careless fold shielding her face. Not before Ernst had caught the gleam of tears rushing to her eyes. "And how is Miss Alice?"Mr. More next inquired. "Of course she wrote you of our meeting last month at Vienna, where they went to meet your sister, Mrs. Campbell. Mrs. Ross Was much better before I left. I urged May for authority, to go for you during her illness, but he said Mrs. Ross would not permit. I presume through fear of unnecessarily alarming you, and really it was unnecessary. May said he would himself go for you if she became worse." "Was Mrs. Ross then really very ill?"Ernst asked, observing Margaret's varying color, and her total in- ability to speak. Count Falkenstein came up at that moment, and, hearing the question, answered it to Margaret, as she gave him her hand: "Not seriously but still there was cause for anx- iety. I confess I thought them mistaken in withhold- ing the tidings from you; but Mrs. Ross was so de- cidedly convalescent before I came -away, that there is no longer cause for apprehension.  Mademoiselle Alice told me they would in -all probability winter in  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7551-00000129"/> 256        INGBISCO. Italy, going first to Naples. Have you heard fi'om there, Countess?' No reply, but a faint struggle for words, a low cry, and she must have fallen had he not caught her in his arms. "-Ay, claim her, she is yours now!" he muttered fiercely between his teeth, as Ernst started up, pale with fury.             X And withdrawn apart, he watched while her head fell forward on her husband's breast. Thick-coming thoughts pressed upon him as he watched, his hat low upon his brows shading his face, his right hand clenched upon his shoulder, where he still felt the light pressure of her head that for one moment had lain there. In his memory, to the ex- clusion of all present sounds, rang the few words of faint encouragement she had given him that evening, when, in the sunset, they floated on together to Schaa- nau. Every soft smile or gentle glance to him, shone gentler, softer, through the haze of memory, until he could almost believe this the fulfillment of the Lady Magdalona's story, the end of which he had said he knew not. The end? He would not think of that. She had clasped the golden fetters, he said, and brok- 'en the white rose-buds from the Garden of Love, and, perchance- perchance-- she was now straining her eyes in the darkness, looking back for their fair gleam- ing. A flush of triumph surged to his brow at the thought. Not one ray of pity for her. In truth, he would at that moment have seen her lie gasping her last breath there at his feet, rather than rise up the living, loving wife of another. He remembered not bruised flowers never bloom again. He remembered   INGEMSCO.        257 not their trampled whiteness could be white no longer. He did not waste one glance upon the future. He only saw that lovely face grow pale, that blight head droop, at his approach. So madly exultant was he, that only the anxious throng between deterred him from striding forward, dashing down in contempt any such barrier as a husband, and claiming her his own. So he stood there, his hand clenched tighter on his bieast, his breathing hot and hurried. Who shall say that in the midst of his alarm, Ernst felt no thrill of joy, thus. clasping his darling, her head pillowed on his shoulder, her pale cheek pressing his supporting arm? It was not long ere she regained consciousness, and for a moment yet lay motionless, breathing low and irregularly. Ernst knew that she was struggling to keep back the tears welling up beneath those closed lids. He knew not the something else that kept her there so still-the unconscious comfort of his sympathy. She roused herself at length, and gracefully thanked the thronging strangers for their proffers of assistance. It was but a foolish alarm, she said to her friends. Mr. More had spoken of a past illness of her mother, of which she was ignorant-and this was her first separation. Falkenstein heard her explanation, but he heard too her faltering tones, and he saw that she colored and shrank from his intent gaze. "You are not going back to town?" half queried Mr. More of Aimee. "We did intend to ruralize to-day," responded Ai- mee; , "but, Marguerite, we must postpone our drive. You are yet tant soit peu pale."  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7551-00000130"/> 258        INGFMSCO. "No, no, indeed. I am perfectly well, and. wish so much to go," Margaret hastily replied. "I entreat you, do not," her husband said. With averted eyes, and in a tone too low for any else to hear, she made answer : "Let me go. I must have excitement. I should go mad if I dared stop to think." There was no reproach in the voice, there was at  that moment no reproach in the heart which thus gave utterance, and yet it struck as such on that on which it fell. He had bent forward to speak to her, and he did not drop his eyes from her lowered lashes, but winced as though she had roughly bared an unhealed wound. He said: "It will do her no harm, Aimee." "And we will see you this evening, Mr. More?"' "Unfortunately engaged to Madame'Von Amsel," was his aside. "Ingrat! To-morrow, then. Mme. Von Amsel, and you,- Kathe, you are held engaged to dine with us to- morrow. Now, Max, the party is for you, expres, so don't go off on any of the absurd wanderings you have been so given to lately.' Falkenstein started and hesitated, looking at Mar- garet. "Do not fail to come," she said anxiously, thinking of the many questions she might ask of those loved lost ones--questions which faltered upon her lips as she caught Ernst's glance. "Auf wiedersehen, then," he returned abruptly lifting his hat and going back to his post of duty in the Vori Amsel's carriage.   INGEMSCO.        259 Away the others sped, until, half hid amid orchards where boughs drooped low beneath the rich legacy of summer, lay a village. Upon the outskirts stood its church, surmounted by pale green spire and steep roof of many-colored tiles, yet solemn and majestic enow in gray ivy-clad walls and Gothic windows. They found the doors open according to custom, but no'one was within save an old woman, but just re- turned from the fete, kneeling before the shrine of a favorite saint, her shriveled, toil-worn hands crossed upon the orange kerchief folded over her Shoulders. Here was none of that tawdriness too frequent in these village churches. A stone-colored wash replaced the -common white, and the sunshine fell dimly through simply painted windows upon gilded gallery and al- tar, which else might have been too gaudy. Aimee, crossing herself, sank upon her knees beside the peasant, and Margaret knelt apart, striving to raise her thoughts, bound in earth's deep shadow of grief, up to the glorious White Throne. She could find no words wherewith to pray, but all her soul arose in voiceless agony. Suddenly, from above, thrilled a low burst of music, filling the silent aisles with melody. Margaret turn- ed not, nor raised her head bowed upon her clasped hands, while solemnly poured forth the De Profundis. She knew those the rich tones of the organ, and a clear, sweet voice accompanying. Yet it was to her no earthly music, rather an answer from on high to her despair. And when triumphantly arose the words, "But there is mercy with Thee," they echoed in her heart as though an angel's voice had reassured her. The music ceased, and all eyes turned toward the  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7551-00000131"/> 260         INGEMSCO. gallery, seeking the singer. A light footfall was heard slowly descending the stairs, and presently ap- peared only a delicate, fair-haired boy. Could this pos- sibly be the musician?"Yes," he answered modestly, twisting his slender fingers together in embarrassment, and never once raising his eyes from the ground. "And hast thou not been to the great Fest-not seen the races?5"Margaret asked pityingly, when the child explained that he had left the little sister at play in the church-yard, and had gone up into the gallery to sing, as oftentimes he did. A smile somewhat sad passed over his face. "The lady does not then see that I am blind?" he said, lifting for the first time the sightless talls, a soft bright blue, revealing only by a vacuum of expression the darkness within. He told his simple story. He was one of the chor- isters, and the good Kapellmeister had taught him all he knew of music. And with a proud smile, he said he had already three piles of kreuzers, all his own earnings by singing in the church, and which he was noarding to surprise his mother with some day. For she, though mistress ofthe village inn, had not always a great deal of money. Margaret looked at AimBe. She smiled and nodded in response, and very soon a fourth pile of coins far eclipsing in value the other three together, was -put into the hands of the delighted child. Leaving the church-yard where the little sister play- ed hide and seek with a merry tribe of village children, behind the wreathed wooden crosses, among the tall rnamown grass, the boy led 'the way to the inn, where the garden was gay with sunflowers and dahas, and   rNGiMSCO.        261 peasant groups beneath the trees, and the inn's pink walls glowed rosily through a perfect grove of rosy apple-trees. Years after, when the child-musician had wandered on in life's journey out of sight of all save one of that party, a blind musician, led along in the hard, upward climb of genius, stood upon the heights at last, and grateful- ly acknowledged the helping hand once extended and never withdrawn, by that stern and silent man who withdrew that day somewhat aloof from the sympa- thizing strangers. As evening fell, the Waldien carriage pursued' its way toward Munich. On, over a rustic bridge thrown from steep bank to bank of the greenly-flowing Iser, with white shoals and promontories and rafts on which boatmen in gay costumes floated down from the distant mountains. On, through a long avenue of poplars, their lengthening shadows thrown behind by the declining sun, and past embowered villas, until the walls of Munich drew near and nearer, and the road merged into Ludwig Strasse. They enter this street by the open space where the Triumphal Arch has since arisen. The sun, sinking beneath the extensive plain where stands the city, throws a wondrous atmosphere of romance over the rich Byzantine architecture, deepening the coloring and softening the contrasting shades. Here, where the broad street is broader yet, is the pure, white, calm-looking University, with its long rows of win- dows arched, and medallions inclosing the head of poet, philosopher, or legislator. Opposite, cool and gray as the deepening twilight, is the Jesuits' College; while farther on, the slender white towers and glit-  &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7551-00000132"/> 262        INotwsco. tering crosses of the Ludwig Kirche are blending in- distinctly in the dusk with the few snowy clouds above. Silence is undisturbed save by the low plash of the fountain before the University; and as the stars come forth slowly one by one, the carriage draws up before the ivy-wreathed gray portico of the Waldiens.   XXiL u TEZ short and simple annals of the poor." "W IT here for me." This order given, the lady alighted from her droschke, at a street-corner in the neighborhood of the Sendling Gate. She walked slowly and thoughtfully along, now and then raising her eyes from the pavement to observe the houses as she passed. One at length riv- eted her attention. This was a modest bakery, stand- ing close by the ruinous old gate, in all the glories of salmon brick, pwhite stucco, and shining shop-window. Something else was there, however, to draw that at- tentive gaze. An old woman wearing the silver Mu- nich cap, scarlet petticoat, and white kerchief folded on her bosom, filled with her ample proportions the open doorway, looking up the street, shading her face with her withered hand. The lady advanced. "Have you fresh Brezeln?" she asked, her manner strangely embarrassed for so commnonplace a question. The woman glanced at her, surprised; then with a courtesy led the way into the shop. While she was making up the required parcel, her customer surveyed eagerly the surroundings. The shelves with their fragrant heaps of loaves, the well- filled glass case upon the counter, and the street-win-  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7551-00000133"/> 264        INiCMSCO. dow stocked with endless variety of cakes, all testified to neatness and abundance. "Will the gnadiges Fraulein direct me where to send? My granddaughter will be back presently; she stepped out just a moment ago," the old woman said, while she bent over the money-drawer, seeking change for the gold piece given her. "I will wait for her return," was the hurried reply, "and she can go with me." s"Let me then give you a seat by the fire. It is rather chilly here this damp morning." And the host- ess bustled about and placed a chair near the porce- lain stove behind the screen dividing the shop. "Yours is the prettiest bakery and the neatest I have yet seen in Munich," the stranger said, after a moment, while her eyes restlessly followed its owner, busied in arranging a tray of freshy-baked cakes. She glanced complacently around. "It is a nice place," she replied. "And all the brighter because a few years ago I never thought such would belong to me." "And how .did it come at length?" inquired the other. "A few years ago, gracious Fraulein, in place of this shop was a dingy house, old and dismal and crum- bling as the Sendlinger Thor itself, where, by dint of keeping two or three lodgers and baking a few loaves when I could get the meal, I managed to eke out a meagre living." "And whence then this-great change?" her inter- locutress asked again, almost impatiently. "By one of these very lodgers, my young lady. He came with scarce a kreuzer in his pocket, and a sick   INGEMSCO.        265 and wounded servant on his hands. He went first to my neighbor Dame Hanne, who, bless you, called the Herr a Jaherr for the coming, and would have naught more to say to him. She -told me, indeed, when the poor servant was lying almost at the point of death be- neath my roof, that I ought to send them both about their business, for they evidently had no friends in Munich, and heaven only knew where the first rent- money was to come from. And she did not like those ugly wounds; mightn't they be wicked men, burglars or the like? For was there not only last week a great robbery on the Dult Platz? But I could not turn a dying man out of doors, and besides, the young gentleman his master was so handsome and pleasant- spoken that he quite won my old heart. And to see him for all those years working for himself and his servant, too, who had lost the use of his right arm, and could not, therefore, earn half a living, that was truly beautiful! And he was so-kind to my poor son."- "How was that?" There were tears in the voice that questioned, as well as in that which replied: "My son was not bad, mein Fraulein, but he was my youngest, my Schoosskind, and-well, perhaps, as the neighbors said, I did indulge .him beyond what was right. Yes, it was certainly my fault. But he was not bad, only easily led astray, and so it was I left my elder son in the dear old home where he and I were born, afar in the mountains, afd followed my Karl to Munich when he took a fancy to come, think- ing he could gain more at his trade of wood-carving than in our village.

All the time, himself was working night and day, always giving away the half of what he made. My son lies yonder in God's Acre, and that he lived happily and died peacefully, I am grateful to the Herr Ba  " "What-what name did you say?" the lady inter- rupted falteringly.  "The Herr    But I forgot. Strange, that I never can remember. A count he is now. He fell heir to a great fortune, and I promise, you he forgot no one. This house he built for me then in the room of the old one, and furnished and stocked the shop." "And have you seen him since he went away?" "Did I say he went away? He did, though; but he is in Munich now, and came to see me directly he arrived. He -wants me to go back to my native vil- lage, and leave the shop to Gretchen, who is a Braut, and will be married very soon." "To the mountaineer?" The woman looked at the stranger, all amaze. "How did you know?" she exclaimed. "Were you not together last week at the festival? I recognize your face, I think." "Ach, then, mein Fraulein, you have seen us all. Anton is from the same village, and a good carver, like my poor Karl. But he gets much better paid, and so he is come to Munich, and Gretchen will be Back- erin and keep the shop as soon as she is married. And I am to go back to the old cottage. Not as I came, however; for the Herr Count will not hear of my going without a great deal of money, that my old   INGERISCO.        267 age may not be burdensome to even my kind, good son. The Herr Count calls this paying his debts; but I am sure any little kindness I was able to show him 4 he repaid tenfold while he wag yet poor." Some one came into the shop just then, and the talk- ative bakeress took her place behind the counter. The customer went out, and the door almost im- mediately opened again. This time it was a man's step, and a man's voice gave cordial greeting to "Mt- terchen Liese." The lady could see nothing, ensconced behind the screen. But at sound of that voice she started, and leaned forward in a listening attitude. "'Why, dame," it was saying cheerily, "you look younger and younger every day. You are growing a great deal younger than I."  + "That is because you won't marry, Herr Count," she replied decidedly. "Have you not yet found a nice pretty madchen for a bride?" His answer came'with some hesitation. "Nice pretty little maidens are'not difficult to find, but, unfortunately, they won't find me nice and pretty, too. Even Gretchen, who, when she was a wee co- quette, used to call herself my Braut, has given me up for a crusty bachelor, living, loving, suffering alone- the loved one beyond reach forever," he said in mourn- fulness, as if to himself. "By the way, where is the child?" he added, shaking himself free from thought. "Gone to the Schrannen Platz, dear Count. She ought to be back ere this." "And does she like our arrangement about the shop?" "She is as happy as a bird, and already takes all the baking business into her own hands."  &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7551-00000135"/> X 268       Xi;MSNCFTWSCO. "Now, Frau Liese, I want to know when you will be ready to return to your old home? I may be going at almost any day upon a far journey, and would wish to know you happily and comfortably settled." "And where is the Herr Count going, if I might ask?" "Certainly you might, if I could tell you. Perhaps to the far off countries of the East; perhaps away over the seas to America. But whithersoever I go, it is not probable that I shall return. Therefore I would first know you happy in your home, where you, the only one in all the world except my poor old servant, will sometimes think of, sometimes pray for me." Few words or many more might have been exchang- ed. The lady there heard nothing, leaning back mo- tionless in her chain, her face white and fixed as death. Frau Liese's gently-trickling tears stood still at sight of that face, when she returned with Gretchen. But the lady rose composedly, thanked the good dame for the water which she brought, and, followed by the gird passed swiftly/ and silently through the quiet street, to the square where her droschke yet awaited. , .

"AH! this is really the Munich of my day-dreams," exclaimed Margaret, as she and the Baron followed into the Schrannen Platz the two carriages containing the Baroness, Mille. Von Amsel, Mr. More, and Counts Zalkiewski and Falkenstein, all bound for a day in the gardens of the royal summer palace of Nymphen- burg. "How picturesquely contrasted," she said, " are those heavy-arched arcades and the small shops beneath, these stately handsome buildings in their wealth of carving and stucco, and those distant primitive wood- en booths. Are not yonder the towers of the Munich Cathedral?" "They are.   I see you are disappointed, and think them rather ugly and uncouth in this strong noontide ' light.  But when we pass them   on our return, when sunset is glowing upon their massive proportions and dome-like summits, changing the dusky red brick into an enchanted edifice of purple and gray, clothed upon by the mists of evening, you will agree with me that  &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7551-00000136"/> 270         Misco. 70N-TGENISCO. no style of building could be more imposing or har- monize so well with the strange old streets surround- ing. That fountain," pointing with the whip, as he spoke, toward the end of the street, "is the scene of the Metzger Sprung. You have heard of that, per- haps?"- "No, never. Do tell me about it." "An ancient ceremony, dating back to the sixteenth century, when Munich was ravaged by the plague. While the panic-stricken city lay hushed as the grave, in from the green fields came a procession of coopers, with garlands and gay music, and danced through the deserted streets, calling upon the inhabitants to join them. The city, awakened from the dead, was soon one scene of mad revel; and excitement, banishing de- spondency, banished also disease.' I know not whether the medical faculty would prescribe the remedy, but the cure is well attested by tradition. In remem- brance of it, the dance, the Schaffler Tanz, is reenacted every seven years. The Metzger Sprung originated at the same period, and from the same cause. The plague having thus suddenly abandoned its posses- sions, a ban'd of butchers assembled -here in the mark- et-place, and, after various preliminary ceremonies, leaped into the fountain, by way of proving to the pop- ulace that the waters were no longer tainted. This 'Butchers' Leap' is repeated yearly. Imagine these silent streets echoing jests and shouts of laughter, as, seven merry mermen, quondam  butchers, endowed with many calves' tails in lieu of the one dolphin's, flounder in the fountain, unweariedly deluging the eager crowds." "And when does this take place? Shall I see it?"   INGEMSCO.        2 1 Margaret asked, as fountain and Schrannen Platz to- gether disappeared round a corner. "In holy week; and of course you will see it. You will not think of leaving us this winter?" Margaret sighed. She dared not anticipate a single day, and those intervening months were a blank which thought could not fill up. Almost silently they drove on until the outskirts of the city were gained. "Look," cried Margaret, rousing herself from her abstraction; " can that be Aimee's carriage standing before that factory? There is no one in it." "Yon factory is the great bronze foundry, where the fire broke out last night. Our party must have fol- lowed the crowd in. Would you like to go, too? We can see nothing of the Bavaria, of course, but may hear something." The stream of people flowed in across the inclosure to the larger of the two buildings it contained, where was the casting-room of the Bavaria. Margaret looked around with interest upon the fur- nace growing dark after the intense heat of the night before, upon the great iron-covered pit for the casting of the gigantic Bavaria's bust, and up to the black- ened rafters of the lofty roof above, where tiny spark- les of dying-out fire glowed against the darkness. The Baron entered into conversation with one of the workmen, and Margaret listened as the man told how, for five days and four nights, there had been in- cessant fear and watching lest fire should break out; and how on the last evening, spite of all their care, it had done so. And he described how they had labored on till midnight, continually stirring the molten metal,  &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7551-00000137"/> 272        INGEMSCO. to prevent adhesion to the furnace walls, while fire smouldered above in the rafters, kept down only by wet cloths, for the use of water, with that burning mass beneath, would have caused the instant destruc- tion of the building and the lives within. At mid- night, however, the great work was accomplished, the bust of the Bavaria cast, and all turned to the extin- guishing of the fire. For his part, the man added, his life long would he remember that eleventh of October. When Margaret and the Baron issued from the foundry precincts, the other carriage was no longer in view. Through villages and past queer old farmhouses they continued, entering at last an avenue, where, through the long vista of interlacing boughs, brilliant in autumnal coloring, uprose the white, semi-circular palace of Nymphenburg. After the tour of inspection through this, and hear- ing at last of the fugitives, Margaret and her compan- ion proceeded to the gardens. "Do not let us play any longer at this game of hide and seek," Margaret said at length, as, after saunter- ing on, admiring the many charms of nature and art so gracefully combined in these regal gardens, she sank, weary, upon a rustic bench. But the neighboring sound of voices, and the un- mistakable, clear, joyous ring of Aim6e's laughter came at that moment--a summons which was followed. It was a lovely spot, that which they had chosen-a bright tiny glen where terraces swept downward to a fountain gleaming greenly in its white basin, beneath the shadows of fir and laurel, sequestering it above and around from the outer world.   -INGOEMSCO.       273 O Countess Zalkiewski!" cried Mille. Von Amsel, as, after mutual explanations, Margaret came to her side; " you do not know how profitably I have em- ployed the hour of waiting for you. M. More has been giving me Irish lessons." "Of what description, Mr. More? Most Irish les- sons, of which I have heard, consisted of instructions in the use of the shillalah. Surely you have not been teaching Mle. Von Amsel that." "Mle. Von Amsel is skilled in weapons far more dangerous. But she has actually progressed as far as Erin go bragh." "Now, M. More," cried Kathe, playfully indignant, "you do not give me credit for one half my learning. Can I not say my own name, Fraulein Kathe, Kath- leen Mavourneen, and-and   " She stopped short in vexation. Margaret had glanced at Mr. More, the -corners of her mouth twitch- ing the while. And as she met his deprecating glance, and observed the color mount to his brow, while around his mouth also was a, suspicious movement, she 'broke into peals of merry laughter. Mle. Von Amsel looked inquiringly from the one to the other. "I pray you, pardon the Countess," Mr. More very gravely apologized. "She laughs most unmercifully at every thing Irish, and even her friends can not es- cape. Is it not so, Countess?" "I trust Mile. Von Amsel will not think of my seem- ing rudeness," Margaret said, recovering composure. "I have so often laughed with and at Mr. More, that  " Aim6e cut short her apology,  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7551-00000138"/> 274        INGElISCO. "Eh, Marguerite, cela ne presse point-let me rather tell you of such a pretty puzzle we tried at the Cha- misso's the other night, when you were too lazy or too provoking to go, and Max here remained to encourage you in your perversity, and we lost M. le Comte upon the way, so that Louis and I were the only initiated, and the poor dear Baron has forgotten it beyond the shadow of a doubt. Your discussion on names re- minded me of it. What is in a name? I think they called it. Come, shall we not have it? For we are all growing undeniably stupid. Louis, do you remem- ber?" "I remember being greatly puzzled, but the puzzle I have forgotten. You must not call on me for assist- ance." "Etourdi! Assistance -is precisely what I do not want. - But I do want your pencil-and a leaf from your note-book. I know you generally carry one." "Unfortunately to-day is an exception," he returned, giving her the pencil alone, after an unsuccessful search for the note-book. "You, Max?" she asked. "Not I. Memoranda are nothing to me. All I strive for is forgetfulness." It was uttered carelessly, but there followed a glance toward Margaret who sat beside the fountain, ErnSt standing near. Ernst started when Aimee applied to him, and she had to enter into explanation as if she had not spoken before.- Then he drew forth a letter unaddressed- unfolded, and tearing off the blank side, gave it to her.- The other page, which was closely written, he replaced, but had hardly done so when he took it out   INGEMSCO .        275 again. He paused, while a heavy shade of thought darkened his brow. And then he tore it into frag- ments and set his heel upon them, crushing them down into the mossy turf. It needed not his fierce hard breathing as he did so, to flush Margaret's cheek with a passion she did not understand. For the wind had seized one of these fragments, a slip longer than the others, and whirled it away, and laid it there be- fore her feet. Unsuspectingly her eyes had dropped upon it. Could she mistake-or was there, in that free German hand she knew so well, an Ai written at the end of the line, where the rest was torn abruptly off? She sat there unable to withdraw her gaze, dizzy and faint and trembling, until Ernst's slight move- ment at some words from Aimee roused her.  "Now," she had said, while her audience gathered interested around, "I must have all your names. Eh, va-t-en, Max, of course I know. But yours, M. More?" "Rory O'Tlanagan O'Doherty O'Halloran Bally- walter Donaghadee Carrickfergus astore," quizzed he, somewhat ashamed of his patronymic Dermot. "O le pauvre enfant!" exclaimed Aimee, uplifting brows and hands. "Mais, monsieur, as there are so many O's, may it not be en regle that an exclamation point may stand for all?" ' "But one objection, madame; 'alas' has the self-same point. But I'll waive that pointed argument." "And your name, Count Zalkiewski-what do you call him, Marguerite?" "My name is Ernst Ivar," he interposed quickly. "Ernst! Ah bah! pardon, monsieur, but that is really too stern for ears polite. Ivar is musical-I  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7551-00000139"/> 276        INGEMSCO. shall write you down- Ivar. Now the Baron's name is Ludwig, but German gutturals, I do assure you, serve me only for scolding purposes, and-when I am in good humor he is Louis. I hope, mignonne," to Margaret, "you will never call your husband by that harsh first name." "Never," replied Margaret, in a tone so sharp and constrained that it startled herself. "That name to me is associated only with--one long since dead. And that name is silent on my lips while the dead is dead." She repented of her speech the instant it was utter- ed, for Falkenstein looked up in quick inquiry from her to Ernst. He was unmoved. She could read no emotion in the immobility of the firm-set mouth, and the calm gaze not averted from her, but passing her by and resting on the ripple of the fountain. "My pencil-I have dropped it," Aimne said, re- turning to her occupation at Kathe's impatient sug- gestion. There was some disturbance consequent upon its disappearance, and a general search began. A vain search, until the Baroness suggested to Margaret that it might have rolled her way. Margaret rose. Yes, there it was, safe beneath a fold of her dress. She stooped for it, and there, side by side, her hand came in contact with that fragment of paper, swept nearer by her movements. Quick as thought-yet not be- fore thought came, self-scorn and horror for her deed-- she snatched it up with the pencil, clenched her little hand upon it until the' nails drew blood from the tender palm, and waited with a shudder of impatience, a whirl of deadly fear, until the moment when she might read   INGEMSC.         2" unobserved. Conscience whispered to cast away the temptation, to trample it under foot, even as he had done, to dishonor not herself thus willfully. But the clamor in her heart rose against and drowned the voice of conscience. They were all round Aimee now-even Ernst, to whom she had beckoned. She had summoned Mar- garet too, but she, pleading ,her throbbing headache, remained where she was, alone. Stifling the upbraidings of her conscience, she rested her elbow on the edge of the fountain, shading her eyes with one hand, while with the other she softly straightened out the paper, and read: "By the ties time has broken, and you forgotten, Ai--'" It was all. And it was the death-wound in her heart. Not that she feared him. She had seen in his eyes, when he destroyed the paper, the utter de- struction of all that it contained. -Not that for one moment she distrusted AimBe.  She knew that the past, whatsoever of joy or woe it had brought and taken away, crossed not the threshold of her heart again. She knew not why her pulses all stood still while her brain was reeling. She thought that it was hate-if she thought at all. She sat on, motionless, her face ashen in its darkness, her bright smiles all burnt out; until his step drew near, his voice said something, and the blood flew up to her very brow. All were setting forth for a tour around the gar- dens. All but. Margaret, who, still urging headache, and setting aside rather peremptorily all offers to re- main with her, promised not to move until their re- turn.  &#xD;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7551-00000140"/> 278        INGEMSCO. But the Baron took possession of the unoccupied seat on her bench. "Will you let me stay with you?" he asked, when she turned with the friendly smile she always had for him. "Ramble and ride in this October sun al- ready suffice for a stout elder like myself. You are wise-our friends must find their way back to us. While you remain stationary like the lode-star, Zal- kiewski may enact compass for them." Her only reply was an unconscious curl of the lip. The Baron observed her intently before he said: "Countess, are we friends-true friends?" "It is great gladness to me to believe it," was the earnest response. "Will you then accord me a friend's privilege of candor?" She questioned him with a long, wondering gaze, that fell suddenly, answered, as he went on: "It grieves me to see you unhappy, and I fear me, my poor child, you are preparing for yourself an un- happy future. You have a noble husband, one who is admired and esteemed by all who know him, and whose love is such that not all are worthy to feel or to receive. Will you chill its warmth-will you lower its loftiness by schooling yourself to a lower standard than that which he now sees in you? Love is long-suffering-in natures like Zalkiewski's, eternal. But if trampled upon, -crushed into the dust, it must contract some earth-stain." She did not speak, but bowed her face down upon the cold marble of the fountain, and hid it there. 'It is hard to grieve thee thus, thou poor one;   INGEMSCO.        279 but I have seen the blight gain ground day by day, and no true friend could remain silent.5" Still she replied not, only shivered and shrank back. He spoke again, most tenderly. "Let me warn you against endeavoring to arouse your husband's jealousy. You may never measure the anguish in your power to inflict. There are those who would die rather than lay bare to careless or tri- umphant eyes their wounded hearts. If aught stand between two who are bound by duty and affection, what matter -by which the obstacle be removed? If by the one innocent of wrong, is pride more powerful than love? If by the erring one, can not every noble heart forgive and forget too?" "Never, never-he has no right-he who---"Mar- garet cried, starting up flushed and trembling with passion-trembling yet more, and speech dying on her lips, as she saw her husband close beside her. She attempted to pass him in the narrow pathway, and he drew back while he said gently: "Unavoidably I have overheard your last words. You will pardon me that, Margaret." She inclined her head for answer, and he stood-un- til the last- flutter of her dress was lost amid the shrub- bery. Then he strode up to the Baron, and laying a heavy hand upon his shoulder, spoke sternly and haughtily: "Hear me, sir. I permit no mediation between my, wife and myself. What explanation can you give of this unwarrantable liberty?" The Baron reddened with anger at first, but pres- ently he replied good-humoredly:  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7551-00000141"/> 280        tNGEfTSCO. "You must not condemn unheard an over-zealous friend. You must pardon me in that I can not avoid observing all is not right with Margarethe. I have seen her pale and dispirited at times, and at times recklessly gay, as if resolved to brave some heavy trouble. I imagined, from her gentle friendliness to me, that I possessed some influence with her, and, seeing where lay the evil, endeavored, it may be mis- takenly, to remove it." Ernst made no reply, but paced up and down the graveled path. "You say she is pale," he said at length abruptly. "Do you think her ill?" "Ifl in mind, not in body." "C Advise me what to do." "I can only say to you that which I have already said to her. If you have wronged her, ask her for- giveness-if she has wronged you, forgive her un- asked." "She said well-I have no right to speak' of for- giveness," broke from Ernst as he turned away with a heavy sigh. "Zalkiewski, my dear fellow," said the Baron, fol- lowing after and detaining him; 1" don't despair thus. It is impossible that she does not love you, and, lov- ing you, she must sooner or later forgive." Ernst forced himself into perfect calmness. - "I owe it to her," he said, "that her hold upon any remaining friend should not be weakened by me; therefore I will tell you a11. It is the only expiation in my power. "I know not whether you have heard our marriage was what is called a runaway match, which generally    INrnsco.         281 presupposes blind love upon the woman's side, clear- sighted villainy taking advantage of that blindness on- the man's, especially if he happen to be much the elder. In this case it was slightly different, the dif- ference being clear-sighted love and blind villainy. Ay, you are right to draw back from me. I care not. Who feels the sting of Phame, when tortured by remorse?" "You misunderstand me," Waldien hastened to in- terpose; "it was but astonishment I felt. Here is some strange mistake. I will answer for your honor with my life." "Then is your life little worth," was the cold re- ply. "What think you of the honor which would permit a man meeting a powerless girl upon a lonely mountain, to force her with threats-and threats which at that moment from his soul he meant-to break a promise to the living, a solemn oath to the dead, in giving her word to marry him immediately? What think you of the generosity of soul which could resist the prayers, the tears, the agony of the helpless, and inexorably force the marriage before God's high altar, estranging her from all she loved?" "From all?" "I have said from all. She loved one whom she deemed honorable. When she knew him honorable no longer she loved him no longer. She foresaw-- she warned." Waldien grasped his hand. "You are an inexorable judge," he said. "I still answer for your honor. If by one fall we sank for- ever, who of us would stand?" Ernst silently returned the earnest pressure.    .                      ,  &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7551-00000142"/> 282         INGEMSCO, "And Margarethe?" the Baron asked after a pause. "I have taken from her all that renders life endur able. The past I have made unreal as a dream-the present a weariness-the future a void." "If she loved you--" the Baron suggested. "I know what you would say," interrupted Ernst, "(but you mistake her. Were she less strong in char- acter and heart, she might, as you thought, love me the more that I dared, commit a crime for her sake. But Margaret' is too pure, too proud, to love where she can not trust. I do not hope. I have not, since that day, hoped for that. To see her at peace and con- tent, is all my aim now." "And will her family not forgive her?" "Margaret has written but once, and that once merely announcing her marriage, without explanation. She forbade my writing; nevertheless, I have I con- stantly done so. Contrary to her generous intention, I have explained all. But notwithstanding that my pride was laid thus low, there has been no answer. Lately I have learned, fortuitously, that her mother is at Naples, and my last letter was directed thither. It is just possible my former ones may have miscar- ried. Her mother may relent in time. Until then there is no escape from the misery I have wrought. Then--" he ended in a husky voice. "Then all will be happy again," the Baron conclud- ed, with attempted cheerfulness. Ernst quietly shook his head. "All will be right and just," he said, "not happy.

THE crimson curtains were drawn, and the draw- ing-room brilliant with light, exquisite frescoes, and a gay though small assembly. Mille. Von Amsel, assisted by the hostess, Baroness Waldien, was seated at a card-table, initiating into the mysteries of German cards, Mr. More, -rhose con- fusion among acorns, bells, trifles, and armed cham- pions, created not a little amusement. The Countess Zalkiewski, seated apart, listlessly turned over the leaves of some music which Count Falkenstein had brought, listening and now and then replying to him with scarce concealed nonchalance. In his eyes she had never seemed so beautiful, loung- ing in her arm-chair, her black dress contrasting with its crimson cushions, and with her marble-pale face and warm brown hair that, parted simply upon the low, broad brow, waved above the blue-veined tem- ples, and was gathered in a massive loop behind. Presently from the card-table, where merriment had   INGEMSCO.        285 given place to low-toned, eager consultation, Aimle spoke: "Marguerite, and you, cher Max, hear only what a charming scheme we have formed, or rather are form- ing. Come, join our circle and give us your assist- ance." Margaret slowly rose, and passed behind her chair, leaning upon the back. The Count, with a slight frown of annoyance, followed. "What is in the wind now?"Margaret asked. "Private theatricals. Only think of it! Is it not an idea a ravir? You know, Marguerite, we can have 'the ball-room fitted up with a stage, and the reception and drawing-rooms will do for dancing, for Kiathe and I are determined not to dispense with that. Of the conservatory we can make quite an enchanted palace, and Herr Wolfmeister will arrange the scenery. *ly 'dear five hundred friends,' as you call them, will be willing spectators, and the only point now to be de- cided is the choice of a play." "Quite an important point, is it not? * It must be neither too long nor too short, too complicated nor too simple, too sentimental nor too matter-of-fact. In short, not too any thing." Perhaps," said Count Falkenstein, "I have. that which might at least answer to Countess Zalkiewski's catalogue of negative excellences. It is a drama writ- ten by an old college friend of mine, a story upon which his after-fate was a mournful commentary, and which armed the hand that sacrificed his happiness." "How was that?"Margaret asked, interested. "The lady of his heart was placed in a position similar to that of thelady of his drama. She had read  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7551-00000144"/> 286        ING CMTSCO. this, admired and followed the heroine, leaving the lover to his own devices. I assure you, the story is' not wanting in plot." "And what became of the lover, the real one?" "Ah, Madame la Comtesse, why in the name of all that is romantic do you ask that? Of course I ought to reply, died of a broken heart. But alas! truth com- pels me to state that wandering in search of forgetful- ness, he found it, returned and married a wealthy bour- geoise, and is now the owner of an extensive Augs- burg brewery." ( The Countess finds that beer sour indeed," laughed Mr. More. "Well, Falkenstein, will the play be forth- coming?" "On one condition," Falkenstein replied. ' If the Countess Zalkiewski will do me the favor and my frind the honor of enacting the principal role." "Do not make that your condition," Margaret re- turned, "for I most decidedly decline any part save that of spectator." All joined in the outcry against this; but Margaret persisted until she met Ernst's eyes fixed anxiously upon her. He had been standing apart with moody brow, watching Aimee. :But he started as he caught the thread of the neighboring discussion. Margaret's color deepened, and she returned his glance defiantly. "I revoke my refusal, and will take any part you may choose to give me," she said in a tone audible, as intended, to her husband. 'He saw her a moment after turn away and gather up the music she had been looking over. He crossed the room and was at her side while yet Count Fal- *   iNGRMTSCO.        287 kenstein, impatiently polite, was detained to answer Mile. Von Amsel's eager questionings about the drama--were the characters in the beau monde?--in past or present days?-for it is so important because of the costume. "Are you going to the music-room?"Ernst asked of Margaret. She assented, and they moved on together, entering the spacious alcove rather than apartment, appearing to the drawing-room a perfect bower where ivy, be- loved of the German, festooned the arched entrance and drooped vailing the piano. Ernst arranged Margaret's music and turned the leaves while she played one of Mozart's sorrowful so- natas. Then as she ended, and her fingers strayed lightly over the notesof a simple prelude, he spoke, fixing his eyes upon her downcast face. "You must be aware of my reason for thus intrud- ing upon you. It is earnestly to request that you do not act in these theatricals." Her eyes were still bent upon the keys while she answered coldly: "I have promised." "You surely can withdraw. It is not yet too late." Then after a pause, during which she continued to play without looking at him, he resumed: "If you will not, unconvinced of its needfulness, grant me this, you must allow me to give my reason.-- Doubtless yon will be obliged 'to act with Count Falkenstein, who will construe your compliance as a mark of personal favor. This you would not willingly give to a man who still cherishes the old feeling, stronger than friendship, for you."  &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7551-00000145"/> 288,        INGEMSCO. "He never felt it," was the quick reply. "Can you not see that he both did and does? Mar- garet, I*warn you." She raised her head now, her cheek flushing and her eyes flashing. "Sir, I have need of no warning," she said haughtily. "No need of warning from you. I will not withdraw my promise upon grounds that are to me insufficient and insulting." And down came her fingers vehemently upon the fourth false chord. "Qu' as-tu, ma mie? Or is the piano bewitched? Give us a song, if you are weary of playing," cried Aimke from the drawing-room. Margaret immediately began Mignon's Kennst du das Land, and as the last notes died away, she rose from the piano, and before Ernst could have detain- ed her, even if he had so wished, returned to the drawing-room, where all now surrounded the Bar- oness.

"HUSE! the curtain is rising!" Silence falls, as, revealing the stage to the three or four hundred eyes appertaining to the Baroness Wal- dien's friends, the curtain rose upon a palace-hall of the middle ages. Its gray stone walls are hung in storied tapestry where gallant knights and fair dames reduplicate the court assembled. There, upon the dais, behind which stalwart armored spearsmen range, is throned the crowned and sceptred Harald of Den- mark. And now through a rude arched entrance is. winding a procession. Foremost, an ancient cowled monk, leading by the hand a maiden of royal rank, as would seem from her tiara of pearls, and no less from her stately bearing, although her eyes are lowered modestly. Her flowing hair is braided with pearls, and the ermine tunic over her gold-broidered robe is fastened upon either shoulder by clusters of those gems, leaving the round white arms quite bare. In this first scene yon reverend monk intrusts the Princess Gunhilda to the gentle protection of King Harald, until such time as her betrothed shall have   INGEMSCO.           291 returned from distant wars and she be claimed by him and her own Norway.            / From   this time the tale speeds on until protector and protected, oblivious both of the absent warrior, fall madly in love. Then is the awaking. In the grand old castle park, Harald, in hunting- dress, is walking with Gunhilda.   The love long burn- ing in his eyes is there spoken passionately. One moment she listens, the next, with a stifled moan, starts hurriedly away. But he grasps her hand, and cries: "We may not part!" Steadfast her reply: "Ay, though our severed hearts bleed e'en to death. This may we not;-we may not break our faith- May not, in life's stern warfare, recreant turn, And, trembling, flee the battle. If our hearts Faint with despair, stand still, we'll tear them out. Cast them on, on, beyond the fearful field Where corses stiffen and tHte wounded shriek, And Sorrow grapples with us, to the foot Of that White Throne where God of hosts awaits To crown all victors with the crown of life. ,  There only may our hearts meet innocent, Till the great trumpet end the fearful fray, 'And we clasp hands upon the conquered field, Never, O Harald I never more to part." Ernst in his watching sees no longer Norwegian princess, but Margaret Ross-no longer towers of the palace castle or distant ocean view, but a lonely moun- tain, towering cliffs, a silver-gleaming lake. And he knows that in Gunhilda's words speaks Margaret as she spoke in vain that morning neither may forget. And he fancies, or is it fancy? that in the last line,  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7551-00000147"/> 292         INRGEWTSCO. when her voice falters at the name of Harald, it is that another name trembled on her lips. Perhaps another too may deem the thrilling tones, the changing color, the earnestness of look and ges- ture, not all bestowed upon far-away sorrows of the traditionary Gunhilda. Perhaps he may think the hand, slowly withdrawn from his own, not Gunhilda's waving aside in agony the love of Harald, but Marga- ret's that of Falkenstein. Gunhilda alone is there in the succeeding scenes, noble in her mute fortitude- brave in her firm a-void. ance of the irresolute Harald. Came at last the longed- for and yet- dreaded tidings--the warrior-betrothed is returning, will on the morrow claim his bride. There is a wild scene between that bride and the king. He entreats, reasons, and finally threatens. Whereupon she is no more the sorrow-stricken sup- pliant, but the brave, high-hearted woman, scorn in her flashing eyes and on her brow as she turns and leaves him silently. ErAst has seen all this before. She resolves to escape, and that night she and her faithful bowerwoman, having eluded the vigilance of the sentinel, glide forth in disguise from the castle gates and hurriedly pursue their" way. Suddenly they are surrounded by a masked and muffled guard. The attendant clings to and refuses to leave her mis- tress, until a blow fells her senseless to the earth. The princess is borne off, a gauntleted hand upon her mouth stifling her cries. The next scene is a lonely moor. Moonlight dimly defines a pathway between treacherous morasses, and g imnners cold and faint upon the turgid- flood almost overhanging, yet barred back by a sluice from a pit   INGEMSCO.          293 down which the trunk of a gnarled and knotted tree has still retained its place. There the captive is re- leased. She stands in her white robes among those dark men, her figure drawn up, her arms crossed upon her bosom-pale, but regarding     them   in steadfast calm.  There is a pause.  Then forth from the group strides one wrapt in a large mantle, having his face concealed, and demands if the princess now -consents to obey the will of the king? She simply answers, Never. He warns her she is utterly in his power, can hope for no rescue, and for no mercy if she still refuse; and repeats his question. Now less than be- fore-is her reply. A mute sign to the muffled band and they seize the proud maiden, hurry her forward, and bind her, unresisting, to the broken tree in the dismal hollow.    Once again the leader repeats his question.   She turns fearlessly, and her words are spoken with quiet scorn, broken anon by passionate utterances: "I die to-night-- But hear me yet one instant ere I die. Harald, I know thee. Nay, why turn away? Fearst thou I'll sue to thee? Nay, not one breath. Dreadest thou to meet ' Gunhilda's empress eyes,' Those I violets in the shade,' 'twin-stars of love '? They shall not plead one glance from out the past, For, king, I know thee-not alone unmasked Before my sight--revealed unto my heart. I dreamed thee noble--knew thee something stern, Determined, reckless in thy purposes: Thought I, the stronger in defense of right, The nobler champion in the cause of truth, The firmer lover, faithful beyond time. Thus went my dream. To-night I am awake, And by the light of near eternity I see-oh I would to heaven I were blind!"  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7551-00000148"/> 294         ING ISCO. She paused, bowing her head upon her fettered hands. Then lifting it proudly, said: Awaitest thou mine answer? Do thy worst- Death is not deadlier now than life to me." And the gates of the sluice stand open, and the stagnant tide is slowly, surely overflowing into the dismal hollow. The murderous band without glance or word retraces the winding way, and the curtain falls, concealing the pale upraised face and clasped hands of the martyr upon Honor's altar. While the guests, now released from auditorial si- lence, are discussing the merits of play and players, and the artistic management of stage illusions, the hero and heroine, behind the scenes, are enacting en caracttre an after-piece-scarcely a farce, however, or intended for the public diversion. Margaret sat alone in an alcove of the conservatory. A luxuriant white jasmine formed a bower there, and a fountain played before, the plashing Of the waters softly accompanying strains of music from the adjacent ball-rooms. Her elbow -rested on the marble basin and her chin within her palm, while she followed dreamily the falling spray. The white death-robes of the prin- cess had, contrary to the generally accepted style of resurrection-robes, been replaced by one of black vel- vet, high in the throat. The sole trace of the ill- fated Norwegian was that the flowing sleeves were, like hers, open to the shoulder, and confined there by the same pearls she had worn. And a graceful spray of pearly star-blossoms fastened the red-brown heir, passing from the forehead across the twist behind.   INGEMSCO.        295 Her face was troubled as she sat there, and more than the old heavy sorrow weighed upon her. -She now bitterly reproached herself, for the false pride which had pledged her to the trial and the shame of this evening. For although reiterated :plaudits as- sured her of Gunhilda's complete success, yet shame overwhelmed in that she had, albeit shrinkingly, laid bare her inmost heart to one who possessed the key by which to read it only too well. Exultation had no part in her thoughts as the surging sea of heads wavered yet before her mind. One stern, sorrowful face only was present. "Has my captive then escaped her watery prison?" suddenly asked a voice at her side. She started. "May the king live!" was her rejoinder. "The waters have given up their prey." "A grand success, was it not? That water-I had very nearly redeemed Harald's character when I saw it pouring down so fearfully upon you. Almost as overwhelming as the compliments since pouring down on me," he added, seating himself carelessly on the fountain's brink. "Undoubtedly a great troupe," she said with forced gayety. -CAnd you-I think you said you had not acted before--but surely I must have deceived myself." "Never. I doubt if I could again." Falkenstein hesitated. He reddened and looked eagerly into Margaret's agitated face. He bit his lip until the blood sprang, striving to keep back the words that came at last abruptly. "Yours is not acting--it is being. You are Gunhilda.'  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7551-00000149"/> 296        INGMEISCO. "It was scarcely acting." It was almost a bitter -gasp that forced itself thus from her quivering lips. She averted her head, but not before Falkenstein saw a tear steal from beneath the lowered lashes. At that sight all self-command abandoned him, and leaning forward he cried hurriedly: ( That tear-is it for yourself alone?" Annoyed at having been observed, she turned not, nor answered. "Do you not pity-not sorrow for me?" "For you?" and she looked up in unfeigned aston- ishment., Ay, for me. May no thought, no tear, be won by the love of my whole soul?"  Her eyes flashed fire, and she half rose. But she dropped upon her seat again, hiding her face in her hands. Falkenstein-was perfectly confounded. That glance of scorn unutterable-could he so have misinterpreted her evident agitation through the play, and was her love but a vain dream? And yet why that passionate weeping-why did she not send him from her side? Could she ever' pardon? He resolved to speak to her. !"Ah! forgive  " "Yes-yes-I forgive," she gasped between her sobs. "Only go--go! You have insulted, you have humiliated me in the very dust-but I know, I know the fault is mine. I would not see-I would not hear-I was mad, recklessly mad and wicked. Had I loved you, I might perchance dream of excuse. I have none. No, no--" she cried, as in his distress he drew nearer and would have spoken. "Leave me in-   INGEHSCO.        'Ui stantly-forget-forgive me.  1 can never forgive myself. Go-go-" and she rose, stamping her foot imperatively. Without one word, with but one agonized remorse- ful glance, he went despairingly forth out into the darkness of the night. And Margaret? She stood motionless until there came a step behind her. She turned, and with a wild cry threw herself into her husband's arms, clinging to him, imploring to be takeh away-anywhere, any- where-only far away. Ernst had entered the conservatory by one door as Falkenstein had left it by another, therefore he was at a loss for the cause' of Margaret's emotion. He asked no questions, however. "Poor child!" he thought. A c( Heaven help her, she can fly to none other refuge. now. Therefore, and therefore only, she comes to me. This shall not be. I here vow to rest no more until she is with those she loves. My love shall never again trouble her." And his manner, tender as to a child, had in it no more of passion. When Margaret reentered the ball-room, upon her husband's arm, it had been arranged between them that the morrow's sun should shine upon their home- ward way.  &#xD;<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7551-00000150"/> XxV. *THEY sin who tell us love can die- With life all other passions fly- All others are but vanity.'" "WEARY, Margaret? See, we are nearly at the end of our journey." Margaret started when her husband spoke, and rais- ing herself from the carriage cushions where she had been resting silently with closed eyes, watched from the window the lights glimmering from Castle Egeri, beacons through the gathering darkness. "How bright it is! - Quite as if we were expected," she exclaimed, and he saw a flitting smile in the moonlight, a smile mournful as that moonlight. He heard, and a sudden thought, a hope, a deadly fear, seized him. He said no more, but grew restless and impatient until the carriage stopped and Margaret stood by his side at the foot of the ascent winding up to the castle heights. She took his proffered arm and slowly and wearily, mounted the stone flight of the brow of the cliff- wea- rily, not with bodily fatigue, but with that blank hope- lessness of the future beneath the weight of which, daily heavier, she sank. On reaching the cloisters she withdrew her hand   IrGEEMSCO.       299 from his arm, shading her eyes from  the light which streamed from the uncurtained library win- dows. "Are you waiting for your maid?" -Ernst asked. "She and Fritz appeared to have an endless task be- fore them in gathering together the contents of the carriage. .Their very friendly terms do not expedite matters. Shall I send to hasten her?" "No," Margaret answered, seating herself upon the low balustrade. "I do not want her, I will merely rest here a moment--the moon is so lovely upon the lake. Do not let me detain you," she added, without looking toward him; but back into another evening not long past, when the lights from the Waldien man- sion had gleamed thus across the portico where he was standing, and she greeting from the windows the stars peeping out at her for the last time from Munich clouds, heard him sigh heavily, "O Aimee, my little Aimee!" He moved away into the shadow, watching her. "For the last time, it must be so," he thought. She had removed her bonnet, and as she sat there gazing down upon the waters, her features almost in profile, the hair waving low'upon her pale cheek, the mantle of her gray traveling-dress thrown back, her hands lying listless in her lap, in the very attitude of Evangeline, Ernst was reminded of the evening when in the cottage garden at Lowerz he had spoken of the resemblance. "God guard you from the misery of that expression," which was now habitual to her eyes, since they had softened once for all for him on that last evening at Munich. From   the garden his thoughts strayed into the cottage parlor, where he  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7551-00000151"/> INGEMSCO. heard again her strong and earnest words, and felt the touch of her hand in his. Soon was he awakened from his dream. Margaret rose, clasping ier hands across her brow. " I can not, oh! I can not bear it," she moaned, " and the end-weeks, months, years, and- it may still be distant !" Ernst came quickly to her side. "Thou poor one," he said, "grieve not-fear not. The end is not far off-is even now at hand." She raised her head and their eyes met. Hers were full oA tears. "The end, the end?" she repeated! "Ah! I re- member now. And you too, even you, desert me- you leave me all alone. No mother, no sister, no-" and turning away she burst into tears. Ernst was mystified. He saw she did not under- stand his meaning, and was at an entire loss as to hers. But when he attempted to explain, she recov- ered herself and interrupted. "Forgive me if I have pained you," she said softly, "I did not know you were near. And now let us see what provident fairy has warned your good Zozia of our return." She gave him her traveling shawl and led the way to the library. He laid his hand upon the lock. "One word," he said hurriedly, bending down to- ward her, "whatsoever befall, will you-will you en- deavor not quite to hate, only to forget me ?" She colored and cast down her eyes. " I see you have not forgotten my childishness just now. You must not think of it.  I was so weary." He opened the door.   One moment she stood dazzled by the blaze of light. The next, she sprang forward with a wild cry. Ernst quietly closed the door. For Margaret had no more need of him. She had found her refuge, her mother's bosom. Margaret sat upon a low chair at her mother's feet. Her head rested upon her mother's lap, and her moth- er's hand lingeringly stroked and put back the heavy braids of her hair. Upon a sofa reclined a fair, graceful woman, to meet whose smile Margaret often turned. Alice moved restlessly about the room, now stoop- ing, half crying for joy, to give Margaret a loving hug, and anon listening at every distant sound for a step that came not. At length she cried impatiently, "Where on earth is your husband-our brother? Why does he not come to greet us ?" Margaret was silent until her mother laid her hand upon her shoulder, saying, "Where is he, darling? I have not yet seen him, and Jeanie and he are old friends, you know." Margaret looked with quick inquiry into the moth- er's face. " Go and find him, child," she said. The wife rose. As she passed Jeanie's sofa, her sis- ter caught her hand in both hers, and drawing her down, whispered: "Tell him one awaits who has now a stronger claim than that of auld acquaintance.'" Margaret glanced from one to the other in utter be- wilderment as she left the room. She returned alone, saying that one of the servants &#xD;<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7551-00000152"/> 802     1NGEMFISCOo had seen his master leave the house. She supposed he would return ere long. C"It is already so much beyond invalid hours," Mrs. Ross said, consulting her watch, "that I must wait no more." "Dear 'manma, have they made you comfortable? How long did you say you have been here?"Mar- garet asked as she accompanied her mother to the door. "Since Wednesday, .my child. And I have been perfectly comfortable. Your old housekeeper, despite grim looks, is most attentive." "Coming, Alice?" Margaret held out her hand to her. "And you, Lady Jean?" "No. I'll stay here until you return, which must be the moment your hostess duties are performed. MVamma needs rest, you know, so leave that sleepy child with her, and do you come down to me." So in half an hour she came down. -Her sister was standing at the window with a smile upon her lips, which brightened as she advanced and put her arm round Margaret. "Has our inquisitive Madge lost all her curiosity? Do you not remember what an inquiring mind the child was wont to display when her grown-up sister arrived at home from a visit to Edinburgh or London? And does she not now care to penetrate the mystery of our arrival?" Margaret's manner changed. The trouble returned. "Do not let us talk of that, dear Jeanie. Tell me rather of Donald, of your little Maude." I'What more can I tell than I have already told?

"What letter?"Margaret asked quickly. "Aha! I thought curiosity was not dead, but sleep- ing. What letter? 'thereby hangs a tale' too long to be told standing. Come and sit beside me on the sofa, and you shall know."  Seated there, she drew forth a letter which she put into Margaret's hands. Margaret hesitated. "Yes, read it," Jeanie said, smiling and nodding. And Margaret read. Her color changed, repeatedly until, reaching the end, she hid 'her face upon her sis- ter's shoulder, sobbing. The letter ran thus: "MUNIcH, Oct. 5th. "By the memory of your daughter's childhood, Madame, throw not this letter aside unread. As you value her very life, hear me. "In my former letters I have striven to exonerate her, deeming it needless to inculpate myself fully and at length. Now, I state the whole truth. "I have told you that our marriage was one of abso- lute force, compelled by the power of the strong over the physically weak. On that morning I met her by chance upon a lonely mountain. More than a month was then gone by since I told her of my love and she had left me without hope. Convinced that her love would never be mine, I did not think to seek her farther, until that morning revealed to me her heart.

But I took ad- vantage of it to urge my suit, and when she firmly set aside my every argument, I endeavored to terrify her into submission. Hardened to her tears, to her entreaties, I used threats before which any woman would quail, and she gave her promise to become my wife, coupled with the warning that she could no longer love me. Had this promise not been given, I know that I should have borne her through the surrounding solitudes to my castle, where, unsuspected of any creature, I might have concealed her. "And now she droops daily, stricken down by'de- spair.  "If you forgive her not, she dies, and I am her mur- derer. "Madame, save your child.

Margaret's tears ceased to flow, but she did not move as she mumured: "Mamma--does she forgive both?"

But there is no bitterness in his sorrow, and he has ever been your staunch friend and champion, when there was none beside but little, faith. ful Alice. Yes, none beside, I answer those reproach- ful eyes. For your never asking forgiveness, never writing, save that one cold note, made us believe your love and grief but cold."

Silence was your only course, since to. speak was to fail in wifely duty. As to Harry, it is my hope, faint and distant indeed, and mine alone, for mamma does not think with me, that one day Alice may replace Margaret. If any may, it is she.

"The same dear comforter as of old," Margaret said, smiling through her tears.

My little sister's heart will tell her what is right. Good-night." And she folded her in a close embrace, and was gone. Margaret went to the window, and holding back one of the curtains, looked out. The lamplight, stream- ing through the stained glass, fell in warm rays upon the cloister pavement, but beyond all was dark. Rain plashed in dreary monotony upon the roof, winds moan- ed among the pines, and ever and anon lightnings lit up with fitful radiance the rocky gorges and the chaf- ing lake. Margaret shivered in vague alarm until a firm step resounded along the gallery and the door opened. Instinctively she dropped the curtain, and it fell in heavy folds around, completely concealing her. 'He went straight to an escritoire and began to write, never once pausing nor lifting his head until two letters, or rather notes, were finished and folded. Then he unlocked a desk, carefully examined and se- lected various papers, and inclosing them with the last note, sealed and directed the envelope. His face was toward Margaret, and she trembled before the anguish written there. His lips were stern- ly compressed, and his whole bearing was of one brac- ing himself for a great struggle. When he had finished the letter, he still held it for an instant, the proud resolution in his eyes relenting as they looked upon it. Then with an impatient ges- ture, he tossed it from him, and bowing his head upon his arms crossed on the table, sighed. Then Margaret glided from her involuntary conceal- ment. She laid her hand upon his arm.

She waited, her hand upon his arm.  The touch was unfelt, and he stirred not beneath it. She paused in uncertainty, and her glance fell upon the letter he had tossed from him. It was addressed to herself. Suddenly it flashed upon her what had nearly been the end of all. The words overheard in the bakery near Sendlinger Thor occurred to her, and the hour of his departure, she saw now, was that of her restora- tion to her mother. And he was leaving her without one word, without one look, with but this written farewell. The other letter, ittoo lay with the superscription uppennost-to the Baroness Waldien! The proud blood rushed to her brow. She removed her hand and turned toward the door. But one glance at the bowed figure of that strong man detained her. She could but trust in his honor-she was his wife, and her place still at his side. Love her he might not, yet she felt through her whole soul that whatsoever he didj whatsoever he wrote, she was safe in his honor, and, flushing crimson, she sank upon her knees beside him, and bowed her head also on his arm. He started up. Not so Margaret. She lay still, flushing yet more deeply beneath his gaze, her long bright lashes glistening dewily, her red lips quiver- ing in a tremulous smile.  &#xD;<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7551-00000155"/> 308        INGEMSCO.

You must forgive me. You must forget all this weary time. You must be happy onco again."  He listened incredulously. And when she rose and stood before him, her arms folded, her head bent as one awaiting her sentence, he too rose and held out his hand silently. She laid hers in it. He did not speak at first. Emotion after emotion swept over his face, as gusts cloud stormy seas. - Margaret trembled, and understood not. "Do you then fully and freely forgive?" he asked. "Even as you forgive." "And when we are parted you will think of me, when you think of me--with friendliness?" "Why should we part?" she almost whispered. He did not answer immediately. He was gathering firmness ere he spoke again: "You must not tempt me thus. Your happiness will be my comfort in my wanderings, and men, they say, forget the past in action."      . "Forget I I know that well," she thought. "Ifif--- she said timidly-then began afresh. "I am your wife, and if you -send me not from you in anger, will remain with you."

She blushed, and answered nothing. She dared not probe the recent wounds-she only knew now that not hate alone had made her misery. In her embarrassment she took up the letter address- ed to her, saying: "This is mine, is it not?" "It was for you, it is for no one now. Your for- giveness has made it no longer necessary." "May I not have it?" "As you will," he answered indifferently. She gave him her hand.  &#xD;<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7551-00000156"/> 310    r- owrcsco. "A glad good-night," she said, "and a happy mor- row. Methinks all our morrows must be happy now." And with a smile upon her lips she left him, When she had gained her turret-chamber, thrown on a white dressing-robe, and unbound her hair, she sat down and broke the seal. She read therein:. "Do you remember, Margaret, my last words to you? Whatever befalls, endeavor not to hate, only to forget me. Peace has befallen you. The love of your mother is yours once more. And I leave you, for well I know that otherwise you can not be happy. While I live shall my presence trouble you no more. When I die you will know, and then you will forgive "E. I. Z." Inclosed was a package of business papers, a glance at which showed Margaret that they served to endow her with all his property, and that they bore the same date as that last letter to her mother. She smiled in triumph, twisting them together and burning them at the flame of her lamp. When the last spark died out she -went to the window and threw it open. The storm-wind still raged, but no more it smote her heart with fear. As it blew chilly upon her brow, tossing back her hair, she felt in its fierce wrestling an element of strength, all the strength with- in her rose up to meet it, and she felt that, h oven being merciful, she could and would conquer her fate.

The first watch of the night was spent by him, not in bright dreams of the future, but in earnest preparation for daily trials which he knew awaited him. It was one thing to be calmly gentle beneath scornful glance and bitter word, knowing them the while the inevitable result of his own sin--and quite another to be stoically friendly when those sweet eyes met his kindly, and those dear lips smiled upon him. ,     \  &#xD;<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7551-00000157"/> XXV1.

'Do you indeed not regret your decision, Marga- ret? Even now it is not too late to retract, if your heart fails from remaining here alone with me. Do not hesitate to tell me." They were standing, the husband and wife, upon the' ruined parapet, and she was gazing eagerly and perhaps also somewhat tearfully, after the traveling carriage, from which, as it disappeared among the trees, Alice's handkerchief fluttered the last farewell. She turned at Ernst's words, mockingly replying, "Do you indeed not regret your decision, Ivar? Even now it is not too late to retract. Do not hesi- tate to make off to America or to Asia." Ernst regarded her in astonishment. "What do you mean?    Who could have told   " "Ah! walls have ears, Sir Count, and the walls of a certain bakery near the Sendlinger Thor especially acute ones." "Margaret!"   INGEMSCO.        313 "Herr Count!" she responded, mimicking his air of bewilderment. "What do you know of the Sendlinger Thor?" '"What do I know of the Sendlinger Thor? His- torical?"And folding her hands demurely, she con- tinued in the monotonous tone of a child repeating a lesson learned by rote: "The Sendlinger Thor is an entrance to old Munich, now fallen partly into decay. It is chiefly memorable in that there was fought the last battle of the insurrectionists in the early part of the eighteenth century. There fell the brave Sibal- dus and his gallant sons. The other leaders, save only the student Plinganser, suffered death at the hands of Austria. Saith tradition, years after, when one day the Elector hunted in the forest with his train, there met him a maimed and aged mendicant, observing whose destitution his Highness, moved with pity, in- quired his name. When he learned that it was Plin- ganser, he dismounted, placed the old hero upon his own horse, and walked beside him bareheaded into the city, through the same Sendling Gate where the patriot once fought. And as long as he lived was Plinganser honored and cherished as a brother by the noble Elector. Vide Baron Waldien's notes on Munich." Ernst smiled. "So far, so good," he said; "but, my erudite his- torian, you put me not off thus." "And may not one wander into a shop wheA the loquacious Backerin, naming no names, relates her family history, as is always done in novels.?

He was forced to bend low in order to catch her reply. "I thought you heart-weary, and not unreasonably, of my unforgiving temper." "O Margaret! could you doubt----" He stopped, the color mounting to his brow. Margaret's whole attention was engrossed by a chameleon-lizard which had changed to a granite gray as she pushed at him with the point of her parasol, where he lay ensconced in the crevice of the rock. Some dim, envious longing for the power thus to con- ceal her flushed face, passed through her mind as she stooped. But presently she raised herself, and was the first to break the silence. "What shall we do on this bright morning? Know that I hold you now my preux chevalier." "A ramble, a ride, a row, or a book. At your serv-, ice for any or all of these," he replied. "A book! 'Books in the running brooks' are the only ones most appropriate to this sunshine; What say you to a ramble right up this mountain-side? We can there peruse the running brooks at ourleisure, and I'm sure there are stones to deliver any number of sermons. Do you approve my selection?" "I do, indeed, and place myself entirely at your disposal. Shall we go now?" She nodded, and, springing from ledge to ledge, de- scended the parapet, staying at' the base to tie on the large straw hat which had fallen upon her shoul- ders. "If mamma were here," she said, her fingers busied   INGMTSCO.        315. with the ribbons, " she would scold me for wandering about hatles's in the sun, transformingi myself into a very ' nut-brown mayde.'" For a moment Ernst made no reply. Then he said abruptly: "You can never be happy, separated from her." "From whom? The nut-brown mayde? I do not think we shall be separated after to-day," Margaret laughed. "But, Ivar, hear me. From my own dear mother I am no more separated. You have reunited us, and we can not again be divided. Though during the coming winter I shall be in Switzerland, and she in Scotland, still, are we parted while together in thought and -in affection?. And when spring returns, will not you and I return with it to dear auld Scotland? Whither thou goest I will go-unless, indeed, you would have me leave you. That will I believe, if ever again you speak thus to me." * Her hand was in Ernst's while he assisted her up the rocks. He grasped it tighter for reply. They gained the summit of a cliff, and Margaret stopped to look back. Far below lay the castle, its massive towers dimin- ished in the distance, and lower yet the lake sparkled in the sunlight and leaped into white foam before the breezes sweeping over. She started as she surveyed-the onward ascent, and, in answer to Ernst, pointed to a wild pathway wind- ing farther up the mountain. "That,"'she said, "is the path I followed when I lost my way, and must have lost my life had it not been for you.  Do you remember?" Little need for that question, had she looked at him  &#xD;<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7551-00000159"/> 316        :IN[GTwrTaO. when she spoke. But absently she gazed,' in thought again pursuing the perilous path. "Margaret, it pains you to be here,"' Ernst said. "There are other ways up., I did not intend to lead you to this." She smiled sadly. "I would like to go there again. I have never been there since that day," she said. On then they clambered, until they reached once more together the brink of the ravine. Very different its aspect now from that in summer verdure. October frosts had indeed clothed in scar- let, gold, and purple many a tree and shrub and vine clinging to the stern gray precipices. But many also had turned pale and perished beneath the icy touch. And the fearful cliffs, the foaming torrent f -down the gorge, revealed themselves in all their terrors. Margatet shuddered and covered her eyes, clinging to Ernst's arm.             4 The cave, it was there, on the unseen face of that stupendous crag. She looked toward it eagerly, lift- ing her hand to shade off the sunbeams; and as she did so, that tiny thread-like line in her upraised wrist might be clearly traced. Ah l" she thought, "they are his--the cross and its power. I know that only too well. But-when we are one, where will the power be then?" Blushing at the thought, she touched the sign with her lips, blushing yet more as she glanced shyly up at Ernst. - He stood forgetful of her-she sighed. And yet the moment after he said: "If a month ago you had stood here, you had hard- ly thanked me for that life saved. Do you--- "   INGFEISCO.        817 " Ah dear Ivar!" she interrupted, "'let the dead past bury its dead.' Is the present a vacuum so utter that we must needs people it with these restless, un- happy ghosts?" "Can you forget the past?" he asked moodily. "All, .all," she hastened to reply, "if only we are -friends." He was thinking of the far away bright past, she but of the trial-time. And he was still there, when he spoke again. "You have said that we are friends. Do you re- member your old definition of friendship?" She bent her head,.replying: "Jeder Freund ist des andern Sonne und Sonnen- blume zugleich; er zieht und er folgt." "Can that be now between us?" he asked hesitat- ingly. "Now and ever."  "Could you trust, could you follow me now?" "As before," she answered, while her color deepened and her eyes sought the ground. And she saw not 'the kindling flash of his. She only heard the single word "thanks," coldly uttered, as it seemed to her. "Friends, only friends forever," she moaned to her, self.   &#xD;<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7551-00000160"/> XXVll. "DBAR as remembered kisses after death, And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feigned, On lips that are for others; deep as love, Deep as first love, and wild with all regret, O death in life, the days that are no more." THiE library was gloomy in the twilight. The fire, kindled rather for cheeriness than warmth, was dying out upon the hearth, and the embers threw but a flick- ering and uncertain light around, leaving the farther end of the apartment in total darkness. The rain beat in against the windows, the wind swept shrilly through the cloisters. Margaret, entering, was heart-chilled in the dismal atmosphere. She stood lorig upon the hearth, lost in thought, her head bowed, her hands loosely clasped: together. Then, sighing, sank upon the sofa. "Is it all over?  And is this 1F  endure forever? No end, no end?" she murmured. And drooping her brow on her hand, she sat watch; ing gloomily the sparks flashing out and disappearing one by one. Thus evanescent, thus sinking into deep- er gloom, she thought, are life's bright moments. A touch upon her shoulder. Still she did not move. ( My child," it was Ernst's voice then, " what is----" 4  ,       .1   INGEMSCO.        319 "Ay, you may well call me child," she interrupted bitterly. "It seems that to you I must always prove myself weak and childish." But as she met his sorrowful gaze she softened and said more gently: "Bear with me yet a little, Ivar. I will learn of you to be strong." "If you are unhappy  " "Hush, hush," she cried," it is the doleful evening-- the darkness. Ring for lights, and we will make it cheerful with music.

Ernst, the while resting his arm upon the mantel, looked down upon her with an expression to which he but seldom gave way, and never when she could meet it.  "See, Ivar," she said, touching the chords softly and low, and gazing dreamily into the glowing em- bers, "see in how short a moment the flame destroys a forest lord which half a century passed in perfecting. And all- to warm and cheer two idle mortals such as you and I. Might not a philosopher read therefrom a humiliating moral of the disproportion of cause and effect?"

"You say, then, with the poet: 'We live in deeds, not years; 'in thoughts, not breaths; In feelings, not in figures on a dial. We should count time by heart-throbs. He most lives Who thinks most, feels the noblest, acts the best.'" "Assuredly." "Then, Ivar," Margaret began, after a thoughtful silence, " then were you right to call me child, if in truth 'we live in deeds.' I have counted time only by the swift progress of the sun on the dial, or by the weary watches of the night. You, indeed, have lived. Was your trial-time of poverty long ago in Munich a weary while?   Is it possible for one to be 6ontent without the full measure of happiness?" "I once thought so. I was- learning then the hard lesson. False pride at the outset rendered it doubly difficult.". "And yet you are so free from false pride." "He must needs have been an unapt scholar who could have learned nothing from the lowly lives around me.

But the look was wist-   INGEMSCO.        821 ful, the laugh forced. Years later, however, it was different." "Why?" "Because then my star, if star I could have worn, would have shone to light myself alone. In that time of struggling if it had shone for me it would also have lightened the darkness for the few friends who were groping at my side. And in the darkness they had wandered from me." "The old bakeress, Ivar-Zozia-Ursin," Margaret eagerly exclaimed. "That was but repaying old debts." "Repaying indeed! But how late tea is!" and she crossed the room to ring the bell. "Why, who on earth is Ern-whose is this, dear Ivar?" she exclaimed presently, raising a port-folio from the table at which she had paused to arrange the books upon it. "Ernst Badarzewski? Myself," Ernst replied, ap- proaching. "OWhat, an assumed name?" "Did I not tell you? I knew none other until Zozia with my new fortune gave me also my new and right- ful name. But what is in a name?"' Her avoidance but now of that name had not es- caped him. But that moment he was like a man des- perately wounded with many wounds, who rather courts than wards off another. Another perhaps might deaden. She struck it home straightway. "Very much, Ivar."  He looked down upon her troubled face, where the lashes swept the cheeks, and interpreted aright.

He knew nothing of the fear dictating that reply, the fear lest he had discerned her secret, that Ernst was the true name, Ivar only the alias. "These are memorials of my artist-life. Do you care to look over them?" he asked abruptly. "I would like it so much."': And, curbing the impatient anguish at his heart, he drew forth sketch after sketch, ever ready to give account of that which interested her. "How  strange and how  beautiful! What does it mean? for I am sure it has a meaning," Marga- ret exclaimed, laying a detaining- hand upon one sketch. There an open sea, a weary waste of waters, darkled. Here, stretched the low, gaunt beach, while 'beyond, a magnificent mountain rose vailed in golden mists, rolling down from the summit all glorious in light, far brighter than the rising sun. But sea-fogs ob- scured the radiance, and twilight brooded on the waters, save where the pale moon struggled. And through the uprising mists might be traced, in an unbroken glory from the mountain-top, the light con- centrating in the moon and falling thence in broken rays upon the waves that, crowned here and there with foam, rolled onward to the shore. Ernst answered by reversing the picture. Margaret read:  Life is a deep and troubled sea, with waves on waves that roll Unstaying for each other still, impatient of control, That strive to speed, each one alone, in independent flight, 'Unwitting that in lnison lies all their glorious might-   rNGEMSCO.           323 Unwitting that the rolling sea, which seems to move so free, In the hollow of God's hand is held, through all eternity. Some waves glide languidly along, Unnoted 'mid the hurrying throng; Some dance along the ocean ways, All careless they, Time never stays. And some white crowns wear in the race, Yet leave upon the beach no trace. Yet move they not withouten light; Great hearts, like moons in heaven's height, Shine down upon the restless sea. Though waves the guiding influence flee, Though vailing mists rise angrily, Yet one great deed, one noble word, A lunar beam, the depths hath stirred. There are dark days when God's bright glance No more illumes the sea's expanse; When, cloud-concealed, the heavens frown On those rebellious waters down. Exultingly the wind sweeps by-- Some demon's fearful triumph-cry- When sink fair vessels, like lost hopes, And wave on wave in darkness gropes. But not for aye will He forsake, 'Tis only when they strive to break The bonds in mercy thrown around To bar them back from .death's pale ground. When they have crossed the wide, wide sea From Time unto Eternity, Let them approach, tAlil-worn and slow, And on the beach their tribute throw-- And then upon its pulseless breast, Till God awake them, let them rest.   .                       .  &#xD;<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC7551-00000163"/> "HABn! the raven flaps his wing In the briered dell below; Hark! the death-owl loud doth sing To the night-mares as they goe." "In Poland, Ivar?" Margaret asked as, equipped for riding, she entered the library. Ernst glanced at her wistful face, and laid aside his manuscript. "In Poland, but not beyond reach of your call. Whither away now, fair commandant?" "For a gallop over the hills and far away. But if I interrupt this evening, you must promise to allow me afterward to assist. May I not be your secretary? I should so like it." "Would you? Do you not fear I shall impose upon your generous offer?   No?  Then see what labor is in store for you." And he laid a roll of manuscript and quires of fresh paper in a desk apart. "There; my secretary ,tay begin her engagement when she chooses. But she must not labor over it, else I shall dismiss her." Margaret put on a rueful face, and bade him away to order the horses, while she practiced for her new vocation.   INGITISCO,        325 Accordingly, on Ernst's return he found her intent upon a sheet of paperditerally covered with names, titles of books, etc. She blushed and tossed the paper hastily aside, as he stood behind her chair and praised her clear, free handwriting. He remembered the blush when, one day long- after, stored among many another trivial thing her hand had touched, he found the paper, and in one corner beneath an attempted erasure, his own name-Ernst. It was a lovely, bright November afternoon, one of those autumnal days coming in the guise of spring, when we almost believe the bare branches stand ready to receive summer foliage instead of winter snow, and when the lingering leaves of gold and crimson seem more the rich promise of springtide than the pre- carious legacy of autumn. It was a day to make the heart beat joyously, the eyes brighten, the cheek glow with a deeper flush, touched by the cool, light breeze. Margaret's did so, and Ernst too caught the same spirit of gladness, for there were times when the mere being at her side was happiness sufficient. "Oh!" she cried, as they checked their horses upon the brow of a hill and together watched the going down of the sun behind the far western mountains, "is not this truly beautiful? Does it not recall many an Italian sunset--there is so much more of softness, of haze in the distance than is wont on Alpine heights. And the glorious autumnal coloring! Ah Ivar! is not autumn the season of seasons?" "( When one is happy--yes."

Very happy," and he grasped the hand. "Happier than before  " "No, Margaret," he answered shortly, dropping her hand and turning away. Tears of indignation sprang to Margaret's eyes. Tears of shame, too, as the old distrust, long slumber- ing, awoke. "Before," there was a past in which she had no part-a sealed sepulchre, the superscription of which she could only see, not read. In all their daily intercourse, in all that friendship dear, as he had called it, he had never mentioned Aimee's name. Pride had made it stranger to her lips, and pride now urged reply. "You misunderstand-  " she began. "Forgive me," he interrupted, "but the past, with its dead hopes, is a fearful thing between those whose hearts beat no longer together." Margaret's eyes fairly flashed. "He thinks to warn me thus," she thought. "He thinks to read my heart. He shall not." And she answered with well-assumed carelessness: "You say well. Remember the words of the poet: ' Am I, because the sweet past is no more, Dead as the leaves upon the graves of yore?' or upon the hills of yore, over which we must now fly, if we would not be belated." And off she bounded, giving Ostrolenka the reins. More silently and less gayly they proceeded home; ward, each feeling the burden of a secret and the ne- cessity for watchfulness. 't   IXNGSTMSCO.        327 "That is not the way we came, Margaret," Ernst- said, as she turned aside into another path. "I see it is not, now. But where does it lead? It is so' pretty." "A shorter path to the main road, but more peril- ous." "Is it really too dangerous? If not, let us follow, for night is falling now." "But see, the moon is rising through the trees. Are you afraid with me?" he asked. "Afraid! Oh! no." There was a hesitation which Ernst failed not to mark, of which she was unconscious, her thoughts longing for solitude and home, by the shorter way. Ernst, therefore, turned directly into it, confident of the sure-footedness of Ostrolenka, which he had made Margaret mount instead of the horse he was riding, a recent and not yet fully tried purchase for her. The way grew wilder and wilder until it became at length a mere bridle-path suspended midway down a precipice, of no very fearful height indeed, but yet dangerous enough to the timid or the careless of man or beast. The moon, through interlacing boughs, threw but a fitful and insecure guiding light upon it. "Ivar," called Margaret, who had ridden some paces ahead, " see, my bridle is loose. Will you arrange it for me?" He rode forward and soon set it to rights. As he again raised himself in his saddle, the moonlight fell upon his face, and Margaret was heart-struckl with its sadness. She thanked him gently, and added: "I am so sorry I chose this way. I had no idea it was so unsociable."  &#xD;<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC7551-00000165"/> 328        INGTMTSCOo He smiled. "That it will not be much longer," he replied. "Af- ter yonder angle two can ride abreast. I would give Ostrolenka the rein, she knows the path. Ride slowly, I am close behind," At that instant a large bird, startled, rose suddenly f om the tree beneath which Margaret staid, and, flap. ping its vast wings, fled with a shrill cry across the gorge. Ostrolenka did not blench. But a sound far more fearful to Margaret's ear followed upon that cry, and when she turned in quick affright, horse and rider were no longer there. The terrified animal had reared and would have plunged madly forward but that the iron grasp of Ernst forced him back upon his haunches, Only, how- ever, for another bound and another struggle but too unequal upon a mere foothold of rock. Margaret listened, dizzy and faint, to'the low plunge below, and gazed down with straining eyes upon the indistinguishable mass of light and shadow. But after a second, nerved by her agony, she sprang from her horse, and seeking carefully--carefully, for his sake- soon found a descent. When at last she had gained the bottom of the de- file, dread of what might be for a moment made her so weak that she was fain to sink upon the ground, pressing her face down on the cold, damp turf to shut out all possible sight. Only for one moment, how- ever. The next, she began her dreadful task, groping among rocks and bushes for-perchance a lifeless body. Long she sought, and at length, with a wild cry, flung herself upon her knees. Her search was over.     INGEMSCO.        829 There lay the mangled horse in the last death-strug- gle-here, her delicately clad foot thrust itself into a, pool of blood slowly dripping into a brook that gush. ed out from the base of the cliff. And here lay her husband. Was it his blood? She dared not think, but bending over, raised his head from the blood- stained turf, pillowing it upon her bosom. The moonbeams falling upon his face, showed it pallid as death itself, and when Margaret placed her hand upon his heart the pulsation was so slight that at first she thought all was over. But she attempted to lift his right arm, from which blood was flowing, and the livid lips parted in a groan. Thankful beyond measure for even this sign of suf- fering, she was able to collect her thoughts. She saw that he was faint from loss of blood, and dared not leave him thus, to seek assistance. And yet she trem- bled at the idea of again touching the painful wounded arm. - But she summoned all her courage, and finding a penknife in his breast-pocket, tore open the sleeve and bound up the wound as best she might with hand- kerchief and vail. Then dipping her hand in the stream that rippled beside, she washed away the clot- ted gore from a gash in the temple, which had already ceased to bleed, and bathed the ghastly brow, and tried to pour the ice-cold water between the parted lips. Buts each attempt was vain, and he lay motionless, hardly breathing. Then she knew she could do nothing more, and must leave him to bring aid more effectual. She spread upon the frosty ground a heavy shawl which she had with instinctive providence snatched from her saddle, laid his head gently down upon it and  &#xD;<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC7551-00000166"/> 330        INGETSCOo. wrapped it around him. Then pressing her lips once passionately to those so cold now, she went her way without another look. With the wind sped Ostrolenka, perils all unheeded by her reckless rider. Leaps were taken, heights were scaled at a gallops before which at another time Ostrolenka and her mistress would both have faltered. And now the night changed.  The wind blew cuttingly from the north, and from the gather- ing clouds through which the moon was struggling, wreaths of snow whirled blindingly into the face of the lonely traveler. She shivered with cold, deprived of the warm shawl with which she usually guarded against such sudden change, of not infrequent occur- rence in these mountains. But she only urged her horse the faster; blindly though it were, thinking ever of that dark defile and the lonely sufferer there. The highway gained, it was not long before cottage-lights made- themselves visible through the woods skirting the road&amp; As Margaret rode up, the goodman stood above in the doorway, at the head of the entrance-stairs, to see what wild thing that might be which dashed up in such mad haste. And the curly-pated - children peeped beneath his arm, pushing and scrambling under that protecting power, yet shrinking back too as they whispered together of the Erl-King dread, "with crown and train," who rides so late through night and wind, and all to whisper lying promises into any little one's ears which he can hold out there in' his cold fingers-father and mother hearing the while naught save the gusts rattling in the hard, dry, wintry-leaved boughs of the forest around.

"A fall?" the man asked, with the nonchalrance of habit. "Yes, yes. Down from the first path that branches off this road, toward Morgarten-the dark hollow, near the turn.

He hurried off, having, while receiving these direc- tions, been duly muffled up by his daughter and his wife, who now, thrusting aside and dismissing with a hasty cuff or two the children curiously pressing round, bade Margaret dismount and at least await the return of the father with assistance. "He is lying cold and alone. Let me go!" was the answer, as she strove to free her bridle.  &#xD;<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC7551-00000167"/> 332        INGROTTSCO. But the strong,'detaining hand prevented, and the poor, trembling, shivering girl was lifted from her saddle and carried, rather than led, into the cottage, where the kind souls seated her like a helpless child before the glowing hearth. And indeed a helpless child she was, until the kindly offices of the women restored warmth to her frozen limbs and to her frozen heart.' The stony gaze melted from her eyes, and she wept-at first wildly, afterward more calmly. "Lotte," said the good housewife, upon whose moth- erly bosom Margaret's weary head had hdrooped, to the young girl who knelt chafing her benumbed hands, "go thou and fetch some of the last year's wine. It will do her good now." Margaret raised herself as the girl put the flagon to her lips. "Let me take it to him," she said, pressing her hand. "Thanks to your great kindness, I am quite strong again, and I may not leave him longer alone." They gave a flask, and wrapped her in Warm cloaks, while she in simple heart-words thanked them. She was now so composed that when, as Lotte led up her horse, a chubby urchin, finger in mouth, pulled her dress from behind, looking up at her with great, round, wondering blue eyes, she turned, and lifting him in her arms gave him a kiss, which went straight to the mother's heart. Then she set forth again, despairing no more. When she checked her horse upon the well-remem- bered spot, such had been her speed that it was scarce an hour since she had- been there before.' She had grown strangely hopeful, and more than half expected to find Ernst conscious. *    INGEISCO.        333 She sprang down from crag to crag, and ere long reached the old maple where crimson-leaved branches, drooping to the earth, concealed the rivulet and him who lay beside. She listened with suspended breath, parting the boughs, but in sudden terror daring not to look. Not a sound broke the stillness of the night save the near babble of the rivulet and the reiterated hoot- - ing of an owl in the forest overhead upon the cliffs. Now the moon glanced through hurrying clouds-and again all was dark. But that one glance struck Mar- garet with dismay. Beside the brook he lay, rigid and deathke as before. In an instant she was at his side, had raised his head from- the hard ground, and sheltered him from the night-wind. She bent over him in agony. "Ernst, my own Ernst," she -cried, "speak to me, but one word-one word! O God I it is too late!" Did she see in the dim light a momentary quiver- ing of his eyelids as she murmured that name passion- ately again and again? Or was it but a shadow flick- ering athwart his brow from the tossing maple boughs? She fancied that he ,moved, and she tried to make him swallow the wine she had brought. But it was all in vain; and helpless she sat, while moments lagged like hours-dreary thoughts of the past, vain thoughts of what the future might have been, thronging on her. From time to time she roused, as upon the stillness of the night arose some sound louder than the rippling of the brook or the soughing of the wind through the dusky pines that, clustered upon cliffs and promontories on either side of the defile, shut out with gaunt, weirdc boughs the uncertain light of stormy skies. Hoping it  &#xD;<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC7551-00000168"/> 334    .    INGEISCO. the sound of coming rescue, she would raise her voice and shout until the dying echoes and the nearer crash of falling tree or rock, followed by deepening' quietude, -told her no human being wa's at hand. And when through drifting cloud and intercepting branches now and then the moon looked down, she gazed with' trem- bling earnestness upon the face upturned to hers, in terror lest that which was so like to death might be itself. She could not pray. All the hardness of those heavy months was pressing on her heart again. She crouched there with a murderer's conscience, crushed down, and staring in the face a dreader than a mur- derer's retribution. Sudden blasts twisted the naked boughs into sem- blance of shadowy forms, and the falling snow in gusts advanced or retreated-mist-clad wraiths of the wild wind's raising. And an ancient rhythm haunted her, moaning in that moaning wind, while aye and anon the neighboring owl repeated his doleful cry: "Hark I the raven flaps his wing In the briered -dell below; Hark I the death-owl loud doth sing To the night-mares as they goe." All has an end, however, and in the end. her cries were answered. Carefully the four strong men lifted Ernst upon the litter and bore him on to the awaiting carriage, where also awaited Dr. Berger. And. when Margaret, seated in the carriage, support- ing her husband, silently extended her hand to the Doctor, and besought with eloquent eyes the hope she   INGrEMSCO.        335 dared not ask in words, the kind old man replied with a grave smile and a nod:  , "Yes, yes, my dear young lady. Careful nursing, indeed, and good medical attendance---" So then it was no death-owl sang that night "in the briered dell below."  &#xD;<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC7551-00000169"/> "TIrF im Dunkel glanzt ein Licht." THE morning sun was streaming brightly into the library where Margaret sat at her writing-desk, upon which lay a freshy-copied manuscript to which she was putting the last finishing touches. Very lovely was she this morning. The sunlight touched into the splendor of red gold the waves of hair drooping low upon the shell-like ears and gathered in a simple knot behind. Her dress of silver-gray swept the floor in heavy folds, and contrasted well with the purity of her brow and the blush-rose on her cheek. Her lips were parted in an unconscious smile, and as from time to time she glanced up from her occupation, her eyes smiled as well. ,When the door opened behind her, she spoke with- out turning or pausing in her task: "Ursin, take up your master's chocolate, and ask him to send word when he is ready for me to read. I am afraid he will want to come down, but he must not on any account; Dr. Berger says he must not." She was startled by a hand upon her shoulder, and, turning, met Ernst's smile. . She started up, very grave. "O Ivar! you ought not!" she said reproachfully.   INGEMSCO.  i    .  337 "You know the Doctor said so. And your broken arm just getting so much better, too! You are the most unreasonable, impatient-  Why, who on earth arranged this sling?"' And she busied herself with its folds until he caught her hand in his left. She struggled to free it; her color deepening. "You are tring to propitiate your nurse, are you? Well, she must not scold any more, especially as you do really look so well. -But I shall tell the Doctor, most assuredly, and see if he does not give you up as an incorrigible, self-willed " "And do you imagine it is Dr. Berger who has saved my life?" he asked, still keeping possession of her hand and looking down into her blushing face. "Why, of course. Ursin and I certainly claim to be excellent nurses, but we did not set your broken arm nor mend your broken head." "No, you did far more. Whose voice, whose touch but yours, calmed me through the wildest delirium of fever? And "- sinking his voice-- "but for your gen- tle presence I had not cared to live." He dropped her hand and turned away. "Have you had your chocolate?"Margaret asked softly, putting away her writing-materials. "I really don't know-yes, certainly--are you going?" "Not if you want me." "Ay. I would ask you something, Margaret." "Well?2" He said nothing more, but continued his restless walk. Margaret resumed her seat, and again taking up the  &#xD;<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC7551-00000170"/> 338        INGRMTSCO. manuscript, occupied herself with it for some mo- ments. Then she rose, saying: "Well, my Lord Count, what think you of your secretary? Here is your manuscript complete." "What, has my nurse really been secretary too?" "Really." He drew a desk toward him and attempted to un- lock it, but unsuccessfully. "Will you open it for me and lay the manuscript within? I am not very expert with my left hand," he"said. "Oh!" she cried, raising the lid and letting it fall again, "is this the way you keep your papers? For shame!" '"I see your orderly little fingers are eager to put them to rights. Will you do it?" She smiled and began the task, he the while stand- ing behind her chair, not watching her, but gazing ab- sently upon the floor. "Those are letters from old student friends," he said, as she appealed to him, lifting a packet, " and that is my mother's, you remember. Lay them aside to read if you care to do so." Suddenly Margaret started as though she had been stung. A sealed letter dropped from a handful of papers, but before Ernst could see, she had pushed it from her, and now, with trembling fingers and pas- sion-blinded eyes, pored intent upon a blank folio. But Ernst could not fail to perceive her agitation. "What have you there, Margaret?" "Oh! nothing," she returned in icy tones, hurriedly addressing herself to her self-imposed task. "'Nothing? And does nothing change you thus in   INGMBISCO.        339 a moment?  Will you not tell me?  For clearly, something, fancied or real, has come between us. Will you not trust- me, Margaret?" She flushed and trembled, but lifted a steady gaze to his, while she drew forth the letter. He took it, glanced at the address, then earnestly at her, before he broke the seal, with a strange smile -a smile that baffled her. "Will you read?" he said, offering it. She drew back. "I am no spy upon your actions," she said hoarsely. ':I do not demand-I refuse-your tardy confidence. I scorn a right demanded." "Nevertheless, I demand my right of confidence," he interrupted, still with the same smile. "Read, Margaret." He unfolded the letter and held it for her, throwing his arm around her shoulders. "For months, my sister Aimee, I have hoped for, have anticipated this moment. I met and knew you at once, having kept trace of the change of name your marriage brought, and seeing in your face our moth- er's, too clearly for a moment's doubt. I sought you, watched and listened, now resolved to claim you, now repelled by your persistent turning away from the darkness of our childhood. I blame you not. Yours is a sunny nature, shrinking from the shadow of trouble, and God knows I would not have it fall on you. When it was upon me, I came not near you, lest it should. Ujpon your own words-I have striven to forget them, I can not--the world cares not for the hovel in the valley when it stands by  &#xD;<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC7551-00000171"/> 340        INGEMSCO. the palace on the mountain. Nor H-' was based at length my resolve of silence. That resolve should never have wavered, though it could not kill the brother's love, were I not going where you will hear of me no more. I go, and alone. My Margaret, mine no longer, I may meet never again. You love, are loved, are happy--I but love. Therefore by the sacred memory of our mother, I make of you one demand. She is your friend. Let her be your sister, and pay to her ever the debt of affection your conscience claims for         ERNST IVAR ZAJK, I KWSKI." Margaret sat motionless, without a word, but her changeful face had need of none. It was burning with blushes, and she would have stolen away, had it .not been for the dear constraint of that firm-clasping arm. How safe she was:within its shelter! And she had struggled from it all this while. How patient, how long-suffering his love! And yet she instinctively put up her hand to shield hers from his reading. In the midst of all her thoughts came Aimee. She remembered how she had one day remarlked that Count Falkenstein and Aimee were most unlike in appearance for brother and sister. And how Aimee had said quickly: "But then, you know, he is not really my brother." To Margaret's surprised inquiry, she had added that Max's mother was her godmamma, had brought her up, and-no, she did not know what her own name was, or that she had a relation in the world-and it was very unkind of Marguerite, who had so many, to make 'her think of-to make her think, Margaret had soothed her as she might a fiet- ted child, and the subject Was never again named.   INGEMSCO.        341 She strove to tell Ernst this, but speech would not come. So content was she under the shadow of his great love as at last she knew it, that she would not move lest it should vanish as a dream.. 4 But her downcast eyes rested upon a sheet of paper, upon the fair surface of which were inscribed only four words, in a wavering hand so like her own that her attention was attracted-," Mother, I am-dead." "What is this?" she asked, lifting it and turning to her husband. He grew very pale and took the paper from her. Then, as she looked up at him, surprised, he silently turned the reverse of the sheet. There was only a. date. She remembered that. And his meaning flashed upon her. She deliberately folded the paper, and tear- ing it across once and again, dropped the fragments upon the carpet. His arm drew her closer yet. "Margaret!" he said in a low and thrilling voice. The bowed head sank yet lower until it rested on his arm, and the quivering lips parted with one word-- (Ernst!"  &#xD;<pb n="342-343 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC7551-00000172"/> 7        .'
