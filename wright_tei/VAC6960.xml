               <p>SHE was a beautiful vessel for those days—the year 1812. Sharp forward and aft,
                  her masts not quite so raking as those of a clipper of modern times, but lofty and
                  tapering, made of the pliant but tough Norway pine, which like the spirit of a
                  proud, true man, will bend, but never break. Her tonnage might have been a few
                  tons over two hundred—not more. Her rigging was that of a brigantine, with very
                  long lower, topsail, topgallant and royal yards, and studding-sail cooms below and
                  aloft, made for and calculated to spread an enormous quantity of canvass for the
                  size of her hull. Her main boom ran out full twenty feet over her stern, giving
                  scope to stretch out her mainsail, while her gaff above, and long topmast were
                  rigged to spread a large flying-gaff-topsail. Every stay fore and aft, had its
                  stay sail bent, and she was ready to show all the canvass that could be set on a
                  craft of her rig and size.</p>
               <p>On deck, she was flush fore and aft—all the accommodations for officers and crew
                  being below. Her bulwarks were low—low enough for three pivot guns, long eighteens
                  to work over and clear of them. One of these guns was on the quarter-deck, just
                  forward of the wheel, the next amidships, between the main and foremast, and the
                  third forward, just abaft the windlass.</p>
               <p>Large arm chests, containing boarding-pikes, cutlasses and battle-axes, were
                  affixed to the bulwarks on either side of the quarter-deck, the chests for
                  fire-arms being below in dryer quarters.</p>
               <p>The vessel's hull was painted black, with a red ribbon just above her waterline,
                  giving her a light and airy appearance on the water, and her masts and yards were
                  all scraped and oiled, except at the heads and arms, which were painted black like
                  the hull. Her rigging was stout and perfect, her ground-tackle new and good, and
                  she appeared to be well found in every respect,</p>
               <p>She was as could be plainly seen, entirely new, her copper had never even been
                  tarnished by a change of water since she had been launched. On her round stern in
                  plain gilt letters was her name:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"CLOUD-RIFT, <hi rend="i"/>of Salem, Massachusetts."</p>
               </q>
               <p>As she lay in the dock, in the last named town, quite a crowd of persons were
                  gathered down to look at and admire her, and to congratulate her rich and
                  patriotic owner. Mr. James Everett, upon his success in building and safely
                  launching the prettiest vessel that had ever come off the stocks in Salem.</p>
               <p>The old gentleman, for a man bordering<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6960-00000003"/> ing
                  on sixty, was as lively and active, physically and mentally, as most men of forty,
                  and personally superintended his large business as an importer, shipper, and
                  wholesale merchant; doing more in his general line, than all the other merchants
                  in town. He was a widower, with two children. The eldest just turned twenty-one,
                  being a son, unfortunately for his father as well as for himself, wild, reckless,
                  and dissipated. The other child was a mild-tempered, loving, and beautiful
                  daughter, in her nineteenth year, at the date when this story opens.</p>
               <p>Robert Everett, the son, had no friends, except the dissolute companions with whom
                  he spent his money—but Nellie, the daughter, had not an enemy on earth. She had
                  many friends, and some who sought to be upon nearer terms than those of
                  friendship; for the only daughter of a man well up in the millions, was sure to
                  draw the attention of marriageable men, even if she had not been possessed of
                  great beauty, considerable talent, and a warm, true heart. But of all her suitors,
                  and there were many, no one could boast of having drawn from her a mark of
                  preference. They were all treated politely; but when it came to a proposal, none
                  were preferred to papa—she cooly said she had not thought of such a thing as
                  marriage, perhaps she never should. Her heart was free and so should be her
                  hand.</p>
               <p>But there was one young man who always visited her father's house when he came in
                  from sea, who never met or parted with her without receiving a warm pressure from
                  her soft hand; and there was ever a brighter color in her cheeks, and an extra
                  brilliance in her dark hazel eyes when he was present.</p>
               <p>This young man, Clarence Rhett, had been, from early boyhood, in the employment of
                  her father, and had worked his way along from an orphan boy of fifteen, before the
                  mast, to the first mate of the largest and best East India ship owned by Mr.
                  Everett. He had known no home but the house of Mr. Everett when ashore; for both
                  of his parents had died of the same disease, yellow fever, brought in by a Havana
                  trader, at the same time leaving them literally alone in the world.</p>
               <p>All the wages he earned after deducting what he needed for clothing and such
                  necessaries, he placed in the hands of Mr. Everett for investment. and his steady
                  attention to duty, his high moral principles, his skill as a seaman, as attested
                  by every Captain that he had ever sailed with, and his often proved bravery, had
                  made him a great favorite with the old merchant, who ever kept a close watch over
                  the persons in his employ, rewarding the meritorious, and discharging the needless
                  and unworthy.</p>
               <p>And now avast with this explanatory and necessary episode, and we shall go back to
                  our story.</p>
               <p>Mr. Everett was on the wharf, to which his brigantine had just been hauled in from
                  the yard where she had been rigged and fitted out, and his friends were crowding
                  around to look at his vessel, and speak their praise of her beauty and his
                  loyalty; for it was well known that he had built her to act as a privateer for the
                  protection of American commerce, and the destruction of British power and property
                  on the ocean.</p>
               <p>He received them and their praises in his usual cheerful way, answering their
                  questions, and listened to their suggestions as complacently as if he had not the
                  care of four or five millions of active dollars in his mind.</p>
               <p>But an unusually pleasant smile was on his face, as a tall, sun-burnt young man,
                  with nut-brown hair and blue eyes, dressed in nautical style approached him with a
                  look of respect.</p>
               <p>"You sent for me Mr. Everett!" said he.</p>
               <p>"Yes, <emph>Captain</emph> Rhett," replied the old merchant, extending his hand
                  and grasping that of the young man warmly.</p>
               <p>"!" <emph>Captain</emph>
                  <choice>
                     <sic>exclamed</sic>
                     <corr>exclaimed</corr>
                  </choice> the young man. "Though I have served you for nearly fifteen years, Mr.
                  Everett, I did not know I had ever received or deserved any higher title than that
                  of Mate of the good ship Hoogly."</p>
               <p>"You are <emph>Captain</emph> now, sir, and there is your craft. She is a beauty,
                  has been named by my Nellie, and you must take care of her. Come aboard with me,
                  and take a look at her, and tell me if there is a single thing wanting, below or
                  aloft."</p>
               <p>There was a loud cheer from the crowd on the wharf when they heard this
                  announcement, for young Rhett had many friends and few enemies</p>
               <p>He was so taken aback by the unexpected announcement of his promotion to the new
                  and splendid vessel, that he could not make a reply at first, but followed his
                  generous patron and friend on board, and down into the cabin, in silence</p>
               <p>He was astonished at the elegant manner in which the vessel was fitted up. Her
                  cabin looked more as if it had been intended for the yacht of some nobleman, than
                  for an American merchantman or privateer. The mouldings of the cabin were of white
                  and gold—the berths were curtained with silk and velvet, the chairs and settees
                  were solid mahogany, everything was elegant, massive and costly. But what pleased
                  Clarence Rhett most was that in the small after-cabin, always reserved by the
                  Captain for his own especial use, there hung the portraits in oil, faithfully
                  executed, of the merchant himself and his beautiful daughter.</p>
               <p>"As I built the craft, and Nellie named her, we concluded that our pictures ought
                  to go with her," said Mr. Everett, when he saw the eyes of the young Captain fall
                  admiringly upon the pictures, "you must never let a Johnny Bull get hold of
                  them."</p>
               <p>"They shall sink to the bottom of the ocean with me first, sir!" said Rhett,
                  warmly. "But, Mr. Everett, this matter takes me altogether by surprise. I heard,
                  when I came in the Hoogly the other day, that you had built a new vessel, but I
                  knew nothing of her rig, or what trade she was intended for. Have you considered,
                  sir, before offering me this splendid command, how young I am, and that you have
                  many older and more experienced men in your employment than I am?"</p>
               <p>"I have considered, Captain Clarence Rhett," said the old merchant,
                  good-humoredly, "that you brought in the Hoogly safe, after a long and stormy
                  voyage, with half her crew disabled, and her captain sick and unfit for duty
                  nearly all the time you were out. And I have also considered that when the Hoogly
                  was attacked by six Chinese piratical junks, you, with your undaunted courage,
                  beat them off, and, by your cool management of the ship, you ran down and sunk
                  four of them, thus saving for me a ship and cargo worth full five hundred thousand
                  dollars. And—hold on, sir, not a word till I have done—I have considered that you
                  have sailed for me over fifteen years, now, without ever having been complained of
                  by a single captain for neglect of duty, dishonesty, or immoral conduct—I am not
                  done yet, be patient, young man, and wait until I have said my say out. You have,
                  during that time, placed money in my hands, which, principle and interest, amounts
                  now to over fourteen thousand dollars, just half the cost of this vessel and her
                  outfit, this cabin furniture excepted, which is a present from Nellie. Now, sir,
                  you are Captain of the Cloud-rift, at any rate, and, if you choose, you are
                  half-owner. Your money will take just half of her. What do you say?"</p>
               <p>"That I accept your investment of my money gratefully, sir, and I will try to make
                  this vessel the most profitable craft you ever owned. I know, by her fitting out,
                  that you intend her as a privateer."</p>
               <p>"Yes, she has berths and arms for forty men. I want you to ship a young American
                  crew, for I believe, in war-time especially, with the great Washington, that we
                  should put none but Americans on guard."</p>
               <p>"I agree with you, sir, and I think I can soon pick up a brave and trusty crew.
                  You are going to lay the Hoogly up, and there are at least fifteen of her men,
                  true and tried, who will go with me anywhere."</p>
               <p>"That is excellent. They have seen you fight, and know what you are made of. And
                  now, my dear boy I have one unpleasant condition to make with your appointment. It
                  is, that you take my son, Robert, out with you, as first or second mate, I care
                  not which. He is so dissipated and so worthless on shore, that I must send him to
                  sea again, as I have done before, and all the hope I have of ever saving him, is
                  from your firmness and great moral example. Take him and<pb n="6-7"
                     xml:id="VAC6960-00000004"/> be as strict with him as you please; keep him and
                  your crew under the strongest kind of man-o'-war discipline, and he may yet turn
                  out to be something better than a spendthrift and sot."</p>
               <p>Mr. Everett," said Rhett, sadly, "Robert has always evinced a bitter hatred toward
                  me. You remember how he once slandered me, for the purpose of getting you to
                  discharge me."</p>
               <p>"Yes, my dear boy, I remember it, and how his falsehoods were disproved almost
                  before I had taken a second thought upon them. But try to forget and forgive that,
                  and, for my sake, see if you cannot make a man of him. Remember he is my son,
                  wicked as he is, and my only hope of him is that you can manage and reform
                  him."</p>
               <p>"Well, sir—I will try. Let him be rated at second mate, for I would like to have
                  Cromwell, the second mate of the Hoogly, as my first. He is brave, prudent; a
                  splendid seaman, and true man."</p>
               <p>"Then let him be first, by all means, and Robert second. You will find a new
                  sextant, quadrant, and chronometer, in your state-room, and a full set of charts.
                  Also a spy-glass and some tools to use when you get into action. The pistols once
                  belonged to my father and they are regular 'Joe Matons.' The sword is one which my
                  father took from a French Naval officer, in the time of the old French and Indian
                  war, for he was a Royal Volunteer in the great Canada expedition that went to help
                  Wolfe make a landing. And now, my dear boy, we will go ashore, for it is near my
                  dinner time, and I told my Nellie, this morning, that I should bring Captain
                  Clarence Rhett home to dine with me. So come along, for my dear child must not be
                  disappointed. She is my better angel, while Robert, in his wilfulness, throws a
                  continual shadow over my heart. But you will bring him around—I know you
                  will."</p>
               <p>And the old merchant led the way ashore.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <p>NELLIE EVERETT was her father's house-keeper. She had all the servants she
                  desired, but she kept the chief supervision of all the house-hold matters in her
                  own hands. The result was, that everything went as regular as clock-work
                  there—everything too, of household use, was as neat as a new pin. Tin, copper, and
                  brass ware shone like silver and gold. Her crockery had almost as pure an enamel
                  as her own <choice>
                     <sic>alablaster</sic>
                     <corr>alabaster</corr>
                  </choice>-like forehead. Her tablecloths and napkins were as white as her own fair
                  hands. In short, everything looked pure and wholesome.</p>
               <p>When the old merchant and Clarence Rhett arrived at ten minutes before the regular
                  dinner hour, Nellie was in the parlor ready to receive them; for a window from the
                  dining-room opened on the long, elm shaded street up which they came, and she had
                  seen them coming several minutes before they arrived.</p>
               <p>As usual, she greeted her fond old father with a kiss, a ceremony which doubtless
                  would have been quite agreeable to Clarence Rhett: but to him, she extended her
                  dainty little hand, and said, while a rosy smile lighted up her lovely face,—</p>
               <p>"I am very glad to see you, Mr. Rhett."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Captain</emph> Rhett, my dear child—CAPTAIN Rhett, of the American
                  Privateer Cloud-rift!" said the old gentleman, tapping his daughter playfully on
                  the cheek with his long, bony forefinger.</p>
               <p>"Then he has accepted the command," said Nellie. "I congratulate you, Captain
                  Rhett, and wish you success in everything you undertake, both afloat and
                  a-shore."</p>
               <p>"I could not refuse such a noble command," said Clarence, gravely, "Especially
                  since it has been honored with such especial care in its fitting out below as well
                  as aloft, and has such pleasant souvenirs for me to take care of. I am not a
                  boaster, Miss Nellie; but I shall try to prove worthy of the responsibility placed
                  upon me by your father's great kindness."</p>
               <p>"I know you will, Clarence—I mean Captain Rhett. I am so forgetful!" and a roseate
                  blush suffused the face of the beautiful girl.</p>
               <p>"I had rather be plain Clarence to you, Nellie," said he, in a low tone, "than to
                  be Captain before all the world."</p>
               <p>Nellie's father had gone into the hall at that moment, to put his hat and cane in
                  their accustomed place, so he did not hear that low-voiced remark, or see the
                  love-light which sparkled in two pairs of eyes.</p>
               <p>"I suppose dinner is ready, Nellie," said her father, returning to the parlor,
                  most probably in time to prevent a catastrophe; for if ever sweet lips pouted for
                  a kiss, then had Nellie's an instant before.</p>
               <p>"In just three minutes, father," said Nellie, looking at her watch—a good sized,
                  heavy gold time-piece, not one of those little Geneva bits of fashionable finery
                  of the present day.</p>
               <p>"Then by the time Clarence and I have paid a visit to the wash-room, it will be
                  ready," said the old merchant.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Captain</emph> Rhett!" cried Nellie, with a gay laugh. as she ran out of
                  the room.</p>
               <p>"I corrected her, and she is bound to keep me straight, I see!" said Mr. Everett,
                  with a laugh. "I suppose I need not invite you to the sideboard, Clarence, to find
                  an appetite in any of the old black bottles there."</p>
               <p>"No, sir," said Clarence. "I have never forgotten the advice you gave me when I
                  was a boy of fifteen, to let rum and tobacco alone. Neither of those articles have
                  ever yet passed my lips, and never shall. I have seen too much evil result from
                  the use of liquor, to even feel a desire for an artificial stimulant."</p>
               <p>"I am glad to hear you say so my young friend. If half my fortune would induce my
                  only son to be half as temperate as you are, I would sacrifice it without a
                  murmur. But come—we must not be a minute behindhand at the table, or there will be
                  a frown on Nellie's face.—She is like clock-work in her arrangements, and cannot
                  bear to have the soup cool a minute in the tureen."</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
               <p>IN a private room in the largest tavern in Salem, (<hi rend="i"/>hotels were not
                  known then,) four young men were seated at a card table. All were fashionably
                  dressed, and each wore that unmistakable look of dissipation, which, even at the
                  present day, is too often seen on faces which otherwise would be intelligent and
                  manly—we might say almost as handsome.</p>
               <p>Money—gold and silver, lying in various sized piles before the players proved that
                  gain, rather than amusement, was that for which they were seeking, with varied
                  success; for where one wins, another must as surely lose. They did not differ much
                  in age; the oldest not being over thirty, or the youngest under twenty-five
                  years.</p>
               <p>The youngest was Robert Everett: and he, too, had the hardest and most dissipated
                  look of them all.</p>
               <p>"And so, Bob, your old man wants to send you off to sea," said the oldest of the
                  party, and the son of a minister in town, whose grandfather had been distinguished
                  in former days for his zeal in persecuting witches.</p>
               <p>"Yes Bill," replied young Everett, "and I suppose I'll have to go, for he says
                  he'll cut off all supplies if I don't. As it is he is going to refuse to pay my
                  debts, I fear, and I shall be in a scrape if he does. Going to sea is all that
                  will keep me out of jail. It is not the mere going that annoys me, for I have been
                  on blue water, and rather like it; but he sends me out as a subordinate, when I
                  ought to go in command."</p>
               <p>"How so? And what do you think of going in?"</p>
               <p>"Why, in the new clipper brigantine that father launched last week. She is fitted
                  out complete for a privateering cruise, and she'll make her mark, too, if she is
                  handled well."</p>
               <p>"Who is to be her Captain?" asked Bascomb, or Bill," as young Everett called
                  him.</p>
               <p>"That is the thing I am almost ashamed to tell. The fellow was once a poor boy,
                  whom my father took into his<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6960-00000005"/> employ out of
                  charity. He has hung on with him for fifteen years, and came home in one of our
                  East India ships as <hi rend="i"/>mate, the other day. Now father puts this
                  upstart over me, and makes one of his cronies first mate, leaving me only as
                  second. It is too bad—too bad! I'd kick against it, if I was out of debt, and a
                  few hundreds ahead. It is too bad to have to serve under a fellow that was a
                  beggar but a few years ago, and who now puts on as many airs as he could if he was
                  a bred and born gentleman."</p>
               <p>"What kind of a sailor is he?" asked the card-partner of young Everett, a young
                  man named Ottis, who was spending the income of a fond mother, who had only been a
                  widow for a couple of years.</p>
               <p>"Oh, he is good enough there, for he has been brought up to it—has had his hands
                  in slush and tar since he was fifteen years old. He couldn't get to be first mate
                  of an East Indiaman without he was a good seaman, and a first rate navigator."</p>
               <p>"Will he fight?" asked Ben Brattle, the partner of Bascomb in the game.</p>
               <p>"Yes, he has the name of it with those he has sailed with. I don't know much about
                  him. I always despised and hated him, and I always shall. He is a perfect
                  milk-sop, never touches liquor, never smokes a pipe, never swears. I have tried my
                  best to get the old man down on him but never could succeed. They make more of him
                  at our house than they do of me, but it will not be so always. When my old man
                  kicks the bucket and goes to that better world that your old governer, Bascomb, is
                  so fond of talking about, I'll make him <emph>walk</emph>! You can swear to
                  that."</p>
               <p>"He might be made to walk before that!" said young Ottis, who was noted for his,
                  reckless dare-devil character. "You're a good shot, Bob, When you get off on this
                  cruise, why don't you force a quarrel on him, and get <emph>me</emph> for a
                  second, I'd bet it would be his first and last duel."</p>
               <p>"He will not quarrel with me. I tried that before he went on his last
                     <unclear>voyage</unclear>," said Everett.</p>
               <p>"Slap him in the face," said Bascomb, with laugh. "That would be apt to
                     <emph>rile</emph> him!"</p>
               <p>"I tried that very thing!" said Everett, "and the infernal rascal
                     <emph>laughed,</emph> as he knocked my down. I went and told my father, and he
                  said he had but one fault to find with him, and that was, that he did not
                  horsewhip me within an inch of my life.'</p>
               <p>"What is his name?" asked Brattle.</p>
               <p>"Clarence Rhett!" replied Everett. "His father was once a merchant, but had bad
                  luck and broke down just before he died. I believe he and my father were old
                  friends, but that is no reason why he should pick up his beggarly son out of the
                  gutter and put him over me."</p>
               <p>"That's so," said Otis. "Are you not going to play any more to-night, Bob?"</p>
               <p>"No—luck is against me in everything, I've lost on every hand."</p>
               <p>"There's nothing like fighting luck! It is bound to change some time or other,"
                  said Bascomb, glancing complacently at his own large winnings, for 'luck' had been
                  with him, at least.</p>
               <p>"Well, I shall not fight it any more now, at any rate,,' said Everett, "I've got a
                  plan in my mind, which I mean to go to work on."</p>
               <p>"Is it a secret," asked Otis.</p>
               <p>"No—not to you, boys. But I don't want it to get to the ears of Rhett. There is a
                  crew to be shipped for the brigantine right away, as soon as possible, and I am to
                  help to get men for her. Now, my plan is, to get as many fellows on board as I
                  can, who know and like me, and whom I can influence. Then, if anything turns up
                  while were on a cruise, by which I can get him into a scrape, or get him out of
                  the way, I'll have the brig, and a good part of the crew all right."</p>
               <p>"Good! I see through that. I've a confounded notion to go with you," said
                  Otis.</p>
               <p>"And I too," added Brattle.</p>
               <p>"Do it, boys—do it, and your example will bring in every one of our set in town,
                  and we can muster full thirty, all told, if not more."</p>
               <p>"That's so!" said Bascomb, "and I'll try a cruise, at any rate. If we don't make
                  this Mr. Clarence Rhett see stars before his first cruise be out, it will be
                  because the devil won't help his own."</p>
               <p>"Then I'm contented to go to sea in the Cloud-rift!" cried Everett, "for, with my
                  own set on board, Clarence Rhett will not be my master a great while."</p>
               <p>"That's so; and now I move that every one of us go to recruiting, being careful
                  not to get a man who will not work for and with us up to the very handle!" cried
                  Brattle.</p>
               <p>"Agreed!" said Otis, "I'm good for a half dozen recruits, at least. Some of them
                  will be rough customers, but they will go to old Nick for me as long as I lead the
                  way."</p>
               <p>"I can count up a dozen, but none of them are members of my old man's church!"
                  said Bascomb, with a laugh.</p>
               <p>"Well go ahead, boys, but be careful that Rhett don't smell out our game, or he'll
                  put a stopper on it. I shall pretend to be very friendly to him, now, and to be
                  brimful of patriotism; while, if the truth were known, I don't care a cent whether
                  England whips us in this war, or whether we whip her. One of these days, I'll be
                  rich at any rate, and you may bet your largest pile that I'll make money fly then.
                  The old man stares, now, when I run through with forty or fifty dollars in a day;
                  but, when his eyes are shut, I'll go hundreds where tens have to do me now."</p>
               <p>"Bravo? I like spirit, and Bob Everett is the man that has no lack of it!" cried
                  Otis, pocketing his money, for the others were taking up their stakes.</p>
               <p>"That's so!" said Bascomb. "And now, boys, it is all understood, isn't it? We're
                  to ship, and get as many more of our set to go as we can."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Brattle. "Where do we sign articles?"</p>
               <p>"Oh board," said young Everett. "I heard Rhett say that he would hoist his
                  recruiting flag to-morrow morning, and go to sea the moment he had a crew; for
                  everything is ready aboard the vessel for a cruise—guns, powder and shot all
                  aboard, and her stores ready to go into her hold the hour they are wanted."</p>
               <p>"We'll have to watch chances to run out. The English have got men-of-war all along
                  our coast," said Bascomb.</p>
               <p>"Yes; but if that brig gets a gun-shot distance outside, the fastest vessel in the
                  English navy will never catch her," said Everett. "She carries canvass enough for
                  three times her tonnage, and she is as sharp as a wedge forward and aft,"</p>
               <p>"Yes—I saw her on the stocks, but little did I dream I'd ever sail in her, or any
                  other craft," said Otis. Mother will kick up a devil of a fuss about my going, and
                  shed a bucketful of tears; but that is all the good it will do, for when I make up
                  my mind to a thing, the old woman knows I'll do it, if it costs me a broken
                  neck."</p>
               <p>The young men now rose up and left the room, their understanding as to the future
                  being complete.</p>

               <p>DINNERS in 1812 were not so ceremonious in the United States of America, as they
                  are in 1866; nor was it considered necessary, even in a mansion so decidedly
                  aristocratic as that of Mr. Everett's, the millionaire, to have a dozen different
                  courses, with a change of wine to each course, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">a la
                     Delmonico</foreign> of the present era.</p>
               <p>Mr. Everett invariably took three glasses of old port wine during dinner, and he
                  always had choice wines at hand for the use of his guests, who chose to partake of
                  them; but he had too much sense and true politeness, to press wine upon any one
                  who did not wish it.</p>
               <p>His family dinners did not occupy a great deal of time, and within less than an
                  hour from the time that he and Clarence Rhett joined Nellie at the table, they
                  were all three again in the parlor.</p>
               <p>"Take a holiday to yourself to-day, Clarence," said Mr. Everett, "and tomorrow
                  commence getting your crew for the brig. Nellie here wants to hear all about your
                  adventures with those Chinese pirates, and you can spin the yarn to<pb n="10-11"

                  a lazy habit, but I got into it when I went down to Cuba to spend a winter, and
                  can't break it off."</p>
               <p>And the worthy old merchant went to take his <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                     >siesta</foreign>, leaving Nellie to entertain Clarence Rhett.</p>
               <p>However much Robert Everett despised the young seaman for what he considered his
                  low origin, there was no such feeling in the breast of his fair and gentle sister.
                  She had known Clarence since her earliest childhood. As a boy, he had ever been
                  kind to her when a little girl, and never had come home from a voyage, without
                  bringing her some little token of his remembrance of her while abroad. For this
                  she had learned to love <choice>
                     <sic>hlm</sic>
                     <corr>him</corr>
                  </choice>, while yet a child, for her own brother never treated her with
                  affection; and her love grew with her own growth, almost without her knowledge,
                  until, arriving at the verge of womanhood, she began to blush and tremble as she
                  felt how much stronger it was than mere friendship. She tried to conceal her
                  feelings from him, and from everyone else; but the beating of her own heart,
                  whenever he came into her presence, told her but too well how much that heart
                  throbbed for him.</p>
               <p>That he loved her, he did not doubt, though he never had made a direct avowal: for
                  Clarence Rhett knew that he was yet comparatively a poor man, and he was too proud
                  and too sensitive, to aspire to her hand while he yet felt himself dependent upon
                  her father's kindness. Yet eyes answering eyes, had often told the tale of love,
                  by the lips yet unspoken.</p>
               <p>Nellie was coquettish in her ways, but she never had tampered with his honest
                  feelings, and he respected her the more for it. When. Mr. Everett went to his
                  chamber to take his usual <foreign xml:lang="SPA">siesta</foreign>, without any
                  prudishness, she took a seat by Clarence on the large, old-fashioned sofa, and
                  said:</p>
               <p>'Now, Captain Rhett, I am ready to hear of the desperate encounter which you had
                  with the pirates."</p>
               <p>"Not very desperate," said he, quietly. "These Chinese are cowardly wretches, and
                  it is not a matter of wonder that a few determined men could beat off a couple of <choice>
                     <sic>hnndred</sic>
                     <corr>hundred</corr>
                  </choice> of them, especially as we had superior arms, and a ship which we could
                  handle as we pleased while we had a working breeze. Their miserable junks are good
                  for nothing except when running off before the wind."</p>
               <p>"You will have a different class to encounter now," said Nellie; and she sighed as
                  she thought of the peril to which Clarence Rhett would be subjected when he went
                  to sea in the brigantine.</p>
               <p>"Yes—the English proudly boast that they rule the waves," said Clarence. with a
                  smile. "But right is superior to might, and our cause is too just for its
                  defenders to be doubtful over it; and so far as the Cloud rift is concerned, if
                  she does not greatly belie her looks, I need never run any risk of being over
                  matched in fight. I think she can outsail anything afloat, and when it will be
                  imprudent to fight, I can run away,"</p>
               <p>"Yes, if you will!" said Nellie. "I only fear that you will be too anxious to
                  serve your country, and to sustain the honor of your flag, to pause and consider
                  what the odds may be that appear against you."</p>
               <p>"I will pause, Nellie, I promise you; for the trust which your father reposes in
                  me is very great, and I must and will be prudent. In fact, my selfishness will
                  demand that, for your father has permitted me, with the savings of years, to
                  become half owner of the brig, and if I am only fortunate in taking prizes of
                  value, I may yet be rich enough to—'</p>
               <p>Here Clarence Rhett paused, and blushed like a young school girl caught kissing
                  her sweetheart.</p>
               <p>"Rich enough to what, Clarence?" asked Nellie, a rich smile brightening her own
                  sweet face, as she spoke. "Tell me, for I want to know what makes you, a man,
                  blush like a woman.</p>
               <p>"Rich enough to tell the only woman on earth that could win my heart that I love
                  her, and want her to become my wife!" said Clarence, blushing, and trembling, too,
                  at his own temerity.</p>
               <p>"What! Captain Rhett in love! And waiting to get rich till he declares his
                  passion? That is romantic, indeed. And yet, how singular. I thought love was
                  blind, and had no eyes for gold and jewels!" cried Nellie, in a bantering tone.
                  "Do I know the happy being who has been so fortunate as to fix the fickle heart of
                  a sailor?"</p>
               <p>"If you do not know her, no one else does," said Clarence, with a sigh,</p>
               <p>"Then I may be asked to act as brides-maid, when the happy day arrives," said
                  Nellie still speaking in a bantering tone. "I shall pray for your success in
                  making a fortune as rapidly as possible. But you have not told me the name of the
                  lady. Pray let me keep that secret for you. I will only tell Nettie Hambone and
                  Lizzie Schmidt of it, and then it never will go farther than all over town."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Nellie, what a tease you are."</p>
               <p>"Do you think so, Clarence? Well, just tell me the name of your lady love, and I
                  will keep it a secret from all but her."</p>
               <p>"Not till I can feel independent, kind Nellie. I can love, and let love feed upon
                  hope, as it has for years past," replied Clarence "I thought you wanted to hear
                  about those Chinese pirates."</p>
               <p>"So I did, until you touched a subject of far greater interest." said Nellie.</p>
               <p>"What is there in my future fate that can interest you, Nellie?" asked young
                  Rhett, gravely.</p>
               <p>"Clarence."</p>
               <p>'She only uttered his name, but her tone, and her look as it left her lips, spoke
                  a volume of reproach to him.</p>
               <p>The next instant she burst into tears.</p>
               <p>"Nellie, dear, dear Nellie!" he cried. "I did not mean to wound your feelings.
                  Rich or poor I cannot keep it longer. I love you better than life, a thousand
                  fold. For long years, you, and you only, have filled my heart. To be worthy you
                  and your love has been my only study—to win you at last, my fondest hope."</p>
               <p>"And yet you ask me what can be my interest in your fate?" she sobbed. "Oh,
                  Clarence I dare not trust my lips to say what my heart feels. I shall not pray for
                  you to bee me rich in the perilous life you are now to lead, but I shall pray, oh,
                  how fervently, that God may bring you back safe to me. I care not if it is
                  unmaidenly—you shall know that wherever you go, you carry the heart of Nellie
                  Everett with you. I never have loved, and never can love another.</p>
               <p>Tears of joy, such tears as were no disgrace to his manhood, gushed from the eyes
                  of Clarence Rhett when he heard this avowal: and he pressed the yet sobbing girl
                  to his breast, while he imprinted the first kiss of affection upon her spotless
                  brow.</p>
               <p>Forgotten, in the bliss of that moment, was all the distinctions of rank and
                  wealth. Their young hearts knew no thought but that the fountain of love was
                  opened to flow on while the current of life remained unfrozen.</p>
               <p>And thus for the time, in a dream too sweet to be broken, let us leave them.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
               <p>FOR three days only had the starry flag of the American Union been flying at the
                  mast-head of the peerless Cloud-rift, and yet in that brief time had Clarence
                  Rhett secured a full crew of sixty men; all that he could accommodate comfortably
                  on board, and all that were required to man, work and fight her. It seemed as if
                  all the young men in Salem were wild for a chance to go to sea in such a splendid
                  craft.</p>
               <p>Some of the men were very young, others wild and reckless in character; but Rhett
                  had about twenty old and tried sailors, whom he had known for years, and with
                  these, and a strict discipline, he calculated upon making all of his crew
                  serviceable. His first officer he knew to be a sterling man, upon whom he could
                  place entire dependence; and young Everett seemed to have turned over a new leaf
                  in the book of life, since his appointment to the privateer. He had not only shown
                  great zeal in recruiting men for the vessel, but had entirely abstained from the
                  dissipation which had hitherto made his career so disgraceful.</p>
               <p>So pleased was his father with these marks of reformation, that he paid all of his
                  debts, and also promised that if he<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6960-00000007"/>
                  continued to act as well, after a cruise or two in the Cloud-rift, he would build
                  a twin vessel to her, and give him the command.</p>
               <p>Robert Everett could play the hypocrite well. He schooled himself to an apparent
                  forgetfulness of all his former hatred of Clarence Rhett, and treated the latter
                  with an appearance of deference and respect, which completely blinded the
                  warm-hearted and open-natured young Captain to his real designs. He thought that
                  his reformation was genuine—his zeal and patriotism real, and that he was
                  determined to make his present and future atone for his past misconduct. He so
                  expressed himself to Mr. Everett and to Nellie.</p>
               <p>The former was delighted, but the latter knew too well the selfish nature, and the
                  serpent-like cunning of her brother, and she cautioned her lover not to trust him
                  too far. She hoped, she said, that his reformation might be lasting, but it was
                  too sudden to convince her of its reality. It was like camp-meeting conversions to
                  religion, gotten up by excitement, and sure, in nine cases out of ten, to result
                  in back-sliding.</p>
               <p>Urged by Nellie to be cautious, Clarence promised to keep a watchful eye upon
                  every action of Robert's, and upon his former associates, so many of whom had
                  shipped on board of the schooner.</p>
               <p>While the crew were being enlisted, Mr. Everett was engaged in putting on board of
                  the vessel all the provisions and stores which she could carry, and every kind of
                  munition then known in warfare, which could be made useful in service. He did not
                  pause for an instant to consider expense; he only wished to have the Cloud-rift go
                  to sea, as perfectly fitted out as means, liberality, and skill could make
                  her.</p>
               <p>On the fourth day from that on which he assumed command, Clarence Rhett announced
                  to the old merchant his entire readiness for a cruise.</p>
               <p>In some way, the English had apparently found out that a vessel was getting ready
                  for a cruise; for during the last two days, three of their men-of-war, two
                  frigates and a schooner, had closely blockaded the harbor, laying off-and-on as
                  close to the powerful shore batteries of the town, as they could without receiving
                  damage.</p>
               <p>"How will you get out with the brig?" asked Mr. Everett, when he and Clarence
                  stood on the headland at the mouth of the harbor, and scanned the motions of the
                  British cruisers outside.</p>
               <p>"I must wait for a dark night and a fresh nor'-wester," said Clarence. "It would
                  be folly to risk losing the brig in running that gauntlet without the advantages I
                  have named. But give me darkness and the right wind, and I can dodge them, and I
                  care not if they do see me. I know that I can show them my heels, if it is
                  necessary. If I only had the schooner to deal with, I would give her all she asked
                  for at close quarters, for I think, whatever faults they may have, that I have a
                  crew who will fight, and fight well, too."</p>
               <p>"I think there is no doubt of that," said Mr. Everett. "And we have only now to
                  wait for the wind to suit, and a cloudy night, for you to get them where their
                  courage can soon be proved."</p>
               <p>"I think, from the weather signs, I shall not have long to wait," said Clarence.
                  "It is wonderfully clear away to the northward and westward, and cool, too, for
                  the season. If the wind chops around from the south-east, where it has hung for a
                  week now, we will have it out fresh from the north-west, I am thinking. What do
                  you say, Mr. Cromwell? You are better than a barometer, generally.</p>
               <p>The last question was addressed by the young captain to the first mate, who had
                  come down with him, at his request, to take a near look at the cruizers outside.
                  The mate was in the full prime of life, apparently about forty years of age, a
                  tall, raw-boned muscular man, with a frame that looked as if he had been
                  especially built to meet and endure hard knocks.</p>
               <p>His clear, blue eye, well-bronzed face, and sharp features were all
                  "down-easterly," and indicative of the well-known character of the descendants
                  from <choice>
                     <sic>onr</sic>
                     <corr>our</corr>
                  </choice> Puritan forefathers, who have made New England, bleak and sterile as she
                  is naturally, rich and fruitful beyond parallel.</p>
               <p>"We're goin' to have a <choice>
                     <sic>bntt-ender</sic>
                     <corr>butt-ender</corr>
                  </choice> from the nor'-west, Cap'n, before two more suns rise and go down," said
                  the mate, in a positive tone; "and, when it comes, them Britishers will be smarter
                  than I think they are, if they can hug the mouth of this 'ere harbor. And I
                  calc'late we can go out easy.'</p>
               <p>"I'm glad to hear you say so, for I felt sure that the weather signs were good for
                  us," said Clarence. And now I reckon we may as well go back, for I want to
                  exercise the crew at the guns an hour at least, and in making and taking in sail,
                  as much more time, this afternoon"</p>
               <p>"Don't tire them out with too much exercise at first," said Mr. Everett.—"You may
                  dishearten them before you get them where you'll need them most."</p>
               <p>"To learn them their duty now, is only to fit them for work when it is really
                  needed," said Clarence. "They must know how to work the brig's battery before I
                  have to use it, and to make and take in sail in a hurry. They will not tire easily
                  of such exercise, when they consider how necessary it is that they should be
                  competent for duty."</p>
               <p>"That's so—the more they work now, the less they'll have to do by-and-by,' said
                  the mate. "That's what I tell 'em."</p>
               <p>"And they will soon see the benefit of it," said Clarence, as they started back
                  towards the brig.</p>
               <p>"What do you suppose has brought such a fleet so suddenly before our harbor?"
                  asked Mr. Everett, addressing young Rhett.</p>
               <p>"Some traitor in town has undoubtedly managed to send information out to the
                  English fleet, that a privateer is nearly ready for sea. There are tories
                     <emph>now</emph>, I expect, even as there were in the time of the
                  Revolution."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir—and I've been thinkin' since I saw how close they've been layin' in,
                  where they could see us so well through their glasses, that they might try an old
                  trick on us—come in at night with their boats, and try to cut us off or burn us,"
                  said the mate, in a serious, thoughtful way.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Cromwell—that is well thought of," said Clarence. "To-night we must have
                  every man on board from sunset on, and a full watch, armed, kept on deck.—Either
                  you, or I, will keep with the watch."</p>
               <p>"That's the way we always did, when I was with old Admiral Clayton, in the Peru
                  service," said Cromwell.</p>
               <p>"Then you've seen war 'service in the regular navy? I never heard you speak of it
                  before," said Clarence.</p>
               <p>"No, sir, I never say much about it," said the mate. "It wasn't <emph>much</emph>
                  fightin' them cussed Spaniards. But they were amazin' sneakin' in their ways, and
                  we had to be always on the lock out in the dark for them; it was they'd catch us
                  foul, if they could."</p>
               <p>"What are you thinking of Mr. Everett?" asked Clarence, noticing that his patron
                  seemed to be in a deep study over something.</p>
               <p>"I was wondering who it could be among us, that could have informed the English of
                  our matters here, and so put them on such a close watch over us.—Since the
                  fishing-smack "Two Brothers" was captured, none of our fishermen have gone out.
                  Our pilots all stay ashore—you know you had to pilot the Hoogly in yourself. There
                  is but one person who ever runs beyond the light on the point, and that is
                     "<emph>Half witted Joe,</emph>" who'd go out in his periagua to fish, if he
                  knew he'd meet old Satan on the banks. But he never would think of giving
                  information, even if he had the sense to do it. Poor Joe Bennett is as harmless as
                  a deaf cat."</p>
               <p>"Isn't he English by birth?" asked Cromwell.</p>
               <p>"Yes, but he has been in this country since he was a boy. I asked him once who his
                  father was, and he said King George. He is too idiotic to ever do any harm, or
                  much good, even to himself, in this world."</p>
               <p>"He is smart enough to be a pretty good pilot," said Clarence. "I remember some
                  ten years ago, when we were in the Jamaica trade, in the brig Eliza<pb n="14-15"
                     xml:id="VAC6960-00000008"/> Brown, we came too off the harbor one morning just
                  at daylight, and waited for a pilot. It looked blowy away to the nor-west, and the
                  captain was in a hurry to get in, before he lost the fair wind we yet had. Joe
                  Bennett came alongside in his fishing boat, and we asked him where all the pilots
                  were. He said they had been to a dance all night, and they would'nt wake up that
                  day, he reckoned. But he could pilot the brig in, and would, for a gallon of
                  cider.</p>
               <p>"The captain asked him about our compass bearings then, and the soundings, and the
                  course in, and he answered as sensibly as any regular pilot could have done. We
                  waited awhile, but our fair wind began to grow slack, and the clouds were rising
                  fast away in the nor-west, and the captain ran the risk, and let Joe pilot us in.
                  He did it as well as any pilot could, and though we kept a leadsman on each side,
                  throwing the lead every five minutes, he would tell us the soundings before they
                  sung out. They may call him 'half-witted Joe,' but, I believe, he has more wit in
                  some things, than those who sneer at him as a fool."</p>
               <p>"He may be the man, and I will have a watch on his motions hereafter," said Mr.
                  Everett. "We cannot be too careful who we have among us, when a powerful and
                  malicious foe is off our coast."</p>
               <p>"That is so," said Clarence. "But let me once get outside, and I'll draw them off,
                  if bold and daring work can do it, The Cloud-rift shall win a name."</p>
               <p>"Do not lose her by imprudence, or yourself either," said Mr. Everett! "It will be
                  more profitable and less dangerous, if you give their men-of-war a wide berth, and
                  look sharp after their merchantmen."</p>
               <p>"True, sir, but not quite so honorable," said Clarence, with a smile. "But I shall
                  not look especially after their men-of-war, but if one comes butt against me, she
                  may find me a hard nut to crack, if my crew are as staunch as my hopes make me
                  believe."</p>
               <p>"Well, use your own judgment, my boy. Here we are close to the pretty craft. I'll
                  go home to tea. Come up and breakfast with me in the morning."</p>
               <p>"I will, sir, if nothing happens in the shape of duty to prevent it."</p>
               <p>And while Mr. Everett went on up the street, Clarence Rhett and his trusty first
                  mate went on board the brig.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
               <p>It would have been well for Mr. Everett, and others also in Salem, if they had
                  sooner felt suspicious of treason in their midst, and kept a watch upon the
                  singular being who was spoken of in our last chapter as "Half-witted Joe."</p>
               <p>For at the very time when Mr. Everett was speaking of him, he was on board of the
                  English Frigate Shannon, which, commanded by Captain Brooks, lay the outermost of
                  the British blockading vessels; and was giving for an idiot, as he was supposed to
                  be, a very lucid account of the state of affairs in Salem and Boston, which latter
                  place he had visited a day or two before.</p>
               <p>He looked like an idiot at a first glance, for his large grey eyes were cold and
                  lustreless—his sharp, thin face was pale and of a yellowish cast, not
                  extraordinarily clean, either. His thin, scattering beard was snarled and dirty,
                  and so was the matted, yellowish hair on his head. His garments were old and
                  ragged, and he looked altogether like one of those wandering vagabonds, whom you
                  may often meet, hat in hand, soliciting charity in or about large cities.</p>
               <p>"When will this frigate, that you talk about, be ready for sea?" asked Captain
                  Brooks of Joe Bennett as he stood before him in his cabin.</p>
               <p>"The frigate is ready now," replied Joe, but her crew arn't. They want pay and
                  prize money to go on a spree with, and they can't get it. I heard some of 'em
                  growlin' about it when I was down to Boston, in a bar-room in Congress
                  Street."</p>
               <p>"Who is her Captain? Did you hear his name?" asked the English Officer.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Sir, he is a new man to the ship and the crew too. His name is
                  Lawrence."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Lawrence</emph>?" said Captain Brook, thoughtfully. "Not him who had the
                  Hornet, and sunk his Majesty's sloop-of-war Peacock?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Sir; he's the man. I heard the Yankees braggin' about that very thing."</p>
               <p>"Then, when his frigate comes out, they, or I, will have something more to brag
                  about," said Captain Brook. "He is a brave enemy, and one there will be credit in
                  meeting, and honor in defeating. If you can find out when he will come to sea, my
                  man, I will double—yes, treble the number of golden guineas you have now in your
                  pocket. Will you do it?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir. Old Joe don't know much, the Yankees thinks, but he knows enough to
                  love the chink of gold,"</p>
               <p>"Well my man, be faithful to me, and you shall have plenty of it. And now about
                  this privateer brig. She will never come out while we lay here at the mouth of the
                  harbor, that is a sure thing. And if we go away and let her get out, if she is as
                  fast as you think she will be, none of us can catch her, and she will do immense
                  damage before her career is checked. Could you pilot boats up to the privateer
                  past the batteries?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, in a dark night, if they made no noise. But they keep a close watch
                  down at the batteries, and the channel runs close under the guns."</p>
               <p>"I care not for that, if there is a chance to pass them. Will you undertake to
                  lead in a column of boats, if I go in to try to take or destroy the new brig?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, for more guineas. If I get you in, I want a big bag
                     full—<emph>full!</emph> for old Joe likes to hear 'em jingle."</p>
               <p>"You shall have them, my man, if you get us in. Once in, I will get out, if I have
                  to land my men, and storm the batteries to do it. Will you try? There is no moon
                  until after twelve to-night."</p>
               <p>"And the tide runs flood till eleven. You could drift in and make no noise," said
                  Joe, after a thoughtful pause of a few moments, "Yes, sir, for a bag of guineas I
                  will try."</p>
               <p>"Very well. I will make signal to the other vessels, telling them what
                  preparations to make, and when to be ready. Then I and the Tenedos will stand out
                  to sea, to lull all suspicions, and not to come in again until dark. You will stay
                  on board this ship, and we will keep your boat in tow."</p>
               <p>"I'm contented, sir, as long as the guineas keep coming. I'll be richer yet than
                  them that call me a fool, and make a mockery of me. I've borne it for years, but
                  some of 'em will be sorry for it yet, when they find that old Joe knows enough to
                  ruin 'em. I can catch eels and porgies, and I can catch Yankees, too, if I am a
                  fool, and go ragged and dirty, They laugh when I tell 'em I'm a son of King
                  George; but they'll cry when they find out it's true. That's what they will."</p>
               <p>"Well, well, my man. Go with my steward now. He will give you some grog and
                  something to eat, and I will have the signals made."</p>
               <p>Half-witted Joe now left the cabin with the steward, and Captain Brooks sent for
                  his supper.</p>
               <p>An hour or so afterwards, both of the frigates stood out to sea, but the schooner
                  remained off the mouth of the harbor.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <p>AT sunset, Clarence Rhett and his first mate stood upon the forecastle of the
                  Cloud-rift, watching the two English frigates, as they stood out to sea under a
                  full press of canvass, leaving only the schooner to guard the mouth of the
                  harbor.</p>
               <p>"What do you think of it?" asked the young captain of his mate. "Do you think they
                  have got tired watching us, and consider the schooner strong enough to do it
                  alone?"</p>
               <p>"Hardly that, sir," said Cromwell. "Them frigates are mighty lofty, you know, and
                  their look-outs may have sighted some sail in the offing, which we can't see from
                  here; and if so, they have gone out to see what they are."</p>
               <p>"Possibly. They are crowding sail, as if they were in a hurry. But they may have
                  run out to decoy us into a scrape.<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6960-00000009"/> They
                  may think that we will try to run by the schooner, or even that we might engage
                  her, and just stand out till darkness concealed their motions, and come back to
                  help her, if we were to try to go out in spite of her. These men-of-war's men are
                  tricky customers."</p>
               <p>"That's so, sir, and if I may be so bold as to offer my advice, I'd lay quiet
                  here, if I was you, until the coast is fairly clear of 'em, if it takes a week or
                  two. For every day we spend in drilling our own crew, and in getting the new hands
                  used to the ropes, adds to our strength. I'd rather have a crew of thirty men that
                  know their duty, than one or two hundred that didn't."</p>
               <p>"You are right, Mr. Cromwell, and I shall stay in port, and exercise the men until
                  I can get outside without danger Once on blue water, we will run our chances with
                  the best of them. Where we are too weak to fight, we will be fleet enough to
                  run."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, if the craft does as well as she looks. But it's time we hauled down
                  our colors, and set the first watch. I see the last of the sun just giving a touch
                  of gold to that steeple over there."</p>
               <p>"Yes, it is near sunset. You may take the first watch to-night and call me at
                  midnight," said Rhett.</p>
               <p>"Very well, sir, and to give him an idea of his duty, and to talk him into an idea
                  of the value of discipline, I'll ask Robert Everett to stand watch with me," said
                  Cromwell.</p>
               <p>"Yes, tell him it is my order that he does so," said the captain, turning to go to
                  the cabin.</p>
               <p>As he did so, he met Mr. Everett, the elder, face to face, for the old merchant
                  had just come on board, and had come forward to meet the young commander.</p>
               <p>"There go two of the bull dogs from their guard-post, sir," said Clarence, as he
                  pointed to the fast receding frigates. Mr. Cromwell and myself here have been
                  trying to think what they are leaving for; whether they want to decoy us out, or
                  are really going off in earnest."</p>
               <p>"I'm afraid there's a trick in it," said Mr. Everett. "Since I left you I have
                  been making diligent inquiries after half-witted Joe. I find that he went out of
                  the harbor early this morning, and a boy, who came up from the lighthouse, says,
                  he saw a periagua boat, like his, run along-side of the man-of-war schooner a
                  little after sunrise, and after staying there a little while, make sail, and run
                  down to one of the frigates. And he did not see her again. I'm afraid that,
                  'half-witted,' as they call him, he is smart enough to play the spy and traitor
                  here. You know how often he goes to Boston, without any apparent business there. I
                  came down to put you on your guard, and advise you to keep a close lookout. They
                  might try to destroy the vessel, and thus prevent the damage she is sure to do, if
                  she once gets out clear of them."</p>
               <p>"Let them come," said Clarence, with a smile. "They shall find us with shotted
                  guns, and arms in our hands."</p>
               <p>"That is right. I know that you will take care of your craft, if you are only
                  warned in time of an approaching danger. The night will be dark, and boats might
                  get up past the batteries, with muffled oars."</p>
               <p>"If they some, a full watch will be on deck to repel them, and it will be but a
                  few seconds after an alarm, before all hands will be awake and ready for action,"
                  said Clarence.</p>
               <p>"All right, and to make sure, I will myself go down to the batteries and caution
                  the guards to be vigilant," said Mr. Everett.</p>
               <p>"I will do more, sir; I will put a boat on picket in mid channel, just this side
                  of the batteries, as soon as it is dark enough for them to take position unseen by
                  any one. Caution the battery guard not to fire on my boat, which will be at her
                  post exactly at eight o'clock."</p>
               <p>"I will; and now be watchful. I may come on board again," replied Mr. Everett.</p>
               <p>"All right, sir, if hailed, give your name, and you will stand in no danger of an
                  unpleasant salute from our watch."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
               <p>WHEN young Everett was told by Cromwell that Captain Rhett wished him to join him
                  in the first watch, he cheerfully acquiesced, for it was a part of his present
                  policy to obey every order, and conform to every rule of discipline, since he
                  wished to make friends, and become as powerful as possible on board. One-half of
                  the enlisted crew—the star-board watch—was mustered on deck and arms served out to
                  every man. Each man had a cutlass, a pair of large pistols then in use on board of
                  men-of-war; cumbrous articles, with flint locks, and carrying an ounce ball, but
                  extremely efficient at close quarters, or as a club after being discharged.</p>
               <p>The night was clear but the moon was well along in its phase. and did not rise
                  until nearly midnight. The stars shone out, however, upon the quiet town, and the
                  harbor; but rippled with a gentle breeze, reflected millions of dancing lights
                  from their glancing faces.</p>
               <p>Having the mid watch, from twelve to four, to keep, Clarence Rhett gave his orders
                  and retired early to his cot which swung in the after cabin, and where he kept a
                  hanging lamp burning all the time, so that the last glance of his eyes, before
                  they closed in slumber, could rest upon the sweet face of his heart's angel.</p>
               <p>"Do you think there is any danger, to make it necessary to keep so many men up and
                  awake, Mr Cromwell?" asked young Everett, as he walked up and down the quarter
                  deck, by the side of the first mate.</p>
               <p>"There <emph>may</emph> be; but whether there is or not, there is nothing so good
                  as to have the men learn their duty early," replied Cromwell. "When we are in
                  other parts. English cruisers may try their favorite game of 'cutting out,' and we
                  must always be ready for them. Many of our hands are entirely green, and we must
                  break them in as soon as we can."</p>
               <p>"That is so," said Everett. "I only asked, for I thought our new Captain seemed
                  rather timid and nervous in putting on so large a watch, while we are here moored
                  to the pier."</p>
               <p>"You don't know captain Clarence Rhett as I do sir, or you would never think of
                  timidity or nervousness in him," said Cromwell promptly. "Why, sir, when a gang of
                  blood-thirsty pirates were thronging our decks at the Hoogly, and the best of us
                  thought all was lost, he was as cool as if he was driving sheep, and there was a
                  smile on his face while he was chopping them down, and taking a head at every
                  clip. There is no such thing as fear in his composition."</p>
               <p>"I am glad to hear you say so, sir," replied Everett, "With such a splendid
                  vessel, well found in every way, a good crew, and a brave Captain, we can win a
                  proud name on the sea."</p>
               <p>"Aye, and lots of prize money, too," said Cromwell, who had enough of the yankee
                  in him to keep a calculation of future profits in his mind. "And now we will take
                  a walk forward, to see if the men are awake and on the look out. I hear some of
                  the Hoogly's men spinning yarns and singing. That is all right on ordinary
                  occasions and at sea I like to hear it. But to-night we must have quiet so that
                  oars can be heard, if any are on the water.'</p>
               <p>The two mates started forward and had just got abreast of the foremast, when a
                  single musket shot, away down toward the mouth of the harbor, startled them As
                  they paused to listen, the first shot was followed by an irregular volley of
                  musketry and then in a minute or less afterward, came the flash and the heavy boom
                  of cannonry, from a shore battery.</p>
               <p>"All hands on deck!" shouted Cromwell, "Mr. Everett, call Captain Rhett, tell him
                  that there is an alarm from our picket boat in the channel, in the batteries
                  below. Then see that all the larboard watch are up."</p>
               <p>"Aye, aye sir," cried young Everett, and he hurried to obey orders, for cowardice
                  was not one of the many faults, and he rejoiced in the prospect of action</p>
               <p>In less than three minutes, Clarence Rhett was on deck: and when he got there, he
                  found the crew all at quarters, the guns ready for use, the matches<pb n="18-19"
                     xml:id="VAC6960-00000010"/> alight, and the crew prepared for defence.</p>
               <p>After the first volley of musketry, only a few scattering shots were heard, and
                  then the cheering of men came distinctly over the water.</p>
               <p>"The enemy are trying to pass our picket boat and the batteries, sir," said the
                  mate. "And we'll soon know whether they've succeeded or not, for the tide is
                  running in like a mill-race; and once past the batteries, boats would come up like
                  a streak. There goes another salute from the batteries; and their shot fly well up
                  this way. The boats must have passed them."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said the young Captain, drawing his sword, Mr. Everett's present, for the
                  first time.</p>
               <p>Stepping forward where all the crew <unclear>could</unclear> see him in the
                  starlight, he said in a firm, cheerful tone:</p>
               <p>"Boys, it is likely we will have some lively work here in a few minutes. Remember
                  that we are where our own townsmen will be witness to our deeds. Let the British
                  learn, that the crew of the gallant Cloud-rift know how to take care of her, and
                  to punish those who interfere with her, in port, or out of it."</p>
               <p>A loud cheer broke from every lip, and Clarence Rhett felt that he could depend on
                  his crew, new as they were to such duties as were now opening.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Cromwell, take charge forward," he cried. "Depress the forecastle gun for use
                  at close quarters, and throw in a couple of cases more canister. Mr. Everett, you
                  remain here on the quarter-deck, and look out for the after gun. I will take post
                  amidship, where I can keep an eye fore and aft. Gather in the larboard waist, all
                  you small-arm-men, and look to the priming of your muskets. Pikemen and boarders,
                  take post on the bows and quarters, and be wide-awake for orders. Every gunner to
                  his station, and work sharp when the time comes."</p>
               <p>These orders given in a cool and decided tone, told the crew that they had a man
                  for a leader, even if he was young; and even the most timid of them felt reassured
                  by the quiet and easy manner of the commander.</p>
               <p>All was now still for a few moments, and the crew of the Cloud-rift listened,
                  almost breathlessly, for the approach of the enemy.</p>
               <p>They had not long to wait. In a few minutes, there was a dash of oars in the water
                  heard very plainly, though the oars, muffled in the oarlocks, made no other
                  noise.</p>
               <p>At the same time, a dark mass in the channel could be seen coming up rapidly.</p>
               <p>"A large column of boats," said Clarence Rhett, as he glanced over the side.
                  'Ready with the guns, before they scatter to board. Depress well, and do not fire
                  without orders."</p>
               <p>Then <choice>

               <p>"Boats ahoy! Who are you? Keep off, or I'll fire!"</p>
               <p>"Fire and be d—d! We'll soon let you know who we are!" shouted a stern voice in
                  reply.</p>
               <p>"Let them have it!" shouted Clarence, and ere the words had fairly left his lips,
                  his three eighteen pounders, loaded almost to the muzzle with grape and canister,
                  belched forth their deadly contents.</p>
               <p>"Ready, musket men! Fire low, and let them have it!" shouted Clarence, the moment
                  the large guns had been discharged. 'Boarders and pike-men stand to your posts and
                  let no Englishman touch <choice>
                     <sic>onr</sic>
                     <corr>our</corr>
                  </choice> deck!"</p>
               <p>The cannon and the boats were so close together, that the report of the first
                  drowned the crashing sound of splintering planks in the second; and the muskets
                  and pistols, following in a second after, killed all other sounds.</p>
               <p>Anxiously Clarence Rhett looked out through the clouds of smoke, which belched
                  from the side of his vessel, to see what damage he had already done, and whether
                  the foe had got strength enough left to try to carry him by boarding.</p>
               <p>He had not long to wait. In two or three minutes some boats were seen close
                  alongside, and with a faint cheer, mingled with the groans and yells of the
                  wounded men, their crews madly strove to climb the bulwarks of the privateer. But
                  they were met by pikes and cutlasses, and pistol balls, at every point, and in
                  spite of the gallant acts of several officers, who strove hard to cut their way on
                  board, they were repelled fore and aft. One or two, indeed, got to the deck of the
                  Cloud-rift, but they only got there to fall dead or helpless on the deck.</p>
               <p>The action, wildly desperate, did not last fifteen minutes, and then the same
                  stern voice which had answered the first hail, was heard shouting:</p>
               <p>"It's no use—fall back, men! They're too many for us!"</p>
               <p>A wild, glad cheer broke from the crew of the Cloud-rift, when this cry was heard;
                  and as the English boats backed away in the cloud of smoke which was lying dense
                  over the harbor, the heavy guns and the musketry poured a parting remembrance
                  among the defeated Englishmen.</p>
               <p>Yells of pain and anger came back, telling that random shots had found soft spots
                  in the "hearts of oak," and then cheer after cheer rose from the decks of the
                  privateer, and from the crowd of citizens, who had gathered down upon the wharves
                  to witness what they had hardly dreamed of—a sea fight at their very doors.</p>
               <p>Clarence Rhett now ordered his own boats out, not so much to follow the enemy, as
                  to pick up any of their boats which had been disabled by his heavy guns, and to
                  aid the feebly-manned shore batteries, if the enemy in his <choice>
                     <sic>chargin</sic>
                     <corr>chagrin</corr>
                  </choice> and desperation, should try to carry them.</p>
               <p>He sent his first and second mates, with full crews and explicit orders, in these
                  boats, remaining on board himself, lest the enemy, rallying, should again try to
                  board him.</p>
               <p>When the boats were off, he turned his attention to the few who were wounded of
                  his own crew, and to the half-dozen Englishmen who had so desperately striven to
                  reach his deck, and who had paid for their temerity with their lives. One of
                  these, however, was yet alive, though badly wounded.</p>
               <p>Of him, as soon as he had been cared for by the surgeon, Clarence sought to know
                  what force had made the attempt upon him, and how they had got in past the
                  batteries so well.</p>
               <p>The man, who was a forward officer on board the frigate Shannon, stated that the
                  expedition consisted of ten boats, four from each of the frigates, and two from
                  the schooner outside, led by Captain Brooks in person; and that they had been
                  piloted in by a Salem fisherman, who had come out in a periagua. From the
                  description it was immediately known that the traitor was "Half-witted Joe."—Upon
                  being asked if the frigates had gone to sea that afternoon, he said they had, but
                  it was only a blind, for they had turned back the moment it was dark, and had
                  anchored as close as they dared to come.</p>
               <p>Mr. Everett was on board of the Cloud-rift within a few minutes after the British
                  had been so gallantly beaten off, and he grasped the hand of Captain Rhett with a
                  vice-like pressure, as he said:</p>
               <p>"Your brig is christened, my dear boy—nobly christened. and your crew tried and
                  found good. before her cut-water has kissed the ocean spray. I congratulate you,
                  for this is ominous of continued success."</p>
               <p>"I hope so, sir—I hope so. Why, the whole town seems to know the news already.
                  Hear the bells pealing."</p>
               <p>"Yes, were ten such frigates as those below, to land their crews now, you would
                  find men to beat them back. A little good fortune makes brave men out of cowards.
                  Do you think the English boats will get back by the batteries?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, most likely, for if you will look, you will see that it is clouding up.
                  A nor'-west gale is close upon us, and not a star is in sight now. They will creep
                  past the batteries if they can, for the wounded man says they were terribly cut up
                  in my first fire. They would have carried us by mere strength of numbers, if it
                  had not been for that. It is more than likely that full half their men are killed
                  and disabled. We will soon hear from the batteries if they can be seen as they go
                  out."</p>
               <p>But nothing more was heard from the batteries. An hour later, Cromwell and young
                  Everett returned with their boats, bringing two English boats in tow, which had
                  been deserted by the English Commander; the well men of their crews first taken
                  out, but the dead and badly<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6960-00000011"/> wounded left
                  in them. Among the latter was "Half-witted Joe," the traitor and pilot His left
                  arm had been shattered, and he had a musket ball through his thigh.</p>
               <p>But in spite of his agony, he clutched the bag of guineas which he had received
                  from the English Captain in his right hand, and swore bitterly at all who came
                  near him for he thought, of course, that they would rob him of the price of his
                  treachery.</p>
               <p>In reply to a question of Mr. Everett, as to what made him act so foully toward
                  those among whom he had lived so long, he boldly avowed that he was an Englishman,
                  and hated the Yankees, and had meant all the time, to do them the first ill turn
                  he could. All that he was sorry for was, that the expedition had failed, for if it
                  had succeeded, he was to have had another bag of guineas.</p>
               <p>"What will you do with him?" asked Mr. Everett of Rhett.</p>
               <p>"I would hang him if we were anywhere but in Salem," said the young captain. "As
                  it is, I shall turn him over to the civil authorities here, and they may hang him,
                  or let him rot in jail, I care not which. Luckily for us, we were prepared for an
                  attack, or else his treachery would have cost us this vessel, and probably the
                  lives of more than half the crew; for by the way they have acted to-night, I can
                  see how long they would have resisted, even in a hopeless case. I am ready to go
                  to sea now, for I have a crew that I know I can trust, and if it blows to-morrow,
                  as present appearances indicate, it will not be many hours before we are tossing
                  on the waters of the blue Atlantic."</p>
               <p>"How did my son behave?" asked the old merchant, with a look of anxiety. "I hope
                  he showed no signs of flinching in the face of the enemy."</p>
               <p>"None, sir; he acted bravely. No one could do better. I watched him as closely as
                  I could, while attending to others," replied Clarence. "If he only keeps on as he
                  has begun, you will have reason to be proud of him, before our first cruse is
                  over."</p>
               <p>"I rejoice to hear it," said Mr. Everett. "I told you that if you would take him
                  in hand, you could do something with him. I hear now nothing but good accounts of
                  him, on shore as well as here. If his reformation is certain, he may consider it a
                  bright day when he came under your command. Continue to be firm with him, as well
                  as kind, and he will yet be an honor to his name and race. And now, my dear young
                  friend, I must hurry back to the house, for my sweet Nellie will be almost dead
                  with anxiety and suspense, until she knows that the enemy have been beaten off,
                  and who are hurt, and who are sate."</p>
               <p>And the old merchant again pressed the hand of Clarence warmly, spoke a kind word
                  to his son, and then went on shore.</p>
               <p>Clarence now had the crew mustered aft, and, in a few well chosen words, thanked
                  them for their coolness and gallantry.</p>
               <p>"You have made no prize-money to-night, my men" said he, "but you have saved your
                  vessel, proved to your countrymen what you are made of, and taught the haughty
                  Britain a hard lesson. This is our first action, but it will not be our last.
                  Before twenty-four hours are over, I hope to have you at sea, and then you shall
                  have a chance to strike for fortune, as well as fame. One watch will now go below,
                  the other will stay on deck."</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
               <p>BEFORE day dawned, a furious gale was blowing from the north-west. Clarence Rhett
                  was on deck, with his spy glass in his hand, looking anxiously toward the mouth of
                  the harbor, to see if his enemies were yet on the watch. The first glimpse of
                  daylight, showed their black hulls at anchor as close in as they could get,
                  pitching and tossing heavily on the rough sea, but holding on with their ground
                  tackle, evidently intending to ride the gale out there, if it was possible.</p>
               <p>"What a bother it is, sir, there never was a better wind to get out of here with!"
                  said Cromwell, coming on deck, and looking at the sight which his young commander
                  was contemplating.</p>
               <p>"It is indeed annoying," said Clarence. "I have been thinking how I could induce
                  those gentlemen to try deeper water for a fishing ground. If they lay there until
                  this blow is over, the Lord only knows how long we will be cooped up in here."</p>
               <p>"They are closer in than they were yesterday," said Cromwell.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and in short range of that long point, covered with pine," said Clarence.
                  "If I could put a couple of heavy guns on wheels, and run them down there quietly
                  under cover of the brushy trees, I think I could get a short range, and give them
                  notice to quit, which they could'nt avoid receiving. They are rolling so at
                  anchor, that a return fire would be comparatively harmless."</p>
               <p>"That is so, sir, and Mr. Everett has two long twenty-fours in his store yard,
                  that would do the thing as nice as could be. Why not lash two stout drays
                  together, and get these guns down there to make a battery? The British never can
                  land in such a sea-way, to stop us, and we could get all fixed in three or four
                  hours, to sink them where they lay, or make them be on their anchorage."</p>
               <p>"That is so," said Clarence, brightening at the thought. "Have the men get
                  breakfast at once, while I go up and look at the guns, and see what I can do. If
                  we can drive them off, we will soon be where we will ask no odds of them."</p>
               <p>And the young Captain landed and hurried away, while the first mate had all hands
                  called, and bade them breakfast as soon as they could, for there was more work
                  ahead.</p>
               <p>"May I ask what it is, sir?" said young Everett, in a low tone, as he stood by
                  Cromwell's side on the quarter-deck.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, to carry out a plan of the Captain's, to put them bull-dogs out there
                  on the run," said the mate. "He has gone ashore to get ready, for he wants to be
                  at sea and at work. Our boys proved last night that they are made of good stuff,
                  and he wants to give them plenty to do."</p>
               <p>"I am glad of it," said the second mate, "I got a taste of service last night, and
                  now I'd like to have as much as will keep us busy."</p>
               <p>"No fear but we will, when we get outside," said Cromwell. "But we may as well get
                  breakfast ourselves, Mr. Everett, for when the Captain comes back we will have
                  work to do, I expect."</p>
               <p>The two mates now went below, leaving the deck in charge of the Boatswain.</p>
               <p>Clarence Rhett was not long absent from his vessel. He found the guns described by
                  Cromwell, and at once engaged Mr. Everett's draymen to get teams and their
                  heaviest drays together, for the purpose of transporting them to the place where
                  he intended to plant his battery.</p>
               <p>To conceal his plans from the curious, and to prevent an idle crowd from going to
                  the place, he had a quantity of old sails collected to cover the drays and guns,
                  and told the draymen to throw a quantity of old cordage over all, so as to deceive
                  any one who might notice the load.</p>
               <p>When the guns were ready for removal, he returned to the Cloudrift to select a
                  good party of gunners, and men to carry down ammunition for use in his battery.
                  When all was ready, he left young Everett in charge on board, and took Cromwell
                  with him, and his selected men.</p>
               <p>As they were leaving the vessel, Mr. Everett, the Senior, went with them, having
                  received a message sent to him by young Rhett.</p>
               <p>"You wanted me," he said, "your note reached me while I was at breakfast."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, I am going to exercise a party of my men at target practise, said
                  Rhett. "I thought perhaps you would like to witness their skill."</p>
               <p>"To be sure I would. But are you not going to use your own guns on board the
                  vessel?" asked the old merchant.</p>
               <p>"No, sir, not this time. I have borrowed a couple of your spare cannon back of the
                  store, and they are already on their way to a very excellent spot to mount them.
                  If you will go with us, we will show you a specimen of what sailors can do
                  ashore."</p>
               <p>"Very well, my friend, I am with you."</p>
               <p>Clarence now led the way by one of the<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6960-00000012"/>
                  back streets, to the rear of the town, following the route by which he had already
                  sent the guns.</p>
               <p>Out of town, fortunately without attracting attention and drawing a crowd, they
                  took a road which led down by a low range of sandy knolls to the viny grove, that
                  formed so fine a cover for their operations. At the edge of this grove they
                  overtook the draymen with the cannon; and here the party made a halt, while
                  Clarence and Cromwell, accompanied by Mr. Everett, went to look out the best spot
                  for planting the battery.</p>
               <p>An excellent position was soon found, on the very edge of a cliff which overhung
                  the ocean, not a half-a-mile from where the British vessels lay rolling and
                  tossing at their anchors. This cliff cornered by a thicket of dwarfy cedars,
                  formed a natural breast-work, and the surf rolling for miles above and below,
                  against the rocky shore, would effectually prevent any landing, however much the
                  enemy might desire it, for the purpose of silencing the battery.</p>
               <p>Cromwell at once went back to bring up the guns and men, and soon all hands were
                  hard at work, and silently, too, as possible, in getting the heavy pieces mounted
                  on the temporary field-works.</p>
               <p>The bushes completely concealed their movements from the enemy, and Clarence
                  smiled as he saw the English Officers, clustered aft in each of their vessels,
                  looking up toward the town, and probably engaged in talking over the attack and
                  repulse of the previous night.</p>
               <p>After an hour of steady labor, the guns were got into position, and loaded with
                  round shot, ready for use. Only a narrow fringe of bushes had been left standing
                  between them and the edge of the cliff; and now Clarence caused enough of these to
                  be cut away, to enable the gunners to take aim at the targets before them. The
                  schooner was nearest, but she was the smallest mark; and the frigates were chosen
                  for the first trial.</p>
               <p>Clarence sighted one gun, and Cromwell the other, and when <unclear>all</unclear>
                  was ready, they both fired simultaneously. Clarence caught up his spy-glass as
                  soon as he fired, to mark the effect of his shot.</p>
               <p>"Did you hit your mark?" asked Mr Everett,</p>
               <p>"No, sir, but I have woke them up. My shot went just over the frigates hull, and
                  between her main and foremast. Cromwell has done better: he has cut away the sling
                  of the foreyard of his frigate. Both vessels are in a state of alarm. Officers and
                  men rushing to quarters, as if they didn't know what was coming next. Load the
                  guns again men—load carefully. I am not going to waste ammunition, and shall fire
                  slowly and surely."</p>
               <p>The gunners obeyed the order, and in three or four minutes more, the guns were
                  ready for <choice>
                     <sic>auother</sic>
                     <corr>another</corr>
                  </choice> discharge. Profiting by the result of the first fire, and taking a more
                  accurate aim, both Clarence and Cromwell this time threw their shot into the hulls
                  of the Englishmen.</p>
               <p>The latter had already manned their batteries, and now returned the fire with a
                  broadside directed at the cliff; for they could not see the guns of the well
                  masked shore battery, although the smoke very nearly revealed its <choice>
                     <sic>positiou</sic>
                     <corr>position</corr>
                  </choice>.</p>
               <p>Not a shot from the English batteries reached the elevation, where the American
                  guns were planted. Every one of their missiles struck the water or the cliff
                  below, and no damage was done on shore.</p>
               <p>"Load quick, we have got their range now, and we'll sink them where they lay, if
                  they are foolish enough to hold on!" cried Clarence, delighted with the effect of
                  his last two shots.</p>
               <p>The gunners worked with a will, but in silence, for all shouting was forbidden
                  now, and soon again two more twenty-four pound shot went crashing into the English
                  hulls.</p>
               <p>The frigates kept up a rapid but harmless fire; their crews exhibiting much
                  confusion; evidently receiving much harm from the American battery.</p>
               <p>Clarence and Cromwell still aimed their respective guns, keeping up their range
                  splendidly, and in a few minutes one of the frigates lost her mizzen-mast. The
                  schooner, which had fired three or four guns, was now seen to slip her anchor, and
                  to drift out toward the other vessels.</p>
               <p>Clarence determined that she should not go off unnoticed, and calling to Cromwell
                  to do the same, he took aim at her.</p>
               <p>Both again fired at once, and with such effect, that the main-mast of the schooner
                  went by the board, close down by the deck, carrying the fore-top-mast with it, and
                  making a wreck of everything aft.</p>
               <p>"Let her have it again, cut away her foremast, if it is a possible thing," cried
                  Clarence.</p>
               <p>Both guns were ready in a short time again, and the white splinters flew from the
                  black hull of the schooner after the second discharge.</p>
               <p>Her foresail was now partially hoisted, to hasten her departure from such a
                  dangerous post; but twice more was she struck before she rounded too, under the
                  lee of the nearest frigate.</p>
               <p>Good! she has got her breakfast!" cried Mr. Everett, as he saw how prettily she
                  had been driven off. Now give the big ones a bellyfull."</p>
               <p>Clarence needed no urging, and his men, finding that every shot from their guns
                     <emph>told</emph> upon the British hulls, while none of the returns did any
                  damage, worked with the fearlessness and energy which a sense of security is apt
                  to give.</p>
               <p>It soon became evident that the English were suffering severely. Their guns were
                  worked badly, and their shots were few and far between. At last, before an hour
                  had gone by, men were seen aloft, loosing sail; and in a very short time under all
                  the canvass that they dared to set, all three of the men-of-war were scudding off
                  to sea, with holes in their sails, as well as in their hulls, which told well for
                  the "target practice" of Clarence Rhett, and those who served under him.</p>
               <p>A wild, glad cheer broke from the lips of Clarence Rhett and his command, when the
                  English were seen to slip their anchors, and scud away from the coast.</p>
               <p>"Now, our road to sea is clear!" cried Clarence gleefully, as he turned to
                  Everett, "and lest the Bull-dogs should return again when the blow is over, I will
                  leave this battery where it is, and if the townsmen will man and guard it, there
                  will be little danger of any more men of war seeking an anchorage off the
                  harbor"</p>
               <p>"That is so," said Mr. Everett, "and I will see that this battery is made
                  permanent, and a guard assigned to it. It shall be called Battery
                     <emph>Rhett</emph>."</p>
               <p>"Battery Persuasion, would be a better name, sir," said Rhett, laughing, "for it
                  persuaded our English friends to leave in a hurry."</p>
               <p>"Yes, and I suppose now you will be off too, since the offing is clear."</p>
               <p>"I shall go out to-night, sir," replied Clarence." They will leave too, most
                  likely, as soon as they can, and keep close in with the coast while the gale
                  blows, for the nearer they are in, the smoother the sea will be. But as soon as it
                  is dark, I can shape my course for a range, in which their traders can be
                  found."</p>
               <p>"All right. You will have time to take one more dinner on shore with me, while my
                  butcher and grocer provides a farewell treat for your crew, and I will see you set
                  sail cheerfully. So far, the Cloud-rift's crew have proved worthy of the pretty
                  craft they are to sail in."</p>
               <p>Mr. Everett then walked back to the town with Clarence, while Cromwell and his
                  gunners followed in the rear. They did not go back alone and unheralded; for long
                  before the firing had ceased, all Salem was awakened to the fact, that a new
                  Battery was in play, and there were many witnesses to the short, but decisive
                  action, which we have pictured in the foregoing lines.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
               <p>"Two victories, before the prow of your beautiful vessel had parted the dark waves
                  of the azure ocean! Were I a man, I should be jealous of you, Clarence."</p>
               <p>These words were addressed to the hero of this story, as he set by the side of
                  Nellie Everett, after taking dinner with her and her father, on the day when he
                  had so successfully driven the British fleet to sea. Mr. Everett had left him to
                  take his farewell of Nellie, while he went down to the vessel to see if his
                     orders<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6960-00000013"/> had been obeyed, in regard to
                  furnishing all hands with a farewell repast on board the Cloud-rift.</p>
               <p>"I am very thankful that you are not a man, my dear Nellie," said Clarence,
                  pressing the small hand which he held to his lips. "And these victories, of which
                  so much importance is now made, will be thrown in the clouds, I hope, by those
                  which are to follow."</p>
               <p>"I hope the same glorious success, accompanied with safety to you and your crew,
                  will continue to be yours," said Nellie, "and now, Clarence, about the future.
                  Tell me where you will go to how I may write to you, or hear from you. It will be
                  very hard for me to spend long weeks, perhaps months, with no news from you to
                  cheer my anxious heart."</p>
               <p>"You will hear more from me, far more often than I can hope to hear from you,"
                  said Clarence. For I shall lose no opportunity to communicate to your father, the
                  news of our cruise, and no package shall be sent to him, which shall not contain a
                  note for you. But our course, and our where-abouts, will be determined altogether
                  by circumstances, at present unknown and impossible to foresee. I intend at first
                  to take a short run to the northward to try and intercept some of the storeships
                  bound into the Canadian ports, and then shall square away for the West India
                  Islands, running far enough out from the coast, to clear their blockading
                  squadrons off our large ports. If I take any prizes and send them in, they will
                  bring letters to you and your father. If I meet any of our own men-of-war they,
                  too, will be mail carriers for me. And in my letters I will tell you where to
                  direct to me, if I can."</p>
               <p>"Well I must hope and be patient, I suppose" said Nellie, with a sigh.</p>
               <p>Then taking from her pocket a small package, sealed up neatly, she said.</p>
               <p>"This little parcel is not to be opened by Captain Rhett untill he is out of sight
                  of hand. Do you understand, sir."</p>
               <p>"Yes, dear Nellie, I am sailing under sea led orders, I suppose. I know there is
                  something very precious in it; but as I have not a woman's curiosity, I can
                  deposit it in my vest pocket quietly, until the time arrives to open it."</p>
               <p>"A <emph>woman's</emph> curiosity, sir. Now I suppose yon are severe upon our sex.
                  I am sure I possess but little curiosity, since I actually went to sleep last
                  night after I heard the firing down at the wharf, before I learned what it was all
                  about."</p>
               <p>"Your father tells a different tale, dear Nellie; but you know that woman's
                  curiosity brought all the evil that ever fell to the lot of man upon us. If Eve
                  had not been curious."</p>
               <p>"You, men, would have all been born fools!" said Nellie, interrupting him with a
                  gay laugh. "It was Eve who had courage while poor, cowardly Adam didn't know
                  enough to dress himself. Never twit us with a crime in being curious, since our
                  curiosity was the foundation of all the <choice>
                     <sic>knowlede</sic>
                     <corr>knowledge</corr>
                  </choice> that you poor masculines ever inherited from father Adam."</p>
               <p>"Well, Nellie, you are more <emph>logical</emph> than I, and I will not attempt to
                  controvert your opinions."</p>
               <p>"More <emph>theological</emph> you mean, Clarence," said Nellie, with a smile. "I
                  shall study my bible a good deal while you are gone. Especially the history of
                  Jonah. Don't you think he had a gay time while he was on his whaling voyage?"</p>
               <p>"Not having read his log-book of the cruise, I cannot say." said Clarence; "but I
                  have got to be off, Nellie. It is nearly night and the moment that the last of
                  daylight leaves us, I must be off with the brig; for this Nor'west gale must carry
                  me clear of the coast. Once fairly outside I can choose my own company I think;
                  for the Cloud-rift will not find her match in speed is my opinion."</p>
               <p>"I hope not. It is hard to say farewell, Clarence, but it must be spoken," said
                  Nellie, trying to speak with a firm tone."</p>
               <p>But her voice trembled, and her eyes were liquid with a feeling too deep and too
                  sad for utterance.</p>
               <p>"We will soon meet again, and, when this war is over, I hope we will meet never
                  more to part," said Clarence. "I know that your father likes and respects me, and
                  the success which I hope for, and<emph>will</emph> deserve, will embolden me to
                  ask from him this hand, worth more a million times, than all the treasure he has
                  amassed."</p>
               <p>"You will not ask in vain, when you come back, Clarence," she said gently, "when
                  he knows that all my heart is yours, and my happiness rest, alone with you, he
                  will deny us nothing."</p>
               <p>"There was a warm embrace, one fond lingering pressure of their lips, and the
                  lovers parted to meet—<emph>when</emph>?'</p>

               <p>THE black scud flew yet swiftly overhead before the wild north-west gale, when
                  darkness closed in over the town of Salem. On <choice>

                     <corr>board</corr>
                  </choice> of the Cloud rift, before dark, there had been no open preparation made
                  for an early departure, though not one of her crew or officers were allowed to go
                  on shore; for it was understood that she must be ready for sailing at any
                  moment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Everett had taken an affectionate farewell of Clarence Rhett and his son, in
                  the after cabin, just before dark.</p>
               <p>"Robert," said he to the latter, "your good conduct for the past few days has
                  given me warm hopes of your future. Continue to be a <emph>man</emph>, and all
                  that fortune and the true affection of a father can do to advance your interests
                  shall be done. Obey Captain Rhett implicitly trust always to his judgment and you
                  will please me, and advance your own welfare."</p>
               <p>"I will sir, I will," said Robert Everett, with a tone and look so earnest, that
                  it would hardly seem that was his heart yet rotten with hypocrisy.</p>
               <p>But it was just at night, Mr. Everett went on <choice>
                     <sic>shere</sic>
                     <corr>shore</corr>
                  </choice>; and ten minutes after darkness had fairly set in, with not a light
                  visible except those where the compasses rested, the shore-fasts were all cast
                  off; and under her close reefed fore sail and balance reefed mainsail, with the
                  head of her fore-storm stay-sail run up, the Cloud-rift began to move down the
                  harbor.</p>
               <p>Both watchers were on deck, but strict silence was enjoined. Even the leadmen in
                  the fore-channels taking the soundings, gave the depth of water in a tone only
                  audible to men standing close by them, and passing the word aft to the commander,
                  who, at the wheel, acted as <emph>pilot</emph> also; for there was hardly a port
                  or inlet on the Atlantic coast, to which Clarence Rhett was a stranger.</p>
               <p>As the Cloud-rift drew off from the shore, and began to feel the full force of the
                  gale, her speed increased, until, when fairly outside of all the head lands and
                  shoals, she rushed through and over the heavy seas like a mad monster of life,
                  which spurned alike the winds and waters.</p>
               <p>"She rides like a bird!" said Clarence, to Cromwell, the latter being on the lee
                  side of the wheel helping him to steer.</p>
               <p>"She does, indeed, sir. If we had daylight with us, she'd run the land out of
                  sight, at this rate, in two hours. Do you think them Englishmen will lay off for
                  us?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, if they can. I shall haul off to the north'ard as soon as we reach twenty
                  fathoms water, for I'm sure they're further off than that. If the frigate were out
                  of the way, I wouldn't mind meeting the schooner at all. With her main mast gone,
                  she is badly crippled, and we could lay her aboard without trouble."</p>
               <p>"She'll keep with them, if she can," said Cromwell.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps she will try to run up to St. Johns, or Halifax, to get a new mast in;
                  though she could hardly haul up close enough, under her forward sails, to lay a
                  northerly course. After I get a good offing. I will heave too till daylight, if
                  the wind keeps up, for then, no matter what we see at daylight, we can run to it,
                  or from it, as our interest bids us do."</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>Twenty</emph> fathoms, sir!' said a messenger from the leadsmen.</p>
               <p>"Good, Mr. Cromwell, go forward and have the staysail hauled down. Then come aft,
                  and take in the mainsail, and brace the fore-yard sharp up. We will heave too with
                  our head to port. I can steer her alone, for she minds her helm, as a
                  tender-mouthed horse obeys the rein."</p>
               <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6960-00000014"/>
               <p>The mate went forward, and carried out the different orders promptly; and in a
                  little while, the Cloud-rift, under her close-reefed foresail, braced sharp up,
                  and sheeled close aft, was laying as snug to the wind as possible, making scarcely
                  any lee-way, and forging ahead just enough to keep her under steerage control</p>
               <p>One watch was now sent below to sleep, while the other remained on deck, ready for
                  any duty required.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
               <p>As the first mate had the first watch on deck, the second mate, Robert Everett,
                  was called to take charge at midnight. Until this time, Clarence Rhett had
                  remained on deck, but now, after telling young Everett to keep a
                     <unclear>careful</unclear> look-out for lights in all directions, also to watch
                  the soundings carefully, and to call him if a light was seen, or shoal water
                  found, he went below to take some sleep; for he had been awake all the night
                  before, and found rest now quite necessary.</p>
               <p>As Cromwell's watch came on again at four in the morning, he, of course, hurried
                  down to his berth to get what sleep he could, while his watch was below.</p>
               <p>While the captain and his first officer were below, young Everett had a chance to
                  converse with his particular chums, Otis, Bascomb, and Brattle. Neither or them
                  were yet sufficiently skilled in seamanship, to take a trick at the wheel,
                     <emph>trick</emph> at cards being their greatest forte; but Robert had managed
                  to get them in his watch as "waisters," for they could pull and haul on sheets and
                  braces, as well as seamen; and they were handy when he moved forward on the
                  quarter deck, where he could converse with them without attracting any particular
                  attention from others, for it might be supposed, that they, being-green-horns,
                  were receiving instructions in their duties, etc.</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, we're off at last,' said Otis, approaching Everett, as the latter
                  halted in his quarter deck promenade, close by the starboard fife-rail.</p>
               <p>"Yes—how do you boys stand it?—Sea-sick any?" asked Everett.</p>
               <p>"I'm not," said Otis. "But Bascomb has been contributing his supper to Neptune.
                  Brattle and I have been out fishing too often not to have got over such
                  weaknesses. How does temperance agree with you, sir?"</p>
               <p>"First rate, while I had the eyes of the old man on me ashore. It will do very
                  well here, with a little help from a private flask once in a while. I'm devilish
                  sorry my rank will keep us from having a game of cards now and then; but this
                  won't last always. I've got a hard game to play, but I'll come out the
                     <emph>winner</emph> in the end. You boys must play your parts well. Get every
                  man you can on my side, and by and by we'll see whether Captain Clarence Rhett is
                  the head pin or not."</p>
               <p>"We'll do our part, never fear," replied young Otis. "Keep smooth with the
                  Captain, and make him think you are as good as if you belonged to the church, and
                  get his eyes well closed. When he does get them open, it will be too late to do
                  him any good. We've got more than half the crew our own sort now, and it's a pity
                  if we can't work over full half the rest of 'em. What a Sea Rover this craft would
                  be if she was independent, and had a Captain who dared to make war on all the
                  world. Wine and women, gold and jewels,—Eh, my boy?'</p>
               <p>"Yes—yes, but don't hint about that yet," said young Everett hastily. "There are
                  not many, even of our own set, bold enough, to think of that yet. But let them get
                  used to blood-shed, and we can easily work them over to thinking as you and I
                  do."</p>
               <p>"That is so—we can wait," said Otis.</p>
               <p>"Light, ho!' sung out a look-out from forward.</p>
               <p>"Where away?" asked Everett, hurrying forward to the side of the man who spoke,
                  and whose station was at the weather side of the forecastle.</p>
               <p>"Just a point or two to windward of the bow, sir—almost ahead when the brig comes
                  up to the wind,' said the man, who was one of the old seamen from the Hoogly.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I see it now. Keep your eye on it, and see if we rise it any, while I send
                  word to the Captain," said the young mate; and going aft, he sent Otis to inform
                  the Captain of the discovery.</p>
               <p>In a few minutes, Clarence was on deck with his night glass in his hand. Going
                  forward, he looked at the light long and earnestly. At times it could scarcely be
                  seen, and then again it seemed to shine out quite distinctly.</p>
               <p>"It is on a vessel," he said at last. "It will be daylight in a little more than
                  an hour, and then we can see what she is if she is none too like ourselves. If the
                  light seems to leave us before then, we must make sail, and try to keep it in
                  sight. I will remain on deck with you, Mr. Everett."</p>
               <p>The young man bowed, and seemed pleased when the Captain joined him in walking the
                  quarter-deck; and when the latter entered into a friendly conversation, speaking
                  about the vessel and the crew, and the cruise which had commenced, he responded in
                  the most open and cheerful way. This greatly pleased Clarence, for, until this
                  time, he and the young man had been for years at open variance; Everett taking
                  every chance to quarrel with him, and insult him, when they met. He seemed,
                  indeed, bent on a thorough reformation, for no one could be more deferential or
                  respectful than he now was.</p>
               <p>The time flew rapidly while they walked and talked, and as the light was yet in
                  sight of the look-outs, there was no alteration made in the course of the
                  vessel.</p>
               <p>When the darkness of night began to change into the gray of the dawning day,
                  Clarence Rhett left the quarter deck and taking post forward, anxiously looked to
                  see what the vessel which had shown the light, would turn out to be.</p>
               <p>In a short time it was light enough for him to distinguish a vessel, not more than
                  a mile off, on his weather bow, and in a few moments more, he plainly recognised
                  her through his glass. It was the schooner, which had been at anchor off Salem
                  harbor the day before, and which had lost her mainmast when under fire of his
                  shore battery.</p>
               <p>She was hove too on the same tack as the Cloud-rift, under a close reefed
                  foresail, and seemed to labor a good deal in the heavy sea that was running. A
                  jury main-mast had been got up, much smaller than that which had been carried
                  away, yet large enough to be of some use in making her steer easy, with a sailing
                  breeze.</p>
               <p>Stiff as the gale was, trusting in the craft beneath him, Clarence Rhett at once
                  had his close reefed mainsail and fore staysail set, and, bringing the brig by the
                  wind, hauled up in chase of the schooner, setting his flag as he did so.</p>
               <p>The schooner evidently had not been aware of his vicinity during the night, and
                  that she was now in no condition to escape, or avoid an encounter, was
                  apparent.</p>
               <p>Her commander did not feel inclined, either, to endeavor to avoid one; for he at
                  once hoisted his colors, and the sound of his drum beating to quarters, could be
                  distinctly heard on board the brig.</p>
               <p>All hands were called at once on board the latter, and she was speedily cleared
                  for action. Finding that, with his whole spars and snugly trimmed sails, he could
                  haul up well to windward of the schooner, and choose his own position for attack,
                  Rhett buffed up close to the wind, and soon had the schooner at fair gun shot on
                  his lee beam. She did not seem inclined to commence the fight, however, though she
                  showed more guns than the brig, but they appeared to be of lighter calibre.</p>
               <p>Rhett had sent look-outs to scan the horizon in every direction, to see if the
                  frigates were in sight; but no sail was visible except the schooner. Finding that
                  she was in no hurry to begin the strife, and yet made no attempt to get out of his
                  way, Rhett ordered his crew to get their breakfast before he closed.</p>
               <p>An hour was thus spent, and then, all being ready, Rhett ordered the helm of <choice>
                     <sic>tha</sic>
                     <corr>the</corr>
                  </choice> brig to be put up, and her sheets eased off a little, and he began
                  edging down on the stranger. His gunners were all at their stations, the guns
                     double<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6960-00000015"/> shotted, and all ready for
                  work; but the sea ran very high, making aim at a long range uncertain, so he
                  determined to get into close quarters before he opened fire.</p>
               <p>The crew of the privateer were all on deck and in high spirits, for their first
                  successes had made them bold and confident.</p>
               <p>The two vessels were now in a short half mile of each other, and the brig, under
                  the most canvass, was rapidly lessening the distance between them. Suddenly, there
                  was a puff of smoke seen to belch from the weather side of the English vessel, and
                  before the report of the gun came up, against the wind, to the ears of Clarence
                  Rhett and his crew, a shot threw up the spray close aboard.</p>
               <p>"If that is her game, give her the benefit of our iron!" cried Clarence to his
                  gunners. "Fire as fast as you can get your guns to bear, but do not throw a shot
                  away."</p>
               <p>The order was obeyed by the veterans from the Hoogly who had been selected to man
                  the guns of the brig, and a slow, but most accurate fire was opened. In a few
                  minutes the brig answered with every gun that she could bring to bear, and the
                  action became <choice>
                     <sic>geneaal</sic>
                     <corr>general</corr>
                  </choice>. Rhett still kept his vessel headed well down toward the Englishman,
                  drawing rather ahead all the time; and the latter, seeing that he intended so to
                  head-reach as to be able to cross her bow and rake her, kept away before the wind.
                  This made it necessary for Rhett to shorten sail, to keep from running by the
                  schooner, and he speedily took in all his canvass but his foresail.</p>
               <p>The vessels, keeping up a rapid, and far from harmless fire, were now within
                  hailing distance, but the deafening roar of the guns, and the crack of musketry
                  were too loud for human voices to be heard while they continued.</p>
               <p>So far, the casualities on board the Cloud-rift had been few, though her hull and
                  spars had <unclear>suffered</unclear> some, and a few of her men had been wounded.
                  Calm and quiet, with an eye to everything, young Rhett issued his orders, and
                  proudly saw that his crew received and obeyed them as if they had been veterans,
                  instead of new hands at such work.</p>
               <p>Matters could not continue long thus, without serious damage to one or the other;
                  and it soon came to the Englishman, for his foremast, wounded by the battery on
                  shore before, now received another shot, and came tumbling down, with all its
                  spars attached.</p>
               <p>This left the schooner completely disabled, rolling helpless in the trough of the
                  sea; and Rhett. taking advantage of her position, shot ahead, and bore away across
                  her bow.</p>
               <p>The Englishman knew but too well, that a raking broadside from the privateer would
                  sweep his deck, already encumbered with dead and wounded, and he hauled down his
                  colors before the privateer had opened her raking fire.</p>
               <p>"What vessel is that?" asked Rhett, as he ran down across the schooner's bow, and
                  then luffed up again close under her lee.</p>
               <p>"She <emph>was</emph> His Majesty's Schooner Spitfire," said the commanding
                  officer sullenly. "but she is now <emph>your</emph> prize.—She will do you but
                  little good, however, for she is filling fast, and will sink in an hour or
                  two."</p>
               <p>This was evidently true, for the remainder of the British crew were at the pumps,
                  and the clean water which belched out from her <unclear>scupper</unclear> holes,
                  told that it was pouring in faster than they could pump it out.</p>
               <p>The sea was rough indeed for boat service, but humanity demanded that aid should
                  be rendered to get the British crew out of their sinking vessel, and nobly did the
                  privateersmen go to work to do it, not heeding the risk, or the labor.</p>
               <p>In less than an hour, all the living were safe on board the Cloud-rift; and soon
                  after the schooner, dismantled and shot-riddled, went out of sight beneath the
                  water.</p>
               <p>"Honorable, but profitless, was the remark of Clarence Rhett, as he saw the
                  schooner go down. "And now," he added to Cromwell, "my original plan must be
                  altered. I had intended to run up into the Bay of Fundy, and look for some of the
                  English troop and store-ships that are coming over. But we are crowded with
                  prisoners, and the sooner we are rid of them the better. As soon as the gale lulls
                  I shall try to make port, either Salem, Boston, or new London, and turn in my
                  prisoners for exchange."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, they're nothing but a bother here; and we've got to keep a bright eye
                  and a strict guard on them all the time, for they are as wary as we are, and
                     <unclear>might</unclear> turn on us and try to take the brig," said
                  Cromwell.</p>
               <p>"Well, we will soon get rid of them, if nothing happens, for we have not got far
                  off the coast yet. But we are out of sight of land, and I must go below a minute,
                  to attend to something I had nearly forgotten."</p>
               <p>And young Rhett hastened to his cabin, to examine the sealed package which had
                  been given to him by Nellie Everett.</p>
               <p>When he opened it, he found an exquisitely painted miniature of herself, on ivory,
                  enclosed in a gold locket. With it was a slip of paper, with only these words;
                  "Take care of me and of yourself for me."</p>
               <p>The young Captain pressed the gift to his lips, and then placed it on his heart,
                  suspending it from his neck by the chain to which it was attached.</p>
               <p>When he returned on deck again, he had the brig hove around, with her head to the
                  southward and westward, and under easy sail, stood in toward the land.</p>
               <p>He questioned the late commander of the schooner as to the probable whereabouts of
                  the frigates, and learned from him, that one, or both, of them intended to lay off
                  the mouth of Boston Harbor, to wait for the frigate, which had been reported to
                  them as being nearly ready for sea.</p>
               <p>This decided Rhett to bear away for a more southern post, where he could get in to
                  land his prisoners with less difficulty and he hauled out more to the south ward,
                  making more sail as the gale gradually lessened.</p>
               <p>Like nor'westers generally, that blow had come butt-end first, for before night it
                  had died away almost to a calm; but as no sails were in sight, this did not
                  disturb young Rhett at all. He only had the more time to exercise his crew.</p>
               <p>When the English Officer who had lost his schooner, learned that he had been
                  defeated by a green crew, his mortification knew no bounds. He laid his misfortune
                  entirely, however, to the damage which he had received from the shore battery on
                  the day before: and it was true, that the injury, thus received, had crippled him
                  to a great extent; but when he saw the manner in which the crew of the Cloud-rift
                  worked their guns and their vessel in exercise, he had to confess that "green"
                  though the were, they were a dangerous enemy to encounter. His admiration of the
                  brig and her sailing qualities could not be concealed, and he acknowledged, that
                  he knew of no vessel, of her size, afloat, which could match her in any way.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
               <p>A DEAD calm followed the gale which had welcomed the <choice>
                     <sic>Clond-rift</sic>
                     <corr>Cloud-rift</corr>
                  </choice> to her ocean home. For two days and nights the brig drifted lazily upon
                  the slow-heaving sea, and, during all this time, not a single sail appeared in
                  sight: but on the morning of the third day, a slight breeze was felt, and by the
                  time that the moon observations were taken, the Cloud-rift had a five or six knot
                  breeze, and was standing in toward the land, on a westerly course, with every
                  stitch of canvass set which she could carry. She had drifted outside of soundings;
                  but before midnight soundings were found with the deep lead, and Clarence
                  shortened sail, so that he might not get into too shallow water before
                  daylight.</p>
               <p>Nothing had occured, in all this time, worth noticing, since the sinking of the
                  schooner. The usual routine of duty was performed, a strict guard kept over the
                  prisoners, and discipline preserved to the letter.</p>
               <p>Clarence was called according to his orders, at daylight on the fourth day, for he
                  expected, from the depth of water, that land would be in sight when there would be
                  light enough to see it by. He was not wrong, for the sun's first rays<pb n="30-31"
                     xml:id="VAC6960-00000016"/> slanted westward upon the grey rocks of the
                  Massachusetts coast.</p>
               <p>The land was so distant, that well acquainted as he was with the coast-marks,
                  Rhett could not at first say what particular place he was near; but he ordered all
                  sail set, and stood in toward it, to find out his location and bearing.</p>
               <p>The crew were turned up to breakfast at the usual hour, and then exercised at
                  general quarters, at the guns and with small arms. The breeze was light from the
                  southward and westward, and considerable time elapsed before the brig neared the
                  land sufficiently for Clarence to recognize any known point. In truth he had taken
                  his noon observation, when he made out two or three hilly islands near the mouth
                  of Boston harbor, and, almost at the same time, a sail was reported to
                  windward.</p>
               <p>Taking his glass he went aloft to examine the stranger, and found in a few moments
                  that he could have seen her nearly as well from deck for the scant sail she
                  carried made her look to be further off than she was.</p>
               <p>He recognized her as one of the English frigates, which he had seen off Salem
                  harbor but a few days before. Light as the wind was, she was under her three
                  topsails only, evidently laying off the mouth of the harbor to intercept vessels
                  going in, or coming out.</p>
               <p>The English commander who had lost his Schooner, asked permission to look at the
                  vessel through the glass, and Clarence handed it to him, asking if he knew what
                  vessel it was.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, I know her well and what she is there for," replied the Englishman, it
                  is his majesty's frigate, the Shannon, 38 guns, Captain Brooks commanding. "I
                  heard him say but a few days ago that he would give ten years pay to meet Captain
                  Lawrence in your frigate Chesapeake, which he heard was nearly ready to sail from
                  Boston and that he meant to challenge him to come out and fight him. The man who
                  piloted our boats in to attack your brig has been a spy upon the movements of the
                  Chesapeake, and he reported, when we lay off Salem, that she would be ready for
                  sea in three or four days."</p>
               <p>"Good!" said Clarence quietly. "Lawrence has already made his mark at sea, and he <choice>
                     <sic>wiil</sic>
                     <corr>will</corr>
                  </choice> be the last to shrink from action. He will give Captain Brooks all that
                  he wants, and as it is frigate against frigate, I will let them have a clean
                  field, I can run into Salem, and land you and your men-by night-time, and get to
                  sea again before another day dawns."</p>
               <p>And apparently quite unnoticed by the English frigate, though she was not over six
                  or seven miles distant; Clarence squared the brig away to the northward and
                  westward, heading for Salem harbor.</p>
               <p>The coast was now quite plain on their larboard beam, and most of the crew
                  recognized well known head-lands, as the brig slowly moved along before the light
                  breeze.</p>
               <p>"Are you going to return to port so soon sir?" asked young Everett in a respectful
                  tone, of Clarence, as the latter approached him while on watch on the quarter
                  deck.</p>
               <p>"Yes, but only to land our prisoners," said the young Captain. "I shall only
                  remain long enough to deliver them over to responsible authority, to be sent down
                  to Boston for exchange, I shall not allow the crew to leave the vessel at all, for
                  I shall go to sea again to-night; but if you want to go up to see your father and
                  sister for an hour or so, while we are landing the prisoners, you can do it."</p>
               <p>"Thank you sir I should like very well to tell them what I think of the vessel and
                  her Captain, since I have seen them tested in action," said the young man.</p>
               <p>"Speak of the <emph>crew</emph>—they deserve praise—but never mind alluding to me,
                  Mr. Everett your father knows I will do as well as I can, but I do not wish him to
                  think me too competent. If I am not well supported by my officers and crew, I can
                  do but little, though, so far, they have all sustained me nobly."</p>
               <p>"We will continue to do so sir," replied young Everett. "I am sorry to say, that I
                  used to be <choice>
                     <sic>predijuced</sic>
                     <corr>prejudiced</corr>
                  </choice> against you, and often acted shamefully toward you; but I have long
                  since seen my error in so thinking and acting, and will try while I serve under
                  you, to do my duty to you, and to atone for the past."</p>
               <p>"Do not speak of the past—it is all forgotten," said Clarence, pleasantly, "we
                  will be good friends hereafter, Mr. Everett, and I will do all I can to fit you
                  for the command which your father says you shall have if you do well on this
                  cruise. You are young, and have much to learn; but lessons in seamanship and
                  navigation, as well as gunnery, come easy to a willing and active mind."</p>
               <p>"I will learn as fast as I can, sir. You will find me attentive, I hope, and if I
                  am slack in anything, I will bear reproof without a murmur, and strive to improve
                  and profit by it."</p>
               <p>"Very well, Mr. Everett. Reproof will never come from my lips without cause, and
                  all that I say will be spoken in kindness. You can haul the brig up two more
                  points to the westward, as soon as that point on the bow is abeam. Keep a man in
                  the weather fore-rigging with the lead, and notice the soundings. If we get inside
                  of ten fathoms, call me instantly."</p>
               <p>"Yes sir."</p>
               <p>And the second mate continued his walk along the quarter deck, while Clarence
                  Rhett went below to make out duplicate lists of his prisoners, and to prepare for
                  their transfer.</p>

               <p>THE head-lands at the mouth of Salem harbor were visible long before night, but
                  the breeze was so light, that the Cloud-rift approached the port very slowly.</p>
               <p>Suddenly, while the sun was yet two or three hours high, the sound of a cannon
                  came booming over the water from the southward.</p>
               <p>Cromwell, who had the watch on deck now remarked to Captain Rhett, who was walking
                  with him, that most likely the <choice>

                     <corr>Chesapeake</corr>
                  </choice> was coming out. Hardly had he spoken before another loud report was
                  heard in the same direction.</p>
               <p>"A challenge, and its <choice>

                  </choice>, I'll be bound!" said Clarence, with a smile. "I hope Captain Lawrence
                  will make as short and effective work, this time, as he did with the Peacock, when
                  the Hornet was under his command. It took him but a short time to send her to the
                  bottom."</p>
               <p>The officers and crew of the Cloud-rift now listened anxiously for further sounds
                  of the expected conflict, of which they could see nothing, for <choice>
                     <sic>distanee</sic>
                     <corr>distance</corr>
                  </choice>, as well as headlands, prevented them from having a view of the offing
                  in front of Boston.</p>
               <p>In a little while two more guns were heard, shortly after these were followed by
                  rapid and heavy broadside firing. This was incessant for nearly half an hour,
                  closing just as the sun was going down; and then the dense cloud of smoke could be
                  seen, rising skyward, away off to the southward.</p>
               <p>Clarence did not know how the combat had resulted, but when he thought of the way
                  the gallant Lawrence had fought the Hornet, and the manner in which the old
                  Constitution had whipped the Java, he felt sure that victory had been with the
                  flag which he loved and carried. Little did he think, that at that very hour,
                  brave Lawrence was dying, leaving, as his heritage, the memorable words—"Don't
                  give up the ship." Though he was not destined to know it then, such was the fact;

                     <corr>Chesapeake</corr>
                  </choice>, her deck covered with the dead and dying, was in the hands of the
                  British foe.</p>
               <p>It was one of the few, but far from bloodless triumphs of their Navy during that
                  war, in which they lost their prestige, and lessened the falsity of their boast
                  that "Brittania rules the Waters."</p>
               <p>Night had already drawn its sable veil over land and sea, when the Cloud-rift ran
                  in alongside of the same wharf, to which she had been moored when Clarence Rhett
                  took command of her. And yet it seemed as if all the town had turned out to
                  welcome her back; for she had been recognised outside before dark, which was all
                  the better, for her passage by the batteries was unobstructed.</p>
               <p>The first person on board was Mr. Everett. He sprung on deck the moment the vessel
                  touched the wharf.</p>
               <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6960-00000017"/>
               <p>"What has brought you back so quick, Clarence?" he asked. "Nothing the matter with
                  the brig, I hope?"</p>
               <p>',No, sir, nothing hut good luck. We have sunk a British man-of-war schooner,
                  heavier in metal and force than ourselves, and I have come back to put her
                  officers and crew ashore. For I've neither room nor provisions to spare for
                  strangers."</p>
               <p>"Good, good, my boy, you get on gloriously. If Congress hears your deeds, and they
                  shall, they'll commission you in the regular Navy."</p>
               <p>"I do not desire the berth, sir," said Clarence. Here I am independant, with no
                  superior to order me to go or come, without consulting my own judgment. I can
                  choose my own cruising grounds, and fight in my own fashion."</p>
               <p>"Very well, my boy. Your fashion is a sorry sort of a one for the evening. And now
                  tell me how I can aid you in the disposition of your prisoners, for I suppose you
                  will want to get to sea again, before any blockaders can hunt you off from clear
                  water."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, I shall go to sea again before daylight. We must find room in the jail
                  and guard-house for these men, until you can send down to the Commanding Officer
                  at Boston, and get him to take them in charge."</p>
               <p>"Well, I will go and see to getting ready for them. While I am doing so, run up to
                  the house, and tell Nellie what I am about, and how lucky you have been. Did
                  Robert behave well in the action?"</p>
               <p>"Splendidly, sir, No one could do better."</p>
               <p>"I am glad to hear it—glad to hear that dissipation has not ruined him. I knew you
                  would make a man out of him, if there was anything left in him to work on."</p>
               <p>The old merchant now hurried away, amidst the cheers of the citizens who had
                  learned of the recent successful action of the brig, and Clarence, leaving
                  directions with Cromwell to prepare the prisoners for immediate transfer, and to
                  keep the crews on board, went on shore to take advantage of his brief leisure, and
                  exchange a word with the fair creature whose likeness was worn next his heart.</p>
               <p>He found her in the old-fashioned parlor of her father's house, her face blushed
                  with pleasure and anxiety, for good news flies fast, and she had already heard
                  what had caused the return of the Cloud-rift to port. She had heard, too, that the
                  vessel would return to sea immediately and her anxiety was caused by the fear that
                  Clarence Rhett would not take time from his duty, to come and see her before he
                  sailed.</p>
               <p>She knew his step ere she saw his form, and while a flush of joy crimsoned her
                  cheek, she sprung to meet him.</p>
               <p>"I am so glad you took time to come to see me, dear Clarence," she cried, as she
                  advanced to receive his welcome embrace. "I was so afraid you would forget poor me
                  in the excitement of your success and glory."</p>
               <p>"Forget you, with this dear memento resting on my heart!" he said, as he took out
                  her miniature, and showed it to her.</p>
               <p>"So you have been out of sight of land?" she replied, with a glad smile.</p>
               <p>"Yes, dear Nellie, and shall be again before daylight," he rejoined. "I cannot
                  stay now—not even to sit down to tell you of what has occured since we sailed for
                  I must go and see to the transfer of my prisoners. I merely came to press one fond
                  kiss upon your lips, and tell you how I thanked you for this dear gift. I gave
                  your brother permission to come ashore for an hour before we sailed, and he will
                  tell you about our action, and all that. He is a brave fellow, and I like him
                  well, now that he seems bent on reformation."</p>
               <p>"I am glad to hear praise from your lips, Captain," said the voice of Robert
                  Everett himself, for the young man had come so noiselessly in upon the happy
                  lovers, that they had not heard the sound of his footsteps. "I ran up to see
                  sister, as you said I could, but I did not mean to come so suddenly upon you, or
                  to interrupt your conversation."</p>
               <p>"The surprise is a pleasure, dear brother," said Nellie, "and I rejoice to hear
                  you spoken of so highly."</p>
               <p>"You must tell your sister all the news, I can spare no more time from duty: and
                  do not make your visit last over an hour, for we have got to beat out of the
                  harbor, and I want to be clear of the land, before daylight,' cried Clarence.</p>
               <p>Then he pressed the hand of Nellie warmly, and turned away, for he did not like to
                  make his parting more noticable in the eyes of a brother, who until lately had
                  been so seriously at enmity with him.</p>
               <p>The moment that the young Captain was gone, the manner of Robert Everett toward
                  his sister changed.</p>
               <p>"Nellie," he said in a low tone, "do you encourage that upstart in his
                  familiarity? When I came to the door, his arm was around your waist—his lips were
                  pressed to yours."</p>
               <p>"I did not know, nor did he, that one whose praise has but just left his lips, was
                  playing the spy at his heels," said Nellie, while a flush of anger darkened her
                  pretty face</p>
               <p>"When the daughter of the richest man in Salem condescends to receive a beggar for
                  a lover, it is time that her brother acted as a spy,' replied Robert Everett
                  angrily.</p>
               <p>"Clarence Rhett is not a beggar, Sir—nor was he ever one," said Nellie proudly,
                  and I will not listen to such words from your lips, while he is doing all he can
                  to lift you from dishonor. You should be thankful that he permits you to have a
                  chance to redeem yourself under his command. Go, Robert, and try to win the esteem
                  of a man as much nobler by nature than you are, as the sun is brighter and more
                  glorious than the dimmest star that floats in the sky."</p>
               <p>"I will go, Nellie Everett, but not to win his esteem. Curse him! I have always
                  hated him; but now, hate is no word for what I feel. You may think to become his
                  bride, but before that day arrives, the sharks shall feed on his body, and the
                  worms on yours. Neither he nor you shall inherit the wealth of my father. I have
                  seen the game in time, and I will cut it off, or lose my own life in the attempt.
                  Beware of me, Nellie Everett—<emph>sister</emph> I will not call you—beware of me.
                  As for your lover, he is a cold water man, and he shall have enough of it before
                  you see him again."</p>
               <p>As he hissed these words from between his livid lips, the young man turned, and
                  left his sister standing where she was when Clarence Rhett had parted from
                  her.</p>
               <p>For a few moments, she stood there silent, pale at times, and then flushed, for
                  anger and surprise were struggling with a vague fear in her mind, that her
                  brother, whose wickedness of heart she well knew, would perform some deed of
                  infamous treachery, which would indeed crush the fond hopes of herself and
                  Clarence Rhett.</p>
               <p>"He must be warned, and learn that the reformation of my brother is only a
                  sham—that he is yet a hypocrite and a villain," said Nellie, after a few moment's
                  spent in thought—"I will write to him, and send the letter on board by a servant,
                  for it would not do for me to go myself."</p>
               <p>And Nellie hastened to carry out her intention.</p>

               <p>THOUGH almost wild with anger at discovering what he had before suspected, and not
                  really known, that an attachment existed between Nellie and Clarence Rhett, Robert
                  Everett possessed sufficient prudence of character, not to act rashly. His first
                  thought was to reveal the discovery to his father, thinking that the aristocratic
                  pride of the old merchant, would cause him to revolt at the thought of a
                  connection between his daughter and Rhett; but a <choice>
                     <sic>secand</sic>
                     <corr>second</corr>
                  </choice> thought told him, that the <choice>

                     <corr>young</corr>
                  </choice> captain had lately grown so strong in the good opinion, if not even in
                  the affection, of his father, that it would be a difficult and perhaps an
                  impossible thing, to dislodge him there, So he cast aside the thought of informing
                  his father of what he had seen and heard.</p>
               <p>"I will carry out the plans which Otis, Bascomb, and Brattle propose," he
                  muttered. I will wait for a chance to put him out of the way if he does not soon
                  fall in action, and get his friend Cromwell out of the way too, and then I<pb
                     n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6960-00000018"/> will have the brig to myself. I hardly
                  think I will do as they advise, however, in making a pirate of her; not, at any
                  rate, if privateering will pay. We can be almost as lawless as a privateer, as we
                  could be as a pirate. We cannot, perhaps, be so indiscriminate, and indulge in as
                  licentious a life as they wish for, but all that will come in good time. So I must
                  yet pretend to like him, though I would gladly drink his hot heart's blood—must
                  obey his orders, and keep up the idea that I am a reformed penitent. Ha, ha! It
                  would make the Devil laugh to think of my reformation. I was foolish, though, to
                  let <emph>her</emph> know how I felt. and to make those threats to her. My anger
                  got the better of my prudence that time. She will warn him of my feelings, if she
                  can. I must prevent that. No word from her must reach him before we sail.</p>
               <p>She will hardly dare to try to see him on board, herself. If she does, I must
                  prevent it at all hazards. I will watch the house till my hour is up, and if she,
                  or a servant leaves it, I will know what to do."</p>
               <p>With this intention, Robert Everett paused when at a short distance from the
                  house, and stepping into the shadow of a large elm tree near the side walk, he
                  stood and watched his fathers door. He had stood in this position fifteen or
                  twenty minutes, when he saw some person leave the house and come down the street
                  in the direction of the place where he stood, which was on the street that led
                  down to the wharf, where the brig was moored.</p>
               <p>Standing silent and almost breathless, he watched his person as he passed him, and
                  recognized him to be one of the house servants, and saw also, that he carried a
                  note in his hand.</p>
               <p>Following the man with a steady step, he managed to cross the street unseen, and
                  to get ahead of him, the minute before he reached the brig. Facing him there, as
                  if he had come from on board, he spoke to him by name in a friendly way, and asked
                  him how they all were at home.</p>
               <p>The man did not know that the young gentleman had just been at his father's house,
                  and he replied respectfully that all were well there, and then asked for Captain
                  Rhett.</p>
               <p>"He is away just now, Oscar," said the young hypocrite "Do you wish to see him
                  particularly?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, I have a note for him, which Miss Nellie said I was to give to him in
                  his own hands."</p>
               <p>"Oh, well, <emph>I</emph> can hand it to him. We are going to shove off with the
                  brig in a few minutes, and he will come off in a boat. There is no knowing exactly
                  when he will come, or where he can be found just now. I will see that he gets the
                  note as soon as he comes on board."</p>
               <p>"I suppose it is all right, sir; but Miss Nellie told me to be particular and hand
                  it to him myself."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Yes, but you might miss seeing him after all. I will take the note, and will
                  write my sister a line, telling her it is safe, and will be delivered. That will
                  set you right with her. By the way, is the old Indian Queen tavern open yet?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, sir—they never shut up house till midnight."</p>
               <p>"Then take this silver dollar, Oscar, and spend it in good ale, or some old
                  Jamaica, to our good luck, we've had rare good fortune already, but we hope for
                  better; and when we come into port again, I may have some nice present for
                  you."</p>
               <p>Robert Everett well knew the weakness of the man, he spoke to upon the one point
                  which he touched; and as he stretched out his hand to take the silver dollar
                  offered, he handed young Everest the note which had been entrusted to him.</p>
               <p>"Wait here just a minute while I run down to my state-room to write the note to my
                  sister, and then you can go to the tavern and enjoy yourself, for it will do just
                  as well to hand her my letter in the morning as to-night," said Robert.</p>
               <p>The man waited, and Everett soon returned with a sealed note, directed to his
                  sister, which the servant took, and then hurried off to the tavern to spend his
                  unexpended bounty; for gold or silver was not a plentiful article among serving
                  men in those days.</p>
               <p>An exulting smile passed over the face of Robert Everett as the man hurried
                  off.</p>
               <p>"We will be at sea before my sister knows what has been become of the note," he
                  said in a tone of sardonic glee. "And when Clarence Rhett gets her note, he will
                  be smarter than I am It was well that I intercepted it, or his eyes would have
                  been opened, and my chances for action would have been few and far between. I hope
                  he will be back soon to get underway, for I don't want to linger in these waters
                  an hour longer. If he should by accident meet her again, my cake is all dough. If <choice>

                  </choice>, when she gets my note, she will know that her chances of ever seeing
                  him are slim enough, for she knows what I am, when once the devil in me is
                  aroused. The dollar I gave her messenger, will anchor him in the Indian Queen for
                  the next two or three hours at least, if not for the night, for he loves to crook
                  his elbow when he has the means to do it with. Ah, there comes the fellow, and my
                  father is with him, and a guard too for the prisoners."</p>
               <p>It was so. <choice>

                  </choice> Rhett and Mr. Everett, followed by a company of armed men, were coming
                  down the street.</p>
               <p>"Ah—back so soon? You did not stay your hour out," said Clarence pleasantly to the
                  second mate, as he saw him standing on the wharf.</p>
               <p>"No, sir: I thought you might be in a hurry to get away, and I only staid a little
                  while after you left," replied Everett.</p>
               <p>"It is all right," said Clarence. "We will land our prisoners immediately, and
                  then there will be nothing to detain us. I want to get to sea as soon as I
                  can.—There is bad news from Boston, if it is true. An express messenger says the
                  Chesapeake has been captured by a British privateer. I must get out before another
                  blockading fleet gets between me and the ocean."</p>
               <p>The transfer of the prisoners to the sole charge of the guard on shore took but a
                  very short time; and when it was completed, Clarence bade Mr. Everett and his
                  other friends farewell, and at once made sail on the brig, and started again for
                  blue water. At his request, there was no cheering on shore when his moorings were
                  cast off, for he wished to get to sea as quietly as he could. He had sent a
                  messenger down to prepare the guards at the batteries, so that they would not fire
                  on him by mistake; and having the ebb tide with him, and a rather stronger breeze
                  than that which was blowing when he came in, he hoped to get well off the coast
                  before daylight.</p>

               <p>"What? Robert made threats against Clarence? Why, Nellie, you must be crazy.

               <p>"Father, Robert is playing the hypocrite. He got angry with me, because he thought
                  Clarence Rhett was too friendly with me, and he uttered dark and fearful threats
                  against him. He used language which made me tremble and shudder."</p>
               <p>Surely he could not have meant it," said Mr Everett "He spoke in the most cordial

                  Robert than you think, but I know how bad he has been, and it <emph>may</emph> be,
                  that he is playing the hypocrite. I hope Clarence has got your note, for it will
                  do Robert no harm to be watched, and will be all the better for him, if scrutiny
                  finds him all correct."</p>
               <p>Mr. Everett was leaving the room when the man Oscar made his appearance at the
                  door."</p>
               <p>"His flushed face and unsteady gait told plainly that he had been drinking.</p>
               <p>Where have you been, sir," asked Mr. Everett, sternly.</p>
               <p>"On an errand for Miss Nellie, Sir," replied the man, with a very thick-tongued <choice>

                  sir."</p>
               <p>"Did you give it to him?"</p>
               <p>"No, Sir. I met Mr. Robert there. Sir, and he told me it was no use to wait for
                  Captain Rhett, Sir—that there was <choice>

                  it safe, and give it to him himself. And then he gave me a dollar, Sir, and told
                  me to go the Indian Queen, and drink his health; and I did so, Sir, and hope it's
                  no harm, Sir. Here is a note he sent to Miss Nellie, Sir."</p>
               <p>Nellie took the note, and opened it. She turned pale as she read its contents, but
                  she preserved a calm demeanor, and said to the servant:</p>
               <p>"You did wrong in not giving the note to Captain Rhett, Oscar. But it cannot be
                  helped now, you can go."</p>
               <p>The servant turned and left the room, and then she handed the open note to her
                  father.</p>
               <p>He read its contents aloud. They were brief and bitter.</p>

               <p>"The villain—the villain," muttered the old merchant, as he gazed at the
                  handwriting, only too well known to him." But he says all this to frighten you,
                  Nellie. He will not dare to attempt to <unclear>injure</unclear> Clarence. He will
                  be powerless to do it, for Clarence is supreme in command, and has a gallant crew
                  at his back. They have proved that already."</p>
               <p>"You forget, my father, that fully one half of his crew was enlisted by Robert,
                  and the most of the men that he enlisted, were his friends and associates, when he
                  was leading such a wild and reckless life, that only my tears and entreaties kept
                  you from disowning him, and driving him from your house forever."</p>
               <p>"That is so," said Mr. Everett, thoughtfully. "God help Clarence, and preserve him
                  from ill! If I only knew where to send to him, I would soon have him warned, and
                  get Robert away from the vessel. But he is off on a cruise, and there is no
                  knowing where he will first make a port. He said to me, tonight, that he should
                  first take a run up the coast, as far north as Halifax, in hopes of cutting off
                  some of the English transports, and then, either make a bold dash for the English
                  channel, or else run down to the West Indies, to cut up their merchantmen there.
                  We must pray for his safety, and wait till we hear from him."</p>
               <p>"If Robert did not mean something serious by his threats, he would not have
                  intercepted my letter, and planned to make Oscar drunk, so as to delay him in
                  giving me this note until he had sailed," said Nellie. "I shall pray for the
                  safety of Clarence; but my heart will be in constant dread till I hear from him,
                  and know that he has been warned of his danger. Robert will play the hypocrite
                  with him, disarming all suspicion in his mind, until he can complete his plans of
                  treachery, and then I fear Clarence will be defenceless to oppose them. An open
                  enemy is far less dangerous than one who lurks in ambush."</p>
               <p>"I know it, my child; and I will dispatch letters to every port, into which I
                  think Clarence may stand the least chance of entering."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, dear father—you are very kind."</p>

               <p>THE breeze freshened as the Cloud-rift drew out from the land, and when the
                  day-god once more threw his crimson smile upon her white canvass, her prow was
                  cleaving blue water, and not even from aloft could the look-out's searching eye
                  discover a vestige of the land she had so lately left.</p>
               <p>It is pleasant to a true sailor, when, glancing over his vessel, he discovers in
                  the deep azure of the waves, so darkly, deeply beautifully blue, that he is well
                  out upon the ocean's breast, and beyond the reefs and shoals, which are but too
                  well indicated by the green tint of the water ever seen on soundings; for he knows
                  that danger lies in being too near the land, instead of far away from it.</p>
               <p>So may one gaze in the deep azure of calm, confiding love and deem himself
                  blessed, far from the quicksands of green jealousy, which wreck fond hopes, and
                  rend hearts and hands, united by ties which nothing else could sever.</p>
               <p>Oh, when I look back over my own life's stormy sea, how much it seems like the
                  ocean on which I once made and found a happy, happy home. When sailing on over
                  love's fathomless waters, my sky was clear, my joy too great for utterance.</p>
               <p>But when the false compass threw me off my course, when adverse gales of fate
                  drove me into shallow water, when reefs and rocks and shoals were all around, and
                  the life-storm broke wild above and about me—then, how terribly and how desolately
                  I tossed upon the mad waters! But what has all this to do with my story?</p>

                  eastward, and the drifting seaweed, alongside, told him that he had reached the
                  gulf-stream—that mysterious river of the ocean, which, without seeming source runs
                  with its ceaseless current along our coast, kissing its coral reefs in the south,
                  but sheering off from its cold granite sides in the north, as if the ice stone was
                  beyond its power to move or melt.</p>
               <p>By noon he had gained the offing he wished, and then, with the wind still at the
                  south-west, squared away to the northward, telling his officers that he meant to
                  strike the route which English vessels would take in sailing for Saint Lawrence,
                  for he had heard from some of his late prisoners, that a large fleet of store
                  ships were known to be on their way from the old country to that point, with
                  ammunition and prisoners for the English fleets and armies, as well as soldiers to <choice>

               <p>Doctor Joshua Fowler, the Surgeon of the Cloud-rift, was the only disengaged
                  physician who could be picked up in Salem to fill that post. He not only looked as
                  if he <emph>had</emph> been "picked up," but badly put together, and worse
                  handled, before he had been <emph>gathered</emph>.</p>
               <p>He was very long, very lank, and angular all over, from his face down. His hands
                  were long and bony; on his feet, No. 13 brogans were a tight fit; his cheek-bones
                  stood out like a starred Narraganset; his nose came down in a pointed hook over
                  his thin lips, and seemed to be looking angrily at the bony chin below, as if it
                  would like to "pitch into it." His eyes were large, grey, cold, and lustreless;
                  his complexion of an ashy white; his mouth wide, and looking all the wider for the
                  thinness of his lips. Dressed in a suit of rusty black, as solemn as the best
                  ghost that ever fathered Hamlet, he looks scarcely like a thing of earth, and
                  surely not one of heaven.</p>
               <p>He did not associate much with any one, and scarcely ever spoke unless he was
                  spoken to; and then his answers were brief, as if it were a labor to open his wide
                  mouth to use his tongue, unless you got him on a story of his medical experience
                  and <emph>then</emph> he would talk.</p>
               <p>Yet he had a good deal of skill in medicine and surgery 'the result of very long
                  study and patient experiment; for, born in a physician's house, where his mother
                  had been taken to die, after receiving a fatal injury in the upsetting of a
                  stage-coach, he had been adopted and brought up by the old and childless Doctor in
                  his own ways but we are not going to give his history in these pages. We have
                  introduced him to the reader and that is sufficient for the present.</p>
               <p>He was sitting in the cabin, looking silently at the Steward, who, aided by the
                  cabin boy, was setting out the dinner-table, when Captain Rhett came below, after
                  having given the course, which the brig was to take, to the officer in charge of
                  the watch—his first mate.</p>
               <p>"Well, Doctor, we are now fairly off on our cruise, said Clarence pleasantly, as
                  he paused before the surgeon.</p>
               <p>Doctor Fowler opened his cold grey eyes wider than usual, but made no reply.</p>
               <p>"How are our wounded men getting along?" continued Clarence.</p>
               <p>"First rate!" replied the doctor in a tone as dry as dust, and almost as
                  thick.</p>
               <p>"None of them in any danger?"</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>"How soon will they all be fit for duty;"</p>
               <p>"Two of 'em in three or four days. The other six in three weeks.</p>
               <p>"I am glad to hear of it. I want every man to be fit for duty. We are bound for a
                  latitude where we may meet some rough service and where if I take prizes, I shall
                  have to spare men to take them into port. It does not pay a privateersman to
                  destroy everything that he captures.</p>
               <p>The doctor made no reply to this, but he looked wistfully at a large joint of
                  roast beef, which the Steward had just placed on the table as if he would like to
                  be engaged in dissecting it, rather than in talking, even about professional
                  matters; for like most lean men, Doctor Joshua's greatest delight was in filling
                  up his skin with such edibles as he could get hold of.</p>
               <p>"The general health of the men is good is it not?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. Some of the green un's seasick. Get over that easy—pukin's good for
                  'em."</p>
               <p>"You never were at sea before—why are you not sea-sick, doctor?"</p>
               <p>"Cause I know too much. Took a pound of epsom salts, in four doses, as soon as I
                  'greed to come. Worked off all the bile like sweat in July. Makes me as hungry as
                  a starved cat all the time."</p>
               <p>And Doctor Joshua looked ravenously at the table, upon which the steward was now
                  placing the vegetables.</p>
               <p>"I am glad to see you have an appetite, doctor. It has a healthy look," said
                  Clarence, with a smile.</p>
               <p>"Yes, healthy, but it costs a heap to board an appetite like mine. I'm ashamed of
                  myself, but I can't help it. I'd eat sole-leather, or stewed, I believe."</p>
               <p>"We'll always have something better than that," said Clarence pleasantly. "After
                  I've taken a cruise to the North, I'll run down into the latitudes of turtles, and
                  you can enjoy turtle soup and a dozen different kinds of meat from the same
                  shell."</p>
               <p>"Anything does me, if it only fills up," said the doctor.</p>
               <p>"Dinner is ready, gentleman," said the steward.</p>
               <p>"Very well," said the captain. "Call Mr. Everett, so that he can eat directly, and
                  relieve Mr. Cromwell on deck. Save a warm dinner for Mr. Cromwell. And, doctor,
                  we'll fall too, for there is not as much ceremony on ship-board as on shore."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
               <p>THREE days light but steady southerly wind took the Cloud-rift well to the
                  northward, and Clarence Rhett had a bright look-out kept from aloft and on deck,
                  day and night, for strange sails. During this time, twice each day, the crew were
                  thoroughly drilled at the guns, and in all points of offence and defence, and at
                  each successive turn of exercise, they showed marked improvement.</p>
               <p>They had just been called to quarters on the morning of the fourth day out, when
                  the look-out from the fore-top-gallant cross-trees sang out:</p>
               <p>"Sail-ho!"</p>
               <p>"Where away?" asked Captain Rhett, for he had taken charge aft, while Everett and
                  Cromwell had gone to attend to their divisions.</p>
               <p>"Dead ahead, Sir—not one only, but ten or twelve, all close together. I thought
                  'twas a pack of white clouds for a good while, but I can make out sails easy
                  enough now."</p>
               <p>"A fleet of transports under convoy, I expect," said Clarence. "If so, we must try
                  to cut some of them off.'</p>
               <p>And, taking his glass with him, he sprung into the fore-rigging, and hurried aloft
                  to a position where he could carefully examine the strangers.</p>
               <p>He was aloft for a full half hour, and twice, from that position, had the course
                  of the brig altered, and her sails trimmed to meet the alteration.</p>
               <p>When he came down, he called both Cromwell and Everett to his tide.</p>
               <p>"I have been counting the odds threatening," he said, pointing in the di-direction
                  of the strange sails. "I can count eleven sail in all—all square-rigged. They are
                  English, without doubt. Two of them only, I think, are men-of-war. One is surely
                  as large as a frigate, and she may be a three-decker. The other is a brig, I
                  think. The frigate leads the van of the fleet, and the brig watches the rear. The
                  other vessels are all clumsy in their movements, and are heavily loaded; I expect,
                  with stores, that would be of immense value to our government just at this time. I
                  have called you together, gentlemen, to reveal to you the plan that I have been
                  forming, while aloft. You know that when I captured the schooner, I also got hold
                  of her signal-book, and a list of the British cruisers on this coast. Among them,
                  is the brig Boxer, which answers to about our tonnage. I am going to disguise this
                  vessel as much as I can, and hoist the English flag, and the Boxer's number. If I
                  can manage to keep without quite closing with them before dark, I can easily cheat
                  their cruizers then, by giving them information about the English fleet, and make
                  them believe that we are the Boxer. Then we will be dull, indeed, if we can't pick
                  off one, and, perhaps even three or four of the transports, during the night. If
                  we can't cut them off from the convoy, we can board them, silence and secure the
                  crews, and scuttle <choice>

                  we will be well paid hereafter. What do you say to my plan?"</p>
               <p>"It will work!" said Cromwell quietly.</p>
               <p>"Suppose they hail you, to ask what brig, and who her commander is?" suggested
                  young Everett.</p>
               <p>"I have his name on the list—Captain Blythe."</p>
               <p>"Then, sir, I don't see why you cannot carry the game through," replied the second
                  mate. "But how will you keep from closing with them too soon."</p>
               <p>"Very easily. We must put on a<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6960-00000021"/> drag—get
                  out a hawser, with an anchor and some spare spars <choice>

                     <corr>attached</corr>
                  </choice> to it, and thus deaden our headway, while we crowd on sail as if we were
                  trying to close with them. We can thus keep out of hail till night comes on, and
                  then cut away our drag, and close when we want to."</p>
               <p>"We can do it sir—we can do it," said Cromwell, in an enthusiastic tone.</p>
               <p>"Cap'n are we goin to have another skrimmage?" asked Doctor Joshua, who had
                  approached the trio, while they were speaking.</p>
               <p>"Yes, doctor, I hope so," replied Rhett. Do you like the prospect?'</p>
               <p>"Well—yes. Only I wanted to <emph>know</emph> so as to sharpen up a bit, for some
                  of my tools are as dull as all creation. They've been used for the last two or
                  three ginerations, sartin. Old Doctor Cowslip—that was him that brought me up and
                  larned me the trade, had 'em of his boss, who fit in the French and Injun war, and
                  into the Revolution, tew; so they've seen work—all sorts of hewin', and hackin',
                  and sawin', and brobin'. I must rub the rust off on 'em, and put on a fresh
                  edge."</p>
               <p>And the Surgeon went below, but soon returned on deck with an odd looking box,
                  which he deliberately opened on the quarter deck, and taking from it the various
                  instruments, he quietly commenced cleaning and sharpening them; a proceeding that
                  produced great merriment among the most of the crew, though some of them looked
                  rather serious as they regarded the knives and saws.</p>
               <p>"Some of ye may laugh kind o' awkward and crooked mouthed, when you
                     <emph>feel</emph> 'em, instead of lookin' at 'em," growled Doctor Joshua, for
                  he did not like to have fun made of the solemnity of his profession. "It aint jest
                  like pullin' a tooth to have a leg sawed off, or a broken arm splintered up, now I
                  tell you."</p>
               <p>And he went on sharpening and cleaning with a quiet earnestness, that rather
                  cooled down the risibility of the merriest of them all.</p>
               <p>The brig had all this time been closing pretty fast with the English fleet, and
                  Clarence had the drag got ready to put on as soon as he got within long signal
                  distance, for he knew that to awaken suspicion in the men of war, would defeat his
                  plan.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
               <p>THE PLAN formed by Captain Rhett worked well. At sunset he was within about three
                  miles of the English fleet of transports, and had exchanged signals with their men
                  of war, which seemed so correct, that no suspicion of his real character had <choice>
                     <sic>disurbed</sic>
                     <corr>disturbed</corr>
                  </choice> them, or their coming. He was ordered to close and communicate with the
                  Commander of the leading ship—a heavy frigate, as soon as convenient, for she had
                  a mail for the Coast Squadron, to which His Majesty's brig Boxer belonged.</p>
               <p>This Rhett promised, by signal, to do as soon as he could, but that his brig had
                  been out so long, her bottom had got foul and it had hurt her rate of sailing.
                  This was necessary for to account for her dullness, for the Boxer was known to be
                  one of the fastest brigs in His Majesty's service.</p>
               <p>As night drew on, Rhett lessened the weight on his drag, spar by spar, and
                  gradually gained on the Englishman, until two bells—nine o'clock in the evening—he
                  passed the man of war brig just to windward.</p>
               <p>As he did so, the following conversation took place.</p>
               <p>"Is Captain Blythe still aboard the Boxer?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—I am here" replied Rhett. "Is that you, Captain Murray, on the Africa?"</p>
               <p>By reference to his list Rhett had learned that the brig, signalled as the
                     <unclear>Africa</unclear>, was commanded by the Right Honorable Captain Frank
                  Murray."</p>
               <p>"Yes," was the reply. "If the water is smoother in the morning, I'll come aboard,
                  Blythe."</p>
               <p>'Do, and dine with me. I've got some Yankee beef and mutton, and fresh codfish
                  from the British."</p>
               <p>"Good. This cursed fleet of transports ports sails so slow, that we've been out
                  till we're short of everything eatable.'</p>
               <p>"All right. I'll supply you, <choice>

                     <corr>after</corr>
                  </choice> I've spoken to the Admiral. It will take me half the night to catch him,
                  I'm afraid."</p>
               <p>"No—you slide along pretty smooth past us. You'll be up with him before midnight.
                  Keep your eye on our lights, so as not run afoul of any of these lubberly
                  transports. They're a cursed sleepy set. We have to keep wide awake, to prevent
                  them from straggling and dropping out of convoy. Are there any Yankee cruisers on
                  the coast.</p>
               <p>'No—Captain Brooks, in the Shannon, took a frigate the other day off Boston, and
                  I've heard of none since.</p>
               <p>"Good for old Brooks. He'll get promoted."</p>
               <p>"He deserves it," said Rhett. "Had a hard fight they <choice>

               <p>The brigs were now too far apart for the conversation to be kept up, though
                  speaking trumpets had been used by Rhett and the English officer.</p>
               <p>Lessening yet more weight on his drag, Rhett continued on, speaking vessel, after
                  vessel, learning their names and cargoes, and getting other information, which
                  aided him in determining what vessel to cut off, after he had spoken the Admiral;
                  for things, thus far, had worked so well, that he was <choice>
                     <sic>determiued</sic>
                     <corr>determined</corr>
                  </choice> to get possession of the important mail-bag, if he could, as he supposed
                  it contained orders to the British fleet blockading the American coast, which
                  would be of greater use in the hands of our government, than in those of the
                  British,</p>
               <p>It was nearly midnight when he got within hail of His Majesty's frigate, Hebrus,
                  and now the most dangerous part of his experiment was at hand.</p>
               <p>"Boxer ahoy!" came the hail, in a clear, commanding tone, through a trumpet
                     <unclear>from</unclear> the frigate's deck. "Come up under our lee, and shorten
                  sail. We will send a boat on board with the mail and dispatches, and receive any
                  news that you have for us."</p>
               <p>'Aye, aye, sir!" cried Rhett in reply, greatly relieved when he found that he was
                  not ordered to send a boat from his own vessel to the Englishman, for he dreaded
                  meeting some one there, who knew Captain Blythe or the other officers of the
                  Boxer, and who might detect the counterfeit he was playing."</p>
               <p>He immediately ran his vessel under the lee beam of the frigate, within a half
                  cables length, and then took in his topgallant sail, gaff topsail, flying jib, and
                  brauled up his foresail. The frigate at the same time, clewed up its course, and
                  took in topgallantsail, thus lessening her headway, so that it was easy to lower a
                  boat in the smooth sea, and send it on board.</p>
               <p>It came in a little while with a young midshipman in charge, who presented the
                  compliments of Admiral Hardy, and the mail for the coast squadron.</p>
               <p>Rhett, who assumed to be Captain Blythe, received the mail, and then gave the
                  young officer a brief account of the capture of the Chesapeake by the Shannon, and
                  a few other news items of interest. He then sent the Admiral a handsome present of
                  fresh meat and vegetables, which, he said. he had taken from the Yankees in a
                  foraging expedition.</p>
               <p>The boat did not remain long, for the convoy closed up rapidly while the frigate
                  and brig were under short canvass, and it was now necessary to make sail again to
                  hold the lead.</p>
               <p>After the boat had returned to the frigate, Rhett hailed to know if it was <choice>
                     <sic>uecessary</sic>
                     <corr>necessary</corr>

                  the Admiral, in person. "I am obliged to you for the stores you sent.—Nothing
                  could be more acceptable just now."</p>
               <p>"You are very welcome to them, sir," replied Rhett, and then he gave orders to put
                  the helm of the brig down, and bring her upon the wind, while he again made
                  sail.</p>
               <p>Luffing short across the stern of the frigate, the brig was thrown so close up
                  that her sails were shivering, and of course, she made no headway out of the line
                  of convoy. And now Clarence Rhett communicated<pb n="42-43"
                     xml:id="VAC6960-00000022"/> municated his plan for the work which he had
                  intended to do.</p>
               <p>Two boarding parties of twenty men each, were selected by the first and second
                  mates, who were to command them. They were armed with pistols and <choice>
                     <sic>cutlaasses</sic>
                     <corr>cutlasses</corr>
                  </choice>, but the orders were strict, that no pistol should be fired if it could
                  possibly be avoided, nor any loud alarm given if it could be helped.</p>
               <p>Rhett had determined to lay two of the most valuable transports aboard, as if by
                  accident, and to ship them clear of the convoy, extinguishing, their lights the
                  instant they were taken, and laying by until the fleet had run completely away
                  from them. Every man was made to comprehend the necessity of silence and prudence,
                  and the danger of discovery through any carelessness of theirs.</p>
               <p>In a little while the vessels of the convoy came straggling along, and as there
                  was not a light to be seen on board the Cloud-rift, it was easy to so steer, as to
                  get alongside of an Englishman before she was discovered.</p>
               <p>The first vessel with which she came in contact, was a large bark, which Rhett had
                  hailed as he first went along, learning that she was loaded with naval stores for
                  the Halifax depot, and had as passengers several English army officers of high
                  rank.</p>
               <p>There was a very careless watch kept on board the transport, for they did not see
                  the Cloud-rift until her hull grated against theirs. At that moment, Cromwell with
                  his party sprung on board, and in less than two minutes every man on deck was
                  secured, those below put under guard, and the bark, with her light extinguished,
                  hauled upon a wind with a course that at once took her out of the sailing
                  line.</p>
               <p>The Cloud-rift parted company with her the moment she was secure, and being now
                  to, with her foretopsail aback, she waited for the next vessel in line—a ship not
                  a quarter of a mile in the rear.</p>
               <p>The same skill was exhibited by Captain Rhett in getting his brig alongside of
                  this vessel, and the boarders got possession of her without the loss of a man, or
                  any general alarm being given.</p>
               <p>Having now two prizes, more he dared not risk taking care of. Rhett luffed his
                  brig out of the line of convoy and watched, with deep anxiety, the long line of
                  passing lights; knowing well if the vessels that he had taken were missed, it
                  would be difficult to get them out of reach of their armed protectors; but if they
                  were not missed, and the fleet kept on with the wind then blowing before daylight
                  they would be out of sight of him <choice>
                     <sic>altogother</sic>
                     <corr>altogether</corr>
                  </choice>, as he had ordered Cromwell and Everett, both, to take in all sail, as
                  soon as they got four or five miles to windward of the line of sailing kept by the
                  convoy.</p>
               <p>It was a bold act, but brilliantly successful. Clarence Rhett watched light after
                  light pass him and vanish in the distance, until, at last, not a glimmer could be
                  seen anywhere.</p>
               <p>It seemed a long night, for he could know nothing of the whereabouts of his mates
                  and their prizes, until daylight; but with his own craft laid to under only a
                  single staysail, he kept her as nearly stationary as he could, until the wished
                  for dawn had enabled him to look about him.</p>
               <p>So well had he made his calculations, and so accurately had his directions been
                  obeyed, that when morning dawned the two prizes, laying to with no canvass set,
                  were not over a mile apart and not more than two miles from him. The English fleet
                  had run entirely out of sight, not even a speck of canvass being visible from
                  aloft.</p>
               <p>Had they yet been in sight, Clarence would not have dared to show canvas on his
                  own spars, or on the prizes, for fear of their recapture; but as it was, he made
                  sail on the Cloud-rift, and running within hail of each of his prizes, he ordered
                  them to follow him under all the sail they could spread, while he bore away south,
                  determining to get his prizes into New York, if he could, by the Montauk and Long
                  Island channel, for he had little hopes of any other port being left sufficiently
                  unguarded for him to get into it.</p>
               <p>The vessels were all obliged to brace sharp up to steer the necessary course, and
                  the Cloud-rift soon proved so much faster than the prizes, that nearly half the
                  canvass which she had set, had to be taken in.</p>
               <p>Clarence cared little for this, if he could only avoid the English fleets off the
                  coast, and he kept well out of soundings, to avoid them, determining not to run in
                  until he had reached the latitude of Montauk Point.</p>
               <p>The two prizes were kept all the time close under his guns, so that no chance of
                  their re-capture, by an up-rising of the prisoners, could occur; or if the attempt
                  was made, he would be near enough to foil it.</p>
               <p>During the first day, he communicated frequently with both Cromwell and Everett;
                  telling them how to act, in case they should part company in any unexpected stress
                  of weather. When night came on, signal sights were hoisted to keep them close
                  together. All went well for the first day and night, and a fine distance way run
                  on a southerly course, toward their part of destination.</p>
               <p>But, toward the second night, the weather began to change, and Clarence saw to his
                  deep regret, that a heavy gale was evidently brewing. So far as his own vessel was
                  concerned he cared but little for it, for he knew her to be staunch and
                  well-bound, and in the best of trim. But the two transports were very deep in the
                  water, and the prize crews which he had thrown on board, though enough to manage
                  them and guard the prisoners in fair weather, would be altogether too few, he
                  feared, for both duties in a storm.</p>
               <p>As night drew on, the weather-signs grew worse and worse, and much as he hated to
                  lose one of his prizes, he felt that, to save the other, he must do it. So,
                  ordering both vessels to heave too, he took from the ship which young Everett had
                  charge of, all of her <choice>
                     <sic>orignal</sic>
                     <corr>original</corr>
                  </choice> crew and passengers, and sending the most of her prize crew to Cromwell,
                  to aid him on board the bark, he kept Robert with him. He then caused the English
                  ship to be scuttled, and when night closed, only the bark and the Cloud-rift were
                  together, for the ship had sunk within an hour from the time her crew had left
                  her.</p>
               <p>Ordering all light spars sent down on both vessels, everything housed and made
                  snug that could be, Rhett prepared for the storm which was evidently coming. The
                  worst of it was, that it seemed to be brewing in the north-east, and if it came to
                  easterly, he would have a lee-shore to clear off from, if it was of long
                  continuance.</p>
               <p>Just before it became dark, he ordered both vessels hove too under short sail,
                  with their heads to the eastward, and with lights hoisted so as not to part
                  company if it could be avoided. But Cromwell had orders, in case of separation, to
                  make the nearest safe port, and to wait until the Cloud-rift could make that, or
                  some other, where she could be heard from.</p>
               <p>Old seaman can read the weather-signs too well to be deceived; and long before
                  midnight the gale which Clarence Rhett had dreaded was upon him.</p>
               <p>He had all snug however, in his own craft, and he knew that nothing would be
                  neglected on board the prize, of which Cromwell was in charge. He kept the first
                  watch himself, and when midnight arrived, and with it the time to change the
                  watch, he had everything ready for young Everett, so that he and his watch had
                  nothing to do but to keep a bright look-out, and wait for the gale to break. For
                  when all is snug aboard a ship, and she is hove to with plenty of sea-room, there
                  is but little for her crew to do but to watch and wait, as Mr. Micawber was always
                  doing, "for something to turn up."</p>
               <p>Captain Rhett was quite weary at the end of his watch, and after turning over the
                  charge of the deck to young Everett, he was ready for a sound slumber.</p>
               <p>The second mate was well enough pleased to be delivered from the danger and
                  responsibility of his late separate command, and as soon as Clarence Rhett went
                  below, he called his familiar friends Brattle, Otis and Bascomb aft, and held a
                  conference with them. He so managed that they should not be separated from him,
                  for in them he had his chief aids and advisers in the plans of evil, which he
                  contemplated.</p>
               <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6960-00000023"/>
               <p>"We're lucky to be back on board the brig, I'm thinking;" said Bascomb, who had
                  been detailed with Everett, while the latter had charge of the ship.</p>
               <p>"Yes, indeed, to be short handed in an old merchantman, in such a gale, would be
                  no pleasant or safe thing," said Everett; "and I'm glad that cursed Cromwell' is
                  away from us. I hope he'll never outlive the gale, for I know he was a spy upon
                  all I said or did. How many of the crew, now on board, could I count for myself,
                  if I and that upstart, Rhett, got into a row?"</p>
               <p>"Full two-thirds. The captain sent almost all of them Hoogly men with the first
                  mate."</p>
               <p>"Then, if he don't keep his upper lip buttoned. he may soon find what I am made
                  of, and that there isn't quite so much milk and-water in my nature, as he seems to
                  think. I don't like these northern latitudes any too well, and would a great deal
                  rather be down on the Spanish Main, where I could see a black-eyed Senorita once
                  in a while."</p>
               <p>"So would I," said Otis, "and Bob, if you're as smart as I think you are, you'll
                  soon get us there. But, Lord, how it blows."</p>
               <p>"Yes, and we never had a better chance, if we had everything ready.—Who is at the
                  helm, I wonder? I must go and see; for if he is one of the right sort, we can let
                  the brig fall off, so as to get headway enough to leave the bark far out of sight
                  when morning breaks.—Do you stay here, boys, while I go and see about it."</p>
               <p>And the young reprobate went aft, to see what man was at the wheel.</p>
               <p>Unfortunately for his designs he found one of the old crew of the Hoogly there, a
                  true and trusty man, who told him that Captain Rhett had given orders to the man
                  he relieved, that none but the old hands were to be stationed at the wheel while
                  the gale continued. Everett dared not risk tampering with him, and he had to tell
                  his co-plotters in sin, that they must risk their chances yet awhile.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
               <p>WHEN Clarence Rhett came on deck, at four o'clock in the morning, to relieve the
                  mid watch, he found that the gale had increased to a fearful height during the
                  last four hours. There was a heavy cross-sea on, which satisfied him that he was
                  well off shore, where the gulf-current was felt by the wind. But there was nothing
                  to cause alarm. The vessel rode the waves like a duck, nothing heavier than a mass
                  of drenching spray coming on board once in a while; her spars and rigging all
                  standing taut and firm as ever. Her guns had been well secured, and though rather
                  heavy for upper-weight in such a gale, were not dangerous while no lashings
                  parted.</p>
               <p>When day threw light over the sea, Rhett looked anxiously to learn if the prize
                  was yet in sight. He soon discovered her some two and a half or three miles to
                  leeward of him. She did not appear to weather the gale, or ride the rough waves,
                  so well as the brig. She rolled heavily, and her drift was evidently more. But
                  when he hoisted his flag at sun-rise. Cromwell saw it, and answered by the
                  American flag on board the ship, and Rhett knew that all was easy as long as
                  Cromwell kept that flag, Union up, at his peak.</p>
               <p>North-east gales, as a general thing, are not very long winded. They generally
                  blow themselves out in the course of twenty-four hours, and well it is for the
                  poor mariners off our coast in the winter time, that it is so; for many of them
                  have a tough time in keeping out of the icy breakers as it is, and scarcely ever
                  does a north-easter come upon them, without some vessel getting ground up on the
                  granite rock of the coast.</p>
               <p>As the sun went up, the gale rather lessened than increased, and when moon-tide
                  came, Clarence had an excellent observation, which gave him his latitude; while a
                  change in the color and temperature of the water gave him hints, that he was
                  drifting out of the longitude of the gulf stream.</p>
               <p>This enabled him to so manœuver the brig, that she was again got within hailing
                  distance of his prize, and he learned from Cromwell, that the bark had strained a
                  good deal during the gale, and had leaked some, but he was abundantly able to keep
                  her free. Rhett directed him, if possible, to keep him close aboard until the gale
                  lulled, for he should run into New York, or some nearer port, as soon as he could.
                  He had particularly examined his Majesty's mail, and found in it documents of
                  great importance to our government.</p>
               <p>The weather kept improving as the hours flew on, and before night both vessels
                  were standing in toward the land, under short sail yet, but making good headway.
                  Night fell before land was seen, but shortly after dark, soundings were got with
                  the deep sea-lead, which told them that it was not far away.</p>
               <p>Signalling to the prize to follow in his wake, Rhett still stood in, having
                  soundings taken often, knowing from his noon latitude and subsequent course, just
                  how far he could go in with safety, before he sighted the land.</p>
               <p>His anxiety kept him on deck in spite of his fatigue, regardless of whether it was
                  his watch, or that of the second-mate, which he was keeping. This made it
                  impossible for Everett to hold his usual consultation with his treacherous
                  friends, and he had to keep himself and the vessel straight, while he had charge;
                  and when his watch was over, and he went below, he had to be equally careful, for
                  he did not know who might have keen eyes, or sharp hearing, among the cabin
                  servants, and he did not wish to be caught foul.</p>
               <p>Nothing of note occurred during the night, but the soundings gradually lessened,
                  and with the light of another morning, lumpy headlands at the upper end of Long
                  Island were in plain view; and something not quite so pleasant to see was, four
                  sail of square-rigged vessels lying at anchor, right in the channel between Long
                  Island and the Main, which, at a single glance, Clarence Rhett knew to be
                  men-of-war.</p>
               <p>As the United States Naval force was too weak to permit of its being sent to sea
                  in squadrons, the young captain at once suspected these vessels to be English, and
                  he was not long kept in any doubt about the matter. While he was yet four or five
                  miles off, they all got under way, and, showing British ensigns, stood out to
                  intercept him; and to chase, if he kept away.</p>
               <p>He soon saw that they were too heavy in build and armament for him to meet, and
                  his great anxiety was to save his prize from recapture. If that could not be done,
                  he was determined to destroy her, and to save his men from on board of her, for he
                  felt that that he could not afford to lose such a man as Cromwell, or such
                  sterling seamen as those whom he had taken from the Hoogly.</p>
               <p>As soon, therefore, as he discovered the real character of the vessels inshore of
                  him, he signalled to Cromwell to stand out to sea, under every inch of canvass
                  that he could set, while he prepared to cover his rear as well as he could, for he
                  did not mean to lose his prize, if it was even <emph>possible</emph> to save
                  her.</p>
               <p>As he was to windward when he hauled off, he had the advantage of the Englishmen,
                  whom he discovered to be all of larger size than his own vessel, two of them
                  frigates, and the others sloops-of-war, and he hoped to keep it; but the wind died
                  away very fast, and before noon, he was in almost a dead calm, the sea becoming
                  more and more calm every hour.</p>
               <p>This made his situation terribly critical, for if the calm continued. the enemy
                  could send a large force to assault him in boats, and though he might beat them
                  off from the brig, he feared the bark would not be able to withstand them, for the
                  prize-crew had so many prisoners to guard, that few men could be spared for other
                  purposes.</p>
               <p>He had shown English colors as soon as he saw the other ships, but his actions, in
                  keeping off shore, told them but too plainly his real character, and they used
                  every exertion to close with him. When the sea became smooth enough, boats were
                  got out ahead of the nearest frigate to tow her within gun shot of him, and these
                  were reinforced from the other vessels<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6960-00000024"/>
                  sels, until a long line of them were engaged in bringing the frigate up.</p>
               <p>Clarence, still keeping astern of his prize, sent every boat that he could spare
                  to tow her off shore, while in person, he trained his after gun on the British
                  boats intending to use it the moment his shot would reach them. He knew he must
                  cripple them before the frigate could bring her heavy weight of metal to bear on
                  him, or he was lost; for she would so cripple him in spars, that he could not get
                  away, and he would but fall too easy a prey to such large odds as their united
                  force would be.</p>
               <p>It was not long before the boats got within range, for the wind died entirely
                  away, and throwing off all attempt at disgrace, he hoisted the starry flag of his
                  country, and threw a warning shot at the head of the long line of boats. The
                  warning, in the shape of a round shot, troubled them a good deal, for it fell
                  nearly abreast of the leading boat, and but little wide of it.</p>
               <p>But they were not recalled, and still used every endeavor to get the frigate up,
                  where she could throw her iron into the American brig.</p>
               <p>A second shot, with better aim, tore through one of the boats, giving the others
                  plenty to do to pick up its crew, and threw the whole tow into confusion. The
                  frigate now opened fire from a brow gun, but her shot fell short of the brig, and
                  Clarence began to feel some hope of yet getting clear with his prize, when he saw
                  how much his range was superior to that of the frigate.</p>
               <p>All at once, signals were made by Cromwell from the bark that he had just
                  discovered a square-rigged ship outside of him, which looked like a man-of-war If
                  this vessel turned out to be another Englishman, Clarence felt that it would be
                  good fortune, indeed, if he was able to escape from her; and while thus perplexed
                  by the new trouble, a look out that he had sent aloft to reconnoiter <choice>
                     <sic>the the</sic>
                     <corr>the</corr>
                  </choice> outside ship, reported three more vessels away to the northwest, pretty
                  close to the land apparently standing down toward him.</p>
               <p>If he ever prayed for wind, he prayed for it then, for he saw himself nearly
                  surrounded; but he still held his sea-ward course, and getting every man on board
                  at the sweeps, endeavoured to keep the brig as well as his prize out of range of
                  the fleet astern. With his after gun, he now kept the boats of the enemy from
                  towing, for he shattered two of them by a third lucky shot, and they saw it was
                  worse than useless for them to come within his range.</p>
               <p>The vessels last discovered seemed to close most rapidly of all, for they were
                  apparently bringing a land <choice>
                     <sic>beeze</sic>
                     <corr>breeze</corr>
                  </choice> down with them. In the course of a little more than an hour, Clarence
                  could make out, through his spy-glass, that they were English—two of them
                  frigates, and the third a three-decker.</p>
               <p>He began now to despair of saving his prize, if he even saved his brig, and
                  watched, with great anxiety, the appearance of the vessel to seaward of him; for
                  if she also was English, he knew he must give up his prize, if he could, by any
                  good luck, save himself; for he had found that, deep-laden as she was, she was
                  anything but speedy in her motions.</p>
               <p>It was now getting well along in the day, and all the vessels were gradually
                  closing, when, to his great joy, the outside vessel hoisted the flag of the United
                  States, and Cromwell, who was once more within hail told him that he was sure she
                  was the frigate <hi rend="i"/>Constitution, which had already made for herself a
                  proud name in the war.</p>
               <p>Clarence now felt more hope, and urging Cromwell to do his best with his boat and
                  to wet down his canvas so as to make every sail tell, he kept his men at the
                  sweeps on board the brig, and strove to get out of range of his pursuers.</p>
               <p>It was tedious and anxious work—wearing labor for officers and crew; but he
                  cheered his men with the hope, that when darkness came, they might dodge their
                  pursuers, and he caused them to exert every nerve.</p>
               <p>So well did he manœuvre, that, at sunset, he was in hail of the constitution, and
                  got from her an officer and part of a prize crew, to put on board of the bark, so
                  that he could recall Cromwell and his best men to the brig He also delivered the
                  captured Mail-bag to Captain Brainbridge of the American frigate, who told him to
                  remain with the brig as near by him as he could, for he meant to make a running
                  fight with the English ships, and to cover the escape of the bark, if it was
                  possible.</p>
               <p>As all of the prisoners were now transferred to the frigate, and the brig clear of
                  all supernumeraries, Captain Rhett felt as if he could do his share of fighting,
                  especially with such a gallant consort in company.</p>
               <p>When the sun went down, the nearest of the English ships were only just out of
                  gun-shot, while all of them, seven in number, were not more than six or seven
                  miles away; but the American vessels now held the wind of them, for a light breeze
                  had sprung up from the east southeast, and setting every inch of canvas, with the
                  bark in tow of the frigate, they were doing the best they could to keep clear of
                  the too heavy force in their rear, or to so separate the British ships as to be
                  able to cripple in detail; if not to capture any of them.</p>
               <p>With the easterly wind, came quite a body of clouds, and Captain Brainbridge,
                  hauling up as sharp on the wind as he could, it being his best point of sailing
                  directed Captain Rhett to do the same thing, and it would be more than likely that
                  the enemy would be hull down by morning, if not out of sight should the wind
                  continue.</p>
               <p>In case they parted company, they were to try to make the port of Boston, for the
                  Constitution had just been chased from the front of Sandy Hook by a far superior
                  fleet.</p>
               <p>Captain Rhett before they parted, however, told Captain Bainbridge, that if the
                  bark could be got in without him, he would, in case of separation, and finding
                  himself alone in the morning, bear away to the southward for a cruising ground
                  more likely to be profitable to a privateer, than the one he had so far been
                  sailing on.</p>
               <p>Before midnight the Cloud-rift was out of sight and hearing of the frigate, and
                  not a sight of the English had troubled them since dark.</p>
               <p>After a consultation with Cromwell, whose experience and natural sagacity were
                  such as to be most valuable to him, Clarence concluded to have his vessel on the
                  other track, and to steer away to the southward and eastward. Therefore, first at
                  midnight the brig was hove about, and still close-hauled, with her larboard tack
                  aboard, and every bit of canvass set which would draw, she stood off on her new
                  course.</p>
               <p>Clarence did not leave the deck, though Cromwell went below, when Everett's watch
                  commenced, for the young commander knew that he was not clear of danger with no
                  barge or fleet in pursuit, it may be more than likely they would scatter when they
                  could no longer see him, so as to be more sure of having him in sight when day
                  broke again.</p>
               <p>As usual when on deck in his watch, he walked and conversed with young Everett,
                  endeavoring to make his conversation instructive as to his duties, as well as
                  cheerful and pleasant.</p>
               <p>"If the bark only gets in, your father will soon hear from us," said Clarence. "I
                  wrote a hasty note to him, and sent it on board by the last boat that went.</p>
               <p>"Did you tell him which way we would probably go now?" asked the young mate.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I told him that I should try to cut into the West India trade, and to stay
                  there as long as I could with profit and safety, and then, if my provisions
                  lasted, I would run over into the British channel, where a vessel of our class
                  would never be suspected and then return home by the northern route. A long
                  cruise, but one which we can make if we are fortunate."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir;" said Everett; "and it seems as if Fortune was smiling on us, for at
                  one time to day it looked terribly dark. But the good luck came with this breeze.
                  I don't believe a cruiser will be in sight at day break."</p>
               <p>"I hope not, if such cruisers are to be like those that pushed us so hard to day,"
                  replied Clarence. "I will go below to look at my charts a little while," he<pb
                     n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6960-00000025"/> added. "If a light should be seen, or
                  anything strange occur, send for me instantly."</p>
               <p>"I will, sir;" replied Everett, as Clarence turned and left him.</p>
               <p>When the second mate reached the forward end of the quarter-deck, he saw his trio
                  of friends awaiting an interview.</p>
               <p>"Do you think we're clear of the English man-of-war?" asked Otis.</p>
               <p>"Yes, or will be before daylight. We are bound for the West Indies, boys, and when
                  there, either the sharks, or the yellow fever has got to take care of Captain
                  Rhett, and his sense-keeper, Cromwell, or there is no hope for me; and where I've
                  no hope, you stand a poor chance, I reckon," said Bascomb." Whatever you want done
                  by us, Bob, you know we'll do."</p>
               <p>"I hope you will. One thing must be done. That Cromwell must be got out of the
                  way. He hates me, that I can see, and he has suspicion, I'm afraid, which will
                  perhaps put Rhett on the watch. As it is now, I've got <emph>him</emph> all
                  right—but the Lord only knows how long he'll stay so. I wish they were both
                  overboard. If they were, I'd show you the jolliest times you ever dreamed of."</p>
               <p>"Let another such a gale come, and they may get a sly push," said Brattle. "In the
                  dark it does'nt take a very heavy lift to send a man over to leeward, when the
                  vessel is rolling bulwalk under."</p>
               <p>"Hush—go forward—he is coming on deck again," cried the young mate.</p>

               <p>THE Cloud-rift had been absent from Salem just two weeks, when Mr. Everett. who
                  had gone down to his office, as usual, right away after breakfast, returned to the
                  house, and sent up to her room for his daughter.</p>
               <p>"You have good news for me, father!' she said the moment she looked at his smiling
                  face.</p>
               <p>"Yes, child—good news, indeed. I have just heard from the Cloud-rift. A prize from
                  her has got safe into New London under convoy of the frigate Constitution.
                  Clarence took two valuable prizes, but a blow came on, and he had to scuttle one,
                  for he could not spare crew enough to guard his prisoners, and manage her. But the

                  other prize is worth full half a million. And he rendered valuable service to the
                  government in getting a mail from the enemy, with important dispatches."</p>
               <p>"Is that all, dear father?" asked Nellie, with a quiet smile.</p>
               <p>"Yes, is it not enough? or, woman like, never satisfied, do you want something
                  more?"</p>
               <p>"Were your news bad, my father, very little would be more than <choice>

                     <corr>enough</corr>
                  </choice>; but of good news I am always greedy. Did you receive a direct report
                  from Clarence?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, a full statement. You shall read it by and by. Youngblood, my head clerk, is
                  copying it into my letter-book now. But to keep you from suffering with anxiety
                  while that is in use, here is a letter for your own important self, which may give
                  you some light upon what he has been doing with the brig."</p>
               <p>And the old merchant took a huge leather pocket-book from his coat pocket, and
                  unrolling the long strap which secured it, took out a letter directed in a plain,
                  bold hand, "Miss Nellie Everett, Salem, Mass."</p>
               <p>"Why couldn't you have said you had a letter for me. without such a long
                  rigmarole?" she asked with a pouting lip, as she snatched it from his hand, and
                  broke the seal.</p>

               <p>There were sundry changes from pale to red, and red to pale, while she read it;

                  you made ont anything new?"</p>
               <p>"Not that I know of child," replied Mr. Everett. Does he speak of Robert in his
                  letter?"</p>
               <p>"Yes sir, he says he is well, and doing well. That is all. And I know that Robert
                  is playing the hypocrite, and studying mischief to him all the time.—he must be
                  warned, indeed, he must."</p>
               <p>"He shall be child, though I think he is too smart to be <choice>

                  down into the vicinity of the West Indies, and will drop in once in a while at
                  Havana, where our letters will be most likely to reach him."</p>
               <p>"I wonder why he did not come in with his prize?"</p>
               <p>"Because he was afraid of getting into port and being blockaded there. The day he
                  wrote, he had been chased all day by a large English fleet, and only got away from
                  them by disabling the boats which were towing a frigate toward him. He was being
                  chased yet when he wrote, but he expected to dodge the enemy, as well as to part
                  company with the Constitution and his prize, that night when darkness set in, and
                  it appears that he did so. For he was not seen again after he had sent his letter
                  on board the prize, and both she and the American frigate were in sight of the
                  enemy next morning, and were chased clear into New London."</p>
               <p>"What did he say about Robert in your letter, father?" asked Nellie.</p>
               <p>"He said that he did his duty well, and was as efficient as he expected."</p>
               <p>"Not one word about receiving my warning?"</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>"That proves, father, how dangerous Robert really is. Our man Oscar gave him the
                  letter which I sent to Clarence. he has <choice>
                     <sic>opeued</sic>
                     <corr>opened</corr>
                  </choice> and read it, and, of course, withheld it. I fear, more than I can
                  express, that he will try to carry out some dark design against Clarance. Only
                  last night I had a fearful dream about him. I thought I saw him, and his hands
                  were red with blood, while a look was on his face so wild and hateful, that it
                  frightened me, and I woke up. You asked me why I was so pale and nervous at
                  breakfast this morning. I did not tell you then, but that fearful dream was the
                  cause."</p>
               <p>"Poh, my child, you must not be terrified by dreams. Such a thing might pass in an
                  ignorant old woman, who yet believes in witch-craft, reads her fortune in a tea
                  cup, and all that; but you have been too well reared to heed such folly. I saw the
                  cat up on my dressing stand, looking at herself in the mirror, this morning, but,
                  for all that, I do not expect a stranger to dine with us. You are old enough to be
                  a strong-minded woman, and not a dreamer."</p>
               <p>"I try to be womanly, father. But I cannot help distrusting and fearing Robert,
                  for I know his disposition so well, and know that his hypocrisy covers a nature as
                  dark and cruel, as it is cunning and <choice>

                     <corr>treacherous</corr>
                  </choice>. I shall write to Clarence again, and I hope you will, warning him to be
                  constantly on his guard, and to trust no one.</p>
               <p>"I will do it, Nellie. And now I must go back to the store. Have your letters for
                  the Cloud-rift ready in a day or two, for we know not how soon we may have a
                  chance to send to Havana. There is a vessel 'up' for that port, in Boston, now, I
                  believe."</p>
               <p>After these words, the old merchant kissed his daughter on the forehead, as he
                  almost always did when he went out, and then returned to his store.</p>
               <p>When she was alone, Nellie re-opened the letter which she had received from
                  Clarence, and after pressing it to her red lips, perused it again and again.</p>
               <p>"True, noble heart," she murmured.—"I feel that a terrible peril is hanging over
                  him, and I am powerless to avert it. Oh, if I had only wings, how quickly would I
                  annihilate space, and fly to his side, to be his guardian angel. Father says that
                  a vessel in Boston harbor is bound to Havana. It puts a wild, wild thought in my
                  head. God help me! I love my noble father dearly—so dearly! But I feel that I love
                  Clarence Rhett even more dearly."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
               <p>FROM the time that the Cloud-rift bore away to the southward. it seemed as if the
                  Storm-spirit, with which she had battled so often and so fiercely since her late
                  ocean-christening, had determined to pursue her no longer. On the morning after
                  the day when she had been so persistently chased by the English fleet, the sky was
                  clear, and a fresh bearing breeze enabled her to lay her course.—Only a single
                  sail was in sight from aloft, and that was so far away astern, that not even its
                  rig could be discerned by the lookout; and a half hour after it was out of sight
                  altogether.</p>
               <p>"We will soon be in a warmer latitude doctor," said Clarence Rhett to old doctor
                  Joshua, as they sat at the breakfast table that morning. "If this wind holds, I
                  shall not stir either tuck, or sheet, or brace, till we are in the route of the
                  British traders to the West Indies."</p>
               <p>"Glad to hear it," said doctor Joshua, speaking rather thickly, for he had just
                  put the half of a hot potato in his mouth. "Have some yaller fever, I hope. Never
                  seen much of it, and want to learn how it works. Got a good lot of marcury in my
                  chist, and that's <emph>pison</emph> to it, so the books say."</p>
               <p>Clarence smiled at the earnest manner in which the old doctor wished to have the
                  yellow fever on board, for him to experiment with.</p>
               <p>"I had rather keep a clean bill of health," said he to the doctor. "If we run into
                  Havana, as we probably shall, you will have plenty of opportunity to study
                  yellow-fever in the hospitals there, without a necessity for having it nearer at
                  hand. If we do get it on board, it cannot be helped, and we must do the best we
                  can with it. But a clean ship on deck and below, and a regular diet will keep our
                  men well, I hope."</p>
               <p>"If they are well all the time, and don't get knocked to pieces in no fight, I
                  shall not earn my salt," said the old doctor, with a sigh. "They don't even have
                  the tooth-ache, and I've oiled up my turnkeys a purpose for that. We've an
                  alarmin' healthy set aboard here, sir, I shall get as rusty as an old saw, if
                  somebody don't get sick. I don't see what keeps the men so well. Even the chaps
                  that were seasick, have got over pukin', and my Nux Vomica bottle aint of use no
                  longer, its terrible dull to have nothin' to do.</p>
               <p>And the doctor dashed his knife into a large slice of cold boiled pork, as if a
                  dissection of that would give him some comfort.</p>
               <p>"You have been in Havana before, I believe, Mr. Everett," said Clarence addressing
                  the second mate, who was at the table.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, three years ago, when father had the Schooner 'Frankie' in the
                  fruit-trade, I took three voyages in her. It is a gay old place, but I don't
                  understand Spanish well enough to get about on shore, to any extent; and then the
                  Diego's have an awkward way of handling their knives, when strangers are around
                  after dark, they say. Our Captain wouldn't let one of the crew stay ashore in the
                  night."</p>
               <p>"If men keep sober, and mind their own business, they are as safe in Havana as
                  they are in Boston or New York," said Clarence quietly. "I have been ashore there
                  at all hours, and never saw a sign of danger."</p>
               <p>"Has Mr. Cromwell ever been there?" asked young Everett.</p>
               <p>"I think he has. I know he was wrecked once on the Florida coast, opposite, for I
                  have heard him speak of that. He and the survivors of the crew of the ship he was
                  on, suffered terribly of thirst and hunger on a small sandy Island too far from
                  the main to reach it by swimming, and they had neither boats, nor materials for
                  rafts. When they were rescued by some wreckers, they were robbed of all they had,
                  for there was little difference, in those days, between a wrecker and a pirate;
                  and I don't know as there is even now. It's a poor trade, "which thrives by the
                  misfortunes of others."</p>
               <p>"That's so, and docterin' is one of 'em," said Doctor Joshua in his solemn way. "A
                  doctor don't have nothin to do, without somebody has the misfortin' to get sick;
                  and then if the feller that's sick, has the fortin' to die, why its all blamed to
                  the doctor. If he gits well, then it's God's blessed providence. The doctor didn't
                  have nothin' to do with it of course."</p>
               <p>"You're severe on your own profession, doctor," said Clarence, laughing.</p>
               <p>"No, cap'n it's the world that's always severe on us. Now preachers don't get
                  treated so. When they go a visitin, chickins is killed, cakes and pies made, and
                  they're stuffed till they can hardly pray. Look at their hosses. Always fat as
                  hogs in acorn-time, while a doctor's hoss looks as if he was fed on empty barrels,
                  and couldn't get rid of the hoops. Wimmen are always sweet on preachers, but
                  they're as sour as green currants on doctors. I never knew but one woman <choice>

                     <corr>on</corr>
                  </choice> this side of yearth, that ever smiled on me. Her name was Hettabel
                  Buskins, and she hated preachers awful.—But she died—she was uncommon fond of pork
                  and cabbage, and she ate too much of it one hot summer day, and topped off with
                  green cowcumbers and no salt. She took the cramps, and got all kinked up afore
                  they sent for me. When I got there, she was well nigh gone, but she ripped out one
                  back-handed blessin agin' a preacher that wanted to tell her she was a sinner, and
                  then she kicked the bucket. Afore she went, she whispered to me—'Josh, you dear
                  old dog, just you see me put deep down in the ground, so that I can't hear 'em
                  shoutin' canan over me.' I promised her, and she smiled, and went off as easy as
                  two grains of opium would let her.'</p>
               <p>The doctor sighed as he said this, and helped himself to another large slice of
                  pork, and a spoon full of mustard.</p>
               <p>"Have you never been married, doctor?" asked Clarence, who, when he had leisure,
                  liked to bring the doctor out in oddities.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Me</emph>, married cap'n? No, sir. I've had a good many misfortin's in my
                  lifetime, but never nothin' quite so bad as that. I've been upset in my gig, and
                  had my ribs broke; and when I got a pretty fair start in the wurld, arter my old
                  boss died and left me his tools, and medicines, and books, I got burnt out, and
                  didn't save nothin' but the tools, and I've got them yet. I've lost patient arter
                  patient that ought to have lived, cause I doctored 'em just as the books told me
                  to, and I've been sued twenty times, and been locked up once. But notwithstandin'
                  all these mishaps, I never had such wretched luck as to get married. Not that I
                  haven't been tempted. A widder once made a dead set at me, but I knew what 'twas
                  for. She had six little children, and scant feedin' and clothin' <unclear/> 'em,
                  and she thought I'd do for them <unclear>and</unclear> her, too, if she got me.
                  But I wasn't to be caught. No, sir, old Josh Fowler has seen too much of women and
                  their ailins', to get fooled by 'em, I never knowed one yet that wasn't
                  histerricky. If they wasn't narvous, they'd have tempers that would shake the
                  vanes of an elephant. No, sir, I never was married, nor never will be with my own
                  free will and consent. Men that don't know how wimmen is made, and what their

               <p>And the doctor swallowed a cup of coffee, with a more pleasant face than he had
                  before shown that morning.</p>
               <p>By this time, Clarence and Everett had finished their meal, and as the latter had
                  to relieve Cromwell in his watch above, they both went on deck.</p>

                  </choice> she is a beauty, that Brigantina Americano!"</p>
               <p>These words of admiration were uttered by one of three Spaniards, who stood upon
                  the mole at Havana. as the Cloud-rift, under her topsail, mainsail and jib, came
                  sweeping into the harbor, from a gale, which, to use an old phrase, was blowing
                  'great guns' outside.</p>
               <p>The speaker looked like a sea going man. His dark complexion had a weather bronzed
                  appearance, and his dress was rather more nautical than civilian in its fashion.
                  He was a middle aged man, short and muscular in build, with a rough and reckless
                  expression of face.</p>
               <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6960-00000027"/>
               <p>One of his companions was quite an elderly man, dressed in the most elegant and
                  fashionable style, with a great display of jewelry on his person, such as diamond
                  studs in his shirt bosom, rings on his fingers and a huge chain of gold across his
                  vest, as a guard to his watch.</p>
               <p>The other was quite young—a mere boy, one would say, at a first view of his lithe
                  and slender form, and his smooth face. But a glance at the sternly contracted
                  brow, the thin, firm lip, the cold and haughty expression of his face would
                  satisfy a keen observer, that though young, perhaps, in years, he was possessed of
                  a character, which even age does not always give to men.</p>
               <p>"She is pretty, and looks as if she would outsail the wind," said the oldest of
                  the three. "What do you think of her, Don Francisco?" he added, addressing the
                  enquiry to the youngest of the party.</p>
               <p>"I think she would suit our business to a miracle," replied the young man, keeping
                  his eye upon her, as she slipped swiftly along up the harbor. "Aye, Senor De Leon,
                  if she was mine, with a good crew to man and fight her, I'd shake my finger in
                  scorn at the miserable men-of-war's-men, who think they can crush the Free Rovers
                  of the Sea. What say you to it, Captain Martinez?"</p>
               <p>And the young man now turned to the short-statured man, who had uttered the first
                  exclamation.</p>
               <p>"I think that if money can buy her, or, that failing, if cunning or force can get
                  possession of her, our flag will float at her peak before two weeks have come and
                  gone," replied Martinez. "I never have seen a vessel run at the rate of ten knots
                  up this harbor under three sails before. She lays so low in the water, that if her
                  spars were scraped and her hull painted lead color, you couldn't see her five
                  miles off at sea, with no canvas set. We must have her, for since the Government
                  have got the Santa Isabella, and the Maraquita on our cruising ground, we have
                  nothing fast enough to keep out of their way. With her under our feet, we could
                  fight, or run away just when we chose. What think you, Senor De Leon?"</p>
               <p>"That I have got two or three chests of doubloons to lend you, Captain Martinez,
                  if you can buy her. If not, you have men who can use steel, where gold will not
                  avail, and few men are your superiors in cunning—in courage, none."</p>
               <p>"She shall be ours," said Martinez. "She is strong handed too. See, all of her
                  canvas comes in at once, and quickly too, as she rounds to at the anchorage
                  yonder. There goes her anchor down, and the men are aloft furling sail already.
                  They work well. The man who commands there, knows what he is about. The cursed
                     <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Inglaterras</foreign> (Englishmen) will be thankful to
                  us, if we rid them of such an enemy. I will do it, but for no love of them. We
                  need such a craft, and must have her."</p>
               <p>"How will you go to work, Captain?" asked the youngest man.</p>
               <p>"I will get you help, Don Francisco," said Martinez. "You must put on your naval
                  uniform, and visit her as soon as you can, offering her commander and officers our
                  joint hospitalities. Senor De Leon will, I know, throw his princely palace open to
                  them as guests, when, in the end, there will be a chance to get so rich a reward
                  for the hospitality."</p>
               <p>"To be sure I will," replied Senor De Leon. "Invite them one and all to my palace,
                  and wine and beauty shall welcome them there. If it does not take their wits away,
                  it shall be no fault of mine."</p>
               <p>"Get the officers once on shore, and make yourself acquainted with the strength of
                  the crew, and the manner of watch kept, and if we cannot buy, we can capture,"
                  said Martinez.</p>
               <p>"Well, Captain, ashore they shall come, if my smooth tongue can win them there,"
                  said Don Francisco, with a quiet smile.</p>
               <p>"Your smooth tongue would win a priest from his beads, or a woman from her love,"
                  said Senor De Leon. "It is a pity you were not a woman, with your winning ways,
                  Don Francisco."</p>
               <p>"A woman, with a woman's heart, and a heart's weakness? I'd cut my throat if I
                  was, for you know, Senor, how I despise weakness in any thing, human or animal.
                  I'd kill my pet blood-hound, if I thought there was a drop of merciful blood in
                  his veins."</p>
               <p>And a look of almost fiendish bitterness made the face of the young man look
                  Satanic, beautiful as it was in every feature.</p>
               <p>"No one who has ever had dealings with Don Francisco when his claws are cut, will
                  accuse him of any weakness at heart," said Captain Martinez. But he can be as
                  pleasant as a tiger enjoying a siesta, when he chooses to keep his claws out of
                  sight. And now, Don Francisco, when will you go on board of the stranger?"</p>
               <p>"Right away, Captain, as soon as I can go to my room, and put on my uniform. I
                  shall make no delay, for I long to be on blue water, under the black flag, once
                  more. I'm sick of playing the idler here, when there is so much to do afloat; and
                  I'm sure you are, too, my brave Captain."</p>
               <p>"You are right, Don Francisco; and our men are getting uneasy, for steel hangs
                  heavy in the scabbard, which is light to the hand," replied Martinez.</p>
               <p>"Well, arrange matters to suit yourselves, comrades. I will be at the palace,
                  ready to do the honors when the guests arrive. Let them be but the geese which
                  will lay golden eggs by and by, and I care not what it now costs to feed them. I
                  have rare wines, music, women, everything, to charm and to ensnare, and they are
                  at your service in the cause of our brotherhood."</p>
               <p>"We know it, Senor, and now I will hasten on my mission," said the youngest of the
                  three; and he turned away, and walked rapidly up the street toward the Plaza.</p>
               <p>The other two went in the same direction, but more leisurely.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
               <p>SCARCELY had the anchor of the Cloud-rift settled and taken ground, and her sails
                  been furled, when Clarence Rhett, with the impatience of his ardent nature, had a
                  boat lowered, and he hurried on shore to visit the United States Consulate, to see
                  if letters had not arrived from Salem. His cruise had occupied several weeks since
                  he had sent in letters by his English prize bark, and he felt sure that neither
                  Mr. Everett, or Nellie, would neglect any opportunity of sending to the point,
                  where he had informed them there was the most likelihood of his being able to
                  receive letters.</p>
               <p>But he was doomed to disappointment. The consul looked over all the letters in his
                  office, and there was none for Captain Clarence Rhett, or any one else on board
                  the Cloud-rift. There had been no late arrivals from any Massachusetts port,
                  though two or three vessels were expected to arrive from Boston, and were looked
                  for every hour.</p>
               <p>Clarence was sadly disappointed, but he bore it quietly, and at once asked the aid
                  of the consul in introducing him to the proper Spanish officials, so as to enable
                  him to procure wood, water and provisions for his vessel, upon payment for them.
                  The consul informed him, that he would find no difficulty in getting all that be
                  required, for the hatred the Spaniards held toward the English was such, that they
                  would do anything in their power to aid their enemies. Never before had the flag
                  of the United States been more in favor with the Spanish authorities, than it was
                  then, for the news of several of our late naval victories had reached them, and
                  they were rejoiced to see a young republic snubbing that monarchy upon the ocean,
                  whose boast it was that she ruled the waves.</p>
               <p>The consul agreed to call with him after the usual salute had been fired in honor
                  of the Governor and port, upon the Governor, and solicit the necessary permission;
                  and invited him also, whenever he came on shore, to make his home at his
                  house.</p>
               <p>These matters all pleasantly arranged, Clarence Rhett returned to his vessel, and
                  hoistening the Spanish flag forward,<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6960-00000028"/>
                  fired a national salute of twenty-one guns.</p>
               <p>The echo of his last gun had hardly ceased reverberating over the beautiful
                  harbor, before the American flag was seen floating from the fore-truck of the
                  Spanish Admiral's ship, a noble three-decker, anchored off the arsenal yard, and
                  the salute was answered, gun for gun.</p>
               <p>Clarence, now neatly dressed in uniform not unlike that of the naval officers of
                  his country, and accompanied by Cromwell, again took boat, and paid an official
                  visit to the Admiral, by whom he was received in the most cordial, yet dignified
                  manner; for a true Spaniard is as stately in his friendship, as in his
                  enmity—courtly always.</p>
               <p>Young Everett was left in charge of the Cloud-rift during the absence of the
                  Captain and first mate, having directions to snug up on deck and aloft, and to put
                  the vessel in complete order. None of the crew were to go on shore until further
                  orders, nor were any shore-boat, except those containing officers in the Spanish
                  service, to be yet allowed alongside.</p>
               <p>Clarence had been gone but a few moments on his visit to the Admiral, when a boat,
                  manned by a full crew of uniformed seamen, and pulled with the beautiful precision
                  always seen in men-of-war boats, was seen approaching. A young officer, in a rich
                  naval uniform, sat in the stern sheets, and the moment that he was alongside, he
                  ascended the companion ladder, leaving the crew in the boat.</p>
               <p>The officer was met at the gangway by young Everett with a low bow.</p>
               <p>"Do I address the commander of this beautiful vessel?" asked the young Spaniard,
                  speaking in excellent English.</p>
               <p>"No, sir, I am her second officer. The Captain and first officer are both away.
                  Will you walk into the cabin, and await their return?"</p>
               <p>Everett lifted his cap while he replied to the Spanish officer.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, sir," responded the latter "I am lieutenant Francisco, aid to Captain
                  Martinez, of the Navy of Spain, and nephew to the Conde de Leon with whom we both
                  are spending a brief leave of absence. We were down at the Mole when your vessel
                  came in from sea, and my uncle would give me no rest until I agreed to call on
                  your captain, and invite him and his officers to visit my uncle and Captain
                  Martinez at the palace De Leon on the Sierra, just outside the city walls. I will
                  wait and see your captain for my uncle would be angry if I did not deliver his
                  invitation in person; and I would like in the meantime, to look over your vessel,
                  for I am sure I never saw anything so beautiful afloat."</p>
               <p>Young Everett was delighted to show such a distinguished looking young officer
                  around, and there was nothing of the vessel below, on deck, or aloft, that he did
                  not exhibit and <choice>

                  especially examined and commended by the Spaniard, who made the most minute
                  inquiries as to the number of the crew, how they were divided in watches, and what
                  were the rules of duty at sea and in port. This did not seem strange to Everett,
                  coming from one who seemed to wish to compare the rules of his own service with
                  ours, and he responded to each question freely and fully.</p>
               <p>Lieutenant Francis had been on board full <choice>

                  visit to the Admiral who had tendered them every service in his power.</p>
               <p>Everett introduced the young Spaniard to his captain, and Lieutenant Francisco,
                  after a few words of enthusiastic praise of the vessel, delivered the pressing
                  invitation sent by his uncle, the Conde de Leon, who was only too happy, he said,
                  in placing his entire palace at their disposal while the brig remained in
                  port.</p>
               <p>Clarence could not but be pleased with this kindness from a wealthy Spanish
                  nobleman, and he promised in the name of his officers as well as for himself, to
                  visit the Conde and Captain Martinez, as early as duty would permit. He was
                  waiting, he said, for letters from home, and while he was making some repairs to
                  the brig, and refilling her wood-lockers and water-casks, he would spend as much
                  time on shore as he could.</p>
               <p>The Spanish officer expressed great satisfaction at this, and then asked, in the
                  name of his uncle, permission to send on board a quantity of fresh provisions and
                  fruit, from the plantation of the Conde, as a present to the crew.</p>
               <p>This generous offer of articles, so grateful to men who had been quite a long time
                  on sea-diet, could not be refused, and Captain Rhett accepted the proposition very
                  thankfully.</p>
               <p>Lieutenant Francisco now left in the same handsome style in which he came on
                  board, leaving Captain Rhett and his officers quite delighted with their visitor
                  and the princely hospitality so nobly tendered to them.</p>
               <p>"It seems as if these Habaneros could not do enough for us, now that we are at war
                  with their old enemy and conqueror," said Clarence, with a laugh. "Well, it is
                  better to have friends in these latitudes, than enemies, and this will make a fine
                  port for us to run prizes into, when we cannot easily get them North.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
               <p>AFTER reaching shore, and sending his boats crew to their quarters, Don Francisco
                  took a valante, which was in waiting for him near the landing, and ordered the
                  driver to take him to the Pallazo De Leon as fast as his horse could go.</p>
               <p>The calasero obeyed, and within a half hour the vehicle, rattling over the streets
                  of the Serra, and in through the arched gateway of a magnificent palace there,
                  halted at its marble front, and Don Francisco hurried in to meet Captain Martinez,
                  and the one of whom he had spoken as a Conde though he now, as formerly, only
                  addressed him as <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Senor</foreign> De Leon.</p>
               <p>"Well, Don Francisco, what fortune?" asked De Leon, as the young man entered the
                  splendidly furnished room, where he and Captain Martinez were seated.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Good</emph>
                  <choice>
                     <sic>fortnne</sic>
                     <corr>fortune</corr>
                  </choice>, Senor," replied the young Spaniard. "When I got on board the brig, I
                  met the second officer only, a young fool, whom a few flattering words won over in
                  a moment to do all I wished him to. I know everything about the vessel, her
                  armament, great and small, the number of her crew, how they keep watch. all in
                  fact, that I care to know, and even more. I was an hour engaged in pumping him,
                  and feeding his fancy on the sights and enjoyments before him when he could come
                  ashore, before the captain and first officer got back."</p>
               <p>"I then extended the invitation of my <emph>uncle,</emph> the <emph>Conde</emph>
                  De Leon, to the American captain, who is young in years, but has an old and a wise
                  head for all that.—He will visit you, but you must be as weary in your advances
                  toward getting possession of his vessel, as you would be in your approaches to the
                  beautiful wife of a jealous man. I rather over-ran your directions, Senor, but I
                  thought our treasury could afford it, when I considered the stake we are to play
                  for. I tendered a present of fruit and fresh meat to the crew of the vessel in
                  your name."</p>
               <p>"You were right,' replied De Leon. "And they shall have a princely present Is the
                  vessel really as fast as she looked to be?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Senor. Her captain says that, so far, he has run <emph>five</emph> knots to
                  any <emph>three</emph> of the fastest vessels he has sailed with. He has been
                  chased by British fleets in heavy weather, and with light wind, and escaped
                  without any difficulty—once when almost surrounded before he was aware of it."</p>
               <p>"How is she found in arms?" asked Captain Martiney.</p>
               <p>"She could, not be better found. She has a battery of three long pivot guns, a
                  full set of guns, pistols, cutlasses and pikes, for all of her crew, and a large
                  store of ammunition. She lacks for nothing, below or aloft. Everything, too, is in
                  first rate order. With her under our feet, we can defy all the navies afloat, go
                  where and when we please, and reap a harvest of gold, such as was never seen
                  before by rovers of the sea. I was in love with the Fairy-craft when I saw her
                  glide up the harbor; but it almost maddened me when I stood on her deck, and
                     found<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6960-00000029"/> how perfect she was. She must
                  and shall be ours. If her Captain cannot be dealt with, gold and pleasure will do
                  anything with the young fool of a second mate. I sounded him, and got his depth to
                  an inch. The other officer is a quiet man, and I couldn't make much out of
                  him."</p>
               <p>"When will we receive a visit from the American?" asked De Leon.</p>
               <p>"Not to-morrow, for he is to visit the Governer then; but probably the day
                  after."</p>
               <p>"All right. That will give time to arrange everything in a style of magnificence,
                  that will astonish them."</p>

               <p>"WELL, doctor, we are in Havana at last," said Captain Rhett to Doctor Joshua just
                  after his visitor, Lieutenant Francisco, had left, and all of the after officers,
                  of the brig had sat down to dinner, for in port, Captain Rhett made it a rule to
                  allow the Boatswain, Carpenter, and Gunner to take charge of deck watches, so as
                  to relieve the mates, who had enough to perform in watch on and watch off at
                  sea.</p>
               <p>"Yes sir, and an awful nice place it is, I expect, Must be sickly, too; the houses
                  seem so crowded together, that there's no chance for fresh air to sweep among 'em.
                  It must be a wonderful nice place for docterin'," replied the old man.</p>
               <p>"It is, in the fever season,' said Clarence smiling. "How do you propose to amuse
                  yourself while we are here, doctor? We shall stay in port a week or more.'</p>
               <p>"I'm going to them yaller fever hospitals you told me about to see how creeturs
                  die when they get it," replied the doctor; and I'd like to go to them bull fights,
                  that I've heard tell of. They say four or five fellers get hooked an ripped up at
                  almost every one of em and I'd like to see some of that practice."</p>
               <p>"Well, doctor, you will have plenty of time for all that. We are also invited to a
                  dinner with the admiral of the port, and to a grand Banquet at a rich Court
                  outside of the city. You will go with us there, will you not?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir I s'pose so. It runs agin my grain to back out from fodder, and these
                  big bugs set tip top tables I've heard."</p>
               <p>"You will find no lack of delicacies where we go, doctor. But I warn you, when we
                  get ashore we shall meet with some of the handsomest women in the world, You must
                  take care of your heart, doctor."</p>
               <p>"Women are pison to me and I can't endure 'em—handsome or ugly, they're all one to
                  me. I'd rather see one good case of yaller fever than a ship load of gals any
                  time," replied the doctor, his face expressing his disgust of the subject brought
                  up.</p>
               <p>"You are incorrigible, doctor" said Clarence with a laugh. "But I know your time
                  will come—a pair of bright eyes well melt the ice of your nature before long. See
                  if I am not a prophet."</p>
               <p>"I don't think the day will ever come,' said the doctor nervously; "but if it
                  does, I have an antidote to the evil. I always carry a bottle of prussic acid in
                  my pocket."</p>
               <p>"And would poison yourself before you would yield to love?" said Robert
                  Everett.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and the Lord have mercy on my soul," said the doctor, earnestly. "I know
                  'twould be sinful to commit suicide, but when a poor weak creetur, like me, gets
                  into deeper trouble than he can bear, what else can he do?"</p>
               <p>"I d endure matrimony like a martyr," said Cromwell, smiling. "But I m like the
                  doctor, rather offish, when women are around; so there s no danger of my
                  double-teaming in this world. If I did, I'm sure I shouldn't take a Spanish wife,
                  for they're as jealous as they are loving, and carry a dagger as often as they do
                  a pair of scissors. If the doctor wants proof of that, he can see dozens of dead
                  men ashore here any morning, with daggers stuck into 'em."</p>
               <p>"Can I?" said the doctor. "Then I'm goin' ashore every mornin' we're here. Stab
                  wounds is a study I haint had much of, and I'd kinder like to look into it. It's
                  amazin' to man, what a heap of new things a creetur can larn that travels. When I
                  git back to Salem, I'll put '<hi rend="i"/>Surgerin' Doctor,' onto my shingle, and
                  cut a bigger swell than any of them other pill-makers."</p>
               <p>And the doctor actually laid down his knife and fork, so wrapped was he in the
                  thought of what he would be when he got back to Salem.</p>
               <p>"What duty will be on hand this afternoon, Captain?" asked Cromwell.</p>
               <p>"Nothing but to let the men trim ship as neatly as they can. Then let them rest
                  till to-morrow. I shall let one half of the crew have liberty from sun-rise to
                  sun-set to-morrow, and the other half the same time the next day. If we stay over
                  a week, they shall have another chance ashore. The half of the crew who remain on
                  board, will break out the hold, and clean the water casks, ready to fill when the
                  tank comes alongside. The Admiral is going to send a Government tank from the Navy
                  Yard. He will also send wood-boats off to us in a day or two."</p>
               <p>"Very well, sir, all shall be ready to receive them."</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
               <p>THE second day the Cloud-rift lay in port, was a busy one for Clarence Rhett and
                  his first officer. Everett and the doctor had been allowed leave of absence early
                  in the morning and had gone on shore to see the sights. But Cromwell, with one
                  half the crew, was engaged in breaking out the hold, and getting ready to take in
                  provisions and water, and Clarence was on shore, engaged with the Consul in
                  visiting Government officials, and in calling upon merchants to purchase necessary
                  stores.</p>
               <p>The young Captain found warm sympathy for the American cause general among the
                  Spanish officers and civilians; therefore there were no business difficulties in
                  his way.</p>
               <p>We stated that young Everett and the doctor had gone on shore together. They did
                  not remain long in company, for the doctor did not care to see anything but the
                  hospitals, and finding a person who spoke English and knew their localities, he
                  engaged him to take him there. But Everett had been playing the part of a
                  temperance man so long, that he wanted to get into the saloons, where something
                  more exhilarating than water was to be found, and he quickly broke off from the
                  doctor, and took his own route.</p>
               <p>He soon found his way to the "Longa," which from the earliest history of the
                  island, has kept up its name and fame as a fashionable, first-class wine and
                  liquor room. Here, seated at one of the little marble-topped tables, with a glass
                  of iced orgeat and brandy before him, and a choice cigar in his hand, he gazed
                  around at the immense crowd of people, coming and going, smoking and drinking, all
                  seeming to be in the quiet pursuit and enjoyment, too, of comfort close akin to
                  happiness.</p>
               <p>Suddenly a hand, cased in a delicate kid glove, was extended to him, and a
                  cheerful voice cried out:</p>
               <p>"Good morning, Senor Americano. You are early on shore to-day."</p>
               <p>Everett started, for the person who came up and spoke, had advanced from the rear
                  of the place where he was seated, and at the first instant he did not recollect
                  him. But upon looking a second time at the rather handsome, though haughty face,
                  he remembered his visitor of the day before, Lieutenant Francisco.</p>
               <p>"I am glad to see you, lieutenant," said he, for I am quite lost on shore here. I
                  do not speak the language, and, of course, do not know where to go to find
                  amusement."</p>
               <p>"I am glad that I met you, then," said the Spaniard. "For I am completely
                  disengaged this morning and have nothing to do. But do not remain here, where
                  people of all castes congregate.—Come with me to a more select establishment,
                  where over a cheerful bottle of vino puro de Xeres, I will endeavor to give you
                  some insight of Havana life."</p>
               <p>Robert Everett was but too glad to accept<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6960-00000030"/>
                  cept the offer of the condescending Spaniard, and rising, he accompanied him to a
                  house in the Calle del Rey, of quite unpretending outward appearance, but inside,
                  splendid beyond any ideas of splendor that Everett had even before formed, both in
                  furniture and decorations.</p>
               <p>The young Spaniard who seemed to be particularly at home in the place, told
                  Everett that it was a kind of club house resorted to only by an exclusive set of
                  aristocratic and wealthy Cubans, who could afford to pay roundly for their
                  pleasures</p>
               <p>Ushered by an obsequious servant into a large room, furnished in the most costly
                  manner, the two young men took seats, and the servant immediately disappeared.</p>
               <p>"There is a pleasant peculiarity about this house," said Don Francisco. "You are
                  never intruded upon by servants with prying eyes and garrulous tongues.—Upon that
                  marble table you observe three bells. I will ring the first, and immediately wine
                  of the choicest brands will be brought in. They know my taste, and I hope you will
                  approve it."</p>
               <p>And the young Spaniard rung the smallest of the three bells.</p>
               <p>In an instant, as if by magic, a part of the floor rose, and a table came up
                  through the aperture, on which stood some bottles of choice wine already opened,
                  glasses and ice, all upon a salver of chased silver.</p>
               <p>"It is about my lunch time," said the young Spaniard, and he rung a second
                  bell.</p>
               <p>Another table come up in the same way as the first, upon which salads, plates of
                  cold game, sandwiches, etc., etc., were plentifully distributed.</p>
               <p>This seems indeed magical," said Everett, looking in surprise at the elegance of
                  the lunch, the massive plate upon which it was served, etc.</p>
               <p>"Oh, you will not know the full force of my magic power until I ring the third
                  bell," said Don Francisco, smiling. "But I will defer that until we have done
                  justice to the wines and eatables. There is no magic in them, but a reality, which
                  I hope you will enjoy."</p>
               <p>And drawing chairs to the lunch-table, and filling a glass for his companion and
                  himself of the sparkling Vintago of Xeres, the young officer urged Everett to fall
                  too without further ceremony.</p>
               <p>There is nothing that sooner places two comparative strangers upon terms of
                  intimacy than eating and drinking together. And in a little while, over the mellow
                  wine and the delicious food, the two young men grew as chatty and communicative as
                  if they had known each other for ages.</p>
               <p>Everett told the young officer that he did not follow the sea for a living, or as
                  a profession, but to please his father, who was one of the wealthiest merchants in
                  Massachusetts. He also revealed his dislike of Captain Rhett, begging the young
                  Spaniard, however, never to let the latter know of it. He gave, as his reason, the
                  fact that he had an only sister, lovely as an angel, whom young Rhett was trying
                  to entrap into matrimony, and he denounced him as an upstart, rising from beggary
                  upon the charity and favor of his father.</p>
               <p>All of this confidence suited Don Francisco hugely, and he on his part, with equal
                     <emph>apparent</emph> candor, told Robert Everett that he was the nephew and
                  sole heir of the Conde De Leon, whose wealth was immense—almost beyond
                  computation. That he had entered the Spanish Navy more for pastime than anything
                  else, and had influence which would keep him on shore when he wanted to be there,
                  or put him on duty afloat when he so desired. As to money—his uncle gave him all
                  that he could spend, and pressed more upon him than he knew what to do with.</p>
               <p>All of this was sucked in by young Everett with a degree of credibility, that
                  pleased, even more than it surprised, the Spaniard, for he discovered by it, that
                  he would find a pliant tool in the young American to aid in carrying out any, and
                  all plans, which he and his confederates might form.</p>
               <p>One, two, and even a third bottle disappeared, of the light, but brilliant wine,
                  and the young American began to feel as if he was breathing the air of Paradise.
                  He never had enjoyed himself half so well before, he said.</p>
               <p>"Then it is time for me to ring the third bell," said the Spaniard, with a gay
                  smile, "and to see if my magic power does not bring yet more enchanting pleasures
                  before us."</p>
               <p>As he rung the bell, the tables sunk away and disappeared, and in their place
                  arose vases of flowers of the most beautiful hues, fragrant, also, to an
                  extraordinary degree. Then a sound of distant music, a low, but beautiful quick
                  march, growing louder and louder each instant, fell upon the ears of the
                  astonished young man. While he listened in speechless rapture, it changed into a
                  galopade, and a door opened at the further end of the room, admitting a troup of
                  beautiful young girls, in the scanty and transparent costume of ballet dancers,
                  who, as the music changed into a voluptuous waltz, circled around and around the
                  room iu the most bewildering and be witching attitudes that ever the eye of man
                  gazed upon.</p>
               <p>The music, proceeding from some unseen source, grew wilder and louder, and the
                  feet and limbs of the beautiful girls flew faster and faster, till young Everett
                  almost fancied the room filled with flying angels. Dark eyes, swimming with tender
                  light, were glancing upon him. He could catch glances of swelling bosoms, of
                  rounded limbs, of white and tapering arms, and beckoning hands; and he actually
                  closed his eyes in mere bewilderment, so enchanting did it all seem.</p>
               <p>Young Francisco rung the third bell again, and the dancers vanished through the
                  door by which they came, and in a moment all was as still again in the room as if
                  it was tenantless.</p>
               <p>"This is not real—I must be in a dream," murmured Everett, in a low tone, for he
                  almost feared to speak loud in that enchanted room.</p>
               <p>'Hush—a great treat is yet to come. La Bella Carolina, the Queen of Song, will
                  make you dream of Heaven, my friend," said Don Francisco in a low tone</p>
               <p>And as he spoke, the door opened again, and a tall woman, of such ravishing beauty
                  that Everett could not take his eyes from her, came forward with a slow and
                  gliding step, seeming to move as if on air, for no sound save the rustling of her
                  dress could be heard,</p>
               <p>In her white hands she held a guitar, beautifully ornamented with gold and jewels,
                  and pausing near the vases of flowers, she touched the strings of the instrument,
                  and, to its sweet accompaniment, sang with a voice softer, sweeter than anything
                  the American had ever dreamed of. Her voice was like a flute, and though she sung
                  in Spanish, such was the expression of her lovely face, such the thrilling melody
                  of her notes, that Everett seemed to understand the burden of her theme.</p>
               <p>First, it was bold and warlike, and he felt as he gazed upon her flushed face, her
                  wild and flashing eyes, and heard her loud and thrilling notes, as if he could
                  dash forward singly against a thousand men in arms.</p>
               <p>Then both voice and expression changed. Her dark eyes seemed to melt into liquid
                  tenderness—her voice was low and trembling and it seemed to sigh out a gushing
                  fountain of love. It was all harmony, that filled his ears and entranced his
                  senses.</p>
               <p>Again there was a change. A look of unutterable sadness <choice>
                     <sic>eame</sic>
                     <corr>came</corr>
                  </choice> over her face, her eyes were down-cast, and tears seemed to come
                  freezingly out from beneath her long fringing lashes, while a low, wailing voice
                  broke out in words so full of despair, so utterly sad, that Everett, before he
                  knew what he was about, bowed his head upon his hands and wept.</p>
               <p>Suddenly the music ceased. He raised his head; the vision had vanished, the singer
                  was gone, and only Don Francisco was there, in the same seat, looking at him with
                  a pleasant smile.</p>
               <p>"What do you think of La Bella Carolina?" asked the Spaniard, quietly. 'Her songs
                  seemed to affect you wonderfully.'</p>
               <p>"She is not human—she is an angel," said Everett, wild with his enthusiastic
                  admiration.</p>
               <p>"A fallen angel, I fear." said Don Francisco, with a laugh." But it would not do
                  for her to hear me say so, or I might get a stiletto between my shoulders. She is
                  quite angelic where she<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6960-00000031"/> loves, but a
                  fiend incarnate where she hates. If you desire it, you shall be introduced to her,
                  or to any of the pretty dancing girls, who were around us but a little while ago.
                  But I warn you, the acquaintance of these daughters of dance and song is costly,
                  and sometimes dangerous, for they love costly gifts, and most of them have lovers
                  who do not like rivalry and sometimes use cold steel to put a rival out of the
                  way."</p>
               <p>"I care not for cost or for danger, I must see that singer again," said Everett,
                  excitedly. "I never before saw such beauty, never heard a voice so utterly sweet
                  lieutenant, you must pardon me, but I have been carried away by what I have seen
                  and heard."</p>
               <p>"I am glad that I have not failed in my endeavor to give you a pleasant insight
                  into a life we Cubans of wealth and leisure can live," said Don Francisco. "I will
                  communicate with La Bella Carolina during the day, and learn from her where she
                  will grant you a private interview.—She is very select in making acquaintances,
                  but will deny no friend of mine."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I am a thousand times obliged to you," replied Everett. "I know not how to
                  thank you."</p>
               <p>"Poh—do not speak of such trifling services. While you stay in Havana, I hope to
                  make many more hours pass agreeably to you And now let us talk of other matters,
                  over a cup of soothing coffee and a cigar," replied the Spaniard, and he rung the
                  first bell once more.</p>
               <p>The coffee and cigars came up on a table in an instant, with a small golden lamp
                  at which to light the cigars.</p>
               <p>"Now, while we smoke and sip our mocha, I will speak of <choice>
                     <sic>somothing</sic>
                     <corr>something</corr>
                  </choice> which my uncle, the Conde De Leon, was talking about last night. He has
                  almost everything which wealth can command, but he lacks one thing which he must
                  have—a yacht. And he wants one, which, in speed and beauty, can find no superior
                  on the ocean; and he thinks, as I do, that the vessel in which you sail, excels
                  all others afloat in both points. Do you think that she could be bought?'</p>
               <p>"I do not know—my father owns one half and Captain Rhett the other. While this war
                  with England lasts, I doubt if either of them would listen to an offer for her,"
                  replied Everett.</p>
               <p>"Not if the amount offered was full double her cost?" asked Don Francisco.</p>
               <p>"No, for if she is, for a year, as lucky as she has been in the last two or three
                  months, she will pay for herself fifty times over. Money will hardly buy her now.
                  In time of peace, it would be different."</p>
               <p>"But for yourself, would you not rather <emph>command</emph> her as a yacht, if
                  owned by a man who could fill her cabins with such sirens as have charmed your
                  senses here to-day, than to be her second officer while she is a privateer, with
                  the chances of capture and destruction against her crew?" said the wily
                  Spaniard.</p>
               <p>"You need not ask that question twice," said Everett eagerly. "But even if she did
                  belong to your uncle, he would hardly choose <emph>me</emph> to command her, while
                     <emph>you</emph> were with him!"</p>
               <p>"He would, if I recommended you, for he is one of the dearest and cleverest old
                  uncles you ever knew or heard of. He consults me in everything, and takes my
                  advice in most matters. He lives only for enjoyment and likes to see every one
                  swim in a sea of pleasure, who are in any way connected with him. If he could get
                  your brig for a yacht, he would make you her commander, I know."</p>
               <p>"If I had possession of her now, he should have her at her own price, or for
                  nothing!" "But Rhett and Cromwell are both above me. Were they out of the way, the
                  command would devolve upon me, and then I could do as I pleased."</p>
               <p>"Would it be very difficult to get them out of the way?" asked Don Francisco
                  quietly, his dark eye bent upon Everett, and seeming to look into his very
                  soul.</p>
               <p>"What do you mean?" asked Everett, lowering his voice.</p>
               <p>"That they might come on shore, and <emph>lose their way</emph>, so that they
                  could not find their route back to the brig again," said Don Francisco, in a tone
                  but little louder than a whisper.</p>
               <p>Everett looked him in the face, and both in a moment seemed to understand each
                  other.</p>
               <p>"If they came ashore together, do you think you could so manage matters that they
                  would not go on board again?" asked the young American.</p>
               <p>"Yes, with gold, one can do almost anything in Havana; and, thanks to my uncles
                  treasury, I can command any amount of that article," replied the Spaniard.</p>
               <p>"Then you are answered," said Everett. If they are but out of the way, so that I
                  am in command of the brig, she shall become your uncle's yacht, if I am still to
                  retain the command. Is that a bargain?"</p>
               <p>"It is, and I will kiss the holy cross upon it," said Don Francisco. Now, Amigo
                  mia, be silent and prudent, and proceed cautiously, and we will carry the matter
                  through. We must get your Captain and his first officer to visit my Uncle two or
                  three times at his palace, before we act. Since you think he would not listen to
                  an offer to purchase the vessel, I will caution my Uncle, and no such offer will
                  be made. We will trust to ourselves, and to you, to gain possession of her.
                  Captain Rhett and his first officer will be received with the hospitality, which
                  will make them think that my uncle is one of the most liberal, as well as one of
                  the most enthusiastic friends of the republican cause that they ever met. They
                  shall be thrown completely off their guard by kindness, and then, when the time
                  comes to put them out of your way, the matter will be disposed of as easily as
                  many another case is, which causes very little stir in this city. Scarcely a night
                  passes, without some poor devil getting a few inches of steel for a late
                  supper."</p>
               <p>"I shall be careful how I stay out late," said Everett nervously.</p>
               <p>"Oh, you need not fear any danger while you are under my protection," said Don
                  Francisco, with a smile. "The worst brave in Havana would not dare to injure
                  unbidden, a friend to the Conde de Leon. They know that justice can be bought as
                  well as evaded, with money. In my search for pleasure, I sometimes have to get rid
                  of an obstacle, and a few ounces of gold will always accomplish my object. But I
                  see you have finished your cigar. Now, drive out with me to the palace of my
                  Uncle, and we will drive with him, and then we will return to seek the interview
                  with the lonely Bella Carolina. I will write a note, and leave it, before I
                  go."</p>
               <p>And the young Spaniard took a card case from his pocket, and a wrote few lines on
                  the back of a card.</p>
               <p>As they went out he handed the card to the servant at the door, and told him to
                  take it, at once, to the Senorita Carolina, and to say that they would call for
                  the answer at eight o'clock on that evening.</p>

               <p>"NELLIE, my dear child, what is the matter with you? You are ill, I know, for you
                  are pale as a ghost, and I never see the smile now, which always used to welcome
                  me when you came from your chamber in the morning. Tell me, Nellie, tell your old
                  father, what is the matter with you. Do you want a doctor?"</p>
               <p>These earnest words were spoken by Mr. Exerett, as his daughter came down to the
                  breakfast table one morning, some two months after Clarence Rhett had sent his
                  prize into port, and sailed with the Cloud-rift for southern latitudes.</p>
               <p>"Father I am not ill, but I am so anxious about the fate of the Cloud-rift and—and
                  those on board. It is so long since we have heard from her, and though I am not
                  superstitions, yet three times have I dreamed of seeing my brother Robert with his
                  hands red with blood, and that fearful look of hatred on his face. These dreams
                  have worried me, and I cannot help it."</p>
               <p>'Dear child, you should not be so nervous. Dreams are but idle fancies of an
                  overwrought brain. It is not strange that we have not heard from the Cloud-rift
                  yet, for our whole coast has been so closely blockaded by the British that vessels
                  could neither get out or in. The Schooner which was to have left Boston<pb
                     n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6960-00000032"/> for Havana, with my letters on board, is
                  in port yet, but I got a letter from the Captain last night informing me that all
                  but two of the English fleet, off the Boston waters, had gone south, and he meant
                  to try to slip out in the course to-night, or to-morrow night, as the new moon set
                  early. If he gets out he will make the voyage out and back as quick as possible,
                  he has been so long delayed, and when he comes back we will be sure to hear from
                  the brig; and then you will see what faith you can put in dreams."</p>
               <p>"What is the name of the Schooner, father?"</p>
               <p>"The Carrollita, Nellie, commanded by Captain Brady, who used to run a fruit
                  Schooner for me to the same port."</p>
               <p>"Captain Fred Brady? I remember him well," said Nellie, musingly. "He used to
                  always send me a basket of choice fruit when he came into port."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I remember. He sails for Goodrich and Co. now. But let me have my coffee,
                  child. The toast is getting cold, and so is the steak. And do try and eat
                  something yourself. You are getting as thin as a shadow."</p>
               <p>"I will try dear father," replied Nellie, as she poured out the coffee for
                  him.</p>
               <p>But so absent minded was she that she handed it to him without adding cream and
                  sugar as usual.</p>
               <p>"If I did not know better, Nellie I'd think you had fallen in love lately," said
                  the old merchant, smiling. "You have forgotten to sweeten my coffee."</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, father; I do <choice>
                     <sic>beleive</sic>
                     <corr>believe</corr>

                  neglect.</p>
               <p>"Look out child—that is salt, not sugar, you are dipping your spoon into, cried
                  Mr. Everett laughing.</p>
               <p>"So it <emph>is</emph>—I believe I'm getting blind or foolish," said Nellie, angry
                  with herself for being so careless.</p>
               <p>She now saw that his coffee was properly fixed, and she tried to eat something
                  herself; but her mind seemed pre-occupied, and she only answered her father, when

               <p>ON the fourth day after he arrived in port, Clarence Rhett and his officers
                  Cromwell, and Everett, and the doctor, accepted the invitation extended by the
                  Conde de Leon through his Nephew, Lieutenant Francisco, to partake of the
                  hospitalities of the Conde at his palace.</p>
               <p>Young Everett had made no mention on board that he had already dined at the
                  palace, for he had been advised not to do so by Don Francisco, as also by the
                  Conde and Captain Martinez, with both of whom the young man had come to a perfect
                  understanding.</p>
               <p>Clarence had seen in his eastern voyage; the great display of wealth and
                  magnificence made by the oriental princes, but never in all his travels, had he
                  seen a richer display than met his eyes in the palace of the Conde de Leon.</p>
               <p>Nothing in the shape of luxury in furniture or ornament, or in the <choice>

                  </choice> of animal as well as mental taste, was lacking. The table of the Conde
                  was loaded down with choice viands, served on plates of gold and silver; wines and
                  liquors of the choicest kinds, all sparkled on the board; and a servant to each
                  guest I love, ready to execute every wish that was uttered.</p>
               <p>The <choice>

                     <corr>Conde</corr>
                  </choice>, in extending this kindness to Clarence quite won the heart of the
                  latter by his declaration, that he did so out of his great and loving sympathy for
                  the brave and young republic which dared to dispute old England's boasted
                  Supremacy of the waves.</p>
               <p>And when after he and his officers had been regaled sumptuously, and feasted, too,
                  with music both vocal and instrumental, of the best and rarest character, they
                  returned pleased and gratified beyond measure.</p>
               <p>Clarence had insisted upon the Conde coming on board the Cloud-rift, to partake
                  take of such hospitality as he could offer, and the <choice>
                     <sic>Coude</sic>
                     <corr>Conde</corr>
                  </choice> had promised to do so at an early day.</p>
               <p>"Doctor, what do you think of Havana, now?" asked Clarence of Doctor Joshua, when
                  they were all once more on board the brig.</p>
               <p>"I like the place well, and the people better," said the doctor. "They seem to
                  think that a Yankee is about as good as one of their saints, and they feed and
                  drink a creatur awful nice. I think I'm getting fattened up some, though I've
                  always been counted as one of Pharaoh's lean kind. I've only one fault to find
                  with these folks here!"</p>
               <p>"What is that, doctor?" asked Clarence.</p>
               <p>"They seem to think that we're all copper-lined and copper-fastened inside," said
                  the doctor. "They make everything they cook red hot with red pepper. I'm all
                  burned up with it."</p>
               <p>"You'll soon get used to that, doctor. And how about the yellow fever? Have you
                  seen any cases of that!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, I've seen a dozen die of it, and learned how their doctors treat it.
                  When a chap gets the <hi rend="i"/>vomits negro—that's what they call it—they just
                  shove a table spoonful of calomel into him, without stopping to weigh it. If that
                  cures the patient, well and good—if it doesn't, and he dies, then it is well and
                  good still, for all the doctors care. That is their rule and their dose, and it
                  must cure or kill."</p>
               <p>"Which does it do in a majority of cases?" asked Clarence.</p>
               <p>"If the patient has a constitution as strong as that of a mule, he will most
                  likely outlive the dose. If he hasn't, the yellow fever kills him: so their
                  victims say. But I'd say the calomel done the job."</p>
               <p>"Well you need not experiment in their practice with me, if I should get sick,"
                  said Clarence with a laugh. "Have you seen a bull fight yet, as you desired
                  doctor?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir, there is to be one Sunday, and I'm going to that."</p>
               <p>"What, doctor, you a Massachusetts man and go to a place of amusement on Sunday?
                  I'm really astonished to hear you say so!"</p>
               <p>"I believe, Cap'n, that I left Massachusetts at home when I come away," said the
                  doctor gravely. "I used to hear my old boss say, when a chap gits to Rome he must
                  do as the Romans do, and when he is in Turkey he must do as the Turkies do; and
                  now I'm here in Cuba, I <choice>
                     <sic>dou't</sic>
                     <corr>don't</corr>
                  </choice> see what harm there is in doin' as I see the Cubas do. They don't make
                  no fuss about keepin' Sunday, and why should I? When I get back to Massachusetts,
                  if I ever do, I'll eat cold pork and beans and hear preachin' on Sunday, just as I
                  used to, I s'pose."</p>
               <p>"Well, I was only trying to tease you a little, doctor. You must not mind my
                  bantering."</p>
               <p>"No more I will, Cap'n. How long will we stay here, do you think, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Only a few days more, doctor. We are ready for sea now, but I feel anxious to
                  hear from home, and as some Boston vessels are looked for every day, I will wait a
                  little while in hopes of getting a mail. A stay here, on ripe fruit, and fresh
                  meat, and vegetable diet for the men, will improve their health, will it not?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Cap'n—of course it will. But the men must keep out of the night dews. The
                  hot sun in the day time, and the cold dews at night, is what fetches those that
                  are not used to it. I've learned that much since I've been here, and it is worth
                  rememberin'."</p>
               <p>"So it is, doctor, and I will see that the men are cautioned about it. They seem
                  to take pretty good care of themselves so far."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir; but it's because they know they've got to, or suffer. I've told 'em if
                  I got to dosin' 'em, they'd have more pukin' and sweatin' to go through than ever
                  they've heard tell of before, and I reckon I've kinder got 'em skeered. Folks can
                  be skeered into sickness, and they can be skeered out of it, too. I knowed a woman
                  once, that had the Rheumatiz so she couldn't walk. She was a layin' in bed, on as
                  cold a winter day as you ever shivered in, and all the folks was off away from the
                  house on some arrant or other, when a brand rolled<pb n="64-65"
                     xml:id="VAC6960-00000033"/> out from the fire place, and set the carpet ablaze.
                  She laid and hollered for a little while, but no one didn't hear her, and the fire
                  kept a spreadin,' and she knowed sartin' sure, that she'd be burnt up alive if she
                  laid there. So she stopped hollerin,' and up and jumped out of bed in her
                  night-gown, jist as she was, and put off out of doors as hard as she could run,
                  forgetting all about her rheumatiz. The house got all afire before anybody came,
                  and she had to walk most half a mile to a neighbors, bare foot through the snow.
                  You'd have thought 'twould have killed her, wouldn't you, Cap'n?"</p>
               <p>"To be sure I would," replied Clarence Rhett.</p>
               <p>"Well it didn't," said the doctor. "Just as sure as my name is Joshua for long,
                  and <emph>old Josh</emph> for short, it cured her, and I'm a livin' witness to it.
                  The Rheumatiz, you see, was clean skeered out of her. And I knowed another woman,
                  that had the fever and ague awful—so bad that you'd feel the house shake when the
                  chills took her. She wasn't skeered out of that, though. 'Twas madness done it.
                  She had an awful temper of her own, and when she got her <emph>Ebenezer</emph>
                  riz, old Satan couldn't skeer her. She was in a chill one day, and shakin' awful
                  bad, when a Jew peddler came along that had sold her some starched cotton
                  handkerchiefs for linen, two years' before, and in making change gin her a pewter
                  quarter dollar besides. Now, she knew the mean cuss the minute she set eyes on
                  him, and all shakin' with the chill as she was, she taxed him with it.</p>
               <p>"He up and said he'd never been in her house, nor set eyes, on her before. Her
                     <emph>Ebenezer</emph> riz when she heard him say that, and she jumped out of
                  bed and pitched into him, till he hollered murder, and everything else but his
                  prayers, and then she tossed him, pack and all, out of doors. She got so hot a
                  doin' this, that she forgot all about her chill, and she never had one after that
                  either."</p>
               <p>Rhett laughed as the doctor related these miraculous cures, but was spared from
                  hearing any more of them, by being sent for to see to some duty on deck.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXX.</head>
               <p>AFTER Don Francisco had taken Robert Everett to the palace De Leon for the first
                  time, and introduced him to his uncle and Captain Martinez, and the young American
                  had dined, and been filled as full of wine as he could be and "navigate" without
                  tumbling down, the Spaniard brought him back, agreeably to promise, to see the
                  beautiful <choice>
                     <sic>womaa</sic>
                     <corr>woman</corr>
                  </choice> whose loveliness and harmonious voice, had so enchanted him in the
                  morning.</p>
               <p>The wine which he had taken tended to make him more inflammable than ever, and
                  when he found himself face to face, again, with the person whom he thought to be
                  the most beautiful being he had ever seen, he actually went on his knees and
                  kissed her hands, when Don Francisco presented him to her.</p>
               <p>Her smile seemed to him to be angelic, as she spoke to him in Spanish, and
                  motioned for him to rise: but as he did not understand the language, he appealed
                  to Don Francisco to know what she said.</p>
               <p>"She says that she is flattered by the preference such a handsome and noble
                  looking young man expresses for her, and she hopes to improve the acquaintance,"
                  replied Don Francisco. "She is very sorry that she does not understand English, or
                  you understand Spanish, so that you might converse with her freely."</p>
               <p>"Tell her that she can never be half so sorry as I am. That I never heard music in
                  my life until I heard her sing this morning, and that I shall not rest until I
                  have learned her language, so that I can tell her how much I love her."</p>
               <p>Don Francisco having translated this speech to the lady, she replied in words
                  which he thus rendered to the enamored young American.</p>
               <p>"She says that love needs no language to express itself. It speaks through the
                  eyes—it finds words in sighs, volumes in looks, and whole histories in
                  actions."</p>
               <p>"It is true, and if I had a face as expressive as hers, she could read that my
                  whole soul was devoted to her," replied Everett.</p>
               <p>"There is danger in loving her, she bids me tell you," said Don Francisco, after
                  translating his remarks to the lady, and hearing her reply.</p>
               <p>"Tell her I fear no danger. I would face a hundred men for one sweet smile from
                  her," said the infatuated young man.</p>
               <p>"She says the danger will not come from any male rivals," said Don Francisco, "but
                  if she should once love you and find you false to her—should ever detect you
                  paying any attention to another woman, she would kill you. She never could bear a
                  rival in your heart."</p>
               <p>"Tell her that there is no woman on earth so beautiful as she, and that the man
                  who could desert her for another, ought to die a thousand deaths," answered
                  Everett.</p>
               <p>"She says such love, and such words, as you breathe, must be rewarded. She will
                  try to love you, for you look as if you could be trusted."</p>
               <p>"Could be? I will be. Truth shall go hand in hand with my love for her," said
                  Everett. "Tell her who I am, and who my father is. Tell her I will marry her, and
                  when my father dies, she will have the wealth of half a kingdom at her command.
                  Tell her there is nothing on earth she can ask, that I will not get for her."</p>
               <p>Don Francisco translated this wild outburst, and the lady replied that there was
                  no mercenary thought in her bosom—that the love which was based upon fortune, was
                  not such love as a Spanish woman could feel.</p>
               <p>Everett now begged Don Francisco to ask her, if she would go to sea with him in
                  case he should have the command of a beautiful yacht. She bade Don Francisco say,
                  that, if once she yielded her heart to him, and she feared that she would have to,
                  she would go with him to the end of the earth, on sea or on land: that nothing but
                  death should ever tear them apart.</p>
               <p>"Then, were a thousand Rhetts and Cromwells between me and her, they should die!"
                  cried Everett. "If you, Don Francisco, find any difficulty in getting men to put
                  them out of the way, I will do the deed with my own hands. Were hell itself to be
                  my portion, I would dare its Sable King, to call La Bella Carolina mine!"</p>
               <p>"She shall be yours," said Don Francisco. "I can see, by her looks, that her heart
                  is more than half won. But she bids me say that your first interview must be brief
                  with her, for she has a musical engagement to-night, which she must fill. She
                  hopes the day will soon come, when she will not have to sing for any one but
                  you."</p>
               <p>"It shall not be my fault if that day is long deferred," said Everett. "Tell her I
                  go, but only to think of her while I wake, and to dream of her while I sleep."</p>
               <p>"She says you must come soon to see her again—that whenever you send your card in
                  to her, she will be visible to you, and she hopes you will soon learn her
                  language, so as to talk without an interpreter."</p>
               <p>"Tell her this night I will commence to study it, and love shall aid me in
                  mastering it," replied Everett.</p>
               <p>The lady now extended her hand to the young man, who pressed it wildly to his
                  feverish lips, and as she retired from the room, his glance <choice>

               <p>"What do you think of her now," asked Don Francisco, as they left the house.</p>
               <p>"I do not think, I am too much in love to think. I worship her!" said Everett. I
                  cannot rest, or enjoy life, till she is mine."</p>

                  rigged as a fore-and-after, but with a large square-sail yard to each mast, by
                  which, when the wind was abeam or abaft it, two immense square sails could be
                  hoisted to accelerate her speed. Though, when on a wind, or the wind was forward
                  of the beam, she was reduced to the fore-and-aft<pb n="66-67"
                     xml:id="VAC6960-00000034"/> aft canvass. This consisted of a fore and mainsail,
                  jib and flying jib, and two flying gaff topsails.</p>
               <p>In case of heavy weather she had two small-corned sails and her main and
                  forestays, to lay to under.</p>
               <p>Her cabin was large, and took up full one half of the room abaft the main-mast,
                  being under a high half deck, with all the cabin store rooms in the hold under
                  it.</p>
               <p>In front of this cabin walked Captain Fred Brady, a neat and rather dandified man
                  for a sailor, of middle age, bright-eyed and rosy cheeked, though he had weathered
                  full five and thirty years of stormy life upon the ocean. His schooner was loaded
                  to the bend, with notions and garden-truck for a Cuban market, and she laid at the
                  long wharf, with but a single bow and stern line out, waiting only for darkness to
                  set in, to try and make the hazardous run past the English blockaders off the
                  harbor's mouth, and get to sea. The sun was just setting, when Captain Brady saw a
                  very neat looking young sailor boy, with a large bundle under his arm, come
                  hastily down the wharf, and jump lightly on board.</p>
               <p>"Can I see the Captain, sir?" said the boy in a low voice.</p>
               <p>"You can, and do, my little chap," said Captain Fred, pleasantly, for all of his
                  crew were aboard, sober and steady and he was in the best of humor. "What can I do
                  for you?"</p>
               <p>"You are going to the Havana, are you not, Sir?" asked the boy.</p>
               <p>"Yes, if we have good luck, and none of the John Bull men-of-war catch me,"
                  replied Captain Fred.</p>
               <p>"If you please, sir, don't you want a nice cabin boy! I'm very handy, can wash
                  dishes, set the table, and cook, too, if you want me to."</p>
               <p>Captain Fred looked at the boy attentively. He saw that his hands were very white,
                  and that he had not been used to hard work. His face was very red, flushed with
                  excitement, and his eyes were liquid as if but one harsh word would bring tears
                  from them.</p>
               <p>Therefore he spoke kindly when he said.</p>
               <p>"I'm afraid you're running away from your parents, my boy."</p>
               <p>"<choice>
                     <sic>Iudeed</sic>
                     <corr>Indeed</corr>
                  </choice>, no, sir—mother is dead and—and—oh, please do let me go with you,
                  sir."</p>
               <p>And the tear cloud gave way, and the rain of that young heart's storm poured down
                  the boy's cheeks.</p>
               <p>"There, there, don't cry, my poor boy. You shall go with me, if you want to. I
                  have only my old steward in the cabin, and he is getting stiff and careless. Go
                  into the cabin, and tell him to show you the little state-room next to the
                  cupboard. You may put your bundle in that, for I have no passengers this trip, and
                  you can have a snug and cosy place to sleep in."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, sir, I will be so good and so handy, you will not be sorry that you
                  let me go."</p>
               <p>And the boy hurried away into the cabin.</p>
               <p>"A nice looking youngster—I like him," said Captain Fred complacently.</p>
               <p>And then, as the twilight gloom began to deepen over the town, and cast a darker
                  shade upon the water, he sung out to his crew:</p>
               <p>"Look sharp, lads, and stand to the halliards. I shall cast off as soon as it is
                  so dark, that I can't see the white of that cursed cruiser's topsails down the
                  bay, and that will be in five minutes, the way night is hurrying on."</p>
               <p>The men, some twelve or fourteen in number, sprung to the halliards, and stood
                  waiting the order to hoist away, watching the rippling of the water in the harbor,
                  stirred by a brisk north-westerly wind.</p>
               <p>The order soon came, and ere "hoist away" had fairly left the lips of Captain
                  Fred, the fore and mainsails were sliding up the well-greased masts, while not a
                  creaking block betrayed the movement.</p>
               <p>In a few minutes the sails were up, and then the cheerful voice of Captain Fred
                  sung out—</p>
               <p>"Up jib and cast off the shore-lines, fore and aft!"</p>
               <p>The order was obeyed, and the next instant the schooner swayed off into the
                  stream, and as the sails filled nicely, she shot away from the wharf like a thing
                  of life.</p>
               <p>"Ease off the sheets a little, Mr. Evalong, take the helm till we get outside,"
                  cried the Captain, his last order being addressed to his first mate, a long,
                  dried-up looking son of Cape-Cod.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Ackerman," he added to the second mate," you take the look out forward, and
                  keep your eyes peeled sharp, for we may run right on to one of them cruisers
                  before we know it. Not a light, or even a pipe must be seen on board for the next
                  three hours."</p>
               <p>The schooner was now full a cable's length clear of the wharf, and sliding away
                  swiftly from it, but so still was the wind and water, that the noise of a chaise
                  driven furiously down the wharf, could be distinctly heard and the dim outlines of
                  it seen; but the schooner kept gliding on, and a hail from a person who sprung
                  from the chaise, waving his hat furiously, was just heard, but could not be
                  understood.</p>
               <p>"You're too late, whatever you want," said Captain Fred, quietly. "I wouldn't stop
                  the schooner now, for anybody less than the President of the United States,
                  without he hailed me from the mouth of a cannon."</p>
               <p>Captain Fred had been looking at the person on shore while he spoke, and had not
                  seen the wild look of terror in the face of his little cabin-boy, who had watched
                  the progress of the chaise down the wharf with trembling anxiety. The anxious
                  look, however, passed from the face of the boy, when he heard the Captain say that
                  he would not stop the schooner, and the lad glided back into the cabin unnoticed,
                  while Captain Fred passed forward among his crew, cautioning them not to speak a
                  loud word, or to make any noise, lest it might attract attention on board the
                  vessels, which he was about to try to pass; for he knew that watchful eyes and
                  listening ears, would be on the alert in them.</p>
               <p>As the schooner drew out from under the land, and felt the freshening breeze, she
                  went faster and faster, and now the night grew all dark around them, and only by
                  the compass course, shown in a well shaded binnacle, could it be known how she was
                  heading.</p>
               <p>Three hours of anxious silence followed, and for the last hour of that time, the
                  long heavy swell of the ocean waves told that the schooner was outside of all
                  shoals and headlands.</p>
               <p>Then Captain Fred, who had all this time walked the deck, anxiously, said in a low
                  tone:</p>
               <p>"Half the crew can go below. The first mate's watch stay on deck. We're all clear
                  now. Mr. Evalong, keep her away South East by East, and let one of the regular men
                  relieve you at the helm!"</p>
               <p>These orders obeyed, and the sails trimmed to suit the course, Captain Fred went
                  into the cabin, with a light heart and a contented air.</p>
               <p>The lamps had just been lighted by his order, and the Captain looked pleased, as
                  he saw his little cabin-boy moving about with a light and active step, setting the
                  supper table as softly as if he had been engaged at such work from the days of his
                  babyhood.</p>
               <p>"Not sea-sick? Been to sea before. I reckon!" said Captain Fred to the lad.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Sir, a little in fishing boats outside. I never was sea-sick even
                  there."</p>
               <p>"So much the better. You'd break no crockery, and won't spill the victuals all
                  over the deck, when you bring the dishes from the caboose," said Captain Fred.
                  "And now you're name—I must know what to call you, when you're wanted."</p>
               <p>"You may call me Clarence, Sir," said the boy.</p>
               <p>"Clarence? That is a very nice name. I never knew but one Clarence, and he was
                  just about as nice a chap as they make in hard times. I had him with me when I run
                  a schooner in the fruit trade, for old Mr. Everett, down in Salem. A smart boy he
                  was, and has turned out a full man I've heard."</p>
               <p>Where were Captain Fred Brady's eyes just then, that he did not see the crimson
                  flush which passed over his young cabin-boy's face, when he thus alluded to
                  Clarence Rhett? His eyes were in the right place all the time, but they could not
                  see through the back of the cabin boy's head, for that individual had<pb n="68-69"
                     xml:id="VAC6960-00000035"/> turned his head away while Captain Fred was
                  speaking, and seemed to be looking very intently at the steward, who was chipping
                  some dried beef in the pantry.</p>
               <p>"He's off privateerin' now, and I've got letters in my mail bag for him from
                  Salem, which I reckon he'll be glad to get. There's two of 'em in the old man's
                  hand writin, and one that isn't. It's in a neat little hand, such as I've seen
                  more'n once, when I used to send up pretty Nellie baskets of fruit from the
                  schooner. Master Clarence always used to beg leave to carry up them baskets, and I
                  reckon there was more than fruit went with em some times."</p>
               <p>All of this was spoken musingly and to himself, by Captain Fred, but his cabin-boy
                  was listening to it with a strange, but sweet smile on his quiet face, which he
                  took care to keep turned away, so that the captain did not observe it.</p>
               <p>In a little while the supper table was set, and so neatly, that Capt. Fred looked
                  at it with surprise.</p>
               <p>"How do you like my new cabin-boy, steward?" he asked, while the youngster had
                  gone to the caboose after the tea.</p>
               <p>"Amazin' well, Sir," said the steward, an old parchment-colored faced man, who had
                  sailed with Captain Fred ever since he commanded a vessel. He's as spry as a cat,
                  and just the handiest with dishes that I ever saw. He don't leave scarce anything
                  for me to do."</p>
               <p>"So much the better for you, Steward, for it's full time you had help in the
                  cabin. I've been thinking of looking for some one a good while, and this youngster
                  come aboard just at the right time. He will be a great relief to you, if he keeps
                  on as well as he has commenced."</p>
               <p>The return of Clarence as he called himself, with the tea, put a stop to this <choice>
                     <sic>cololoquy</sic>
                     <corr>colloquy</corr>
                  </choice>, and the Captain was informed that supper was ready.</p>
               <p>"Then call down Mr. Ackerman, so that he can get his supper and relieve Evalong,"
                  said Captain Fred, and when the second mate came into the cabin he took his seat
                  at the table.</p>
               <p>"You're a real handy boy, Clarence," said the Captain, as the boy poured out his
                  tea. "I've not seen my table look so well for some time, when I get to Havana,
                  I'll get some new crockery and some white table-cloths, for I see you'll take care
                  of things. Who scoured the knives so brightly?'</p>
               <p>"I did sir—they were so black and dirty looking," said the boy.</p>
               <p>"So they were. They look as good as new, And this toast, I'm sure old black Pompey
                  never took the pains to make that."</p>
               <p>"No sir I found some rather stale bread in the cupboard, but toasting it freshens
                  it, and burns out the stale taste."</p>
               <p>"So it does, Steward, you'll have to take lessons from Clarence."</p>
               <p>"If you please sir you'll make some cake to-morrow. I see you have plenty of eggs
                  on board," said the boy.</p>
               <p>"Why how on earth did you learn to make cake?"</p>
               <p>"I used to watch mother, sir. She baked such nice cake. I know I can put in such
                  things as she did."</p>
               <p>"Well I'm not much of a cake hand, but for novelty's sake, you can try. That is,
                  if you and the Steward can agree, for he is your boss as far as the cabin and
                  stores go."</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir, I will get along very well with him. I know he'll like me when he sees
                  me wash the dishes, and put things away in their proper places, as they ought to
                  be."</p>
               <p>"Yes—<emph>I</emph> shall like the boy," said the Steward "He's amazin'
                  handy—amazin' amazin'!"</p>
               <p>And the old man sat down on a campstool before the cup-board, for he saw that
                  there was no need of his waiting on the table while Clarence was around.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXXII</head>
               <p>TEN days had elapsed since the Cloud-rift first dropped anchor in the harbor of
                  Havana. She was again fully ready for sea in every particular, and her young
                  Captain began to be impatient to plough blue water once more. But his great
                  anxiety to hear from Salem still kept him port-bound, a matter which satisfied his
                  crew, for they having behaved well, were allowed a good deal of liberty on shore
                  in the day-time though none but the officers were ever permitted to stay on shore
                  at night.</p>
               <p>Clarence seldom went on shore at night scarcely even visited the shore except on
                  official visits, for he was far more happy in his cabin, where he could study the
                  sweet face of Nellie Everett, in her portrait, than in any company which he could
                  find on shore.</p>
               <p>Cromwell was ever too attentive to duty, true-seaman-like, to care to go much on
                  shore, but young Everett was never on board when he could make an excuse to get
                  onshore, or get permission to remain there.</p>
               <p>After a couple of visits to the palace de Leon, Clarence felt somewhat sickened at
                  the overwrought attentions paid to him by the Conde and his rather suspicious
                  looking and strange acting friend, Captain Martinez, nor did he like the great
                  intimacy between young Everett and Don Francisco.</p>
               <p>He had cautioned the former about it, and with his usual villainous duplicity,
                  Everett had pretended to heed the warning, and to avoid the company of the young
                  Spaniard, but, in truth meetings became more and more frequent.</p>
               <p>Infatuated almost to madness, by the beautiful Siren known to him as La Bella
                  Carolina, really one of the band to which De Leon, Francisco, and Martinez
                  belonged, the young mate spent every moment of the time which he could command, in
                  her company. All of the money which he had, and all that he could get from
                  Clarence, was spent in purchasing presents for her.</p>
               <p>On the evening of the tenth day in port, Robert Everett had obtained permission
                  from Captain Rhett to go on shore and remain for the night, his ostensible reason
                  being a wish to attend the opera to hear "Anna Bolena."</p>
               <p>But instead of visiting the opera house, his steps were immediately directed to
                  the house in the Calle del Rey, where he had been first taken by Don Francisco.
                  Upon knocking at the door, it was opened by the porter, who, by this time, knew
                  him well.</p>
               <p>He handed the servant his card, and bade him take it in to the Senora La Bella
                  Carolina.</p>
               <p>The latter however hesitated to take it, and told him that two gentlemen wished to
                  see him in the <foreign xml:lang="SPA">quarto conversationale</foreign>, and that
                  he had orders to conduct him there as soon as he arrived.</p>
               <p>"Their names?" asked Everett, for the porter spoke English quite well.</p>
               <p>"The Senors Don Francisco and Captain Martinez," replied the porter.</p>
               <p>"Then I will see them first, and the lady afterward," said Everett and he followed
                  the porter to the room known in the establishment as the conversation room.</p>
               <p>The Steward opened the door, announced his name and retired.</p>
               <p>Don Francisco and Captain Martinez met the young mate with indications of
                  coldness, or distrust, and neither of them, as usual, offered him their hands.</p>
               <p>This he noticed at once, and, with an air of anxiety, he asked, as soon as the
                  first salutations had passed, what was the matter.</p>
               <p>"Matter enough to make us believe that you are not dealing fairly with us, Senor
                  Everett," said Captain Martinez with a scowl. "It is three days since you promised
                  to put both Captain Rhett and his friend Cromwell where the sharks would fatten on
                  their bodies. They yet <emph>live!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Yes, because no good opportunity has occurred for me to put my plans in
                  execution; and as the day has not been set for the brig to sail, and she will not
                  sail until mails arrive from the United States, I did not think that haste was
                  imperative."</p>
               <p>"But Senor you said three days ago, that they should not live four and twenty
                  hours. You swore it, on your bended knees, before the Bella Carolina, who loves
                  you almost to madness, and she is dying for the hour when she can skim over the
                  blue water, with you by her side," said Don Francisco.</p>
               <p>"She loves me—I know she loves me,<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6960-00000036"/> and
                  the deed shall be done before another sun rises," cried Everett excitedly.</p>
               <p>"How will you do it?" asked Captain Martinez doubtingly. "Single handed and
                  alone?"</p>
               <p>"No—I have three confederates on board, who will do anything I bid them do. It is
                  my mid-night watch, if I go on board, though expecting to stay on shore, I got the
                  boatswain to keep it for me. I will go on board, and in the mid-watch, I and my
                  companions will go down into the cabin and finish both Cromwell and the Captain,
                  and drop their bodies from the cabin windows, so weighted with ballast that they
                  will sink instantly. Do you see my points?</p>
               <p>"I see points, but not very good ones," said Martinez, after a moment of
                  deliberation. "If either the Captain or the mate should be awake and on their
                  guard, you could not succeed without alarming the crew. If even you did succeed,
                  there would be no reasonable way to account for their absence from the ship, when
                  they were known to be on board at bedtime, and to have retired as usual. <choice>

                  for, and discovered. No, sir, your plan will not do. It is bad. We must form and
                  act upon another. Both of the marked individuals must be decoyed on shore for some
                  purpose or other, and then the steel must do the work. If you can manage to get
                  Captain Rhett and the mate on shore to-morrow night, at this hour or later, I will
                  try to so dispose of them in such way as will disprove the idea that they were
                  killed on board. They must be murdered and robbed on shore, to shew that the deed
                  was done for gain That done properly all suspicion will be cast from you, you will
                  as the next in rank, take command of the Schooner, and then you can apparently
                  sell to us, keep such of the crew as we want on board, and discharge the
                  rest."</p>
               <p>"Your plan, captain, is the very thing. But how to get them on shore together.
                  That is the question. Lately Captain Rhett never comes on shore, and never at
                  night," said Everett with a troubled look.</p>
               <p>"He must be enticed on shore in some way. Does he care for women? A note from one
                  could be written, saying she had seen and loved him, soliciting an interview,"
                  suggested Don Francisco.</p>
               <p>"If you could see him sit for hours, as he does, gazing at the portrait of ray
                  sister which hangs in his cabin, you would see how useless it would be to attempt
                  to put the thought of another woman in his head."</p>
               <p>"You say that he expects letters," said Martinez. "How would it be to send word on
                  board, just after dark, that a Boston vessel had arrived?"</p>
               <p>"He would take his boat and go to work for the vessel at once, and find out that
                  it was false," said Everett.</p>
               <p>"Not if the message apparently came from the American Consul, telling him that
                  letters were there for him," said Martinez.</p>
               <p>"That is so," said Robert. "But what would we do with Cromwell. It is not likely
                  that he would leave the vessel at the same time."</p>
               <p>"No, but if the Captain did not go back, he would come ashore to look for him,
                  would he not?" asked Martinez.</p>
               <p>"Yes. That is so," replied Everett.</p>
               <p>"Then he, too, could be disposed of Now are any of these confederates of yours men
                  of nerve, who would use steel skilfully and without fear? As they know who is to
                  be struck, it would be better to have them do it, than men whom we could engage on
                  shore, for they will not strike wrong men."</p>
               <p>"Two of them, I think, are," said Everett.</p>
               <p>"Two are enough," said Martinez.</p>
               <p>"Then, Otis and Bascomb will do," said Everett, musingly. "Brattle might join, but
                  I noticed that he flinched when under fire, on board the brig."</p>
               <p>"For all that he might be first rate at stabbing in the dark," said Don Francisco,
                  with a laugh. "Give me a coward for a <choice>
                     <sic>theif</sic>
                     <corr>thief</corr>
                  </choice> or a murderer any day; for their cowardice makes them so prudent, that
                  they will almost always escape detection. When no return blow is expected, the
                  most nervous man in the world could strike firmly."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps Don Francisco is right," said Everett. "But at any rate, I do not like to
                  trust Brattle. He is too talkative."</p>
               <p>"Well, as you like. Now let the other men get permission to come on shore, and,
                  once here, they can remain and be ready, at any moment, for the work."</p>
               <p>"What, desert?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, let them appear to desert, and we will provide safe quarters for them. If we
                  can get Rhett ashore tomorrow night, the work can be done then. It is almost too
                  late to operate to night."</p>
               <p>"Very well, then I can spend the evening with my Queen of Song, La Bella Carolina,
                  the magnificent."</p>
               <p>"Yes. Don Francisco and myself have an engagement, and we will not detain you any
                  longer. Let us see you or hear from you tomorrow, and have your men on shore
                  early, so that they can be armed and instructed. You know where to send them to.
                  Give them a note to me."</p>
               <p>"I will, Captain," said Everett, as Martinez and his companion rose to leave.</p>
               <p>"Since all is now understood, and you appear anxious to push the work forward, I
                  confess more confidence than I had in you before, Senor Everett," said Don
                  Francisco; and I wish you a pleasant evening with the beautiful Bella Carolina. To
                  win such a woman as she is, a man ought to dare any deed, however perilous. But as
                  matters now look, your peril will be nothing. Management is all that is
                  required."</p>
               <p>And the two Spaniards left the room.</p>
               <p>"Now, to find the Bella Carolina," said Everett.</p>
               <p>And he went in search of her.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXXIII.</head>
               <p>AFTER Robert Everett had asked permission to go on shore, on the evening alluded
                  to in the previous chapter, Cromwell, who was on deck when the boat that carried
                  him left the brig's side, said to himself in a musing way:</p>
               <p>"There is mischief at work in that young devil's head. Never did a nor'wester show
                  signs before its coming, plainer than he does. He has got part of the crew to
                  think a great deal of him. by his soft words and by making their duty easy when he
                  is on watch. Over twenty of them were his boon companions in Salem, and they
                  shipped in the brig through his influence. He always shows a preference to them.
                  What he does on shore so much, is another mystery to me. He consorts with that
                  Francisco and Martinez, and I am more than satisfied that there is no good in
                  them. I dont like to speak ill of any one, but I must have a talk with the Captain
                  about this."</p>
               <p>And the mate descended into the cabin.</p>
               <p>In the after cabin, reclining upon a settee, looking musingly up at the portrait
                  of Nellie Everett, he found Captain Rhett.</p>
               <p>"Captain," said he bluntly, coming at once to the point, "I believe that Bob
                  Everett is studying out some nasty trick to play us."</p>
               <p>"How so? What discovery have you made, Mr Cromwell?" asked Clarence, with a look
                  of surprise on his fine face.</p>
               <p>"I can hardly tell, sir, only I have noticed this. He is one thing when your eye
                  is on him, and another when it is not. He is as pleasant as sunshine when he is
                  talking to you, but I have seen him, when <choice>
                     <sic>yonr</sic>
                     <corr>your</corr>
                  </choice> back was turned, regard you with a look of hatred blacker than a thunder
                  cloud, He hates me, I know, for he takes but little pains to conceal it. That I do
                  not care for, for he never can get to windward of me, while I have my eyes open.
                  But he means to do something to injure you, I'm sure. You advised him not to keep
                  company with that Francisco any more, and he told you he would not. Yet he never
                  goes ashore without going direct to meet him; and I am as well satisfied that that
                  Spaniard is a regular cut-throat, as I am that the moon is not made of green
                  cheese. He pretends to you that he never drinks. I can prove that he always takes
                  liquor when he goes on shore, and on board too, eating burnt coffee to take away
                  the scent from his breath. I dare say, that a good quantity could be found in
                     his<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6960-00000037"/> state-room now, if you were to
                  look into it."</p>
               <p>"Well, it may be that your suspicions have good foundation, Mr. Cromwell, though I
                  hate to think so, his father having so fondly trusted in the thought, that this
                  cruise would make a man of him. But we will watch him closely hereafter. If he is
                  right, it will do no harm. If he is wrong, the more the pity, but we can foil any
                  evil which he designs."</p>
               <p>"He can do us no harm here in port, Sir, without he means personal harm to either
                  you or me, when we are on shore, where a man can have another one's throat cut for
                  a doubloon. But at sea, if we were to have a great many men away in prizes, he
                  might create a mutiny in the brig. I wish he never had come on board."</p>
               <p>"So do I," said Captain Rhett, "I opposed it at first, but his father said he had
                  no hopes of him unless I would take him te sea, and for his sake I did it. As to
                  his going any more with those suspicious Spaniards, I will put a stop to it. When
                  he again asks permission to go on shore, it will not be given. He has drawn a
                  great deal of money from me already—more than his share of the prize will come to,
                  and wanted more this afternoon. I questioned him as to his manner of spending so
                  much, and he said he had been buying some jewelry for his sister. But he did not
                  offer to show it to me, and I strongly suspect, that he has been a losing customer
                  at some of Monte Banks in town. I know that he used to gamble, and it is not
                  likely that he has got rid of the habit. He has liberty until to-morrow morning,
                  but that will be the end of his shore-going. I wish a Boston vessel would come in
                  with letters for us, for delay here now is irksome. I will not stay here much
                  longer, whether a mail comes or not."</p>
               <p>"I am glad to hear it, Sir, for the crew have been here long enough. When we were
                  at sea, they rather liked to exercise at the brig's guns, and with small arms.
                  Now, it is hard work to get them at it at all"</p>
               <p>"Well, they shall soon go where they will have exercise enough. When I leave
                  Havana, I shall run the line from the West Indies to the mouth of the English
                  Channel, and take what prizes I can, and when I get into the channel, right under
                  their own noses, I'll make the British think that the ghost of old Paul Jones has
                  come upon them."</p>
               <p>"That will be rare fun, Sir," said Cromwell. "Brisky, too; but the brig is equal
                  to anything, I believe. Her match in speed has yet to be built."</p>
               <p>"That's so," said Clarence, as the mate turned and left the cabin.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXIV.</head>
               <p>WHEN Robert Everett returned on board the brig in the morning, he was so pale, and
                  nervous as well, that Captain Rhett could not avoid noticing it.</p>
               <p>"You do not seem well, Mr. Everett." said he. "Had you not better consult Doctor
                  Fowler. In this climate, fever creeps so insidiously upon the best of
                  constitutions, that one cannot be too careful, when symptoms appear, to take early
                  advice."</p>
               <p>"There's nothing the matter with me, Sir," said Everest, nervous however in tone
                  as well as manner. "If there was, I do not think I d trouble old Fowler with it.
                  He might do to doctor cows' but not me."</p>
               <p>Robert Everett might not have made that remark, had he known that the old doctor
                  was at that moment in his state-room, not six feet from him, engaged in stuffing
                  the skin of a monkey for preservation.</p>
               <p>But there the doctor was, and when he heard the spiteful "fling" made by Everett,
                  he opened his door, and said, in a tone as dry as the music from an old saw when
                  operated on by a coarse file:</p>
               <p>"If I'm good on <emph>cows</emph>, Bob Everett, I don't see why I couldn't cure a
                     <emph>jackass</emph>."</p>
               <p>Everett turned a shade paler than he was before, and to turn off the matter,
                  said:</p>
               <p>"I ve got a head-ache this morning, sir, and speak without thinking what I say.
                  What are you doing there, doctor?"</p>
               <p>Preserving a specimen. Don't consider it personal, though, when alive, the animal
                  did look a good deal like you," snarled the doctor, drawing the door of his
                  state-room too again.</p>
               <p>"Well put, but I suppose I deserved it," said Everett, trying to laugh, but it was
                  a feeble effort.</p>
               <p>"I wish to have a little serious talk with you Mr. Everett," said Clarence,
                  kindly, but with a grave look and tone. "Of late you seem to have lost all taste
                  for duty on board, and to have a constant desire to be on shore. You have also
                  used a very large sum of money, and, as a friend, and one who owes so much to your
                  father for his kindness to me from boyhood <choice>

                     <corr>up</corr>
                  </choice>, I feel it a duty to speak words of caution to you. These Spaniards are
                  professed gamblers, and adepts at cheating, or a majority of them are. At a monte
                  table you would have no chance of winning, unless they allowed you to win a small
                  stake, to draw you into risking a larger one."</p>
               <p>"I do not gamble now, sir, nor have I risked one cent at cards since I have been
                  in Havana," said Everett, rather tartly, for he did not like to be lectured by any
                  one, much less a person whom he had always looked upon as so far beneath him.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you may think that I have no right to know how you have expended such
                  large sums of money," said Captain <choice>
                     <sic>Rhrett</sic>
                     <corr>Rhett</corr>
                  </choice>. "If I did not feel a deep interest in you, sir, for the sake of those
                  you left at home, I should make no allusion to these matters, and, if you went to
                  ruin, let you go in your own way. But I take the liberty, as a friend, a true
                  friend to your interests."</p>
               <p>"My interests can take care of themselves, Captain Rhett," said Everett, beginning
                  to show signs of anger.</p>
               <p>"They shall have my aid, sir, if necessity occurs," said Rhett firmly, but
                  dispassionately. "If you have not gambled your money away, I fear that you have
                  been entrapped by some painted harlot, whose cunning has been too great for your
                  good sense or judgement."</p>
               <p>"It is false, sir, false as hell!" cried Everett, now utterly beside himself with
                  anger. "I know but one female in Havana, and she is as pure as an angel, and ten
                  times as beautiful."</p>
               <p>"And has this pure and beautiful creature been the recipient of the jewelry, which
                  you told me you had been purchasing for your sister?" asked Rhett, not at all
                  excited.</p>
               <p>"Captain Rhett, it is none of your cursed business!" cried Everett, rising to his
                  feet. You can make what presents you choose to my sister, if you ever see her
                  again, which I doubt most infernally. I will do the same."</p>
               <p>"Why do you doubt that I will ever see your sister again?" asked Rhett, fixing his
                  eyes sternly upon the flushed face of the young man.</p>
               <p>Everett saw, in an instant, that he had gone too far, and his face turned white
                  with the fear that his plans were more than suspected.</p>
               <p>"I meant, sir," he replied in a much more respectful tone, that privateering,
                  where a captain is as brave as you are, is a very risky thing, and that if you, or
                  any of us, ever get back to Salem, it will be a wonder."</p>
               <p>"I accept that as your meaning, sir," said Rhett gravely, 'but if, in reality, you
                  have any other meaning, you can understand that I am always on the lookout for
                  treachery, and ready to meet and to punish it. I have been warned of attempts to
                  create disaffection on board this vessel. Such attempts will only recoil with
                  terrible force on those who make them. For mutineers I have yard arms convenient,
                  and I should not hesitate to use them. I am not angry with you, disrespectful as
                  your language has been to me this morning; therefore when I tell you that I had
                  decided, before you came on board, to cut short your visits ashore, you must not

               <p>"Not allow me to go on shore again, sir? Is that what I understand you to say?"
                  said Everett, astonished.</p>
               <p>"Yes sir—not unless I know your reasons for wishing to go, and consider them
                  imperative in their necessity."</p>
               <p>"I will resign my position on your vessel at once, sir, and leave her," cried
                  Everett angrily.</p>
               <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6960-00000038"/>
               <p>"That I cannot permit you to do," replied Clarence. "You must remember you signed
                  the articles of this vessel, just the same as every seaman on board, and those
                  articles bind you to remain in her until we return so Salem, and are there
                  regularly discharged. Without my consent you will not leave this vessel before her
                  cruise is out!"</p>
               <p>"You'll be cursed glad to give that consent!" cried Everett. "I am a tiger, sir,
                  when I am aroused."</p>
               <p>"And I am a tiger tamer, Mr Everett; and if you show any tigerish freaks, I will
                  put you in double irons, just as quickly as I would a man before the mast."</p>
               <p>"Me in irons—me, sir, Robert Everett. the son of the owner of this <choice>
                     <sic>vessell</sic>

                  </choice>?"</p>
               <p>"The half owner, Mr. Robert Everett; and no matter who owns her, I am her
                  commander, and while I live, I will be respected and obeyed as such. Now, sir, you
                  will consider yourself under arrest, and if you make any attempt to go on shore,
                  you shall be confined to your state-room. Then, if you do not act like a gentleman
                  and officer, you shall be ironed as sure as I live and breathe."</p>
               <p>"Very well, sir—very well. You have me under your thumb now, but this will not
                  last long," cried Everett, turning on his heel and going to his state-room.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Cromwell, you will give orders to the forward officer on watch, that Mr.
                  Everett is on no account to be allowed to enter a boat alongside, inform them all
                  that he will not do duty on board untill further orders."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," said the first mate. I came into the cabin just in time to hear his
                  mutinous language, and I only wonder that you have been so patient with him."</p>
               <p>"Patience is a virtue which I so often have to exercise," said Clarence, with a
                  smile. "The young man is hot headed and has been spoiled by over-indulgence. Time
                  and reflection will show him how wrong he has been, and he will regret his <choice>
                     <sic>impndence</sic>
                     <corr>impudence</corr>
                  </choice>. But keep your eye on him, sir, as I shall do."</p>
               <p>"I will, sir, and if I see him communicating with any of the crew, they are marked
                  men. He might try to excite sympathy in some of them, you know."</p>
               <p>"It will be useless for him to try it. By the way, Mr. Cromwell, has our
                  Chronometer been rated <choice>
                     <sic>siuce</sic>

                  </choice> we came into port?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir,—I intended to speak to you about it this morning," replied the mate.</p>
               <p>"Then, you had better take it on shore to the arsenal yard, and rate it. The
                  sailing master there will aid you in taking your sights. He offered to do so you
                  know."</p>
               <p>Cromwell made no reply, but went at once to perform the duty.</p>
               <p>Clarence then took up the log-slate, which had been brought down to him, and
                  transferred the log of the last twenty-four hours to the log-book. For he always
                  kept the ship's log himself.</p>
               <p>While he was thus engaged, Robert Everett came out from his state-room, and in a
                  tone, and with a manner, altered in the most astonishing degree from his late
                  passionate style, he said:</p>
               <p>"I beg your pardon, Captain Rhett, for using such disrespectful language as I did.
                  But I have the devil's own temper, without any command over it. You have been
                  perfectly just in putting me under arrest, and I shall bend to it in the most
                  uncomplaining manner. But I have one favor to ask."</p>
               <p>"Name it, sir," said Clarence quietly.</p>
               <p>"You were right in supposing that the charms of the lady, whom I alluded to, on
                  shore, had quite bewitched me. But, sir, I now feel, if I see her no more, that I
                  can break from her without difficulty. I wish to write to her, to say that I shall
                  not see her again. Will you allow my letter to be sent on shore, if I do so?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, Mr. Everett. No reasonable request of yours will ever be denied."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Captain Rhett,. I will write it."</p>
               <p>And the wily hypocrite went back to his state room to prepare a letter, by which
                  Don Francisco and Captain Martinez would understand his powerless position; for he
                  had overheard the first mate say, that any of the crew whom he communicated with
                  would be marked men, and as he had not yet told Otis or Bascomb of the work which
                  he had laid out for them, he knew he could not do it now. Therefore in language so
                  guarded that it could only be understood by them, he told the Spaniards that they
                  must carry out the work of assassination themselves, and that, only by the death
                  of the Captain and first mate, could he be liberated from his unpleasant position.
                  He knew that the honor of Clarence Rhett was such, that the letter would not be
                  perused by him if it was sent unsealed; but he sealed it, and directed it to La
                  Senora Carolina, number—, Calle del Rey, knowing that its contents would speedily
                  reach those for whom it was specially meant.</p>
               <p>This note he handed to Captain Rhett, who at once had a boat called away, and sent
                  it on shore.</p>
               <p>There was a fiendish smile on the face of Robert Everett, as he re-entered his
                  state room.</p>
               <p>"Clarence Rhett has signed his own death-warrant ashore! he muttered to himself
                  "Before another sun-rise, this brig will be under my command, and La Be la
                  Carolina, too, will be mine; An Clarence Rhett will be where Nellie Everett may
                  follow him for all I care for she alone stands between me and the richest heritage
                  in my native state. She does not love me, nor I her; so I care not what agony his
                  death may bring upon her."</p>

               <p>NOTHING more occurred during the day when Robert Everett was put under arrest, to
                  excite the suspicions, or trouble the mind of Clarence Rhett, or of Cromwell. The
                  latter, after getting the brig's chromomter regulated came on board, and during
                  the afternoon exercised the men as usual, at quarters. When night set in, or
                  rather before it, at sun-set, the men were mustered and inspected as was
                  customary, and then all but the regular harbor-watch were piped down.</p>
               <p>A couple of hours latter, while the boatswain was keeping the officer watch on
                  deck, a boat came toward the brig from shore, which, on being hailed, answered
                  that a <choice>

                  </choice> from the American Consul to Captain Rhett was on board. The Captain and
                  Cromwell were in the forward Cabin at the time, engaged in playing draughts, with
                  Doctor Fowler watching them while Robert sat at the same table with a book in his
                  hand, appearing to be <choice>

                  </choice> interested in it.</p>
               <p>When a man came into the cabin and announced a boat alongside, with a messenger
                  from the Consul. Robert Everett's and trembled so that he could not hold his book,
                  and his heart thumped as if it would beat a passage out of his breast; but his
                  agitation was not observed, for at that moment the game had reached a critical
                  point, and the attention of both the players, as well as the doctor, was fixed on
                  the board.</p>
               <p>Captain Rhett merely told the man to send the consul's messenger down to him, and
                  then made a move which nearly ended the game in his favor, for Cromwell could make
                  but one move more, and that would leave his last piece blocked.</p>
               <p>The Consul's messenger came down a <choice>

                     <corr>moment</corr>
                  </choice> after, just as the game was ended and told Captain Rhett that he had
                  been sent by the consul to tell him, that an American vessel from Boston had just
                  arrived, and had brought letters for him, which were at the Consulate.</p>
               <p>"Why, in heavens name, didn't he send them off to me?" asked the Captain with
                  impatience.</p>
               <p>"It is never his custom to deliver letters, sir, except in person to those to whom
                  they are addressed. They might be too valuable to intrust to a third person. If
                  the Captain will give a written order. I will bring them off to him tonight or in
                  the morning."</p>
               <p>"No, I cannot wait. I will go on shore for them myself. It is not a long walk form
                  the quay to the Consul's house. Will you go with me, Mr. Cromwell?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, Captain Rhett, if you desire it. All is snug on board, and we will not
                  be gone over an hour," replied the first mate.</p>
               <p>"Go on deck and have a boat manned at once. I will go into my room, and get my
                     <emph>derringers</emph>, for I never walk Havana streets at night without my

               <p>The mate went on deck, and the Captain to his room, leaving the messenger for a
                  moment alone with Robert Everett. The Doctor had got up with his pipe in his hand,
                  and gone on deck to smoke, when the game was ended.</p>
               <p>"It will be a long hour before they come back," said the messenger in a whisper,
                  as he turned his lips toward the eye of the second mate. "All is ready on shore.
                  They will not come back, but Don Francisco and Captain Martinez will visit you,
                  when their work on shore is done."</p>
               <p>As he said this the messenger went on deck and returning to his boat shoved off
                  just as the crew of the brig's boat were getting into their seats, preparatory to
                  carrying the Captain and his mate on shore.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXVI.</head>
               <p>WHEN Captain Rhett left the cabin, and when, a few moments after, he heard the
                  splash of the boats oars from the cabin window, Robert Everett could no longer sit
                  still in his chair. He threw down his book, and rising, walked to and fro in the
                  cabin, at every turn looking at the hands of the large marine clock in the after
                  part of the room, and counting the minutes as they were marked by its hands.</p>
               <p>He was pale, and great drops of sweat stole out upon his brow—cold, clammy sweat.
                  His excitement and agitation were terrible. A tragedy was about to be enacted, and
                  though he could not see it, his imagination pictured all its horrors. An hour thus
                  passed, and the doctor came down, drowsy enough to go right to bed without
                  noticing him, for old Joshua had no love for him at any rate. In a little time his
                  snores told that the old surgeon was travelling in the land of dreams.</p>
               <p>An half hour more was gone, and still, with a wild and frightened look, Robert
                  Everett paced to and fro in the cabin of the Cloud-rift.</p>
               <p>"It must be done before this time," he muttered. "Why do those Spaniards delay
                  coming off? I shall go mad with suspense."</p>
               <p>He paused, for he heard the splash of oars, and the watch hailing a boat from the
                  deck. The answer was so low, that he could not distinguish it but he felt certain
                  that Don Francisco and Captain Martinez were the persons who were coming on
                  board.</p>
               <p>He ceased walking, and listening, heard the grating of the boat as she came
                  alongside the brig, and then he heard voices on deck. He was about to go up and
                  see who was there, when the cabin door opened and he saw—not the Spaniards whom he
                  expected, but a face which he had long known, that of Captain Fred Brady.</p>
               <p>The bluff Captain walked into the cabin, followed by a neatly clad boy, at whose
                  face Robert Everett stared as if he was looking at a ghost.</p>
               <p>"How are you, Robert? Your Captain is ashore, I hear," said Captain Fred.</p>
               <p>"Yes, in the devil's name, where did you come from, Captain Brady, and who have
                  you got there?" asked Everett, in surprise.</p>
               <p>"I have just got in from Boston, in the Carrollita, and being told by the pilot
                  that the Cloud-rift laid here, came aboard with letters for Captain Rhett. And
                  this boy, Clarence, here, is one of the smartest cabin-boys you ever saw. He
                  insisted on coming aboard with me, and he has been too good help on the voyage,
                  for me to refuse him so small a favor as that. When will Captain Rhett be on
                  board?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know now, but soon shall," said Everett, whose quick ear had heard
                  another boat approaching the vessel.</p>
               <p>"Well, I shall wait till I see him, for I have letters for him from your father,"
                  said Captain Fred. "Sit down, Clarence, we're in no hurry, are we?"</p>
               <p>The sound of persons talking on deck, and approaching the cabin, now occupied all
                  the attention of Everett; and the next moment Don Francisco and Captain Martinez
                  entered the cabin.</p>
               <p>"Good evening, Captain Everett!" said Martinez, with a meaning look.</p>
               <p>"I congratulate you Captain!" said Don Francisco, with a smile.</p>
               <p>"Why, how is this, Bob? They're calling you Captain, when you're only Mate, and
                  you don't set 'em right!" exclaimed Captain Brady.</p>
               <p>"We know who we are speaking to, and who is Captain here," said Martinez, scowling
                  blackly at the Captain. "A man named Clarence Rhett was the Captain, and he had a
                  fellow named Cromwell for a first mate, but they both have stepped out, at a brisk
                  pace, for another and a better world; and Mr. Robert Everett, in the due line of
                  promotion, becomes Captain We called to inform him of the fact, and to
                  congratulate him. "Do you understand the point?"</p>
               <p>"What? Do you mean that Clarence Rhett and his mate are <emph>dead?</emph>" asked
                  Captain Brady, while pale as snow, and gasping for breath, the young cabin boy
                  sprung forward, and looked into the wicked face of the Spaniard, as if to read a
                  reply in its sinister lines before the lips could utter it.</p>
               <p>"Yes—both of them robbed and stabbed in the streets of Havana, replied the
                  Spaniard cooly.</p>
               <p>With a wild, piercing shriek, which in a moment betrayed her sex, <emph>Nellie
                     Everett</emph>, the disguised cabin-boy, fell at the feet of the merciless
                  wretch.</p>
               <p>"My God! It is poor Nellie herself, and all this time I have not known it!" cried
                  Captain Fred, as he jumped forward and raised the poor girl from the deck</p>
               <p>"Yes, it <emph>is</emph> my sister, and the sooner you take her where you brought
                  her from, the better it will be for you, Captain Brady. I want no scenes on board
                  of my vessel. You have pretended that you did not know her, but no such ridiculous
                  story will go down with me. You brought her out to see her paramour. You had
                  better take her on shore to see his body."</p>
               <p>"She can see him without going there, you base villian, if it is <emph>me</emph>
                  you mean," cried a voice at the cabin door at that instant, and Clarence Rhett,
                  supported on either side by a Spanish infantry officer, and followed by a large
                  guard of soldiers, was assisted into the cabin.</p>
               <p>"Diablo! The dead come to life!" cried Martinez, looking aghast upon the pale face
                  of the young Captain. "This is no place for us, Don Francisco."</p>
               <p>And the two Spaniards started to leave the cabin.</p>
               <p>But at a word from one of the Spanish officers, the guard stepped forward, and in
                  a second both Martinez and Francisco were prisoners.</p>
               <p>"What on earth is the matter here?" asked old Dr. Fowler, putting his night-capped
                  head out of his state-room door, for the noise had just awakened him.</p>
               <p>"Come out, and use your skill in recovering this young lady from her faint, and
                  then you may do something for me; for I've had more blood-letting to-night than is
                  good for me," said Clarence.</p>
               <p>"Yes, doctor, make haste!" cried the American Consul, who had brought up the rear
                  of the last party, "for Captain Rhett would not stay on shore for medical aid, and
                  his wounds are not skillfully bandaged."</p>
               <p>"What hurt him?" asked the doctor, coming from his room, robed in an old dressing
                  gown, which made him look more lean than ever.</p>
               <p>"He has been badly stabbed by a gang of hired bravoes, two of whom have fallen
                  under his bullets, and the third got a probe from poor Cromwell, which will end
                  him before another day is gone," said the Consul. "Thank heaven, he had life
                  enough left in him to tell who hired him, and what the plot was. That was to
                  murder two brave men, and place a cowardly assassin in command of this brig, so
                  that she might be transformed into a Spanish Private."</p>
               <p>"Lord—Lord! When will wonders cease!" was the exclamation of Doctor Fowler, as he
                  raised the head of poor Nellie, yet insensible, for the purpose of applying a
                  restorative to her lips.</p>
               <p>Whether the exclamation was caused by the revelation which the Consul had just
                  made, or the discovery that the person who looked so like a boy that not even
                  Captain Brady had penetrated the disguise, was, in truth, a lovely girl,<pb
                     n="78-79 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC6960-00000040"/> whom, in her proper
                  dress, he had so often seen before, was not known then, nor will it probably ever
                  be.</p>
               <p>Nellie, recovering almost as suddenly as she had fainted, under the powerful
                  stimulant which the doctor had used, opened her eyes upon Clarence Rhett, who yet
                  stood before her.</p>
               <p>"He is not dead! He is not dead!" she cried, and she fainted again—this time for
                  joy, and not in agony.</p>
               <p>In a few moments she again became conscious, and then, with her hand resting in
                  that of Clarence Rhett, while Dr. Fowler dressed his wound, she heard the tale of
                  treachery which had cost poor Cromwell his life, and had so nearly taken Clarence
                  Rhett from her.</p>
               <p>Captain Brady was a listener, and so, because he could not help it, guarded by the
                  Spanish soldiers, was her wretched brother.</p>
               <p>After the Captain's wound had been dressed, the cabin was mostly cleared, for the
                  Spanish officers, with the guard, took three prisoners on shore to be held for
                  trial; the two Spaniards not alone for this last crime but for piracy, for they
                  had been recognized as criminals, who, under a cunning disguise, had long evaded
                  the <choice>
                     <sic>pursult</sic>
                     <corr>pursuit</corr>
                  </choice> of justice.</p>
               <p>At the request of Clarence, the Consul and Captain Brady, remained on board during
                  the night.</p>
               <p>The next day, a most agreeable surprise came to increase yet further, the
                  happiness of Clarence Rhett and Nellie Everett.</p>
               <p>It was the arrival of a second vessel from Boston, a fast schooner that had been
                  specially chartered by the father of Nellie, who, finding that she had got a-head
                  of him, in her desperate resolve to warn her lover of the danger which she had
                  dreamed of, had chartered a vessel to follow the Carollita to Havana, that he
                  might regain the child whom he loved better than his life.</p>
               <p>It was a joyful meeting, that of father and child, and with Clarence too, saddened
                  only by the thought, that Robert Everett was such an utterly lost and desperate
                  villain.</p>
               <p>The old merchant and Nellie, once more assuming the dress which made her beauty so
                  perfect, now took up quarters on board the Cloud-rift, which shortly afterwards
                  sailed for Salem.</p>
               <p>Before she left Havana, however, the Chaplain of an American frigate which came
                  into port, had made the two young folks, one in name, as they were one in
                  heart.</p>
               <p>Mr. Everett left his son to be dealt with by Spanish law, the most severe in the
                  world in cases like that. Some time afterwards a rumor reached him, that Robert
                  and the two Spaniards had escaped from prison before trial. If the rumor was true,
                  the reader will learn of it in a sequel to this work, for it would not do to leave
                  such a trio of unmitigated scoundrels drifting around the world. But of the
                  Cloudrift, and her first eventful cruise, this narrative is all on record, and we
                  cheerfully announce of it,</p>

               <p>Of this latest production of this talented authoress, we can only say, that like
                  her previous works, it is a pleasing and delightful romance, a book of charming
                  sentiment and refined taste, and presenting a lively and agreeable picture of
                  female character.—<title>N. Y. Dispatch.</title>
               </p>
               <p>A production that does honor alike to the principles and genius of the authoress.
                  By its refinement and delicacy of sentiment, and its admirable life lessons, it is

                  of "Castles is the Air." In none of her tales has this clever whiter displayed
                  more of that keen perception of character and close power of delineation which so
                  eminently characterize her. MR. BRADY has done our novel-reading public a service
                  in presenting them with this reissue.—<title>N. Y. Herald.</title>

               <p>A novel from the pen of MRS. GORE needs no praise to commend it to the reading

               </p>
               <p>This is a well-written story. Wit and wisdom sparkle through its fascinating
                  pages. It will be perused with more than ordinary interest. A moral of practical

               <head>Too Old a Bird to be Caught with Chaff.—Price 50 Cents.</head>
               <p>This work is written with all the vigor that distinguishes this lady from the many
                  common-place writers of the day. The story is pleasantly told, and carried on its
                  even tenor in a manner that will please those who love to find in a novel that
                  regard for the unities and tastefulness in style so much to be prized by a writer
                  who would seek public applause.—<title>Home Journal.</title>
               </p>
               <p>We do not know that MRS. GORE has penned a novel superior to this. The parts are
                  clever and lively, contrast well with certain touches of pathos and scenes wrought
                  up with great feeling: and the characters, though not altogether new, exhibit
                  features of sufficient originality to entitle even those in fashionable life to be
                  considered as very able impersonations. <title>Legal Intelligencer.</title>

               <head>The Dowager.—Price 50 Cents.</head>
               <p>The book is very sprightly, and the satire clever and amusing. The characters are
                  well drawn, and MRS. GORE'S experience has produced a most readable
                     novel.—<title>Phila. City Item.</title>
               </p>
               <p>MRS. GORE'S stories are distinguished for their advocacy of some prominent virtue
                  of practical life, or a keen rebuke of vices calculated to injure the peace of
                  society. It is an admirable picture of modern manners in the higher classes of
                  society. The author's style is easy and lively. This latest of her productions

               <head>Percy; or, Fortune's Frolics.—Price 50 Cts.</head>
               <p>This novel is written with positive power. It may be called a highly-colored
                  photograph of English society in our own time. This book will be remembered by the
                  reader as standing out in strong relief from the dull mess of novels made in this
                  scribbling day.—<title>Legal Intelligencer.</title>
               </p>
               <p>MRS. GORE'S novels are familiar to almost every household. They are both moral and
                  high toned, and the virtues with which her heroes and heroines are invested are
                  good examples for wayward youth.—<title>N. Y. Dispatch.</title>
               </p>
               <p>This work has received high praise from the London critics, who pronounce it "the

               <p>This is a story of life in India, in the East India Company's service, of which
                  the author has evidently had some experience. It is a story in which domestic life
                  in the East, and spicy adventures, are interestingly blended, and it is a book
                  that will gratify and well repay perusal. <title>Brooklyn Daily Eagle.</title>
