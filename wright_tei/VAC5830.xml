                  <head type="sub">THE CASTLE IN DEBT.</head>
                  <p>Ravelwild is a lovely and picturesque station on the Erie Railroad, where the snorting engine pauses a moment to drop a way passenger from the train, and glides off into the deep gorge of dark hollow.</p>
                  <p>A half mile beyond the depot lay at the date of our narrative the farm of Dorrance Cruger.</p>
                  <p>The homestead stood on a gentle eminence commanding a romantic view of the wild and gorgeous scenery peculiar to this section of New York State; not a hundred yards away, a creek tumbled in scenic beauty over the rocks, forming innumerable miniature cascades, and a row of fine shade trees in front of the dwelling added to the natural beauty of its surroundings.</p>
                  <p>The house was by no means an ordinary one, having been constructed by its former owner, an eccentric knickerbocker, as an architectural representation of the old feudal type, and in spite of a very modern piazza and the absence of moat, drawbridge and portcullis, it got to be styled in time "the Castle."</p>
                  <p>Dorrance Cruger was a hard-working and apparently a prosperous farmer, but in early life he had been tempted into ruinous speculations, and the property had become heavily mortgaged. While his less industrious neighbors envied his fine crops and flowing fields of grain, he closely resembled a certain ancient gentleman whom history has recorded as having a sword suspended over his head, and whose appetite failed him in consequence.</p>
                  <p>One pleasant afternoon in August, 18—, which, by an odd coincidence, is precisely the day our story commences, Mr. Cruger was sitting in his arm chair on the piazza puffing his pipe in a very thoughtful mood.</p>
                  <p>"Three thousand dollars," he muttered bitterly to himself, "is the sum and substance of my misery! mortgage foreclosed in two weeks from to-morrow; Stella and myself will be then houseless, homeless, and beggars!"</p>
                  <p>Dorrance Cruger's brow grew darker as his mind reverted to his daughter; she was the only surviving relative he possessed in the world, the only thing besides his dog Neptune, whom he loved or who felt a kindred attachment towards himself. Stella was the pride and solace of his life; to associate her with penury seemed worse than death itself.</p>
                  <p>"She has not yet heard the sad truth," continued Dorrance, nodding to himself. "The blow will fall all the heavier; though I have hugged the secret so long in my breast, she must know it at last. Poor Stella, what will become of you, my darling?"</p>
                  <p>The farmer sighed and mechanically rose from his seat; he took two or three turns on the piazza with a half distracted air, unconscious that a chaise in the meanwhile had driven up to the gate, the driver of which had already alighted, and was now busy tying his horse to one of the shade trees.</p>
                  <p>The stranger, a young man, evidently about twenty-two years of age, with small grey eyes and a cunning, shrewd expression of countenance, having completed the task of securing his horse, rapped on the fence, using the butt end of his whip to attract the farmer's attention.</p>
                  <p>"Halloo you, Cruger," he shouted in an insolent tone.</p>
                  <p>"I beg pardon," said Dorrance starting; "Oh, Mr. Cramp, I'm glad to see you."</p>
                  <p>"No you ain't," retorted the young gentleman, giving the gate an impatient swing, as he forthwith entered. "No, no, old fellow; I ain't fool enough to believe that; to tell the truth, when I'm after a man, in a business way, I don't look for a very hearty welcome. You know what I came for?"</p>
                  <p>Dorrance's face turned slightly pale, and<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC5830-00000004"/> expressed the instant reply that he was well aware of the nature of his visitor's errand; whereupon Mr. Cramp walked deliberately up the steps, ensconced himself comfortably in the farmer's arm-chair, and lit a cigar.</p>
                  <p>"You did'nt expect me quite so soon, eh?" inquired the young gentleman, puffing vigorously at his havana.</p>
                  <p>"Not before the two weeks were up," rejoined Dorrance half sullenly.</p>
                  <p>"Good enough," replied Mr. Cramp. "Ready to pay me the money yet on this tumble-down tenement?"</p>
                  <p>"No," replied Dorrance, shaking his head sorrowfully; "you know that too well, Mr. Cramp."</p>
                  <p>"Nor ever will be," added the visitor, crossing his logs in evident enjoyment. The farmer covered his face in his hands and made no reply.</p>
                  <p>"This is a devilish nice lawn," remarked the young gentleman, complacently turning from his unfortunate debtor to contemplate the rich carpet of velvety green. "By thunder, the place will make a capital summer residence for me, especially when those clumsy trees have been cut down."</p>
                  <p>"Don't do it, Mr. Cramp, you'll spoil your place, rob it of half its beauty," interposed Dorrance with some warmth.</p>
                  <p>"Will it, oh, will it?" retorted Mr. Cramp insolently. "Now look here, old fellow; I don't want you to sing to me the stale old song of 'Woodman, spare that tree,' for I shan't spare it. I'll chop the whole lot of 'em down; so save your breath—suppose we take a look inside."</p>
                  <p>Dorrance Cruger sighed and without a word obeyed the master spirit, and followed him into the parlor.</p>
                  <p>It was a pleasant room for a farmer's house, not closed up like most parlors in the country, to be opened on special occasions, but a little cosy box with a green baize carpet, six stuffed arm-chairs, a writing desk and a small library of books, together with Stella's cabinet of curiosities, comprising shells, bits of quartz, birds' nests, and her sketch-book.</p>
                  <p>Young Cramp had often been in this parlor before, and seemed, on the present occasion, to be influenced by a species of malicious pleasure in renewing a general inspection of the furniture.</p>
                  <p>"Ugh!" he ejaculated, pointing to several plainly framed pictures in oil colors which decorated the walls. "I'm sick of looking at those miserable daubs; thank gracious, they won't hang here much longer."</p>
                  <p>"Those pictures," replied Dorrance, a hectic of a moment brightening his cheek, "were drawn by my dear, lost wife. I value them above gold."</p>
                  <p>"I have no doubt <emph>you</emph> value 'em; nobody else does, though," sneered Cramp. "They ain't worth the frames that hold 'em."</p>
                  <p>"Say another word about those pictures, and I'll knock your head off!" retorted Dorrance, firing up.</p>
                  <p>"Ho, ho, ho! Cruger, don't get mad," returned the young gentleman, stepping backward with a deprecating face, as the fierce, blazing eye of the farmer met his. "By thunder I did'nt know I was saying anything wrong; besides, it won't do for you to be working yourself in a passion with me: I can do you some harm, you know, and maybe some good; now look here, to come to business, your furniture has got to go under the hammer, ain't it?"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cruger doggedly nodded an affirmative.</p>
                  <p>"Well, then," pursued Mr. Cramp, "you ought to know what country vendues are; they are all well attended it is true; but half the people come out of curiosity, and the other half expect to get the goods nominally for nothing. How much will your traps fetch? not a straw—at most you won't realize a hundredth part of their value, they are sure to be sacrificed. So now, if you don't want to be a beggar outright you'll be more civil to me. I tell you what, Cruge, old chap, I ain't your enemy though you may think me one; come,—I'll make you a splendid offer!"</p>
                  <p>"An offer!" repeated the farmer, surprised at the turn their conversation had taken. "What do you mean, Mr. Cramp?"</p>
                  <p>The young gentleman settled himself in an easy chair by the window, where he could occasionally glance at his horse and chaise, and proceeded:</p>
                  <p>"I'll tell you what I mean, it's an offer that don't turn up every day to a poor fellow like you. You think me a close, crabbed man, at least the world thinks me so, but I can do a clever thing when it suits me. Now Cruge, you have a daughter, quite a smart girl—by the by, how old is she?"</p>
                  <p>"Sixteen years next October."</p>
                  <p>"She looks younger; never mind, she is old enough to work. To come to the point, I don't mind making her my housekeeper."</p>
                  <p>"Your housekeeper!" echoed the father, with an involuntary start. "Your housekeeper indeed!"</p>
                  <p>"Listen to me," pursued Cramp, leaning back in his chair like a man who feels himself sure of carrying his point. "I've got it into my head to buy your furniture off your hands at a liberal figure, then everything can remain just as it is now; those daubs,—I beg pardon, those pictures—yonder may hang where they are until doomsday if you wish; the trees shan't be disturbed, or the house altered, and to insure this I merely stipulate that"—</p>
                  <p>"Well," rejoined Dorrance, as young Cramp paused to give more emphasis to the concluding sentence.</p>
                  <p>"That you shall remain here with your daughter and keep bachelor's hall for me. During the cold spell my business will require my attendance in town. You and your daughter may retain the farm in the meanwhile free of rent; so now, what do you think of it?"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Dorrance Cruger was confounded at this offer at once so generous and apparently disinterested; he was no match for the crafty young usurer, and was far from suspecting sinister designs.</p>
                  <p>"Come, what do you think of it?" repeated Hardy Cramp, impatiently, as the old man remained silent.</p>
                  <p>"I hardly know what to say,—your offer is fair—very fair. I certainly have no objection; but Stella might not fancy the arrangement."</p>
                  <p>"Don't make a fool of yourself, Cruge," replied the young gentleman with a slight sneer. "Now I can tell you what's in your mind; you think I have an object in all this; of course I have. I want this property taken care of. I want to be friendly to you, and I want to make this house my summer residence. The girl will have sense enough to know which side her bread is buttered, as well as you. If the offer meets with <emph>your</emph> approbation, why, all right then."</p>
                  <p>"I am not quite sure of that," returned the farmer, gravely shaking his head. "Stella has been greatly indulged by me; she is as yet unaware of the transfer of the property, and might raise very serious objections."</p>
                  <p>"It isn't necessary to ask her opinion in the matter at all. Tell her you've made up your mind and she will then cave in,—number one is what you are to look after; remember that!"</p>
                  <p>Having uttered this bit of worldly advice in a threatening, bullying tone, young Cramp glanced at his watch. "By thunder," he added, "it's half-past five; I've got ten minutes, just, to reach the railroad station."</p>
                  <p>The young usurer rose from his chair, and, snatching up his whip, was about to leave, when, with a merry exclamation, in rushed Stella holding up before her father a pretty scarf of brilliant crimson.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cruger patted his daughter's check affectionately as she flung the scarf round his neck.</p>
                  <p>"Where did you get this Stella, dear?"</p>
                  <p>"It dropped from the skies," replied Stella laughing, "or rather it came whirling at my feet as the express train passed. Niger Burse says it belongs to me, unless some one appears to claim it, which is not at all likely; but let me tell you the whole," continued Stella, glowing with enthusiasm. "Burse says it is a good omen, and—"</p>
                  <p>Stella paused and colored with vexation as she perceived for the first time the presence of Hardy Cramp, who was gazing at her in great admiration.</p>
                  <p>Stella was quite small for her years; her eyes of a beautiful soft hazel, and a profusion of brown curly hair swept unfettered down her pretty neck; her face, though tanned by frequent exposure to the sun, was very handsome, and expressed a gentle, yet firm disposition.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Cramp," said the former, turning to the young usurer, "this is my daughter Stella."</p>
                  <p>"We have met before," spoke the young lady, slowly and distinctly, as she turned her eyes upon the stranger.</p>
                  <p>"Of course we have," laughed Hardy, coloring, with an odd expression of guilt on his smooth face. "I have often seen you, Miss, flitting around like a fairy, hereabouts, but we never spoke before, I think."</p>
                  <p>"I believe you are mistaken," replied Stella, quietly; "we met by the railroad crossing, and, as I remember, you put your arm round my waist and endeavored to kiss me; and I believe," she added naively, "a certain friend of mine resented the insult by knocking your hat off."</p>
                  <p>"You've got hold of somebody else," returned Hardy Cramp, frowning slightly as his eyes fell before her steadfast gaze. "Come, Miss Stella, you ain't going to catechise me in this fashion. Suppose I did meet you? suppose I begged a kiss? what<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC5830-00000005"/> then? pshaw! you are nothing but a child!"</p>
                  <p>"I do not let any one kiss me, if I am a child, especially if I don't fancy them," replied Stella, shrinking back with marked aversion, as young Cramp approached nearer.</p>
                  <p>"Ho, ho, ho! that ain't bad," laughed the young usurer. "I like to see them airs; it just suits me. You'll make somebody a smart housekeeper, I fancy,—<emph>by thunder, it is time I was off!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>Giving another glance at his watch, and muttering "only five minutes left to catch those confounded cars," Mr. Cramp set his long legs in motion, leaped in his chaise, whipped up his horse, and several minutes thereafter, was seen by Burse, the flag-man, tearing at a break-neck pace by the railroad crossing, just in season to meet the Mail train, which stops two minutes at Ravelwild Station.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE CASTLE TRIES TO COMPROMISE.</head>
                  <p>Stella was right; she had met young Hardy Cramp before. He had caught sight of her handsome face, as he was riding over to the Castle, and rudely attempted to kiss the indignant young beauty, a piece of presumption that was rewarded by a rough blow from Burse, the sturdy flag-man of the Station.</p>
                  <p>Hardy, like all young gentlemen of his stamp who encounter opposition, fell violently in love with Stella, and inwardly resolved to possess her by fair or foul means. It was in prosecution of this selfish purpose that brought him to the Castle, and influenced his mean and sordid soul to wear the outward seeming of kindly feeling and generosity toward his debtor.</p>
                  <p>When Dorrance Cruger heard the story from the lips of Stella, he only laughed. "You are prejudiced against young Cramp, I perceive."</p>
                  <p>"I dislike him ever so much," repeated Stella. "Ever so much."</p>
                  <p>I see it plainly," replied Mr. Cruger. "I will admit he is rough and coarse in his manners, though he has a kind heart. He is a person of some influence, and is capable of doing us a great deal of good—I will add, plenty of harm. Stella, you do not know the power he exercises over your unfortunate father—you little dream that he holds our happiness in his hands."</p>
                  <p>"I know it all,—I have long suspected the true condition of affairs," replied Stella, with much feeling.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cruger looked astonished.</p>
                  <p>"How did you find out?" he asked, knitting his brows. "Have you been a naughty eavesdropper?"</p>
                  <p>"Forgive me, dear father, if I plead guilty," murmured Stella, a slight color suffusing her cheeks as she spoke. "One day Mr. Cramp and yourself were talking on the porch; his voice was loud and angry, and I stopped in the passage-way to discover the cause; then I heard all; then I knew the Castle, the pretty flowers, the pleasant shade trees, must be surrendered to him; then I knew we were to be wanderers on the wide world."</p>
                  <p>"And knowing this," said Mr. Cruger, bitterly, "you allow yourself to be carried away by strong prejudices against the very man who could prevent it. Young Cramp has made us a generous offer, he permits us to remain here and allows me the control and use of the farm on the condition you become his housekeeper."</p>
                  <p>Stella's lovely face expressed the workings of her thoughts. It was proud and disdainful.</p>
                  <p>"Do not ask me to live in the society of that man," she answered resolutely. "If you really knew him as I know him, you would not suffer him in our presence. If the Castle belongs to him, leave it; seek your fortune elsewhere. It is better to be beggars than eat the crumbs from Hardy Cramp's table."</p>
                  <p>The farmer gazed steadfastly at his daughter, with mingled emotions of surprise, affection, and pride; all the dignity and firmness of womanhood seemed united in her at that instant. It made her will law.</p>
                  <p>"It shall be as you wish, my darling," he replied, "though I must confess you have unjust prejudices against him."</p>
                  <p>That same afternoon the farmer wrote a letter to the young broker and advised him of his daughter's resolution: "The arrangement proposed by you, meets with such opposition on her part that I deem it proper to decline."</p>
                  <p>Hardy Cramp, who was shrewd and calculating, though not much used to driving bargains in love, was thrown in a tempest of wrath by the reception of this unwelcome note. He had woven a web for pretty Stella and had failed to entangle her. He was determined, however, to carry his point if it cost him money; so when he had composed himself the young villain set to work hatching a new plot, with what success will hereafter appear.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                  <head type="sub">STELLA CONSULTS A LEGAL GENTLEMAN OF PROFOUND ATTAINMENTS.</head>
                  <p>It was a sad reflection to poor Stella that the Castle in a short fortnight must pass from their hands; her little head had busied itself long before in various fanciful schemes of releasing her father from his entanglements,—mortgages and foreclosures were rather difficult subjects to be disposed of in the ordinary way, and to clear the thorny path she had recourse to her staunch friend, Burse the flag-man, who was ever ready when required to impart his legal advice.</p>
                  <p>Niger Burse in his younger days had been servant to a city lawyer, and while in his employ acquired an extensive smattering of law phrases and legal matters which he worked up according to his own ideas without much respect for Blackstone or Kent.</p>
                  <p>Stella stood in great a we of Burso's knowledge—circumstances had made him a flagman, his genius evidently designed him for a lawyer,—at least, so thought Stella. The old flag-man was well pleased by her frequent complimentary allusions to his legal ability, and labored hard to deserve it.</p>
                  <p>When Stella had doubts and misgivings respecting the meaning of the terms mortgage and foreclosure, Burse had come to her aid and rendered her good service with his characteristic explanations. "An mortgage, Miss, is a kind of paper wot gets a chap in trouble, and a foreclosure is a sort of closen up and circumwenting him; of the two vuns, Miss, 'pears to me I'd mostly prefer the mortgage, though neither on 'em comes just handy to any vun."</p>
                  <p>It was to Burse the young girl betook her way the following morning. The old flagman of Ravelwild dwelt in an ancient log cabin, near the railroad crossing; a tattered red flag hung at the doorway as though a perpetual auction was going on inside. Burse was a peculiar gentleman, of eccentric tastes and secluded habits; dressed usually in a dirty pair of overalls and a pea jacket, with an old straw hat perched on the back of his head, which he wore, rain or shine, in utter defiance of the changes of season or the mutations of fashion. Burse possessed a good heart, though his face was coarse, his voice rough, and his manners uncouth.</p>
                  <p>The flag-man was sitting outside of the cabin door placidly smoking his clay pipe, when the pretty figure of Stella loomed in sight, her white dress, red scarf and curls fluttering in the breeze. Burse watched her as she approached, with a half grunt of admiration.</p>
                  <p>"She's a handsome vun," he muttered to himself, "but I'm afeard she'll be kidnapped afore long; them handsome gals allers is kidnapped—Vell, Miss Stell, you're down arly this morning to see old Burse. Nothing happened?"</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Cramp was over to the Castle last evening," replied Stella, swinging her gipsy with an uneasy glance at the flag-man.</p>
                  <p>"I knowed it—I saw the chap ven he left—wot come on it?"</p>
                  <p>"He proposed to papa, when we were broken up, to give him the charge of the farm free of rent, in case I consented to act as his housekeeper."</p>
                  <p>"Yar, yar, I understand," rejoined Burse, nodding his head intelligently. "Wot next?"</p>
                  <p>"I suppose you will think me very ungrateful, but I refused to agree to it."</p>
                  <p>"Thar you done right," responded Burse energetically. "Crush my old hat if I'd trust as pretty a vun with thot rascal, young as you be."</p>
                  <p>"I can't express to you," said Stella, laughing and coloring, "how I dislike that man; he's got a terribly evil eye; don't you think so, Burse?"</p>
                  <p>"Yar, I do," replied the old man, cogitatingly knocking the ashes out of his pipe. "Thot's my idee—but wot says your pa?"</p>
                  <p>"Poor papa agrees to every thing I say," spoke the young girl more softly, a tear filling her eye. "Oh, Burse, if we could only think of some plan of preventing this foreclosure, as they call it. Can't you call to mind some way they have in law of putting it off?"</p>
                  <p>"Thot's wot I wos thinking ov," rejoined Burse, looking profound. "Thar is sunthing of the sort in the law books; 'pears to me if he could get out a plea for trespass."</p>
                  <p>"A plea for trespass," repeated Stella, brightening up. "What is it, Burse?"</p>
                  <p>"It's a kind of dockiment to perwent foreclosing the premises," replied the flagman<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC5830-00000006"/> man, whose legal phrases and their direct application had become strangely confused and jumbled together. "Hasn't your pa nary papers <unclear>sotting</unclear> out a plea for trespass?"</p>
                  <p>Stella shook her head; she was quite sure her father had no such valuable documents in his possession.</p>
                  <p>"Then," said Burse, with a disappointed expression, "I dunno as thar is any remedy at law, unless sun'body forks over for your pa, which isn't likely to happen. Wot's the amount of said mortgage?"</p>
                  <p>"Three thousand dollars," replied Stella, unable to repress a sigh.</p>
                  <p>"It's a big lot of money,—though as to the matter of thot, it doesn't signify whether 'tis a big pile or a small vun, seeing it's got to be paid."</p>
                  <p>Having uttered this very profound observation, the old flag-man refilled his pipe with a meditative air.</p>
                  <p>"Many will blame me," said Stella sadly, "because I have refused Mr. Cramp's offer of a home, but I cannot, even for a dear father, sacrifice my self-respect."</p>
                  <p>"You are a plucky gal as I likes to see," enjoined Burse with an approving grunt. "I'm sorry I can't do nothing for ye. Wot a pity your pa hasn't nary papers sotting out a plea for trespass. Thot would fetch thot young raseal, I'm thinking,—but thor's the train coming."</p>
                  <p>Burse snatched his flag, and trotted down to meet the Express, while Stella turned homeward, pondering over the learned advice of her counsel, which, though of no practical value in the present case, confirmed her in the high opinion she had entertained of his legal ability.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
                  <head type="sub">MYSTERIOUS VISITORS AT RAVELWILD.</head>
                  <p>The road leading to the Castle was somewhat hilly and studded on each side with thick groves of pine. The morning was fresh and fair, the sun shone bright, the birds sang and warbled sweetly among the branches. Stella with the impulse of a child turned from her sad reflections to join the song of nature, awakening the echoes of the forest with notes of surpassing sweetness and strength, when she was brought to an abrupt halt by a voice accosting her:</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Well sung, upon my word!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>Stella gave a start of surprise to find that she formed the centre of a group of dark-visaged men who had quickly surrounded her, and were now scrutinizing her with earnest attention. The spokesman of this evil-looking party, who was leaning against a tree, was a tall, handsome-featured man of twenty-five; his black eyes, bronzed complexion and resolute mouth gave index of a character at once bold, reckless and unprincipled; his companions were all muscular, determined-faced desperadoes, but of a coarser and more villainous type.</p>
                  <p>"Bravo!" repeated the leader, as he evidently was, stepping forward with this exclamation of admiration as Stella confronted them with fearless aspect. "Who are you, my pretty bird, and where is your nest?"</p>
                  <p>"My name, sir, is Stella Cruger," replied Stella, with simplicity. "My home is the Castle; if you and your friends are gentlemen you will not further insult an unprotected girl but allow me to proceed."</p>
                  <p>The leader lifted his hat with mock <choice>
                        <sic>politeeness</sic>
                        <corr>politeness</corr>
                     </choice>. "Move aside," he said to his men with an ironical smile, "and let the young lady pass."</p>
                  <p>The fierce gaze of the miscreants was riveted on her, as, in obedience to their chieftain's command, they sullenly fell back and allowed her to go without further interruption. That look caused the blood almost to curdle in Stella's veins with strange horror. She preserved an outward show of composure until a bend in the road hid them from view; then she quickened her steps into a run and reached the Castle in a flutter of agitation.</p>
                  <p>Dorrance Cruger was sitting in his favorite chair on the porch, perusing a letter he had just received. Stella flew up the steps like a frightened fawn.</p>
                  <p>"What has happened now?" inquired Mr. Cruger, his attention momentarily abstracted from the letter to the excited face of his youthful daughter.</p>
                  <p>Very hurriedly and breathlessly Stella related her recent adventure; Mr. Cruger listened in surprise; he had reason, for the circumstance of meeting a dozen strange men in the neighborhood of the Castle was by no means an ordinary event. The route chosen by Stella was off the highway and seldom trod by strangers; even the wandering tramps, who hang around railroad stations, intuitively avoided the wild and unfrequented path to the Castle.</p>
                  <p>"It is very strange," observed Dorrance, thoughtfully, when his daughter had concluded. "I wonder who these fellows may be, and the object of their visit to Ravelwild; perhaps they are sporting men after partridge or quail?"</p>
                  <p>Stella shook her head. She was quite sure they were not.</p>
                  <p>"Gipsies, then?"</p>
                  <p>"No; not gipsies," replied Stella decisively. "They are worse than even gipsies. I can never forget their bad faces, if I live a hundred years."</p>
                  <p>Dorrance did not immediately reply, but gazed meditatively down the road; his thoughts were evidently engrossed on something else, for after an uneasy glance at the letter which he still held open, he said:</p>
                  <p>"Stella, I have just received an <emph>important</emph> note,"—he emphasized it almost unconsciously,—"which makes it necessary for me to visit the City for two or three days; would you feel afraid to remain in the house until I return?" he added, anxiously.</p>
                  <p>"Not if Neptune is to keep me company," answered Stella, gayly. "Here, Nep! come to your mistress."</p>
                  <p>A large black dog, at the call of his name, bounded towards her with a bark of delight, almost overturning her in his rough greeting. He was a powerful and splendid specimen of the Newfoundland breed; his eyes were fierce-looking but intelligent, his motions rapid and agile as an athlete.</p>
                  <p>"You will take care of me while papa is away, good Nep.," said Stella, caressing his rough, shaggy head.</p>
                  <p>The sagacious animal seemed to fully comprehend his young mistress; his speaking eye, and eloquent wag of his tail, expressed the fullest assurance of protection.</p>
                  <p>"A dog like Neptune is a safe-guard to be sure, but you require something else," observed Mr. Cruger, reflectively. "You have been taught the use of a pistol, and you know where it hangs."</p>
                  <p>Stella clapped her hands gleefully and declared with Neptune for a champion and her father's revolver she might safely defy the whole world.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cruger's sad face brightened into a sympathetic smile; the childlike confidence Stella reposed in her favorite was to some extent shared by himself; yet the adventure narrated by his daughter filled him with uneasiness. After pondering a few moments he folded up the letter, put on his hat, and resolutely said:</p>
                  <p>"Stella, get my rifle."</p>
                  <p>"But, father"—</p>
                  <p>"Not a word, Stella, I must find out who these strangers are before I leave you—here Neptune!"</p>
                  <p>Stella knew her father too well to utter another syllable of remonstrance or objection, but ran to bring the rifle and silently handed it to him.</p>
                  <p>Dorrance examined the weapon with the critical eye of a gunsmith; then turning to Neptune, gave a low, peculiar whistle. It was a signal the dog well understood, and had been taught to obey. Like a shot he bounded over the fence, into the road, eagerly snuffing the ground as he went.</p>
                  <p>"He'll find the tracks of those rogues," cried Dorrance, triumphantly, "if they be in the neighborhood of the Castle; now, Stella, keep snug and quiet as a dormouse until I return."</p>
                  <p>So saying, the farmer slung his rifle over his shoulder in huntsman fashion, and trudged along several yards behind Neptune, who was darting here and there with the restlessness of a dog off the scent. Upon reaching the bend of the road where Stella encountered the ruffians, Neptune's whole bearing changed; he uttered a significant growl, and darted obliquely in the woods on a newly discovered trail; Dorrance closely followed him; the sagacious animal, his nose close to the ground, pursued a devious way through tangled, intricate masses of briar and shrubbery, terminating at last on the railroad track; here the dog appeared to lose the scent, rushing up and down distracted and evidently baffled.</p>
                  <p>Dorrance Cruger paused; leaning on his rifle he watched the eccentric movements of Neptune with curious interest. Keen-scented as any hunter, the animal for once seemed certainly at fault.</p>
                  <p>"You've lost the trail, old fellow," said Dorrance, calling him to his side and affectionately patting him. "They are gone, at all events."</p>
                  <p>Near where he stood a couple of stakes were driven into the earth, and further on, a few paces from the railroad track, Mr. Cruger observed a crow-bar.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, ho!" soliloquized the farmer, a sudden thought suggesting a new idea. "I understand now; a gang of men are at work on the railroad, and Stella stumbled in their way as they were knocking around; she naturally mistook these rough follows for robbers and murderers."</p>
                  <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC5830-00000007"/>
                  <p>Having arrived at this satisfactory conclusion, Mr. Cruger was about to retrace his steps homeward, when the shrill whistle of an approaching engine broke the stillness and monotony of the forest; the express train swept by like a whirlwind—quivering slightly as it passed a narrow embankment looking down a frightful abyss of seventy feet. This chasm was known by the country people as the "Devil's Gap", and regarded by them as a dangerous spot.</p>
                  <p>Dorrance experienced a sensation of relief as the cars disappeared round the curve, for he had noticed their strange vibration which was by no means a common occurrence; if he had taken the trouble to investigate the cause he would have been both astonished and appalled, but at this moment his attention was directed to the strange conduct of Neptune.</p>
                  <p>That sagacious animal had resumed his search of the missing trail, and was snuffing the ground near a large pine tree; he had made a circle round the tree, when his master whistled him back. Never had the Newfoundland shown a more refractory spirit; he obeyed sullenly, growling savagely.</p>
                  <p>At any other time Dorrance might have suspected something wrong; but, secure in his theory, he carelessly shouldered his rifle and turned back to the Castle, followed by his faithful dog still growling ominously.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE CONSPIRATORS.</head>
                  <p>Scarcely had the farmer disappeared round the railroad curve, before two men cautiously descended from a huge pine tree. The tallest was a dark-eyed handsome-featured man whom the reader will recognize as the leader of the ruffians encountered by Stella that eventful morning. His companion was a short, thick set desperado, with bushy eyebrows and a scarred visage.</p>
                  <p>"One moment more, and I'd sent a bullet through that dog's skull," observed the last man with an oath.</p>
                  <p>"A couple in the master's head, Grimes, would have been better," suggested the other in an ironical tone.</p>
                  <p>"Would <emph>you</emph> have done it, Mr. Catsby?" inquired the one addressed as Grimes, leering.</p>
                  <p>"As quick as I would take the life of any man or brute that stood in my way."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, you are a tiger," quoth Grimes, affecting admiration. "Mr. Catsby, do you know the man?"</p>
                  <p>"A pretty question to ask me," rejoined Catsby, frowning. "How should I?"</p>
                  <p>"He is the father of that handsome gal we met on the road this morning."</p>
                  <p>"What in the devil's name," growled the leader, "brings him round here with a rifle and a monstrous Newfoundland?"</p>
                  <p>"I smell the meaning," returned Grimes, winking slyly. "The gal goes home and tells her story, and that sets him hunting us up."</p>
                  <p>"Now, mark me," said Catsby, sternly. "If your men are going to trifle in this style, they will alarm the whole neighborhood; we'll have all the country people, who are inquisitive enough, God knows, scenting us up just like that infernal dog. It was silly business stopping the girl."</p>
                  <p>"It wasn't sharp," rejoined Grimes, "but you won't deny you set the boys a bad example; they were all surprised, Mr. Catsby, at your enthusiasm. There is no telling, they might have treated her roughly but for your interference."</p>
                  <p>"I don't pretend to call myself a brute," retorted Catsby, with a sneer; so you needn't put me alongside of your pack of hell hounds."</p>
                  <p>A revengeful expression passed over the evil countenance of Grimes for an instant, then he smiled deceitfully.</p>
                  <p>"You are a saint, Mr. Catsby."</p>
                  <p>"I wish I could make the world think so," replied Catsby, ironically. "But let's to business,—did you notice, by the by,—how that train trembled when it passed?"</p>
                  <p>"It was curious," rejoined Grimes; "right over the gap, too."</p>
                  <p>"Thunder and lightning, man," exclaimed Catsby, stooping down to examine the track, "you forgot to put the screws in. It's a perfect miracle the train didn't go over. If it had, it would have proved certain destruction to our hopes, for it wasn't the one we want; what makes you so infernally careless?"</p>
                  <p>"In my hurry to get away from that cursed dog, I forgot it," rejoined Grimes, with a fearful imprecation. "It was lucky for us the cars didn't tip over the ledge."</p>
                  <p>"And thrice lucky for the passengers," laughed Catsby, leisurely picking up the crow-bar. "Come, Grimes, we had better keep clear of the railroad track in the daytime; we might run foul of that switchman man, he is cunning and would suspect at once."</p>
                  <p>"Put a bullet through him."</p>
                  <p>"If he gets in our way, most certainly, otherwise I shall not waste my powder and ball," said Catsby. "Now what is the hour of meeting?"</p>
                  <p>"Nine o'clock to-morrow evening."</p>
                  <p>"Good," rejoined Catsby, with a satisfied air.</p>
                  <p>"Well, Mr. Catsby, I'll rejoin the boys, and you can keep a look out; you are like a fox, cunning and sly."</p>
                  <p>"But a tiger when aroused," added Catsby, laughing. "Grimes, keep your men quiet; no more straggling round the woods, do you hear?"</p>
                  <p>The subordinate gruffly nodded his head, and without further conversation they parted.</p>
                  <p>The chief gazed after his confederate as he disappeared, with an expression half distrustful, half contemptuous playing over his handsome features.</p>
                  <p>"He is already jealous of me," he muttered. "I must keep a watchful eye on the knave."</p>
                  <p>Arthur Catsby, although the acknowledged leader of the miscreants, had been but a short time acting with them. Grimes had made his acquaintance on the Mississippi, where Catsby had been leading a roving, reckless life. He had been easily induced to join the association, and had soon exerted a powerful influence over these lawless men. Grimes beheld the sceptre of his own rule rudely snatched from his grasp. He hated his rival secretly, and his hatred meant revenge.</p>

                  <head type="sub">HARDY CRAMP BEGINS TO PLOT.</head>
                  <p>"<emph>Ravelwild Station!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cramp swung himself out of the cars and watched them as they quickly glided out of sight. "Ha, ha, ha!" he laughed, "I think the <hi rend="i"/>ruse a clever one, and I'll turn up the winning card yet. <emph>Skittles!</emph> confound you, why don't you move your stumps, you vicious old profligate!"</p>
                  <p>The individual whom Mr. Cramp addressed in these complimentary terms had lingered behind a few moments to refresh himself with the contents of a suspicious-looking black bottle, which he now hastily concealed in his coat-pocket, and came limping forward, wiping his mouth with the back of his coarse hand.</p>
                  <p>"All right, Mister Cramp!"</p>
                  <p>"No, it ain't all right, you mendacious old cutthroat. You waste more time over that gin bottle than I would occupy twisting a rope round your neck; when I strike a bargain, I mean business; that's my way. So now, where's the wagon?"</p>
                  <p>Evidently feeling better after delivering himself of these ill-natured remarks, Hardy Cramp crossed over to a small tavern, while Mr. Jemmy Skittles occupied himself in unhitching a horse and wagon, which in anticipation of their arrival had been fastened to a tree in front of the railroad station.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Skittles was a muscular-looking villain, dressed in a suit of gray. In his ugly face struggled the worst elements of a degraded, debased nature. He was at once a desperado and a coward by turns, standing in great awe of Hardy Cramp, whom he believed possessed wealth, a prerequisite which, in Mr. Skittles' estimation, expressed the sum and substance of all human excellence.</p>
                  <p>"Helloo, you Skittles!" bawled Mr. Cramp, coming out of the tavern bar, where he had been refreshing himself with a glass of brandy and an extra cigar. "Do you intend to be all night unhitching that team, you scoundrelly old vagabond? Come, hurry up!"</p>
                  <p>This insolent command being uttered simultaneous with the approach of Mr. Skittles with the horse and wagon, Hardy Cramp jumped in, and they rolled off at a rattling speed down the road; when they had left the railroad station pretty far behind, Hardy slackened the horse's pace to an easy jog, and said:</p>
                  <p>"Now, Skittles, it won't do for me to be seen in your rascally company for the present, so when you get to that cross road you can let me out. Do you know where the Castle is?"</p>
                  <p>"Mister Cramp, though not much ov a scholard, I can pick my vay."</p>
                  <p>"Damn your scholarship!" rejoined Hardy, testily. "All I want to ascertain is, whether you've got sense enough in your noddle to keep at my heels. I'm going to walk, and you can keep in the wagon until I get to the Castle; then you can hitch your horse in the shade, and wait for my signal."</p>
                  <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC5830-00000008"/>
                  <p>"All right, Mister Cramp, I'll be on hand."</p>
                  <p>"See that you do, you incorrigible old panel thief! What would you have done if I hadn't got you out of the penitentiary?"</p>
                  <p>"Hard words, Mister Cramp!"</p>
                  <p>"Hard words! you deserve in addition some capital hard blows; I could have hired any man in Gotham to do this job for half the money; so now, I'll warrant you I'll not be trifled with, you graceless, irreclaimable old swindler."</p>
                  <p>Having exhausted all the available reproaches in the dictionary, the capricious Mr. Cramp grew more classical and less abusive, possibly from the invigorating effects of his recent visit to the tavern, and confidentially informed Mr. Skittles that he was "going in to win," while Jemmy blinked at him admiringly and expressed the opinion he "wos a waxer."</p>
                  <p>"I'll tell you how I done it," pursued Mr. Cramp, growing more communicative as the brandy rose to his head. "I wrote a note to the old cock, and decoyed him over to the city. I've got a copy of it in my pocket; here it is." Thereupon Mr. Cramp, with much self-elation, drew it forth and read aloud:</p>
                  <p>"If Mr. Dorrance Cruger will meet John Goboy to-morrow afternoon at the Astor House, between the hours of three and four, he will learn something extraordinarily to his advantage in the matter of the estate now mortgaged to that notorious rascal and usurer, Hardy Cramp. Please be punctual."</p>
                  <p>"Ha, ha, ha! what do you think of that, old Sawbones?" inquired Mr. Cramp, exultantly.</p>
                  <p>"A good vun as is a good vun," remarked the erudite Mr. Skittles; "though not much ov a scholard, I kin saw at yer moaning."</p>
                  <p>"It took splendidly," continued Hardy, speaking more to himself than his companion. "The old fellow tripped off unsuspectingly to the city this morning, leaving the coast clear to me and the lovely ladie of the Castle. If I succeed, Skittles, you profit as well as me."</p>
                  <p>"Thankee, Mister Cramp, I didn't go on this ere errand for nothing."</p>
                  <p>"I rather suspect not," sneered Hardy Cramp. "Neither did I; but by thunder it's time I dropped out of this go-cart—stop the pony, do you hear?"</p>
                  <p>"All right, Mister Cramp."</p>
                  <p>The wagon paused; Hardy Cramp leaped out, shook himself, and considerately kicked the horse in the ribs for starting again.</p>
                  <p>"So now, Skittles," said Mr. Cramp, "don't forget my orders. Keep close as you can without creating suspicion. When you've hitched your horse, get the shawl ready—you know what I mean?"</p>
                  <p>"All right, Mister Cramp."</p>
                  <p>Hardy Cramp, having assured himself that his plans were perfectly understood by his subordinate, started up the hill in the direction of the Castle, while Mr. Skittles leisurely followed in the wagon.</p>
                  <p>"I should like to dispense with the services of that old scoundrel," soliloquized the money-lender. "If the girl will relent and accept the terms as first proposed, there will be no need of carrying her off; consequently, Mr. Skittles, you won't be wanted, and I can save my money."</p>
                  <p>The sordid soul of the young usurer was wrung with conflicting emotions of greed and passion, as he strode rapidly towards the Castle; here we will leave him for the present, to return to our heroine.</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">MR. CRAMP MEETS WITH AN ODD INCIDENT WHICH SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSES HIS PROJECTS.</head>
                  <p>Stella was too gay and light-hearted with the buoyancy of youth, to feel more than a transient emotion of uneasiness as she waved a merry good-bye to her father, as he started off the following morning on his visit to New York.</p>
                  <p>The natural sense of loneliness inspired by the absence of a loved parent and the attendant circumstances, was not felt by our brave little heroine. Neptune was a host to her. She had unlimited faith in the ability of her shaggy canine friend to protect her from evil. So, with cheerful step, she moved around the Castle performing her chores with her accustomed assiduity, and then sat on the porch to draw a likeness of Neptune, who was basking in the sun—his ears pricked up, evidently listening to a noise too faint for Stella's ear, but which attracted the close attention of the vigilant animal.</p>
                  <p>Stella inherited a talent for pencil sketching from her mother. She was a natural draughtsman, and drew with the ease of an amateur; absorbed in her pleasing task she did not perceive the gate softly open and a man stealthily enter.</p>
                  <p>Pausing one moment to east a glance of triumph upon the unconscious girl, Hardy Cramp leisurely walked up the gravelled pathway. "She is in my power," he muttered to himself exultantly; "we will now see if her proud airs will save her."</p>
                  <p>The words had scarcely been uttered before Neptune suddenly sprang upon him with the ferocity of a tiger and dragged him to the ground.</p>
                  <p>"Murder!" roared the panic-stricken young gentleman, "Help!" <emph>murder!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>The last abjuration being quite unnecessary, as Stella quickly called off the Newfoundland dog, who reluctantly released his hold of him and retired a few paces growling menacingly.</p>
                  <p>Fortunately for Mr. Hardy Cramp he had sustained no bodily injury, being more frightened than hurt; ruefully he rose to his feet and picked up his hat with such a crest-fallen air that even Stella herself could hardly repress a smile.</p>
                  <p>"So now, this is a nice beginning," he panted, "setting your d—d dog on me; but never you mind, I'll be even with you."</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Cramp," returned Stella, flushing, "can you believe me capable of being so mischievous? If I had seen you enter I should have prevented it; it is unusual for Nep. to attack strangers."</p>
                  <p>"Why don't you keep the dangerous brute chained, any how?" retorted the young money-lender in an exasperated tone. "I'll give you five dollars to tie a rock round his neck and drop him in the creek; or the next time I'll use my six-shooter on him, so now where's your dad?"</p>
                  <p>"My father is away, sir."</p>
                  <p>"And you all alone here, little chit," rejoined Hardy Cramp with a triumphant twinkle in his eyes.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir, I am alone, but I would remind you that the circumstance furnishes you no occasion to take advantage of it in further insulting me," replied Stella, quietly.</p>
                  <p>Hardy had sense enough to perceive that he must change his tactics at once, or abandon the principal object of his visit; so, laying aside his usual insolent bearing, he put on a soft air, meant to be conciliatory, but which altogether failed in its object, and said:</p>
                  <p>"My dear little girl, young lady, or whatsoever you choose to call yourself, let me confess I did not come here to be a bugbear or an annoyance. I am aware you have taken a great dislike to me without any cause, in fact it is all prejudice. I should like you to remember your father is in my power in a business way. Since you have refused my offer, I suppose you know what's going to come out of it?"</p>
                  <p>Stella scarcely raised her eyes, but bowed silently in the affirmative.</p>
                  <p>"I'll tell you what will come out of it," continued Mr. Cramp, congratulating himself that he had now taken the right track, "you'll be a beggar, and your father likewise. To save him from this fate, and you from a life of misery, I made him the offer which I now renew to you; you have your choice."</p>
                  <p>"The answer which you received is the answer you have now," returned Stella, firmly; "I cannot, will not accept it."</p>
                  <p>"You prefer then seeing your father a beggar, you little fool," sneered Hardy, losing his patience, and unable longer to dissemble. "He will go in the almshouse, my dainty chick-a-biddy."</p>
                  <p>"My father, sir, has health, strength and the proper possession of his faculties; he can spare himself the humiliation as well as me the pain of such a fate; when these fail, his daughter can occupy his place and divide with him, if necessary, her last dollar."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, will she?" retorted Mr. Cramp, putting his tongue in his cheek and winking at her jocularly. "Suppose somebody says no; suppose somebody objects to that arrangement."</p>

                  <p>"You are very nonsensical, upon my word," rejoined Stella, curling her lip disdainfully.</p>
                  <p>"Am I?" laughed Mr. Cramp facetiously, as he lit a fresh cigar. "The subject inspires me, listen to another couplet dedicated to my fair ladie of the Castle:" <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">

                  </p>
                  <p>Stella began to think Mr. Cramp must<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC5830-00000009"/> either be drunk or mad; finally concluding he was both, as that erratic gentleman, making a feint of glancing at his watch, declared he was behind time, and would, therefore, have "to tear himself from her sweet society." Having bowed with mock politeness, he darted out of the gate—the rapid movement of his long legs being accelerated by a menacing growl from Neptune, who, during this brief interview, had eyed the young usurer with decided hostility.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cramp no sooner had allowed a proper distance to intervene between himself and the Castle, than he abruptly paused and whistled for Jemmy Skittles.</p>
                  <p>"The first business before us," soliloquized the young villain, "will be to get rid of that infernal dog; confound it, why don't Skittles answer?"</p>
                  <p>He whistled again, louder and shriller than before, and waited several minutes eagerly listening for a reply. The chirping of the cricket, and the occasional scream of a hawk as he flew overhead, were the only sounds which disturbed the serenity of the pleasant summer afternoon.</p>
                  <p>"This is strange!" he muttered; "by thunder, I'd like to know what it means." He proceeded on a few hundred yards further, and loudly repeated the signal. Still no response. "Skittles, you cadaverous old rascal!" he cried, beginning to lose his temper, "where have you hidden yourself?"</p>
                  <p>The thought that Skittles had possibly slipped off and deserted him caused the plotter to gnash his teeth with rage, for he must then abandon the idea of carrying away Stella.</p>
                  <p>Muttering throats of vengeance against his henchman, Hardy hastened on; a short distance further he found the horse and wagon. The pony, secured to a tree, was quietly munching his bit and whisking off the gadflies, but Skittles was nowhere to be seen. Hardy, frenzied with disappointment, shouted lustily; the forest only sent back tantalizing echoes of his own voice. For more than an hour the baffled villain hunted unavailingly for his companion, and perceiving the day was waning, he jumped in his wagon and drove back to the Ravelwild depot, showering innumerable maledictions on the head of Mr. Jemmy Skittles, whom he roundly suspected of having played him false.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">STELLA MAKES A STARTLING DISCOVERY.</head>
                  <p>As the twilight threw its shadows over the landscape, and the stars began to twinkle in the clear canopy above, Burse released for a season from his duties as flag-man and switch-tender of the Ravelwild Station, wended his way to the Castle to perform, as was his custom in the absence of Dorrance Cruger, the out-door work of the farm.</p>
                  <p>The old flag-man was evidently absorbed in deep reverie, for when he had let down the bars of the pasture and allowed the sleek, well-fed cows of the farmer to pass out, he stood thoughtfully peering at their half indistinct forms, puffing problematical columns of smoke from his pipe meanwhile, as though his mind was solving a very difficult and abstruse problem indeed. Niger Burse had lived too long in the neighborhood of the Castle not to feel a strong friendship, even amounting to actual affection, for its inmates. As an old settler of Ravelwild he likewise entertained a fatherly interest in its general welfare, regarding with deep concern the probable transfer of the Castle property into the hands of strangers and aliens "to the manor born." Having cudgeled his legal brains to no purpose in devising a means of preventing or delaying the dreaded catastrophe, he was satisfied he had embodied all his learning and valuable experience in his final, legal opinion to his young client. Burse's mind was therefore wandering in a sea of abstract speculations, and so he might have remained several minutes longer thus cogitating, when his attention was suddenly arrested by a peculiar noise, something similar to the note of a catbird. This sound was repeated twice, then a thicket near the roadside parted and outstepped therefrom a large muscular sized man who stealthily crept away towards the railroad track. As the flag-man watched him with curious, half-suspicious eyes, another fellow made his appearance, taking the same direction as his companion, neither of them evidently noticing the flag-man.</p>
                  <p>Burse gazed after them until they had fairly disappeared in the fast gathering twilight, and shook his head gravely as he turned to follow the cows who were straggling far ahead.</p>
                  <p>When he reached the Castle he found Stella sitting on the porch, with faithful Neptune at her side, waiting for him.</p>
                  <p>"Good evening, Miss," said Burse, gravely, "pretty lonesome, arn't ye?"</p>
                  <p>Stella acknowledged with a smile that she was very lonely indeed.</p>
                  <p>"I thought so," rejoined Burse reflectively, knocking the ashes out of his pipe. "Nobody been to the Castle?"</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Cramp came again to see papa," replied Stella coloring, as she remembered the language and demeanor of her recent visitor. "He behaved so ill, I am sure he was drunk."</p>
                  <p>"Loike enough, loike enough," repeated Burse, contemptuously. "Miss Stell," he added earnestly, "I've sot my mind on taking care of you while your pa is gone. I'm obleeged to be on the look out for the train at nine o'clock, so ye can go with Burse, for he's afeard to leave ye here alone; wot do you say to it?"</p>
                  <p>Stella joyfully accepted the invitation of the kind-hearted flag-man, and when the chores were all done, she locked up the house and followed him, while Neptune, perfectly satisfied with the arrangement, ran ahead, eagerly snuffing the ground as though he had struck a trail of some latent foe.</p>
                  <p>They reached the old flag-man's cabin without meeting any one. Here Burse stopped to light his signal-lantern and take his usual look at a railroad chronometer that hung near the door-way of his rude habitation.</p>
                  <p>It was just ten minutes to nine o'clock.</p>
                  <p>It was invariably the flag-man's habit to start for the switch five minutes earlier, and so snatching up his lantern he hurried off, leaving Stella alone with her faithful guardian, Neptune, who had not ceased since their arrival to manifest an unaccountable restlessness.</p>
                  <p>As our young heroine stood at the door of the cabin, she suddenly heard the tramp of approaching steps; impulsively she caught hold of Neptune's collar, and with an admonitory whisper to him shrank back from view.</p>
                  <p>Three men passed by almost a few feet from the cabin, in low conversation; one had a crow-bar thrown across his shoulder.</p>
                  <p>Stella caught a few words of their conversation, the meaning of which conveyed enough to arouse a desire to hear more. Scarcely waiting to weigh the consequences of her imprudence, she crept out after them, still keeping a firm hold of the collar of Neptune, who, with the instinct of his sagacious nature, seemed to fully comprehend the importance of silence and caution. As their figures rounded the curve, Stella followed with ghostly tread; she had hardly advanced a dozen steps further, when the bright light from a lantern streamed full in her face, and she shrank back into the shadow trembling in silent horror.</p>
                  <p>Gathered in spectral silence round the "Devil's Gap" were forms and faces she had seen before. The tall, handsome, cynical Catsby. The fierce-visaged Grimes,—the evil faces of the men who had impressed her with the first emotions of terror that ever filled her brave young heart.</p>
                  <p>The tall, handsome desperado glanced at his watch, and made a sign to Grimes, who seized his crow-bar, and in a second wrenched a rail from its fastening; a third and fourth rail were displaced; then one of the burly villains, with cool nonchalance, laid the loose bars directly over the track, while Catsby, a half expression of scorn on his handsome features, stood looking idly on.</p>
                  <p>At this moment a shrill whistle broke upon the still evening air, and echoed with awful distinctness in Stella's ear. The Express was rapidly approaching.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE WARNING BEACON!</head>
                  <p>Horrified and bewildered by what she had seen, Stella could scarcely control herself; a wild, concentrated burst of indignation swept through her delicate frame, and once more she tightened her grasp on Neptune's collar, lest sharing in her feelings he might spring upon and alarm the miscreants.</p>
                  <p>She now understood those lawless men had visited Ravelwild for the diabolical purpose of destroying and plundering the approaching train; she knew, too, why they had chosen the frowning chasm of the Devil's Gap.</p>
                  <p>"The destruction of life will be awful," murmured Stella, her blood almost curdling at the thought; "it is too late to tell Burse, but, O God," she ejaculated, "may I not warn them of their danger!"</p>
                  <p>She noticed one of their lanterns lay on the ground a few yards from where she stood, and with that rapid electricity of thought that reaches at and grapples with<pb n="18 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5830-00000010"/> a fresh idea, Stella darted forward and quickly snatched it up.</p>
                  <p>There was something so daring, even reckless in this act, that the miscreants were taken wholly by surprise, and stood gazing at her in amazed bewilderment; then a terrific yell of rage, mingled with horrid imprecations, greeted the bold interloper, for they instantly divined her purpose.</p>
                  <p>"Kill her! kill her!" shouted Grimes, and simultaneously a dozen revolvers were emptied of their leaden contents. The balls flew harmlessly over the head of the devoted girl, who, with the speed of a deer, ran round the curve.</p>
                  <p>The baffled villains were in hot pursuit, and would have soon overtaken her; but their progress, at this critical moment, was impeded by a large, savage dog who suddenly rushed at them and held them at bay.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile Stella, unconscious that Neptune had temporarily diverted their attention, had safely turned the curve and hurriedly raised her lantern, for another whistle, shrill and fearfully near, burst upon the evening air; she could plainly hear the rattling jar of the approaching train,—in another instant the engine was in sight, and the broad glare of its drummond light gleamed with spectral brightness upon her dazzled vision.</p>
                  <p>A great change had come over the spirit of the young girl. It was one of resolute heroism—of utter abnegation of self, as she stationed herself directly in front of the advancing train, and courageously held her beacon light aloft while the iron horse came thundering on.</p>
                  <p>The engineer was a careful, experienced one; he instantly perceived the light from Stella's lantern as it waved warningly to and fro. It told him danger was ahead, and quick as a flash, he whistled down brakes and reversed his engine.</p>
                  <p>It was well he did so; a few seconds more would have sent the Express whirling down the Devil's Gap, a shapeless mass of shivered timbers, blood and bones, for those merciless harpies to prey upon.</p>
                  <p>The engineer leaped out and ran to meet the little figure in white running towards him.</p>
                  <p>"Thank God, you have stopped," exclaimed Stella, breathlessly, "<emph>The track is torn up!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>As she uttered this warning one of the miscreants who had closely pursued her, raised his revolver with deadly aim; but ere his hand could press the trigger, a shot from an unseen marksman laid him dead at Stella's feet.</p>
                  <milestone n="* * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>"That was your work, Mr. Catsby," hissed Grimes, pale with rage.</p>
                  <p>"I meant it," replied the chief derisively. "Dare you object?"</p>
                  <p>Grimes retorted fiercely:</p>
                  <p>"Aye, I do. Our plans have proved a failure; your mawkish sympathies for that child has been our ruin."</p>
                  <p>Catsby laughed scornfully.</p>
                  <p>"It is well you have stout legs, for you'll need them soon. By Heavens!" he added in an altered voice, "I do rejoice at the failure of this hellish plot. I have been a villain, a cursed villain, but from this night with a remembrance of that lovely girl's heroism I am a changed man."</p>
                  <p>His handsome features, as he turned away, were lit up with a strange smile—strange for that reckless face, so full of grand resolution and noble faith—unheeding that Grimes had quickly drawn a revolver and pointed it at his breast,—a flash, a sharp report, and Arthur Catsby reeled and fell; yet with the whirling faintness of receding life he staggered to his feet, caught the murderer in his strong arms, and headlong they both went rolling down the dark, yawning chasm of the Devil's Gap.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE CONCLUSION.</head>
                  <p>Mr. Hardy Cramp sat in his office in Bleecker street, which, unlike most Exchange offices, was exceedingly dirty and uninviting in appearance.</p>
                  <p>It being a rainy afternoon, and business dull, Mr. Cramp had allowed himself to relax from a certain degree of professional austerity which he assumed during his official hours, reclining comfortably in an armchair with his long legs elevated on the mantel, in the enjoyment of a cigar and the privacy of his own thoughts.</p>
                  <p>His thoughts were not, however, of the most agreeable nature, for after making a vain effort to obtain a telescopic view out of the dirty window panes, he allowed his eyes to wander back again to the cobwebby ceiling with an expression of manifest discontent.</p>

                  <p>"Here's a pretty go," he muttered. "More than a week has passed, and Skittles is still missing; by thunder! it is strange, unaccountable, and improbable as any sensational story or first-class dime novel; I have advertised, sent messages, made inquiries, and, hang me, if I can clear up the mystery! Maybe he's dead, which I hope may be the case; maybe he isn't, which of course I should be sorry to hear."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cramp at this stage of his reflections was interrupted by the entrance of a carrier with a letter—post-marked Ravelwild.</p>
                  <p>As there was no especial observation to make, beyond cautioning the carrier to shut the door after him, which was quite unnecessary, inasmuch as he had disappeared with the suddenness of a dissolving show, Mr. Cramp leisurely cut open the envelope so as to draw the note therefrom in a convenient and business-like style, and read with surprise, not to say satisfaction, the following:</p>

                                 <hi rend="i"/>"Mr. Hardy Cramp will please call over to the Castle at the earliest opportunity, and oblige</p>
                              <closer>
                                 <signed>Dorrance Cruger."</signed>

                           </div>
                        </body>

                  </q>
                  <p>"Call over," repeated Mr. Cramp, with a throb of exultation, "of course I will, old fellow. I shouldn't wonder if Stella, the star of my hope, has finally caved in. It's getting near the day of foreclosure, and like the convict whose hour approaches to be swung up, she grows scared and bawls out for a reprieve. Halloo! I mustn't let her have her way too easy, a sweatmeat tastes better for being held back a little."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Hardy, therefore, with his usual shrewdness, sat down and indited a letter to Dorrance Cruger extremely brief and characteristic, informing that gentleman he might expect him "to-morrow, next day, or any day thereafter" which suited his, Mr. Cramp's, capricious humor, but finally wound up with a postscript announcing that he had altered his mind, and would certainly be at the Castle "the next P. M."</p>
                  <p>Faithfully punctual to his appointment, Mr. Cramp's gig stopped in front of the Castle the following afternoon, and the long legs of the money-lender descended with remarkable agility from the vehicle, indicating the owner to be in fine flow of animal spirits.</p>
                  <p>In fact Hardy Cramp, in view of approaching victory, felt uncommonly buoyant and cheerful; he lit a cigar before entering the gate, rapping loudly with his whip handle on the fence as a kind of authoritative announcement of his arrival.</p>
                  <p>No one, not even his old enemy Neptune, condescended to notice it, so Mr. Cramp cautiously entered and ascended the porch steps, wondering why neither Stella nor her father made their appearance, though the blinds of the parlor were thrown back and the hall door open.</p>
                  <p>Not deeming it worth while to be over-ceremonious, the money-lender negligently threw himself in the favorite oak chain of the farmer, crossed his legs and puffed away at his cigar, with half-closed eyes, dreamily calculating the propriety of using a little diplomacy in order to smooth his way in the good graces of Miss Stella Cruger.</p>
                  <p>His meditations were quickly put to flight by the sound of approaching foot-steps.</p>
                  <p>"Look here, Cruge," bawled Mr. Cramp, threateningly. "You are a nice one to send for a fellow and then keep him waiting all day. Thunderation, I can't be bothered in this style."</p>
                  <p>This insolent speech was abruptly cut short by the appearance of an elderly, gray-haired gentleman, with a closely-shaved face, who came forward, snapping his fingers and bowing stiffly:</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Hardy Cramp, I believe."</p>
                  <p>"Why, yes, that's my name," rejoined the young money-lender, gradually opening his eyes in ill-concealed astonishment. "Who in the devil are <emph>you?</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"My card," replied the stranger, "will explain."</p>
                  <p>Hardy Cramp received the introductory bit of pasteboard with an apathetic nod, and glanced at the superscription:</p>
                  <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Timothy Dorkins, Attorney-at-Law, OFFICE, <hi rend="i"/>Chambers street," muttered young Cramp superciliously, tossing it away. "Well a—Mr. Dorkins, if you have business to transact with me, you'll find me at my office in Bleecker street at 10 o'clock to-morrow morning; I've a job just now in hand with another, so you'll have to excuse me; by thunder! I wonder where old Cruge is?"</p>
                  <p>"I am the agent and legal adviser of Mr. Cruger," said the lawyer, coldly, "and I must therefore inform you that our business can be legitimately settled now."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, indeed!" retorted Hardy Cramp, ironically, "because the Rev'd Mr. Dorkins says so, eh? Now, look here, old cock! I should like to know what Cruge is doing with a lawyer, any how; there ain't<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC5830-00000012"/> no use of getting out an injunction; the decision of the Court was final, you know."</p>
                  <p>"Of course," replied Mr. Dorkins, snapping his fingers abstractedly.</p>
                  <p>"And," pursued Hardy, taking his cigar out of his mouth to give more emphasis to his remark, "I shall foreclose when the law tells me; I want to do everything square, that's my way; so now if Cruge has authorized you to beg off for him, all I've got to say, you are wasting your precious breath and losing money besides."</p>
                  <p>"He did not instruct me, nor did I advise him, to make any proposition of that nature," replied Mr. Dorkins dryly.</p>
                  <p>"Cruge accepts my terms, then," observed Hardy, with an ostentatious attempt to appear benevolent. "I made a generous offer to him, and I suppose he's got you down here to make it a square thing."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Dorkins shook his head decidedly.</p>
                  <p>"Nothing of the kind has been even hinted to me."</p>
                  <p>"Then, by thunder! I should like to know," retorted Mr. Cramp, whose countenance considerably lengthened in proportion to his disappointment—"I should like to know why Cruge has taken the pains to send me on a wild goose chase to Ravelwild. Why does he sneak away like a whipped cur, and employ an old legal quirk to badger me?—that's what I want to know."</p>
                  <p>"If you had allowed me," returned Mr. Dorkins, quietly, "I would have at once enlightened you on that point; but, to cut this discussion short, I will refer you to the following paragraph in the <title>Herald</title>, which will still further explain!"</p>
                  <p>Hardy impatiently snatched the newspaper extended to him and read: <q>
                        <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Diabolical attempt to destroy a passenger train on the Erie Railroad! A terrible disaster averted by the heroism and forethought of a young country girl.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>"As the nine o'clock express was approaching the railroad station at its usual rate of speed last evening, the engineer's attention was attracted by a bright light directly over the track, oscillating wildly to and fro.</p>
                  <p>"Astonished at such an unusual occurrence, and wisely deeming it a warning of danger, he stopped the train. An immediate inquiry developed the appalling fact that the <emph>track had been torn up several yards beyond</emph>, right over a precipice of more than 70 feet in depth.</p>
                  <p>"The diabolical attempt was the work of a dangerous gang of mail robbers, their immediate object being, as supposed, the robbery of the express safe, which contained a large amount of specie. The schemes of these fiends in human shape, were happily frustrated by a young girl of about fourteen years, the daughter of Dorrance Cruger, a farmer of Ravelwild, who accidentally overheard the plot, and gave timely warning, at the imminent risk of her own life."</p>
                  <p>"Upon these facts being made known to the Railroad and Express Companies, they presented the brave young heroine with a check, which, with the generous contribution of the passengers, amounts to the handsome sum of $3,000."</p>
                  <p>Hardy read no more; an expression of disgust and secret rage overspread his jewish features as he let the newspaper drop. He was too confounded to speak.</p>
                  <p>"Well," said Mr. Dorkins, snapping his fingers in evident enjoyment of the young villain's discomfiture, "You comprehend better our object in sending for you."</p>
                  <p>"I suppose I ought to," retorted Mr. Cramp, doggedly, "though you might have given me word just as easy as to make me tramp over here. If the girl's in luck, why all her father's got to do is to liquidate, that's all. It's an ill wind that don't blow somebody good, and in this case it's blown a heap of benefit to me, for I knew I had lost money when I consented to lend anything on this tumble-down old tenement. If you have the authority you might as well fork over the money now."</p>
                  <p>"It has been suggested," observed Mr. Dorkins, who had listened to this ill-natured speech with much contempt—"It has been suggested by the friends of Miss Stella that, as the sum presented to her is exactly the amount required for the settlement of the mortgage, you might be induced to make some reasonable deduction, from the knowledge you have of her circumstances, and the interest you have professed for the young lady herself."</p>
                  <p>"Come, old quibbler, you ain't going to soft-sawder me as easy as you think," exclaimed Hardy, with a sneer. "I know what you are worming at. Now let me tell you, I would see Cruger and his daughter buried at the bottom of the sea before I'd abate the sum one jot or tittle. So now."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cramp folded his arms and scowled with malicious triumph as he spoke.</p>
                  <p>"You won't compromise then," said Mr. Dorkins, snapping his fingers.</p>
                  <p>"<emph>No</emph>," replied Hardy Cramp, bringing his fist down on the floor with a decisive thump, "I want my three thousand dollars, no more or less."</p>
                  <p>"Suppose I hint, young man, at the possibility of forcing you to a compromise."</p>
                  <p>"Try it, old boy," retorted Mr. Cramp derisively. "Bring up your musty lawbooks, howl away—I'll listen to you. It's the money you're after; you calculate to get a few hundred out of the three thousand yourself, eh, Mr. Dorkins."</p>
                  <p>At this stage of the dialogue, Mr. Cruger with Stella leaning on his arm, quietly joined them. The farmer's cheerful face reflected the radiant face of his pretty daughter; a proud air of conscious triumph illuminated her soft hazel eyes, and tinted with the hue of vermilion her brown cheeks.</p>
                  <p>Hardy, in the fury of his malignant speech, had not at first perceived their entrance, but now he turned and recognized them.</p>
                  <p>"And <emph>you, too</emph>," he said, stealthily pointing his finger towards the farmer, have come to help <emph>him</emph> force me in this compromise business. We shall see."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, we shall see," thundered Mr. Dorkins, "we shall know at least how long you will dare assume that face of brazen effrontery. Against your demand for settlement, I can off-set a grave charge which only remains to be proved, to send you to the Penitentiary!"</p>
                  <p>Hardy was about to interrupt, but the lawyer sternly silenced him.</p>
                  <p>"Hardy Cramp, a grave accusation rests against you. <emph>It is the crime of abduction.</emph> There stands your intended victim in that young girl."</p>
                  <p>Hardy turned pale, with the pallor of conscious guilt; his air of easy assurance did not altogether fail him, as he replied hoarsely:</p>
                  <p>"I deny the charge; who accuses me?"</p>
                  <p>"I do, Mr. Cramp," spoke Mr. Cruger, advancing with firm dignity. "Your forged letter did not effect its purpose, to lure me from the Castle. Suspecting a sinister design, I feigned, even to my daughter, to leave Ravelwild; but I remained home and watched, to find my worst fears realized."</p>
                  <p>"This is all very well," interrupted Hardy rudely; "your lawyer there will tell you assertion without proof means nothing."</p>
                  <p>"Do you wish me to produce the proof?" inquired Mr. Cruger, quietly.</p>
                  <p>"Documentary evidence, eh," rejoined Mr. Cramp, complacently puffing at his cigar; "well, if you have any proof produce it, that's my way."</p>
                  <p>He did not observe the look of sadness, even pity, depicted on the faces of Dorrance Cruger and his daughter, as Mr. Dorkins gave a sign, and Burse, the flag-man, stepped in view, conducting no less a personage than Jemmy Skittles.</p>
                  <p>A thunderbolt crashing on the head of the young villain could not have more startled him than this unexpected sight of his former confederate in iniquity; he shrank back in his chair, speechless and terrified.</p>
                  <p>"Mister Cramp, I 'ope ye does't forgit ole friends," said Mr. Skittles, bowing with aggravating politeness.</p>
                  <p>The money-lender made no reply, his swaggering assurance had vanished; crouched in his seat, he presented a picture so abject and forlorn, that even Stella pitied him.</p>
                  <p>"Now listen to me, young man," said Mr. Dorkins, impressively. "Your confederate, whom you hired to further your nefarious plans, while waiting to carry out your lawless plot, was captured and held a prisoner; to save himself he made a full confession. His statement shows you to be a villain of the deepest dye. It was not enough to beggar the father, and drive him from his home, but you must ruthlessly conspire to rob him also of his only solace and comfort, his young and innocent daughter; you have rendered yourself amenable to the laws of your land, and deserve the severest punishment. Now, you may have your choice—<emph>sign a release for that mortgage, or go to the Penitentiary</emph>."</p>
                  <p>"Don't push me too hard" groaned Hardy, whose avaricious heart was stirred to its very depth. "Give me time to consider."</p>
                  <p>"I will give you five minutes to decide," said Mr. Dorkins, looking at his watch; "within sound of my voice is a constable, armed with full authority to arrest you; five minutes is long enough for you to make up your mind, and do justice to this worthy gentleman and much abused daughter."</p>
                  <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC5830-00000013"/>
                  <p>There was a dead silence; every eye was turned towards the young usurer, whose countenance betrayed the conflicting agitation of a cowardly and penurious heart.</p>
                  <p>At last, slowly and reluctantly he rose to his feet, and followed the lawyer in the parlor; the paper was made ready for him to sign, and in the presence of the father and daughter he had so often browbeaten and insulted, Hardy Cramp forever relinquished all claims to the Castle and its broad acres.</p>
                  <p>When this imposing ceremony was fairly concluded, Burse could no longer restrain his pent up feelings; he swung his hat in the air, and gave vent to a shout which was taken up by Neptune, in glad chorus.</p>
                  <p>Stella did not speak, but her glowing face eloquently expressed her happy thoughts: the Castle was out of debt at last, and its inmates free from further persecution. The whole seemed like a beautiful dream, and, nestling in her father's arms, she cried for very joy.</p>
                  <p>The lawyer sat folding up the precious document, contemplating the happy family group with a pleasant smile, and now turned to give a parting word to Hardy Cramp, but he was gone.</p>
                  <p>The baffled plotter had slunk away with curses upon his lips, never to darken the threshold of the Castle again.</p>

                  <head>(No. 1.) Morning.</head>
                  <p>IT is morning—morning, with its flashing currents of light, leaping joyously from the east—morning, with its rising splendor, suffusing all the housetops with its crimson glory—morning, with its tinkling music of ear-bells, its hearse calls of milk vendors and hurried tread of workmen rushing to their daily toil—morning, with its echo of horns, ringing of bells, and clattering of carts.</p>
                  <p>The great monster is waking up with its thousand pulsating arteries, and though all may look to the ordinary eye like mere machinery, jarring, creaking, sliding, whirling and buzzing, still there is a big heart which directs and moves the mighty whole. Heavens! what a glorious morning; and yet there are hundreds of gloomy, morose faces that grow pale over midnight orgies, or hide their shame in some glittering sepulchre of disease and death, which will never bask in the light of this cheerful sun.</p>
                  <p>I wish I could understand why yonder sleeper prefers sickly slumbers in his pent-up closet, while the sun is streaming through his casement with gorgeous splendor.</p>
                  <p>I would rather be that newsboy over the way, if he <emph>has</emph> got a ragged coat, and breeches out at the knees.</p>

                     <emph>Mornin' papers—here's yer hextra!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>Thank you, my honest little friend; and as you stand before me, red with exercise, tell me is there any life harder than yours, when, from early dawn until midnight's hour, you pursue your energetic and ceaseless round; bellowing with hoarse voice, "hextra! morning papers," intruding your saucy, unwashed face in every nook and corner of street and avenue ear, steamboat and hotel. With loud clamor and hideous yell, ubiquitous little wretch, pursue your morning's work! you are, indeed, the type or counterpart of that restless, terrible energy that infuses itself in every business department; which surges from Wall street and up Central Park, sweeps from every lane, tenement-house and hotel, and goes jingling and roaring down Broadway. Shout on, lusty boy, and as you go up life's dizzy ladder, hold on bravely. Don't look down on that slough of vice and wretchedness below, but keep looking up, boy, and you will get to the top yet.</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Black your boots—shine!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>Ah! and if you can shine them half as bright as those glittering eyes of yours, you may count upon reaping a larger reward than the modest sum you reckon upon. I don't believe you are bad, because your face is grimmed, and your jacket out at the elbows; you see hard work enough to grind your feelings in a very small compass, but when you divided your bread and butter with that poor, homeless lad, adding a bit of wholesome advice into the bargain, you plainly proved to me there is heart enough beating within that ragged jacket to make a gentleman after all. Polish away, and don't get discouraged if some boots are muddy and kick at you in their splenetic humor; the world is not all alike, thank God!</p>
                  <p>There is a little girl, busily trading her wares; she would shame your yellow kid dandy who stands half the day loafing around the hotel-steps, or sipping claret in Delmonico's—she would shame nice young ladies who visit Stewart's, and never see beggars in the streets; with her matches, pins and shoe-laces, she is as active as any broker in Wall street.</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Matches, thur?</emph>" Why you'd light my cigar with your flashing eyes. A widow mother, did you say? I do not doubt it, though yonder big man buttons his pockets up and gruffly denounces you as an "impostor." You are in the dawn of morning, my girl; may your light never fade in the gloom of night.</p>
                  <p>A hand-organ upon my word! rather early, my friend, to grind your instrument. It has a cheerful sound, to be sure, though I dare say your arm is weary enough in turning it. Be not discouraged if the pennies come in slowly, but grind away, consoling yourself with the reflection that everybody who has an honest living to make in Gotham, grinds equally as hard as you.</p>
                  <p>The baker and butcher grinds; the artisan grinds; the artist grinds; the literary man grinds; and it would become a horrid, ceaseless grind indeed, if we did not do it in as cheerful a mood as possible.</p>
                  <p>There is a light, blithesome step for you! It is a seamstress hastening to her hard day's toil; she may earn a scanty pittance, but she can sing merrily for all that, and return home in the evening with a heart full of affection and love, to lay her scanty wages in her mother's lap, and feel in the kisses that are pressed on her weary brow a sweeter reward than mines of ill-gotten wealth. The same old story, you say; but such every-day sunshine lights up many an humble home.</p>
                  <p>I do not believe that Gotham is a whit more immoral than any other large city of its size. Wise heads are fond of degrading humanity below its level. I don't go to churches to learn human nature; I can see it in the crowd of faces that pass and repass. I can behold it in Broadway. I can criticise it in the Bowery, and peep at it in Chatham street. Take your Bowery girl and your Bowery boy; you will find faith and pluck in them enough to brighten a thousand homes.</p>
                  <p>Mose and Lize, though notable characters, are not the same individuals that pleased the fancies and tickled the humors of Gotham thirty years ago. The modern Mose drinks oceans of lager beer and swears enmity to excise laws. The modern Lize equally repudiates female suffrage. Both are frequenters of Tony Pastor's and patronize civic and military balls; but Lize no longer, as in palmy days, calls for her historic cup of coffee and nine doughnuts.</p>
                  <p>Mose will pick one boy out of the gutter to save him from a cart-wheel, and kick another over who happens to be in his way. He is at the race-course, not because he loves gambling, but relishes horse-flesh. He is one of 'em at a prize fight, but only goes to insure fair play. He scorns the paid Fire Department, but is willing to give an occasional helping hand to "Sikesy" should that estimable gentleman require his services.</p>
                  <p>Lize slangs it dreadfully, but she is never irreverent; she may be coarse, but she is not immoral. Otherwise these two noted personages are the same; great on the muscle, great on the rampage, and ever cheerful, beaming lights of Bowery and Chatham social life.</p>
                  <p>Take my arm this fine morning and let us stroll out a little in the sunshine; I am about to take my customary peeps and sly looks around.</p>
                  <p>I have a curious kind of spectacles that pierce through brick walls, unbar society and lift the curtain that conceals much which is good and much which is evil in Gotham. No Asmodeus gave me those spectacles—no bottled imp of darkness presented them to me; but here they are, and I mean to use them.</p>
                  <p>The first house I shall enter is yonder lodgings. There is one room, now occupied by a music teacher, who disturbs the attic with diabolical howls. He is a professional man, who cooks his own beefsteak and occasionally patronizes the restaurant with a fifteen cent ticket. He knows the inside of "Simpson's"—and it don't worry him now as it formerly did to see the poor creatures huddling round that counter with their eyes fixed in mute, appealing sympathy to the hard, calculating face of the pawnbroker; no, no, he don't quarrel with the man who asks him how much he wants, and<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC5830-00000014"/> then don't give it to him; on the contrary, he believes that the pawnbroker is a good institution, and he has certainly been relieved from many a hard knock by his dear "uncles" the money-changers; but I don't intend to give you the music teacher's history. It is stereotyped, and you can obtain it from a hundred others. I am bringing you to another room where an artist lives. He is a light-haired, fair-eyed gentleman, with a kindly smile—though sad.</p>
                  <p>His studio and chamber are one. It does not matter, for visitors seldom come except to present bills; ever returning with their unwelcome, creaking boots and ominous knock.</p>
                  <p>The artist's room is very bare of furniture. A few portraits are suspended from the walls, and on an easel, standing in the middle of the room, is his masterpiece representing "Sunrise."</p>
                  <p>It is a painting of novel and singular beauty; though unfinished it has an exquisite depth of coloring, a landscape of truth, force and originality. Morning is rising from her couch, and bathing her fair face in the dew that trembles from leaf and floweret. It is a poetical conception; but the artist is reclining in his arm-chair oppressed with anxious thoughts. He has had his sunrise, and now his evening is coming on.</p>
                  <p>The door opens and the landlady, with threatening countenance, enters, to demand her rent. She must have it. The score has mounted up; promises will not maintain her.</p>
                  <p>"You have lived a long while on me. You must pay or leave."</p>
                  <p>"Madam, one word, observe that painting—it is my masterpiece; wait until it is finished and you shall have your dues."</p>
                  <p>"I don't see anything beautiful about it. I hardly believe it will sell for much."</p>
                  <p>"After I am dead and gone," rejoined the artist, covering his face with his hands in deep dejection, "it will remind you of one who suffered and sorrowed without realizing his early hopes and aspirations. It is yours, only let me finish it."</p>
                  <p>The artist returned to his easel, and when evening came the picture was finished.</p>
                  <p>The next morning the artist was found dead in his room. He had expired so suddenly that the curious faces which peered in at the still form whispered: "He committed suicide;" but when the Coroner came and lifted aside the sheet to gaze on the cold, calm face, marked by lines of sorrow and care, he said, "This is no suicide; he died from natural causes."</p>
                  <p>The poor artist was buried by charitable hands, and the picture of Sunrise was hung up many months in the landlady's parlor, who was positive it would never liquidate one-tenth part of the debt incurred by her unfortunate lodger; but finally a man came and examined the work, and being a judge of pictures, he offered her fifty dollars which was readily accepted, for it more than covered the claims against the artist.</p>
                  <p>The wily purchaser went his way with his prize, which he easily sold for one thousand dollars.</p>
                  <p>Sunrise was exhibited to admiring hundreds. The beautiful creation of the artist's pencil was praised in the newspapers, and flattered by the approbation of critics; but the genius who formed it, the heart which throbbed with ambitious hope, had been crushed by penury and neglect.</p>
                  <p>The world's applause had come, as it often does, too late.</p>

                  <p>NOON by the City Hall clock and that fat alderman's watch which he so ostentatiously displays as he turns into "Crook's" to regale on an oyster stew.</p>
                  <p>Noon to the poor, weary seamstresses and factory-girls, who swarm into the neighboring bakeries to eke out an economical meal of bread and cheese.</p>
                  <p>Noon to the up-town boarding-houses, who serve out their customary lunch of tea and hash to patient medical students and pimple-faced apprentices.</p>
                  <p>Noonday, when the great arteries of the city pulsate and throb sympathetically in one direction.</p>
                  <p>Society grows eminently democratic in a metropolitan restaurant; Official Greatness throws off dignity and the cares of State, sips claret side by side with the uncombed, unwashed, rough, and even Contumely relaxes its harsh visage into a smile as it dashes into the roast beef and dumplings.</p>
                  <p>That pleasant-faced gentleman who stands at the counter to receive the checks, and make change, is acquainted with all the sinuosities of Gotham life. He is able to point out all the notable characters that belong exclusively clusively to Manhattan society—all the queer, peculiar people who thrive by living on other folks; all those fast gentlemen who make stealing a profession, and whose text and guide is derived from the immortal "Big Six" himself; all the flash men of Chatham and the Bowery; all the literary scribblers from the aristocratic reporter, down to the humble penny-a-liner, and, in short, he is a walking directory, that can tell a man's age, occupation, and residence at a glance, and give the precise estimate of his moral, mental, and financial condition.</p>
                  <p>From the pleasant-faced gentleman I gleaned the following little story of</p>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>Pop's Jewels.</head>
                     <p>In the earlier days of Gotham, when the Astor House and Barnum's Museum winked at each other across Broadway, and by force of association and similarity of disposition became very great friends, there lived a youth named Johnny Poplin, familiarly known in the neighborhood of Fulton street, as Pop, the newsboy.</p>
                     <p>Unlike most boys, Pop had grown up to sixteen under no particular obligations to anybody. He had been born somewhere, tumbled about everywhere, and from mere habit, had continued to tumble along in the same independent way.</p>
                     <p>As a newsboy he had made his mark and impress on society with his stentorian voice, which, at early dawn to even tide, shouted with ringing vim from the battery to the Park.</p>
                     <p>Everybody knew Pop, admired his energy and patronized him; he was a stout, rosy-cheeked lad, of more than ordinary intelligence, and so completely business-like that no one could deny he was bound to carve out, in time, a fortune of his own.</p>
                     <p>Pop's habits were simple and economical as a miser's; he slept in the open air in the summer season, and bunked at a moderate figure at cheap lodging-houses in the winter; his face was familiarly known in the restaurant of "Beagle &amp; Jones," who paraded before the public in an attractive appearing advertisement, the following bill of fare: <list>
                           <item>Roast beef, 6 cents.</item>
                           <item>Roast lamb, 6 "</item>
                           <item>Mutton chops, 6 "</item>
                           <item>Pork and beans, 6 "</item>
                           <item>Roast turkey, 1 shilling.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Pop had a favorite seat at the restaurant which he chose because of its secluded nature, being separated from the other tables by a dingy red curtain. He invariably called for baked beans, for the economical reason that it wont further and relished better than other dishes at the same price. The waiter got so used to the habits of Pop that he no sooner obtained a perspective view of the young gentleman's head descending into their subterranean dining-room, than he shouted through the port hole, "beans!" and the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">habitués</foreign> of the kitchen as they shoved out a generous-sized plateful of the popular edible, flanked with a large bit of pork and chunk of bread, mentally exclaimed: "That's Pop's order," as of course it would prove.</p>
                     <p>One fine October day, just as the City Hall clock announced the hour of noon, Pop, according to his custom, had ensconsed himself in his favorite seat at "Beagle &amp; Jones'," when he was somewhat surprised, not to say annoyed by the appearance of a stranger, who, without much ceremony, availed himself of the remaining bench directly opposite to the newsboy.</p>
                     <p>The stranger was a large, powerful-built man about thirty years of age, dressed in a suit of black and wearing a Panama hat.</p>
                     <p>His smoothly shaven face was not disagreeable,—on the contrary, rather pleasing, as he bowed with a benevolent smile to young Pop, and quietly hung his Panama on the vacant hook.</p>
                     <p>"A fine day, young man," remarked the stranger blandly.</p>
                     <p>Now the newsboy had never before been addressed in such complimentary terms, and the title of "young man" was especially flattering to him; so he hastened to acknowledge his urbane greeting by expressing the reciprocal opinion that it was a very fine day indeed.</p>
                     <p>"Being a stranger in those parts," pursued the benevolent-faced gentleman, "I strayed in here for a lunch. Is it a pretty good restaurant?"</p>
                     <p>"I find it tip-top myself," replied Pop, his mouth full of beans.</p>
                     <p>"I should judge so from appearances," returned the stranger with remarkable suavity. "Waiter, a dish of pork and beans for me, if you please."</p>
                     <p>It was brought, and the stranger went to work upon them with great apparent appetite.</p>
                     <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC5830-00000015"/>
                     <p>Pop was rather reticent and unsocial in his ordinary demeanor, but the politeness of the new-comer, as well as his captivating address, had favorably impressed him. He sat eyeing him askance, out of the corner of his black eyes, wondering who he could be, and the object of addressing him; for the newsboy was no fool, and suspected the stranger designed to cultivate his acquaintance.</p>
                     <p>This surmise seemed to wear an appearance of probability when the gentleman paused in the midst of his meal and said:</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps you do not remember me?"</p>
                     <p>"No, sir," replied Pop, bluntly, "I don't think I ever saw you before."</p>
                     <p>"Allow me to introduce myself," rejoined the stranger, in the blandest of tones. "My name is Augustus F. Jorker, late of England, now of America; my profession is a clergyman,—preacher, you understand; although, as you remark, you have no recollection of me, <emph>your</emph> face is very familiar. I have met you, perhaps, a dozen times a day in the street vending your newspapers, and I particularly admired your energy and zeal. I need hardly add, it is highly commendable in you, very commendable, indeed. May I inquire your name?"</p>
                     <p>"Pop, sir," replied the newsboy, blushing to the roots of his bristly hair.</p>
                     <p>"Ah, Pop! that's a good title," said the Rev. Mr. Jorker, approvingly. "I never heard of a bo—ah, young man, of vicious habits that could boast of the name of Pop. Now I remember there was a youth of that name who was hung at the Old Bailey for horse stealing, but he was unjustly convicted. Circumstantial evidence brought to the gallows an innocent man, sir; by the by, Mr. Pop, do you ever take anything?"</p>
                     <p>The Rev. Mr. Jorker propounded this inquiry with such an insinuating smile and affable manner that the newsboy scarcely had the courage to say no, and in his confusion said "yes," whereupon his friend nodded to the waiter, and directed him to bring a glass of brandy for Mr. Jorker, and as for Mr. Pop he would speak for himself.</p>
                     <p>Pop stammered out that he guess'd he would prefer wine.</p>
                     <p>The Reverend Mr. Jorker courteously waved his hand.</p>
                     <p>"You will, perhaps, be surprised at my choice, Mr. Pop, but an affection of the throat"—here Mr. Jorker coughed suggestively—"renders it a peculiar necessity in my case. My physician, sir, has recommended it to me, and I therefore waive the moral objection. My physician says to me, 'Mr. Jorker, be independent of the world's opinion and take your bitters and liquor in public. Calumny's foul breath may reach you, but your reputation as a preacher will bear you through. You have a valuable life to preserve, and you must be guided by your physician's advice;' and I obey him."</p>
                     <p>The Reverend gentleman sighed, and the brandy making its appearance at this moment, he drank it down with a gurgling sound and smacked his lips with infinite relish.</p>
                     <p>Poor Pop, whose stomach had never been used to anything stronger than water, made a vain attempt to imitate the Rev. Mr. Jorker in swallowing his half tumblerful of wine at a draught, an experiment that resulted in a series of choking and coughing spells, which Mr. Jorker promptly arrested by thumping the young gentleman on the back until he came to with a very red face and tears in his eyes.</p>
                     <p>"That will do for a beginning," remarked Mr. Jorker sympathizingly. "You've got the stamina in you to drink, after a few more trials, half a dozen such glasses at a swallow."</p>
                     <p>Pop, with the wine in his head, felt highly flattered by this compliment, and even dropped a broad hint that the next time he might try brandy.</p>
                     <p>"I have no doubt of it," replied the Rev. Mr. Jorker, laughing. "You are a smart young man, I can see that. Now if it won't interfere with your business, have you any objection to stroll over to the park? I would like to have some conversation with you."</p>
                     <p>Pop readily agreed to this proposition; the wine made his head tower almost as high as St. Paul's steeple, and in the excess of his admiration for his quondam friend he would have willingly followed him anywhere.</p>
                     <p>Crossing over to the City Hall park, they seated themselves on one of the rough settees, and Mr. Jorker said:</p>
                     <p>"As I before remarked, Mr. Pop, I have seen you busy at your craft, and picked you out as a young man of decided ability; you are, in fact, the very article I want for an agent."</p>
                     <p>"An agent," repeated Pop, opening his eyes if possible still wider.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, travelling merchant. Perhaps I should explain," added Mr. Jorker, parenthetically. "Although a clergyman, Mr. Pop the delicate state of my health forbids I should work in the Lord's vineyard; for the present I am pursuing the worldly avocation of a merchant: to come to business, is your present employment profitable?"</p>
                     <p>"Not over and above," replied Pop, reflectively.</p>
                     <p>"That coincides with my impression," returned the clerical gentleman. "I should judge it was a dog's life at the best,—by the by, do you smoke?"</p>
                     <p>Pop, who generally treated himself to odd bits of cigars found in the streets, replied deferentially that occasionally he did smoke; whereupon Mr. Jorker politely handed him a fresh havana and lit one for himself.</p>
                     <p>"My physician," pursued Mr. Jorker, apologetically, "earnestly recommends smoking as a cure for general debility, which I have been much afflicted with of late years."</p>
                     <p>Pop thought for a debilitated gentleman the Reverend Mr. Jorker was certainly an extremely hearty and robust specimen, though he did not communicate his impressions, but puffed silently at his imported cigar.</p>
                     <p>"To come to the point from where we started," continued Mr. Jorker, "you admit your present business is far from being profitable. You haven't got more than three hundred dollars deposited in the savings bank, have you?"</p>
                     <p>"Not as much as that," replied Pop frankly. "One hundred and fifty dollars just."</p>
                     <p>"Well, one hundred and fifty—now, Mr. Pop, it strikes me that you could invest that sum to better advantage by entering my business; to speak confidentially, I'm in the jewelry line, and you are the very man who would make a live agent for me; come," added the clerical gentleman, with a mysterious air, "I will show you something, but it must be a secret between us."</p>
                     <p>Mr. Jorker having assured himself by a careful reconnoissance that there were no curious eyes about, cautiously drew from the breast-pocket of his coat, a small casket; he touched a spring and the cover flew open.</p>
                     <p>Pop uttered an exclamation of delighted surprise.</p>
                     <p>It contained a number of jewels and precious stones which glittered and sparkled in the sun's rays with irridescent beauty.</p>
                     <p>There was the sparkling diamond, the yellow topaz, the green emerald, and the rich garnet; what more, Pop could not tell, for, while he bent over the treasure in breathless admiration, Mr. Jorker closed the lid with a sudden snap, declaring that he was afraid of exposing them to public gaze for fear of being robbed.</p>
                     <p>"Twenty thousand dollars wouldn't purchase the contents of that box," said Mr. Jorker, emphatically tapping it as he returned it to his coat pocket. "Now, Mr. Pop," if I should intrust those valuable jewels into your care you'd possibly think me crazy, wouldn't you?"</p>
                     <p>"I should say," rejoined Pop, with a glow of enthusiasm, "that you had great confidence in my honesty."</p>
                     <p>"Why, so I have," replied Mr. Jorker, laughing. "The very moment I rested my eye on you I said: there is a young man of honesty, capability and intelligence, just the man, in fact, whom I would safely risk twenty thousand dollars in his keeping; he would make me a capital travelling agent and confidential clerk; by the by, Mr. Pop, how would you like to enter into the business?"</p>
                     <p>"Very much, indeed," answered Pop, whose eyes fairly danced with pleasure. Between the wine, jewels and fascinating address of the Reverend gentleman, the newsboy had been wrought up to an unwonted pitch of excitement.</p>
                     <p>"If I may venture a word of advice," said Mr. Jorker, as he ratified the new business arrangement with a cordial pressure of the hand, "I would suggest drawing out your money from the bank as speedily as possible. I lost six thousand dollars, a year ago, by foolishly depositing it in a savings bank. The day I came to make the deposit, the rascally President, who knew the concern was about to fail, met me with bows and scrapes, assuring me that the institution was the safest in the country; twenty-four hours afterwards the bank suspended payment. If I may speak confidentially, Mr. Pop, those savings banks are a set of swindling associations from beginning to end. They delude all the poor seamstresses and newsboys into their net. They are humbugs, sir."</p>
                     <p>"You advise me to draw out my money, then?" said Pop, who was naturally alarmed by the startling picture the Rev. Mr. Jorker had drawn illustrative of the insecurity of banks, and of savings banks in particular.</p>
                     <p>"Draw it out by all means," returned Mr. Jorker emphatically, "and invest the amount in the jewelry business; where you<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC5830-00000016"/> are realizing one dollar now, you'll make a hundred. One of my agents earned one hundred dollars in one week, another two hundred and fifty; still another, three hundred. Fabulous sums are netted in this lucrative business."</p>
                     <p>Pop needed no further argument to persuade him of the efficacy of Mr. Jorker's advice. He accordingly hurried over to the bank and drew out his deposit of one hundred and fifty dollars, the carefully hoarded earnings of many a hard, weary tramp through the mud and dust of New York.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Jorker was waiting for him at the corner of the street, and smiled benevolently when Pop struck his jacket pocket, and said:</p>
                     <p>"I've got it here, sir."</p>
                     <p>"You had better permit me to keep it for you," observed Mr. Jorker in a kindly tone. "You might be easily robbed."</p>
                     <p>"I'll let you have it on one condition," said Pop cunningly.</p>
                     <p>"Name it," replied Mr. Jorker smiling.</p>
                     <p>"Give me the care of the jewels."</p>
                     <p>"Oh, you wish me to test your honesty, eh," rejoined Mr. Jorker, laughing. "You are a sharp lad—a very sharp lad. Here, I'll humor you,—take the box, and give me the money."</p>
                     <p>The transfer was quickly made. Mr. Jorker cautioning him to hide the casket from observation, and at the same time slipping Pop's roll of bills in his own pocket with an odd expression of satisfaction on his sleek features.</p>
                     <p>"Now we'll start for the railroad depot," continued Mr. Jorker pleasantly. "Be kind enough to remain here for a moment while I get a cab."</p>
                     <p>Uttering this in a hurried tone, Mr. Jorker darted down the street.</p>
                     <p>Pop, proud of the confidence Mr. Jorker had reposed in him, placed the valuable casket inside his jacket and kept a jealous watch over it.</p>
                     <p>Minute after minute passed and the Reverend gentleman did not make his appearance. Pop looked anxiously up and down the street, sighted every conveyance, carriage or cab, and at the end of an hour began to indulge in some unpleasant misgivings. These misgivings finally worked into terrible conviction when the newsboy staggered into the jewelry store of Tinsall &amp; Co. and displayed the precious stones before their experienced vision.</p>
                     <p>Pop's worst fears were realized—they were nothing but glass—clever imitations, but as meretricious and false as the artful impostor who had so successfully swindled him.</p>
                     <p>For several days poor Pop was inconsolable, but at last a happy idea struck him; he would sell the cheap jewels at their market value and begin the world anew. Unexpectedly his first venture was a lucky one; he invested the proceeds in a second stock, and repeating this many times, at a due period, more than covered the loss he had sustained through his misplaced confidence in the artful representations of the seductive Mr. Jorker. He never met that affable gentleman again, but it was a life's lesson.</p>
                     <milestone n="* * * *" unit="typography"/>
                     <p>Twenty years have rolled away. Pop's voice is no longer heard vending his wares in the busy marts of Gotham, and Pop's head is seen no more descending the basement dining-room of "Beagle &amp; Jones;" but if you will drop in that large and popular restaurant on Chatham street at noon you will notice a dignified-looking gentleman, with dark eyes, who eats his lunch quietly, and passes out with a pleasant smile and bow to the proprietor—that is John Poplin, Esq., the wealthy merchant, showing little in his shrewd, business face to remind you of the newsboy who so wisely turned his misadventure with the swindler Jorker to good advantage, and made his cheap jewels the source and foundation of a princely fortune.</p>

                  <head>(No. 3.) Night.</head>
                  <p>It is evening—evening with its myriad of street lamps that blink fitfully from the Battery and go twinkling up town in unison with the tramping crowd. Not the up-town of twenty years ago, when the genteel lounger picked his teeth on the steps of the New York Hotel, or when the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">beau monde</foreign> eat late suppers at Delmonico's! Not the up-town that amused the gay elite of Union Square or denizens of Fifth avenue. No. It wasn't then all shoddy and codfish, but quiet, elegant, and rural. Bond street was going down town, and Union Square <emph>seemed</emph> the tip-top of aristocratic splendor!</p>
                  <p>I love those old by-gone days when you <emph>could</emph> find a restaurant at 'Sweeny's" that didn't charge more than six cents for a plate of roast beef; when the Broadway and Park theatres were the rage, and "Kipp &amp; Brown" threaded the mazes of Broadway without a rival. I repeat, I love those old vestiges of Knickerbocker when everything wasn't gas, gilding and gaiters; there is no use in repining. Those days are gone, never to return; but without further moralizing I will return to my subject.</p>
                  <p>It is evening, and the crowd is surging homeward from a day of toil. How many are still working in pent-up offices and heated rooms, delving, toiling, sweating; not for riches, not for honors, but simply <emph>bread</emph>. Every one cannot be wealthy; few attain distinction; it is not that which the great mass seek—<emph>it is bread</emph>. Life becomes in the great city one fierce, terrible, exciting struggle for this necessary boon. Bread is shouted in the streets. It comes wailing from the brokers' shops. It is whispered in the intelligence offices; it is a great and fearful cry that keeps up, morning, noon and night, without cessation. It does not assume the stereotyped guise of poor, shivering humanity, standing on the corner vainly imploring the charity of a cold and speculative world. It does not belong exclusively to almshouse and tenement mediocrity; no, it is a popular cry—it follows in the wake of politics; it frantically seizes the skirt of opulence; it seeks for office; it begs, it borrows, it steals; it nerves the hand of the suicide, it gives firmness to the murderer's purpose, and yet 'tis nothing more when the matter is sifted, than a wild, desperate struggle for bread.</p>
                  <p>I must ask you to allow me to draw a little picture; you may say it is a very forced and unnatural one, but it is, nevertheless, true.</p>
                  <p>It is a wretched tenement in Mott street that I would beg you to enter. The feeble rays of a lamp show an apartment evidencing the most abject poverty. A woman, apparently an invalid, is stretched on a bundle of straw with a few old rags serving as a covering. The room is chilly and damp, for except the temporary warmth from shavings and a stray bit of kindling wood, it has had no fire there for months.</p>
                  <p>Kneeling beside the woman, his little hands clasped half beseechingly, is a fair and delicate boy of seven years. It is his mother whom he bends over. Her sharp, attenuated features tell a sorrowful tale of endless cares and bitter poverty, with faint traces of better days. Once she was a happy wife, wedded to a young tradesman. His business was prosperous, he was industrious and honest, and everything went on cheerily as a "marriage bell." Then came the money panic of 1857. It ruined many a business man. It crushed him. It was like a lightning stroke, dashing to atoms all his cherished hopes. He became reckless, fell to drinking, and in a few years died of the delirium tremens. His young widow lived on to repine and suffer. Her needle supported her for a time, but then work is not easily obtained in Gotham. She would have gone out to service, but people are distrustful of the poor. "References given and required" has blighted many a poor, suffering creature's hopes. She turned for relief, as many like her had turned, to the pawnbroker. The insatiable maws of the greedy monster fast swallowed up her little stock of worldly goods. Gradually she grew poorer and poorer, and from one descending stop to another, became what you see her, prostrated by sickness and want, a poor, miserable outcast from society, and now death was hovering round that desolate apartment.</p>
                  <p>Her little son had watched over her with affectionate devotion, now and then earning a few pennies which helped to drive the wolf from the door; and that day he had gone out as usual and stood at the crossing, lifting his little supplicating face to every passing stranger, begging for his sick mother; but the people brushed by thoughtlessly, unheeding his sad importunities, and he returned back in the evening, cold and hungry, to find his mother much worse.</p>
                  <p>The poor woman was starving to death by inches; the boy seemed to understand it as he stooped and kissed her pale lips, and with a resolution far beyond his years, started to go again.</p>
                  <p>She beckoned him close to her.</p>
                  <p>"Don't go," she whispered; "I shall be better soon."</p>
                  <p>"I can't stand it," said the boy, crying. "You are growing so pale, and your voice don't sound as it used to. I am hungry, mother, but I don't mind it, if I could get something for you."</p>
                  <p>The mother smiled a wan smile of affection on her little boy, and feebly strove to clasp her hand in his.</p>
                  <p>"Johnny, darling, don't leave me."</p>
                  <p>It was an appeal that even the child could not resist. He bent over and kissed her cheeks. She seemed contented, and soon fell into a gentle sleep.</p>
                  <p>He waited some time, and as she was very<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC5830-00000017"/> quiet, he thought he would go out and try once more.</p>
                  <p>"When she wakes she'll be very hungry," thought the boy, and, full of noble resolution, he softly rose to his feet and creeped out.</p>
                  <p>It was a cold, starlight night, and the little fellow, who was clad in the thinnest of garments, trembled like a leaf as he stationed himself near the gaslight. The first person he encountered was an alderman, who brushed by him with an oath. The second comer happened to be a good-natured sailor, who was considerably in liquor, but not enough to make him hard-hearted, for he generously threw the lad a twenty-five cent stamp.</p>
                  <p>Scarcely waiting to thank the kind donator, the boy flow to a neighboring bakery and purchased a loaf of bread, and with a heart throbbing with delight, rushed back to his desolate home.</p>
                  <p>"See, mother!" he exclaimed joyfully, as he held up the prize; "see what I have got for you!"</p>
                  <p>No answer came from those pale lips.</p>
                  <p>"Bread, mother, bread!" he cried, kneeling at her couch; "and I have more money, too."</p>
                  <p>The boy receiving no reply, pushed back the covering of rags, and a cry of wonder and alarm burst from his infant lips.</p>
                  <p>The face of the sufferer was turned upward, rigid and lifeless. He was too young and innocent to understand this was Death; she was asleep, he thought, and would wake soon.</p>
                  <p>Instinctively the little follow put his arms around the corpse, and nestled close to her side, and in that position he was found the next morning, quite dead, a smile lingering on his fair, young face, and his tiny arms still clasped around the form of the mother he had loved so well.</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Hoorah for Tammany!</emph>" shouts a lusty Celtic voice; the shout is echoed by uproarious cheers, as a bull-necked individual struggles through the crowd and holds up a transparency which announces the glorious intelligence that the knock down and general fix 'em ward has given some lucky individual over 1,000 majority.</p>
                  <p>It is election night, and the lurid gleams of bonfires send their cheerful radiance far and wide; warming to the limbs of youthful rowdies and newsboys, who are remarkably agile in scampering off with odd barrels and boxes, surreptitiously loaned from some neighboring tradesman, or perhaps the gift of some newly-elected Alderman, who privately instructs them to cheer loudly for him as a recompense.</p>
                  <p>A day of excitement, bluster, fighting, swearing, and imbibing of bad whiskey; and yet it is very soothing to one's feelings to take up the next morning's paper and read the gratifying news that "the election passed off very quietly, and the dram shops were generally closed;" as though every liquor dealer had not a back door, a signal, and a sentinel to give the alarm; as though hundreds did not go in and out with very red noses and unsteady steps; as though the dignified policeman hadn't availed himself of the signal, and issued from the mysterious sanctum with a very rosy and festive look indeed; but I don't pretend to say that the excise law is not observed, of course it is; and then what a day for politicians—what squirming, and twisting, and watching, and plotting—what cunning evasions and neat subterfuges, what grand plots and counterplots! Your candidate for Alderman can enlighten you in all the mysteries and refinements of voting in Gotham. He has tasted the sweets and bitters of political life. He is the candidate of the great, unconditional, blackguard party. He has been assessed and bled, and assessed again. His great political name is Damphool. He has spent lots of money, and all his friends declare, as the polls close, that "he is all right."</p>
                  <p>Damphool is elated, and invites a crowd to the "Shades" to imbibe pineapple juice. The thing takes wonderfully; everybody is louder than ever in their assurances that he has carried the day. Never had a man so many disinterested, self-sacrificing friends. One individual privately assures Damphool that he voted for him five times; another, in a hoarse whisper, declares he told all his friends to vote for Damphool, and he brought a big crowd to the polls, "that's so."</p>
                  <p>Damphool expresses his gratitude by a fresh invitation to imbibe; everybody accepts; fresh congratulations. A selfish gentleman, with a red nose and shrill voice, assures everybody that if Damphool isn't elected he'll eat his own head.</p>
                  <p>No official news has been received from any of the Wards, but plenty of encouraging reports. Damphool runs ahead of Brown in several Wards—the prospect very encouraging—more brandy—hurrah for Damphool—fresh drinks around. Damphool endeavors to make a speech: "I am a friend to the people" —he is interrupted by noisy shouts; another report, "Damphool certainly elected by an immense majority." Everybody jumps up and dances in uproarious glee. Damphool grows excited and treats everybody again. The crowd grow noisier—hip, hip, hurrah!—three cheers for everybody, and laughing, swearing, singing in one wild, drunken chorus, the crowd dance around the Alderman elect, whose head spins dizzily, until at last he sinks in the arms of sweet forgetfulness to wake late the next morning to find that Brown has chiselled him out of the election by over 3,000 majority.</p>
                  <p>The bonfires are fast flickering down, the crowd gradually dispersing; here and there a policeman may be seen pacing his solitary beat; now and then a drunkard's voice arises lazily on the evening air; but, with these exceptions, silence once more reigns supreme over the mighty city of Gotham.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>THE HAUNTED HOUSE.</head>
               <p>I AM no believer in ghosts, though my friend, Tom Trullerby, says he "sees 'em often." I will state, in vindication of my friend Trullerby, that he, no doubt, <emph>thinks</emph> he <emph>has</emph> seen them, when his vision has been clouded with sundry small potations; but be that as it may, I <emph>did</emph> meet with a curious adventure once, that somewhat surprised me.</p>
               <p>I was at twenty-four years of age a married man, with a couple of as pretty children as one could reasonably boast of possessing. Our cares necessarily being increased by this addition to our family, I resolved, with the concurrence of my wife, that we should immediately commence housekeeping. To get the house, however, was the chief point. Peeping at the daily advertisements, one would naturally and infallibly conclude that nothing was easier; and, when we surveyed the generous long columns in the newspapers, teeming with "To let," and "For rent," we were left in a very pleasing state of apprehension that everybody had migrated out of town specially for our accommodation.</p>
               <p>And then such a travelling up and down streets, looking after numbers that we couldn't find, and finding houses that we couldn't get, and losing ourselves perpetually in dark alleys, and making odd blunders that would have filled a volume of comic incidents, besides incurring the resentment of everybody who didn't sympathize with our wants, and who were very unreasonably surprised that we <emph>should</emph> want anything at all. In brief, after a week's earnest search, we gave up in despair, and would have actually pledged ourselves to our boarding-house lady for a year's infliction of weak coffee and saleratus short-cake, when a young medical student, a fellow-lodger, who was accustomed to take early morning rambles, in connection with the use of dumb-bells, for the preservation of his health, reported to us that he had seen "a splendid brick house" to let on very reasonable terms, and advised us to look at it. Of course we did look at it, and found to our delight and surprise that it was precisely just such a house as we desired; and, when we came to inquire the rent, the terms were so ridiculously moderate, that we immediately conceived that the landlord had taken a violent and extraordinary fancy to us, and was determined to secure us as tenants under any circumstances.</p>
               <p>And so, with the usual excitement and breathless delight of neophytes, we bought our furniture, and rushed into the pleasures and perplexities of housekeeping. The house was certainly not a new one, for the interior was completely "old style," with its frescoed high walls, and its winding staircase. A species of ghostly grandeur lingered around the ample hall, recalling the days of its departed glory, for it had formerly been owned by a wealthy aristocrat, who had moved "higher" up-town, though the street was quiet and secluded enough for a nunnery. But, then, the house was certainly a very desirable one; such nice, airy rooms, newly papered and white-washed; such ample closets; such a splendid dining apartment and kitchen; and no horrid basement, where the peddlers could perpetually worry you to death, by ringing the bell above and pounding the knocker below. In place of this, a pleasant front entrance, with two white marble steps, and an old-fashioned brass knocker that vibrated through the house with a ghostly echo,<pb n="32 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5830-00000018"/> that rather caused us to start and smile at our own weird fancies, when we first heard its gloomy cadence. Being young people, in the flush of health, and with minds preoccupied with worldly affairs, we had little time to think of the supernatural. I am satisfied that we were in such a state of blissful mental indifference, that nothing short of a miracle could have aroused us from our torpidity. Indeed, while the process of hammering down the carpets and fixing up cornices and bedsteads was under way, our perspiring anxiety and bustle altogether precluded us from noticing or thinking of anything else. I am positive if a veritable hobgoblin had at that busy moment entered, arrayed in the peculiar and attractive garb which hobgoblins are supposed to assume, we would have politely requested him to take a seat in the hall, and mortally offended the spectre by not deigning to take the slightest possible notice of him thereafter.</p>
               <p>But when all the hurry, bustle, and excitement of arranging the furniture had been completed, and the upholsterer had departed, and we had quarrelled with our "help" on purpose to get rid of her, we settled down over a quiet cup of tea and hot muffins in the back parlor, with a sense of tranquil enjoyment, which, in view of our day's probationary experience, we had every reason to consider that we especially deserved.</p>
               <p>"I tell you what, my love," I remarked to my wife, rubbing my hands with inward satisfaction, "this looks like a good beginning. We have a small family, and scarcely need a servant. You can attend to the culinary affairs; I, to out-door matters, and, if the bell rings, the children can go."</p>
               <p>"The knocker, my dear," corrected my wife.</p>
               <p>"I mean the knocker, of course. Little Charlie shall be the door-keeper, and—<emph>Halloo!</emph> there's the confounded thing pounding now. Both the children are to bed; you are in dishabille; I've got my boots off—"</p>
               <p>"Rap! rap! rap!" went the knocker and its gloomy cadence caused a slight shiver to come over my wife.</p>
               <p>"George, that sounds very dismal!"</p>
               <p>I mentally acknowledged there <emph>was</emph> something peculiar in the vibrations of that knocker. It didn't sound like a knocker at all. It resembled more the tolling of a bell.</p>
               <p>However, I did not then give the subject of acoustics much attention, but drew on my boots with a vexed air, and hurried to the door. I opened it, not as some do, cautiously, as though expecting a burglar or footpad at one's throat, but with a bold, free swing, and looked out. No one there! Not a soul in the street! "Some mischievous boy, I'll warrant," I muttered, and then returned to my supper.</p>
               <p>In a few moments the knocker again commenced pounding. I had thrown off my boots, and was compelled to hastily run in my stocking feet to the door.</p>
               <p>No one there. "Confound their impudence!" I said. And so I closed the door again, and remained in the passage, listening. I might have been watching, perhaps, a half-hour, when the knocker again sounded. It was lower now, but I instantly sprang to the door, and, as it burst open, I caught up my cane to flourish over the supposed practical joker's head, but was immensely surprised to observe, as before, the stoop unoccupied. I went out, and peered up the street and down, without seeing or hearing anything; and, like all people completely baffled, I shook my head dubiously, and returned to the parlor.</p>
               <p>"What <emph>is</emph> the matter?" inquired my wife, whose pretty face had assumed a decidedly grave aspect.</p>
               <p>"I can't tell, on my life," I replied. "I suspect some saucy boys are trifling with that knocker; when I have finished my supper, I'll run over to the station-house, and get an officer to watch for the young rascals."</p>
               <p>However, we heard no more knocking that evening, and I could not persuade myself to leave my comfortable seat by the fire. So we talked and read, and finally retired, without any further incident.</p>
               <p>In the morning the brass figure was at work again; but when I came to the door it was the "muffin man," and the next summons was the "milk boy," and the next, a "postman," with several affecting letters from my wife's poor relations, who were extremely gratified to learn we were "housekeeping," and should certainly avail themselves of the opportunity of making a long visit to us in consequence. I was quite alarmed when my better-half, in the goodness of her heart, began to speculate on the possibility of <choice>
                     <sic>geting</sic>
                     <corr>getting</corr>
                  </choice> all of them in the two spare rooms, with the front parlor held in reserve for her mother and two sisters<figure>
                     <head>BEGGS CONFRONTED BY HIS VICTIM.</head>
                  </figure>
                  <pb n="-33" xml:id="VAC5830-00000019"/> ters, in case they should eventually conclude to visit us also. The prospect of maintaining all my wife's relations for several months to come, was, by no means, a pleasing circumstance to contemplate, considering that my income was no larger than the average incomes of young men who keep double and single entry in big ledgers, and talk and chaffer politely over the counter to matter-of-fact young ladies in quest of dress-patterns at seven and sixpence a yard.</p>
               <p>I dwell on this subject, for I tremble for what might have occurred if I had permitted my wife to carry out her benevolent intentions; but, as it was, my wife's poor relations were treated as poor relations generally are, with vague, evasive replies, incidentally referring to the smallness of our house, and dropping a few pointed hints about the extreme unhealthiness of the neighborhood, with other interesting disclosures, which were, no doubt, very consoling to our correspondents.</p>
               <p>When I returned home the following evening, my wife had so much to tell me about everything she had been doing, and what she intended to do, and how profitably she was spending her time, that it quite drove away the image of poor relations.</p>
               <p>The supper-table spread with a snowy white cloth, and the tea-urn puffing forth its fragrant odors, infused a corresponding degree of exhilaration and cheerfulness in my own breast. I had finished my supper, put on my dressing-gown and slippers, and settled down in my arm-chair for a glance at the <title>Evening Journal</title>, when, "rap! rap! rap!" came from the knocker; so I threw down my paper and went to the door. Nobody there. I returned, and scarcely got settled ere the "rap! rap! rap!" aroused me again. I was quite angry, for I had, come to the conclusion that this annoyance originated from some malicious neighbor, and I resolved to put an end to it at once. So I hurried on my overcoat, walked over to the constable, and procured a special policeman to watch the promises.</p>
               <p>When this had been accomplished, I felt more satisfied; my wife being somewhat fatigued, retired to our sleeping apartment overhead, and I remained cozily snugged in my arm-chair, by the fire, poring over the newspaper. One even grows drowsy under such circumstances, and I was fast sinking into a doze, when the unwelcome "rap! rap! rap!" on the door, quickly and completely aroused me. I jumped up, and groped my way in the hall.</p>
               <p>"Hallo!" I cried, looking outside, and observing no one near but the policeman.</p>
               <p>"All right," rejoined the officer, touching his cap with a military salute. "No <choice>
                     <sic>one one</sic>
                     <corr>one</corr>
                  </choice> been here yet."</p>
               <p>"Quite sure?" ejaculated I, in much surprise.</p>
               <p>"Very sure," replied the officer. "Not a soul has stepped on the threshold; that I'll swear to."</p>
               <p>"Strange, very strange," I returned. "I heard rapping distinctly."</p>
               <p>I closed the door without further remark, and had scarcely resumed my seat, when the knocker commenced pounding again. I took no notice of it, until it increased to a quick, hurried stroke, and vibrated so violently that the house fairly shook. I rushed to the door, and as usual saw no one but the upright figure of the policeman standing where I had last seen him, motionless as a statue.</p>
               <p>"No one about, officer?"</p>
               <p>"No one, sir."</p>
               <p>I looked at the policeman, a stern, resolute-featured fellow, and knew from his face that he would not lie.</p>
               <p>"You have heard nothing?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing, sir."</p>
               <p>"Very good; you may go."</p>
               <p>The officer retired; I watched his stout figure as it disappeared in the gloom, then I closed and locked the door, and immediately returned to my fireside. I was now well satisfied in my own mind that the mysterious calls of the door-knocker proceeded from no human agency. I am, as I have already said, no believer in the super-natural, yet I could not well reconcile these views with what I had already heard.</p>
               <p>While I stood thinking, my conjectures and surmises only tending to still further bewilder me, I heard the ominous summons again. First it sounded like a melancholy toll of a bell, then it had a sharper sound, similar to the rapping on a coffin lid. Altogether the noises were so unpleasant, and of such frequent recurrence, that I called down my wife, and we both sat listening to them for nearly an hour. The sounds at last grew faint, and finally ceased altogether.</p>
               <p>This was our second evening in our new house. The third night we were not disturbed by the mysterious door-knocker, but, several hours after we had retired, my wife<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC5830-00000020"/> awakened me in much agitation, and declared that she heard somebody walking overhead. I rose up in bed and listened—much startled, as I distinctly caught the tread of heavy feet pacing to and fro in the garret above. My first thought was that burglars had forced an entrance. Striking a light, and arming myself with a cane and a bottle of cayenne pepper, the only weapons of defence at hand, I cautiously walked upstairs, my intrepid little wife following with a light. The garret was quiet and solitary enough; not even a rat could be heard. The windows were closed, and the fastenings well secured; so, after peering in every nook and cranny, and extending our inspection to the adjoining apartments, we crept shiveringly down the attic-stairs, hopelessly puzzled, and uneasy.</p>
               <p>Scarcely were we fairly in bed, and the light extinguished, when the measured tread overhead was recommenced, varied by a peculiar sound resembling the creaking and oscillation of a cradle. These noises continued with more or less regularity until three o'clock in the morning, when they gradually died away.</p>
               <p>Neither of us closed our eyes more that night, and my wife declared she would not sleep again under the roof; however, I persuaded her to recall the resolution—expressed my belief that some human agency was at the bottom of the affair, and wound up by promising to discover the cause of the mysterious noises.</p>
               <p>The next day we were treated to another series of door-rappings by the implacable demon, who seemed to have taken up his residence exclusively at our mansion. We got so used to the rapping of this ghostly knocker, that we frequently failed to notice it when somebody <emph>was</emph> there, and mortally affronted our old friend the medical student, by keeping him a half-hour in the cold, under the delusion that the demon was amusing himself with his usual pastime.</p>
               <p>The nocturnal noises, which so much alarmed my wife, were repeated the following evening, with an interlude of slamming of doors and other noises of a strange and inexplicable character.</p>
               <p>I lay awake listening to the measured tread of feet, which seemed so real as to almost lead me to believe that some person or persons were actually overhead. I thought I heard a voice humming a tune, and then the rocking of the cradle backward and forward commenced anew.</p>
               <p>"The fact is," I whispered to my wife, who clung to me in great terror—"the fact is, my dear, we are in a Haunted House, and the quicker we get out of it the better."</p>
               <p>"A Haunted House!" she repeated, "I have read of such things, but never believed they were any more than old women's fables."</p>
               <p>"It is very strange. Hark! do you hear that?"</p>
               <p>There was a sound of a body falling overhead, and a terrible, unearthly groan.</p>
               <p>I could contain myself no longer; I jumped out of bed, and whispering to my wife to remain perfectly quiet, I grasped my cane, groped my way out in the passage, and stole stealthily up-stairs. It was dark as Egypt might have been at that particular time when they hadn't any light, and when I reached the landing I caught the sound of suppressed breathing.</p>
               <p>"Ah, that appears more earthly," thought I, and clinching my cane firmly, advanced; as I strained my eyes through the gloom, my pulse beat quicker, for I imagined I discerned an object: I hesitated but a single moment, then, with a quick, strong bound, I leaped at it, and seized it fiercely by the throat.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Mercy! don't choke me to death!</emph>" gasped a faint, hollow voice.</p>
               <p>I did not relax my strong grip, however, but called lustily for a light; and you may well imagine my astonishment when my wife came, trembling, up-stairs with the lamp, to find that my captive was a woman—an old, decrepit, shrivelled-up wretch, who grinned and nodded at us with diabolical meaning.</p>
               <p>"I've frightened you nearly to death, ho, ho! I'll scare you worse if you let me go."</p>
               <p>"Who are <emph>you?</emph> what are you doing here?" we mutually exclaimed.</p>
               <p>"I see you don't know me," answered the old hag, blinking her rheumy eyes vindictively at my wife. "My name is Stumpet, Hannah Stumpet; I own this property; I was defrauded and cheated out of it by that villain Beggs; I swore an oath he should never receive a penny from it while I live, and for five years I have kept that oath. He thinks me dead, but I've been hid in this garret, and when others came as you came, I frightened them away—ho, ho, ho! The property is all run down! it ain't worth a straw!"</p>
               <p>We thought the poor creature demented; nevertheless we conducted her down-stairs, and my wife brought her some little refreshment, for she was nearly starved, having, according to her own account, subsisted on the occasional food that she could beg or steal. A glass of wine greatly revived her, and she began to talk less incoherently; we soon ascertained she was perfectly rational. Her story was a strange narrative, indeed. She claimed that Sandford Beggs, the reputed owner and landlord of the house we occupied, was her half-brother; that, in order to obtain possession of her property, which comprised this, and several small tenement-houses, he had cruelly deprived her of her liberty, and attempted to starve her to death. That she had contrived to escape, and, to release herself from further persecution, got the story afloat that she was drowned.</p>
               <p>Then Beggs, supposing her dead, took formal possession of the property, and having no friends to apply to for redress, in revenge she had resorted to a bold and original plan in order to ruin the value of the estate. She had secreted herself in a trap-door closet, known to no one besides herself; by clever imitations of the door-knocker and other spectral noises, had driven family after family from the premises, and utterly ruined the property, which had been repeatedly put up at auction, and as repeatedly refused. In an unguarded moment she had suffered herself to be captured, and acknowledged that she was now at our mercy.</p>
               <p>And thus the whole mystery was explained. Hannah Stumpet's narrative made such a deep impression upon us, that we immediately took measures to re-establish her rights. A physician was called in the next day, who pronounced Miss Stumpet perfectly sane, and Beggs was summoned to appear before a lawyer. He came to meet the accusation with cool, impudent assurance; but, when confronted by his supposed victim, Hannah Stumpet, he turned deathly pale, and manifested all the signs of conclusive guilt. Of course he was easily made to disgorge the property which Miss Stumpet, in gratitude for our services, bequeathed to us a short time before her death.</p>
               <p>We continued to live there, the happiest couple in New York, and though all ghostly manifestations ceased from that hour, we can never hear the ominous "rap" of our old-fashioned "brass-knocker" without recalling the strange event which devised to us so fortunate and valuable a legacy as the "Haunted House."</p>

               <head>CHRISTMAS DREAMS.</head>
               <head type="sub">A STORY FOR CHRISTMAS.</head>
               <p>CHRISTOPHER CHERRYCUT was an unfortunate man. Everybody called him unfortunate, his relatives regarded him as unfortunate, and he had gradually begun to consider the fact as settled, that if any particular disaster was to happen, it must infallibly light upon himself.</p>
               <p>If the banks were to fail and stocks fall below par, or the insurance companies dissolve, it was especially designed for Cherrycut. If the measles and scarlet fever carried away all the children in the neighborhood, it was morally attributable to Cherrycut. In short, he was persuaded that of all the unlucky people in the world Cherrycut was the precise type and exact representative. He was so used to wearing the "cap" that he would have been immeasurably surprised to know it fitted any one else. To him it was a natural circumstance that his relatives should sneer at Cherrycut and give him the cold shoulder, or that even his wife should reproach him for his continued ill luck. To him it was clear as noonday that he had been specially born a burden to society as the most unfortunate man in it.</p>
               <p>In addition to other misfortunes, Cherrycut had a large family—three boys and the same number of girls, all possessing very hearty appetites, the only inheritance they were likely to get from their unfortunate parent.</p>
               <p>It is not to be wondered at that Mr. Cherrycut, who was a clerk in a commission house, should occasionally give way to deep despondency, arising from the contemplation of his slender means and the<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC5830-00000021"/> largely increasing demands of a growing family.</p>
               <p>While considering the propriety of insuring his life for the current year, and tumbling off the ferryboat by accident, he dreamed a curious and startling vision that changed the whole character of his thoughts.</p>
               <p>Christopher fancied he had committed suicide; and, as a matter of course, had been immediately transported to the infernal regions. At the portals of the Evil One, he was conducted and promptly introduced to a rather corpulent old gentleman, dressed in tight-fitting pantaloons and top gaiters, who was smoking vigorously a brand of fire.</p>
               <p>"Christopher Cherrycut, I think?" observed the old gentleman hotly.</p>
               <p>"I am here as you see," replied Christopher, in a melancholy tone.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and a d—d fool for coming," rejoined his Majesty, puffing a long column of smoke from his unique cigar. "I could have told you of an easier route, besides spending a short holiday at home. Why didn't you put in a lottery?"</p>
               <p>"In a lottery!" echoed Cherrycut.</p>
               <p>"In the lottery," repeated the old gentleman, warmly. "Buy a ticket and draw a prize worth fifty to a hundred thousand dollars."</p>
               <p>"I never thought of that," murmured the dreamer, "though I am sure I would have drawn a blank if I had tried."</p>
               <p>"No, you wouldn't," said the fiery old gentleman. "I would have put your finger on the lucky number—Twenty-two. It would have brought you a cool fifty thousand."</p>
               <p>"Dear me," groaned Christopher in his sleep, "what an unfortunate man I am."</p>
               <p>"I think you are," returned his Satanic Majesty, and without further ado he gave Cherrycut such a whack as made his head ring.</p>
               <p>Christopher awoke with a dim consciousness that somebody had boxed his ears, and immediately connected that vague impression with the now palpable outlines of Mrs. Cherrycut's figure.</p>
               <p>"Well, I wonder how long you intend to sleep this morning?" said the lady in no amiable tone. "Yes, you'd sleep forever and let your family starve!"</p>
               <p>"I am sorry," replied Christopher meekly, "very sorry indeed; but the truth is, my dear, I've had a remarkable dream."</p>
               <p>"Lazy people are always dreaming," observed Mrs. Cherrycut sarcastically.</p>
               <p>"I dreamt of a lucky number in a lottery—Twenty-two," said Mr. Cherrycut, jumping out of bed and commencing to dress himself with much animation.</p>
               <p>"A dream no doubt, and all it will ever come to," rejoined the lady pettishly. "I would like to know, Cherrycut, if you ever succeeded in your life in drawing anything else but blanks?"</p>
               <p>As this interrogation was rather a figurative allusion to the general run of ill luck that usually pursued him, Christopher acknowledged with a sigh he never had; and before breakfast was well over he had returned to the gloomy realities of every-day life.</p>
               <p>"Hard times," he mused as he wended his way to his employer's office. "Janson &amp; Co. are a good firm, yet they may blow up, as well as others; if they fail, of course I fail with them; bad luck will ever attend me, and it might as well come first as last."</p>
               <p>Having given vent to this despondent reflection, Christopher abstractedly paused before a large window wherein were displayed posters announcing to the public in staring capitals,</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>The Grand Consolidated Havana Lottery will shortly be drawn. <hi rend="i"/>Splendid inducements.</p>
               <p>A $50,000 prize, a $25,000 prize, and $10,000 prize. The only legalized lottery in the State.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Half tickets $10.—<hi rend="i"/>Quarter tickets $5—"</p>
               <p>Christopher no sooner read the above advertisement than he bethought himself of his dream, and from contemplating the dream it followed, as a natural circumstance, that he should walk into the ticket agent's office.</p>
               <p>There was nobody there but a young clerk with a pen stuck behind his ear, earnestly employed in teaching a small dog gymnastic feats.</p>
               <p>"Good morning, sir," said the clerk. "Towser, stand on your hind legs; bow, Towser—give your paw to the gentleman; now then, sir, anything I can do for you?"</p>
               <p>"Have you such a number as twenty-two," inquired Christopher hesitatingly.</p>
               <p>"Let me see," returned the clerk, referring ring to the list. "Twenty-two? No, sir. Twenty-two is taken."</p>
               <p>"I'm sorry; it's just my luck," exclaimed Christopher with a groan.</p>
               <p>"Had you an eye on that number?" inquired the clerk sympathetically.</p>
               <p>"A singular dream did induce me to think of it."</p>
               <p>"Dreams go by contraries," said the clerk; "a friend of mine once dreamed that the lucky number of a lottery was seventy; he bought the ticket and it turned out a blank. Going to try some other number, sir?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know but I will," observed Christopher, musingly.</p>
               <p>"I won't advise you in the matter," rejoined the clerk, "but, if I were you I would."</p>
               <p>The clerk gazed out of the window and commenced whistling with an assumption of great indifference.</p>
               <p>"If you have ninety-nine, I'll try that number," said Christopher, drawing out his wallet.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, that number is fortunately not taken. A lucky number, too. A friend of mine drew a prize with that figure of—let me see—I think it was three thousand dollars. It was only a half quarter ticket, and if he had bought a whole one it would have won the grand prize of twenty thousand dollars."</p>
               <p>"It was strange he didn't buy the whole ticket," observed Cherrycut. "I don't like anything by halves."</p>
               <p>"Very singular, to be sure; but the truth was he hadn't the money to do it. However, he took another ticket after his lucky draw—a ticket of the same number, sir—drew a prize of ten thousand, and so kept on drawing prizes with that same number, until he was worth over a quarter of a million dollars."</p>
               <p>"What extraordinary good fortune," exclaimed Christopher, worked up to a high pitch of enthusiasm.</p>
               <p>"Extraordinary good number, you mean," said the clerk, coolly. "I shouldn't at all wonder, sir, if in your case it also drew the first prize."</p>
               <p>Christopher, in the simplicity of his heart, was not at all disposed to doubt the truth of this prediction. He paid for his ticket, and, placing it carefully in his vest pocket, walked out firmly persuaded that of all the lucky numbers in the arithmetic table "99" was the luckiest, and that of all the fortunate men in the world Christopher Cherrycut was unquestionably the most fortunate.</p>
               <p>Everybody observed from that day, and for some weeks afterwards, Christopher seemed strangely abstracted. Janson &amp; Co. noticed it. Drusilla his wife commented upon it. He was constantly muttering to himself the cabalistic figures "99." He was persistently pursued by two fat-bellied phantoms, that hopped on bent legs and shrieked in his car "Ninety-nine."</p>
               <p>His sleep was tortured by thousands of flitting figures of ninety-nine, his working moments were perpetually haunted by them.</p>
               <p>Never did a man spend a more miserable existence, and never did a man rejoice more heartily when the day arrived that was to decide his fate.</p>
               <p>With a palpitating heart Christopher approached the office of the Ticket agent. The clerk was there as usual alone, with his pen behind his car and the same stolid expression on his face. He nodded, in his stereotyped way, to him. He had forgotten, strangely enough, that such a man as Cherrycut had bought a ticket, but he examined it civilly and said:</p>
               <p>"We have just heard from that number, sir; it has drawn a blank!"</p>
               <p>Poor Christopher staggered and almost fell to the floor in the keenness of his disappointment—the same old story—magnificent anticipations crushed at one fell blow.</p>
               <p>He had indulged in such visions of splendor and opulence that it was hard to turn to the cold reality. He had painted such pretty pictures of domestic happiness, that it was indescribable anguish to consider they never could be realized.</p>
               <p>Several days passed and Christmas approached. It was a gloomy season for the dissatisfied and hopeless Christopher. The sum expended for the lottery ticket would have been ample to purchase gifts for his children; but now, as they came pressing around him for the customary token on Christmas Eve, he had nothing to give them save his blessing—a present of rather a vague and unsatisfactory nature to the young Cherrycuts, who loudly clamored for something more substantial. Christopher was affected by the disappointment and grief of his little ones; to conceal his own distress he seized his hat and hurried from the house.</p>
               <p>It was early in the opening of a frosty night, and the brilliantly lighted stores and<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC5830-00000022"/> crowds of happy faces that met his eye at every turn by no means contributed to soothe his agitated feelings. The fact that he was of no use to himself, family, or the world, struck him more forcibly than ever as he strolled down the street. Why should he continue to experience this perpetual succession of weary cares. "I am so unfortunate," groaned Cherrycut, "that my death would be a blessing to 'em all." As a man walks in a reverie half dreaming, Cherrycut strolled along until he was brought to a stand by a voice speaking to him—</p>
               <p>"Mr. Cherrycut, did you hear the news?"</p>
               <p>"What news?" said Christopher, with a confused notion that some one had addressed him.</p>
               <p>"Janson &amp; Co. have failed."</p>
               <p>"Good Heavens, you don't say so," exclaimed the poor clerk in a dismal tone. "Then I am a ruined man indeed, for I do not know how, when, or where I shall obtain employment. My poor wife and children, what will become of them all?"</p>
               <p>With a wail of despair Christopher pressed hurriedly onward. "I dare not go back to Drusie—I dare not tell her of this fresh misfortune," he muttered hoarsely. If he had desperate thoughts it was now, as he turned sullenly and fiercely towards the lower portion of the city. The pedestrians were pouring along the busy thoroughfares, and many a joyous laugh fell upon his ear like the voice of a mocking fiend. Somehow he began to grow confused, and frequently paused to consider what had brought him out that night and why people turned and stared at him. Presently something touched him on the shoulder; the hand he felt was icy cold, and he shuddered as he drew back.</p>
               <p>"You are searching for me, spoke a hollow voice. "It is easy to seek me. The rich and poor alike find companionship with me."</p>
               <p>"I cannot distinctly trace your form," said Christopher with a slight shiver. "Yet I should know that death is near."</p>
               <p>"Death is near," rejoined the spectre in a gloomy voice. "And he is often kind; behold that dark river yonder which flows so sluggishly along; one leap—a splash, and all is over; our cares, our sorrows, our disappointments are alike buried in forgetfulness."</p>
               <p>"And yet," added a low sweet voice that seemed to speak to Cherrycut's conscience, "There is a life beyond."</p>
               <p>"There is a life beyond," murmured Christopher almost involuntarily."</p>
               <p>"You are not sure of that," replied the Genius of Suicide impatiently. "Do not even the learned admit death to be a sleep which knows no waking?"</p>
               <p>"There is a life beyond," repeated the low voice again to Christopher. "The beautiful green earth—the glorious sun—the myriads of twinkling stars were not formed in vain. It was not ordained that earth, air, water, should live, and we die."</p>
               <p>"Then surely there must be a reason for living here," pursued Christopher musingly.</p>
               <p>"You are mistaken," cried the spectre, gnashing his teeth. "This life is a splendid mockery: man is born to sorrow, as the sparks fly upward; cares and disappointments make up the measure of his days; the only happiness is in the sleep of forgetfulness."</p>
               <p>"My situation is indeed a deplorable one," groaned Christopher.</p>
               <p>"You admit it," said the Genius of Suicide scornfully. "Then why stop to reflect upon impossibilities; your end will be a sweet deliverance."</p>
               <p>"There are my wife and children."</p>
               <p>"You are but a burden to them."</p>
               <p>"I know; yet may they not in turn, when I am gone, prove a burden to others? Will they not miss me?"</p>
               <p>"No," hissed the spectre.</p>
               <p>"It is false," interrupted the low sweet voice again, appealing to Cherrycut's conscience. "They love you with all the tenderness of pure affection, and look up to you in confiding trust as we look up to God."</p>
               <p>"That is true," mused Christopher aloud. "I must reflect a little before taking this step. I may do some good in the world yet, if I am unfortunate."</p>
               <p>"Come," shrieked the Genius of Suicide, who now displayed his terribly repulsive form in all its ghastly horrors. "You must make up your mind at once; this life is but misery and torment."</p>
               <p>"You have something to live for," whispered Christopher's good Genius. "You need not be discouraged; remember, while there is life there is hope."</p>
               <p>"While there's life there's hope," repeated Cherrycut, a gleam of sunshine coming to his heart. "Avaunt, wicked phantom, I will not hold fellowship with you to-night."</p>
               <p>As he said this the Genius of Suicide, uttering a terrific howl of despair, disappeared in a flash of lightning and clouds of sulphurous smoke.</p>
               <p>Overcome with fright, Christopher sank senseless on the ground.</p>
               <milestone n="* * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>"A merry Christmas to you, papa!" shouted half a dozen happy voices as ever chimed in a sleeper's ear. With a start Cherrycut awoke.</p>
               <p>"Christopher, I hope you are not going to waste in bed this pleasant Christmas morning!" spoke his good lady.</p>
               <p>"Bless my soul! I have been dreaming, how like reality! Have Janson &amp; Co. failed, my dear?"</p>
               <p>"I perceive you have not fairly awakened yet," replied Mrs. Cherrycut, smiling pleasantly. "Janson &amp; Co. have not failed, but they have sent us a splendid present—a check for two hundred dollars—and hoping you will have many happy returns."</p>
               <p>"God bless 'em! and thus,"—murmured Christopher to himself. "The misery I have experienced on account of that cursed lottery brought about this dream. Thank Heaven that is so; hereafter I will never despond, for while there is life there is hope."</p>
               <p>The dream was not without its good results. From that day forward he was a changed man, patient, persevering and full of confidence in himself. As the wheel of fortune began to revolve it turned out no more blanks. Every one admitted that Christopher Cherrycut had ceased to be unfortunate and was the luckiest fellow in the world.</p>

               <head>THE GOLD BALLS.</head>
               <head type="sub">A SKETCH.</head>
               <p>THE sensibilities of the million, evoked by the daily spectacle of a starving army of beggars and professionals, as they drop a tear of sympathy, or perchance a penny in the hat of the mendicant or some disabled old soldier, would assume less of the comedy and more of the deep and powerful drama of city life, to cast a single glance within our metropolitan pawnbrokers' establishments.</p>
               <p>Few of those who weep over the imaginative sufferings of your first class novel hero, or the sentimental trials of silk-clad cyprianism would believe that behind the rosy, perfumed curtain stalks a real demon of sorrow and poverty. Yet mingled with the dark and fearful shadows, we occasionally find lighter tints that relieve the sombre character of the picture.</p>
               <p>Walk with us up Bowery; turning the corner at the intersection of Delancey street, you will observe a small door which, by constant friction from very dirty palms, has acquired a dismal and mournful color, quite in keeping with the character of the establishment; push this door open and you will find yourself in a little vestibule; a step will take you in front of the counter where the work of pawning and redeeming articles is going on with professional and monotonous regularity. A long stream of men and women are patiently waiting for their turn, casting curious and eager glances at the articles already displayed before the stony-eyed officials, whose business it is to assess the amount loaned, and to provide each "money borrower" with a ticket, having his name and residence inscribed thereon. The sad and blighting effects of poverty are stamped on the lineaments of most of the poor creatures.</p>
               <p>A thin, careworn woman, whose pinched features plainly betoken better days, comes slowly forward, shivering as with the ague. She lays on the counter a bundle:</p>
               <p>"Please, sir," she speaks in a low, tremulous voice, "I am a widow and have just risen from a sick-bed. I have a family of six children to support. I am very destitute; allow me as much as you can on these clothes."</p>
               <p>The clerk, without paying the slightest attention to this sorrowful appeal, opens<pb n="40 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5830-00000023"/> the bundle with professional dexterity, and rapidly manipulates a dress coat, a new alpaca dress, and four shirts.</p>
               <p>"They ain't worth much," he disparagingly remarks as he quickly rolls up the bundle. "How much do you want?"</p>
               <p>"Five dollars," she hesitatingly replies.</p>
               <p>The pawnbroker shakes his head despondingly.</p>
               <p>"How much will you allow me, then?"</p>
               <p>"Not more than fifty cents."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Fifty cents!</emph>" echoes the widow aghast, "fif-ty cents, for all them?"</p>
               <p>The clerk tosses the bundle aside, with cool nonchalance.</p>
               <p>"Next!" and a new comer walks up as the poor creature in a faltering voice signifies that she agrees to the terms; the money and ticket are promptly given her, and she staggers out, wild and delirious as one in a dream.</p>
               <p>The new "money borrower" is a fat woman with a huge basket containing ladies' silk dresses, shoes, fancy trimmings, worked handkerchiefs, etc., etc. The pawnbroker knows her face well; she is an old professional "habitué" of the office, and has amassed a handsome living by pawning articles; she may have stolen them, but that is nothing to the officials. They are even a shade more decorous to her as they sort over the property and place in her eager grasp the ten dollar greenback she has received for the fortieth hundredth time.</p>
               <p>She has kindlier ideas of the pawnbrokers than that poorly dressed, dejected old gentleman who stands in the further corner as though desirous of avoiding observation. Sixty winters have silvered his locks and long, flowing beard; an air of subdued melancholy pervades his features, which bear the unmistakable marks of the christian gentleman. He is a member of that magnificent church which raises its courtly spire towards heaven, and adorns with its architectural sinuosities the aristocratic Fifth Avenue; whose walls echo every Sabbath with voluptuous opera airs, in conventional parlance styled psalms and hymns. In more prosperous days he rode in his carriage, and his society was courted and craved by the upper million; but financial reverses drove him from Wall street, turned him out of his splendid mansion, and swept away, in the whirl of bankruptcy, every dollar of his fortune.</p>
               <p>The church gave him a cold shoulder and strangely forgot that he was a member because he could no longer place a five dollar bill on the silver plate, and sign donations to eleemosynary societies.</p>
               <p>When all his summer acquaintances and the world desert him, he finds the pawnbroker his best friend. He can convert what furniture he has saved from the creditors, and his wife's "bijouterie," into ready cash to supply the insatiable demands of want, and thank God that there is such a useful and benevolent institution as the "pawnbrokers"</p>
               <p>"Next!"</p>
               <p>A youth of twenty, reels up with flushed face and bloodshot eye, deposits on the counter his gold watch, hiccups "anything you please, old boy," and clutching the pittance doled out to him, staggers away to some drinking saloon.</p>
               <p>"Next!"</p>
               <p>A young girl with a sweet, innocent face which seems new and strange in the money lender's den, comes timidly forward to pawn her mother's jewelry box; and the tears spring to her eyes, as she opens and takes one parting look at the precious family relics that she may perhaps never see again. The pawnbroker turns over the gems with cool nonchalance, shrugs his shoulder at the emerald drops—"they ain't worth much," shakes his head depreciatingly over the sparkling topaz, and purses his lips disparagingly at the handsome pearl necklace.</p>
               <p>"How much you want? fifty dollars, oh? they ain't worth twenty, give you fifteen, don't know as I want 'em at all."</p>
               <p>He returns the jewelry in the box and pushes it aside with feigned indifference. The poor girl is not read up in city life yet; she never dreams that the wily pawnbroker is eager to get them into his possession; never suspects that all his affected disdain is but the finesse of an artful business man, and that the diamond broker will give her twice as much. She hesitates and deliberates, and at last, fearful that the pawnbroker will change his mind, hastily concludes a bargain that consigns them into his hands for one tenth of their value.</p>
               <p>"Next!"</p>
               <p>A boy with a medley of articles from a china store.</p>
               <p>"Don't wan't em," is the sententious decision, and the lad with a philosophical air makes his exit to try his fortune at some other establishment.</p>
               <p>And so the ball keeps rolling. Here is<figure>
                     <head>THE VISIT TO THE PAWNBROKER'S.</head>
                  </figure>
                  <pb n="-41" xml:id="VAC5830-00000024"/> a poor, degraded specimen of humanity pulling off his coat to pawn it. Listen to his fierce imprecations as he receives the miserable pittance that will enable him to quench his fiery appetite in the demon's bowl for a brief season at least!</p>
               <p>Such scenes are daily occurring; the hard, severe faces of the clerks never dissolve into the sympathetic. They are men brought up and trained to this hideous business, and so much misery constantly passes before their observation, that in time their hearts as well as faces are petrified into adamant.</p>
               <p>That bald-headed man whom you see at the counter can tell you many a harrowing tale of sorrow and poverty; but it is not his business nor his policy to be very communicative; so you can allow your imagination to complete a picture which must fall far short of the dreadful reality.</p>
               <p>The number and variety of the pawnbroker's customers are astonishing; clerks and professional men, thieves and habitués of the dancing and concert saloons, sports and beggars, gamblers and courtezans, all alike patronize the "Gold Balls." And yet the "pawnbrokers" is by no means a useless institution. It gives life and occupation to hundreds who might otherwise apply for a residence at Blackwell's Island, or, what is far worse, place themselves under the tender protection of some Benevolent Association. To sum up, the pawnbrokers is a world by itself; a world of vice and misery it is true, but not without its pointed moral lesson. It is the <emph>last</emph> hope of the poor man; he clings to it with the tenacity that a drowning wretch clutches to a straw, and when his last available article has been swallowed up in its remorseless maws, he can sell the ticket itself to keep the "vulture" for a season from his door; when that is gone his final resort has vanished, his last hold on society has given way; he ceases to be of importance or interest to the world at large, and either sinks into a pauper's grave, or forms a sensational paragraph in the morning's newspaper, of some melancholy suicide, that catches the eye and arrests the attention for a brief moment, and is then speedily forgotten in the roar and bustle of the great metropolis.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>THE MATCH GIRL.</head>
               <p>IT was just twilight in the early part of October, 1850, as a carriage wheeled up before the Merchants' Hotel, in Cortlandt street, and a traveller dressed in the peculiar and coarse garb of a miner alighted, and, with the assistance of the hackman, conveyed into the hotel a small leather trunk. The luggage, from the unusual care bestowed upon it, evidently contained property of more than ordinary value.</p>
               <p>The owner observed a jealous watch over it until it was safely deposited in the office vault; then he generously paid two gold eagles to the surprised and delighted hackman, and registered his name as "Gustavus Doring."</p>
               <p>He was a returned Californian, and from his appearance, belonged to the better class of miners. He was about thirty-five years old, with a thin, care-worn face, indicative of much frankness and simplicity of character.</p>
               <p>Almost as soon as he arrived he inquired the time of departure of the Western train the following morning, and plainly showed a restless and feverish desire to proceed on his journey.</p>
               <p>Before an hour or more had passed, two other persons strolled into the hotel and looked eagerly round. Observing Doring in the reading-room, one of the party, a dark-featured man of sinister aspect, turned to his companion and whispered something in a low voice. The other nodded intelligently and disappeared; whereupon the dark-featured man walked carelessly up to the Californian, and uttering an ex-exclamation of recognition, said:</p>
               <p>"If my eyes do not deceive me, this is Mr. Doring?"</p>
               <p>"That is my name," quietly replied Mr. Doring, looking up from his newspaper.</p>
               <p>"You do not recognize me," remarked the stranger, after a short interval of silence. "My name is Christopher Dart. I am a miner from California, and met you at the diggings."</p>
               <p>"You certainly have the advantage of<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC5830-00000025"/> me," returned Doring, in unfeigned surprise. "I do not remember of ever seeing your face before."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry," returned the man, nowise abashed. "It is pleasant to meet old comrades, however, if they <emph>do</emph> forget one."</p>
               <p>"You are mistaken in the person," replied Doring, somewhat amused at the pertinacity of his quondam friend. "I have a distinct recollection of every miner I met at the diggings of El Paso. Your face I cannot recall."</p>
               <p>The frank and straightforward manner of Gustavus Doring quito nonplussed the other for a moment. Nevertheless, after an awkward pause, he resumed:</p>
               <p>"You speak so positively, Mr. Doring, that I hardly know what to make of it. It is a curious coincidence that I remember your name."</p>
               <p>"I won't dispute but what you have <emph>seen</emph> me," rejoined Doring, good-humoredly.—"And if you are a miner it is all the same. When did you arrive?"</p>
               <p>"I came on the last steamer but one," replied Mr. Dart. "I had a state-room with a clever fellow, a companion of mine at the mines—his name is Rigdon. Perhaps you know him?"</p>
               <p>"Can't say I do."</p>
               <p>"He is a tip-top sawyer," proceeded Dart. "The way he piled in the dust was a caution. By the by, Mr. Doring, I understood before I left El Paso that <emph>you</emph>, also, was very successful?"</p>
               <p>"Who told you that?" inquired Doring, nervously glancing round the room to assure himself that his companion's observation had not been heard.</p>
               <p>"You perceive I know more of you than you at first supposed," said Dart, laughing.</p>
               <p>"It's a capital good luck to fall upon a golden ranch and got such a splendid pile as you can show inside that trunk!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Hush!</emph>" ejaculated Doring, turning pale. "Don't speak quite so loud. I do not wish it generally known that my trunk contains so much money."</p>
               <p>"You are cautious, then, and not without reason," said Dart, drawing closer to his companion, and speaking in a confidential whisper. "Miners should have no secrets between them. I also brought some gold bags, but I was wise enough to deposit them in the bank."</p>
               <p>"I should do the same," replied Doring, "though as I leave the city to-morrow, it would be an unnecessary precaution. I am anxious to get away," he added, earnestly. "The city, I am told, is infested with organized gangs of robbers and cutthroats."</p>
               <p>"I agree with you. Gotham is a dangerous place for us Californians. I am pretty careful about my acquaintances. I wouldn't advise you to pick up too many while you are here."</p>
               <p>"Never fear, I can take care of myself," returned Doring, smiling, with self-satisfied complacency.</p>
               <p>"I see that you are pretty well posted," said Dart, with a knowing wink. "In what train do you start to-morrow, Mr. Doring?"</p>
               <p>"Early morning express, by the Erie Railroad."</p>
               <p>"Why, that's curious! Rigdon and I go the same way. We shall have company. Come and take something hot—won't you?"</p>
               <p>"I never drink," returned the Californian, quietly. He did not observe the look of chagrin and disappointment that overspread the face of his companion.</p>
               <p>"You are like Rigdon," he muttered. "I cannot persuade him to touch a drop."</p>
               <p>At this moment the man who had previously been seen with Dart, carelessly strolled in, and was immediately introduced to the Californian as Mr. Rigdon. It was easy to road in the face of the new-comer signs of the villain and desperado; he was somewhat older than his companion, of short stature, with a pockmarked face, and a keen, restless black eye.</p>
               <p>Doring did not like his appearance much, but his prejudices were soothed and his vanity tickled by the Machiavelian address of Mr. Christopher Dart.</p>
               <p>Rigdon was not very talkative, but in the course of the evening he confidentially communicated to Doring that he had two carpet bags full of gold, which he hardly dared to trust out of his sight.</p>
               <p>"I tell you what we had better do!" cried Dart, after a long and animated conversation. "As we are all going the same way, it would be wise to keep together; we can hire a hack for us three, and ride to the depot at half the expense."</p>
               <p>"That's a capital idea," said Rigdon. "Mr. Doring, what do you say to it?"</p>
               <p>"I have no objection," replied the Californian.</p>
               <p>And it was then mutually agreed upon that Rigdon should procure a coach, to be ready at an early hour, to convey them to the depot.</p>
               <p>After some further unimportant conversation, the parties cordially shook hands, and separated for the evening.</p>
               <p>Mr. Doring did not retire to his chamber immediately, being oppressed with an unusual melancholy that effectually banished the drowsy god. So, to throw this feeling off, he sauntered out, and strolled toward Broadway.</p>
               <p>He had reached the City Hall Park, and was gazing listlessly at the revolving illumination from Barnum's Museum, when his attention was attracted by a soft, childlike voice near him, addressing him supplicatingly:</p>
               <p>"Please, sir, buy my matches?"</p>
               <p>Doring, aroused from his abstraction, turned with some surprise to observe, by the light of the street lamp, a young girl, about fourteen, with flaxen hair and bright, intelligent blue eyes, standing modestly at his elbow. She was poorly clad, and her delicate form quivered with cold as she stretched forth her tiny hand, holding a match-box, with: "Please, sir, won't you buy my matches?"</p>
               <p>"Poor child!" said Doring, compassionately; "your parents are cruel, my dear, to send you out at this late hour."</p>
               <p>"Don't call her cruel—don't"—murmured the child, with a big tear rolling down her cheek. "She loves me—my mother, sir! She is sick!"</p>
               <p>"You have a sick mother, then, and selling matches on her account—eh?" rejoined the kind-hearted Californian, involuntarily placing his hand inside his capacious pocket. "Come nearer to the light, child. Nay, you need not blush and draw back, for I mean you no harm. Ah!" he added, gazing upon her mild features with increased interest. "A pretty face, upon my word! and too good to be seen around here! Here, take this, and give it to your sick mother."</p>
               <p>He placed two bright coins in her extended palm, and, heeding not her thanks, walked on musingly.</p>
               <p>In a brief moment she hurried after him, and, plucking him timidly by the coat sleeve, exclaimed, in an agitated voice:</p>
               <p>"Indeed, sir, you have made a mistake, and given me two gold ten dollar pieces!"</p>
               <p>"It is no mistake," replied the generous Californian, with a smile. "I meant it for your poor mother, but, since you have shown such rare honesty, I must make you also a present. Here is another gold eagle for you."</p>
               <p>The match-girl stared at him vacantly; she could hardly credit the evidence of her senses, at this unheard of generosity of the stranger; then, in a voice choked with emotion, she exclaimed, "tell me your name, that I may learn to love you!"</p>
               <p>"My name, child, is Gustavus Doring," said the Californian, touched by the gratitude of the little creature.</p>
               <p>"Gustavus Doring! Gustavus Doring!" repeated the match-girl, earnestly. "I shall never forget it! You have the prayers and blessings of Maggie, the match-girl, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Good-bye, Maggie—good-bye, little match-girl," said the Californian. "Perhaps we may meet again."</p>
               <p>He waved his hand pleasantly, and walked away.</p>
               <p>Maggie stood straining her eyes after him, and watching his tall form until he disappeared from view; when, carefully hiding her treasure in her bosom, she hurried with fleet steps homeward.</p>
               <p>Homeward! Alas! it was a mockery of a home to the little match-girl. Through a dirty, dark alley, up a flight of crazy steps to the topmost story of an old tenement house that took in lodgers at twelve cents a night, and remorsely turned them out when that pittance failed.</p>
               <p>Maggie, light as a fawn, leaped up the ricketty stairs, carolling a glad ditty, which penetrated the lodging rooms, and caused their miserable occupants to start with wonder at such strange, unnatural sounds in this gloomy abode.</p>
               <p>A tallow candle, stuck in a bottle, threw its dim and uncertain light over an apartment almost destitute of furniture.</p>
               <p>Stretched on a mattress on the floor lay a wan, emaciated woman, with traces of early beauty still lingering on her wasted features.</p>
               <p>She raised herself up with a feeble smile as she heard the door open, and recognized the slight form of her little daughter.</p>
               <p>Maggie sprang forward, and clasped her round the neck.</p>
               <p>"See, mother—see what I have brought you!" cried the match-girl, enthusiastically holding up the glittering pieces of gold before the wondering eyes of the sick woman.</p>
               <p>"Maggie, dear, where did you get these?<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC5830-00000026"/> How came you by them?" exclaimed her mother, trembling with excitement.</p>
               <p>"Honestly gained, dear mother. A good gentleman gave them to me—Mr. Gustavus Doring!" she exclaimed, with sparkling eyes.</p>
               <p>"He must be an angel," said the poor woman, after listening to the narrative of the match-girl. "I scarcely can realize that we are so rich. Maggie, dear, bolt the door carefully. I fear some of the dreadful creatures here may rob us."</p>
               <p>Maggie complied with her mother's injunction, and then, kneeling down by her side, laughingly tossed the gold in her lap.</p>
               <p>"As soon as my rheumatism is better," said Mrs. Bell, a smile illuminating her pinched features, "I shall change our quarters at once, and you shall sell matches no longer. Since you have been away," she added, "some men have hired the room next to ours, and the noise they made, and the horrid oaths they uttered, nearly frightened me to death."</p>
               <p>"I don't hear anybody," said Maggie, listening.</p>
               <p>"They are not there now," replied Mrs. Bell. "I overheard one of the men say they would meet again at ten o'clock tonight. I fear they are plotting to murder somebody."</p>
               <p>"Oh, mother! if you think so," exclaimed Maggie, shuddering, "we had better inform the police directly. I can run over to the station and see the big captain. I sold him matches this morning, and he asked me to let him know if any bad characters came to this house; he did, indeed."</p>
               <p>"Maggie, how bold you've got lately!" said Mrs. Bell, with a sigh. "I suppose it's habit, though I am sure I should be frightened into fits to venture out myself on such a dangerous errand. No. It does not concern us, and the mere quiet we keep, the better for our own safety. Heaven be praised!" she added, clasping her thin hands together, as her eyes once more rested on the gold pieces. "We can now start any business we like. I can take in sewing, and you can open a small newspaper stand. You shall be dressed like a lady, Maggie, and go to Sunday school and hold up your head as high as any of them."</p>
               <p>Poor Mrs. Bell! Her mind had become so enfeebled with sickness and destitution that she evidently regarded their lucky windfall of thirty dollars as an inexhaustible fortune.</p>
               <p>She continued to talk and mutter about it, while Maggie, with light step and cheerful heart, moved noiselessly round to prepare their frugal supper.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Ligon Bell was the widow of a once prosperous crockery merchant in the Bowery, who, having waded into some ruinous gold speculations in the grand Wall street lottery, staked and lost his last dollar; then considerately blew his brains out, leaving his widow and child, as their only legacy, a number of unpaid debts and the usual addition of a bad name.</p>
               <p>Untrained in the school of practical life, and by nature shiftless and improvident, Mrs. Bell grew every day poorer; and would have inevitably starved to death but for the active, unwearied exertions of her little daughter, who managed, by dint of selling matches and odd trifles, to eke out a scanty support for herself and invalid mother.</p>
               <p>Maggie could be generally seen at all hours of the day at her post, near the corner of Vesey street and Broadway, accosting pedestrians with "Buy my matches, Please buy my matches, sir;" and her cheerful voice and pretty face beguiled many a dime into her money box, as well as kindly smiles from benevolent old gentlemen in blue coats and bright buttons, who were her constant and reliable patrons. Yet, notwithstanding this encouragement, it was a hard life for the match-girl, often exposed to the pelting rain, snow and ice; but her brave little heart never faltered as she stoutly buffeted the storms of adversity.</p>
               <p>It was a cheerful supper that evening in Maggie's desolate antic, for hope had entered the squalid apartment of poverty, and illuminated its darkest corner.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bell, in high spirits, seemed like one rejuvenated and restored; a brilliant hectic mounted her cheek as she amused herself and daughter with forming magnificent plans for the future. Maggie, delighted at her unusual cheerfulness, listened with enthusiasm, and agreed with her in everything.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bell, with a confused medley of plans in her head, rambled from one to another in breathless uncertainty. At first she was sure they might keep a periodical stand, and, after settling in her mind that Maggie should be clerk, and she the director, suddenly wound off by remembering the "candy trade" was even more profitable than periodicals, and dwelt at some length on the advantage of investing ing their money in that light and pleasant business. From this she descended to "peddling," and drew exhilarating pictures of the immense sums a neighbor of hers had realized from a certain infallible tooth powder, which was sold at the extraordinary low price of ten cents per package. The good lady then branched off in a more elaborate scale, and lamented her want of genius in pie-baking, inasmuch as a certain Mrs. Brown had made an independent fortune from the manufacture of "her celebrated home made pies," which wasn't made by Mrs. Brown at all, but by a vulgar Dutchman with very short legs, who drove a small cart and a donkey in the Bowery, and afterward moved up town in a handsome "brown stone front."</p>
               <p>Wearied at last with her chaotic ideas, which grew more confused and undecided as she proceeded, Mrs. Bell fell asleep, while Maggie with tender filial devotion, bent over her, smoothed her hair, and passed her little brown hand caressingly over the wan cheeks of the sleeper, whispering softly to herself, as contented and happy as though she had the most attentive of listeners.</p>
               <p>The evening stole on. Gradually the candle simmered down in the bottle, and with evanescent flashes finally expired.</p>
               <p>The match-girl, overcome with her day's labor, sank also into quiet slumber, her arms around her mother's neck, and her lips parted in a gentle smile. She was dreaming of golden eagles, and was picking them from the street with hurried solicitude when a noise, as of a falling object near, caused her to start from her sleep.</p>
               <p>A bright light streamed from a chink in the wall of the chamber adjoining, and rough voices of men engaged in earnest conversation could be heard by the match-girl.</p>
               <p>Maggie remembered her mother's allusion to what she had overheard the day previous, and lay trembling, scarcely daring to move, as she caught, now and then, an ejaculatory observation, which plainly proved that they were hatching some diabolical plot.</p>
               <p>As they continued to talk, Maggie's ears pricked open wider and wider, and unable longer to control the curiosity that got the better even of her fears, she softly arose and crept in her stocking feet quite close to the wall. The ruffians, for ruffians they undoubtedly were, appeared to be three in number. They talked rather low at first, but growing excited, their language became more unguarded and boisterous. The youthful listener, with horror, soon understood their purpose. A man was to be decoyed from a hotel the following morning, and a robbery, and perhaps murder, effected.</p>
               <p>"It's my decided opinion that he should be silenced at once," observed a coarse, brutal voice. "Dead men tell no tales!"</p>
               <p>There was some muttered dissent to this proposition from the other two ruffians, and a short and angry discussion followed.</p>
               <p>Maggie gradually gleaned, from their remarks, all the important circumstances connected with the proposed robbery and murder. The place and spot was coolly mapped out, and then the clinking of glasses was heard, as they ratified their diabolical arrangements by a drink all around.</p>
               <p>As yet the match-girl had been unable to find out the name of the doomed; but, heated with liquor, their tongues loosened, and "Gustavus Doring" was repeated with vehemence. They laughed at his simplicity, his generosity, his unsuspecting nature, and talked over the splendid prize they would obtain by the morning. Then they took another social glass; the light was extinguished, and in a few minutes they departed, and the stillness of death reigned throughout the house.</p>
               <p>Long after they had gone, the match-girl stood coiled up against the wall, trembling like a leaf with horror and indignation. The startling disclosure seemed like a hideous dream; when, at last, she had persuaded herself of its dread reality, she crept back into bed with dilated eyes and fast-beating heart.</p>
               <p>Gustavus Doring, her benefactor, doomed to a cruel death by the hands of these ruffians! Nay, she would die herself before she would allow the miscreants to carry out their fell purpose. She must warn the Californian of his great danger at once.</p>
               <p>No time was to be lost. Maggie reflected but an instant, then she leaped up, with the resolution of finding her way to the police station and giving the alarm.</p>
               <p>Animated with this determination, the heroic girl stole softly on tiptoe to the door, and removing the bolt as noiselessly as possible, groped her way down stairs, and so out into the cold starlight.</p>
               <p>Drawing her shawl convulsively over her head, Maggie ran with hurried steps through the silent and deserted streets; guided by her intuitive knowledge of localities<pb n="46" xml:id="VAC5830-00000027"/> ities, she threaded skilfully the dark lanes and alleys of classic "Five Points," and reached the station in safety.</p>
               <p>It required but a short time to arouse the sleepy jailer, who stared in mute astonishment at the apparition of a little bareheaded girl, who stood on the stops wildly inquiring for Captain Jenks.</p>
               <p>"You can't see the captain now, you little fool," muttered the jailer, crossly.</p>
               <p>"I must see him. I will see him," exclaimed Maggie, with energy. "They are going to murder Mr. Doring, and they shan't do it if I can prevent it."</p>
               <p>"Bless my soul, if it isn't the match-girl!" cried the man, bringing his lantern close to Maggie's face. "You are a game one, to be sure. Come in, Maggie, and tell us what is in the wind now."</p>
               <p>Thus saying, the jailer led the match-girl inside, and as she warmed herself by the fire, related her story to a startled group of officials that had now gathered around her.</p>
               <milestone n="* * * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>The morning dawned at last, and as the first faint streaks of gray dappled the east, Gustavus Doring had risen, and muffled in a thick overcoat, was ready to depart.</p>
               <p>A carriage stood before the hotel, and the hackman, a broad-shouldered fellow, with his features concealed from view by his huge coat-collar and slouched hat, bustled in and officiously hoisted the leather trunk on his shoulder; he was closely followed by Gustavus Doring who directed him to place it inside the coach.</p>
               <p>At the door he met Rigdon and Dart. They both cordially shook hands with him.</p>
               <p>"It is rather early to start," observed Doring interrogatively, as he placed his foot on the step.</p>
               <p>"The cussed fool blundered in coming so soon," said Dart, peevishly. "I suppose though, we might as well go now as any time."</p>
               <p>"Of course," replied Doring, in an easy tone. "We can drive slowly down and take our own time."</p>
               <p>"Suit your convenience," returned Dart. "Coachee, do you hear? Drive as slow as you please; we've got a good hour yet."</p>
               <p>The driver muttered something unintelligible to Doring; the party entered the coach, the door was slammed to, and the hackman sprang to his seat.</p>
               <p>He had just seized the reins, and given his horses the word to start, when a little girl, quite breathless with excitement, came running toward the carriage.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Doring! Mr. Doring, <emph>stop!</emph> Please stop, just one moment," she exclaimed, imploringly.</p>
               <p>The Californian recognized her voice, and leaned his head inquiringly out of the coach window.</p>
               <p>"It is the little match-girl!" he ejaculated, in surprise.</p>
               <p>The coach had commenced to move, and the figure of Maggie, which he could barely distinguish in the uncertain light of approaching day, was soon lost to view.</p>
               <p>The girl, fleet as a roe, still pursued the fast receding coach, shouting at the extent of her child-voice:</p>
               <p>"Stop! <emph>Mr. Doring, for Heaven's sake stop!</emph>" And a cry of agony burst from her lips as it finally rounded the corner and disappeared.</p>
               <p>"I wonder what the little match-girl wanted of me," said Mr. Doring, musingly, as the coach drove rapidly on.</p>
               <p>"The beggar wanted money," replied Dart, glancing uneasily at his companion.</p>
               <p>"Money! No, she couldn't wish that. I have given it to her already."</p>
               <p>"Beggars are never satisfied," rejoined Dart, sarcastically. "The more you give, the more they demand."</p>
               <p>"That's so," was the eloquent rejoinder of the reticent Mr. Rigdon.</p>
               <p>"I'm half sorry I didn't stop the coach, and ascertain the cause of her strange behavior," observed Gustavus Doring, thoughtfully stroking his beard. "It's too late now."</p>
               <p>"Quite sentimental, I declare," laughed Dart. "Ain't he, Rigdon?"</p>
               <p>"Awful," rejoined the confederate, with the slightest perceptible sneer.</p>
               <p>"Confound the coachee! What makes him drive so fast?" exclaimed Dart in a tone of feigned irritation.</p>
               <p>They were rattling over the pavement at a fearful rate. The coach swayed to and fro dangerously, as the lashed animals dashed recklessly along.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Halloo</emph>, coachee! Just slacken your pace, will you?" called Dart, putting his head out of the window. The hackman answered him with a volley of oaths, and only urged the animals at a more headlong speed.</p>
               <p>"An insolent fellow, upon my word!" said Doring, smiling good-naturedly. "Let him alone; we will reach our journey's end the sooner."</p>
               <pb n="Illustration-47" xml:id="VAC5830-00000028"/>

               </p>
               <p>"I should like the privilege of slitting his throat!" rejoined Dart with an oath. "By-the-way, Mr. Doring, the morning air is rather chilly. Suppose we close the windows?"</p>
               <p>"As you please," replied Doring, indifferently.</p>
               <p>A glance of intelligence passed between the two confederates in iniquity; the windows were shut, and the curtains drawn closely down. Onward they rolled, first over the stony pavement of Broadway, then along the smoother macadamized avenue, and then again on what appeared to be a plank road. It was growing lighter. Mr. Doring, who had become extremely nervous, glanced at his watch.</p>
               <p>"It is time we reached the depot," he exclaimed, raising the blind, with an anxious survey out.</p>
               <p>"Plenty of time yet," was the curt rejoinder of Dart.</p>
               <p>In spite of the confidence Doring reposed in his two companions, he began to feel some misgivings when he looked again, and perceived that the vehicle had gradually left the city limits, and was now jolting over a rough, uneven part of the road.</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen," he exclaimed, excitedly, "the scoundrel is not taking us to the depot. This is the wrong direction. Stop?" he added, pulling the check-string.</p>
               <p>The motion of the vehicle slackened, and finally it paused.</p>
               <p>"Drive on!" cried the two ruffians, with cool nonchalance.</p>
               <p>"Don't you stir, driver, at your peril!" repeated Doring, sternly.</p>
               <p>"Go on, I say!" yelled Rigdon, with a frightful imprecation.</p>
               <p>The hackman, who seemed in full understanding with the miscreants, obeyed them at once.</p>
               <p>"Good God, gentlemen! what does this mean? Where are you taking me?" cried Doring, frantically.</p>
               <p>"You'll soon know," rejoined Rigdon, with a coarse laugh.</p>
               <p>Doring felt for his revolver, and to his consternation found it was gone.</p>
               <p>And now the terrible truth flashed upon him that he had been entrapped, and that the ruffians had driven him on this lonely road to accomplish more securely their fell design of robbery and murder. He thought of the little match-girl's warning, "Stop, Mr. Doring!" and blamed his own heedlessness in thus unwittingly throwing himself in the power of these men, whose wolfish eyes glared upon him with the ferocity of tigers, as he silently sat, or, rather, crouched, in one corner of the coach.</p>
               <p>For several moments not a word was spoken; the vehicle jolted on—then, with a jerk, it suddenly paused.</p>
               <p>"All right, boys!" cried the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ci-devant</foreign> hackman, jumping from his seat.</p>
               <p>At the same instant the two miscreants sprang upon Gustavus Doring, and caught him by the throat.</p>
               <p>"Help!" shouted the Californian, struggling with desperation.</p>
               <p>But his resistance was unavailing; his arms were securely pinioned behind with a stout cord, and he was dragged from the coach.</p>
               <p>"Now, then," said Rigdon, drawing a revolver, you've got but a short time to live."</p>
               <p>"You don't intend to murder me, villain!" ejaculated Doring, in despair.</p>
               <p>"Dead men tell no tales," muttered Rigdon, sullenly. "You might peach on us. Clincher, just take the trunk key out of his pocket, will you?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Clincher, who had officiated as coachman, fumbled for some time unavailingly in Doring's coat; finally the Californian's boots were hauled off, and the key found therein.</p>
               <p>The trunk was unlocked in a twinkling. It contained twenty bags, closed with sealing-wax, and each marked "$5,000."</p>
               <p>Dart and Clinton breathlessly opened one, and gave a shout of exultation.</p>
               <p>"Here are the yellow boys!" cried Dart, turning over the golden coin with trembling eagerness. "The game is worth the candle."</p>
               <p>"Now, then, Mr. Doring," muttered Rigdon, cocking his pistol, "I'll give you five minutes to say your prayers."</p>
               <p>"Spare mo," cried Doring hoarsely, as he beheld the barrel of Rigdon's pistol levelled at his head.</p>
               <p>"One minute is up," said Dart, looking at his watch.</p>
               <p>There was a dead silence. Doring closed his eyes, awaiting, with the sternness of a gladiator, his fate which he now knew was inevitable.</p>
               <p>"Four minutes are up!" cried Dart.</p>
               <p>A solemn stillness pervaded the entire group. You might have heard the beating of their hearts.</p>
               <p>"Time's up!"</p>
               <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC5830-00000029"/>
               <p>Rigdon brings his weapon nearer; his finger touches the trigger, when a sudden tremor seizes him, and he involuntarily lowers the weapon.</p>
               <p>"Why don't you fire, man?" ejaculated Clincher, with an oath.</p>
               <p>At this moment a vehicle was heard approaching. It wheeled rapidly in sight, and from it poured a squad of policemen. The ruffians, amazed and panic-stricken, turned to fly; but they were all chased down and captured, though not until they had made a most desperate resistance.</p>
               <p>Gustavus Doring heard a glad shout; it was a child's voice. He looked up wonderingly and with gratitude, as Maggie, with a cry of joy, rushed toward him, and hid her blushing face on his breast.</p>
               <p>"Saved!" she murmured. "Thank Heaven, you are saved!"</p>
               <milestone n="* * * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Years have passed away, and Maggie is now the loved and honored wife of Gustavus Doring. He never forgot her signal service to him on that memorable morning, and from that hour became her protector and friend.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bell did not long survive to enjoy her sudden transition from poverty to affluence; her mind had become so shattered by her former sufferings, that she gradually sunk into imbecility, constantly imagining herself in the old tenement house, and talking childishly over the scenes of the past.</p>
               <p>And Gustavus Doring as he looks on the sweet face of his youthful wife, and reads her gentle soul in the tranquil depth of her mild, blue eye, tenderly recalls, though not without a shudder, the perilous hour that first made him learn to love and value the little match-girl.</p>

               <head>THE FIRM OF HOBSON &amp; CO.</head>
               <head type="sub">A NEW YEAR'S SKETCH.</head>
               <p>I DON'T know as you ever knew Hobson, old Hobson they used to call him, who lived somewhere on Chatham street, with a monstrous sign over the shop, "Hobson &amp; Co., Dealers in Clothes." I can't say you would have reaped any especial advantage from his acquaintance if you had, or that old Hobson himself would have been more obliging to you on that account.</p>
               <p>A hard-looking, stern-visaged gentleman was Hobson, quite the reverse of your dashing clothiers of the present day. There was no soft-soap cunning in his adamantine face. It was inflexibly honest and severely business-like.</p>
               <p>He did not put on his cards "Exclusively for Cash," but he came out bluntly and fearlessly, "No trust here." He had commenced life with a few dollars, and had gradually amassed thousands.</p>
               <p>Still he kept plodding on as though the most luckless fellow in existence, and everybody shrugged their shoulders and called him a "miser." It was whispered that he had a large, iron box stowed away somewhere in the house, which joined the store, and in that box were countless treasures, the savings of years.</p>
               <p>It was true he owned buildings and extensive shares in stocks, and lent money frequently at compound interest; that his signature and promissory note were as good as gold, though he did not trouble people much with either. In addition to these recommendations to the favor of the world, Hobson possessed a very pretty daughter, who kept house for him, and constituted an important fixture of his home.</p>
               <p>Hobson was cunning enough to understand the motives and mainsprings of human action. Everybody knew he was rich, and everybody was well aware that his daughter would in time be the heiress of his wealth. He therefore kept both very snug, and in order to dampen the ardor of youthful aspirants, assured one and all that his daughter should never marry contrary to his wishes, and if any one presumed to gain her affections clandestinely he would disinherit her on the spot.</p>
               <p>This threat did not deter some bold spirits from attempting the conquest of the aforesaid young lady, who had just reached the blooming age of seventeen, and was accounted a miracle of beauty.</p>
               <p>But it was soon discovered that Miss Lucy Hobson was not so easily captivated. She was a saucy romp, with a mixture of shrewdness and simplicity in her nature sufficiently clear to see through mercenary motives, yet innocent enough to be entrapped by any one who could read her guileless heart.</p>
               <p>No one could perhaps read it better than Tim Ruggles, the confidential clerk of the establishment.</p>
               <p>Ruggles was twenty, and had already seen three years of apprenticeship and servitude in the employ of old Hobson. He was selected as a clerk in the place of a venerable predecessor who had died at his post full of years and clerical honors.</p>
               <p>Ruggles owed his appointment to accident; he was an orphan and had served a probationary term at the poor-house, where he had first opened his luckless eyes. Here he learned all the humility of his station. He was born a pauper, and consequently was not surprised to continue one; so he contentedly put his hands and legs in motion and grew up a slim, delicate boy, with a great aptitude for work, which was the more remarkable since the poor-house had never given him much of anything else. Expecting to be indentured away as a servant lad in the country, which would have quickly wound up his biography and my story, he was astonished to learn one day that he was to be transferred to the city of New York as the apprentice of Hobson.</p>
               <p>Old Hobson first employed him as a boy of all work, to run errands and brush out the store, but Ruggles began to show so much quickness and assiduity that he was gradually advanced to more responsible duties, and in time was promoted to the clerkship.</p>
               <p>Hobson flattered himself that he had made a good selection. Ruggles was honest and industrious. Ruggles was a small eater; Ruggles was homely, and so it thus happened that Tim Ruggles was installed as one of the family of the old Chatham street miser. The first three years of Ruggle's life at Hobson's was servitude indeed; rising early and retiring late; hard work and no holidays. This was nothing new; he had experienced it all in the poor-house years before, so it came very natural; but one pleasure he derived which constituted a perpetual enjoyment to him, at every meal hour he sat in the company of fair Miss Hobson, whose bright, handsome face exercised a spell over the poor clerk far more powerful than the stern voice or visage of his employer.</p>
               <p>Miss Lucy had noticed him the first day of his arrival, and pitied him in the simplicity of her heart, because he was so plain-looking and dressed so poorly; and yet she seldom thought of him in her girlish days except to observe, as she could not help observing, how earnestly the big, black eyes of the apprentice would gaze at her very reverently, as one might gaze on some lovely picture.</p>
               <p>Ruggles loved her as a matter of a course, nay, he worshipped her, if flesh and blood can reasonably be worshipped; making her his ideal, as all sentimental young gentlemen are apt to do with their idols under similar circumstances. He had contracted a bad habit of blushing and stammering in her presence, which was quite unaccountable to Miss Hobson.</p>
               <p>It was near the New Year, one cold evening, as Ruggles sat disconsolately in the shop, amusing himself with drawing a variety of fantastic images on the icy window panes.</p>
               <p>"It is just three years to-morrow," soliloquized Ruggles in a mournful tone,—"just three years since I came here, and I've been looking at her all the time, and she never sees me. But I'm only a poor clerk!"</p>
               <p>The old-fashioned clock behind the door—on the stairway—struck the hour of seven. Its last echoing chime seemed to take up the burden of his thoughts and repeated "only a poor clerk,—only a poor clerk!"</p>
               <p>"I know it," pursued Ruggles, "I wouldn't remain here a day longer if something did not tell me to stay; but what's the use of hoping or waiting—"</p>
               <p>"What's the use," chimed the echo. It sounded very natural now; Ruggles started and grew red in the face, for the echo was not imagination, but a real human voice of silvery cadence.</p>
               <p>"Miss Hobson," murmured Tim Ruggles, looking up in some astonishment, for the young girl was standing almost at his side.</p>
               <p>"Why, you are growing so ceremonious," laughed Lucy mischievously. "Tim, what is the matter with you?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know," stammered Ruggles, blushing to the eyes. "I was thinking of—of—what a long time it was since I first came here."</p>
               <p>"You look care-worn and troubled. Does<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC5830-00000030"/> father keep you too confined?" inquired Miss Lucy, quite earnestly.</p>
               <p>"Oh, no; that isn't it," replied Ruggles, "I don't mind that a bit."</p>
               <p>"Tell me what disturbs you?" said Miss Hobson, kindly.</p>
               <p>"I ain't troubled about myself," rejoined Ruggles, confusedly. "It's something else."</p>
               <p>"May be its about me," quoth Lucy, mischievously.</p>
               <p>Ruggles, poor fellow, blushed like a school-girl; he was fairly caught by this innocent little question, and stammeringly acknowledged that she was correct.</p>
               <p>"About <emph>me</emph>, Ruggles?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, it's all about you, and—"</p>
               <p>"Nonsense!" interrupted the young coquette, taking up the broken sentence, "just as though my happiness was linked with yours, Ruggles!"</p>
               <p>Ruggles grew suddenly bold, his eyes sparkled, his cheeks glowed, he caught Lucy's hand in his own.</p>
               <p>"Now, Ruggles," spoke Lucy archly, "you know or should know that I am not a bit sentimental; come, you certainly will remember that if you marry me you would not get a cent of father's fortune."</p>
               <p>"I am not worthy of you," replied Ruggles, waxing so bold that he quite astonished himself; "but I should be the richest man in existence if I had you."</p>
               <p>Ruggles was not adroit at compliments, but if he had been the most finished courtier he could not have said anything more pleasing to Miss Lucy. It caused her to color very red and drop her eyes at once. Nevertheless, she believed the youth sincere, and thus the overjoyed clerk read the heart of the pretty heiress.</p>
               <p>New Year's day was approaching; old Hobson was unusually cheerful. It was remarked by his customers that his grim face had never worn a more genial expression. He had every reason to be cheerful. The world went well with him, everything he touched seemed to turn into gold, all his speculations were fortunate, all his debtors prompt in payment, fortune smiled her most insinuating, sunshiny smiles. Then let not the reader wonder that he should, in the very height of his good humor and contentment, promise his daughter, on the last day of the old year, that he would give her anything she wanted, and Miss Lucy, in her playful childlike manner, threw herself in her father's arms and said:</p>
               <p>"Surely, pa, you cannot be in earnest."</p>
               <p>"I am in earnest," repeated Mr. Hobson, emphatically; "I do promise to give you anything you want, provided that it is in my power."</p>
               <p>"Now mind, anything I may ask," said Lucy, earnestly.</p>
               <p>"Anything you may ask," repeated Hobson, firmly.</p>
               <p>"Well, pa, all I want is your poor clerk, Tim Ruggles."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Ruggles!</emph>" echoed old Hobson, staring at his daughter, with a face of blank amazement. "What in the devil do you want of him?"</p>
               <p>"I want him because I love him!"</p>
               <p>"Love him!" gasped old Hobson, turning pale as death.</p>
               <p>He was on his feet now, and pushing his daughter from him, regarded her with stern anger.</p>
               <p>"Remember your promise," faltered Lucy.</p>
               <p>"My promise, Miss," said Hobson coldly, "I will fulfil. Take your wretched choice; go, leave with him this house, and never darken its doors again."</p>
               <p>Even as the old man uttered these cruel words he was touched with a pang of remorse, for his daughter fell senseless at his feet. The clock behind the door clicked with a quick, resentful tick.</p>
               <p>"You are an old man now," the clock seemed to say.</p>
               <p>Hobson stooped down and gazed at his child; her face was pallid; her eyes closed—</p>
               <p>"She looks like her dead mother," thought the old man. "Child, Lucy, speak to me!"</p>
               <p>He raised her gently from the floor and placed her on the sofa. As she revived he turned away his face, for he was too self-willed and obdurate to let her see the change a few minutes had wrought in that stern, marble countenance.</p>
               <p>"Daughter, I take back those harsh words, but say no more to me about—"</p>
               <p>Lucy kissed him and he left the sentence unfinished. She then discreetly glided from the room.</p>
               <p>Hobson sat a long while gazing in the old-fashioned fire-place, watching musingly the flickering embers.</p>
               <p>The clock ticked more regularly now, and to the old man's fancy it seemed to speak again:</p>
               <p>"You were young once and loved as ardently as youth will love. You married the object of your affections and would have cursed any one that stood in your way to blight your happiness. What would this life have been to you without the wife you once called your own, Lucy's mother, now with the angels."</p>
               <p>"It is true," mused the old man sadly. "It is true. If I drove Lucy from my door, I could not so easily drive her from my heart."</p>
               <p>The old year was rapidly going out, and the new year coming in; as the clock struck the hour of eleven it chimed more merrily than ever before.</p>
               <p>Its cadence sent a gleam of sunshine to the old man's soul. He rose cheerfully and quickly descended into his shop.</p>
               <p>"Ruggles."</p>
               <p>"Here, sir."</p>
               <p>The clerk was sitting at his solitary post behind the counter, and rose inquiringly, for he perceived from the old man's face something unusual was about to transpire.</p>
               <p>"Ruggles," said Mr. Hobson composedly, "I don't think I shall need your services any longer."</p>
               <p>Ruggles started and turned pale.</p>
               <p>"I hope, Mr. Hobson—" he tried to say, but stopped quite unmanned; tears of disappointment were springing into his eyes.</p>
               <p>"You have been a good clerk, but I don't think I shall require you any more in that capacity," pursued Mr. Hobson, very sternly.</p>
               <p>"It's so sudden—so unexpected," began Ruggles.</p>
               <p>"So it is," said old Hobson, frowning; "I am sorry, very sorry indeed, but there is no help for it; in fact. I've been looking out for a partner. I have chosen a young scoundrel named Tim Ruggles; do you know him, sir?</p>
               <p>The youth stood staring at him in blank amazement.</p>
               <p>"You may consider him as the partner in this firm hereafter," continued Mr. Hobson. "As for my old clerk, I've done with him forever; I shall have no more such clerks, Mr. Ruggles."</p>
               <p>Mr. Hobson, having thus summarily disposed of his former employee, told Ruggles to follow him.</p>
               <p>With mingled emotions of surprise and delight, the new partner was quickly ushered into the presence of Lucy.</p>
               <p>"Lucy," said her father, "you asked for Ruggles; I mean to stand by my promise; here he is, take him. If he makes as good a husband as he has proved a faithful clerk, I think we shall wish for many happy returns of the New Year."</p>
               <p>Ruggles did make an excellent husband, and that was the way the firm got to be Hobson &amp; Co.</p>

               <head>MY POOR RELATION.</head>
               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
                  <head type="sub">AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR, WHO MEETS WITH AN UNEXPECTED RECEPTION.</head>
                  <p>I AM confident that Jopps, as a philanthropist, would shine in the public prints and periodicals, as luminously as Howard did in his grand schemes for Social Reform.</p>
                  <p>Peter R. Jopps only lacked the essential of being known, in order to electrify the world with his benevolent intentions. It is true, some wrong-headed and prejudiced individual endeavored to circulate the report that Jopps was far from being a benevolent man, and unkindly intimated that if he had performed a charitable deed or act of goodness, it was clearly owing to accident. In vindication of P. R. Jopps, I should state that I never heard any one especially complain of him but "my poor relation," who, being of course Jopps' poor relation, may be supposed to know something about it.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Jopps rolled in wealth, and when a man arrives at that easy and pleasant state of locomotion, it follows as a natural sequence that he should roll in his carriage also. The aforesaid gentleman not only had his carriage and livery, but resided in a most imposing "brown-stone front" which, being a story higher than others on Fifth Avenue, sympathetically with Mr. Jopps, put on airs to its nearest neighbors and turned up its aristocratic nose, if, by any stretch of imagination, a "brown-stone front" could be supposed to own that useful and ornamental facial organ.</p>
                  <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC5830-00000031"/>
                  <p>Mr. Jopps was a broker doing business in Wall street. His office, like most brokers' offices, contained several extremely busy clerks, who were perpetually scratching away with their pens, or running up unknown quantities of figures; thereby conveying the impression that of all the busy brokers, P. R. Jopps was the busiest. The broker had a luxurious miniature sized parlor, fitted up with a mirror, desk, and red velvet sofa, where he received visitors, and where he was to be found daily, Sundays excepted, at eleven o'clock.</p>
                  <p>P. R. Jopps had just reached his "sanctum" in the pleasant frame of mind produced by a good digestion and the favorable state of the money market, when Mr. Wilkin, chief clerk, knocked deferentially on the glass door and inquired, in a meek voice, if he might enter.</p>
                  <p>"Certainly, Joseph," replied Mr. Jopps blandly. "Anything special?"</p>
                  <p>"Nothing, sir—only a man wishes to see you; he is very importunate to obtain an interview."</p>
                  <p>"What kind of a man?" asked Mr. Jopps, drawing off his gloves with a meditative air. "A gentleman, Joseph, do you mean?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, sir, to tell the truth," said Mr. Wilkin hesitatingly, "I should judge he was, though his dress <emph>is</emph> rather seedy."</p>
                  <p>"Joseph," rejoined Mr. Jopps reprovingly, "I am astonished at you; dress should make little difference in our estimate of character. It is the man, and not his garb."</p>
                  <p>"I beg pardon," stammered Mr. Wilkin, turning very red. "Shall I show him in?"</p>
                  <p>"Certainly not," remarked Mr. Jopps decisively, taking up the morning newspaper. "I am engaged."</p>
                  <p>The chief clerk nodded intelligently, and left the room. Mr. Jopps settled himself in his cushioned chair, placed his eye-glass more firmly on his nose, and commenced perusing a report of "yesterday's proceedings at the gold room," when another deferential tap on the glass door interrupted him.</p>
                  <p>"Excuse me, Mr. Jopps," said Wilkin, putting in his head. "The man insists upon seeing you, says he is a relative of yours, and—"</p>
                  <p>"A rel-a-tive of mine," ejaculated Mr. Jopps aghast. "A rel-a-tive—you must be mistaken!"</p>
                  <p>"He <emph>claims</emph> to be a relative," said Mr. Wilkin, positively.</p>
                  <p>"Humph!" rejoined the broker, folding up his newspaper. "He is a poor man—that is to say," added Mr. Jopps, correcting himself, "his dress is rather beggarly."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
                  <p>"And claims to be a relative of mine?"</p>
                  <p>"So he says."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Jopps was indignant at the bare insinuation. To consider that he, Mr. Jopps, the rich broker, should possess such a monstrosity as a poor relation! Everybody has poor relations, came up as a comforting reflection, however, and after a second of grave deliberation he said:</p>
                  <p>"Show him in, Joseph."</p>
                  <p>A few moments elapsed and the glass door opened wider; the chief clerk ushered in a young man between twenty-five and thirty years of age, with a pleasant though firm expression of countenance. Mr. Jopps sharply scrutinized his shabby frock and threadbare pantaloons, and made a sign for Wilkin to depart.</p>
                  <p>"My dear uncle Peter, how do you do?" exclaimed the young man, extending his hand. "This is a joyful meeting."</p>
                  <p>"I should think so," retorted Mr. Jopps, unceremoniously catching him by the collar. "How dare you presume to introduce yourself here as a relation of mine?"</p>
                  <p>As the poor relation seemed quite thunderstruck by this unexpected reception, and said nothing whatever, Mr. Jopps shook him violently.</p>
                  <p>"An impudent scoundrel," exclaimed Mr. Jopps, finally releasing his hold, quite out of breath. "To come in my office and herald yourself to my clerks as a relation. I don't know you."</p>
                  <p>A slight hectic of resentment reddened the face of the young man, but it passed away quickly as he replied:</p>
                  <p>"What, have you forgotten your nephew so soon—your favorite nephew, Jasper Tripp?"</p>
                  <p>"I remember," Mr. Jopps coldly rejoined, "I did have a nephew of that name; but I never knew much about him, except," added the broker sneeringly, "that he was always out of business and living on other folks."</p>
                  <p>"I have just arrived from California," said Mr. Tripp with a sigh; "the mines proved a failure, and the money I invested was hopelessly lost. I returned to New York overjoyed to find my uncle Jopps a rich broker."</p>
                  <p>"Humph!" replied Mr. Jopps, shrugging his shoulders, "while you were prospering, it seems you did not deem it worth your while to drop a line of recognition; now having nothing to sustain you, with no business prospects and poverty staring you in the face, you have the sublime impudence to come to me for assistance. Really, Mr. Tripp, I can do nothing for you."</p>
                  <p>"Even if I haven't a dollar," said the nephew bitterly.</p>
                  <p>"Even if you haven't a dollar," repeated Mr. Jopps, buttoning up his pockets with a firm air. "Everybody has to live, in a great city like New York. Though my income is large, my expenses are enormous. I have a family to support," added Mr. Jopps, waxing very virtuous. "It is the first duty of a man to look after his wife and children. It's a sacred duty," continued Mr. Jopps, with a moral sigh, "that puts aside every other consideration and feelingly reminds me that I am a husband and a father."</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps," suggested young Tripp, who had listened to this hypocritical speech with some impatience—"perhaps you can procure me employment?"</p>
                  <p>"Employment," echoed Mr. Jopps, knitting his brow. "You ought to be able to find that yourself. Now to come to the point, Mr. Tripp, you need not expect any assistance from me; you must go out in the world, and do for yourself. Learn to rely on your own endeavors now and ever. I advise you to be independent of people's help generally. When I commenced life I had no one to assist me, but I made up my mind to achieve success; and it's my opinion you can do the same—all you need is the resolution and the will."</p>
                  <p>"Humbug!" replied young Mr. Tripp impetuously. "I don't believe a word of it; there never lived a man in the world yet but who, at some period of his life, felt the necessity of a friend; you may one day comprehend the want of one yourself. Good morning, sir!"</p>
                  <p>And then, to the astonishment of the rich broker, Jasper Tripp actually placed his hat on in his august presence, and stalked out, slamming the glass door behind him.</p>
                  <p>"What confounded impudence!" muttered Mr. Jopps, so bewildered by the altered demeanor of his nephew as to be unable to put in the last word. "I'll have him arrested as a vagrant if he shows himself here again. <emph>Wilkin!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"Here, sir," cried the ready and obsequious clerk, popping in his head.</p>
                  <p>"If that fellow repeats his visit keep him out of my office, he's an arrant impostor. I'm sorry," added Mr. Jopps severely, "I employ a clerk who has so little judgment in his discrimination of visitors. No apologies if you please, Joseph. I will overlook it this time, but be more careful in future."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Jopps, having thus vented his spleen on his unoffending chief clerk, permitted him to depart, and resumed his paper again; a paragraph of interest, announcing that gold was steadily rising, at once absorbed his attention.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                  <head type="sub">WHICH TREATS OF THE BLOXHAM HOUSE.</head>
                  <p>I am ambitious to record the fact that my poor relation, as a man of spirit and feeling, has opinions of his own; elements of character certain persons might object to his possessing, on the general principle that as my poor relation was Jopps' poor relation he had no right to any opinions whatever.</p>
                  <p>It will be considered by this class of admirable critics as a proof of his low origin, that when he had left the presence of the magnate of Wall street, he should energetically utter the word "puppy" and shake his fist at an imaginative figure of P. R. Jopps which still stood before him with a supercilious smile on his aristocratic features.</p>
                  <p>"Uncle Jopps is a puppy," said Jasper indignantly. "It was hard to restrain myself; but I am glad I did; very glad."</p>
                  <p>Having uttered this brief soliloquy, Jasper walked rapidly through the crowded thoroughfare, until he had fairly walked himself out of breath, and being by this time in a calmer mood, he turned towards the Park. Crowds of pedestrians are rushing down town, and another army of hats and bonnets surging up; Fulton street and the Park are jammed with colliding trucks and belligerent omnibuses. The tramp of human feet and rattling of cart wheels mingle with the shouts of the newsboys and itinerant venders, until it goes rattling, rolling, shouting into the vast babel of omnipotent Broadway.</p>
                  <p>As Jasper sauntered along in something of a meditative mood, he almost ran against a young man about twenty-six years, of short stature, attired in a genteel Russian suit and Wellington boots, who gave him a<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC5830-00000032"/> sharp scrutinizing glance and immediately halted.</p>
                  <p>"Halloo! Jasper Tripp!"</p>
                  <p>"Chester Bloxham!" ejaculated my poor relation, "so you remember your old friend; I thought you had forgotten me long age."</p>
                  <p>"I forget nobody," returned Mr. Bloxham with much animation. "I'd make a good detective; let me get a glimpse of a fellow and I can pick his photograph from a hundred in the Rogues' Gallery. How's business?"</p>
                  <p>"Bad," rejoined Jasper, shaking his head, "at least I've got none myself. Did you hear of my misfortune in California?"</p>
                  <p>"Made a dead failure there, eh?"</p>
                  <p>Jasper nodded.</p>
                  <p>"Thought as much when I put my winkers on your seedy coat," remarked Mr. Bloxham. "No friends, I suppose, to help you?"</p>
                  <p>"I am in the plight you see me," answered Jasper candidly. "Even my uncle Jopps, the rich broker, refuses to give me a helping hand; very kind in him, ain't it?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I should say so; with <emph>his</emph> income, it was uncommon kind; but, Tripp, the world is very selfish you know; by the by, have you any money?"</p>
                  <p>"Not a dollar."</p>
                  <p>"Anything in the valuable way," pursued young Bloxham suggestively; "for instance, a watch, breastpin or gold studs?"</p>
                  <p>"No, my dear Chester, not even a bagatelle of a plated sleeve-button."</p>
                  <p>"Phew! you are hard up," ejaculated Mr. Bloxham gravely. "Why, Tripp, you are in a regular fix; what do you intend to do?"</p>
                  <p>My poor relation frankly admitted he did not very well know; whereupon Mr. Bloxham gave a long drawn whistle, expressive of his surprise and discomfiture.</p>
                  <p>"Look here," said Mr. Bloxham after a brief pause, during which he stroked his chin thoughtfully. "I don't know but what I may lend you a helping hand myself. Our boarding-house ain't very full at present, owing to the hot season. I might sly you in for a couple of days or a week, if it wasn't for the General finding it out; I am afraid he might object."</p>
                  <p>"The General!" repeated Jasper. "Have you, then, a military gentleman to direct your boarding-house and control your affairs?"</p>
                  <p>"Tripp," replied young Bloxham solemnly, "if my father is a General I cannot help it. It was his destiny to become one. It is true as a General of the militia he has seen no active service, but when his country calls, you may depend upon it, Tripp, my honored parent will respond; by the by, have you any baggage?"</p>
                  <p>"Nothing except a small valise, as you see."</p>
                  <p>"That's bad for a beginning," observed Mr. Bloxham reflectively. "It is a rule in our popular and attractive boarding-house, to admit no one unless bringing unexceptional references and a large-sized trunk; the latter in particular, is a first class recommendation with us; however I must manage to smuggle you in without the General and my beloved stepmother knowing the facts of the case; let me see; you had better call about six—say fifteen minutes after—that's our dinner hour, and I don't mind slipping you and the valise up stairs while the General is carving; how will that suit?"</p>
                  <p>"I shouldn't like to put you to all this trouble on my account," replied Jasper hesitatingly.</p>
                  <p>"Well I <emph>am</emph> putting myself to considerable trouble, not to say danger," returned Mr. Bloxham. "The General is a sharp fellow, sir, sharp as a needle, and might see into it; but never mind, you can run your chances; here is my card."</p>
                  <p>The card of the young gentleman was unique, and evidently gotten up with an eye to business; on one side was engraved "C. Bloxham, Jr., 43 Bloxham place, New York. At Home Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays," with a marginal invitation to "turn over." Following the suggestion, Jasper had the further satisfaction of inspecting a small wood-cut of the boarding-house, and the accompanying announcement that "the undersigned, C. Bloxham, Jr., having leased the 'Bloxham House' for a certain number of years, had the pleasure to inform his numerous friends and patrons that he had refitted and remodelled it at great expense, and was now ready to receive guests by the day or week. N.B.—Transients required to pay invariably in advance."</p>
                  <p>"You see the point of this card," remarked Mr. Bloxham complacently. "It constantly advertises the house: throw a few of 'em in the ears and 'busses as you go along, there is nothing like advertising, you know."</p>
                  <p>C. Bloxham, Jr., having given vent to this business-like reflection, shook Jasper's hand cordially, and cautioning him to be punctual in arriving at the appointed hour, in order to avoid the disastrous consequences of meeting the vigilant-eyed General, rushed off in hot haste to catch an Avenue car, and waved a graceful adieu from the platform, as he glided out of sight.</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                  <head type="sub">IN WHICH JASPER MEETS WITH A FAIRY.</head>
                  <p>Jasper continued to stroll mechanically along, and in a thoughtful mood turned into Centre street; a large building used as a paper-box manufactory loomed up in view, and at this very moment a young girl stood holding on the railing near the doorway, watching the approach of Jasper with a wistful, earnest expression of countenance.</p>
                  <p>"Will you have the goodness to get me my crutches?" spoke the girl fretfully; "some naughty boys have flung them down the basement."</p>
                  <p>Jasper good-naturedly descended the stone steps and handed them up to her, while her large, black eyes sparkled a most grateful expression of thanks.</p>
                  <p>She was a young girl of fifteen summers, clad in a neat though shabby black dress, which nevertheless set off her slender and graceful figure.</p>
                  <p>Her features were decidedly pretty, at least so thought Jasper, who inwardly deemed it a pity she should be lame.</p>
                  <p>"Now, mister, what's your name?" she said with considerable vivacity; "you have done a good deed to a fairy, for I don't mind letting you know I'm one in disguise."</p>
                  <p>"A fairy!" repeated Jasper smiling.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir," rejoined the girl demurely, "I am a fairy, though to be sure everybody don't know that; those bad boys, who love to plague me because I'm lame, don't know it; the girls at the shop don't suspect it; the Boss isn't aware of it, and only you, sir, know it; now in consideration of your good offices to the fairy, she promises you a pretty wife, lots of money, houses and land, all before next Christmas."</p>
                  <p>"What a fortunate fellow I am to stumble upon such a good fairy," rejoined Jasper with a pleasant twinkle in his eye. "Will her fairyship deign to give a poor mortal like me her name and address?"</p>
                  <p>"I cannot, because, you know, fairies never give their real names," replied the young lady, coloring and exhibiting some slight confusion. "You musn't ask any more questions, mister, or the fairy will be offended; good-bye, sir."</p>
                  <p>Looking back half laughingly and evidently disconcerted by the admiring glance bestowed upon her by Jasper Tripp, the young girl darted away.</p>
                  <p>"One might almost be resigned to wear crutches forever to use them so gracefully," thought Jasper, as he watched her slender figure until lost to view 'midst the crowd of pedestrians. "Poor little thing, she teaches me in her cheerful way to look on the brighter side of human nature. Ah," he added half bitterly, "why am I ever doomed to be over a sceptic in social consistency and virtue? Give that girl the use of her limbs and the appliances of wealth, and she would imitate the foibles and vices of her butterfly sisterhood." With this misanthropic reflection Jasper strode on.</p>
                  <p>Four or five hours spent wandering round the bustling city of Gotham had the double advantage of improving Jasper's metropolitan knowledge and sharpening his appetite for dinner. The consciousness of depending on the bounty of another for the aforesaid meal might have slightly detracted from the pleasurable contemplation thereof in the bosom of a loss sensitive individual than our poor relation; but Jasper, with true philosophy, cheerfully trudged up town <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en route</foreign> for 43 Bloxham Place, resolving to make the best of his friend's hospitality.</p>
                  <p>It was just fifteen minutes past six, Broadway time, as Jasper paused before the celebrated boarding-house, which for twenty years or more had wielded an important influence over the destinies of contiguous rival establishments; mildly he pulled the bell, and meekly inquired of a tightly laced and somewhat apoplectic-faced young lady, who opened the door; if he could see Mr. Chester Bloxham.</p>
                  <p>The tightly laced young female throw an intelligent glance at the black, carpet bag of my poor relation and hesitatingly invited him to enter.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Tripp?"</p>
                  <p>Jasper nodded.</p>
                  <p>"Oh," said the female, "you are the man as was expected by Mr. Bloxham; please walk up in the parlor and I will tell him directly."</p>
                  <p>The servant girl patronizingly pointed the way, and Tripp walked up, snuffing a strong odor of beef bouilli in the entry,<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC5830-00000033"/> which, with the clattering of knives and forks from an adjoining room, indicated the ceremony of dinner was in active operation.</p>
                  <p>As an interior view of the celebrated Bloxham house, the parlor gave evidence of former splendor and departed opulence. Time with remorseless hands had battered the walls, and disfigured the once handsome furniture. The carpet was threadbare and faded; the sofa and chairs weather-beaten and venerable; even the old Chickering piano had lost one of its antiquated legs, supported in its declining strength by a benevolent music stool.</p>
                  <p>An oil painting occupied a prominent position over the mantel-piece, representing the profile of an apple-cheeked damsel pensively gazing in the face of a red-faced young gentleman, who in turn was contemplating with evident admiration a large seal ring on his left forefinger; these portraits being intended as faithful representations of the General and his first wife as they were supposed to appear during the honeymoon.</p>
                  <p>Jasper, having glanced hastily around the room, was about to throw himself on the sofa, when a deep-drawn sigh attracted his attention to the furthest corner, where a young girl sat, absorbed in the perusal of a book. Jasper sharply scrutinized the small, oval face, the deep-fringed, black eye and expressive mouth, and immediately advanced towards her with a pleasant smile.</p>
                  <p>The girl looked up and a deep blush suffused her cheeks as she recognized him.</p>
                  <p>"If I am not greatly deceived," said Jasper, roguishly, "this is the face and form of a certain fairy I met to-day."</p>
                  <p>"Dear me, who would have thought it?" rejoined the young girl, laying aside her book. "Why, I never expected to see you any more."</p>
                  <p>"The wish maybe was father to the thought."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, no, I didn't mean that," she naively replied, coloring again. "I am surprised to meet you. Do you intend to engage board here?"</p>
                  <p>"I may stay a week or longer perhaps," said Jasper quietly.</p>
                  <p>"Can you pay your way?" inquired the young girl bluntly.</p>
                  <p>"Why, what a strange question to ask!" returned Jasper, laughing. "Suppose I say I can't—what then?"</p>
                  <p>"Because, if you intend to stay at this house," replied the young girl, lowering her voice to a whisper, "and haven't any baggage, you will be required to pay in advance; that's the way the General does business."</p>
                  <p>"Are you any relative of the General's?" inquired Jasper.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said the girl, shaking her head sadly. "I am a relative—a distant one—but it don't make any difference, I have to pay my way just the same. I am in a factory now; when work slacks I have to help them here. I'm a dependent, if you know what that means."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! indeed I do," replied Jasper bitterly. "I know what that means! It is to bend and bow to the caprices of those who may do you a favor while exacting a pound of flesh in return; to surrender opinions and character; to be in fact a slave, ground down to the humiliating alternative of starving to death, or humbling one's self to an inferior; if you are a dependent, God help you, my child."</p>
                  <p>My poor relation seemed to be influenced by some strange emotion, for his eyes sparkled and his face changed to such a stern, almost forbidding expression, that the young girl drew back, half surprised, half bewildered.</p>
                  <p>"You don't appear like a poor person when you talk so fine," said the girl, with a wondering expression on her youthful face.</p>
                  <p>"Don't I?" returned Jasper, laughing. "Why, you make me almost ready to believe poverty can assume sometimes that which it is not. You think me rather independent in my way of thinking, for a poor man?"</p>
                  <p>"Rather so," replied the girl, thoughtfully.</p>
                  <p>"How did you guess me one?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, I thought—at least," stammered the embarrassed young girl, "I suspected from your dress—and your way, maybe you might be out of business for the present."</p>
                  <p>"Correct," said Jasper smiling. "I <emph>am</emph> out of business; anything more, far seeing and discreet little fairy?</p>
                  <p>"Well, the idea came into my stupid head that, maybe, you was out of money also."</p>
                  <p>"Go on, little sorceress!"</p>
                  <p>"And it occurred to me," pursued the young girl, speaking with downcast eyes and quite timidly, "that one good turn deserves another; as you were so kind to assist sist me this morning, perhaps I might return the favor by helping you. I have managed to save from my earnings a small sum which I keep in a tin savings bank hidden away in my trunk, and if you will take it as a loan you can have it; maybe you will be able to repay me one of these days, but if you don't, it won't kill me I am sure."</p>
                  <p>"What is the amount?" inquired Jasper rather sternly.</p>
                  <p>"Ten dollars, fifty-nine cents and a silver quarter," returned the young lady promptly. "May I fetch it?"</p>
                  <p>"If you please," replied Jasper with a grateful glance at the young girl, who, without another word, grasped her crutches and limped away on her errand of benevolence.</p>
                  <p>She soon returned holding a toy money box in her hand, and shook it gleefully.</p>
                  <p>"Do hear the specie rattle," she exclaimed laughing. "It sounds nice!"</p>
                  <p>"You love money, then?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, I like it to be sure, but chiefly for the good it confers," she said archly, as she handed him the box.</p>
                  <p>"I may never be able to return this," said Jasper seriously.</p>
                  <p>"Don't fret; I <choice>
                        <sic>shant't</sic>
                        <corr>shan't</corr>
                     </choice> be very much put out if you fail to pay me," replied the girl.</p>
                  <p>"May I ask," said Jasper with some emotion, "the name of my little benefactress?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes—certainly," replied the girl, confusedly. "Daisey's my name—Daisey Bright."</p>
                  <p>Jasper thereupon wrote, with a pencil, the following on a slip of paper and handed it to her:</p>

                  <p>Jasper laughed.</p>
                  <p>"Fie! my little Daisey. Do you suppose I am not grateful? Do you suppose I shall ever forget it?"</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
                  <head type="sub">WHICH RELATES TO THE BELOVED STEP-MOTHER.</head>
                  <p>Daisey's face lengthened as a portly gentleman with a prominent nose and an ex-exceedingly red complexion, appeared at the threshhold and intercepted her retreat; an air of tragic indignation pervaded the features of the distinguished General as he surveyed my poor relation and his youthful companion.</p>
                  <p>"What do I behold?" ejaculated the portly gentleman in a tone of extreme severity. "A girl—a female whom I picked from the gutter, whom I shelter under my hospitable roof, so forgetful of the debt of gratitude, so reckless of the reputation of the Bloxham house, so unmindful of her own purity as to be found in the parlor alone with a man. Aye! with a man," pursued the General with a withering look at Jasper, "whom I never saw before, and whose antecedents I suspect are far from being—"</p>
                  <p>"General don't—please don't!" interrupted Daisey in a faint tone of remonstrance.</p>
                  <p>"Don't what?" repeated General Bloxham, growing still redder. "Ha! am I to be bullied in my own house by a vagrant, a dependent, a girl whom I picked from the gutters, a girl who, but for my misplaced charity, would be an inmate of—"</p>
                  <p>The General paused and, leaving the dreadful sentence unfinished, swung his arms to and fro, permitting the safety value of his temper to evaporate into an expressive "<emph>pish—sh!</emph>" and turning on his heel, made his exit in a flow of great indignation.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Tripp," murmured Daisey in a subdued voice, "you can understand now what I have to endure. The General is peculiar, he never likes me to be seen in the company of any man, and I shall have, therefore, to go through another terrible lecture from the Madam on account of my impropriety."</p>
                  <p>"I am sorry," said Jasper, "to be the innocent cause of subjecting you to reproach."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, never mind, I'm used to it," replied Daisey sighing. Scarcely a week passes but brings some new burden or fresh insult; but you know I'm only a dependent."</p>
                  <p>She said this with a slight curl of her pretty lip and sparkle of her dark eye, and limped out of the room just as a shrill, female voice could be heard, at the bottom of<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC5830-00000034"/> the stairs, calling "Dai-sey! Dai-sey!" in a tone which boded no good to the young lady.</p>
                  <p>And sure enough, as Jasper lingered in the hall he heard Madam Bloxham ironically salute her as the "modest Daisey," and propound the taunting inquiry if she considered "herself a respectable character," which terminated in half suppressed sobs from the persecuted little orphan, who was finally sent supperless to bed.</p>
                  <p>Jasper was very indignant with the invisible Madam Bloxham, but he knew that it would do no good to interfere, so he returned to the parlor and stowed Daisey's money box carefully in his valise.</p>
                  <p>"What a noble little girl," he muttered to himself, an odd smile playing over his thoughtful face. "I never will distrust human nature again."</p>
                  <p>At this moment C. Bloxham, Jr., burst into the parlor with an exclamation of surprise.</p>
                  <p>"Bless my soul, Tripp, when did you arrive?"</p>
                  <p>"A half hour ago."</p>
                  <p>"Confound it; no one said a word to me," observed C. Bloxham, Jr. "It's all owing to the belov-ed step-mother."</p>
                  <p>"The beloved stop-mother!" echoed Jasper.</p>
                  <p>"Yes; she's down on me because I won't allow her to rule me," explained C. Bloxham, Jr., using a silver toothpick with much energy. "Ah, Tripp, petticoat influence is the order of the day, three years ago she came to my father, a noble-minded, irreproachable gentleman, learning he was a widower of extensive means, which of course he isn't, and says: 'Dear General, permit me to officiate as your housekeeper without money and without price.' Tripp, observe that woman's art; in six months she inveigles into a marriage my unsuspicious parent, who has no money of his own, and is dependent on his son. What is the result? My beloved step-mother assumes command, orders the servants, snubbs my respectable parent, and attempts to rule me. This property is leased by me; I can dispose of it if I please and send her budging, and," pursued the young gentleman with considerable asperity, "if the beloved step-mother don't behave herself she'll have a special notice to quit these promises,—that's all; but come down, Tripp, and get your dinner."</p>
                  <p>Jasper accepted the invitation with alacrity and was forth with conducted into a small dining-room, in which were squeezed two long tables; dinner was practically over, though a belated young dry goods clerk was gloomily devouring the remnants of a pie, by courtesy styled beefsteak, but which might have been more appropriately termed a "Novelty pie," from the extensive discoveries developed by the aforesaid young gentleman.</p>
                  <p>At the head of the principal table sat Madam Bloxham, a tall, sharp-featured lady of twenty-eight, who by a remarkable course of events had remained stationary in the matter of age ten years, and had declined persistently to advance any further. Madam Bloxham painted vigorously in red and white, and were corkscrew curls and pearly false teeth.</p>
                  <p>As my poor relation, accompanied by C. Bloxham, Jr., entered the room, the beloved step-mother greeted him with a vinegar aspect that denoted the state of her feelings; Poor Jasper's threadbare coat was against him, his meek aspect was against him, and the absence of a watch—Madam Bloxham was very observing—weighed heavily in his disfavor.</p>
                  <p>She disliked him at first sight, which is extremely easy to do when prejudice leads the way.</p>
                  <p>While my poor relation was solacing himself with some bits of meat and two cold potatoes, Madam Bloxham beckoned the girl to hurry the pudding off, and looked maliciously satisfied when C. Bloxham, Jr., coughed and remarked in an undertone to Jasper, that the dessert was all gone, for which he might thank the beloved step-mother.</p>
                  <p>"I tell you what, Tripp," observed young Bloxham when the meal was over and they had returned to the parlor, "My introducing you in our stylish and popular house has caused a devil of a row already; Father is down on you; the beloved step-mother is down on you, and the servants are down on you; you are in a bad fix, Tripp."</p>
                  <p>"I am sorry to be so unpopular," said Jasper. "I suppose it arises from my being <emph>so very</emph> poor."</p>
                  <p>"In a measure it does," replied C. Bloxham, Jr., lighting a cigarette and puffing out a reflective column of smoke. "In a measure it does, but that isn't the worst of it; the General is a peculiar man, he don't like poor people; the mere sight of them arouses him to a pitch of indignation that renders him uncontrollable. I have known him, at such times, to lay violent hands upon them. Ah, Tripp, that old man was born for something high, he has the seeds of greatness within, and only needs to be transplanted into a rich soil to soar above the vulgarity of common-place life; by the by, there he is now."</p>
                  <p>In fact at this moment the eminent subject of their conversation made his appearance at the parlor door, and scowling at Jasper, greeted him with a contemptuous "<emph>pish—sh!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"I told you so," observed young Bloxham triumphantly, as the General wheeled round and immediately disappeared. "He's dead set against you, Tripp. If the girl had only let me know when you arrived, I could have slyed you up stairs without his knowing the circumstances; but it is too late now and can't be helped. By the by let me show you your room; you look as though you had been travelling through Baxter street for a fortnight, and hadn't got to the end of it yet."</p>
                  <p>Jasper, who was weary with his day's tramp, gladly accepted the invitation, and was conducted to a small apartment in the attic; a little cot bedstead with a straw mattress, a washstand and broken pitcher formed the entire furniture.</p>
                  <p>"I would like to do better by you," said young Bloxham apologetically, "but I am afraid if I put you in a lower room, the General might object; confound him! To think, Tripp, of my father living at the very fountain head! best chamber; first class attendance; no board to pay, and then has the brazen effrontery to bring that woman here, and order everything as though he was the master; ah, Tripp! what an ambitious mind is the General's; his head-piece is worth having, a very remarkable man, Tripp, as you will find out one of these days."</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
                  <head type="sub">IN WHICH DAISEY IS TAKEN BY SURPRISE AND MADAM BLOXHAM IS ASTONISHED.</head>
                  <p>Daisey Bright was the football of the Bloxham house. Everybody, from the General down, felt it their province to abuse and tyrannize over the little cripple.</p>
                  <p>It was an unpardonable crime in the eyes of Madam Bloxham for any of her sex to possess beauty; but for a lame girl to aspire to good looks and even grace, was an offence not easily overlooked or forgiven; she, therefore, despised Daisey very cordially and spared no pains to humble and degrade her.</p>
                  <p>At such times when work fell off at the shop, Madam Bloxham pounced down on her prey with all the relentless fury of her jealous nature. Daisey was forced to perform the most menial tasks, and even the servant maids picked spitefully at her, for low minds always delight in trampling upon their superiors.</p>
                  <p>Poor Daisey nevertheless bore her tribulations with stoical philosophy; the innate cheerfulness of her disposition made her burdens light as a feather, for her heart was too young and buoyant to brood long over her troubles.</p>
                  <p>It was a week after Jasper's introduction to the Bloxham house that Daisey returned from her shop with a sorrowful face; the work had stopped, and her employer had announced to her that he would not require her services for some months to come.</p>
                  <p>Madam Bloxham received the news of Daisey's fresh misfortune with malicious delight.</p>
                  <p>"Just as I expected, you lazy baggage," she screamed. "The firm has dismissed you because they want smart girls to fill your place. What would become of you if you hadn't a kind relation like the General? You'd have to go to Blackwell's Island, where they send all vagrants; now get to work directly, you huzzy, I want no lazy people round me!"</p>
                  <p>Daisey was accordingly divested of her black gown, and a dirty, ragged calico substituted in its stead, as Madam Bloxham pretended, "to save her frock," but in reality to make the poor girl appear as homely and squalid as possible; yet, with all her arts and contrivances, Daisey's pretty face peeped out of her humble guise as a rosebud from a heap of rubbish.</p>
                  <p>"Off with you to the kitchen, and no flirting with the men, do you hear?"</p>
                  <p>Daisey's cheek crimsoned; her black eyes flashed for a moment, and then a tear coursed silently down her olive check. Poor child! the insult had driven home. It was an allusion which wounded her sensitive nature more than all the insults and ignominy that had been heaped upon her before.</p>
                  <p>Madam Bloxham perceived with malignant delight the pain she inflicted, and followed it up.</p>
                  <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC5830-00000035"/>
                  <p>"You needn't try and deceive me, you artful tyke," continued Madam Bloxham spitefully. "I know what you are after. It's the men; but what do they care for a miserable little cripple like you; do you know all the gentlemen are laughing at you because of your awkwardness?"</p>
                  <p>"I can't help being lame," said Daisey, trying to keep back the tears. "You know I am nothing but a poor factory girl, Mrs. Bloxham, and I wish you wouldn't remind me of it."</p>
                  <p>"Remind you of it!" repeated Madam Bloxham. "Hear the girl talk; one would think, Daisey, you were a saint just come from Heaven; my sweet-tempered little seraph, won't you please condescend to take your crutches and limp off to the kitchen, where you belong?"</p>
                  <p>Madam Bloxham had adroitly managed to send Daisey down stairs just as my poor relation was coming up, and they met mutually on the staircase. Daisey's cup of humiliation was full; to be seen by Mr. Tripp in her present condition was what she most dreaded; she hid her face in the ragged folds of the dress and sobbed bitterly.</p>
                  <p>"My poor child," cried Jasper in a voice of earnest sympathy, "what is the matter? Do they treat you bad?"</p>
                  <p>"Don't ask me, Mr. Tripp," she replied in a low voice. "God knows how much I have to endure. I am an orphan and alone in the world; they take advantage of it. Oh! they will break my heart, they will."</p>
                  <p>"Don't be discouraged," said Jasper softly. "Remember there is an all-seeing One who marks out justice with an even hand; whose ear is never deaf to the cry of the poor and oppressed."</p>
                  <p>"They call themselves my friends—the General and <emph>her</emph>."</p>
                  <p>"It is hard to receive favors and surrender one's self-respect," rejoined Jasper feelingly. "It is doubly difficult to be grateful towards those who may do you a kindness in one breath and trample upon you in the next. I have suffered all you have experienced, but I can submit patiently to insult and even abuse, because I know my heart is right and I have done nothing to deserve it."</p>
                  <p>Daisey glanced admiringly in his calm face; a bright smile sparkled through her tears.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Tripp, thank you for your kind advice. I hope I shall profit by it. I won't be discouraged."</p>
                  <p>"That's right, my little fairy, go to your work and let no more tears dim those pretty eyes."</p>
                  <p>"What an odd idea," thought Daisey, as she descended to the kitchen. "Daisey's eyes pretty—who would believe it?"</p>
                  <p>No one had over spoken of her eyes before but Madam Bloxham, who compared them to eat's eyes; poor puzzled Daisey was not quite sure but that Madam Bloxham might be correct and Mr. Tripp very partial, and so she went to work as busy as a bee, scouring the brass kettles and saucepans until they reflected back her own radiant image.</p>
                  <p>That same evening, just as the dinner had been concluded, a thick set old gentleman, with beetle eyebrows, stopped before the celebrated boarding-house and inquired for Madam Bloxham.</p>
                  <p>"The stranger having glanced at a handsome gold watch, almost simultaneous with the inquiry, the apoplectic maid immediately conceived a profound veneration for the visitor, and deferentially convoyed him to the parlor, reporting to the Madam that an elegant gentleman was waiting to see her.</p>
                  <p>"An applicant for board, I presume," remarked Madam Bloxham complacently; so she sailed in the room with a bland bow, and most gracious smile.</p>
                  <p>"Is this Mrs. Bloxham?"</p>
                  <p>"It is."</p>
                  <p>"I believe a young lady named Daisey Bright boards here," pursued the stranger, looking inside his beaver abstractedly.</p>
                  <p>"No, sir," replied Madam Bloxham rather tartly. "We have no <emph>boarders</emph> by that name, but a girl called Daisey Bright is staying with us, whom the General, out of the superabundance of his big heart, picked from the gutters. Do you wish to see Daisey, sir?"</p>
                  <p>The stranger nodded coldly.</p>
                  <p>"Certainly I wish to see her; my business is with her entirely."</p>
                  <p>Madam Bloxham was confounded. Business with Daisey—what in the world did he want of her? The Madam's astonishment visibly increased when the visitor introduced himself as Mr. Q. R. Links—a lawyer—and hinted he had good news for the aforesaid young lady.</p>
                  <p>And what astonishing news it was that made Mrs. Bloxham nearly drop from her chair, and tremble all over as if in an ague! That made C. Bloxham, Jr., fly like a madman down into the kitchen after the modern Cinderella, and vow she was the luckiest girl in the big city of Gotham. That caused all the servant maids to open their eyes and mouths in gaping wonder, and startle even the thirty fashionable inmates of Bloxham's stylish boarding-house. In some way, incredible to believe and yet true, Daisey Bright had unexpectedly come into possession of a handsome fortune.</p>
                  <p>Madam Bloxham was in hysterics! The General in a glow of honest pride and self-elation, and C. Bloxham, Jr., almost beside himself with excitement.</p>
                  <p>Daisey was hurried from the kitchen, where she had been busy scouring a sooty kettle, and received the intelligence like one in a dream. The bewildered girl was hastily indoctrinated into one of Madam Bloxham's dresses, which, being a trifle too long in the arms, was rolled up in a form that closely resembled a pair of boxing-gloves; her long, black hair deluged with a compound, used by Madam B. and known by the name of "Hyperion Fluid," which gave the young lady a decidedly moist and mermaid like appearance. What with the long dress, that nearly tripped her off her crutches, and the astounding news, poor Daisey looked like a lamb led to the slaughter, or a criminal on the eve of being executed.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Links being introduced by C. Bloxham, Jr., to the young lady, smilingly acquainted her with the fact that he was her guardian, and that she had become heir to a large sum of money, the specific amount of which he was not permitted to divulge, until the young lady had attained the legal age of eighteen. To confirm this statement of her good fortune Mr. Links drew from his wallet a roll of bank bills which he handed her with the incidental observation that if she wanted any further advances, to call at his office at 8 Park row, where he would be happy to see her at any hour in the day after 11 A. M.</p>
                  <p>Daisey, with a pale, subdued face, received the money in silence, which C. Bloxham, Jr., officiously proceeded to count, informing her in a loud whisper that it amounted to the unconscionable sum of five hundred dollars.</p>
                  <p>The sight of the greenbacks was too much for the big-hearted General, who had watched the proceedings from a chink in the door, and now came forward with extended arms and nearly smothered Daisey in the ample folds of his benevolent waistcoat.</p>
                  <p>"My dearest Daisey," ejaculated the General impressively, "I congratulate you—warmly congratulate you!"</p>
                  <p>Daisey struggled hopelessly in the arms of the eminent General until Mr. Links came to her relief and pushed him off.</p>
                  <p>"This is the proudest hour of my life," said General Bloxham, waving his hand deprecatingly towards Mr. Links. "To think that my Daisey, the girl I picked from a—little streamlet; the girl whom I have watched with even parental solicitude; whom I have cherished as the apple of my eye and the core of my heart, should come into—Chester, my boy, do you remember my remarkable prediction?"</p>
                  <p>C. Bloxham, Jr., coughed slightly, and admitted that he <emph>did</emph> remember something of the kind.</p>
                  <p>"I predicted that girl would one day come into property," pursued the General; "and the prediction is verified; I appeal to Madam Bloxham, if I have not been the tenderest of fathers to Daisey?"</p>
                  <p>The beloved step-mother commenced shedding tears, and averred with much solemnity, which was very affecting to witness, that the General had trained Daisey up like a green bay tree, and educated her at the public expense, and reared her as a moral, well-behaved young lady; which she hoped she was, and would forever remain; more she would have added, but Mr. Links exhibiting evident disgust, and rising to leave, she put her handkerchief to her eyes and discreetly remained in that attitude until he had taken his departure.</p>
                  <p>In reality Madam Bloxham was ready to expire with envy and malicious rage at the extraordinary good fortune of Daisey. There was no help for it, however, and she began endeavoring to repair the serious breaches made, hoping in the end to win the good opinion of the new-fledged heiress.</p>
                  <p>C. Bloxham, Jr., who was always keenly alive to self-interest, no sooner bowed the lawyer out than he managed to get Daisey in a corner, and made her the offer of two vacant front rooms on the first floor, which Daisey good-naturedly accepted at an exorbitant price. Having consummated this sharp bargain, C. Bloxham, Jr., and his eminent parent severally bade her good evening in a series of congratulatory handshaking, which lasted so long and was so often renewed by the ardent, enthusiastic General, that Daisey rejoiced when she was left to herself; and like a child no longer<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC5830-00000036"/> under restraint, laughed and cried in a breath until she fell asleep, dreaming she was in a golden cave, and that countless treasures were showering upon her.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
                  <head type="sub">WHICH REFERS TO P. R. JOPPS AND HIS MYSTERIOUS VISITOR.</head>
                  <p>The office of P. R. Jopps was the scene of great excitement; crowds of speculators were elbowing themselves in, eagerly inquiring for the broker, but the glass door of his private sanctum was firmly closed against all intruders. A financial crisis had arrived. The money market was in a panic, gold had gone down with a rush, and it was reported that P. R. Jopps had gone down with the gold.</p>
                  <p>As it happened, people were thronging the office busily discussing the great event; some sad from the sympathy of mutual interests, some happy at the thought of having nothing to lose, and others maliciously delighted that the house of Jopps had fallen, and the pride of Jopps toppled alongside of it. Certain it was, for once the shrewd broker had been outwitted by sharper rogues than himself, and that a million or so had gone overboard and sank with his hopes.</p>
                  <p>And all through that terrible, never to be forgotten Black Friday, when men pressed in one wild, <choice>
                        <sic>tumultous</sic>
                        <corr>tumultuous</corr>
                     </choice> mass through the Gold Room, screaming with the frenzy of demons, some cursing the day which gave them birth, and others hurling maledictions on the heads of those who had wrought their misery, one man crept into his office and sank into a chair so overcome by the terrible disaster which had overtaken him, that marble could not have been more white and rigid than his face. And no wonder; he who had made gold his idol and the accumulation of wealth the purpose and aim of his life, who had toiled for years to fill his coffers, and in one single day beheld it wrested from his grasp, was not the one to bear adversity with resignation or meet it with fortitude; he knew that every dollar of his princely fortune had gone; that while others, less eager and more prudent than he, had saved a fragment from the glittering wreck, his all sunk in the great tempest raging around him. The splendid mansion, the costly equipages, the retinue of obsequious menials, the pile of greenbacks, and valuable real-estate,—all swept away by the fierce Demon of Speculation! He remembered his wife and daughters, now flung homeless and dependent on the cold world; he brought back the image of his poor relation as he entered to claim his sympathy and bounty, and vividly his parting words came home to him now: "You may see the day when you will comprehend the want of a friend," and he knew that day had arrived. How many friends could he, P. R. Jopps, claim now? His coldness, his selfishness, his avarice and pride had driven dozens of men away long ago, who might have lightened the frightful burden pressing him down, but who would now rejoice over his great calamity.</p>
                  <p>Absorbed in the contemplation of his misfortune, the broker did not observe the entrance of a stranger, who had approached quite close to him; indeed such was the apathy of P. R. Jopps, at that especial moment, that, had the visitor been so maliciously inclined, he might have taken off the hat of the great man and profanely kicked it in the furthest corner without arousing him in the least. As it was, the stranger was obliged to tap him on the shoulder, and with a start P. R. Jopps came into the world again. The visitor's figure was enveloped in a cloak and his features partially concealed by a slouched hat; altogether he was a mysterious-looking personage, and at any other time might have caused Mr. Jopps a slight sensation of uneasiness.</p>
                  <p>"Who are you, and what do you want?" inquired the broker, recovering from his momentary surprise.</p>
                  <p>The stranger seemed rather averse to answering this double interrogatory, for after a short interval of silence he said:</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Jopps, there are times when a gentleman, like you, might not be offended to receive a visit from a friend. I am one."</p>
                  <p>"A friend!" echoed the amazed Mr. Jopps. His first impulse was to rise and show the visitor the door; the second—and Mr. Jopps' late misfortune had somewhat subdued the arrogance of his temper—was to point to a seat, which the stranger accepted at once.</p>
                  <p>"I have come as a friend," repeated the stranger, whose voice was low and earnest. "If report speaks true you are a bankrupt, Mr. Jopps; you have lost everything."</p>
                  <p>"Everything except honor," replied the broker with a dejected air; "but, sir," he added haughtily: "Is it for this purpose you have forced yourself in my office to insult me in my misery?"</p>
                  <p>"God forbid I should take such an advantage of any one," replied the stranger courteously. "My errand is far different; it is a mission of mercy and benevolence. The money crisis which has ruined others as well as yourself has not harmed me; I am rich in this world's goods, but I am not sure but it may be swept away some day, as yours has been."</p>
                  <p>"May I ask your name?" exclaimed Mr. Jopps in great surprise.</p>
                  <p>The stranger smiled.</p>
                  <p>"I prefer for the present not to give my name; you already divine the object of my visit. To be suddenly deprived of wealth is a great affliction; but when the calamity is in your case so overwhelming, it falls as the lightning of heaven descends to blast and destroy. You have a family, Mr. Jopps?"</p>
                  <p>"I have," replied the fallen broker, bowing his head sadly, with more feeling than he had ever before displayed.</p>
                  <p>"Pardon me," pursued the stranger, "for recalling so delicate a theme. You have a wife and children; they will doubly feel your reverses; for their sake as well as yours accept a stranger's gift."</p>
                  <p>The visitor arose as he said this, drew from beneath the folds of his cloak a heavy, plethoric-looking bag, which he deliberately placed on the broker's desk, and without further explanation bowed courteously to him and retired as quietly as he had entered.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Jopps for a few moments remained spellbound in his chair; recovering at last from his astonishment, he examined the contents of the bag. It was crammed full of golden eagles, a sight which even in palmy days would have enraptured the heart of the avaricious broker, and which he now hailed with a thrill of unspeakable gratitude and joy.</p>
                  <p>But who was this mysterious visitor, and what could be the object of this unheard of generosity to a stranger? The singularity of his introduction, the manifest sympathy he had expressed for him, and, lastly, his munificent gift, puzzled Mr. Jopps profoundly. The more he thought over it the more bewildered he grew. In the midst of his conjectures and surmises, Wilkin, the chief clerk, thrust in his head with an apologetic air.</p>
                  <p>"Come in, Joseph," said Mr. Jopps quite cheerfully.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Jopps, I'm sorry to disobey orders, sir, but I couldn't keep <emph>that</emph> man out; he would force himself in; here is a note for you, sir."</p>
                  <p>"Very good, Joseph, you may go."</p>
                  <p>The envelope was hastily broken open, and Mr. Jopps read the following:</p>
                  <q>
                     <floatingText>
                        <body>

                              <p>"Should Mr. Jopps eventually find himself in need of further pecuniary aid, let him not hesitate to drop a line to</p>
                              <closer>
                                 <signed>J. MALLOW."</signed>

                           </div>
                        </body>
                     </floatingText>
                  </q>
                  <p>"Mallow," repeated Mr. Jopps to himself; "I never heard of the name before; why he should take such an interest in me I cannot understand. It's a mystery!"</p>
                  <p>After some reflection Mr. Jopps wrote a brief reply to J. Mallow, thanking him in grateful and courteous terms for his extravagant generosity to a stranger, and further requesting the favor of an interview.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Jopps anxiously looked for an answer, but none came; he, however, consoled himself with the assurance that he had a friend, who, in this delicate way, had spared him the humiliation of poverty's dire extreme, and when the crash came, as come it did, and the splendid mansion and costly furniture of the fallen millionaire went under the hammer, people wondered that Mr. Jopps still walked erect and looked as unconcerned as though nothing had happened.</p>
                  <p>P. R. Jopps was buoyed up with a hope that ere many months he might find in the mysterious Mr. Mallow a friend who would give him a start again, for now it had come so sorely home to him—he felt that a friend in adversity is a pleasant thing to possess, and that there are episodes in the life of every man wherein he finds his burdens too heavy to bear, and gladly accepts the hand of generous sympathy to lighten his weary load and guide him safely through his perilous journey.</p>
                  <p>In this we behold the inconsistency of human professions! The haughty aristocrat Jopps, who had talked homilies to my poor relation, was not averse to receive assistance from a stranger; clutching at the proffered help as a drowning man catches at a straw, though the straw which P. R. Jopps grasped was strong enough to keep him on the surface, while hundreds sank around him to rise no more.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">IN WHICH DAISEY IS INTERVIEWED BY MY POOR RELATION.</head>
                  <p>Mr. Links was a very thoughtful guardian, and early the next day sent to the Bloxham house a complete wardrobe for the young heiress, not forgetting a pair of new and costly crutches.</p>
                  <p>Madam Bloxham, unable to relinquish her old habit of domineering over Daisey, contented herself, on this occasion, by allowing her malice to evaporate in slight skirmishing operations, such as holding back special messages until the last gun fire, and considerately despatching small boys, with huge, unknown parcels three or four blocks above in search of mythical young ladies who dwelt nowhere in particular.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding these spiteful demonstrations, the presents from her guardian poured in thick and fast. Now it was a pretty hat with rich and costly trimmings, or a beautiful silk dress which, by a curious combination of chances, fitted her exactly; and then again the daintiest little boots that ever enclosed mortal feet.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Links had such wonderful taste in his selections, such uncommon tact and ingenuity, that Daisey was breathless with admiration and delight. The guardian's thoughtful and judicious mind had comprehended every possible want, and anticipated every wish of his youthful ward. When Daisey finally stepped out of her room, dressed in fashion's regalia, gliding along on her new crutches as though they were designed merely for ornament, looking so superb that you might have compared her to a magnolia in full bloom, my poor relation, who had been lingering in the hall to congratulate her on her good fortune, impulsively clapped his hands and declared the factory girl had been eclipsed by the new-fledged heiress.</p>
                  <p>A deep blush suffused the face of Daisey as she recognized Jasper.</p>
                  <p>"Why, my little Daisey, what shall I say?" he cried enthusiastically, seizing her hands and holding them in his own with genuine delight.</p>
                  <p>"It isn't necessary to say a word," replied Daisey smiling. "Your face expresses everything. Oh, Mr. Tripp, do you know I am afraid I shall forget myself, I am so happy and so proud."</p>
                  <p>"Do you feel proud, Daisey—too proud, for instance, to forget old friends?"</p>
                  <p>"No, no," replied Daisey, with a beaming expression of sympathy on her sweet face. "It wouldn't be me, it wouldn't be Daisey to turn her back on those who have spoken kind words to her in adversity. Mr. Tripp," she added naively, "perhaps, you'd like a loan?"</p>
                  <p>"I am indebted to you already, my generous fairy."</p>
                  <p>"Never mind about that; I've got a full purse, so help yourself," she said laughingly.</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps your guardian may have something to say about wasting your money," remarked my poor relation gravely.</p>
                  <p>"My guardian need know nothing about it," said Daisey very earnestly.</p>
                  <p>"Did it ever occur to you, Daisey, that I am too honorable to take advantage of your generosity; I cannot go beyond the loan which you so kindly advanced when I was in greater need than now. Could you ever suppose, in fact, that I might be too proud to accept it?"</p>
                  <p>"I never thought anything about it, I'm sure," said Daisey, puzzled and surprised. "You are a strange man, Mr. Tripp, so different from the rest of the world."</p>
                  <p>"In what respect?" inquired Jasper, laughing.</p>
                  <p>"You are so odd in your opinions, so independent and proud; though I will confess I like you all the better for it. There's the General, for instance, he's so different from you—so is Madam Bloxham; they are all as smiling to me now as a basket of chips, but I know the smiles are not intended for Miss Daisey exactly. It seems to me, Mr. Tripp, as though people who have been rich all their lifetime cannot understand human nature as well as a poor girl like me, and I know by experience that the pleasant treatment I receive is hypocrisy after all."</p>
                  <p>"Sensibly spoken, my little Daisey," replied Jasper, approvingly. "You know what their smiles and professions mean; but when you come to listen to flattery—and flattery is a very pleasant thing to hear, even when we know it is such—do you think your little head will not grow dizzy and be turned one of these days?"</p>
                  <p>"I have read in some ancient history book," replied Daisey archly, "about a celebrated warrior, who had a man at his elbow to occasionally whisper in his ear when surrounded with flatterers, "Remember you are but mortal;" and while I have a good friend to advise me I shan't fear about my head being turned, especially when he is near, though I feel very proud, Mr. Tripp, and almost fancy I'm floating on clouds already."</p>
                  <p>"You talk like a princess, my pretty Daisey."</p>
                  <p>It was at this stage of their conversation that Jasper and his young companion were considerably startled by a loud "<emph>pish-sh!</emph>" which came with indignant emphasis from the General, who had been hovering around the passage-way, and now pounced on my poor relation with the vindictive fury of a cormorant on its helpless prey.</p>
                  <p>"Ugh!" exclaimed the General in a deep bass voice, expressive of intense disgust. "<emph>Pretty Daisey, is it?</emph> An artful, cunning impostor, endeavoring to steal away the affections of a little girl whose future I am deeply interested in; for whose happiness I feel the tenderest solicitude. I will not stand by and patiently submit to this humbug's pretensions; my blood is fired, the spirit of the Bloxhams is aroused. I mean war—a fortune-hunter! <emph>Bah!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>The General, having uttered this threatening speech, finished off by greeting Jasper with a ferocious scowl, and walked away in a towering rage.</p>
                  <p>Daisey looked at Jasper and smiled mischievously. My poor relation laughed outright.</p>
                  <p>"I am a fortune-hunter, eh, my little Daisey; suppose I should ask Mr. Links to let me have you, what would <emph>he</emph> say?"</p>
                  <p>"I don't know, I am sure," replied Daisey, confusedly arranging her jockey on her pretty-shaped head. "Come, Mr. Tripp," she added, coquettishly, "you haven't told me how I look in this nice hat, isn't it gay? I want to look as fine as possible because I am about to pay a visit to my guardian."</p>
                  <p>Jasper pronounced the hat very becoming, and would have added more, but she hurried off with a rich color mantling her cheek, which told more eloquently than words a pleasant story to Jasper Tripp.</p>
                  <p>That evening C. Bloxham, Jr., came rushing in Tripp's chamber to convey the startling news that P. R. Jopps and his family had engaged board at the Bloxham house.</p>
                  <p>"Uncle Jopps!" ejaculated my poor relation.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, Tripp, its <emph>him</emph>, besides his wife and two stylish daughters. They must have come across my little advertisement in the <title>Herald</title>. 'Three pleasant front rooms to let, with first-class board, apply at Forty-three, Bloxham place,' and the result was they engaged the suite at once."</p>
                  <p>"I thought Uncle Jopps lost everything," observed Jasper reflectively.</p>
                  <p>"I guess," replied C. Bloxham, Jr., tapping the side of his nose significantly. "I guess P. R. Jopps kept a few eagles to feather his own nest. You may bet on him as a shrewd old sport; he pays me in advance—not in greenbacks, you know, but regular tinkling, bright gold pieces. Confound it," pursued the young gentleman, angrily, "I wish everybody would be just as accommodating in paying up. There's the Rockers, they have been here three years last May and not a precious red cent have I got from them all this while."</p>
                  <p>"What does the General say to that one-sided arrangement?" asked Jasper, smiling.</p>
                  <p>"Hold," rejoined C. Bloxham, Jr.; "you havn't got the gist of the thing. The Rockers go on security; they haven't the ready money, so they turn me off with a mortgage on a tract of land—title good, of course. Why, Tripp, you haven't any idea how some people exist in this city: they live on security altogether; think of a man staying five years with me, never paying a dollar of rent, yet keeping his head above water level the whole time. For instance, A gives me a mortgage deed on his land; when that is eaten up, A has a small farm in the country and that goes; then A gives me a deed for a lot in Hoboken; then A pawns all his diamonds and jewelry, and a splendid set they were. Then A turns over to me as a lien his paintings and gay piano, and finally the General, a sharp fellow, you know, comes down and gobbles up his baggage, which, after all, contained only a dozen shirts and some odd trifles. We lost about a week's board; but if it hadn't been for the beloved stepmother we might have been stuck for a much larger amount."</p>
                  <p>"What became of this unfortunate boarder?" inquired Jasper, thoughtfully.</p>
                  <p>"Became of him?" repeated C. Bloxham, Jr., scratching his head. "Why, as to that I can't tell. I suppose, like all beats, he went on the public. By the by, Tripp, father is down on you awful."</p>
                  <p>"He seems to be very much prejudiced against me," replied Jasper with an odd smile.</p>
                  <p>"Prejudice ain't the word," replied C. Bloxham, Jr. "The old gentleman has got<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC5830-00000038"/> it into his head you are very poor—he hates poor people. I believe he would lynch 'em if he had the power."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed!" rejoined Jasper, smiling good-naturedly.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, Tripp, that old man has an independence of mind, a strength of character, which would make him shine as a ruler; his motto is 'square payment, and <emph>then</emph> square treatment'—he does everything on the square, all but marrying the beloved stepmother; that was out of all proportion. If a man pays him up square, he's all right; if he owes him, he is a beat of the first water. How beautifully the world would go on, Tripp, if everybody had such square notions as my practical parent."</p>
                  <p>At this moment the dinner bell rang; C Bloxham, Jr., and my poor relation descended to the dining-room, the former pausing to judiciously lower the gas in each passage—an economical arrangement that cannot be too highly recommended to enterprising landlords, who may desire to revenge themselves on the gas monopolies.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">RELATING TO THE GENTEEL FAMILY OF P. R. JOPPS.</head>
                  <p>The descent from Fifth avenue to the plebeian quarters of 43 Bloxham place, was a sad downfall for P. R. Jopps.</p>
                  <p>The ex-broker, as an illustration of a very exalted mind in tribulation, was profoundly affected by the circumstance, and looked as gloomy as a deposed emperor, when his family removed from their splendid mansion to "the pleasant front rooms" of the celebrated boarding-house.</p>
                  <p>About 6 P. M., while dinner was progressing, two young ladies closely veiled, followed by a fleshy, complacent-featured matron, slipped in the Bloxham House, and crept up stairs with the stealth and secrecy of criminals.</p>
                  <p>It was the family of P. R. Jopps. Once alone, and safe from the prying, intrusive gaze of strangers, the two girls threw themselves on the sofa, and in a paroxysm of grief bewailed the change in their worldly prospects. They were twins, Bertha and Linda by name, with remarkable short noses, small eyes, and long curls; in manners, extremely childlike, derived from the force of their early education; Mrs. Jopps having taught them to view their life as a state of youthful probation, wherein they had successively passed through the intermediate stages of infancy at fifteen, childhood at twenty, and were just blooming into womanhood at twenty-five.</p>
                  <p>"Children," observed Mrs. Jopps, who felt it her duty to put in a word of consolation, "you must endeavor to bear your reverses with patience and fortitude—we might be more badly off."</p>
                  <p>"Can there be a worse place than this in the wide world?" sobbed Linda, spitefully.</p>
                  <p>"A great deal worse, my love," replied Mrs. Jopps. "What would you say if we had a rag carpet on the floor?"</p>
                  <p>"A rag carpet!" repeated Linda, opening her eyes.</p>
                  <p>"A rag carpet," pursued Mrs. Jopps, who was evidently recurring to some early reminiscence. "A pine table, tin plate, and german-silver spoons."</p>
                  <p>"Awful!" exclaimed Linda, with breathless horror. "Tin plates and german-silver spoons! Bertha, did you ever?"</p>
                  <p>"You havn't, either of you, any idea of poverty, I perceive," continued Mrs. Jopps, sighing. "Nor do I quite wonder at it; you were bred up in luxury and the expectation of a fortune, whereas I was raised in the country, and had no expectations, unless it was from an old maiden aunt, who willed her cottage and two acres to me, and has been living ever since in excellent health."</p>
                  <p>"We were born ladies, ma, and how can we be anything but ladies?" said Bertha.</p>
                  <p>"That is true, Bertha, as you live," rejoined Mrs. Jopps, "which your father should have remembered before he entered into these ruinous speculations. I advised him to purchase a farm and deed it over to me, and insure his life and use all necessary precautions, but he wouldn't take my advice, but kept on speculating until he speculated away our house and rosewood piano, and those little bronze images, which, you recollect, stood on the mantel-piece in the front parlor, and went off at a great sacrifice."</p>
                  <p>Here Mrs. Jopps broke down herself, and cried with the young ladies.</p>
                  <p>"Is this a house for poor people, ma?" asked Linda, heaving a deep sigh.</p>
                  <p>"Not exactly," replied Mrs. Jopps, wiping her eyes, "though I suppose there are a great many poor people living in it. It's what we Fifth avenue aristocrats call genteel poverty, because all live beyond their incomes, and some have no incomes at all. When we were over to Saratoga last year, you remember a red-complexioned gentleman who had a carbuncle, and a great many trunks, on his nose, which afterwards—I mean the trunks—turned out to be full of rocks, though the gentleman rode in a carriage and two horses, and drank Verzenay for his dinner, and invited Bertha to ride, which I am glad she didn't, seeing that he run off without paying his bills. That was a specimen of what we call genteel poverty, my dear."</p>
                  <p>"He was nothing but a humbug," said Bertha, indignantly.</p>
                  <p>"Bertha, my love, you will very much oblige me if you will avoid repeating such indelicate expressions. I have often told you that no one but persons of vulgar origin use them, though I <emph>did</emph> hear a minister call a bridegroom something of the kind once for giving him a check for two hundred dollars as a marriage fee, and which none of the banks would cash for the reason that he hadn't any deposit at all."</p>
                  <p>Here a gentle tap announced a visitor; Bertha hastily arranged the folds of her wrapper, and opened the door.</p>
                  <p>My poor relation stood at the entrance, and held out his hand.</p>
                  <p>"Cousin Bertha, do you remember Jasper?"</p>
                  <p>Cousin Bertha was quite surprised—perhaps unpleasantly so, as she surveyed the shabbily dressed figure before her; she had heard Jasper was in the city, but had not seen him since her <emph>infancy;</emph> they had been warm friends then, for Jasper was a law student, and had an income, and was reckoned a promising young man; but time makes old changes sometimes in the feelings and demeanor of most people.</p>
                  <p>Cousin Bertha coldly courtesied, and allowed him to enter.</p>
                  <p>"This is Jasper, sister," said Bertha, with a glance of intelligence towards Linda.</p>
                  <p>Linda bowed haughtily, and Mrs. Jopps bristled up into something like her former importance, as she said:</p>
                  <p>"Jasper, if it is you, though you have grown very thin and tall since I last saw you, I feel it my duty to mention that your uncle has expressly forbidden you to hold any social relations with your cousins whatever. I should mention also that your uncle has failed, but saved a little"—Mrs. Jopps coughed—"to keep up the dignity of the family; he has advised me to discourage any attempts to renew the acquaintance which I must own, in view of your being out of business, and having no means of support, is not very desirable. I don't object, however, to give you a little advice; if you are in search of employment you can find it, I am positive, by referring to the <title>Herald</title>, which has always a long column of "wants," in the morning edition, which nobody can possibly read, or the advertisements wouldn't be there so long; though I do remember of a young man who cut them all out and pasted them on his back—I mean the back of his memorandum-book—and nearly were himself to a skeleton, hunting up the places, though I am not sure he found a situation either."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Jopps, having finished this valuable piece of advice, drew a long breath and looked triumphant.</p>
                  <p>"And you, cousin Linda," said Jasper, turning to the young lady. "Will you, too, give the cold shoulder to one who in early years was your playmate and friend?"</p>
                  <p>Linda smiled and tossed her head affectedly.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Tripp will please remember I was a very young girl at the time—a mere child."</p>
                  <p>"You and your sister are not far from it now, Linda, my love," interrupted Mrs. Jopps, delighted at an opportunity to speak again. "Your cousin Jasper will easily recollect when he last saw you both, you wore lovely tarletan frocks very short, and purple kid slippers, and, as I remember, people were talking about the shortness of your dresses."</p>
                  <p>"Mother, pray don't bring up such absurd memories," spoke Bertha sharply.</p>
                  <p>"Cousin Bertha," said Jasper feelingly, "you then regarded me with the affection of a sister; do you, like the rest, cast me off?"</p>
                  <p>"I must say, Jasper, I do not feel quite so sentimental over our early days. I was then but a child, you know."</p>
                  <p>Jasper Tripp smiled contemptuously.</p>
                  <p>"And children still, if not in years at least in wisdom; good evening to you!" and my poor relation strode out with such an altered bearing and a dignified mien as almost petrified the female representatives of the house of Jopps.</p>
                  <p>At the threshold he met Mr. Jopps, who<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC5830-00000039"/> frowned slightly on recognizing my poor relation; then cautiously looking around to satisfy himself no one was within ear-shot, Mr. Jopps paused and said:</p>
                  <p>"I understand, Mr. Tripp, you are staying temporarily at this boarding-house. You will please bear in mind"—Mr. Jopps spoke very deliberately—"I do not now nor ever shall recognize you as a relative of mine. Do not mention me even as a distant connection. I hope I render my meaning sufficiently clear?"</p>
                  <p>"Perfectly so," returned my poor relation, whose calm expression of face did not alter in the least. "Anything further, Uncle Jopps?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, something further," added the ex-millionaire, flushing. "I do not wish you to show the slightest recognition to my daughters. You will meet them at meal hours, but always as strangers."</p>
                  <p>My poor relation waved his hand in silent acquiescence and walked away.</p>
                  <p>P. R. Jopps, after this sudden gust of family pride, retired serenely to his room, proudly conscious that he had preserved the dignity and honor of the house of Jopps untarnished, even in adversity.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
                  <head type="sub">IN WHICH DAISEY GOES INTO SOCIETY.</head>
                  <p>A new life had dawned upon Daisey; a life which seemed a fairy vision indeed, after her past, weary tread-mill existence; a life to her of sunshine and flowers, for when the heart is light and free from care, it is one perpetual summer all the year round.</p>
                  <p>At first our young heroine was bewildered with the attentions that poured in upon her from every quarter; ladies who had scarcely deigned to honor the factory girl with a glance, were now ready to shower the heiress with fulsome homage. The gentlemen basked in her smiles and were deferential in bouquets and sweeter compliments. Even the beloved step-mother had made the most gracious advances, and the General fairly overwhelmed her with officious politeness. But, odd and strange as this ovation might seem, her sensible little head was not turned by it in the least. It was so easy to please now, and Daisey's modest, gentle and dignified bearing made her immensely popular with everybody.</p>
                  <p>The General, like the fabled monster who guarded the Hesperian fruit, jealously kept his eye on the young heiress, and was ever on the alert to crush the hydra-headed attempts of young men aspiring to her hand, but Marl Roget had managed to deceive him. Marl was a handsome medical student, who had been boarding a few weeks only at the Bloxham house, and stood high in the confidence of the General.</p>
                  <p>Marl Roget had won golden opinions from every one by his genteel appearance and captivating address. Strangely blinded was the General not to perceive that Roget had begun to show marked attention to Daisey.</p>
                  <p>The artful Mr. Roget had blunted the keen judgment and clear perceptions of his eminent friend. This was partly attributable to flattery and euchre. Roget allowed himself to be euchred in cards, but in turn had playfully whitewashed his distinguished opponent in the quiet game of love.</p>
                  <p>When out of the way of the General, and in company with his more youthful associates, Marl Roget was another man. In euchre, whist, and all fours he was invariably the winner; his dexterity in "three card monte" conspicuously displayed his talents. Marl usually played this instructive little game with the nice young men boarders, which generally terminated in the nice young men "poneying up," a phrase that gentlemen of extravagant habits and limited means will readily comprehend in the course of their <choice>
                        <sic>wordly</sic>
                        <corr>worldly</corr>
                     </choice> experience.</p>
                  <p>Marl had such a cool, deliberate air about him, that no one wondered at the ease with which he descended from euchre to love matters.</p>
                  <p>How he became acquainted with Daisey was a mystery, puzzling to the inquisitive newsmongers and gossips; in some way Marl had obtained an introduction and was pushing the advantage vigorously.</p>
                  <p>Marl would converse with Daisey in that easy, deferential fashion so captivating to a girl of sense, and slyly edge in flattery in a skilful, indirect style when chance favored him, for a public parlor in a boarding-house offers but small opportunities to a quiet <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tete-a-tete</foreign>, when a head is popping in every moment, and a dozen intrusive eyes staring at you all the while.</p>
                  <p>The public parlor is, however, public property; so thought Mr. Sweedles, a young gentleman of musical tastes, who was perpetually drumming on the tuneless Chickering piano until Marl put a couple of books inside, which silenced the instrument for a time and drew upon the innocent Mr. Sweedles the wrath of the beloved stepmother; so thought Mr. Crandlebury, a superannuated merchant, who were a scratch and monopolized the fire-place in winter, and the sofa in summer, and was de pendent over the financial condition of the country. Such evidently was the opinion of Miss Silverwell, the book agent, a lively, chatty being, who hired the back room on the third floor without board, and eat one meal a day to save expense.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding these serious drawbacks Marl Roget found frequent opportunities of talking with the young heiress without being annoyed by the prying impertinence of the inquisitive.</p>
                  <p>On such occasions, Mr. Roget would relate interesting stories of his travels by land and sea—and Marl had been a great traveller—how he had been shipwrecked in the Bay of Biscay, famished on the Madagascar Islands, and nearly perished by the hot sirocco of the African desert.</p>
                  <p>Marl could talk fluently, and Daisey was interested in spite of herself, though there was something about the face of Roget that did not impress her favorably. It was a bold, handsome face, destitute of principle; yet few discovered it, either because they were careless or indifferent readers of character, or for the reason that the fascinating address of Mr. Roget had altogether bewitched them.</p>
                  <p>Since Daisey's introduction to the social coterie of the Bloxham house, the parlor had grown more popular as a fashionable rendezvous, particularly after dinner, where the ladies congregated in all the swelling grace of crinoline and discussed, as only <choice>
                        <sic>feminity</sic>
                        <corr>femininity</corr>
                     </choice> can discuss, the fashions, current news and gossip; but their conversation was now directed in a new and interesting channel, resulting from the startling events that had recently transpired—the sudden stroke of good fortune to Daisey, and the advent of the Jopps family,—two topics that fully employed the head gossips of Bloxham's celebrated boarding-house.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Moffins and Mrs. Skyler were the chief gossips, and drew their inspiration in part from the beloved step-mother, who was a kind of silent partner in a firm which had existed for some time under the popular name of "Moffins, Skyler &amp; Co."</p>
                  <p>The Moffins, who formerly ran a cake bakery in the Bowery and entertained strong prejudices against sheriffs' attachments, were loud in their expressions of disgust at the arrogant bearing off the Jopps.</p>
                  <p>"They are full of airs as they can stick," said Mrs. Moffins, meeting Mrs. Skyler in the parlor after dinner, by mutual appointment. "I don't want to know them, for I am sure I couldn't abide their grandness."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Skyler, who claimed to be distantly related to the English nobility, strongly dissented from the opinion expressed by her friend, Mrs. Moffins.</p>
                  <p>"They are nice people," observed Mrs. Skyler; "you must know them in order to appreciate their style; Mr. Jopps was a millionaire and was ruined by Black Friday."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed! did a negro man cause him to fail?" exclaimed Mrs. Moffins, staring very hard at Mrs. Skyler.</p>
                  <p>"No, no; speculation, my dear, was the cause. You see, Mrs. Moffins, they called the day Black Friday on account of the terrible evil doings, though I dare say there were a good many colored people who speculated and lost as well as Mr. Jopps."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Crandlebury, the superannuated merchant, who occupied his favorite seat on the sofa, here uttered a deep groan, whereat the two gossipping ladies started palpably and cried "oh!"</p>
                  <p>"It is terrible to consider what this nation is coming to," said Mr. Crandlebury, gloomily fixing his eyes on Mr. Sweedles, who had just taken his accustomed seat at the pianoforte. "The financial condition of the country is enough to make one's hair stand on end! We are drifting to general bankruptcy and ruin. What is the cause of it?" added Mr. Crandlebury, vehemently. "The bloated bond-holders; they are the curse of the country!"</p>
                  <p>Here Mr. Crandlebury shook his fist violently at Mr. Sweedles, and relapsed into imbecility.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Sweedles, refreshed undoubtedly by this statesmanlike view of the finances, commences to rattle over the keys of the resuscitated piano, giving his variations of "Home, sweet home," ending with the lively and popular air of "Little Jacky Ginger;" this performance executed with vigor arouses the dormant faculties of Mr. Sweedles, who immediately returns with fresh ardor to "Home, sweet home," glides from thence to "Little Jacky Ginger," and, as an example<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC5830-00000040"/> ample of rare perseverance, starts back to "Home, sweet home," in happy unconsciousness that Mr. Crandlebury has mysteriously disappeared and the ladies sitting like monumental figures, in that classic state of despair which is termed by the poets "melancholy resignation."</p>
                  <p>"What do you think of Miss Daisey Bright's beau?" asked Mrs. Skyler, resuming, when Mr. Sweedles had given them a brief respite.</p>
                  <p>"A perfect gentleman, handsome as an Apollo."</p>
                  <p>"I don't mean Mr. Roget," rejoined Mrs. Skyler, maliciously; "I refer to that inferior-looking fellow, <emph>you</emph> know."</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Are</emph> you sure?" inquired Mrs. Moffins, with an eager expression of delight on her gossipping face. "Do you really think so?"</p>
                  <p>"It's all on <emph>his</emph> side; she don't care a speck for him," whispered Mrs. Skyler. "Can you wonder at it? They say he is <emph>very</emph> poor."</p>
                  <p>"Oh," exclaimed Mrs. Moffins, "That is dreadful; I heard as much!"</p>
                  <p>"—sh!" said Mrs. Skyler, putting her finger on her lips significantly. "<emph>She's</emph> coming!"</p>
                  <p>Daisey, in company with a bevy of girls, now entered, looking as she always looked, smiling and happy; Miss Mellowflowers, the wine merchant's daughter, and Aurelia Beeswig, a boarding-school miss, had severally their arms round Daisey's waist, and were playfully denominated by her as her right and left bower, while other ladies, as a reserve corps, formed a devoted semicircle round the young heiress.</p>
                  <p>The entrance of the ladies inspired Mr. Sweedles to repeat "Home, sweet home," and "Jacky Ginger" again, a desire speedily checked by C. Bloxham, Jr., who thrust in his head, and mysteriously beckoned the musical young gentleman out of the room; a movement which correctly implied that Mr. Sweedles, to use a financial term, had been "cornered," and was extremely "short" in his board bill.</p>
                  <p>Miss Aurelia Beeswig, being near Daisey's age, had conceived a violent affection for the young lady, and was perpetually begging a kiss, smelling of her perfumed handkerchief, and making various demonstrations which argued a remarkable infatuation, considering Miss Aurelia had been acquainted with Daisey about a half an hour.</p>
                  <p>"Are you French?" asked Miss Aurelia, as they finally took a seat on the sofa.</p>
                  <p>"No, I am an American."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, I wish you <emph>was</emph> French; it's so nice to be French."</p>
                  <p>"I can't agree with you," replied Daisey, smiling. "I wouldn't be anything else but American for all the world. I am proud of my country."</p>
                  <p>"I do so love the French," rejoined Miss Aurelia. "I am learning French; I should be charmed to see Paris; it must be a real nice place; I should like first of all to visit the Jardin des Plantes."</p>
                  <p>"What place is that, pray?" asked Daisey, shaking her curls dubiously. "I am sure I never heard of it before."</p>
                  <p>"Why, the Botanical Garden to be sure," explained Aurelia, opening her brown eyes. "Don't you understand the French language?"</p>
                  <p>"Alas! no; I am a very ignoramus; didn't you know it?" answered Daisey, laughing.</p>
                  <p>"Well, you are pretty if you are not learned," said Aurelia, clasping her affectionately round the waist. "You've got such soft, black eyes; such a small nose, white teeth and beautiful curls."</p>
                  <p>"What nonsense," said Daisey, coloring. "You are the sweetest flatterer I ever met; you forget I am lame."</p>
                  <p>"I should never notice it, you use your crutches so nice; everybody is speaking of it in the house."</p>
                  <p>At this instant their conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Marl Roget, dressed in a genteel suit of black, and superlative white vest.</p>
                  <p>"There is a handsome young gentleman coming whom, I am sure, you will like much better than me," pursued Daisey, mischievously. "Shall I introduce you?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, <emph>not</emph> for the world!" returned Miss Aurelia, giggling. "Do you know our teacher forbids us, even at recess, to look at the men; we, girls, peep out of the blinds at them, though; oh, you mustn't introduce me on any account whatever."</p>
                  <p>Here Miss Aurelia broke into a fresh giggle, and playfully attacked Daisey with her fan and hid her blushing face in her lap, looking up just in time to courtesy bashfully as Daisey went through the ceremony of introduction.</p>
                  <p>"You appear to be enjoying yourselves young ladies," observed Marl Roget, smiling in his fascinating way. "I almost fear to interrupt your pleasant chat; but I have a particular reason for disturbing you. We are to have a fine singer at the Academy of Music to-night. May I hope"—Mr. Roget gave a deferential glance at Daisey—"May I hope to have the pleasure of your company," he added with a low bow, "and your friend also?"</p>
                  <p>Daisey had never been to a public entertainment in her life, and was pleased at the very novelty of the idea; but would it be proper in her to accept the invitation without consulting her guardian or asking the advice of her friend Jasper Tripp? "What would <emph>he</emph> think of it?" she murmured softly to herself.</p>
                  <p>In the midst of her perplexity and indecision, her eyes met Miss Beeswig's brown orbs. Aurelia's face plainly said, "I will go if you will."</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Shall</emph> we?" asked Daisey in a whisper to her companion.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I think it would be real nice," returned Miss Aurelia, giggling.</p>
                  <p>The two girls then, in an immense flutter of expectation, wrapped themselves up in shawls; Marl Roget promptly escorted them to a carriage, and they were driven to the Academy of Music.</p>
                  <p>There was a jam at the ticket office, though most of the seats had been disposed of beforehand, for a celebrated cantatrice, Madame Rosina Sangler, was to make her first bow to an American audience, she having been received by the English nobility with great eclat, a prestige sufficiently great to recommend her to the public everywhere else.</p>
                  <p>It was an imposing sight to Daisey to be ushered in a brilliantly illuminated hall, crammed to suffocation with an array of showy dresses and superlative broadcloth, while an army of fans were wafting around an incense of "night blooming Cereus," and diamonds and dark eyes vieing with each other as they flashed in the gas light.</p>
                  <p>From her seat in the parquette Daisey could view the hundreds of well-dressed ladies, who were ogling their neighbors with opera glasses, some displaying unconsciously, of course, a pretty hand, a dimpled wrist, or round, well-developed arm; while others as innocently struck bewitching attitudes, as though they expected to be photographed by some reportorial artist, and appear in the next morning's <title>Herald</title> as "the charming B., whose graceful and Hebe-like figure was delightfully conspicuous."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Roget, with the art of a social diplomat, had provided for the occasion only one opera-glass, and while Aurelia was staring through it, availed himself of the opportunity to dart the tenderest glances at our young heroine; he was provoked to perceive that Daisey did not indicate much interest for his exclusive society; her attention being mainly directed to things around her. In vain Mr. Roget ventured his softest blandishments and most honeyed flattery; he was secretly enraged at her indifference, for he had a small opinion of human nature, and woman's in particular.</p>
                  <p>But the concert was delightful; as the musical critic observed, Madame Rosina "went beyond herself,"—he having never heard her before—and was encored rapturously by the pleased audience. The fair singer extended her mouth, and used her lungs, as all ambitious artistes do who pant for celebrity; and the cords of her dainty, delicate neck swelled, as she pitched an "octave higher." Her listeners, unable longer to control themselves, burst into wild approval, and bouquets fell thick and fast, one of which swung by the excited hand of a young, musical enthusiast, hit her a vivid thump on her delicate nose; but when Madame Rosina, as a finale, sung the "Star Spangled Banner," the audience rose to their feet and greeted her with a perfect tornado of applause. The ladies wept and fluttered their wet handkerchiefs; the gentlemen swung their beavers and shouted frantically, while a bottle-nosed gentleman made himself noticeably conspicuous by yelling out "<emph>keno</emph>," at the top of his voice, until a policeman took the excited gentleman in custody.</p>
                  <p>In the midst of this wild enthusiasm, which exceeded any reception given to former artistes, Daisey preserved a decent composure, and wondered that Marl scarcely moved in his chair and looked on with a cold smile.</p>
                  <p>"You are not an enthusiast, Mr. Roget," she said, turning to him when the hubbub had ceased. "Do you not admire Madam Rosina's singing?"</p>
                  <p>"Very much," replied Marl, gallantly adjusting her shawl. "Although I hardly think my admiration would tempt me into such a foolish display."</p>
                  <p>"You do not understand the reason," said Daisey. "The New York people are<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC5830-00000041"/> the most patriotic in the world. It was the subject which created the excitement."</p>
                  <p>"I must confess," rejoined Mr. Roget, "I havn't much faith in the people's attachment for a government. Self interest is the order of the day, a fig for patriotism!"</p>
                  <p>As he said this, pleasantly smiling all the while, Marl stooped and picked up a piece of paper which lay at Daisey's feet. It had writing on it, and a curious expression passed across his features as he perused the pencil lines thereon. It was Jasper's promissory note.</p>
                  <p>"Here, Miss Daisey, I believe this is yours," he carelessly remarked, extending it.</p>
                  <p>Daisey, who kept the paper as a kind of souvenir, blushed a deep crimson, and almost snatched it from him.</p>
                  <p>Marl Roget smiled again, a smile pregnant with meaning; he had noticed the confusion and embarrassment of Daisey, and it disclosed to him an important secret; but he said nothing to furnish an index to his thoughts, silently offering his arms to each of the girls, and politely handed them in the carriage.</p>
                  <p>"Now, I propose an oyster supper," said Marl. "What do you say to it, young ladies?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, that will be nice—so nice," replied Miss Beeswig, gazing inquiringly at her companion.</p>
                  <p>"You will have to excuse us," returned Daisey, giving a reproving glance to Aurelia.</p>
                  <p>Marl looked disappointed, and ordered the coachman to drive home.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
                  <p>WHICH RELATES TO SOME FINANCIAL MATTERS OF P. R. JOPPS, THAT DID NOT APPEAR IN THE NEWSPAPERS.</p>
                  <p>P. R. Jopps as the deposed broker of Wall street, was not clearly Mr. Jopps, boarder at the Bloxham house. It is true some likeness existed to the ex-broker, in the neatly dressed gentleman who were black broadcloth, kids, and superlatively glossy boots. There might have been a resemblance traced in his pompous talk and dignified bearing; but P. R. Jopps, the formidable personage who radiated from the Gold-room to Fifth avenue with the prestige of wealth, who excluded visitors from his office by autocrat notices posted up in the antechamber, who bluffed the "bulls" and bullied the "bears," had disappeared forever amidst the terrible storm of Black Friday, while Jopps, as an individual, Jopps, as a common-place realization of a person who may live or die and remain equally unknown, was still breathing the breath of animated existence.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Jopps had the melancholy pleasure of reading his own social obituary, attending his social funeral, and listening to the criticisms of brother brokers, who could now afford to praise him,—a species of posthumous justice a man is sure to get after he is dead.</p>
                  <p>Yet it was a consolation that in the contracted circle in which he moved, Mr. Jopps had still preserved his dignity unimpaired, and nurtured his pride as a relic of former greatness.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Jopps, therefore, as an individual, relaxed none of his austerity to my poor relation. He levelled his eyeglass superciliously towards him at the dinner table, frowned on him in the street, and patronizingly alluded to him as a young man who had applied for assistance and whom he declined to serve for the reason that he was unworthy of his or any other person's charity. Mr. Jopps usually pronounced this last word with much unction, thereby insinuating that if any help had been extended, it would have been "charity, sir,—nothing more."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Jopps, as an individual, was highly displeased to learn that my poor relation had actually obtained something to do without his patronage or assistance.</p>
                  <p>"If anybody wishes to learn what I know of that fellow," said Mr. Jopps, as he sat alone in his private parlor at the Bloxham house—"at least, should any one solicit me for a certificate of his character, I should conceive it my duty to say, 'I know nothing about him, nothing whatever!' It is a duty I owe to society and I mean to fulfil it."</p>
                  <p>Having given vent to this lofty observation which was addressed to no one in particular, the individual looked at his watch and found it was past midnight. The utmost quietness reigned throughout the house; no one, apparently, was stirring. It was probably this circumstance that caused a satisfied expression to flit over the face of the wakeful Mr. Jopps, as he rose from his chair and drew from the closet a small iron box. As a prelude to opening it, Mr. Jopps stepped softly towards the door of the two sleeping apartments, where his family lay, and assured himself by a careful inspection that they were fast asleep; then the individual tried the fastenings of his door, peeped through the key-hole, and, as an additional precaution, stuffed a paper therein. These mysterious movements being completed, Mr. Jopps returned to the iron box, unlocked it and drew from thence the bag of gold which had been presented to him by his friend, J. Mallow.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Jopps took up the gold eagles, felt of them, and lovingly chinked them together. It was a strange sight to see this man, who a month back owned his millions, gloating over the possession of a few thousand gold pieces.</p>
                  <p>"Who is J. Mallow?" soliloquized Mr. Jopps, musingly, "is a question which I have not yet succeeded in satisfactorily answering; as to his motives, I am equally in the dark. He may be either an old friend, whom I conferred some benefit upon in earlier years, or he is possibly a madman; but, mad or sane, he has given this to me and I mean to keep it. I can lend it on interest with good security, and it will return to me again. The Jewish money lenders carry out this principle, and who ever heard of a poor Jew?—that is," added Mr. Jopps, "I never did."</p>
                  <p>Alluding to Mr. Jopps merely as an individual, I should observe that he retained some of the peculiarities of P. R. Jopps, socially deceased. As the absorbing passion of the broker was the acquisition of wealth, so the shadow degenerated into a miser and with trembling hands counted over his gold eagles,—a habit which nightly, at a certain hour, the individual went through with systematic precision. Having amused himself for a while with this pleasing avocation, he returned the money to its repository, and stowed it back in the closet.</p>
                  <p>The moon shone bright, so Mr. Jopps dispensed with the gas, and commenced to make preparations for retiring; he had taken off his cravat as a preliminary movement, when he was startled by a loud scream from his daughters' apartment, which connected with his own chamber.</p>
                  <p>"What <emph>is</emph> the matter?" he ejaculated simultaneously with Mrs. Jopps, as they both rushed into their bedroom.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, ma! oh, pa!" cried the two girls, with faces of ashy paleness. "There is a man in here!"</p>
                  <p>"A man!" echoed the horrified parent.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Jopps, who was decked in a long night gown, which gave her the appearance of a robed Millerite, uttered a shriek and clung to her husband.</p>
                  <p>"Where!" exclaimed Mr. Jopps, shaking off the good lady, and making a rush for his pistol case. "Tell me where?"</p>
                  <p>But the terror-stricken young ladies could only point to the door and full immediately into hysterics.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Jopps clutched his revolver and in a loud voice invited the bold interloper to come forth. This challenge eliciting no response, the ex-broker cautiously commenced to search for the hidden fee, hunted through wardrobe and closet, skirmished under the bed, and peered into every possible and impossible recess, without avail.</p>
                  <p>"You must have been dreaming, girls," said the perplexed Mr. Jopps.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, no!" cried the two young ladies in a breath.</p>
                  <p>"Imagination then," suggested Mr. Jopps.</p>
                  <p>"No, it was reality," spoke Linda, excitedly. "I was wide awake, the moon shines so bright I easily saw him—a tall, dark-haired man; he entered so softly that the door didn't even creak on its hinges; his face was covered with a horrid black mask."</p>
                  <p>"Linda's scream awoke me," added Bertha, "and I just caught sight of him as he disappeared."</p>
                  <p>"The door is locked," observed Mr. Jopps, examining it. "Why, girls, it is plainly evident you have been dreaming."</p>
                  <p>Bertha and Linda thereupon with uplifted hands declared most solemnly and emphatically they <emph>had</emph> seen a man. They could swear to it.</p>
                  <p>"May be it was a ghost," said Mrs. Jopps, opening her eyes wider. "You remember, girls, the wonderful story your aunt Jane used to tell of the ghost who appeared to her exactly at midnight, with a taper in his hands and a rope round his neck and never spoke a word, though your aunt had the courage to ask him his name. It turned out a young man had hung himself in that very room, on account of his girl eloping with a French pastry cook."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, ma," cried Linda, shivering. This wasn't a ghost I am sure, he had on stockings and his boots were off, because—"</p>
                  <p>"Linda, my love, I'm astonished at you," interrupted Mrs. Jopps, severely. "Of course ghosts are not supposed to wear<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC5830-00000042"/> stockings or even boots, though you will remember there have been cases on record where ghosts have appeared not only with stockings but boots and spurs. I recollect of reading somewhere in the newspapers of a ghost who used to haunt a lodging-house and disturb everybody, each night, with his heavy tread, and who finally was discovered to be no ghost at all, but an astronomer who looked through a long telescope at the stars, and predicted a great many things that never happened."</p>
                  <p>As there seemed every reason to believe that Mrs. Jopps would prolong the discussion on ghosts until morning, Mr. Jopps resignedly retired to his chamber and soon fell asleep.</p>
                  <p>He awoke late in the morning, feeling <unclear>dizzy</unclear> and weak with a sharp pain racking his head; he staggered into his daughters' chamber and was alarmed to find them all in a strange, unnatural slumber, breathing heavily. A strong smell of other pervaded the rooms, and Mr. Jopps, recalling the occurrence of the previous night, began to realize his family and himself had been drugged. With a thrill of consternation he rushed to his closet, dragged out the box and opened it in a twinkling.</p>
                  <p>It may be added that when Mr. Jopps had glanced inside, he fell flat on his face with a groan of abject misery.</p>
                  <p>The eagles had vanished and in their place was a heap of rubbish.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
                  <head type="sub">IN WHICH DAISEY HEARS VERY DISAGREEABLE NEWS.</head>
                  <p>Daisey did not fancy Marl Roget, and it required little penetration in the fortune-hunter to perceive that the road to her favor was beset with insurmountable obstacles. Marl, therefore, began to look around for stones (metaphorical ones) to throw at Daisey, and his recent discovery developed an idea which had been hatching in his cunning brain. When Daisey snatched Jasper's souvenir from him, she had unconsciously revealed a secret to the artful Mr. Roget, which she imagined was hid forever in her own bosom.</p>
                  <p>The following evening, Marl found her in the parlor, in company with Aurelia Beeswig, whose arm was clasped lovingly round the waist of her quondam friend.</p>
                  <p>The two girls were turning over the leaves of a large-sized album, while Aurelia, with much animation, was designating the names of each individual photographed therein; indeed, the easy manner in which the young lady went through the endless catalogue of family connections, indicated a thorough and comprehensive knowledge of the great Beeswig genealogical tree.</p>
                  <p>"That one," remarked Aurelia, pointing to the likeness of a severe-faced matron, sitting squarely in high-backed arm-chair. "That one is Aunt Polly; this here is Cousin Cornele; that is Grandma; that is Uncle Hopper and Aunt Hopper; this is, let me see, a great General in the Union Army, he ain't a relative though; and here's a picture of somebody else, whose name I can't remember. <emph>Oh!</emph> Mr. Roget, how you scared me!"</p>
                  <p>This last observation prefaced by a giggle and a blush, being intended for Marl, that gentleman came forward with a smile and a low bow, and sat himself by the side of the young girl, pretending to be greatly interested in the indifferent-looking photographs spread before him.</p>
                  <p>"Why don't <emph>you</emph> have an album, Daisey?" asked Aurelia, after they had waited in vain for Mr. Roget to speak.</p>
                  <p>"Me," laughed Daisey; "what would poor me do with an album? I haven't a relative or scarcely a friend in this wide world."</p>
                  <p>"You ought to get one," rejoined Aurelia. "It's real nice to keep an album. If you haven't cartes de visite enough to fill out, you can buy up all the great characters you know and put <emph>them</emph> in. They look so nice in—"</p>
                  <p>Here Aurelia's mother called the young lady temporarily out of the room; Marl seized the opportunity to give Daisey a home thrust.</p>
                  <p>"Miss Daisey," said he, carelessly toying with his watch-chain, "have you heard the news?"</p>
                  <p>"About what?" asked Daisey, scarcely raising her eyes from the album.</p>
                  <p>"A friend of yours," replied Marl, maliciously. "You may know it as well as the rest of us; he is paying attention, so it is reported, to a young lady recently arrived. Report must sometimes have a foundation, when, for instance, a poor man like <emph>him</emph> takes a fancy to a poor girl, we may, of course, suppose it means love, if nothing more; and if the girl reciprocally loves him, it is easy to see that the father may be duped; at least," added Marl, "that's the romantic way they have of doing it.</p>
                  <p>"I am sure I can't understand your drift," said Daisey, coloring in spite of herself.</p>
                  <p>"Let us suppose," continued Marl, with a crafty smile, "that the father don't know anything about the proposed match—he is a stubborn man, with no money and plenty of pride; but women have a happy faculty of deceiving their husbands or parents equally as well; they may elope or marry clandestinely; now what is the inference? why, you can answer that question yourself."</p>
                  <p>"You speak to me in enigmas," said Daisey, showing by her flashing eye and heaving bosom that the bait had taken. "Will you be more explicit, Mr. Roget?"</p>
                  <p>"I might make myself better understood," said Marl, "but I hate gossiping—I hate tittle-tattle. I should like to force Moffins, Skyler &amp; Co. to eat all the falsehoods they have originated in this house."</p>
                  <p>By this time Aurelia had returned, and the conversation dropped back to ordinary topics. Marl was chatty and agreeable, but failed to interest Daisey, who sat abstractedly looking over the "cartes de visite," scarcely observing that Marl, tired of the unequal contest, was directing his batteries at the more vulnerable boarding-school miss. Aurelia, delighted with his attentions, gradually relaxed her devotion to Daisey and transferred it to Mr. Roget.</p>
                  <p>The appearance of Mr. Sweedles, ornamented with a flashy red neck-tie, and in a great flow of animal spirits, consequent upon effecting a compromise with the "Corner," is the signal for Daisey to rise and leave her friends to enjoy their flirtation.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Sweedles, belonging to that class of self-satisfied mortals who live in a peculiarly inflated world of their own, is extremely oblivious of the presence of Marl and Aurelia, going through his favorite pieces, and immediately repeating them with a thumping motion of his foot on the pedal as an exhilarating variation.</p>
                  <p>Marl yawns and makes a grimace to Aurelia, who giggles and plays with her fan, then Marl whispers:</p>
                  <p>"Would you like to attend the theatre tonight?"</p>
                  <p>"I should, first rate," replied Aurelia. "But ma' might object to have me go alone, <emph>that is</emph>, with you."</p>
                  <p>"Oh," rejoined Marl, smiling in his fascinating way, "I love you better than a thousand mothers."</p>
                  <p>"You don't," cried Aurelia, blushing and playfully striking him with her fan. "You are making fun of me—he, he, he!"</p>
                  <p>"No, I ain't," rejoined Mr. Roget, affecting to be much hurt by the observation; "your mother may love you too, but not like me; come, I'll make a bet of a hundred dollars to five that you won't be afraid, just for a gay time, to slip off with me to the theatre without letting your ma' know anything about it."</p>
                  <p>Aurelia giggled and looked irresolute.</p>
                  <p>"I'll throw in a further bet with the odds in your favor," pursued the crafty Marl, "that you are a girl of pluck, and when you make up your mind, it's made past all peradventure; come, will you go?"</p>
                  <p>Aurelia looked in his handsome, bold face, and whispered:</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I am willing if—if you think we can return before ma' knows it."</p>
                  <p>"We'll manage that," replied Marl, carelessly. "Now get your cloak and hat, Miss Aurelia; <emph>confound that fellow</emph>, how he pounds on that piano. He'll be pitched out of the window one of these days, or ours is a desperate case, indeed!"</p>
                  <p>Daisey retired to the privacy of her own chamber, more disturbed than she was willing to allow, by the artful hints and innuendoes of Marl Roget. Of course, he <emph>had</emph> referred to Jasper. It was a strange story—Jasper engaged, Jasper in love with a girl as poor as himself? How could she believe it? At any other time Daisey would have rejected it as improbable and impossible, but then, Jasper had lately grown very reserved, and with pain she perceived he had studiously avoided her. So the weak invention of Marl Roget partially succeeded. Daisey was clearly unhappy, for in her heart she knew she loved Jasper dearly. The result was, she rose late the next morning with a headache and met Jasper with an averted face, a retaliatory measure which puzzled and surprised him.</p>
                  <p>Daisey had scarcely risen from the breakfast table ere a note came from her guardian, requesting her to come immediately over to his office. It was worded less ceremoniously than usual—almost peremptorily, she thought. Wondering within herself, at such an early summons, Daisey put on her cloak and hat, and cheerily wended her way to Park row.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Links' office was soon reached; her<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC5830-00000043"/> guardian was pacing the floor with a disturbed air. Daisey glanced at his solemn face, and the sunshine faded from her own in a moment.</p>
                  <p>"Miss Daisey," he said gravely, putting her in a chair and taking one himself; "I have bad news for you; you must prepare yourself for it."</p>
                  <p>"Bad news?" echoed Daisey in a faint tone; the color forsook her cheeks, a presentiment of evil came oppressively upon her like a nightmare, as she gave him an eager, searching glance.</p>
                  <p>"It is a painful duty, the saddest I have ever been called upon to perform," said Mr. Links. "I should have told it to you yesterday, but I could scarcely make up my mind."</p>
                  <p>"Do not keep me in suspense," murmured Daisey faintly; "if it is bad news let me hear it at once."</p>
                  <p>"Miss Daisey, pursued the lawyer, "a month ago I supposed you an heiress to half a million. I made a terrible mistake, a blunder which must result in a cruel disappointment to your hopes"</p>
                  <p>And then Mr. Links went on to relate how a strange old man had called on him a month before and instructed the lawyer to find Daisey Bright and notify her she had fallen heir to an immense estate. How the old man claimed to be a near relative, but for some mysterious reason declined to make himself known. How in part fulfilment of this intention he had turned over to Mr. Links, for Daisey's benefit, the sum of one thousand dollars, half of which was to be given her as her first monthly instalment, and the remainder for clothing and incidental expenses. How he had neglected to appear and ratify the legal arrangements, and how, finally news came that the old man had suddenly died, leaving literally nothing else but the sum he had so whimsically bequeathed to her.</p>
                  <p>And this was the property which had been left to poor little Daisey! The splendid fortune she had calculated as a certainty. The wealth which had transformed the tyrannical General and beloved step-mother into subservient, cringing parasites; that had swept away the traces of former indigence, and lifted her in the sunshine of prosperity.</p>
                  <p>And now as she was growing accustomed to the adulation and homage of those around her, basking in the prestige of affluence; just as she felt the new-born life dawning upon her with the glorious hopes youth pictures, it was a terrible thing to find the cup snatched from her lips, and her brilliant anticipations crushed at one fell blow.</p>
                  <p>Daisey sat in her chair, pale and motionless. She essayed to speak, but her voice died away in inarticulate murmurs.</p>
                  <p>"Compose yourself, my poor child," said Mr. Links, combing his hair with his long fingers until it stood up like porcupines' quills. "I am sorry for you, but you see there is no remedy."</p>
                  <p>"Why was I not told of this before?" exclaimed Daisey, recovering from her stupor and starting to her feet with passionate earnestness. "Why have I been allowed to go on day after day dreaming I was rich; deluded with false hopes, cheated by this bitter mockery! Far better would it have been for me to remain as I was, the humble dependent, the poor drudge, than to be lifted in this artificial existence only to be cast out to meet the sneers and derision of the unfeeling world. Far better had it been for me and for my future happiness, if you had never come to fill my ear with foolish stories of property for Daisey; what right had poor Daisey to expect anything else save poverty and obscurity? Oh! who has done me this cruel wrong?"</p>
                  <p>"Blame me," replied Mr. Links, impetuously thumping his breast. "Blame me for a stupid fool, a dolt, a numskull, to be humbugged by that pretentious impostor."</p>
                  <p>Daisey did not reply. She sank back into her chair, and gave way to a burst of grief.</p>
                  <p>"Poor child, I am sorry for you, very sorry indeed, but it can't be helped," said Mr. Links, walking the room with long, hasty strides. "Blame mo, Miss Daisey, for everything."</p>
                  <p>"No, no, I do not blame you, nor yet <emph>him,</emph>" answered Daisey, more softly. "His motives were good, and I should be grateful even for what he has done. Mr. Links, forgive me for my harshness; I am nervous and excited."</p>
                  <p>"I understand your feelings exactly," rejoined Mr. Links. "It is perfectly natural and excusable under the circumstances; but now compose yourself and come to business; you must make the best of your legacy. How much is left of the five hundred instalment?"</p>
                  <p>"Not one red cent."</p>
                  <p>"My dear young lady," ejaculated the astonished lawyer. "What, five hundred dollars expended in less than a month!"</p>
                  <p>"Every farthing of it," replied Daisey, smiling through her tears "You may well be surprised at my extravagance. First of all I have paid the board of a friend of mine, without his knowledge, the sum of fifty dollars; then I gave away to the factory girls at my old establishment, two hundred dollars more; thirdly, I subscribed one hundred dollars to the Orphan Asylum, and the remainder has gone for my own board and lodgings."</p>
                  <p>"Good heavens!" exclaimed Mr. Links aghast. "Did I ever hear of such an unselfish use of money? Why, my charitable young friend, you have beggared yourself by your munificence!"</p>
                  <p>"I know it," said Daisey calmly. "I regret it least of all. I have health and strength and can work again; besides, you forget my wardrobe; it is altogether too fine for my present condition; then there is my bracelets, my diamond ring and eardrops, they will sell for something."</p>
                  <p>"You had better retain them, for I think I can obtain employment for you. Can you write a fair hand?"</p>
                  <p>"My penmanship is rather stiff, for I have had small practice," replied Daisey, "though I have some knowledge of figures."</p>
                  <p>"I have been considering, as a small return for my past blunder, how I could serve you," said Mr. Links reflectively. "I am pretty sure I can get you a position as clerk or book-keeper at a comfortable salary. Now dry your eyes, my young friend, and hope for the best."</p>
                  <p>Daisey thanked the kind-hearted lawyer, and gratefully took her leave, promising to call again the next day. She was glad to get in the street, for her brain whirled and her head spun like a top.</p>
                  <p>"What ails my pretty Daisey?" said Jasper smilingly, stopping her as she reached the threshold of the Bloxham house, and attempted to glide unceremoniously by him.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Tripp, please allow me to pass," rejoined Daisey, with quiet dignity.</p>
                  <p>"Not until you explain why you treat your friend so coldly," replied Jasper, detaining her. "I am afraid prosperity is spoiling you. Do you wish to cast me off?"</p>
                  <p>He asked this question severely, looking in her dark eye with an earnest, sad expression, as though his old distrust of human nature was getting the better of him.</p>
                  <p>As Daisey returned his gaze, a deep blush crimsoned her cheek.</p>
                  <p>"Cast you off, Jasper? alas! <emph>you</emph> are the one who seek to forget the friendship of the past; God knows I am in especial need of a friend now."</p>
                  <p>She could not say more; tears blinded her, and choked her utterance</p>
                  <p>A look of tenderness came across Jasper's serene face. He clasped her round the waist and quietly drew her inside the parlor.</p>
                  <p>"Daisey, some one has been filling your little head with foolish stories of me. That some one told you a falsehood when he hinted my engagement with a young lady, meaning of course my cousin Linda, whom I did love once when I thought she had a heart. Now I am poor, Daisey, she shrinks from me, and deems me not worth a passing nod. Have you not long ago found out where Jasper's affections are? Are you ignorant that his love is stronger than the selfish passion which links men and women together so long as self-interest bids them love? You are rich, I am poor; do you trust me?"</p>
                  <p>She gave him one swift glance of tenderness and love, and turned away her face.</p>
                  <p>"Jasper, Jasper, you little dream how cruel fate denies me the power to reprove you for doubting that trust. I fear when you learn the truth you will hate me for wearing the plumage that does not belong to me."</p>
                  <p>"What has happened, my darling?"</p>
                  <p>"Daisey is not, as you suppose, wealthy—Daisey is a beggar."</p>
                  <p>She expected he would look disappointed when she told him all, but he listened calmly, with a quiet smile, and only drew her closer to his bosom.</p>
                  <p>"Dear Daisey, so much the better. I can ask you with more freedom to be Jasper's wife, to share the trials of his obscure destiny."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">IN WHICH THE GENERAL STARTS ON THE WAR PATH AND MEETS WITH A DISASTROUS DEFEAT.</head>
                  <p>The robbery of Mr. Jopps' gold eagles, according to the General's theory, was evidently the work of some party who resided in the house. It had been so cunningly<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC5830-00000044"/> ningly planned and deliberately executed that, beyond a few burglars' tools left behind, no traces existed to fasten the remotest suspicion on any one.</p>
                  <p>The reputation of the Bloxham house was in danger. The General as a self-appointed detective resolved to unearth the daring thief and bring him speedily to justice; his keen perceptive faculties had already put him on a trail, which he believed correct.</p>
                  <p>"Suspicious characters are always poor," argued the General. "Jasper Tripp is poor; therefore Jasper Tripp is a suspicious character."</p>
                  <p>This brilliant syllogism formed his only encouragement in working up the case. He watched Jasper constantly, dogged him systematically, for a time without avail; but at last the patience and zeal of the General was rewarded; a fresh discovery had been made which sent him big with importance to the Police Head-Quarters, and Mr. Jopps was confidentially informed that the thief would be soon apprehended.</p>
                  <p>The hour of victory should be with conquerors the moment of magnanimity, but the flushed General with erect head and stately tread returned home eager to sacrifice his victim on the altar of his vengeance.</p>
                  <p>He marched sedately in the house, and made his way to the sanctum of the beloved stepmother, who was in close confab with Mrs. Skyler. The last mentioned lady's husband being a bankrupt and a dependent on his father-in-law, who drove a brisk business in the fish market, the General looked very forbidding on entering, and uttered an ominous grunt of dissatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, here is the dear General," exclaimed the toad-eating Mrs. Skyler. "How surprised he will be to hear the news."</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Dear General</emph>," repeated the great man contemptuously. "What does the woman mean? Pish-sh!"</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Skyler looked humble and crest-fallen, while politic Madam Bloxham hastened to the relief of her crony, by recapitulating the news of Daisey's sudden downfall.</p>
                  <p>The General listened to the startling recital with a face of holy indignation.</p>
                  <p>"To think," he mournfully observed, "of the dainties I have lavished on that girl; the delicate pieces of steak and chicken carved for her; the first class attention she has received from the servants and the luncheons of cake and tea carried to her room. It cuts me to the soul to consider I have been bestowing my favors upon a thankless ingrate; but that is the way—it is human gratitude!"</p>
                  <p>"So it is," put in Mrs. Skyler, soothingly.</p>
                  <p>"It is human gratitude," pursued the General, casting a withering glance at Mrs. Skyler. "What have I not done for that girl? I picked her from the gutters, fed and clothed her; educated her at the free school, and how does she return my charity? By deceiving me; by fraudulently representing herself as a woman of property, by raising the hopes and expectations of her friends—by engaging board at an extravagant price."</p>
                  <p>The General's feelings overcame him; he pulled out his bandanna and wiped his glowing countenance with the air of a man who is conscious of having been imposed upon, but manfully resolved never to be swindled again.</p>
                  <p>"Astonishing things happen nowadays," observed Mrs. Skyler, deferentially.</p>
                  <p>"Astonishing things do happen, ma'am," repeated the General with much dignity—"are happening and will continue to happen."</p>
                  <p>As Mrs. Skyler did not venture to controvert this proposition, the General proceeded:</p>
                  <p>"And I may add the prediction that an astonishing circumstance will occur this evening, though it will not surprise me in the least; an impudent charlatan, who has been subsisting on the bounty of my son, will be exposed. Truth will be vindicated and justice triumph!"</p>
                  <p>With this eloquent outburst the General stalked majestically into the dining-room to superintend the preparation for dinner.</p>
                  <p>The "ordinary" went through a daily inspection; a few minutes before the gong sounded the vigilant General was sure to be on hand to review the army of starched napkins, whose weather-beaten appearance eloquently spoke of days gone by when they loomed up in cut-glass goblets at the New York Hotel and Delmonico's. Some of these veterans punctured with time-honored holes, and stained with iron rust, were especially reserved for what the beloved stepmother termed the "supernumeries."</p>
                  <p>The General with military precision marched and countermarched by the ghostly relies of departed gentility; pausing occasionally to transfer the more ragged ones to the plates of Mr. Sweedles and my poor relation; the former gentleman being "a short" was of course a constant sufferer from the exactions of the "Corner."</p>
                  <p>And now the gong sounds and the boarders come sweeping into the pent up dining-room, where General Bloxham stands at his accustomed post busily carving roast beef.</p>
                  <p>There was no fuming or fussing in the movements of that distinguished personage. His carving was the embodiment of physical dexterity and manly grace; tough or obdurate as the meat might be, the skill and experience of the General triumphed over all obstacles; one clear, incisive stroke of the well-sharpened blade displayed his masterly genius.</p>
                  <p>At these interesting moments the General developed the true dignity of his character: his face grew ruddier than the rarest parts of the beef, his eyes shone far brighter than the china plates, his ponderous arm, weighty with muscular firmness, dispensed slices of every geometrical form and shape around the dish, until the beholder was lost in admiration at the variety and extent of his manipulations.</p>
                  <p>It will be admitted by the impartial historian that on the present occasion the General manifested a slight excitement, arising from the momentous events already chronicled, which caused him to carve with uncommon awkwardness; but the work is accomplished, and like a gladiator who has conquered his foe, or a surgeon who has completed his dissection, he laid aside his weapon of attack, and complacently stood with folded arms watching the boarders as they gradually dropped in and filled their allotted seats.</p>
                  <p>At Madam Bloxham's table was Mrs. Skyler, Mrs. Moffins, and the Rocker family, who were eating up their estate with uncommon rapidity. Next to them, a gloomy frown on his brow, sat Mr. Crandlebury, whose despondency arising from the wrongs his country had sustained from "the bloated bondholders" had seriously impaired his constitution.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Sweedles in all the glory of a red neck-tie and well pomaded hair occupied a more obscure seat, while Jasper Tripp in his thread-bare coat and neat shirt collar came next, his thoughtful eyes directed on his plate.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Beeswig was talking French with Professor Tulle, who advertises to teach the French language, piano, banjo, and guitar, all in twenty-four lessons, at the amazingly low figure of fifty cents per lesson.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Mellowflowers and daughter—the wine merchant's family—occupied the more reserved and aristocratic portions of the table, sipping claret and occasionally giving a patronizing glance at Mr. Jopps and his daughters, who sat stiff and rigid as lay figures, while the individual looked dignified and grandly miserable.</p>
                  <p>The waiter girls hurry round in perspiring anxiety, dispensing soup, fish, flesh, and fowl to the patient boarders, each waiting their turn according to rank or precedence.</p>
                  <p>And now there is a flutter among the gossips; every eye is turned towards the door as Daisey enters; her figure, looking superb in a fawn-colored silk, her favorite dress in her palmy hours of exaltation, but now only a cruel reminder of her faded hopes and fallen fortunes.</p>
                  <p>Bad news travel fast; everybody had heard of Daisey's misfortune, and stare in surprise to observe no alteration in her demeanor, the same sweet smile plays over her face, serene and cloudless as a summer's sky. Madam Bloxham, beholding it, is vexed, while the General can scarcely repress his virtuous indignation. The friends of yesterday nod indifferently or affect not to see her, others bow patronizingly with a kind of condescension that seemed to imply, "you see I am too high-minded to show any difference, but you will please remember there is a gulf between us." Daisey's eye wandered from these summer friends to meet Jasper's glance of tenderness and love. It was a consolation to know one friend still remained, a friend whom she could not doubt or mistrust.</p>
                  <p>While Daisey was waiting to be served, conscious that the servants, taking the cue from the boarders, were already showing their insolence, a ring at the door-bell—a strong, business-like pull—created a stir round the table. The General laid down his knife and fork, and pompously marched from the room, a movement which caused a flutter of expectation amongst the gossips.</p>
                  <p>A brief whispered consultation ensued outside, and the General immediately reentered, followed by an officer of the Metropolitan Police.</p>
                  <p>"There is your man," said the General, pointing to Jasper.</p>
                  <p>The eyes of the boarders were fixed on the policeman, who walked deliberately up to my poor relation and laid his heavy hand on his shoulder.</p>
                  <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC5830-00000045"/>
                  <p>"I want you," spoke the officer, sternly. As Jasper rose with a look of surprise, the man immediately handcuffed him. At this the ladies shrieked and Daisey turned pale.</p>
                  <p>"What means this outrage?" asked Jasper, calmly.</p>
                  <p>"You will find out in time," rejoined the policeman, rudely collaring him; "I know you, you are an old offender." Haven't I got your pictur' in the Rogues' Gallery? Come on, you thieving old cormorant?"</p>
                  <p>Jasper's eye flashed and his cheek reddened at this insolent speech, but he was powerless to resist; the officer was about to drag him out when C. Bloxham, Jr., rushed suddenly into the room, his face half shaven and his hair in wild disorder.</p>
                  <p>"Halloo! what's the matter?" exclaimed the young gentleman, in much amazement.</p>
                  <p>"I am arrested, as you see," said Jasper, quietly.</p>
                  <p>"Arrested for what?"</p>
                  <p>"For burglary!" roared the General, whose indignation could no longer be restrained. "For entering with skeleton keys the chamber of Mr. Jopps and carrying away therefrom money to a large amount."</p>
                  <p>"Be calm, father, don't excite yourself," said C. Bloxham, Jr.; "hold on, officer, there is some mistake; in the first place who accuses Tripp?"</p>
                  <p>"I do," replied Madam Bloxham, maliciously.</p>
                  <p>"I do, most emphatically," added the General, puffing and blowing like a steam engine.</p>
                  <p>"I do," spoke Mr. Jopps, with melancholy resignation. "Facts altogether indisputable and conclusive compel me to admit his guilt."</p>
                  <p>C. Bloxham, Jr., looked perplexed, and his concern increased when the General produced Jasper's valise, and opening it, showed to the eyes of the wondering company two shining gold eagles.</p>
                  <p>"Those belong to Mr. Jopps," said the General, impressively, "and I will add, they have been identified by that gentleman as his property."</p>
                  <p>"I have identified them," replied Mr. Jopps solemnly, "as belonging to me."</p>
                  <p>"What does that prove?" inquired the General, in ill concealed exultation.</p>
                  <p>"It proves nothing," rejoined C. Bloxham, Jr. "For example, somebody might have put them there to draw suspicion upon poor Tripp."</p>
                  <p>"Pish—sh!" exclaimed the General, angrily. "Chester, don't talk like a fool; these gold pieces have been found in the valise of that man; furthermore, Mr. Roget, an estimable gentleman, whom you all have the pleasure of knowing, and who I regret is not present this evening, will furnish some damaging testimony against the prisoner."</p>
                  <p>"Please allow me to look at those gold pieces," asked Daisey, to the surprise of the boarders, now advancing with modest mien.</p>
                  <p>The General shrugged his shoulders scornfully, and reluctantly handed them to her.</p>
                  <p>"I believe these are the same coins I gave Mr. Tripp," she said, after attentively examining them; "indeed there can be no mistake," she added joyfully, "here are my initials which I remember I scratched on them with the point of a pin."</p>
                  <p>All looked, and sure enough the letters; "D. B." were faintly traced thereon.</p>
                  <p>"That settles the matter," said C. Bloxham, Jr., drawing a deep breath of relief. "Father, Mr. Jopps, I hope you are both convinced.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Jopps colored violently and stared at the General, who in turn appeared confounded.</p>
                  <p>"How came Daisey with this money?" blustered the General, rallying again, and renewing the attack with fresh courage.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Links paid them to me as the balance of my account," returned Daisey quietly.</p>
                  <p>General Bloxham blew his nose to conceal his chagrin, and observed philosophically, to Mr. Jopps:</p>
                  <p>"I suppose we might as well let the fellow go."</p>
                  <p>"By all means," rejoined Mr. Jopps in evident disgust. "So far as I am concerned I have no further charge to make against the man."</p>
                  <p>At this stage of the proceeding a pull at the door bell announced another caller. It was Mr. Links, who came to inquire for Daisey.</p>
                  <p>The tightly laced waiting-maid, who between the excitement of the evening and perpetual motion was verging on apoplexy, promptly escorted the lawyer to the dining-room; he paused at the threshold, surprised at the scene before him.</p>
                  <p>There stood Jasper Tripp handcuffed, the officer at his side gravely waiting further instructions, while Mr. Jopps, with arms folded, appeared to be in rapt contemplation of the ceiling. The discomfited General frowning at Daisey, who, with flushed face and sparkling eyes, gazed proudly around, conscious of victory.</p>
                  <p>But, to make assurance doubly sure, there was Mr. Links to connect the chain of evidence. She beckoned him to her side with a quiet air of dignity.</p>
                  <p>"Do you remember the kind of money which you paid over to me as the balance of my little legacy?" she asked.</p>
                  <p>"I do," replied Mr. Links promptly, "it was two gold ten-dollar pieces."</p>
                  <p>A dead silence followed this reply; every one seemed impressed with the conviction that Jasper was innocent; even the officer hastily released his hands and slunk away muttering a few coarse apologies. The General felt that he had been completely routed, and looked crestfallen and confused.</p>
                  <p>But another surprise was reserved for the company: Mr. Links had been watching. Jasper with his keen eye, and now walked up to him.</p>
                  <p>"In the name of wonder, Colonel, how came you here?"</p>
                  <p>Jasper put his finger to his mouth to enjoin silence, but it was too late. Every one noticed the movement and the deference shown to him by the lawyer. It sent a thrill of apprehension to the bosom of the General.</p>
                  <p>"Excuse me, Mr. Links," the General said, as Jasper turned away. "There seems to be some mystery attached to that follow."</p>
                  <p>"No mystery, I assure you," returned Mr. Links, smiling; "Colonel Tripp is an eccentric gentleman of California; he is better known in San Francisco as the millionaire of the El Dorado."</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Millionaire!</emph>" exclaimed the astonished General; his crest fell, and without another word he dissolved into the perspective, a beaten man.</p>
                  <p>A loud scream from Mrs. Beeswig here diverted the attention of everybody as that lady dropped insensible in the arms of the French professor.</p>
                  <p>The following note fluttered from her hand, which was instantly caught up by the curious and furnished a ready explanation:</p>

                  <p>"J. Mallow, at your service," replied Jasper, with a pleasant smile. "Uncle Jopps, you know me now."</p>
                  <p>The color forsook the face of the ex-broker; his knees trembled. He stood before the relation he had once despised and persecuted, in all the humility of conscious guilt.</p>
                  <p>"Jasper," he murmured fawningly, "pardon me, I have done wrong."</p>
                  <p>"With all my heart," responded Jasper kindly, "and now, ladies and gentlemen," he added, addressing the gaping assemblage of boarders, "since my friend and lawyer, Mr. Links, has revealed my disguise, permit me to explain why it was assumed. I left this city a poor boy. I return a wealthy man. I came, anxious to revisit the scenes of my childhood, longing to meet old faces and landmarks which I had garnered in the storehouse of my memory with affectionate faith. I chose to wear the garb and semblance of poverty in order to assure myself of the strength and fervor of old attachments.</p>
                  <p>"The result has satisfied me; even in this house I have found but two whom I could call my friends; they have cheered me in my gloomy pilgrimage, softened the dark shadows of my prison house, taught me to think less harshly of human nature; Chester, give me your hand, you will never find mine withhold in the hour of trouble or adversity. Daisey, it was I who gave you a fortune and took it away; you have lost it only to gain another. I have roamed the world in search of a pure and trusting heart—need I say, dear child-wife, I have found one?"</p>
                  <p>Daisey's heart was too full to speak; her eyes were lifted in mute eloquence to his in that language which love can best interpret.</p>
                  <p>And when the soft glow of returning summer came, they joined hands and walked out in the golden sunlight of life.</p>

               <head>THE PEOPLE'S CHOICE FOR ALDERMAN.</head>
               <head type="sub">AN ELECTION SKETCH.</head>
               <p>Harry Hardup was sitting on a barrel in Bill Swodler's number one liquor store, which is painted green outside, and beautifully decorated within with a handsome silver-plated bar, closely reminding one of a huge coffin, when he was accosted with a heavy slap on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>Hardup turned round to encounter the twinkling eyes and intellectual countenance of Jimmy Dedbeat, a confidential and much esteemed friend, whose stubby figure and bull neck is recognized at all the primary and ward meetings as well as familiar in the localities where cheap whiskey is vended at five cents a glass.</p>
               <p>Dedbeat is a well-dressed gentleman, with a bullet-shaped head and an uncommonly red face; a cigar reposes between his teeth while his stove-pipe hat is invariably cocked on one side, characteristic individualities which distinguish Dedbeat as superior to the ordinary bar-room loafer.</p>
               <p>"Look ahere," observed Jimmy Dedbeat, gracefully balancing himself on one leg and taking his cigar momentarily from his mouth. "I've got an idea in my head; damme, you know my head is always full of ideas."</p>
               <p>"When it isn't full of whiskey, Jimmy," returned Hardup, gravely.</p>
               <p>"That's so, by —," returned Dedbeat, frankly. "Just now the idea prevalates; in fact, Hardup, I've a sticking notion of running for Alderman this fall."</p>
               <p>"It requires twenty thousand dollars in gold or greenbacks to get elected," said the practical Hardup. "How much money, Jimmy, have you got?"</p>
               <p>"Not a continental stamp, as H. W. says when a feller asks him to accommodate," returned Dedbeat with a knowing grin; "but I'll bet a keg of lager I can raise the cash in twenty-four hours, if you will lend me a helping hand."</p>
               <p>"I'll lend you a couple of hands, or six dozen or so, if you want 'em; but, in the matter of money, you know, I'm played out."</p>
               <p>"All right," replied Dedbeat, puffing at his cigar. "Step in this room, Hal, and we'll talk the thing over. Billy, just mix us a couple of gin sours, will you? Well, here we are alone, Hardup; so now one thing is certain, I must get the money to elect me Alderman; I must raise the wind somehow."</p>
               <p>"Raise it then, I say," rejoined Hardup, "as long as you don't bother me."</p>
               <p>"What's the use of being in such a hurry?" said Dedbeat, angrily. "Now, all I want of you is a helping hand; you know William Frawd; he's as rich as a Jew—got his money on Government contracts, lives in the Fifth Avenue, in a brown stone front, eats saddlerock oysters, and drinks prime whiskey; he is a pious rogue; has a church pew with a lock and key to keep the 'swell mob' out. He's the one to do a nice job in the contract way—he'll do anything on good security. Now what better security can I offer him, in case I'm chosen Alderman of this district?"</p>
               <p>"Dedbeat, give me your hand," rejoined Hardup, with emotion; "you are a square man and would pass muster in the Gold Exchange. I take you now; you want me to go straw bail and swear you in, eh?"</p>
               <p>"Understand me; I've a dozen others that'll do the same; William Frawd will then hand the cash to elect me; in return I'm to give him a fat contract from the Board. All you've got to do is to swear that you have the German vote in your pocket. Billy will swear he's got the Irish in his, and the thing is done."</p>
               <p>"A big thing," laughed Hardup; "you're a live cuss, Jimmy, and ought to be President of a Railroad Company."</p>
               <p>The two friends then shook hands, drank two or three pints of Billy's best Bourbon, and, in company with Mr. Swodler, sallied down to Frawd's office.</p>
               <p>William Frawd was a notable character of Gotham. He was rich in houses, lands, and theatres; he was rich in steamboats and monopoly shares; he was the silent partner in stupendous lottery and gift enterprises, and money rolled in golden and<figure>
                     <head>JIMMY DEDBEAT CONFERS WITH HIS POLITICAL FRIENDS.</head>
                  </figure>
                  <pb n="-83" xml:id="VAC5830-00000047"/> paper avalanches in his coffers; but his avarice was far ahead of his gains and he longed for some other means of enriching himself. He was occupied in writing a threatening letter to a poor widow who owed him ten dollars, as the three bullet-headed gentlemen entered his office. He knew them all as ward politicians of some reputation, but when he heard that Mr. Dedbeat wanted money, he buttoned up his pockets and began to talk about "hard times—money was awful scarce." Here Dedbeat handed him a cigar and whispered in his ear, "fat contract ahead, old boy." The Honorable William Frawd's countenance changed and a pleasant smile illuminated it. He listened with respectful attention to the representations from Hardup and Billy Swodler, and was satisfied the security was good.</p>
               <p>The result of the interview may be briefly summed up. Dedbeat came out of the office with a check for the first instalment of the election loan, and with characteristic energy commenced to make preparations for the contest. His first great movement was to inaugurate a target company composed of all the first-class bullies and roughs of the district. It was called the "Jimmy Dedbeat Target Association," and weekly paraded over to Hoboken and Coney Island on excursions commanded by Captain Harry Hardup, who, with difficulty prevented his men from murdering every peaceable citizen they met. They signalized themselves as sharpshooters by popping unavailingly at a white-faced target at twelve paces, the aforesaid target presenting at the end of three months such a clean appearance as perfectly scandalized the sight of Captain Hardup, who ordered a dozen balls to be driven through it, and the bull's eye smashed in; then the glorious emblem was hung up in Billy Swodler's bar to excite the envy and admiration of all the loafers from Pearl to Mackerelville.</p>
               <p>In the meanwhile a contest was apparently going on for the nomination; but that was already secured by the forethought and sagacity of Dedbeat, who had thoroughly wire-pulled the committee of the previous year, and left the issue completely at his disposal. Though opposed by two lager bier aspirants and one ex-prize-fighter, Dedbeat was duly nominated by the Convention that met at the Row House. James Dedbeat was solemnly declared the nominee for Alderman of the great Reform party. He was called upon for a speech, but in rising to thank his friends for the honor conferred upon him, words failed him, and he could only reiterate that he was "all right, and was going to be the next Alderman—that was so, by —. If anybody wanted to fight him, they might find him at any hour of the day after ten A. M., at Billy Swodler's wine store, and he would give 'em h—l!" At which eloquent and pathetic remarks he was greeted with loud cheers, and immediately descending from the platform, invited all to take a drink, an invitation that was accepted with becoming alacrity.</p>
               <p>In a word, the prospects seemed highly flattering to the ambitious schemes of our hero. The only competitor who as yet presumed to oppose his claims, was a talented young lawyer, who could talk like a number one orator, but Dedbeat kept his mouth shut during the canvass by engaging him to manage a case, and slipping in his hand a handsome retaining fee.</p>
               <p>The bait took; the young lawyer sat himself down to his law books and energetically went to work on his brief, while Dedbeat as earnestly directed his attention to the Aldermanship. Having no talent for speech-making, Dedbeat imitated the illustrious mon of the day by initiating a kind of levee in every bar-room in the voting district, shaking hands with everybody, and generously inviting the crowd to drink on all occasions. A posse of his half-drunken partisans were continually at his heels, to all of whom he made liberal promises of offices and sinecures, in case he was elected Alderman.</p>
               <p>The district was a large one, numbering more than eight thousand voters. Dedbeat, as yet, had walked over the course without encountering serious opposition; but while congratulating himself on the success of his manœuvres, he was thrown in a state of some excitement to learn that a powerful rival was about to contest his claims to the aldermanic prize. This personage was Nicholas Sharp, a retired grocery merchant. He was supported by Wopples, the lager bier man, who confidently claimed to possess a considerable share of the German vote in his pocket, and expressed the belief that Sharp would be the next Alderman. Sharp had certainly some excellent advantages: he was shrewd and cunning, had a ready flow of coarse language, and was not afraid to address the people from the stump. He possessed likewise a portly-sized stomach, which he ostentatiously displayed to the<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC5830-00000048"/> voters of the Bully district, as indicating aldermanic proportions, and an unquestionable proof of his fitness for the position.</p>
               <p>Indeed, the sagacious politician made such rapid headway in popular favor that his mere appearance before the bar-room loungers and repeaters of the district created an extraordinary enthusiasm, which could only be explained by the circumstance that a keg of lager was invariably tapped for their accommodation.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, the partisans of Dedbeat were loud in the praises of their champion, who they swore could drink whiskey by the quart measure, and in his younger days had been honorably identified with the glorious P. R.</p>
               <p>As the day of election approached, the canvass grew more animated; extensive arrangements for a grand mass meeting, by the friends of Dedbeat, were already in progress.</p>
               <p>A large banner, with "<hi rend="i"/>James Dedbeat the People's choice for Alderman of the Bully District" inscribed thereon, was flung from the attic window of the Row House, and floated majestically across the street. Captain Hardup's Target Company, as they paraded by, greeted it with enthusiastic cheers.</p>
               <p>Before evening had fairly set in, an enormous transparency was displayed from the entrance of the Row House, announcing that "a grand Rally of the Voters of the District favorable to the election of James Dedbeat, would be held in the hall at 8 P. M." In surety of this pledge, at 7 P. M. a rocket went hissing skyward, bursting with a cracking report into innumerable green and crimson stars; at the same instant, the No. 2 Ward Club, Billy Swodler, president, came marching along, six hundred strong, making the welkin ring with hearty cheers for Dedbeat. This was followed by the inspiring sounds of martial music from the Row House; another rocket went hissing upward, and, catching the general infection of excitement, laborers, roughs, sports, barroom loungers, half-grown men and boys surged up stairs in double file and rapidly filled the big hall. The band of music commences "Hail Columbia," in the midst of which a side door, near the speaker's stand, opened, and a dozen bullet-headed gentlemen, with their hats in their hands, filed out and with becoming dignity ascend the platform. This is a signal for a hurricane of applause, whereupon a squint-eyed member of the delegation advances and commands silence by an authoritative rap of his knuckles on the table. Order having been restored, he proposes that "John Gammon be appointed Chairman of this Meeting, and Tony Punch, Secretary." This being agreed to by a tremendous and deafening shout of "aye," John Gammon and Tony Punch step forward, and modestly take their respective seats, which is the occasion for another outburst of applause. The Secretary reads the list of the Vice-Presidents, who are all very celebrated men; then the Chairman rises amidst profound silence and says: "I congratulate you, fellow-citizens, on this imposing demonstration in favor of popular reform. We have met, this evening, to ratify the nomination of that staunch, uncompromising friend of the people; that unswerving champion of equal rights; that true and honest advocate of Justice and an economical administration of the City Government—James Dedbeat. (Great applause.) He now stands before you—he is sitting in a chair, fellow-citizens, and you can just see the top of his head. (Renewed applause.) It is another instance of that rare modesty, so rarely encountered in our public men, which causes him to shrink from the gaze of publicity. Fellow-citizens, he was nominated, need I say, against his inclination; but, waiving the paltry considerations of office for the sake of his country, he has consented to be your standard-bearer in the coming contest. (Great applause.) He loathes, fellow-citizens, the selfish ambition of the demagogue, and with one eye directed on the 'Star-spangled Banner' and the other on the 'green flag of Erin' and ancient banner of Hapsburg, he proudly points to his past record and boldly defies the malice of his political foes. (Loud applause.) And, fellow-citizens, it is with great pleasure I now introduce to you New York's favorite son, your candidate for Alderman, the Honorable James Dedbeat." (Prolonged and enthusiastic applause.)</p>
               <p>Here Hardup whispered in Dedbeat's ear, "Now's your chance to make a splendid speech! go it hunkie!" Dedbeat had been all the previous day drawing inspiration from the soda fountain in Billy Swodler's undertaker's shop, and was extremely unwilling to rise. The dismayed Chairman and his friends forced him, however, on his logs and pushed him to the front. "Make a speech, or you are politically a ruined man," growled General Bang Swang, in an under tone. "Say something," hissed another committee man, "they expect it."</p>
               <p>Dedbeat, thus unceremoniously propelled before the audience, gazed defiantly around; the crowd kept on cheering lustily; but when the candidate for aldermanic honors released himself from his friend's grasp and shook his fist threateningly, a perfect tempest of applause echoed through the building.</p>
               <p>"What's the use of talking?" he yelled in a hoarse, squeaking voice. "Ain't I candidate for Alderman? ain't that enough? Leave me alone and don't bother me; I'm all right!"</p>
               <p>"Hip, hip, hurrah!" roared the crowd, and amidst the enthusiasm created by this telling speech, Dedbeat was pushed back into his seat by his political friends, and General Bang Swang hastily stopped forward and, in a brief but pertinent address, showed the people how necessary, important, and vital it was to the future peace and welfare of the city that James Dedbeat should be elected Alderman. Several other speakers, in a similar strain, addressed the meeting, which continued until a late hour.</p>
               <p>The reporter had a five-dollar greenback pressed into his hand by a friend of the candidate, and thereupon the speech of Dedbeat, revised and improved, appeared in full in the columns of the <title>Morning Comet</title>, as follows:</p>
               <p>"Fellow-Citizens,—Words cannot adequately convey my emotion at this unexpected and very flattering reception, and I hope it will not be deemed impertinent or vain, if I accept it as a proof of your undiminished confidence in my past political record. (Applause.) Honored by your approbation and grateful for these continual marks of your regard, I can do no less than reiterate my devoted attachment to those principles of government which form the bulwark of our political faith. (Applause.) It is my duty, as a sacred duty committed to every public servant, to keep a vigilant eye on the interests of even the humblest citizen of our proud municipality, and jealously guard the sacred palladium of our liberties. (Applause.)</p>
               <p>"When I look around our great city, swarming with an active, enterprising, and intelligent population; when I turn my eyes towards your beautiful Hudson, and behold the steamboats ploughing their sinuous course, and the hissing engine skimming its banks; when I see hundreds of ships freighted with the commerce and industry of your people, dotting the surface of your noble bay, I am led to exclaim in the language of the immortal poet: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Lives there a man with soul so dead</l>
                        <l>Who never to himself hath said:</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">This is my own, my native land?"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>(Loud applause.)</p>
               <p>This speech proved a decided hit. It was read and commented upon by everybody, as the very able and patriotic address of the Honorable James Dedbeat, candidate for Alderman of the Bully district. It is true, some of the people who were present at the public meeting were inclined to doubt whether the above speech was precisely the exact language of their favorite, while others remembered the applause was so enthusiastic they could not hear it at all; however, it was read with much approval and praise by the politicians, excepting Nicholas Sharp, who did not hesitate to declare that the aforesaid speech had a slight flavor of gammon.</p>
               <p>The day of election is at hand at last; while Gotham puts on her usual stereotyped garb of active, restless labor, and the crowds of pedestrians serge backward and forward in historic Broadway, the ward politicians, a world by themselves, are to be seen grouped in each precinct, while others are driving frantically about in open carriages with a couple of voters between them to vote early and often. At first the election progresses quietly enough, and to a common observer the scene is suggestive of little interest. Ticket booths, with large, staring posters announcing that "<hi rend="i"/>Jimmy Dedbeat guns for Alderman in this Ward," are scattered round the polls. A dozen or so of politicians stand listlessly conversing, the monotony only broken by a fresh arrival of voters, a scramble for the inside of the polls, a mock challenge from a bullet-headed inspector, a coarse laugh, and the voter deposits his vote and retires.</p>
               <p>At 12 M. the neighborhood of the various polling places were growing more populous; crowds of workmen were voting the straight ticket in a crooked line, which extended across the street. A gentleman with an exceedingly red nose offers to bet drinks against the whole crowd that Nicholas Sharp will get over one thousand majority in the Seventeenth Ward. This challenge eliciting no response, the red-nosed gentleman<pb n="86 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5830-00000049"/> man becomes excited, denounces the "Dedbeat Target Association" as a fraud, and expresses his ability "to lick any man of his size." Nobody evidencing a disposition to controvert this proposition, the red-nosed gentleman declines into imbecility, sings a comic song, and is unceremoniously led away by a policeman while in the act of making a speech announcing his patriotic intention of running for the State Senate.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the voters were increasing steadily, and challenges lively and frequent. Joe Wopples, a partisan of Nicholas Sharp, confidentially informed his friends that "the Dedbeat mon are repeating like h—l."</p>
               <p>3. P. M. An immense crowd assembled round the polls, near the Row House, and though all the lager bier and wine saloons were decorously closed (the front way), the people seemed wild with enthusiasm.</p>
               <p>Swaying to and fro, cursing and yelling like demons, they presented, as an English traveller eloquently observed, "a lively and pleasing illustration of the mercurial and patriotic character of American politicians."</p>
               <p>In this ward the Dedbeat faction largely preponderated, and whenever a voter had the temerity to avow himself a partisan of Nicholas Sharp, he was incontinently knocked down and dragged out by the ferocious crowd.</p>
               <p>Now and then a cry of "fight" and a general rush towards the point of interest would bring an eager reporter ready to take notes; his usual query eliciting the stereotyped reply: "Whiskey, whiskey, that's what's the matter."</p>
               <p>Apart from all this uproar, the friends of Dedbeat were working with quiet confidence. Their Head-Quarters at the Row House were thronged with earnest politicians who puffed vigorously at their cigars, and discussed the chances of their candidate.</p>
               <p>"Jimmy is polling an awful vote in the Fourteenth."</p>
               <p>"Yes, he'll carry that ward, sure pop."</p>
               <p>"How are we getting on in the Seventeenth?</p>
               <p>"Bully, you may bet, Jimmy polls ton votes to Sharp's six."</p>
               <p>"Is <emph>that so</emph>?"</p>
               <p>"That <emph>is</emph> so."</p>
               <p>Pending this eloquent and instructive dialogue, a hack led by two lean horses drove furiously towards the polls. It contained a solitary voter, who dropped quickly out of the vehicle, and was immediately surrounded by a crowd of boisterous politicians.</p>
               <p>"Have you voted?" "Have you voted?" cried a dozen eager voices.</p>
               <p>"No," roared the solitary voter.</p>
               <p>"Then you have a precious small time to do it in," rejoined a ticket-holder. "The polls close in two minutes; hurry up; who do you vote for Alderman?"</p>
               <p>"Nicholas Sharp."</p>
               <p>"Got out!" growled a pock-marked ruffian, flourishing a handful of Dedbeat tickets in the face of the astonished voter. "Here's yer ticket for Alderman."</p>
               <p>"Let the man alone," interposed a Sharp ticket-holder with an oath. "Here's the right ticket, sir. Hurry up, if you want to deposit your vote before the polls close."</p>
               <p>The solitary voter struggled hopelessly in the dense mass of roughs who purposely impeded his progress; he remonstrated, entreated, threatened, in vain; he was pushed, jostled and trod upon relentlessly.</p>
               <p>"What's the use of all this row," cried the pock-marked ruffian in a tone of ironical sympathy. "If the poor cuss wants to vote, I say let him vote. Let us have peace."</p>
               <p>This humorous sally was received with peals of derisive laughter, and the Dedbeat crowd amused themselves with further playful demonstrations, such as treading on the solitary voter's tees, jamming the solitary voter's hat over his eyes, and thrusting their elbows in the solitary voter's side, until the abused man was glad to limp away vowing vengeance against his tormentors.</p>
               <p>And now amidst terrific cheers and cries of "all right" the polls closed; the crowd gradually melted away to give place at half-past eight to a more decorous but no less demonstrative assemblage, all eager to catch the flying reports, which, carried on the wings of Rumor, are provokingly uncertain and tantalizingly unreliable.</p>
               <p>Bonfires were burning in every voting precinct, and in the neighborhood of the Row House a vast <choice>
                     <sic>hetacomb</sic>
                     <corr>hecatomb</corr>
                  </choice> of flaming boxes and barrels brilliantly illuminated surrounding objects.</p>
               <p>The impatient multitude, anxiously awaiting the returns, were at last gladdened about 11 o'clock P. M. by the first gun from Dedbeat's own ward, giving him a majority of 1,500, which was hailed with vociferous cheers.</p>
               <p>This news was somewhat neutralized, however, a half hour afterward, by the startling intelligence that the Seventeenth<figure>

                  </figure>
                  <pb n="-87" xml:id="VAC5830-00000050"/> Ward had gone for Sharp by over 800. Groans for Sharp. (A voice)—"How about the Sixteenth Ward?"</p>
               <p>A corpulent gentleman here officiously mounted the steps of the Row House and bellowed out in a stentorian tone: "No returns as yet from the Sixteenth Ward!"</p>
               <p>The corpulent gentleman was thereupon called upon for a speech, but declined emphatically with something of a defiant air, which gave rise to innumerable playful remarks touching the corpulent gentleman's antecedents, the majority of the crowd affecting to recognize him as an old acquaintance, and familiarly styling him "the buzzard." This puts the audience in high good humor, and amidst shouts of laughter the corpulent gentleman drops from his perch and disappears.</p>
               <p>But now all eyes are turned towards a cab that comes whirling up the street followed by a noisy crowd. The vehicle stops before the Row House, and General Bang Swang leaps out holding in one hand a mysterious document, and in the other a flag which he waves excitedly to and fro. "Fellow-citizens," he bawls. "<emph>The returns are in from all the wards and James Dedbeat is elected Alderman by more than two thousand majority!</emph>"</p>
               <p>Tremendous cheering followed this announcement, and then, to satisfy the minds of the skeptical, an illuminated transparency was raised in front of the Row House giving the following convincing figures: <table>
                     <row>
                        <cell>James Dedbeat</cell>
                        <cell>5,242</cell>
                     </row>
                     <row>

                        <cell>2,414</cell>
                     </row>
                  </table>
               </p>
               <p>The crowd rushed for the Row House, and shouted for the Alderman elect. General Bang Swang was compelled to show his bald head outside, and thank the people in behalf of the victorious candidate, who, owing to a severe indisposition (contracted at Billy's wine store), would be unable to respond in person.</p>
               <p>"He would never forget their gallant support while a heart remained to throb in his bosom, or his tongue could chant their praise. (Cheers.) The most unscrupulous means had been resorted to, in order to defeat the Honorable James Dedbeat; even his irreproachable character had been ruthlessly assailed; the vilest epithets, which he (General Bang Swang) would not insult his high-minded and intelligent audience by reporting, had been hurled upon his devoted head; but the people had justly rebuked his slanderers by rolling up for him such an overwhelming majority as had never before been given to a candidate from that district." (Wild cheering.)</p>
               <p>In conclusion, the General "thanked the people for nobly vindicating the integrity and spotless reputation of the Bully district, by electing an honest and faithful public servant to the responsible and onerous position of alderman, and as the sun dissolved the mists, so would the clouds of prejudice disperse before the mighty influences of truth and justice."</p>
               <p>The General then bowed and withdrew amidst immense applause.</p>
               <p>There was a light in one of the upper windows of the Row House, the chamber which contained the sacred but helpless person of the Alderman elect; who, as he was put to bed by his faithful friends, Billy Swodler and Harry Hardup, muttered hoarsely: "I'm elected; that's so; Billy, bring me three gin sours; what's the use of talking; ain't I Alderman!"</p>

               <head>THE POLICEMAN'S STORY.</head>
               <p>I was not prepared when I hired the attic at seven dollars in advance to surrender dignity, opinions and character, to endure the imposition of one towel a week and cracker pudding (an ingenious device of Miss Sangammon) for five consecutive days. It will be considered as indubitable evidence of my unparalleled good nature as well as proof positive of the dangerous influence she was exercising over my destiny, that for one month, counting twenty-eight days from my arrival, I submissively <emph>did</emph> endure it.</p>
               <p>I am bold enough to avow, even with the certainty of these observations meeting Miss Sangammon's eye, that petticoat government may curtail a man's liberty even in this blessed land of Freedom; and Miss Sangammon, though a small-sized spinster,<pb n="88" xml:id="VAC5830-00000051"/> hard on to fifty, shrill-voiced and thin lipped, ruled her boarders—four dry goods clerks and three light porters—by some mysterious mesmeric power, and had already formed the ambitious project of reducing me under the same despotic authority.</p>
               <p>I had ventured to dispute her claims even when astonished at my own temerity. I had said politely, "Madam, will you allow me to remind you I had only one towel last week?" and the lady's reply struck me as being eminently forcible, not to say decisive: "Mr. Copples, the Attic has always been provided with one towel per week; and, Mr. Copples, as far as my recollection extends, the Attic has never before <emph>found</emph> fault with one towel per week." Here Miss Sangammon turned very red, appealing, in a slightly tremulous voice, to Mr. Beasly, who, as the fashionable dry goods clerk, claimed to be the most aristocratic, if whether to <emph>his</emph> knowledge he had ever known the Attic <emph>to</emph> complain. It was a disgusting proof of Miss Sangammon's influence over this misguided young man, that he did declare positively, from his own personal information, that my predecessor had occupied the attic for eight months and eleven days without so much as a syllable of remonstrance or complaint passing his lips.</p>
               <p>It was provoking to have Miss Sangammon, at the supper table, maliciously renew the subject, and refer to the Attic (my predecessor) "as a perfect gentleman," thereby insinuating the reverse of Jerry Copples. It was hard to be badgered and bullied systematically every day thereafter by Miss Sangammon's frequent allusions to her former <emph>excellent</emph> tenant, the Attic, who I subsequently discovered had slipped off owing three weeks' board, and in a fit of absence of mind carried with him a dozen German silver spoons, and several other light articles of housekeeping.</p>
               <p>I could plainly see I must overcome Miss Sangammon or haul down my flag. So one morning at breakfast I mustered all my available courage to meet the crisis, and in a weak voice announced to her that "I thought of changing my boarding-house."</p>
               <p>The effect was indescribable; Miss Sangammon grew hysterical, and immediately turned to her referee, Mr. Beasly, with the pertinent inquiry, if, under every circumstance, she had not labored zealously to please the Attic; whether she had ever made any distinction or showed the slightest favoritism to compromise the Attic; whether, in short, she had not uniformly studied the comfort and convenience of the aforesaid Attic?</p>
               <p>Mr. Beasly, the grovelling Beasly, was emphatic in the expression of his opinion, that Miss Sangammon had all but sacrificed herself, owing to her devotion to the Attic, and that the Attic, by this public and unprecedented course, had not only wounded the feelings of his respected landlady, but had likewise, by implication, inflicted a wanton insult upon every boarder present. Mr. Jams, the oldest light porter, cheerfully concurred in the remarks of his friend Mr. Beasly; he had nothing whatever to say against Mr. Copples, as a policeman, far from it, and would simply avow the impression that as an individual he, Mr. Copples, was slightly unpopular.</p>
               <p>I would have answered the barbarians; but there sat Miss Sangammon, bolt upright in her chair, her shrewish eyes directed full in my face, and as the confidential opinion of Jerrie Copples, allow him to say that at this especial moment he would have preferred charging single-handed a mob of rioters than ventured a reply before the powerful, omnipotent Miss Sangammon.</p>
               <p>Perhaps she doubted whether I would have the courage to carry out my declaration. At dinner, finding no indications of my threatened departure, derived from a private personal inspection of my trunk during my absence, she assumed a very complaisant air, and actually invited me to a second slice of pudding, an invitation which caused a decided sensation among the boarders, as a compliment only occasionally extended to the front parlor, when that important individual was a pleasant and profitable reality.</p>
               <p>But, notwithstanding all the arts and devices of the enemy, I boldly packed my trunk and hired a small boy to carry it to my new lodgings in Macdougal street, which movement I cleverly executed while Miss Sangammon was busy compounding yeast powder rolls for supper.</p>
               <p>The secrecy with which I managed this difficult undertaking, the careful reconnaissance I made at the head of the staircase ere I crept off stealthily on tiptoe, my green cotton umbrella under my arm, must have vividly impressed the small boy with the conviction that Miss Sangammon was the victim of a popular swindle, which, in<pb n="Illustration-89" xml:id="VAC5830-00000052"/>

                     <head>GERTRUDE MELLOWS.</head>
                  </figure> view of a handsome fee, he was bound to bring to a successful issue, darting out of the house like a young thief, the trunk on his head, and congratulating me upon my success, when I rejoined him at the next corner, by whirling his thumb on the side of his nose with the expressive declaration that I had "chiselled the old 'oman, sure pop."</p>
               <p>I was happy over my victory; my new lodgings in Macdougal street was a snug little corner chamber, the very picture of neatness, looking down on an old-fashioned arbor where the half-ripened grapes were clinging in luxuriant profusion, perfuming the air so deliciously, that I can never snuff the aroma of a grape vine without recalling one lovely face and all the correlative events crowded in a few months' space.</p>
               <p>My new landlady, Mrs. Mellows, was very different from Miss Sangammon, both in personal appearance and manners; a slight, tall female of thirty-eight, with traces of great beauty, lingering still on her pale Grecian features. Lydia Mellows, poor woman, was never intended to keep a boarding-house—the reverse of Miss Sangammon in every particular; her house seemed like wax-work; the clean stone steps, the shining panel and burnished door bell reflected the neatness within; her table was generously supplied with the best the market could afford, and yet she frankly admitted she found it difficult to obtain boarders, chiefly for the reason that Mrs. Grimeby had opened a fashionable establishment at the corner, which had remorselessly swallowed up all the profitable customers, including book-keepers, salesmen, and apothecary boys. She, Mrs. Mellows, could only boast of one solitary boarder, a Mr. Jangle, a great mathematician, who had expressly selected her house on account of its retirement. Mr. Jangle, being desirous that everybody should walk on tiptoe over head and converse in monosyllabic whispers while studying out his abstruse problems, had been driven by the force of public opinion from Mrs. Grimeby's, and had privately expressed the opinion that Mrs. Grimeby and Mrs. Grimeby's boarders were "nuisances." He had likewise volunteered the suggestion that Mrs. Mellows would find it beneficial to her interests not to increase the number of her boarders, and out of deference to Mr. Jangle she had made little effort to obtain them. I would remark again, with the utmost respect for Mrs. Mellows, she was clearly unfitted to walk in the steps of Miss Sangammon; good-natured and devoid of art, she was plaything of every capricious humor, the victim of every selfish design; yet I was pleased with her gentle face the moment I encountered it, and mightily delighted with my snug chamber looking down on the arbor of grape vines, which in comparison with the attic of Miss Sangammon seemed an elysium indeed.</p>
               <p>When I arrived at Mrs. Mellows' house I was reluctantly permitted to enter by a red-faced girl, who in the absence of Mrs. Mellows peremptorily objected to the trunk going to my chamber. "A policeman," she said, "had engaged the room, and I didn't look much like one." I attempted to explain that when off duty I were citizen's dress and condescended to show the obdurate young lady my shield. This, so far from having the desired effect, caused the maid to toss her head and declare roundly her belief that the small boy and myself were leagued together to rob the house.</p>
               <p>This imputation giving rise to a lively discussion, in which the small boy participated by apostrophizing the young lady as "a fraud," I hastened to end the dispute by dismissing my young champion and retreating to the parlor, closely followed by the argus eyed maid.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mellows' parlor was just such a one as you seldom see in a boarding-house; handsome brocatel-covered chairs and ottomans, a rich brussels carpet, and rosewood piano. The walls were covered with a multitude of fine engravings, the central object of attraction being a full length portrait of a lovely girl, dressed in the costume of a Tyrolese peasant, who looked down from the canvas with a captivating smile, which seemed almost life itself. While I stood gazing at it, wondering if anything merely human could be half as beautiful, Mrs. Mellows entered with many courtesies and profuse apologies for the awkward blunder of her servant.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Copples," she remarked as she motioned me to a seat, "you were looking, I see, at that picture; do you think it resembles me?"</p>
               <p>Out of respect for Mrs. Mellows, and with not the slightest intention of being insincere, I did venture to observe in reply that "I could detect a slight resemblance."</p>
               <p>"How often persons have noticed it," returned<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC5830-00000053"/> turned Mrs. Mellows, a half sigh escaping her. "Ah me, there was a time when I could claim to look a little like the picture, but 'tis past; Mr. Copples, it is the portrait of my daughter Gertrude."</p>
               <p>"Your daughter," I repeated with an involuntary start. "What a lovely creature she must be."</p>
               <p>"She is handsome, quite as handsome as the portrait and <emph>so</emph> good; Mr. Copples, she is such a dear, faithful, kind girl," said Mrs. Mellows, a tear filling her eye.</p>
               <p>"I am glad to hear it, Madam," I replied, pleased myself at the idea. "I should judge from the portrait she was quite young."</p>
               <p>"Just eighteen years," rejoined Mrs. Mellows; "her birthday was yesterday. Oh, Mr. Copples, you don't know what a blessing that girl has been to me."</p>
               <p>"When I lost my husband, three years ago, leaving us utterly penniless, Gertrude determined I should not suffer; and she has kept her word."</p>
               <p>"She must be a smart girl."</p>
               <p>"I may be weak in thinking her one," rejoined Mrs. Mellows, affectionately glancing at the portrait; "<emph>dear me</emph>," she ejaculated with a start as a loud crash echoed from below. "There's Jane smashing the crockery again; that girl, Mr. Copples, is a perfect torment to me—breaking plates, cups, and saucers, from morning to night; but, as I was remarking, Gertrude came to me one day and said, 'Mother, I cannot bear to see the furniture or the piano sold, so I have been endeavoring to get my own living,' and then the dear girl poured all her hard earnings in my lap, which was enough to redeem the furniture and leave something handsome besides. It was a great surprise to me, for I could not understand how she could make so much money in such a short time; then she told me the secret. She had engaged herself as a ballet dancer to one of the first theatres, and was receiving a large salary."</p>
               <p>"A ballet dancer!" I exclaimed, scarcely able to repress a shudder.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Mrs. Mellows, with a flush of maternal pride; "it is very respectable employment, I am told, as long as a girl behaves herself, and my Gertrude is <emph>so</emph> good, an angel couldn't be more perfect, Mr. Copples."</p>
               <p>There was something very beautiful in the faith reposed by this simple-hearted and affectionate woman in her daughter's purity and worth. I will instance it as a remarkable circumstance that Jerrie Copples was slightly affected; but as I blew my nose very hard and gazed sternly out of the window, Mrs. Mellows did not perceive any alteration in my otherwise phlegmatic countenance.</p>
               <p>"She is a beautiful dancer," pursued Mrs. Mellows. "The newspapers have praised her highly, so extravagantly I can hardly realize it is my own daughter they are talking about; and then the gentlemen send her the loveliest bouquets."</p>
               <p>"She has, of course, many admirers."</p>
               <p>"Very many, more than I had all my life," said Mrs. Mellows with a happy laugh. "She treats them all well, shows no partiality, and is <emph>so</emph> particular; but there's that fearful Jane smashing another plate. I shall have to excuse myself, Mr. Copples, and take a peep down the kitchen—Jane requires to be constantly watched; every minute in the day she is breaking the china and laying it to the rats, which, of course it isn't."</p>
               <p>My landlady courtesied and withdrew, leaving me to ponder over the little sketch of her daughter, Gertrude, and wonder if she really was as beautiful as the fair prototype that smiled so bewitchingly from the canvas.</p>
               <p>As a middle-aged gentleman of rough, burly appearance, with short gray hair and stern features, I may venture the remark that I am not easily influenced by female charms, but since I had heard Gertrude's history I felt a strange interest to know more. The pretty parlor with its expensive furniture and rosewood plane seemed a mystery to me when I remembered ballet girls were poorly remunerated for their labors, even at the best theatres.</p>
               <p>As a general observation, and simply as Jerry Copples, I might add the world is made up of contradictions. Here I was torturing my mind with ugly suspicious against a young lady whose portrait had favorably impressed me: policemen are usually inquisitive, sometimes meddlesome, but waiving my official character, and speaking entirely as Jerry Copples, it occurred to me I was growing absurd, so I retired to my chamber, and took my customary nap to prepare for my night's patrol.</p>
               <p>At the tea-table I was introduced to Mr. Jangle the mathematician, a tall, lean gentleman with bristly hair, who gave me a side glance out of his spectacles as though he would cheerfully immolate me if he could, and who resolutely refused to enter into any conversation with amiable Mrs. Mellows otherwise than by an occasional grunt of "Ah, yes, humph! Ha!", which were ingeniously served up in a parenthesis form at different stages of Mrs. Mellows' remarks.</p>
               <p>There was a vacant seat opposite, which I suspected belonged to Miss Mellows; a gold napkin ring lying beside her plate, and a silver cup with "<hi rend="i"/>Gertrude" engraved thereon, rendered the surmise almost a certainty. Unable to divest myself of a bad habit contracted at Miss Sangammon's, I proceeded to stir my tea so briskly that Mrs. Mellows was sure I must want more sugar (Miss S. was never known to propound such an interesting inquiry), and in my confusion said "yes," and extended my cup, though Heaven knows I was sweetened past endurance already.</p>
               <p>Then the muffins—what a contrast to the yeast powder rolls of Miss Sangammon,—a delicate, fleecy white, something I had never seen before, and which I now buttered with all the awkwardness of a boy fresh from boarding-school. The rolls usually went hail fellow with an acid compound styled by Miss Sangammon as "damson" and which she invariably doled out (it was a mercy she did) in infinitesimal saucers; but here was a dish of genuine strawberry preserve that we might help ourselves to <foreign xml:lang="LAT">ad libitum</foreign>.</p>
               <p>Comparisons are odious, as Mrs. Somebody says. I don't pretend to be classical; however, as it is only Jerry Copples, I may venture to hope you will excuse the omission.</p>
               <p>I had fairly launched into the supper when a side door opened gently, and in stepped a graceful young lady of medium size, dressed in a fashionable blue silk, short enough to disclose two cunning little feet as were ever owned by mortal; she glided to the vacant seat, hurriedly stealing a glance at me, and in that glance revealing the charming Tyrolese peasant; a brunette complexion, lustrous dark eyes swimming with tenderness, a small nose such as Cleopatra might have envied, and a most exquisitely formed mouth, and coral lips, left nothing for art, scarcely less for nature to add.</p>
               <p>"This is my daughter, Gertrude," said Mrs. Mellows, with a proud, happy look, as I rose from my seat and bowed almost reverentially. "Gertrude, our new boarder, Mr. Copples!"</p>
               <p>She courtesied in return, not carelessly or affectedly, but in a timid way, her long eyelashes drooping before my respectful glance, as though the homage I had unconsciously paid her was something new and strange, and the more acceptable on that very account. She appeared besides in a singular flutter as she sank into her seat, confusedly throwing back her long curls as though anxious to escape my eye. I wondered at her agitation, although I don't think any one else noticed it. I was not young or vain enough to consider I could arouse in so beautiful a creature, even a momentary emotion of interest. I sagely conjectured that she was viewing me, not as Jerry Copples, but strictly in my official character, and had some reasons of her own for being a little frightened, perhaps only annoyed, at the unexpected meeting.</p>
               <p>But if she harbored such thoughts they were quickly dispelled; the glow returned to her cheeks, her tender eyes flashed, and her lips parted in the bewitching smile the artist had so well portrayed.</p>
               <p>"She is beautiful enough for a divinity," I mentally exclaimed, with my mouth full of strawberry preserve.</p>
               <p>Miss Gertrude had a soft, sweet voice, almost sad in intonation, that nevertheless vibrated pleasantly on my ear, as she inquired if I belonged to the Night patrol.</p>
               <p>I answered in the affirmative, whereupon Miss Mellows looked slightly disturbed, though I could not explain why, and sipped her tea thoughtfully.</p>
               <p>"I should think it would wear you out, Mr Copples," observed her mother sympathetically. "Yet I must say you look as rugged as an oak."</p>
               <p>"I am used to it, Madam; habit will inure a man to most anything."</p>
               <p>"That is a very truthful remark, Mr. Copples; habit is everything. I had a nephew once who was a great smoker. He would smoke a box of cigars a day, and as many at night; he even went to bed with a cigar in his mouth; the habit was a bad one, but the poor boy never could give up his favorite pastime, and finally smoked himself out of the world—the day of his death he was still puffing at one, and when he couldn't hardly draw a breath he beckoned me to him and whispered, 'put a box of 'em in my coffin, auntie,' and then died. Poor fellow, he<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC5830-00000054"/> persisted to the last that the habit did him good."</p>
               <p>"Humbug!" ejaculated Mr. Jangle in a deep bass voice. "Ha, humph!"</p>
               <p>These interjectory exclamations being strongly expressive of Mr. Jangle's contempt for the aforesaid smoker, Mrs. Mellows smiled, and Gertrude laughed.</p>
               <p>"Do <emph>you</emph> smoke, Mr. Jangle?" inquired the young lady playfully.</p>
               <p>"No," replied Mr. Jangle, elevating his eyebrow with a forbidding frown.</p>
               <p>"You forget, Gertrude, my love," said Mrs. Mellows in an explanatory tone, "that Mr. Jangle is strongly opposed to the use of tobacco in any form—Mr. Copples, will you have another cup?—and consequently he is very much prejudiced against smoking; if I remember aright, Mr. Jangle, you left several boarding-houses on that account?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," responded the mathematician solemnly.</p>
               <p>"And, dear Gertrude, you will please bear in mind that even the smell of the weed is offensive to Mr. Jangle: when travelling he invariably takes the ladies' car because there is a little placard posted up, 'No smoking allowed here,' or 'Smoking strictly prohibited,' which means of course nobody must smoke out of politeness to the ladies, though I don't object myself to the cigars, if it isn't a horrid meerschaum or a clay pipe similar to the humpback tailor's opposite, who always insists, you know, on smoking under my window when I wish it open, and snores fearfully when he takes his nap, which of course he can't prevent."</p>
               <p>Here Mr. Jangle interrupted voluble Mrs. Mellows by abruptly rising from the table, and leaving the room, not forgetting to utter a parting ejaculation of "humph!" expressive of his contempt for smokers in general, and Mrs. Mellows in particular.</p>
               <p>"You must excuse Mr. Jangle," observed Mrs. Mellows, turning to me with an apologetic smile. "He is rather abrupt in his manners, as the French say a little <foreign xml:lang="FRA">brusque</foreign>—but he is a real hard student, Mr. Copples, poring over his books all day and half the night; he has in his chamber an immense roll of paper, I really believe it is over a hundred yards in length, all covered over with minute figures not bigger than the point of a pin, which is a prediction of an approaching comet that he assures me won't strike the earth, because it happens to be in another direction, though it does frighten me to think of it. <emph>Mercy!</emph> there is Jane breaking another plate!"</p>
               <p>While listening to Mrs. Mellows, my eyes insensibly wandered to Gertrude. I noticed her lovely features were marred by slight traces of dissipation. A keen observant eye like mine could not avoid perceiving that beneath all her forced gaiety there lurked a deep and settled sadness.</p>
               <p>If the lovely girl had ever seemed a mystery it was then, as she rose from her chair, and coldly, half proudly courtesying to me, glided out of the room.</p>
               <p>And now the hour had approached when I must don my official costume, and report for duty. Once out on my beat, Miss Gertrude and even the dreaded name of Sangammon was forgotten. I was no longer Jerry Copples, but the stern-faced policeman, prying inquisitively around, trying door knobs, rattling window fastenings, peeping into every nook and corner, perhaps finding some hall door accidentally left open or warehouse exposed, to prove that all the careless people are not dead yet.</p>
               <p>Here stood a group of gamblers who silently made way for me, or a knot of professional thieves, coolly smoking and chatting, impudently oblivious of my presence; ragged bootblacks sauntered by with a wistful glance at my unpolished boots, and "how are ye, ole cop?" came from a cautious rough as he hurried his drunken companion past.</p>
               <p>The faded butterflies of vice flitted to and fro, while ever and anon the merry notes of a violin and harp might be heard in some basement concert saloon, or the drunken song of the reveller, mingling with the coarse laugh and ribald jest; gradually these sights and sounds ceased, the tread of pedestrians little by little diminished until only the occasional ring of an iron-heeled boot smote the pavement, or the monotonous jingle of the horse-car bells, as it swiftly rumbled by.</p>
               <p>The evening drew on apace, a chilliness in the atmosphere seemed to betoken a wet night, as I stood like a statue at the corner of Greene and Houston streets; at this moment my attention was arrested by a solitary figure, a figure I would have known anywhere, which even the cloak and hood could not conceal its grace of outline; a step light and airy which I had told from a million turned towards Houston, and passed me, unconscious I was so near that I might have caught her in my strong arms, and demanded why she was wandering in that lonely haunt of vice. But I let her pass, quietly following her, wondering, with a quick, sharp pang, if all I had conceived or dared to imagine were actual truth.</p>
               <p>The cloak and hood paused at last before a large gambling house—the bell was rung—a stalwart negro servant appeared at the door and silently admitted her, then it closed, leaving me to solitude and conjecture. Had I really identified in the wearer of the cloak and hood the beautiful Gertrude Mellows? Speaking frankly as Jerry Copples, without any desire to hide myself under the official character of a policeman, I felt a strong desire to clear up the mystery; so I lingered near the house, disturbed by a thousand surmises.</p>
               <p>Two-hours went by, and, weary of watching, I was moving away when the hall door of the establishment opened again, the cloak and hood reappeared, accompanied by a gentleman.</p>
               <p>The light from a neighboring gas-lamp streamed momentarily over the faces of both; the man, who was apparently about twenty-five, had been once exceedingly handsome, but whose features were sadly marred by signs of a dissolute life; a certain peculiarity in dress and bearing denoted him as a professional gambler; the lady (alas! that it should have been) was Gertrude Mellows.</p>
               <p>He paused for a moment to light a cigar, and then held out his arm to her with the freedom of an old acquaintance.</p>
               <p>"Gert," he remarked carelessly, "you have done well to-night; faro is a game which requires a woman to play it; by my faith, you looked magnificent when Dufrees staked his last dollar. Ha, ha! your syren smile drove him wild!"</p>
               <p>"If I were the pitiless wretch you represent me, I should have long age ceased to be human," replied. Gertrude, shuddering as her little hand adjusted her hood over her beautiful head. "Oh, Irwin! Irwin! why will you cling to this terrible life?"</p>
               <p>"Now, by heavens, I'll not endure this," he rejoined, angrily. "You are not such a pure, immaculate creature that I should permit you to preach morality to me; I tell you, Gert, I <emph>am</emph> a gambler by nature, I love it, 'tis my profession and <emph>yours.</emph>"</p>
               <p>She almost shrank from him as he said this, giving a low wail of despair that seemed to come from the innermost depths of her heart.</p>
               <p>The gambler laughed mockingly.</p>
               <p>"Irwin, you have robbed me of my peace of mind. I have deceived my mother, how can I ever dare tell her the truth!"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you wish me to do it for you," said the gambler, sneeringly. "It will soon pluck my pretty bird of her handsome feathers."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Hush!</emph>" interrupted Gertrude, half alarmed as she observed my tall form; "who is <emph>that</emph>? Good God! it is Mr. Copples!"</p>
               <p>She staggered and would have fallen, but I sprang forward and caught her.</p>
               <p>"Confound your officiousness," ejaculated the gambler fiercely. "Let that woman alone."</p>
               <p>"I will take her home, if you please," I said firmly.</p>
               <p>He grew black with jealous rage as he almost snatched Gertrude away from me.</p>
               <p>"Do you know, meddlesome fool, she is <emph>my wife.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Your wife!</emph>" I exclaimed, scarcely able to repress my astonishment. I looked inquiringly towards Gertrude—a deep blush suffused her lovely face.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Copples, it is true," she gasped. "For Heaven's sake," she added pleadingly, "do not mention this unfortunate meeting to any one."</p>
               <p>"You may command me, Miss Mellows," I replied calmly.</p>
               <p>Gertrude would have spoken again, but her husband rudely pulled her away; as she turned to follow him she gave me a tender glance of gratitude.</p>
               <p>I watched the couple as they disappeared from view, surprised and shocked by the startling discovery I had made. The mystery that had plagued me was now over—the doubts that worried me were dispelled; alas! now I understood the secret of the handsome furniture, the beautiful paintings, the appliances of wealth that graced Mrs. Mellows' house. A gambler's wife—and worse still, the involuntary means of wringing money from his slavish dupes. Even with the consciousness of the young girl's degradation I mentally acknowledged her fascination over me was complete—my tongue was tied, my lips sealed. I would not have exposed her for millions of untold gold.</p>
               <p>When my weary watch was over I gladly returned to my lodgings to snatch an interval<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC5830-00000055"/> val of repose, but I could not sleep; my mind busied itself over the events of the night, and the sweet face of Gertrude haunted me with that eloquent, grateful glance.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mellows noticed my haggard face the next morning at the breakfast table, and spoke of it before the imperturbable Mr. Jangle, who uttered a most expressive "humph!" which correctly implied policemen to be metropolitan humbugs.</p>
               <p>I dreaded meeting Gertrude; whenever the door opened in anticipation of her entrance, I grew strangely agitated, which good Mrs. Mellows observing, attributed to the chills, and warmly recommended as an infallible cure, a certain kind of bitters, the name of which she couldn't distinctly remember, though she was positive it was either the "Bodkin" or the "Podkin bitters," finally concluding "it wasn't bitters at all," but an acid medicine sold at the surprisingly low figure of 25 cents per bottle.</p>
               <p>We had relays of hot cakes constantly on hand, keeping Mr. Jangle in jealous watchfulness lest the relays should get ahead of him, until his appetite declined, when he grew despondent over the comet and relapsed into a brown study.</p>
               <p>I took advantage of a lull in the conversation to leave the breakfast table, and steal in the parlor to gaze again on the counterfeit Miss Mellows, always smiling so cheerfully over the mantel piece, unconscious a form had followed me—a slight touch on the shoulder and I turned to recognize Gertrude. She looked pale, even weary, with traces of great mental distress plainly observable on her lovely features.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Mr. Copples," she said, hesitatingly extending her jewelled little hand. "As you know me now, I scarcely dare hope you will accept the hand of such a wicked creature as myself."</p>
               <p>"Miss Gertrude, pardon me, Madam—"</p>
               <p>"No, no," she interposed, shaking her curls sadly. "Call me Gertrude still."</p>
               <p>"Believe me, Miss Gertrude," I rejoined feelingly, as I retained her hand in mine. "Whatever I may unfortunately know of you makes no alteration in my sentiments of respect and good will; your secret is safe with me."</p>
               <p>"Noble friend, I believe you," she returned in an agitated tone. "Oh, sir, I am a poor sinful creature. Do not utterly condemn me; or believe me so vile and unprincipled that I cannot appreciate your friendship though I may not deserve it. Pity me!"</p>
               <p>"I do. I do."</p>
               <p>"I have been anxious to see you," she pursued in a faint, tremulous voice, "to explain the circumstances under which you met me last evening. I am, as you divined, the wife of a gambler, a cold, heartless, selfish man who may love me in his way, but who cannot boast of possessing a tithe of my poor heart. My love lies buried in the grave. Oh, sir, if you can imagine me once a pure, guileless creature, whom a kind, loving parent suffered not the winds of heaven to visit too roughly, and contrast me with the worthless thing I am now, you would pity me indeed—"</p>
               <p>For a moment Gertrude seemed overcome, then she proceeded faintly, almost in a whisper:</p>
               <p>"Three years ago, Mr. Copples, when not quite fifteen I was lured by the flattery of a designing woman, to venture on the stage as a dancer. I little dreamt of the danger that menaced me, but happily I was in love with one who steeled my heart against temptation. Alfred Layton was an artist, a man whose noble qualities of head and heart were united with great gifts. Yonder picture attests his genius. I loved him passionately, madly—we were engaged, but were never destined to be married. One night Alfred was struck down by the cruel bullet of an assassin; he never lived to breathe his murderer's name. I did not suspect then that the cowardly wretch was to be my future husband, <emph>Irwin Dessel!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Miss Gertrude."</p>
               <p>"It is true," she continued with dilating eye and heaving bosom. "Irwin was an unsuccessful suitor for my hand when Alfred was visiting our house; he was jealous and I have reason to believe he killed him in order to obtain me. In my grief I vowed I would never marry. Irwin was importunate—he represented he was wealthy and for a mother's sake I blindly consented to a secret marriage; then came the terrible denouement. I discovered my husband was a professional gambler; nay more, he taunted me with it; threatened to divulge to mother the brand of ignominy resting upon me; rather than she should know it I consented to become the partner of his infamy. He parades me before the denizens of that vile place, while I am the gilded bait that tempts young men to risk their all, rob their employers, and die cursing the day that gave them birth!"</p>
               <p>"How can he pretend to love you and treat you so shamefully?"</p>
               <p>"His mind is too coarse to call it cruelty," she rejoined, sighing; "oh, my friend, are you surprised to know I am the most miserable of women, doomed to a life of vice; shunned by my own sex; conscious that I am a living cheat, and worse still, deceiving that dear mother who thinks me perfection?"</p>
               <p>Gertrude covered her face and wept bitterly. I drew her gently to the sofa and took a seat by her side.</p>
               <p>"Will you permit me to advise you?" I asked with respectful earnestness.</p>
               <p>"I am not worthy," murmured Gertrude, her lustrous eyes flashing through her tears a swift, grateful glance.</p>
               <p>"Leave that man."</p>
               <p>"I dare not," replied Gertrude, shuddering; "oh, I dare not. He has threatened to expose me; he will do it; I haven't the courage to let poor mother know the extent of my deception; it would turn her mad with grief."</p>
               <p>Let me be the mediator," I urged. "I can by degrees prepare her."</p>
               <p>"No, Mr. Copples," cried Gertrude, wildly; "you must not breath a word of this to her. It would break her heart; remember the strong faith, the almost childlike trust she has in me; she would scorn me, hate me, drive me from her!"</p>
               <p>"She would consider," argued I, "that you had been drawn in the net by your devotion to her; she would forgive the deception on that very account."</p>
               <p>"Even if it could be so," replied Gertrude, shaking her head sorrowfully, "I have still reasons to dread Irwin's vengeance. To humor me, he keeps my secret and permits me to live here."</p>
               <p>"But at such a dreadful sacrifice," I added; "Miss Gertrude, are you unwilling to yield these gilded trappings of wealth even for honor's sake?"</p>
               <p>"You think me like the rest of the world—selfish and mercenary," rejoined Gertrude, sadly; "but I care nothing for myself, everything for mother; she is unfitted to wrestle with the world; she never knew what it was to want until father died; I made a vow to keep her from poverty's degradation, and that pledge I cannot break."</p>
               <p>"I am afraid, Miss Gertrude, my advice will then prove of little service to you," I said seriously.</p>
               <p>"Dear friend, do not be angry with me," she replied, vehemently; "do not be hasty in judging Miss Gertrude; I am weak and foolish; pray for me and I will try and be a good girl."</p>
               <p>She seized my hand, pressed it reverentially to her lips, and turned away.</p>
               <p>"Miss Gertrude!" I involuntarily exclaimed.</p>
               <p>But the parlor door closed. I was left alone with the musical ticking French clock, and the sweet Tyrolese peasant, smiling upon me half sadly, as though conscious I had turned over a new leaf in my uneventful life.</p>
               <milestone n="* * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>I had been two months at Mrs. Mellows', and this brief lapse of time made me feel perfectly at home. Mr. Jangle had worked very hard on the prediction, and with a gloomy frown admitted to me confidentially that the prediction was lengthening.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mellows, amiable creature, was in a great flow of animal spirits, especially since the departure of Jane, who, having broken Gertrude's favorite vase, had gone into exile in consequence.</p>
               <p>On the whole, for a quiet family party we all got along very well together. As for Gertrude, I seldom had an opportunity of meeting her, except at the table; I could plainly see she studiously avoided me. It pained me also to observe she was growing very thin and pale.</p>
               <p>On my solitary night beat I often observed her accompanied by her husband, wearily threading her way through the deserted streets; but though frequently near enough to brush against me the folds of her cloak, she gave no signs of recognition. Dessel, on the contrary, invariably greeted me with a scowl; I instinctively knew the man hated me, and I reciprocated his strong dislike, hardly conscious it was intensified by our casual meeting; Gertrude's sad, sweet face haunted me everywhere. I was filled with a strange solicitude for this beautiful and unfortunate woman, and anxiously watched her at the table, hoping for some explanation of her altered behavior; but beyond a careless "good day" or indifferent observation, none came.</p>
               <p>It was easy to see she clung to the man and his evil course through fear; he held her in obeyance with threats which she<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC5830-00000056"/> seemed to dread more than the vicious life she led.</p>
               <p>The grape vines in the arbor withered and the rich clusters of fruit disappeared. The autumnal winds sent the dying leaves eddying in the windows of my chamber as I sat there one afternoon in gloomy reverie.</p>
               <p>A soft tap on the door aroused me from my reflections. It was partly ajar, a quick throb of pleasure came to my heart as I recognized the graceful outlines of Gertrude's figure. I rose and offered my hand; she was flushed and agitated; I knew at once something unusual had occurred.</p>
               <p>"Dear friend," she said, tremulously, "what I have been long dreading has at length come. Irwin insists that I must leave mother and live with him. Is it not a terrible alternative?"</p>
               <p>"Now is your time," I eagerly returned, "to throw him off. If he is the villain you have pictured him to me, why do you still remain where he is? Why do you encourage his unprincipled life?"</p>
               <p>She uttered a low cry and clung beseechingly to me.</p>
               <p>"Do not say more. I know it all. Oh, I wish I were dead!"</p>
               <p>"Calm yourself, Miss Gertrude."</p>
               <p>"How can I be calm when my heart is tempest-tossed, almost wrecked?" she replied wildly. "Irwin has lately grown very dissipated; he has lost money at the gaming table and it makes him more reckless than ever; added to this he has become very jealous of you."</p>
               <p>"Jealous of <emph>me</emph>," I repeated, with a strange tremor.</p>
               <p>"Yes, fearfully jealous of you. He has hired spies to dog and watch me while I am here, and I have scarcely dared to look at you; he twits me with meeting you by stealth, and is abusive, even violent at times."</p>
               <p>"I can testify to him and the world you are the purest of the pure."</p>
               <p>"Dear friend," rejoined Gertrude, smiling through her tears, "I was not mistaken in supposing your face mirrored a noble heart. I thank God for your friendship, though I fear it will not avert my fate."</p>
               <p>"Have you, then, resolved to obey him?" I asked compassionately. "Do you really intend leaving your poor mother and following the fortunes of this evil man?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," she murmured huskily, "I cannot do otherwise. Irwin holds my fate in his hands. Although you may think me weak and foolish, do not believe me utterly devoid of feeling; I do not intend, nor ever shall abandon her; she must never know I am a gambler's wife; she must never know what a sinful creature I have been, and how wickedly I have deceived her. Farewell, kind friend, you will always be cherished in affectionate remembrance by Gertrude."</p>
               <p>She seized my hand convulsively; a hot, burning tear, fell upon it.</p>
               <p>"You will keep my secret," she added in a hurried whisper. "I leave immediately; a letter to my mother will explain my departure."</p>
               <p>I silently bowed my head, and then, with a strong effort to check her emotions, Gertrude hastily left my presence.</p>
               <p>In a moment more I heard the hall door open and shut. Gertrude Mellows was gone; a strange sense of loneliness crept over me, a desolation which seemed to clothe the house in a pall of gloom; the question that had so often tortured my heart and which I scarcely dared utter to myself, was now answered. I knew I loved Gertrude with an intensity of passion I had never felt for her sex before.</p>
               <p>At the supper table I was a guilty wretch, indeed, when Mrs. Mellows inquired the state of my health, and, observing my slim appetite, kindly insisted upon preparing a plate of toast, especially for my accommodation.</p>
               <p>Poor Mrs. Mellows had never seemed more cheerful and happy; she addressed herself by turns to Mr. Jangle and myself in a rambling discursive vein on various topics, ending with a historical reminiscence of a famous family cat, of extensive vitality, who she was prepared to aver from her grandmother's recollections had been slain no loss than a dozen times by mischievous boys, invariably turning up after each martyrdom safe and sound, to the no small astonishment and confusion of its persecutors.</p>
               <p>Having thus triumphantly proved the accuracy of the saying that "a cat has nine lives," Mrs. Mellows proceeded to draw a comparison between cats and rabbits which French cooks usually served up in such ingenious and palatable styles as to render it clearly impossible to distinguish the difference.</p>
               <p>When Mrs. Mellows had rattled on for some time she gave an uneasy glance at the clock and wondered at the prolonged absence of Gertrude.</p>
               <p>I almost feared she would interrogate me, but she did not, constantly running to the window and eagerly scanning every female figure that loomed through the fast-gathering darkness.</p>
               <p>I pitied poor Mrs. Mellows from the bottom of my heart, but dared not stay longer lest my sad tell-tale face might awaken suspicion, so I hurried on my overcoat and descended to the street.</p>
               <p>Rain had commenced falling, and shop awnings and umbrellas were dripping sympathetically in dismal unison. The weather suited my feelings, for I was oppressed with a deep melancholy, nay, a strange presentiment of evil seemed to overshadow me, which I could not shake off.</p>
               <p>When I resumed my lonely night vigil the storm had visibly increased, and as the night were on, the wind swept in fitful gusts through the streets, while the rain came pouring down in torrents. Seeking temporary refuge under an awning, I stood shaking the wet from my streaming garments, when two other persons whom I could just distinguish from their dress to he a man and woman, sought shelter from the driving storm, a few paces from where I stood.</p>
               <p>"Curses on the rain," growled the man angrily, "I'm wet through."</p>
               <p>I started; the voice was Irwin Dessel's, and he was evidently laboring under some deep excitement, for after a momentary pause he continued:</p>
               <p>"Gert—do you hear—I'm a ruined man, a beggar. I staked my last dollar this very night."</p>
               <p>"Irwin, Irwin, you will break my heart."</p>
               <p>"I have one alternative," pursued the gambler hoarsely, "your mother must give up her furniture; it is rich and costly, and will fetch a handsome sum at auction."</p>
               <p>"I will not consent to that," replied Gertrude firmly; "besides, you know it was made over to her in a legal way; you cannot touch it."</p>
               <p>"I was a fool to do it," retorted the gambler, "but you dare not refuse to give me the furniture. You have not surely forgotten my threat? I mean to fulfil the promise to the letter; I will expose you to the world. That darling mother shall know the extent of her daughter's infamy."</p>
               <p>"Irwin, would you so basely betray my secret? Has this mad thirst for gaming driven away every sense of honor?"</p>
               <p>"Don't talk to me of honor," rejoined Dessel, moodily. "I want money and I must have it. Once more I ask you, will you sell the furniture?"</p>
               <p>"I will not beggar mother to pamper your selfish appetites," said Gertrude, warmly. "You may have everything belonging to me—my dresses and jewelry—but mother's property must remain untouched."</p>
               <p>Gertrude spoke this firmly and in a measured tone of voice quite unlike herself.</p>
               <p>It seemed to inflame the gambler to madness, for with a fierce imprecation he struck Gertrude heavily in the face.</p>
               <p>It was not so dark but that I could detect the devilish expression in Dossel's features; I thought it was quite time to interfere, and as he raised his arm a second time, I quickly caught it and averted the blow.</p>
               <p>"You are treating Mrs. Dessel with unnecessary cruelty," I said, as he turned fiercely upon me.</p>
               <p>"How dare you  meddle between husband and wife?" he demanded through his clenched teeth, as he recognized me.</p>
               <p>"I have a right as an officer of the Metropolitan police to protect her from violence," I replied quietly.</p>
               <p>He stood with bated breath glaring at me through the gloom, then with a cry of wrath, he spat in my face and rushed upon me like a roused tiger.</p>
               <p>In a moment we were locked in each other's strong grip in fierce and deadly conflict. He was a powerful built man, lithe as an Indian, and for a time we struggled unavailingly; but I managed at last to get my club arm free, and dealt him a stunning blow on the head. Tottering backward, Dessel drew a revolver and fired.</p>
               <p>Gertrude had impulsively rushed between us, and as the sharp report of the pistol rang on the air, she uttered a cry of pain, and staggered into my arms. Simultaneous with this murderous shot my own revolver was out, and as Dessel turned to fly, a ball went crashing through his brain. With a fearful yell the gambler threw up his arms, and fell dead at my feet.</p>
               <p>I tenderly bore the wounded and senseless girl into a neighboring coffee-house; blood was flowing from a dangerous wound in her breast, and it was evident life was ebbing fast.</p>
               <p>As I bent over her and staunched the crimson stream, she returned to consciousness<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC5830-00000057"/> ness, but her glorious eyes were already dimmed with coming death.</p>
               <p>"Lift me up," she murmured faintly; then as I gently raised her head she cast upon me an imploring look, and feebly whispered, "Don't let poor mother suffer, don't forsake her."</p>
               <p>I knelt down beside Gertrude and promised to be a true and faithful friend to that mother, and, come what might, never to desert her.</p>
               <p>A light flitted over the features of the dying girl, a light of unwonted beauty, of tender, loving trust; the lips parted to speak, but only smiled and spoke no more.</p>
               <milestone n="* * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>The following morning I broke the terrible news gently as possible to Mrs. Mellows. I concealed from her all the attendant circumstances of her daughter's untimely and tragical end. I told her that Gertrude had died speaking of her and loving her still. I spoke soothingly and compassionately, while the poor bereaved creature clung to me as though waking from some awful dream. She did not scream or cry, nor even groan, but kept her arms clasped tightly round my neck, and when I gently released them she groped around like one who was blind and had lost all sense of identity or existence.</p>
               <p>When Gertrude's inanimate form came back to the house in a rosewood casket, with flowers strewn around it, the poor mother did not seem to recognize her, but spoke smilingly of her own daughter who was away and would return very soon.</p>
               <p>After the funeral services were over, Mr. Jangle and myself gently led her to take a last look at that sad, beautiful face, lovely even in death; the mother's reason appeared to return, for she wept softly, and appealed to us all if <emph>her</emph> Gertrude had not always been "a dutiful daughter and <emph>so good</emph>."</p>
               <p>We were much affected and even Mr. Jangle himself was observed to use the corner of his bandanna to his left eye, and frown very hard at the ceiling with his right, as though the prediction had arrived unexpectedly and taken him by surprise.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mellows never recovered completely from the shock, but she was child-like and docile. I easily induced her to relinquish the house in Macdougal street and move into loss pretentious apartments in St. Mark's Place. Mr. Jangle concluded to accompany us, and assiduously devoted himself to the "prediction" with his accustomed ardor and perseverance.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mellows exhibits great pleasure in arranging the furniture, discoursing in her voluble, cheerful way, and seems to wonder at my solemn face and the tears that flow unbidden when she recounts, in plaintive accents, the oft told tale of maternal devotion and a daughter's love.</p>
