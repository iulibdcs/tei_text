               <head>STORY OF ABIDAH,</head>
               <head type="sub">PRINCE OF THIBET.</head>
               <p>ABIDAH was the son of the king of Thibet, whose residence was at Lassa, the capital of the country. He was his father's only child, and much beloved by him; and great pains had been taken with his education, to render him fit for the high position he was one day to occupy. The person to whom his instruction was principally assigned was Sind, a man of great learning, and possessed of a mingled gravity and amiability calculated to render him both respected and beloved by his pupils. The young prince, who had just reached manhood, was intelligent and sprightly, though somewhat impetuous in his disposition; and had derived much advantage from the lessons of his faithful instructor. Every rational means of enjoyment was afforded to him by his indulgent father, who was now advanced in age; and he had the prospect before him of ascending a throne at no distant day, and ruling over a flourishing kingdom. But though he was in many respects an affectionate and dutiful<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC5973-00000004"/> son, yet he was impatient of the necessary restraints with which he was surrounded, and longed to mingle in scenes of adventure, where he might be his own master and carve out his own fortune. His worthy friend Sind often reproved him for these signs of restlessness and discontent, telling him he should be satisfied with the position in which Providence had placed him—a position certainly most fortunate, and which few persons were ever so lucky as to enjoy; that in a few years his father would be removed from the earth, and that he would then succeed him in the kingdom, and be master not only of himself but of a whole empire. To this the young man would reply by telling his preceptor that he entirely misunderstood him: that it was not by any means that he longed to wield the scepter that he felt his situation to be irksome; for that he would as willingly lead the life of a private individual as that of a king; but he grieved that his father, for reasons of state and consideration for his safety, kept him at home, giving him no chance of seeing the world and learning to depend on his own resources.</p>
               <p>"Yes," continued he, "why could I not, my dear friend, with my youth and energy, to say nothing of the acquirements your excellent lessons have imparted to me—why could not I, as so many others have done, start out in the world, and do something for myself? Why could I not attain some noble fortune, perform some great achievement, or even found an empire, leaving a name in history worthy of being applauded, instead of being the mere recipient of benefits secured by the labour of those who have preceded me. This mode of life I think you must admit yourself would be far more honourable and praiseworthy than the tame, dull position I now occupy."</p>
               <p>"The sentiments you express and the spirit you evince are certainly laudable," answered Sind; "but you do not, in my opinion, view the matter correctly in all its bearings. You require Providence, as it seems to me, to be too profuse in its gifts—to join two destinies in one individual: you succeed to a throne; you wish also to found one; you are the heir of a high fortune; you desire also to achieve one; you cannot be two things at once; you cannot have the strength of the elephant and the swiftness of the antelope. Your lot in life is plainly marked out: you are born the heir of a kingdom; strive to fulfil your duty as you ought, be satisfied with your happy condition, and aspire not after pursuits which, though commendable in others, would to you be unnecessary and out of place."</p>
               <p> Thus did Sind endeavour to correct the discontent of his young friend, but his wise counsels had little effect on Abidah, who continually intreated his father to allow him to leave home, and push his fortune in the world.</p>
               <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC5973-00000005"/>
               <p>"My dear son," the king would reply, "you have no fortune to push—your fortune is already made; why not sit down and enjoy yourself, instead of encountering risks and inconveniences totally unnecessary? Choose among the ladies of my court some one as your wife, and settle yourself down for life: you shall have an establishment and retinue suitable to your rank, and in due time will be my successor and rule over a flourishing kingdom."</p>
               <p>"You are kind and beneficent," answered the prince, "and lavish your bounties like a great monarch; but I would prefer myself to be independent, and receive bounty from no one. You have given me a good education, instructed me in every branch of learning, and especially in the military art: why, then, should I not show the fruit of these accomplishments? why should I not start out on some career of great deeds, enter into the service of some mighty prince—the sultan of India, for example—make myself useful and necessary to him, fight his battles, become a great conqueror, marry his daughter, and then return loaded with riches and honours? What glory would not this confer on your family, and what power to your empire?"</p>
               <p>The old king smiled at seeing his son give way to these day-dreams, for as such he looked upon them; and ended by telling him that he might have his own way, though he greatly feared that things would not turn out exactly as he fancied. He told him that he might set out as soon as he pleased on his adventures—that he would furnish him with ample means; but advised him to take his tutor Sind along, as his wisdom and experience might be of great use to him, and, to say the least, could do him no harm. In this Abidah acquiesced, thanking his father for his goodness; and in a few days arrangements were made for their departure.</p>
               <p>They were furnished with jewels and money, and one fine morning, just at day-break, after bidding the old king farewell, they set out on their journey. Abidah felt in high spirits, as he passed through the gate of the city; every thing seemed to smile upon him, and he doubted not but he should return at no distant day with his hopes fully realized.</p>
               <p>They traveled several days without meeting with any thing worthy of notice, discoursing very pleasantly as they went along, and discussing almost every subject that ever entered into the human mind; for they were both of a philosophical turn, and, as we said before, well instructed in every branch of learning. At night they stopped at the villages which lay on their route, and generally met with hospitable treatment from the country people, which they munificently repaid with the ample means they carried with them.</p>
               <p>On the fourth day they came in sight of a range of mountains, which Sind told his companion was<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC5973-00000006"/> the boundary that divided Thibet from India, and they pushed forward in order to reach the foot of them before nightfall. The prospect of their blue outline roused Abidah's enthusiasm, and he longed to cross them and enter on the new and bright world which he imagined lay beyond. Late in the afternoon they reached the slopes, and with much fatigue began to climb the woody path, intending to rest at a small dwelling which they understood was situated some distance up the ascent, and which was the last place where they would meet with any inhabitants until they arrived at the other side. They toiled onward in silence among steep precipices and shady ravines, and now heard the tinkling of a bell and, seeing some goats, they followed them, and in a little while came to a small cottage, overshadowed with dark pines. The gloom of evening had now overspread the scene, and, owing to the elevation they had reached, the air was quite cold, so that the travelers were very glad to arrive at a place of shelter. They knocked at the entrance, which was partly opened by an old woman, who showed her dried and wrinkled face, and then hastily shut the door. A low conversation was then heard inside, whereupon the old lady peeped out, and the strangers were asked what they wanted.</p>
               <p>"We are travelers," answered Abidah, "crossing the mountains, and being overtaken by night are compelled to ask for food and shelter. If you will grant us this, we will be truly grateful, and amply repay you for the trouble we may put you to."</p>
               <p>The woman nodded assent, and bid the strangers enter. The interior of the cottage, though simple and rough, was quite comfortable; and a blazing fire in a large chimney imparted an agreeable and cheerful aspect. By the side of the fire was seated an old man, smoking; his hair and beard were white as snow, and he appeared to be of great age, yet still hale and hearty. He nodded to his guests, and pointed them to take their seats on a couple of stools, whilst his wife busied herself preparing supper. In a little while a repast was served up to them on a rough board table. It consisted of goat's milk and cheese, butter, brown bread and chestnuts. This was a frugal meal compared with what Abidah had been accustomed to; but the long walk had sharpened his appetite, and both he and his companion did ample justice to it. Meanwhile the old woman waited on her guests, her tongue all the time running, and putting a thousand questions to the travelers.</p>
               <p>Having finished their supper, they again seated themselves by the fire, wondering at the silence of the husband, who had not uttered a word, so that they began to look upon him as a crabbed, morose sort of person; but in this they were mistaken, as he now showed himself garrulous enough; for having replenished his pipe, and bid his wife to<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC5973-00000007"/> cease questioning the gentlemen, he began relating his history, and how he came to inhabit such a solitary dwelling. He told them that he was a hunter, and was well acquainted with every foot of the mountains for leagues round, and related to them many adventures he had had while pursuing the business, and of his encounters with lions, panthers, bears, and wolves, and of his hair-breadth escapes, some of which were so marvellous as to strike Abidah and his companion with wonder.</p>
               <p>"But the strangest adventure," continued he, "was one that I once had among the Black rocks many years ago, and which to this very day I cannot account for, scarcely knowing whether to look upon it as a reality or a dream."</p>
               <p>"It's no dream at all," said the old woman; "but true enough, every word of it; and you must by all means relate it to the gentlemen."</p>
               <p>"It is somewhat long," answered the husband, "but if our guests would like to listen to it, I will tell it willingly; for it's as well remembered by me as if it happened yesterday."</p>
               <p>The travelers replied that nothing would give them more pleasure than to hear the story, whereupon the fire was replenished, and the old lady lighting a pipe and drawing her stool close to her husband, the latter without further preface thus began:</p>
               <p>"'Tis some sixty years since, when I was a young man, that I was one time out hunting, which, as I said, was my occupation. I was successful in my labours, and succeeded in killing a number of animals, and getting some valuable skins. In the course of my rambles, I had crossed the summit of the mountains, and got some distance down on the other side; so I concluded that I would proceed to one of the nearest cities, and endeavour to dispose of my furs. I descended into the plain, and entered a town of India, where I sold my goods at a high price; and, putting my money in a bag, turned very joyfully towards home. I climbed the mountain again, and having crossed the ridge, was coming down on this side, and had reached a spot called the Black rocks, which is a kind of table-land a league distant from here, strewn over with blocks of ironstone of every size and form. I threaded my way as well as I could through this stony wilderness, hoping soon to get clear of it, when I was suddenly roused by the sound of loud groans, and looking about to discover whence they proceeded, I at last discovered a man lying in one of the crevices, apparently in great distress. I hurried to his relief, and, stooping down, begged him to tell me who he was, and what ailed him. 'I'm an India merchant,' replied he, 'just returning from Thibet; and on my way back to my own country, was attacked by thieves, who robbed me of my money, and after beating me severely, cast me into this gully, in<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC5973-00000008"/> which I am wedged so tight that I cannot get out.' I took hold of him, and raised him on his feet, for which he kindly thanked me, at the same time asking if I could spare him a small sum to carry him home. I took out the bag of silver from my bosom, and handed it to him. 'Here, my good friend,' said I, 'take this; you live a great way off, and have a long journey before you: you will need it to defray your expenses; a league or two more will bring me home, and another good hunt will make up my loss.' He would not at first accept the gift, but I insisted on it; and we soon after parted with mutual good wishes, he telling me that I had acted like a prince, and that he hoped some day a prince would reward me.</p>
               <p>"As it was now pretty late, and I was still some distance from home, the evening too being pleasant, I resolved to remain where I was till morning, and accordingly gathering some branches of pine, I strewed them upon a rock and laid down to sleep, feeling very happy for the good deed I had performed. I lay there some time, but cannot tell how long, when I was startled by the appearance of a man of gigantic size, who rose from among the stones, and stood before me. 'Rustan,' said he, (for such is my name,) 'I am one of the genii who inhabit this abode, and was a witness of the charitable feeling you displayed toward the poor merchant. Your good deed will not go unrecompensed; like a prince you acted, and by a prince you'll be rewarded. Go to yonder tower, and knock at it three times: a door will open, and you will find treasures there you have no idea of.' I jumped up from my couch, but the figure had disappeared. I then went to the tower, which was a huge rock of great height rising amid the others, and which I had noticed in the afternoon for its singular appearance. I picked up a stone, and knocked against its side three times; when, sure enough, a door opened, and in the hall stood a black slave, who said, 'Rustan, you acted like a prince to-day, and by a prince you'll be rewarded; fear nothing, but ascend the stairs.' I accordingly mounted the steps for a long distance, and looking through a door which stood open, I saw a large company of people, elegantly dressed, sitting round a table feasting. At the head of the table sat a young man, magnificently attired, to whom all the others seemed to pay great deference. 'Now,' said I, 'my recompense is coming; these people are all nobles, and yonder is the prince who is to reward me.' I stood for some time waiting to be called in, yet no one took the least notice of me, but all went on eating and drinking, as though they saw me not. I waited till I was ashamed to stand there any longer, and turned on my heel to depart, when another black slave approached me. 'Rustan,' said he, 'you acted like a prince to-day, and by a prince you'll be rewarded; fear nothing, but<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC5973-00000009"/> ascend the stairs.' I accordingly proceeded as he bid me up another high flight; and at last, when quite tired, reached a room filled with crystal vases heaped with gold coin. I stared with wonder at the sight. 'Oh!' said I, 'if I could only get a handful of this money how happy should I be! It will not do to help myself without permission; but the prince will doubtless be here presently, and give me to my heart's content.' I waited a long time, but no prince appeared; and turning round to depart, another black slave stood behind me. 'Rustan,' said he, 'you acted like a prince to-day, and by a prince you'll be rewarded; fear nothing, but ascend the stairs.' I did as he bid me, and again began to mount; and after proceeding a great height, exhausted with fatigue, I came to another room. I looked in, and saw with astonishment rows of crystal vases filled with all kinds of precious stones, of such lustre and magnitude as fairly dazzled my eyes. 'Oh!' said I, 'if I could only get one of the smallest of these precious stones, how happy should I be! It will not do to help myself, but doubtless the prince will be here presently, and give me to my heart's content.' I waited a long time, but no prince appeared; and so sorely did I feel my disappointment that I cried with vexation. I then turned round, and saw another black slave standing by me. 'Rustan,' said he, 'you acted like a prince to-day, and by a prince you'll be rewarded; fear nothing, but ascend the stairs.' 'No,' answered I, 'I'll ascend no more stairs: I've ascended already till my poor knees are giving way, and have gained nothing by it except being tantalized.' So saying I turned on my heel, and descended the tower much faster than I went up, and with my temper no wise improved by the journey. I came out of the door, and went back to my bed, cursing bitterly all genii and princes. I slept soundly, and was awaked by the rays of the sun falling on my face; whereupon I rose up and rubbed my eyes, meditating on the strange events of the night, not knowing whether it were a reality or a mere dream.</p>
               <p>"I went straight to the tall rock, which indeed very much resembled a tower, and walked round it, but could see no sign of a door or any thing like one; then I returned home, and related the adventure to my wife, who told me what a fool I was in coming away so soon; for, if she had been me, she would have gone on ascending the stairs even to the clouds, if it were only to see what the other rooms contained.</p>
               <p>"Many years passed away, yet my reward never came. Often when business called me to the plains, have I seated myself for hours on the steps of some palace or noble mansion, expecting that the door would open, and that the prince who inhabited it would come out and present me with some rare gift; but nothing of the kind ever occurred; so that I<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC5973-00000010"/> have begun to grow somewhat ill-natured, and hesitated to-day in giving you gentlemen admittance; for it seems to me that charitable deeds are all thrown away, and never rewarded."</p>
               <p>"Say not so," said Abidah, who, as well as Sind, had listened with wonder at the strange narrative; "say not so: your prince has arrived at last, and here is your reward:" whereupon he drew from his bosom a purse of gold, and placed it in the old man's lap. Both he and his wife were so overpowered with astonishment as to be unable to speak.</p>
               <p>"My good friends," said Sind, "be not amazed at what you see and hear: this young man is indeed a real prince, and well able to dispense bounties. Your story is certainly extraordinary, and whether it be a dream or reality, the coincidence by which it is now fulfilled is remarkable."</p>
               <p>"It shows," continued the prince, "that benefits conferred on others are never thrown away; and that good actions are generally rewarded, though the reward may be deferred for a long period."</p>
               <p>By this time the old couple had somewhat recovered their composure, and returned abundant and heartfelt thanks to Abidah for his goodness; the wife saying that she always thought what the genii promised would come true some day or other; though she was much mistaken in one thing, as she always believed that princes wore crowns, and never traveled but in a coach and six at least. Her guests smiled, and said that such was the usual custom; but that now they were journeying to see the country and gain instruction, intending to mingle with all classes of people; and that in such a case it would not do to travel in any pomp or splendor. To this the old lady assented, and as it was now growing late and her guests showed signs of drowsiness, she led them up to a sort of loft, the floor of which was strewn with sheep skins, on which they threw themselves, and slept comfortably till morning.</p>
               <p>They were awakened by the bright rays of the sun streaming through the openings of the hut, and on descending found a plentiful breakfast ready prepared for them; on partaking of which, they got directions as to their route, and, bidding their kind hosts farewell, they started on their journey.</p>
               <p>After proceeding a few miles, they came to the Black rocks, and perceived at a distance the tower which had been the scene of the old man's adventure. It was a tall square block, rising high above the rest, and though it lay somewhat off from their track, Abidah insisted on going to look at it. He walked several times round it, and knocked thrice, calling upon the genii to open the door. His tutor smiled at seeing him do so, and told him they had best not loiter too much, but proceed on their journey, as it was a long way yet to the top of the mountain. Continuing thus, they began to perceive here and there patches of snow, and the air grew quite cold.<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC5973-00000011"/> All signs of vegetation now ceased, except mosses and lichens, and the snow gradually increased, so that they often sunk ankle deep, and could walk but slowly. Toiling along with much fatigue, and winding among rocks and precipices, they at last reached the ridge of the mountain, and could look down on the other side. A beautiful prospect presented itself: before them lay what seemed a boundless plain, variegated with fields and woods and winding rivers, glittering in the bright sunshine; all overspread with a soft blue haze, owing to the great height from which they beheld it. They seated themselves on a rock, and gazed for a long while on the delightful scene.</p>
               <p>"Here," said Sind to his companion, "is the India to which your thoughts have so often aspired, and which is to be the scene of your future career."</p>
               <p>"Yes," answered the prince, "and it by no means falls short of my expectation; for such a magnificent prospect, I must confess, I never beheld. But come, we have rested long enough; let us begin to descend, and mingle with the happy people who inhabit this pleasant land."</p>
               <p>So saying, they rose up and began to descend; and, as the path was pretty good, they proceeded rapidly, and in a little while got clear of the region of snow. Still descending, and passing a rocky tract covered with low bushes, they entered a belt of pines; then their track lay through oaks and chestnut trees, and as they approached the plain, palms and other tropical plants gradually appeared, mingled with beautiful flowers shedding sweet odours.</p>
               <p>They now met many of the inhabitants, and passing through several villages, arrived towards evening at a town where they resolved to spend the night. Having procured lodgings at a caravansary, and refreshed themselves, they sallied out to look at the place, and, winding through several streets, came to a large mansion brilliantly lighted up, and from which issued sounds of music and festivity. It was the residence of the Rajah, who was giving an entertainment to his friends and the principal citizens of the town. Advancing to the door, and slipping a piece of gold into the hands of the porter, they readily gained admittance. The porter ushered them into the chief room, announcing them as a couple of merchants of great dignity and immense wealth; and they were invited by the Rajah to take a seat on the divan and partake of the festivities.</p>
               <p>The hall was bright with lights, and adorned with flowers, and the tables loaded with dainties, fruits, and wines. The apartment was filled with people, and when the feasting was concluded, black slaves entered, bringing pipes, sherbet, and coffee. A signal being given, a troop of dancing girls issued forth elegantly habited, who exhibited their lightly clad forms in various fantastic motions, keeping exact time to the soft music. This was followed by<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC5973-00000012"/> a pantomime, carried on by a number of actors curiously dressed, which seemed to afford great amusement to the spectators, though Abidah and Sind did not very well understand the drift of it. After the pantomime, a slim, strange-looking man, with a smiling, good-humoured face and sandy complexion, glided in. This the Rajah informed Abidah was Jok the juggler, a famous adept in his art, and who was known far and wide, traveling from one place to another, to exhibit his wonderful performances. He made a low bow to the audience, and having delivered a short speech, commenced showing his tricks, which were very various and numerous, and admirably performed. The guests were delighted with his dexterity, and none more so than Abidah, who, though he had seen many such exhibitions before, affirmed that he had never in his life witnessed any thing so good.</p>
               <p>He was pleased especially with the man's looks and good humor; and the idea struck him that if he could be engaged he would make an excellent attendant for them in their travels, as he knew the country thoroughly, and was familiar with the habits and customs of the people. This notion being approved of by Sind, he called the juggler to his side, when he had concluded the exhibition, and slipping some gold into his hand imparted to him his views. Jok at once acquiesced in them, and promised to meet the travelers at their lodgings early in the morning. It was now late, and Abidah and his companion having thanked the Rajah for his hospitality and for the pleasure they had enjoyed, bid him farewell, and proceeded to the caravansary.</p>
               <p>They rose early, and at the appointed time Jok punctually appeared, whereupon they imparted their designs to him more fully, telling him they were making a tour to Delhi; and without informing him of their real rank they intimated to him their ability to reward him handsomely, if he proved faithful and capable, which they had no doubt he would. The juggler replied, that he could say with confidence that no one knew the country better than himself, and that he would do his best to make himself useful.</p>
               <p>They then set out, their new companion entertaining them highly with his gay disposition, and telling them many amusing anecdotes of the Rajah and the various personages they met at the feast. Thus they pursued their journey, and at night reached the banks of a large river, where they determined to halt. Jok went to a cottage at some distance, and bought some food, which he cooked for supper; and after smoking, they lay down to repose on the soft grass beneath the shelter of some tall palm trees.</p>
               <p>They slept quietly for several hours, but about the middle of the night were suddenly roused by the sound of voices; and, starting up, found themselves surrounded by a group of armed men. The<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC5973-00000013"/> robbers, for such they were, told them that resistance was useless; that they intended to do them no bodily harm, but that they must accompany them. Finding themselves overpowered, the travelers suffered themselves to be led down to the beach, where a boat lay, in which they all embarked, and taking up the oars they pushed out into the stream.</p>
               <p>Abidah now felt his pockets, and discovered that his money and jewels were gone; this of course he expected, but he wondered what need the robbers had of their persons, and where they were taking them to. They proceeded down the stream in silence several miles, and then steering to the high bluffs on the opposite side pushed into an opening among the rocks. Here was a spacious cavern, entirely concealed from the river, having a dry rocky floor and lofty roof. It was but dimly lighted when they entered, but was immediately illuminated with numerous lamps, which were attached to the walls and columns of the abode. These columns were of spar, formed by nature, and ran from the ceiling to the floor. Around them hung the shields, spears, and swords of the robbers, and the light striking upon them presented a dazzling and beautiful appearance. The ground was spread with carpets and mats, and bales of goods and merchandize of all sorts were piled against the walls. The captives were now showed a corner in which to set themselves, and some food was offered to them, of which however they did not partake.</p>
               <p>In a little while another boat arrived, with some fresh captives, and the rest of the robbers, among whom was Pharazac, the captain of the band. He was a man of great size, with a thick black beard, and his arms clattered as he entered the apartment. He took his seat at a table, and ordered all the prisoners to be brought before him, taking down their names and inspecting them, as it was understood they were to be sold the next day, to a company of slave merchants, who were expected to come down the river. They were brought up to him one by one, and after giving a piercing glance at each, he questioned them, and desired to know their trades and occupations, in order that he might sell them more readily. Among the new ones were masons, carpenters, blacksmiths, and husbandmen. When Jok's turn came, he also was asked if he knew any useful art. He replied that he was a juggler, and could amuse people by the hour with his wonderful tricks, and that besides that, he considered himself no mean cook.</p>
               <p>"Both these," said Pharazac, "are excellent employments, especially the latter, for whatever other tastes we may have, none of us can do without eating."</p>
               <p>Sind came next, and informed the chief that he was by profession a tutor, and could teach all branches of learning.</p>
               <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC5973-00000014"/>
               <p>"I never had much learning myself," said the captain, "and have got along, so far, well enough without it; but some people, I know, set great store by it, so I suppose it has its uses."</p>
               <p>Abidah now came up and told the robber that he had no trade whatever; but that he was well instructed, having had a first rate education, and that he could speak six tongues at least.</p>
               <p>"Bless my heart," cried Pharazac, "what's the need of six tongues? One tongue, I think, is enough for any one, and few indeed can govern even that; but perhaps, young man, as you look strong and hearty, you will make a good worker; tell me, then, have you plenty of muscle, and firm joints?"</p>
               <p>As he said this, he took a grip of the prince's arm with his iron hand, and giving it a pull, caused the young man to roar with pain. At this Pharazac and his men burst out laughing, and even Sind and the juggler could not help joining in it.</p>
               <p>"Well, my good friends," continued the chief, addressing the captives, "make up your minds to-morrow to march, for I expect then the merchant will be along, and will hand you over to him, and whether you clatter to him with your six tongues, or juggle him out of his seven senses, it's all one to Pharazac."</p>
               <p>Abidah and his company now resumed their seats on the mat, and the robbers sat down to supper. A black female slave brought in huge joints of meat, and an abundance of wine. The party seemed to enjoy themselves, and as the liquor circulated, they grew quite merry and boisterous. Abidah gazed on the strange scene with much interest.</p>
               <p>"Truly," said he to his companion, "these fellows seem to enjoy themselves, and appear most happy."</p>
               <p>"Call it not happiness," replied Sind, "but rather madness; for happiness needs not the aid of wine and revelry to sustain it; neither can it be compassed by external things at all; its seat is in the heart; it is the gift of God, and is given only to those who deserve it."</p>
               <p>After drinking some time, Pharazac called Jok. "Come, Mr. Juggler," said he, "show us a specimen of your art, so that we may see whether you understand your business or not."</p>
               <p>In a moment the juggler was on his feet, and taking out his cups and balls, amused the company highly. After exhibiting a great number of tricks, he took a large goblet, and filling it with red wine, thus spoke:</p>
               <p>"You see, gentlemen," said he, "this liquor is quite dark. In a few moments I'll turn it white."</p>
               <p>"Can you really do that?" said the chief.</p>
               <p>"Indeed I can," answered Jok; "but in performing such a trick, I shall need a little of your assistance; let each of you then take a sip from the glass, for this is necessary to carry out the experiment."</p>
               <p>They did as he desired, and putting the goblet<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC5973-00000015"/> around, each tasted of the wine, and then handed it to Jok. In a few moments their heads began to droop, and they all fell back on the cushions fast asleep.</p>
               <p>"Now," said the juggler, addressing his companions, "now is our time. I slipped a potent drug into the wine, which, as you see, has put them into a profound sleep, from which they will hardly awaken until the morning. Let us get the boat ready and make our escape."</p>
               <p>The captives were overjoyed at hearing this, and putting some of the valuable goods into the boat, they prepared to push off.</p>
               <p>"Stop," said the juggler, "we must carry the negro cook along with us, or she will awaken her masters when we depart, and they will of course pursue us."</p>
               <p>They accordingly brought out the woman, and all having embarked they pushed off. They rowed some distance up the stream, and then landed, concealing the boat among the tall reeds and jungles which lined the shore. Jok now told his companions that they had best separate, and each pursue his route homeward as fast as possible; and having divided the articles they brought from the cavern as well as they could, the party disbanded, bidding one another farewell, and all thanking their deliverer for his successful efforts in their behalf.</p>
               <p>"And now," said Abidah, "what are we to do, for we are strangers in this region, and have no homes to go to? Are we not likely to be pursued and overtaken by the robbers?"</p>
               <p>"Not if you follow my advice," answered the juggler. "A day's journey from this is the Isle of Palms, a sacred spot, inhabited by three brahmins; these worthy men are friends of mine, and will afford us a secure shelter as long as we desire. We will abide with them till our enemies return from pursuing us, and when all danger of being recaptured is at an end, we will leisurely continue our journey to Delhi."</p>
               <p>The black cook whom they had brought along, begged also to accompany them, and as they were unwilling to set her adrift, and thought she might prove useful, they readily acquiesced. They accordingly pursued their route, following the bank of the river through a country rather thinly inhabited. They were unable to reach their place of destination that evening, and were compelled to encamp for the night beneath the shelter of some trees. By the aid of Jok and the cook, they were provided with a tolerable supper; and lying down on the grass they reposed comfortably till morning. The next day they proceeded on their journey, and about noon reached the Isle of Palms. The river here was pretty wide, but shallow, and with its clear water, presented a very pleasant prospect, the country rising into mountains at some distance on each side. A beautiful island, covered with palm trees, lay in<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC5973-00000016"/> the middle of the stream, and finding a small boat on the shore, they all embarked and paddled toward it. Having reached the bank, they stepped ashore. A smooth grassy sward spread before them, and Jok taking the lead, they passed under the shade of the trees, the trunks rising up like lofty columns to a great height. Proceeding about a mile, they came to a neat one story building, constructed of bamboo, and thatched with palm leaves. Close by, seated on the grass, sat three venerable-looking men. These were the brahmins; they received Jok very kindly, and were introduced by him to the rest of the company, whom they saluted cordially, beckoning them to take seats beside them. Pipes and coffee were now presented, and the juggler related to the brahmins all that had happened to him and his companions, especially their capture by the robbers, and their lucky escape, to which the old gentlemen listened with great interest. After some time dinner was announced, and they repaired inside the house. The interior was spacious, and neatly furnished, and the floor covered with mats. The viands were simple and abundant, consisting of milk, butter, bread and fruit, but no meat; for the brahmins, believing in the transmigration of souls, never kill any kind of animal, nor taste their flesh.</p>
               <p>Abidah and Sind were much pleased with their new acquaintances, who were men of learning and intelligence, and listened with pleasure to their conversation versation; for though they had the reputation of being holy characters, they were by no means strict nor severe in their deportment; but on the contrary, sociable and pleasant. Having finished their repast, they left the cottage, and again seated themselves on the grass. Abidah looked round with delight, enchanted with the beauty and tranquillity of the scene, and could not refrain from giving utterance to his feelings.</p>
               <p>"Venerable and happy men," said he, addressing the brahmins, "I envy not your good fortune, yet at the same time I cannot but admire it. Here, cut off from the cares and turmoil of the world, you spend your tranquil lives in this sacred spot, formed, as it seems, for study and meditation. The trunks of these stately trees rise up like the columns of some vast cathedral; the shady roof is so lofty as scarcely to be reached by the eye, and the rays of the sun which here and there penetrate it, fall upon the green sward beneath with a soft and mellowed lustre. The clear bright river glides along, and the ripple, with its never ceasing murmur, lulls the mind to repose. Yonder purple mountains in the distance are surely the gates of some enchanted land, if not of heaven; oh happy spot, happy men!"</p>
               <p>Thus did the youth give way to his enthusiasm at beholding the scene; but now loud cries were heard on the opposite shore, and the company, on hearing them, moved to the water's edge to ascertain the<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC5973-00000017"/> cause. On the other side of the river, standing on the very brink, was discovered a diminutive figure of a man calling for help, and waving with all his might what seemed his girdle or turban.</p>
               <p>"Pray who is that dwarf?" said Abidah, addressing his hosts, "and what does he want?"</p>
               <p>"It is none else," answered the elder brahmin, "than little Doulee; but what he wants I cannot imagine, though he is evidently in distress. Jok, take the boat and row over to him without delay."</p>
               <p>The juggler did as requested, and whilst the boat was crossing the stream, the brahmin proceeded to give the prince some account of the new character who was about to appear.</p>
               <p>"His name is Doulee," said the old gentleman, "but, from his diminutive stature, he is generally called little Doulee, though he is by no means little in his own estimation. He lives on yonder mountain, and calls himself a shepherd, keeping, I believe, some half dozen sheep and goats; but there is little of the shepherd's simplicity about him, for he is, without exception, one of the most busy, consequential creatures ever met with, as you will soon discover for yourself."</p>
               <p>By this time the boat had returned, and the new comer, with some difficulty, managed to step ashore. He was a strange looking personage, not much over three feet in height, and with one leg much shorter than the other; this, of course, made him limp considerably siderably, yet with the aid of a huge stick, which he called his crook, he bustled about as lively as any one; he was quite bald, had a cunning look, and the joys and sorrows of sixty years were screwed up in his wrinkled face.</p>
               <p>"Well, Doulee," said the brahmin, "so you have come to pay us a visit at last."</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied the dwarf, "you may well say at last, for the way Jok rowed the boat I hardly expected to get here at all."</p>
               <p>"I defy any one to row you," said the juggler. "You did not sit still a moment."</p>
               <p>"But pray tell us," continued the brahmin, "why you cried to us in such an unusual manner, and even now, if I mistake not, you seem somewhat agitated?"</p>
               <p>"And tell me who would not be agitated," returned the dwarf, "after running a dozen miles, with at least a hundred robbers at his heels."</p>
               <p>"Robbers!" exclaimed the company, "be quick and tell us what you mean."</p>
               <p>"No," replied the little man, "I'll not tell you till I smoke a pipe, for though I deny being agitated, yet I'm sadly out of breath, and need repose;" so saying he seated himself cross-legged on the ground, and the brahmins directed Jok to fetch the pipes. They were accordingly brought and handed first to little Doulee, who picked out the biggest, and commenced puffing and blowing at a prodigious<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC5973-00000018"/> rate, so that he was presently enveloped in such a cloud of smoke as to be scarcely visible.</p>
               <p>"Come, friend Doulee," said the brahmin, "we are all anxiously waiting to hear your news, for I assure you it interests us exceedingly."</p>
               <p>The dwarf now cleared his throat, and looking around with an air of much consequence, thus began:</p>
               <p>"Well, gentlemen, you must know that early this morning I had just unpenned my flocks, and was sitting quietly before my house, skimming milk; all at once I heard a dog bark, and looking up I saw friend Graybeard coming towards me as fast as his old legs could carry him. 'Dreadful news!' cried he, 'dreadful news—the robbers are coming!' I jumped up, upsetting the pan of milk, telling him not to be alarmed, and asking him where were the neighbours. Presently a few began to collect, and I advised at once what was to be done; but they were such a stupid, obstinate set, that I could do nothing with them. I told them they must first beat an alarm and raise the neighborhood. They said they had no drums to beat with. I told them they had kettles and pans, which would do just as well. They said they were all in use, and filled with milk. I told them then to scream and bellow as loud as they could; but no, that would not do; they still objected. They said the shepherds couldn't be collected any how, and if they could, they would be too scared to fight. I asked them if they were cowards. They said no; they disdained the name; they were somewhat timorous, but not cowards. I told them there was no need of being timorous, for if they acted on my plan, victory would be certain. They asked what my plan was. I told them it was very simple; that they had only to charge forward on the enemy, kill every man of them, cut them into mincemeat, and then chop off their heads. But no, that wouldn't do; they still objected. They said if the shepherds collected it would do no good, for the country was too rocky and uneven to muster in. I told them each man might muster by himself. But no, that would not do; they said the ground was unfit for a battle field, and that in charging forward they might tumble down the mountain. I told them they might charge backward; but no, that wouldn't do; they said they had no leader. I told them they were mistaken, for if no other were found, that I would be their leader."</p>
               <p>At this part of the dwarf's narrative, the whole company commenced tittering; but so engrossed was he with his story, that he did not observe it, and thus continued:</p>
               <p>"So, gentlemen, I shouldered my crook and put myself at their head; at that moment a horn sounded and a cry rose that the robbers were coming. I told my men not to be alarmed, but to stand their ground whilst I went and roused the shepherds. I<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC5973-00000019"/> descended the mountain with all my might, telling every one I met not to be alarmed; half way down was a deep creek; I was much puzzled how to cross it, but as good luck would have it, I found Yam, the giant, sitting on the bank; I informed him the robbers were coming, but told him not to be alarmed, but just help me across the ditch as quick as possible, for I was bound post-haste on an important errand; he kindly consented; then I ran to the river to tell the news to my good friends, the brahmins: and this, gentlemen, is all I know about the robbers."</p>
               <p>Thus did little Doulee, in his own way, relate what had occurred, yet he threw but small light on the subject after all, and the company regarded his narrative as quite vague and incoherent. As they looked towards the mountains they observed another personage approaching the shore.</p>
               <p>"Yonder," said the juggler, "is Yam, the giant. I'll jump in the boat and fetch him over."</p>
               <p>"There is no use of that," replied the elder brahmin, "he'll prefer to wade the stream—see, he is coming already."</p>
               <p>All eyes were now fastened upon him as he stalked through the water, which, in the deepest part, did not reach much above his hips, so great was his stature. He now approached the island and stepped upon the bank. Abidah and Sind gazed upon him with wonder. He was of enormous size and heavy countenance, with a sheep skin thrown over his back, and a huge club on his shoulders. As he drew near the company he gave a sort of nod by way of salutation, and then threw himself at full length on the grass. Little Doulee whispered to Abidah to be careful what he said to him, as he was very morose; and Jok, at a hint given by the brahmins, brought him a pipe. After some time the elder brahmin thus spoke:</p>
               <p>"Friend Yam, Doulee tells us the robbers are about, but owing to the confusion which their approach no doubt caused, he does not give us quite as clear and distinct an account as we should like. As you are just from the neighbourhood, perhaps you might favour us with further information on the subject."</p>
               <p>The giant replied: "It was true the robbers were on the mountains plundering the shepherds; that they also intended making a descent on the Isle of Palms before they returned home; and that his object in coming over was to give notice to his friends to be on their guard."</p>
               <p>This information alarmed the company very much, especially Abidah and Sind, as they doubted not but the mauraders had got intelligence of their where abouts, and were coming to recapture them. They consulted what was best to be done; Yam and Jok advising that they should make all haste to escape; but the others thought differently, saying if they<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC5973-00000020"/> attempted it they surely would be overtaken; that the best plan for them was to conceal themselves on the island; that perhaps after all the robbers might not come over for the spot was looked upon as sacred, and the brahmins had never as yet been molested by any one. In this opinion Abidah and Sind concurred, and as the afternoon passed away without any sign of the approach of their enemies, they began to feel quite easy.</p>
               <p>In the evening they entered the dwelling, and the lamps being lighted, preparations were made for supper. With the assistance of the cook, whom the captives had released, an excellent meal was prepared, and all sat down to it with hearty appetites. The wine circulated, and pipes were introduced, and the company grew quite merry; the brahmins and Abidah discussed philosophy. Jok related his adventures, and little Doulee's tongue was not quiet for a moment, but run so fast, flying from one subject to another, that it was hard to tell what he was talking about. As for Yam, after eating and drinking heartily, he leaned his head on the table and fell asleep, startling the company with his loud snoring. Thus did the party enjoy themselves till near midnight, nor did they show any signs of retiring, but forgot all their troubles and gave way to unrestrained mirth and good humor.</p>
               <p>Suddenly a noise was heard outside; Jok was the first to notice it, and cried out, "Here are the robbers bers;" then nimbly climbing one of the pillars which upheld the roof, and near which he was sitting, he removed a part of the thatch and slipping out, disappeared. The door now opened and Pharazac entered with his band, all armed to the teeth. The brahmins, Abidah, and. Sind, looked surprised but said nothing, little Doulee hid himself beneath the table, and the giant jumping up stood in the middle of the room with his club uplifted.</p>
               <p>"Yam," said the chief, "put down your stick; you are a match for half a dozen of us, I know, but my whole band is with me and it is useless for you to make resistance; I have no intention to do you any harm; and, indeed, should be loath to spoil such a fine specimen of humanity as you are. I have come merely to recover some captives who slipped out of my hands once, but will not, I think, do so again."</p>
               <p>The giant made no reply, but retiring to a corner coiled himself on a mat and again went to sleep. Pharazac now told the brahmins that he was sorry to intrude within their domains, but he understood that some of his runaways had harboured themselves there whom he could not afford to lose.</p>
               <p>"And here I see them all," continued he, "except one who seems to be missing; but I care not a straw for him, for knave and conjurer as he is I am glad to be rid of him; I know his tricks and will keep clear of him in future, and let him, too, beware and<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC5973-00000021"/> keep clear of me. But come; you have all had your suppers, let us now have ours." So saying, he sat down to the table and his men with him, one being posted at the door as sentinel.</p>
               <p>They feasted and drank, and grew quite uproarous; and Abidah and his friends having retired to another part of the room gazed silently on the scene. Meanwhile, little Doulee remained in his hidingplace, terrified at the noise and clamour of the revellers, who sometimes in their vehement discourse would bring their fists down so hard on the table as almost to split it. He tried to extricate himself by creeping from his awkward position, but in doing so was detected.</p>
               <p>"Whose dog is this under the table?" said Pharazac; and so saying, amid shouts of laughter, he took the dwarf by the nape of the neck, and lifting him up set him on the table. "Where in the world did this creature come from, friend brahmin?" asked the chief, "and who is he?"</p>
               <p>"His name is Doulee," answered the brahmin; "he lives on the mountain, and is a shepherd and a very excellent and worthy one; he happened to fall under the table just as you entered, and, I suppose, did not wish to disturb you when you were once seated."</p>
               <p>The dwarf did not much like his new position, and, endeavoured to descend from it; but this the men would not permit, and as fast as he attempted to get on the floor they would gently stick him with the points of their daggers; and in this manner kept him running up and down the table, smashing the dishes and presenting a most comical sight. Doulee, as might be expected, not relishing the joke, began to grow angry, and with a stern look unsheathed his poignard; at which one of the robbers was so incensed that he drew his sword and would have dispatched him on the spot had not Pharazac interfered, who allowed the little man to descend from the platform and rejoin his friends, which he did in no very amiable mood.</p>
               <p>It was by this time pretty late, and the chief having posted guards lay down to sleep, telling his men to do the same, and enjoining them to be ready in the morning for an early start. Next day by sunrise they were all in motion, and Pharazac informed Abidah that himself with Sind and the black slave were each to be placed on horseback behind one of his men, and in this manner were to be transported to the place from which they had fled. The band then went out to collect their horses which had been tethered during the night round the cabin.</p>
               <p>By this time Yam had awoke, and, seeing the robbers had left the apartment, he fastened the door and stood close to it with his club in his hand; and when the chief ordered it to be opened, he replied that he would knock down the first man who entered. Pharazac and his men were much disconcerted<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC5973-00000022"/> certed by this bold proceeding, pounding at the door with all their might, and vowing vengeance to all within. This clamour lasted some time, then silence succeeded and it seemed to the listeners as though the band were moving off. Yam now made a small opening in the thatch, and told Doulee to mount on his shoulders and see what was going on outside.</p>
               <p>"An excellent idea," exclaimed Abidah; "tell us quick, Doulee, what you see; are the rogues decamping or still lurking about? or are they going to set fire to the building and burn us all up?"</p>
               <p>"Be patient," replied the dwarf, who by this time had clambered on the giant's back and thrust his head through the hole; "be patient, I say; I cannot do every thing at once; my post is no enviable one I assure you; I'll do all I can to accomadate but I'm not going to stretch my head too far out for the robbers to shoot at."</p>
               <p>"Take your own plan, Doulee," returned the youth; "but report to us as soon as you can, for we are all dying to hear."</p>
               <p>After a short pause, during which the dwarf scolded Yam several times for not standing still enough; he thus gave the result of his survey to the company who eagerly crowded round to listen:</p>
               <p>"The robbers," said he, "are not lurking about, nor do they show any signs of setting fire to the building; but they have all mounted their horses and are moving towards the river."</p>
               <p>"What!" cried the prince, "do they intend to retreat?"</p>
               <p>"How can I tell what they intend?" answered little Doulee; "I thought you put me here to relate facts, and instead of that you pester me with questions."</p>
               <p>"Do not interrupt him, Abidah," said Sind; "Doulee, I am sure, will faithfully and correctly describe every thing that transpires."</p>
               <p>"Certainly I will," returned the dwarf; "if I am not interrupted. Well, as I was going to say, the robbers have mounted their horses and are moving towards the river; they have now reached the shore and are wading into the stream; some of them have got into deep water and are beginning to sink; no, I am mistaken, they are swimming their horses; they have passed the middle of the river and will soon ascend the bank; no, I'm not so sure of that either; I see another band of horsemen coming down to the shore to meet them; from all that I can gather they seem disposed to dispute their passage; am I right or wrong? why, right, as I always am. Good heavens, what a volley of arrows!. I can stand it no longer; I must draw in my head or I'll be a dead man as sure as my name's Doulee;" and so saying the dwarf withdrew from the hole. The bystanders, whose interest was wrought up to a high pitch, begged the little man to take another look; and<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC5973-00000023"/> after a good deal of coaxing he peeped out again and thus continued:</p>
               <p>"A terrible battle is now raging; arrows are flying in all directions, and bright swords and spears are intermingled; the water is stained with blood; men drop from their horses and are seen no more, and horses are swimming away from their riders. One of the new chiefs looks like a Rajah; am I mistaken or is that Jok, the juggler, among them? no, I'm right again; I know him by his red beard. Pharazac is fighting like a lion; the Rajah and he have met; they contend hand to hand. Pharazac's horse seems to be wounded; the Rajah has seized him by the bridle and tries to pull him into deep water; he does not succeed; the robber backs him up on a sand bank, and mounts a fresh horse; the Rajah follows him and they fight again fiercer than ever. Pharazac falls. But I miss Jok; where can he be? poor fellow, I fear he's either dead or wounded."</p>
               <p>At this moment a noise was heard on another part of the roof, and the juggler glided down into the room in the same manner that he had escaped the night before. The company were surprised and overjoyed at seeing him, and little Doulee hastily descended from the giant's back.</p>
               <p>He told them, in a few words, that when he left on the previous evening, he directed his course to the residence of the nearest Rajah, who lived at a town some distance off. That by traveling very fast and exerting himself to the utmost, he was enabled to arrive there pretty early in the morning. That he informed him that a band of robbers was ravaging his territories and was now at the Isle of Palms, where they might be easily captured if prompt measures were adopted. Jok then went on to relate how the Rajah set out immediately with a troop of horse, that a battle, as they were aware, had just taken place, in which the robbers were routed and Pharazac slain; "but come," continued the juggler; "let us open the door and welcome our deliverers, for I hear them now approaching."</p>
               <p>The door was opened and the Rajah and his followers entered. They were heartily thanked by the company for their kind services, and the best refreshment that the place afforded was set before them. After resting some time they prepared to depart, and the chief signified to Abidah and the others that he was about to proceed to Delhi to report to the Sultan what had taken place, and that it was necessary they should accompany them. As Abidah and Sind were also on their route to that city they were well pleased with the arrangement; and having mounted their horses the whole party bade adieu to the Isle of Palms and set out for the capital.</p>
               <p>While these adventures were happening to Abidah, the old king remained at Lassa, and soon after the<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC5973-00000024"/> departure of his son, began to fall a prey to deep anxiety. He regretted that he had allowed the young man to leave him; and his mind conjured up a thousand evils that he feared might befall him. 'Tis true he had great confidence in his companion, Sind, and believed that he would do his best to advise and direct him, yet he well knew the impetuosity of the prince, and feared that he would be under little or no restraint from his tutor. So nervous did the old king become that he sent out messengers to get tidings, if it were possible, of the travelers and bring them back; but his efforts were fruitless, and he resolved at last that he would himself set out for Delhi and get the Sultan to assist him in discovering his lost son, who he thought might be found in that city.</p>
               <p>He accordingly started with a small retinue, and in due time reached the place of his destination. The Sultan received him in a princely manner, but could give him no information about Abidah, telling him that he had neither seen nor heard of such a person, and though diligent search was made in the city and neighbourhood, no traces of him could be found. The king, therefore, prepared to return home, sorely grieving and much dispirited at his ill success.</p>
               <p>The day before he departed the Sultan honoured him with a grand entertainment, got up in the most costly style, and after the feasting was over various shows were exhibited, as is customary on such occasions. The governor of the feast now informed the Sultan that one of his Rajahs had just arrived with a number of captives, among whom was a giant, and a dwarf, and other singular characters, a sight of whom might, perhaps, be gratifying to his guests.</p>
               <p>"Let them be introduced by all means," said the Sultan.</p>
               <p>Presently a door opened and little Doulee entered with a smiling face, and making many profound bows to the royal party; after him, in stalked Yam, the giant, with his huge club and sheep-skin cloak, the company much admiring his vast size and wellformed limbs; Jok, the juggler came next, and after him the three venerable brahmins, with their long white beards and flowing robes. Next came Abidah, whom though much sunburnt and with his garments much the worse for wear, his father instantly recognized. With a cry of joy and surprise, he sprang forward and threw himself on his son's neck, begging him to tell him how he got there, and how he ever came to be mingled with such strange company.</p>
               <p>The young man was equally astonished at seeing his father, and proceeded to relate,in a few words, the various adventures by which he had been led to his present extraordinary condition. The king gazed at his son's forlorn appearance with a look of<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC5973-00000025"/> pity, yet, at the same time, could scarcely forbear smiling.</p>
               <p>"And so this," said he, "is the termination of your grand schemes; you left your home to carve out for yourself a great fortune, you were to gain victories, acquire territories, and make yourself the friend of kings and emperors; but, instead of that, you find yourself a wretched captive, with giants, jugglers, and dwarfs as your companions; and where, too, is that beautiful princess you so often talked of, whom you were to bring home to share your high destiny?"</p>
               <p>"Here she is," said Sind, smiling, and pointing to the black cook who stood by, and who had followed them ever since they had left the cave.</p>
               <p>Upon this the whole company burst into laughter, in which Abidah himself could not help joining.</p>
               <p>"Well," continued he, "I am now done with adventures, and will return home and be satisfied with the lot in which Providence placed me."</p>
               <p>"The Sultan was highly pleased with the novel scene he had witnessed, and ordered all the captives to be generously rewarded, giving them liberty to return to their homes or remain where they were, if they preferred. He prevailed on the king, too, to stay several days longer; and at his departure, loaded both him and the prince with presents. The father and son then returned to their own city, and Abidah was content to assist his parent in the government of the empire. In a few years the old king died, and Abidah, with the good wishes of the people, ascended the throne and reigned long and happily.</p>

               <head>STORY OF SULIMAN OF BAGDAD;</head>
               <head type="sub">OR, BLACK AND WHITE.</head>
               <p>I WAS born in the city of Bagdad, and am the son of a rich merchant. It was my custom, after getting through the business of the day, to resort in the evening to the coffee-house, where I passed the time smoking and drinking sherbet, in company with a number of young men with whom I was acquainted, and who, like myself, had just started in business. Being of a sprightly disposition, and possessing some wit, I took a pleasure in bantering my companions, and sometimes carried my jokes further than propriety would justify. But I received a lesson at last, and that too from a quarter where I least expected it, which effectually cured me of my folly; and which I now relate as a warning to all such as are addicted to raillery, and have too high an opinion of their own abilities.</p>
               <p>One night, being at the coffee-house as usual, I commenced teasing a young merchant named Abas, who was of a modest, quiet disposition, and whose peculiarities I set off in such a ludicrous light as to draw roars of laughter from the company; for he was so good-natured that I knew he would take offence at scarcely any thing I said to him.</p>
               <p>"Why, Abas," said I, "how you are ever to succeed in business is a miracle to me. You are so credulous and easily imposed upon, that I verily believe any fool could get ahead of you. Why, was it not but yesterday that you took from me a bad sequin, and put it in your pocket with as much glee as if you had drawn a prize in the lottery."</p>
               <p>"Why," answered Abas, "I did not think friend Suliman would pass counterfeit money."</p>
               <p>"Counterfeit fiddlestick," exclaimed I, "you should have thought nothing about it, but have tossed the sequin in my face; no, it's your simple, credulous disposition. Why, I could make you believe, if I chose, that white is black."</p>
               <p>"I think you would find that difficult," answered the young man, "for black and white are as different as fire and water, and to pass off one for the other would be out of the question, unless by some sleight of hand."</p>
               <p>"No sleight of hand about it," continued I, "I'll make you believe for six months that white's black, and lay you a wager of a hundred pieces of gold that I'll accomplish it."</p>
               <p>"Increase your wager to a thousand," answered Abas, "and I'll take you up."</p>
               <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC5973-00000027"/>
               <p>"Agreed!" exclaimed I, "and let these gentlemen be the witnesses."</p>
               <p>This singular bet caused much mirth to the company, who all said they thought I was undertaking a hard bargain, and would certainly lose my money. And having smoked out our last pipes, we all separated, after bidding each other good evening.</p>
               <p>I returned home, revolving all night as I lay in bed how I should carry out my scheme, for I knew if I failed I would forever lose my reputation among my friends as a wit; to say nothing of the thousand gold pieces at stake, which made the matter one of some importance, and which I was determined to succeed in at all hazards, regardless of any pain or labor in which it might involve me. After racking my brains, and passing, as I said, a sleepless night, I decided upon the following scheme: I determined to quit Bagdad for a few weeks, and take up my abode at a Nubian village, which was distant some dozen miles. There I would thoroughly learn all the manners and customs of the blacks: then I would paint myself from head to foot, and putting on the dress of a negro, would return to the city and hire myself to Abas, who I thought would never for a moment suspect who I was; and thus would I succeed in making him believe that white was black, and so win the bet.</p>
               <p>Full of my project, I arose in the morning, and proceeded to take measures to carry out my plans. Having made the necessary arrangements, and put what money I had in two secure bags, I took them in my hand, and went to Abas' shop. After the usual compliments, I asked him if he would do me the favor to take charge of my cash, telling him I was on the eve of starting on a voyage of business to India, to visit a rich uncle, who had often written for me; and that I should in all likelihood not be back for over a year. He seemed a good deal surprised when he heard this, and asked me if I had forgotten the wager.</p>
               <p>"Oh no," said I, "I have not forgotten the wager, but you know, Abas, that business is business, and must not be put aside for the sake of wagers: besides, when I return, I will have plenty of time and leisure to attend to our bet, provided you do not back out."</p>
               <p>"Oh never fear for me!" answered the young merchant; "but allow me to say you act like a sensible man in prefering business to amusement; that has always been my motto; and if it will not be troubling you too much, I would like you to buy me a case of the best India shawls, as I think at this time money may be made out of them."</p>
               <p>He then took my bags, telling me he would take the same care of them as if they were his own; and after bidding me farewell, and wishing me a safe journey, we separated.</p>
               <p>I then set out for the Nubian village, rejoicing<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC5973-00000028"/> that I had so well commenced my schemes, and laughing to think how nicely I had hoodwinked poor Abas. By spending my money judiciously, I soon ingratiated myself with the Nubians, and got them to teach me all their customs and modes of life. When I had remained there a few weeks, and thought myself sufficiently instructed, I got them to paint me black, to fix my hair, and furnish me with a dress, telling them I was about playing off a joke on some of my young friends at Bagdad. Having amply rewarded them and thanked them for their kindness, I returned to the city, which I reached about noon.</p>
               <p>So completely was I disguised that none of my friends or acquaintances recognized me, through numbers of them brushed by me; and I proceded at once to the shop of Abas, inquiring if he knew any one who wanted a servant. My friend was seated behind his counter in front of his store, very leisurely smoking his pipe, with heaps of rich merchandize piled around him. He gave a single glance at me, and inquired who I was, and whence I came.</p>
               <p>"I am a Nubian," answered I, "and a total stranger, poor and without employment; but I am honest and willing, and desire to earn my bread without being a charge to any one."</p>
               <p>"I am in want of a shopman," said the merchant, "and am willing to try you; for though you are a stranger, I like your looks: come in then, and begin at once. I will give you fair wages, and your work will be light. You may sit in the back of the shop, on yonder rug, and string beads. You must sweep out the place once a day, bring me water, and guard my property when I am away."</p>
               <p>I accordingly did as he directed, and entering the store took my seat in a corner where I was not likely to be observed, at the same time congratulating myself that my scheme was succeeding so well, and thinking how finely I had imposed upon Abas. But in this I was mistaken; for the cunning rogue knew me all the while, yet how he managed to preserve his composure I cannot for the life of me imagine; but I must go on with my story without anticipating.</p>
               <p>The life I led was of course irksome and monotonous, and nothing but my ambition of winning the bet would ever have imbued me with patience and resolution sufficient to encounter it. However, I derived some amusement in witnessing the scenes, and listening to the conversation which took place in the front of the shop, all which I had a fine chance of observing from my retired corner. The shop next to ours was occupied by a little gossiping tailor, and only separated from it by a curtain, which was usually rolled up, in order that the air might circulate more freely, and that my master and his neighbour might chat together when they felt disposed. One day, as they sat behind their counters smoking their pipes, the tailor thus opened the conversation:</p>
               <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC5973-00000029"/>
               <p>"Pray, Abas, tell me what has become of that friend of yours that used to be so intimate with you."</p>
               <p>"Who do you mean?" replied the other.</p>
               <p>"Oh, you know who I mean," said the tailor. "I mean Suliman, son of the rich silk merchant that died two years since."</p>
               <p>"Oh," answered Abas, "he was never intimate with me; but that's neither here nor there. You must know, then, that he sailed to India, to visit a wealthy uncle on some matters of business. I gave him a commission to execute for me, but I do not know how he will succeed in it: however, it's not anything of much value."</p>
               <p>"I believe he was considered a great wit, was he not?" asked the other.</p>
               <p>"He often played off his wit on other people, that's certain," returned Abas; "and many a time caused great laughter; but I think myself he was more of a buffoon than wit, and when he thought we were laughing at his sallies, we were nine times out of ten laughing at himself."</p>
               <p>"That's what I always thought," answered the tailor, "and what I have heard from all that spoke of him; as for myself, without reference to the opinions of any one, I must candidly say I always looked upon him as a great jackass."</p>
               <p>"Well," replied the merchant, "I do not know about that. Perhaps you are not so far from the truth; but we must not be too harsh, nor speak disrespectfully of persons that are absent."</p>
               <p>"By no means," said the tailor.</p>
               <p>"Who knows now," continued the other, "but that he may be dead and gone, lost at sea, or murdered by robbers, poor fellow?"</p>
               <p>"True, true," returned the tailor, "he may, as you say, be dead and gone; but if he is, he's no great loss, that's one comfort."</p>
               <p>Here the conversation was interrupted by the approach of a customer, and well did it happen so, for if the parties had continued it a moment longer I should certainly have sprung up and knocked their heads together, into such a passion did it put me. However, I was enabled to restrain myself, and bear with this and many other annoyances, looking forward to the period when my time would be up, and I would be able to claim the bet, and gain a triumph over Abas.</p>
               <p>Weeks and months passed, and my deliverance was fast drawing nigh; when, one morning, with a smiling countenance, Abas rushed into the stop.</p>
               <p>"News! news!" cried he; "I have just received a letter from friend Suliman, dated Calcutta."</p>
               <p>"That is news indeed," exclaimed the tailor, laying down his work; "and what does he say? Is his uncle dead, and has he left him his fortune? Is he well? Does the climate agree with him? What<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC5973-00000030"/> kind of a voyage had he out? And when does he return? Pray tell me all about it."</p>
               <p>"I will just read you the letter," answered the merchant, "and then you will have the whole matter before you in his own words." So saying, he drew from his bosom a letter, which he read off with great fluency; and well he might, for every word of it had been written by himself.</p>

                           <p>"My dear Abas:—I am rejoiced to have the happiness of writing to you. I have had much satisfaction in my journey hither, and all has turned out well. I found my uncle in good health; he is old and very rich. He treated me like a nabob. I bought the case of shawls you ordered, and splendid ones they are; I got them dog cheap, and they will pay you handsomely. My business is all finished, and I am preparing to return. I will be in Bagdad soon after this reaches you, if Allah wills it.</p>
                           <p>"So no more at present from your loving friend,</p>

               <p>What followed after the reading of this epistle I cannot say, for I was so confounded at hearing it that I hardly knew whether I was awake or dreaming. Who can this scoundrel be, thought I, that dares to fabricate such an impudent forgery, and what can be his motive? I was upon the point of jumping up and snatching the letter from the merchant, to look at the handwriting; but as this would have revealed who I was, and caused me to lose my bet, I restrained my feelings, determined, however, when the time expired, that I would sift the matter to the very bottom.</p>
               <p>At length the eventful day arrived which I had so long hoped and toiled for: I had won the bet; I had for six months passed myself off for a negro, and succeeded in making Abas believe that white was black: my triumph was complete. I counted the hours of the day, watching till the sun should reach the meridian, when the full time would expire.</p>
               <p>It was about eleven o'clock, and I was already making my arrangements to leave, or, as the saying is, beginning to pack up, when I suddenly heard a noise on the street, as of some one running; and, in a moment after, Abas rushed in, in breathless haste, exclaiming that Suliman had arrived!</p>
               <p>"You don't say so!" cried the tailor.</p>
               <p>"Indeed I do," answered the merchant; "I had a talk with him not a quarter of an hour ago, and have come to get ready the two bags of money he bailed to me when he sailed for India."</p>
               <p>"Sit down," replied the other, "and tell me how he looks, and all about him."</p>
               <p>"He looks just as usual," said Abas, "except that he is somewhat sunburnt: he is in high spirits, and is swimming in riches. He inquired kindly after you, and says you shall make him a dozen suits of clothes at any price you please."</p>
               <p>"The noble fellow!" exclaimed the tailor; "how<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC5973-00000031"/> I long to take him by the hand! Why, he's generosity broke loose."</p>
               <p>"There you've just hit it," replied the merchant, "he's generosity run mad, for he is, flinging his money about as if it were oyster-shells; and is playing the wildest freaks that any one can conceive of."</p>
               <p>"What!" asked the other, "has he set up as reformer, or has he turned philanthropist?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot say if he's turned philanthropist or not," continued Abas; "but his head's turned, that's certain. You know the beautiful country-seat his father built just before he died?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said the tailor, "I have stood and admired it a thousand times. What about it?"</p>
               <p>"Why," returned the merchant, "he is going to pull it all down, and says he will erect in its place a foundling hospital."</p>
               <p>"Mercy on us!" cried the tailor, raising his hands, "what is the world coming to!"</p>
               <p>"But I must hurry," said Abas, "and get ready his two bags of money; for I expect him here every moment to take them away."</p>
               <p>The words were scarcely out of his mouth when a noise was heard in the street; and the pretended Suliman rushed in, accompanied by a couple of porters. I saw at a glance that he bore a strong resemblance to me, though his face was flushed with the liquor in which he had evidently been indulging; but I had no time to scan him very closely, for I was so petrified with the extraordinary scenes enacting before me that I was almost bereft of reason. But I must hasten on with my story.</p>
               <p>"Well, friend Abas," commenced the pretended Suliman, "here I am got back to your shop again, safe and sound as ever; and here are you, too, Mr. Tailor, sitting on your board as usual, merry as a lark. Give me your hand, old fellow, and be ready to measure me for some new suits of clothes, the moment I'm at leisure; but when that will be I can hardly say, for I'm so full of business just now that I can scarcely turn round. But pray, Abas, what was that affair you had with me, and which you wished to have settled?"</p>
               <p>"It was merely to return you your two bags of money," replied the merchant, "which you left with me when you sailed for India." And so saying, he unlocked the chest, and laid them on the counter.</p>
               <p>"True, true," cried the impostor; "and I owe you a thousand thanks for taking care of them; but stop, keep one of the bags for your trouble, I'm sure you deserve it, and as for me, I'll never miss it."</p>
               <p>"No," answered the other, "I'll not take a; farthing; let the porters shoulder them at once and carry them to your residence; I will give them a piaster apiece for their wages."</p>
               <p>"A piaster apiece," exclaimed the impostor, "no, give them a handful of gold, poor fellows; money<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC5973-00000032"/> was made to spend, and what's the use of hoarding it up?"</p>
               <p>Thus far had I managed to keep quiet during these strange scenes; but seeing now that if things went on at this rate, my property would be all squandered, I thought it high time to have something to say in the business. I accordingly rose up and whispered to Abas that he had better be cautious what he was about or he might become involved in trouble: for I had grave doubts whether the person before him was the true Suliman, or, in other words, that I verily believed he was an impostor.</p>
               <p>"Me an impostor!" cried the other, who overheard what was said; "me an impostor, why you black rascal, what do you mean?"</p>
               <p>"I mean what I say," replied I; "that you are not the person you pretend to be, and have no right, whatever, to touch these bags of money."</p>
               <p>"This is strange behaviour," said Abas; "pray, Mr. Nubian, who gave you a right to meddle in the business, and what do you know about Suliman? You never even saw him; for you told me yourself you were a stranger direct from Nubia, and my friend Suliman had left Bagdad several weeks before you arrived."</p>
               <p>"I care not for that," returned I, "I have seen him a thousand times, and no one on earth knows him better."</p>
               <p>"And so you contradict yourself," answered the other, "and persist in telling an untruth; go lie down on your mat till the liquor you have been drinking has had time to evaporate;" and so saying, he pushed the bags to the impostor.</p>
               <p>On seeing this, I sprang forward and seized them, exclaiming, that the money belonged to me, and that I was Suliman.</p>
               <p>"A pretty Suliman, indeed," cried the tailor; "a pretty Suliman—with a face as black as a fryingpan."</p>
               <p>"Never mind my face, Mr. Cabbage-thief," said I, "but attend to your work, or I'll sew up your mouth, with one of your own needles."</p>
               <p>"Mercy on us!" exclaimed the tailor, jumping from his board into the street, "we'll be all murdered."</p>
               <p>"No," said I, "you'll not be murdered, but if you don't clear the passage and let me out, there'll be some bloody faces, that's certain."</p>
               <p>The pretended Suliman pushed me back, whereupon I commenced belabouring his shoulders with the bags; and so great had the hubbub now become that quite a crowd began to collect.</p>
               <p>"Send for the Cadi! send for the Cadi!" shouted a dozen voices. But there was no need of that, for the Cadi had already arrived, followed by four stout rod-bearers.</p>
               <p>"In the name of the Caliph," said he, "I command<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC5973-00000033"/> the peace, and let the owner of the shop step forward and explain the cause of this tumult."</p>
               <p>"That I'll do, Mr. Cadi," answered Abas; "as far as I am able. You must know, then, that my friend Suliman, who stands before you, arrived this day from India, and came here to receive these two bags of money, which I took charge of when he left the country; he was in the act of taking them away, when up jumps my black shopman, who claimed the property, and taxed my friend with being an impostor, saying that he himself is Suliman. What is the cause of such conduct I know not, but suppose the poor fellow has been drinking."</p>
               <p>"I've a short way of making people sober," said the Cadi; and no sooner were the words out of his mouth, than I was tripped up, my garment torn from me, and I held down on the floor, whilst the officers commenced belabouring me with their rods. I fairly screamed with rage, calling them thieves and villains, and in short, every word I could think of, and swearing that I would appeal to the Caliph for vengeance. The perspiration poured down my back, and the paint began to come off, showing my skin underneath.</p>
               <p>"Why," cried the spectatoes, "he's turning black and white!"</p>
               <p>"He'll be black and blue presently," replied the Cadi.</p>
               <p>"I hope not," said Abas; "black and white was what he bargained for, and he's had it, I think, to his heart's content. And now, Mr. Cadi, let me entreat you to punish this poor man no more, for he is, after all, the true Suliman; and this other is a creature of my own, who has assumed a false character for certain reasons that I will explain hereafter. Suffice it to say, that it originated in a bet between Suliman and myself; I give him full credit for the skillful means he adopted to outwit me, but I think he will confess, after what he has experienced, that I was quite a match for him."</p>
               <p>"Yes," answered I, rising up and taking him by the hand, "you have baffled me finely, and fairly won the bet; and though I have been handled somewhat roughly, yet I bear no ill will to you on that account, and have no one to blame but myself."</p>
               <p>Some one now handed me a basin of water, and I commenced washing the paint from my face; as I did so, much laughter burst from the bystanders. I pushed through the crowd and hurried home, followed by a throng of boys shouting after me—black and white. I was subjected to this annoyance whenever I appeared in the streets, and to rid myself of it, was compelled to sell out and quit the city, removing to a distant town, where I and my unfortunate wager were unknown.</p>

               <head>STORY OF LAVENDER THE ROMANTIC.</head>
               <p>I AM the son of a rich tea merchant, and was born in the great city of Pekin. I had a brother named Kiang, a year or two younger than myself, but far more polished in manners, and more of a favourite among the ladies. This made me somewhat envious of him, and I was continually endeavouring to emulate him and copy his ways, but generally with very little success; for his elegance and address were all natural, whereas mine was constrained and artificial, and often lad me to do things so wild and romantic as rather made me a laughing-stock than a gallant.</p>
               <p>We had a cousin named Lilliho, who resided with her parents, at a villa a few miles out of town. How shall I describe this paragon of loveliness! She was about fourteen years of age, plump, and round; her skin smooth as ivory, her eyes like two black beads and bright as diamonds, her nose flat; her hair, plaited together and braided with gold, almost reached the ground; as for her feet, they were so small that at first sight you would say she had none, and with difficulty was it that she was able to use them and walk; her ankles and hands were loaded with gold rings; and the huge fan she always carried she moved backward and forward so gracefully that it almost made one's heart break to look at her. Oh what pains we took to gain her regards! How many letters we wrote to her! How many presents we sent her!</p>
               <p>One morning, on coming down stairs and entering the store, I missed my brother Kiang, who was usually there before me, and inquired of our black slave Hoppo where he was.</p>
               <p>"Oh! Master Lavender," answered Hoppo, "he's been where you ought to have been: he was out all last night at your uncle's country-seat, serenading Miss Lilliho; and I suppose he is so tired that he has not been able to rise as early as usual this morning."</p>
               <p>"Go," said I, "and fetch me my violin this moment, that I may go out and serenade her too."</p>
               <p>"Why," returned the darkey, "are you going out this time of day to give a serenade? Serenades are always given in the night, and nobody ever heard of giving one in the day time."</p>
               <p>"No matter for that," said I, "it's better late than never; and if Kiang serenaded our cousin, I must do so too, for I cannot let him excel me in gallantry; so run quick, and fetch me the instrument."</p>
               <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC5973-00000035"/>
               <p>The slave, went as fast as his fat limbs would allow, though laughing all the while, and declaring I was the queerest gentleman he ever saw.</p>
               <p>So I took the violin, and preceeded as rapidly as I could to the villa, which was about a league out of town. I entered by the garden gate, and took my station under Lilliho's window, and commenced playing in my very best style. I played and played till I was almost tired out, looking up anxiously all the, while to see if the blinds would open, and my cousin's face would appear. After the lapse of several hours, the window was opened, and I had the pleasure of seeing the young lady, who spoke very politely to me, and rewarded me with one of her very sweetest smiles. I tuned my violin afresh, and began to play with new vigor, she all the while listening, and stringing beads for some embroidery work she was engaged in. Presently the string that connected the beads together broke, and they all fell out of the window on the grass.</p>
               <p>"Oh mercy!" cried she, "I've lost all my beads."</p>
               <p>I stooped to the ground in an instant to try and recover them, but my efforts were fruitless, and I told her I could not conceive where they had gone.</p>
               <p>"Oh, hunt for them!" exclaimed she.</p>
               <p>I did hunt for them, but without success, and no wonder, for they were no bigger than mustard seed, and green as grass in the bargain. Finding that I could accomplish nothing, she heaved a deep sigh, and telling me it was no matter, she said I should trouble myself about it no more, for that she would get my brother Kiang to find them the next time he paid her a visit.</p>
               <p>In a little while she came into the garden to take a walk, and I followed close behind her, playing as I went some of my choicest tunes. We crossed a small bridge, under which flowed a little stream of water bordered with flower-pots. At the end of the, garden to which we now came was a kind of orchard, and in it a peach tree, on which were some fine peaches. Here the lady made a halt, and expressed a desire for some of the fruit. Glad of an opportunity to exhibit my regard for her, I laid down my violin, and began to climb the tree; and arriving at a place where I could reach the peaches, I commenced throwing them down.</p>
               <p>"These are very poor ones, Lavender," said she; "if you climb higher, you will find them much larger and better."</p>
               <p>I did as she directed me, but had need of all my care in doing so; for a little distance above my head was a huge wasp-nest, and the fierce insects were already getting uneasy at my approach, and giving me warning to come no nearer. However I managed still to pick off some of the fruit and throw them in her lap; but had to do it in the most quiet and gentle manner, for fear of the wasps.</p>
               <p>"These are no better than the others," said she,<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC5973-00000036"/> "they look very nice, to be sure, but they are as hard as bullets. Shake the tree, my dear fellow: shake the tree."</p>
               <p>"Not for the world," said I, thinking of the hubbub it would make among the wasps; "not for the world: it would spoil the peaches; it would mash them to a jelly."</p>
               <p>"Never fear it," replied she; "but let me see what I can do, for you keep me too long waiting;" and so saying she took up a stone and threw it, intending to knock down the fruit; but instead of doing so she hit the wasp-nest right in the centre, upon which they all flew out and settled on my face. I uttered a scream, and fell to the ground, almost dead with pain. My cousin now perceived what she had done, and was overwhelmed with grief, endeavouring to soothe and comfort me by every means in her power.</p>
               <p>"Never mind, Lavender," said she, raising me up, "you are not so badly hurt, after all, you must forgive me for my carelessness in disturbing those horrid insects, which I declare upon my honour I had not the least idea of meddling with when I threw the stone, for I did not know they had a nest on the tree. But come, rise up, and lean upon my arm, and we will step down to the pond, and put a little mud on your wounds, which will relieve the pain in a moment, and you will be presently as well as ever."</p>
               <p>Soothed and flattered by her kind behaviour, I accompanied her to the water, and, stooping down to the shore, I took up a handful of mud and plastered it on my face, and telling her I felt better already, I took another turn with her around the garden.</p>
               <p>In a little while the gong sounded for dinner, and I was about to return home, but she forbade me doing so, and very politely invited me to remain and partake of her father's hospitality. I felt highly honoured at this invitation; and, proceeding with her to the house, I entered the dining-room, not remembering that my face was plastered over with mud.</p>
               <p>There was a large company of ladies and gentlemen assembled, and the table was loaded with all kinds of delicacies, which I was resolved to have my share of, for I was excessively hungry; having left home in the morning, as I said before, without my breakfast. I accordingly took my seat, but no sooner had done so, than I perceived the whole company staring at me. I was somewhat disconcerted at this, but soon plucked up my courage. Ah! I see how it is, thought I, these people look upon me as a boy, and think me unfit to mix with them, but I'll show them I'm as much of a man as any of them, and that I don't mind them a bit. I then took up a ladle with the intention of helping myself to some bird's-nest soup, which was in a tureen near me, and of which I was extravagantly fond. I had the ladle in my hand, and was about dipping it into the dish, when a gentleman on my right side, with a very polite bow, addressed me.</p>
               <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC5973-00000037"/>
               <p>"Excuse me, sir," said he, "but there's a little trifling speck of dirt on your face."</p>
               <p>"It's on my right cheek, is it not?" answered I.</p>
               <p>"Precisely so," returned he.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, I took up the napkin, and touched my cheek with it, and raising the ladle approached it to the dish. I was just about helping myself, when the gentleman on my left, with a polite bow, addressed me.</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, sir," said he, "but there's the least trifling speck of dirt on your face."</p>
               <p>"It's on my left cheek, is it not?" said I.</p>
               <p>"Precisely so," answered he.</p>
               <p>So I took up the cloth and applied it to my left cheek; then taking the spoon I made another attack on the soup. But, just as I was helping myself, a guest on the opposite side of the table, made the same remark as the others, and, with a low bow, addressed me.</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, sir," said he, "but your face has a slight speck upon it."</p>
               <p>"It must be on my forehead, then," returned I.</p>
               <p>"Precisely so," answered the other.</p>
               <p>Upon which I rubbed the napkin upon my forehead; and, thinking that the spot was certainly removed by this time, I took up the spoon and made another attempt to help myself to the soup. But now, too, I was doomed to be disappointed, for when I had got the ladle filled, and was about moving it to my plate, another gentleman, in front, leaned over to me with a polite bow, and observed that there was something on my face that I did not seem to be aware of.</p>
               <p>"What!" thought I, "is not that cursed speck off yet, or is this some trick the guests are playing on me? or, is it some new fangled custom just introduced into society to torment people? Oh, no—I see what it is, it's selfishness, pure selfishness; they are determined to keep me from having my share of the bird's-nest soup, intending to keep it all to themselves; well, let them have it, I'll not contend with them, but will shame them if I can, out of their ill manners;" and, with these reflections, I dashed the ladle on the table, and pushed the tureen as far from me as I could. I then turned my face round to the waiters, who were carving a turkey at a side-table behind me; and, handing my plate to them, begged them to give me a slice. As soon as they saw me they all gave a broad grin, stuffing their napkins in their mouths to prevent them from bursting into a laugh; at which I was so mortified that I was glad to avert my face from them, and said nothing more about the turkey, as it seemed that they too, like every one else in the room, had entered into a conspiracy to starve me.</p>
               <p>I wished that I had refused my cousin's invitation to dinner, which was turning out so badly, and thought how much better it would have been had I<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC5973-00000038"/> remained in the garden, where I could have got a plentiful meal of peaches if nothing else. I was now so hungry that I resolved to seize upon any thing within my reach, and pay no attention to any remark that might be made to me; so, seeing a pitcher of milk close by me, I seized it; but, alas! there was nothing out of which to drink; so I called to one of the servants to fetch me a glass.</p>
               <p>"With all my heart," replied he, thinking, or pretending to think, I meant a looking-glass; and in a few moments he returned with a small mirror, which he very officiously held before me. The sight almost horrified me; for I saw now that my face was plastered over with mud, which I had put on to relieve it from the stings of the wasps. I sprang from the table, and with one bound rushed from the room; and, as the door closed behind me, I heard peals of laughter bursting from the guests. I directed my steps to the city, and in the course of an hour reached home, and found my brother Kiang standing at the door, who asked me where I had been.</p>
               <p>I told him I had been out in the country to see Lilliho, who had treated me with the utmost kindness and affability, even inviting me to dinner, and that I had accepted her polite invitation, and had now just returned from partaking of her entertainment.</p>
               <p>"That was an honour, indeed," answered my brother; "and I suppose our uncle gave you a fine dinner, for he does not do things by halves."</p>
               <p>"Oh, first rate," said I, "such lots of bird's-nest soup, shark fins, turkeys, puddings, preserves, and jellies, I never saw in all my life; but I must go in and take a nap after it, for I eat so heartily and feel so full, that I'm almost afraid of going off in an apoplexy;" so saying, I slyly crept into the kitchen and snatched up what first came to hand, for I was really half starved.</p>
               <p>The next morning my cousin came to town to do some shopping, and my brother Kiang had, by appointment, escorted her through the streets to make her purchases, wheeling her himself in a little kind of go-cart, fitted up with a top with crimson curtains and cushions. When I came out of the house, I found this little carriage in front of the door and my brother standing by, watching it very carefully. The curtains were all closely drawn down, and Kiang informed me that he believed he had wheeled Lilliho to all the shops in town, where he had bought for her, gauzes, crapes, fans, jewelry, and he knew not what, intending to take her and the articles back to the villa on horseback, but that, somehow or other, his cousin had become drowsy, and fallen asleep, and on arriving at the house he had drawn down the curtains and given orders to the slave Hoppo to mount guard over the carriage and give him instant notice when the lady showed any signs of awaking.<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC5973-00000039"/> But the lazy rogue, who could not be trusted for a moment it seemed, had stolen away, and he now begged me to take his place and watch the vehicle till Lilliho awoke, as he had a little urgent business which required his attention for a short time, otherwise he would not think of troubling me.</p>
               <p>"Trouble!" exclaimed I; "I don't call it trouble; it is the sweetest pleasure you could confer on me; I would watch over Lilliho for weeks and months, and am only too thankful for the opportunity of doing so. Go in, then, to your business; for I will take good care of her, and not run away as Hoppo did. He thanked me for my kindness, and entered the house; whereupon I sat down on the step listening to the lady's gentle snorings, and watching intently for the slightest signs of motion.</p>
               <p>How quietly and sweetly she reposes, said I to myself; and how I long to lift the curtain and take a peep at the sleeping beauty. But that would never do: it would be an ungallant intrusion on her privacy which I dare not think of; besides, it might rouse her from her peaceful sleep, which has no doubt been brought on by fatigue from looking at and handling the beautiful presents Kiang bought her. But, oh! how will she bear the rough rider home on horseback! It makes my heart ache to think of it. Poor thing! how much letter it would be to wheel her out in this little carriage; then she might sleep on undisturbed; to be sure, it's a long pull, but then my cousin is not heavy, so the weight would be small; besides, it would be quite an exploit, and I should be honoured for it, and gain Lilliho's heart to a certainty.</p>
               <p>Filled with these ideas, I rose up and resolved to carry them into execution: so I took hold of the tongue of the cart, and began pulling it very gently along. Contrary to my expectations I found it quite heavy, and wondered what could be the cause of it. I dragged it through the streets as fast as I could, for I feared lest Kiang should get wind of the matter and follow after me; and if he should succeed in overtaking me, I knew that a quarrel would ensue. At length I got out of town; and leaving now the smooth pavement, I had to toil along the sandy road. I found this very laborious, and wondered more and more what could make the concern so heavy. The carriage itself, said I, is mere silk and wickerwork, and is of no weight at all; and as for my cousin, she too weighs but little; to be sure, there are the goods which my brother purchased, but they must be light, for he told me himself they consisted of crapes and gauzes; but stop—he said something about buying sweetmeats for our aunt; ah! it must be that that makes the load; but what a lot of them there must be: fifty pounds of ginger at the very least, to say nothing of the jars and syrup; what could have possessed him to buy such a lot? I wish he had it all in his craw.</p>
               <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC5973-00000040"/>
               <p>But there was no use of repining. I had got into the business, and was resolved to carry it through; the sun beat upon me, and the perspiration rolled in torrents, so I took off my jacket, and hid it under a tree by the roadside, and addressed myself to my work with renewed spirit, comforting myself with the thoughts of the great honour I should receive for my extraordinary act of gallantry. I toiled along, up hill and down hill, compelled at every few steps to halt and take breath, and venting my curses continually on the confounded ginger and on my brother's stupidity in buying such a batch of it. At last, after two hours of this weary labour, I came in sight of my uncle's villa, and right glad was I to find that the garden gate was open, for I was now so overcome with exhaustion, that I hardly think I should have had strength or spirit to have opened it. I pulled in the vehicle, and toiled up the gravel walk, puffing and blowing at every step, and halting continually to take breath, rejoicing that my work was now at an end, and at the praises that I expected would be lavished upon me.</p>
               <p>The family were all on the piazza, and, as I drew near, exclaimed, "Why, if here isn't Lavender, bringing our Lilliho home in a go-cart!" And my aunt and uncle came forth to assist the young lady in getting out.</p>
               <p>"Stand back!" cried I, "stand back, all of you; for as I had the labour of bringing her here, I think I am entitled to the privilege of helping her out of her carriage; besides she is in a sweet sleep, which she has enjoyed during the whole ride, and I would not for the world have any one to disturb her."</p>
               <p>"And did you really draw her all the way out from town?" asked my aunt.</p>
               <p>"Indeed I did," I replied; "and not only her, but a whole shopful of silks, laces, crapes, gauzes, and jewelry—besides; fifty pounds of preserved ginger as a present for yourself, clear as amber, and of the first quality; but you will see all presently and judge with your own eyes, for I think it cannot be long now before the little lady arouses from her slumbers."</p>
               <p>A rustling was now noticed within the carriage, and all eyes were turned towards it, when suddenly a loud yawn was heard, the curtain moved aside, and the big wooly head of our negro slave Hoppo thrust out! We were all petrified with horror.</p>
               <p>"Where is my Lilliho?" cried my uncle.</p>
               <p>"Where is my preserved ginger?" cried my aunt.</p>
               <p>"Let me out!" cried the darkey, "oh please let me out!" and so saying, with great difficulty and after upsetting the cart, he managed to get out.</p>
               <p>"And so this is our Lilliho, that Master Lavender was so gallant as to draw all the way from Pekin," exclaimed my uncle, bursting out into a fit of laughter.</p>
               <p>"And so this is my preserved ginger," exclaimed my aunt, "clear as amber and of the first quality;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC5973-00000041"/> and what a lot of it! fifty pounds! you ought rather to have said half a ton!"</p>
               <p>"But come, Hoppo," said my uncle, "do not stand scratching your head; but explain to us this strange business."</p>
               <p>"You must know, then," replied he, "that this morning Master Kiang bid me keep guard over the carriage whilst Miss Lilliho slept. In a little while the young lady awoke and got out, telling me she believed she would go up stairs and lie down. As I felt very drowsy myself, I thought I would just creep into the cart, and take a comfortable nap, which I accordingly did, first pulling the curtains all close; and there I slept till this blessed moment, but what happened since, or how in the world I ever got out here, I cannot for the life of me explain."</p>
               <p>On hearing this the whole party (myself excepted) burst out into the most obstreperous mirth, which was echoed back by a lady and gentleman on horseback who at that moment entered the gate, and who were none other than my cousin Lilliho and Kiang; the latter waving over his head in triumph my jacket, which it seemed he had picked up on the road. I uttered not a word, but retreated as fast as I could toward the back of the house, then avoiding as much as possible the highway, I scampered over hedges, fences, and ditches, without once stopping to look back till I reached the city. I retired immediately mediately to my chamber, and did not emerge from it for a whole week; nor did I ever afterwards indulge in any romantic adventures or feats of gallantry.</p>

               <head>STORY OF THE FOOL AND THE DOCTOR.</head>
               <p>IT was once the custom in India, and probably is so now, for every one, who had the leisure and means, to make once in his life a pilgrimage to the sacred city of Allahabad. There was a certain doctor, a man of property and somewhat advanced in life, who thought that he would comply with this honourable usage, though he grudged very much the expense it would put him to, for he was miserly in the extreme, and so selfish and cunning as to be quite notorious in the town where he lived. He studied nobody's interest or comfort but his own, and used every mean trick in his power to impose upon others, saying there was no use in having friends, if one could not use them. In short, he was a person who, according to the proverb, would set his neighbour's house on fire to roast his own eggs.</p>
               <p>In the same town lived a half-witted fellow named Zaby, who, hearing so much said about going to Allahabad, thought that he too would make a journey thither, though he knew not rightly what going to Allahabad meant, nor indeed where it was. When the doctor heard that this worthy personage was going, he was much pleased, for he resolved that he would secure him as a traveling companion; to be sure he would be but a sorry person to converse with, for he had neither information nor intelligence, but all that was nothing: he could impose upon him, and make use of him in a thousand different ways, and that was just what he wanted. He accordingly imparted his views to the other, who was highly delighted with the scheme, being glad to have the protection and guidance of the doctor, and also considering it a high honour to have the privilege of traveling in company with so learned a person. They therefore made all their arrangements for the tour, and got ready their cash, which each put up in a large bag, and carried in his hand.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, one fine summer morning did these two worthies sally forth on their expedition, Zaby asking his companion over and over again whether he was right sure he knew the way, and if they were likely to encounter any dogs or other frightful beasts. Being assured on these points, they proceeded on their route very harmoniously for some distance, when the doctor broke silence, and thus addressed his comrade:</p>
               <p>"Zaby," said he, "that heavy bag you carry seems to incommode you very much: it makes you walk all lop-sided. I fear very much it, will bring on a<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC5973-00000043"/> curvature of the spine, or a compound fracture. or at least that your arm will become dislocated."</p>
               <p>"My arm dislocated!" replied the other, "and what will be done to it then?"</p>
               <p>"Why, it will have to be amputated, that's all," answered the doctor.</p>
               <p>"Mercy on us!" cried the fool, "that's dreadful; but how can I avoid it? I cannot leave my bag behind."</p>
               <p>"That's true enough," answered his companion; "a traveler without money is like a cart without wheels; but I'll fix the matter for you in a trice: here, take this bag of mine, and carry it in your other hand; it will balance you, and make you walk straight as an arrow, and with ten times the comfort you do now." And with these words he placed the bag in the fool's hand, asking him if he did not find it a great help to him.</p>
               <p>"Oh yes," returned Zaby, "it has straightened me up wonderfully. I'm as well balanced now as a pair of saddlebags, and instead of being lop-sided can walk as straight and erect as anybody."</p>
               <p>"So you do, and I really can't help looking at and admiring your fine figure;" replied the doctor, at the same time almost bursting with inward laughter, at the fine trick he had played on his comrade in making him carry his heavy bag.</p>
               <p>They now jogged along very comfortably and in high spirits, the doctor especially, and about noon arrived at a deep though narrow stream, which it was necessary to cross in pursuing their route. There was no bridge, neither could they find any boat, though they hunted very carefully for one; so they were much perplexed what to do, but after following the creek some distance down they fortunately discovered a tree, which, either by accident or design, had been prostrated and lay across the stream, thus forming a sort of bridge, though not a very comfortable or safe one.</p>
               <p>The doctor, however, though he was naturally very timorous, was resolved to attempt a passage; and after examining the log carefully and telling his comrade to keep off till he had crossed, and by all means not to shake it, he commenced very cautiously to step upon the trunk of the tree, and, with great difficulty, sometimes crawling on all fours, he at length succeeded in reaching the opposite bank. He now called out to Zaby to follow him, telling him to be very careful, and above all things to hold on to the bags; whereupon the fool commenced crossing. When he reached the middle of the creek a sudden fright seized him, and thinking himself in danger of falling, he caught at an overhanging branch to steady himself, and in doing so, without thinking of it, let go of his bag, which fell into the water.</p>
               <p>"Oh, doctor!" cried he, "I've lost my money; and what a place you've brought me to, I can neither go forward nor backward, you've been a pretty guide<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC5973-00000044"/> indeed! I expected you would show me a good road and not lead me over trunks of trees, and terrible rivers at the risk of being drowned."</p>
               <p>"My good Zaby," answered the other, "do not stand talking so foolishly, but come ahead; there's nothing to fear, man, so travel on."</p>
               <p>"How can I travel when I've lost my money?" said the simpleton; "you told me a traveler without money was like a cart without wheels."</p>
               <p>"For heaven's sake, hurry up!" exclaimed the doctor, "and bring me my bag."</p>
               <p>"Your bag," cried the other, "is the very thing that stops me, it will be the death of me if you don't haste and relieve me of it, it's making me lose my balance and dislocating my shoulder; hurry, doctor, or I'll have to let go of it—there, by heavens, it's gone!" and as he thus spoke the bag fell into the river.</p>
               <p>The doctor on beholding his loss became almost frantic with vexation; however, he refrained from upbraiding his companion, thinking it would be but a useless waste of time; and, cutting a long pole, he scrambled to the middle of the log and asked Zaby to show him exactly where the bag fell, hoping that he might he able to fish it up. Finding all his efforts fruitless, he told his comrade there was no way now of regaining their treasures except by diving after them. After some coaxing he persuaded the simpleton to comply, telling him that he would willingly do so himself if he was not so fat, but for him to attempt it would be like trying to sink a bladder, which he well knew was impossible.</p>
               <p>It was arranged accordingly, that Zaby should dive after the bags; but now a new difficulty arose, for though he admitted he could easily get to the bottom of the water, he was puzzled to think how he should get to the top again, until the other told him that he would tie a string round his waist, and hold one end in his hand, so that when he had secured their lost treasures he could be drawn up again in a moment.</p>
               <p>They accordingly tied together their garters and such other strings as they could muster, one end being fastened round Zaby's waist and the other placed in his companion's hand.</p>
               <p>"But stop," cried the other, "had I not better tie the end to your ankle, doctor? for if you hold it in your hand you might let go of it just as I did of the bags."</p>
               <p>To this arrangement his friend willingly acceded, and the string was accordingly fastened to his ankle; whereupon all being ready, Zaby sprang into the river, dragging the poor doctor after him.</p>
               <p>The latter set up a scream of terror at this unexpected catastrophe, and the two worthies floundered about in the water in the most pitiable manner, each clinging to the other, and both half dead with fright.</p>
               <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC5973-00000045"/>
               <p>"Oh, let go of me," cried the doctor, "I can scarce keep my head above water, and you are sinking me deeper and deeper every moment."</p>
               <p>"You can't sink," roared the simpleton, "you're too fat, you swim like a bladder;" whereupon he sprang on his friend's back, pulling him entirely beneath the surface, and paddling as he best could, succeeded at length in reaching the shore and scrambling up the bank.</p>
               <p>Slowly and half dead the doctor followed him, looking like a drowned rat, with the water pouring from his mouth, ears, and nose; and, so exhausted was he, that it was some time before he was able to speak.</p>
               <p>"We are in a bad fix, Zaby," said the doctor; "and I fear our bags are lost, unless you can manage, some how or other, to wade after them."</p>
               <p>"No," replied Zaby, "I dived after them, and that's quite enough for me; you may wade after them yourself."</p>
               <p>They now wrung the water out of their clothes, and dried them in the sun in the best manner they could, and in the course of an hour or so proceeded on their journey. Being without money they were compelled to beg their food, and generally met with kind treatment from the inhabitants. Proceeding further on their route, they came to one of those vast level plains, which are common in some parts of India; it was clothed with a parched and scanty vegetation, and few or no dwellings were to be seen. As they traveled wearily over this toilsome expanse, the doctor spied, at a distance, a creature of some kind or other quietly grazing. It was a miserable beast of an ass, half starved and half dead, which being of no use to the owner, he had, after stripping it of its shoes and halter, turned it adrift on the commons; and whose carcass was doomed, before long, to become the prey of dogs and crows. The doctor, who was half dead with fatigue, was rejoiced at beholding this miserable quadruped, and was resolved to make use of it to forward him on his journey, even if it were only for a short distance, which, from outward appearances, was likely to be the case. He accordingly walked ahead and made up to it, and after patting and coaxing it he managed to get upon its back and set it moving.</p>
               <p>"Pray, what kind of beast is that?" asked Zaby, as he drew near to it.</p>
               <p>"It's a wild ass," replied the other; "and a dreadful creature it is; keep away from its heels, my dear fellow, or you'll have your brains knocked out before you know where you are."</p>
               <p>The fool, frightened out of his wits at these words, drew back, keeping at a respectable distance, while his companion chuckled at his good luck, and, by keeping up a succession of vigorous digs against the poor ass's flank, managed to keep him in motion, though at a very moderate rate indeed. This continued<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC5973-00000046"/> tinued for some time until Zaby, seeing how quietly the animal behaved, and how comfortably his friend was getting along, ventured again to approach, and thus began:</p>
               <p>"Doctor," said he, "methinks you have broke this fierce beast most splendidly; he's as quiet as a cow, and the veriest child could mount him; don't you think it my turn now to have a ride? fair play's a jewel, you know; and I assure you, my poor feet are almost blistered tramping over this dusty plain."</p>
               <p>"My dear fellow," exclaimed the doctor, "don't think of such a thing! you would be thrown sky-high in a moment; it's as much as I can do to manage the beast, though I studied equestrianism a dozen years; why, there's spirit enough in him to make a dozen war-horses: just see how he rears. And so saying, he stuck his dagger in the poor animal's shoulder, which caused him to cut up some unusual capers, accompanied with such loud braying, that Zaby was again frightened out of his wits, and ran off as fast as he could, making his companion almost die with laughter at beholding him.</p>
               <p>The doctor, finding that his dagger infused such extraordinary life into his steed, ever and anon continued sticking him with it, until he at last succeeded in getting him into a clever trot, and concluded that the deadness and inactivity which the beast had first shown, sprung from nothing else but sheer laziness. In this brisk manner he proceeded about half a mile, enjoying his ride prodigiously; but such hard riding ill suited the poor ass, whose career was fast drawing to a close: for, what with the loss of blood from the doctor's cruel spur, and fatigue and starvation together, he was at length forced to succumb; and setting up a loud braying, he suddenly keeled over and yielded up the ghost. This movement of his steed, so sudden and unexpected, the doctor was not prepared for; and before he had time to extricate himself, he found that he was lying on the ground with the dead ass's body on the top of his leg, pinning him to the earth so that he could not rise; for, as we said before, he was very corpulent and unwieldy.</p>
               <p>He set up load and piteous cries, calling on Zaby to come and help him, for the situation he was in was most painful and uncomfortable. To these entreaties the fool turned a deaf ear, for he had not yet got over the fright with which the capers and loud brayings of the ass had inspired him.</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, doctor," cried he, "I dare scarcely look on the horrible beast, much less go near him; I know what those wild asses are: I've seen and heard enough of them; They are worse than lions any day; and I would rather meet a drove of mad dogs than encounter them."</p>
               <p>"True, true," answered the other; "but the ass is dead now, and can harm nobody."</p>
               <p>"I'm not so sure of that," returned Zaby; "he<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC5973-00000047"/> may be playing possum for all that I know; and while I'm lifting you up, may give me a kick on the head, and scatter my poor brains to the four winds."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Zaby," cried the doctor, "don't stand talking in that style! but come, my good fellow, and give me some assistance for heaven's sake! The ass, I tell you, is as dead as a herring."</p>
               <p>"Grant it," answered the fool; "and tell me, if you please, what's to hinder his coming to life again? You told me he had twelve war-horses in him; catch me going near such a monster. Even a cat has nine lives; and this is a hundred times bigger, and you can't deny it."</p>
               <p>The doctor's only answer to this appeal was a deep groan; and finding all further argument useless, he resigned himself to his fate as he best could, and was compelled to spend the night on the bare ground, exposed to the heavy dew, and with the weight of the ass's carcass resting on his leg.</p>
               <p>As for Zaby, he took the precaution of climbing a tree, being resolved, as he said, to keep out of harm's way and run no useless risks. It was not till morning that the doctor was relieved from his sufferings; and this deliverance he owed to some good-natured country people who happened to be passing on their way to market, and who kindly extricated him, and set him on his feet. Zaby, in the meantime, ventured to come down from his perch, and after receiving a scolding from his companion, the travelers pursued their journey.</p>
               <p>Continuing some miles further, they came to a small brook, where they halted to get a drink; and on stooping down, the doctor discovered among the pebbles at the bottom a large diamond. With great joy he snatched it up, thinking that he now had a prize which would enrich him, and abundantly repay him for the loss of his bag and all the other vexations of his journey. Zaby, too, was delighted; he took the jewel in his hand and closely examined it, holding it up to the light, smelling and tasting it. As sometimes is the case with such stones, it was partly incrusted with a slimy substance; and the doctor thought his friend's mouth would be no bad apparatus for washing it off.</p>
               <p>"Suck it, my dear, fellow," said he; "suck it as much as you like; it is quite harmless, and would not hurt you even if you swallowed it."</p>
               <p>"By heavens! I have swallowed it," exclaimed the fool.</p>
               <p>"Swallowed it!" cried the doctor. "Oh! Zaby, what a curse you are to me! what a marplot, what an evil genius, what an imp of darkness! Whatever possessed me to have you for a traveling companion!"</p>
               <p>"Why," exclaimed the other, "it won't hurt me."</p>
               <p>"No; but it will hurt me," answered the doctor.</p>
               <p>"Ten thousand rupees lost in a moment, just by carelessness<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC5973-00000048"/> lessness!—but perhaps it's not yet gone down; try and spit it out, for heaven's sake!" And so saying, he commenced thumping him on the back to make it bounce out.</p>
               <p>"It's no use, doctor," said the other; "it's all over with it; I feel it going down."</p>
               <p>"I fear so," returned his companion. "Yes, it's gone forever." But though he said this, he did not believe it; for he resolved when they reached Allahabad, which was now pretty near, that he would administer such a powerful emetic to his friend as would bring up the diamond at all hazards.</p>
               <p>They now proceeded on their journey, and about noon came to a small stream, where they halted to refresh themselves. They lay down on the bank, which was overgrown with luxuriant plants, and searched among them for fruits and berries. After some time the doctor discovered a fine pine-apple; and his companion inquired of him what it was, having never seen once before, as such fruit did not grow in the region whence they came.</p>
               <p>"It's a wild cabbage," replied the doctor, "and a very fine one, too. Eat it, Zaby, for there's no better vegetable grown;" and so saying, he wrenched off the green top and handed it to the other to eat, at the same time slipping the fruit under his robe, intending to regale himself with it at the first convenient opportunity.</p>
               <p>"Heavens!" cried Zaby, "what a little cabbage to have such a big stalk!" and so saying he commenced munching it.</p>
               <p>"How do you like it?" asked the doctor.</p>
               <p> "Oh," replied the other, "it's first rate; and if it were not so tasteless, and hard, and bitter, and prickly, and disagreeable, it would be uncommon fine eating."</p>
               <p>Having quenched their thirst at the brook, they rose up and jogged along, the doctor telling his friend to walk as fast as possible, as he was anxious to reach Allahabad before nightfall, as they then would have a better chance of getting good lodgings. But his real motive was to administer to Zaby the emetic, for the thought of his diamond had not been out of his mind for a moment; and he knew the longer the matter was delayed the less would be his chance of ever seeing it again. Accordingly he urged his companion to travel as fast as possible, to which he readily assented; and all was proceeding very prosperously till about the middle of the afternoon, when Zaby began to complain of the colic, brought on by the strange vegetable on which he had dined. He trudged along as well as he could, with both hands on his stomach, and with such a woful countenance that the doctor, with all the anxiety that weighed upon him, could scarce forbear laughing.</p>
               <p>"Come on, my good fellow," said he, "you will be well enough by and by. Allahabad is not far<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC5973-00000049"/> off, now, and when we arrive there we will have a good hot supper; that's what you want, after all, for your pains proceed from nothing else than an empty stomach."</p>
               <p>"It's no empty stomach," cried the fool; "it's that infernal cabbage you gave me for my dinner."</p>
               <p>"Why," said the doctor, "I thought you pronounced it rather fine eating."</p>
               <p>"It may be fine eating," continued the fool, "but it's not fine digesting, that I can assure you;" and here he burst out into the most lamentable groans. The other did all he could to soothe him, telling him to lean upon his arm; that he would soon be better; and that the place of their destination could not now be very distant. But Zaby's malady, instead of getting better, grew worse, till at length, notwithstanding all his friend's efforts to sustain him, he fell to the ground, declaring that he could not stir a step further.</p>
               <p>And now he broke out into the most dismal cries, upbraiding his companion for bringing him on such a cursed journey, and giving him such diabolical food to eat, so that it seemed altogether as if his last end was really approaching. As for the doctor, he knew not what to do: they were in the midst of a dreary place, night was drawing on, and the city still at some distance. It was evident that his comrade could not stir a single step, and he had now become so sick and tired of him, and was moreover so anxious to bring his weary pilgrimage to a termination and hurry forward to the town, that he had almost made up his mind to part company with his friend forever, and leave him to his fate, whatever it might be, whether to die of his complaint or to be devoured by wild beasts. And this he would most certainly have done without the least scruple or compunction, had it not been for one thing, and that was the fear of losing his diamond; which, as we said before, was never out of his mind, and which he was determined to save at all hazards. He therefore stooped down, and managed, though not without infinite trouble and labour, to lift up his companion and get him on his back, for he was now almost as helpless as a log of wood. The doctor, who was already half dead with fatigue, and whose little legs at the best could scarcely sustain his ample corporation, was almost bent double with the weight which he now had to carry. However he dragged along as he best could, uttering at every step the most pitiable groans, to which Zaby responded in strains still more pitiable, and which might have been heard almost a mile off.</p>
               <p>It would have melted a heart of stone to have witnessed the sad plight of this unfortunate couple, stumbling through the darkness over the dreary common, the one roaring with pain and the other with his back almost broken, and ready at every moment to fall dead with fatigue.</p>
               <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC5973-00000050"/>
               <p>It was near midnight when they reached Allahabad, and the doctor had just strength to arrive at the caravansary and enter the door, when a fit of faintness came over him, and he fell flat on the floor, with his comrade on top of him. By the kindness of the people of the house, and the use of proper means, they both gradually recovered; and the doctor lost no time in administering to Zaby the emetic, but without any good result, for the diamond failed to make its appearance; at which the former was sorely disappointed, and reviewing the calamities he had undergone from the outset of his journey, he came to the conclusion that all his cunning devices had signally failed, and that whatever might happen he would never hereafter travel with a fool.</p>

               <head>STORY OF ALDIBARAN.</head>
               <p>MANY years since, there reigned in Persia, a good king named Shah Abas, who was dethroned and put to death by an ambitious and unnatural brother. The late monarch left an only son, yet a child, who also came very near being destroyed, but was saved by the kindness and presence of mind of his father's prime minister and devoted friend, who eluded the cruelty of the usurper, and fled with the boy to a distant part of the empire. This worthy man then assumed the life of a hermit, taking up his abode in a cave among the mountains, and passed his time among his books and in the education of the young prince, who he hoped and believed would one day recover his lost rights and ascend the throne. He had taken the precaution when he fled to carry with him an abundance of wealth; and though he lived an austere life himself, he took care that the boy should be as well attended to as circumstances would permit, and that he should be in want of nothing that might conduce to his real welfare.</p>
               <p>In the same neighbourhood was a splendid castle, in which lived a powerful and renowned Emir, whose<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC5973-00000051"/> family consisted of an only daughter. The castle was often the scene of mirth and festivity, for, as its owner possessed great wealth and was of a kind and generous disposition, frequent visits were made to it by the neighbouring Emirs and nobles, who partook of its hospitality and indulged in the sports of hunting and hawking. The hermit was always a welcome guest at the establishment; his courtly manners and instructive conversation delighted the Emir, who often wondered what had induced a man of such accomplishments to retire as he had from the world, though he was too polite to question him as to his former life, or as to the motive that had impelled him to turn hermit. However, his visits to the Emir were rare; for, as we said before, he spent the greater part of his time in study and meditation, and in the instruction of his young companion, who grew up to manhood accomplished in body and mind, and a favourite with every one.</p>
               <p>Aldibaran, for so was he called, passed a great portion of his time at the castle, and began to be looked upon as part of the family; mingling in all the festivities and becoming acquainted with all the visitors who frequented its halls. The hermit was well pleased at this, and encouraged him in it; for as he confidently looked forward to the day when he should ascend the throne, he knew that such society would be of advantage to him, and assist in giving him that grace and demeanour which would be suitable to his future state. But nature, in this respect, had been bountiful to him, for he had an amenity of manner and sweetness of disposition which rendered him attractive to every one. This was heightened, too, by a certain dignity which sprung from a consciousness of his high rank, for his protector had early imparted to him the secret of his birth and royal title, impressing upon him, however, the importance of divulging it to no one.</p>
               <p>The Emir's daughter, also, by this time had grown to womanhood. Zelume, for such was her name, was distinguished for beauty and intelligence, and possessed, withal, so sweet a disposition that every one loved her. She was the idol of her father, who took a pride in making her acquainted with his numerous friends, and in beholding the effect which her rare loveliness and accomplishments produced; for wherever she went or with whomsoever she mingled she was without a rival. Such amiable traits were not lost on Aldibaran, who became strongly attached to her; nor was his love unrequited, for the young lady, who was thrown a good deal in his society, could not be insensible to his good qualities, and thus there grew up between them a mutual affection which the Emir and hermit both looked upon with complacency.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, the usurping king of Persia drew near his end. The crown which he had so wickedly gained had not brought with it much satisfaction; he had<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC5973-00000052"/> been hunted continually with remorse for his past crimes, and now, when about to die, a secret presentiment warned him that the throne was not to remain long in his family, but that the lost prince would some day return to reassert his rights and take vengeance on his wrong-doers. He, therefore, called his son, Shiraz, to his bed-side and thus spake:</p>
               <p>"My son," said he, "you know by what means it was that I became possessed of my crown, and it is needless to say any thing further on the subject; but I must tell you that when I made way with your uncle, it was my intention to have destroyed your cousin also, knowing that while he lived my throne would never be secure. I was defeated, however, in my design, by an old counsellor who fled with the child, and thus saved his life. I have made search for him these many years, but have never succeeded in finding him; yet certain I am that he is alive and that your authority will never be secure while this is the case, as I have a secret presentiment that he will appear and give you trouble. I have lately heard that the old counsellor, his protector, has taken the disguise of a hermit, and this may be of some use to you in finding out the prince's whereabouts; and the fact also of your cousin being precisely of the same age with yourself and bearing a strong resemblance to you. I know that you are wise and energetic; do not then lose a moment, but make diligent search throughout your dominions, and try to find out and destroy your most deadly foe.</p>
               <p>Soon after the old king died, and scarcely were the funeral rites over before Shiraz took measures to follow his father's advice. Having arranged his affairs, he put on the habit of a knight, and, unaccompanied by any one, made a journey over his territories. He was many months thus engaged, traveling from place to place and making inquiry of all persons who would be likely to give him any information as to the individuals he was in pursuit of. But for a long while his efforts were fruitless, yet he continued still to prosecute his search with unabated ardor.</p>
               <p>In the meanwhile things went on quietly and prosperously at the Emir's castle. The Emir attended to his affairs, and dispensed his usual hospitality to his friends, delighted above all at the happiness of his beloved daughter, and well pleased that she had placed her affections on so worthy an object; whilst the hermit spent his time chiefly in his cell, engaged in study and meditation.</p>
               <p>One afternoon, a little before sunset, the Emir and his daughter and Aldibaran were seated on the terrace enjoying the pleasant breeze from the mountains, and the beautiful and extensive view which the place afforded. Presently a horseman was seen approaching; he stopped at the gate, and sent a<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC5973-00000053"/> message by the porter to the Emir, asking him if he could give shelter till the next day to a weary traveler. The Emir, even at the distance he was at, perceived something noble in the air of the horseman, and proceeded to the gate to welcome him.</p>
               <p>"Sir," said he, embracing the stranger, "my castle and all it contains are welcome to you, not only for this one night, but for as long a time as you think proper to honour me with your company: this common hospitality would require at my hands; but I perceive in your appearance and demeanour something far more dignified than a common traveler, and, more than that, a striking resemblance to one of my dearest friends."</p>
               <p>The stranger started when he heard this, for it was Shiraz, the young king, in pursuit of his rival; however he soon recovered from his surprise, and thus returned answer:</p>
               <p>"My most worthy host," said he, "your beautiful palace is a fit residence for such a courtly and illustrious Emir, and I shall count it one of the happiest events of my life to have passed a night under your roof; but of this friend of whom you speak, pray tell me who is he, and where is he to be found, and is there a possibility of my seeing him?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing is easier," replied the other; "for yonder he sits on the terrace, conversing with my daughter; but come, follow me, and you shall soon be introduced to them both." So saying, he led the knight inside the castle and into the presence of Aldibaran and his daughter. They received him very cordially; and supper soon being served, they sat together conversing, and enjoying the pleasant summer evening.</p>
               <p>The stranger knight pleased them all by his intelligence and courtly manners, which showed that he was evidently a person of high rank. All were struck with the resemblance he bore to Aldibaran, with whom he became very intimate, putting to him many questions, and endeavouring to find out who he was. He became more and more impressed with the idea that it was his cousin, and congratulated himself that, after so much labour and research, he had now discovered him, and had him in his power. Their ages too were about the same; and Shiraz began, in as artful a manner as he could, to try to find out where he was born, and other matters of his former history. These questions the unsuspecting Aldibaran answered as fully as he could, though without revealing anything as to his royal birth; and told the stranger that his early life was involved in some mystery, as he had been brought to this part of the country, at a very tender age, under the care and protection of an old and valued friend, who now passed his life in the neighbourhood as a hermit.</p>
               <p>At the word hermit, Shiraz started; for he was now fully convinced that he had found the person he was in pursuit of, and resolved not to leave the<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC5973-00000054"/> castle till he had fullfilled the purpose of his journey, and his father's dying advice. He therefore told the young man that, among other studies, he had spent much of his youth in that of astrology; and that he intended to pass the night on one of the towers watching the stars, and would esteem it a great favour if he would honour him with his company. Aldibaran very graciously accepted the invitation, telling the stranger that nothing would afford him greater pleasure; and that he would meet him on the tower about midnight, for he had in the meanwhile a little business to attend to with his friend the hermit, which would not detain him long. The stranger now bid the company good night, and was escorted to the tower by one of the servants, and the Emir and his daughter retired to their apartments.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, Aldibaran proceeded to the hermit, whom he found waiting for him sitting by a lamp reading some papers. Having dispatched his business, he told the old man that the castle had been enlivened with the presence of a most courtly and agreeable knight, with whose society the Emir and his daughter, as well as himself, had been charmed; and what was most singular, that he was of the same age, and bore a striking resemblance to himself. He informed him further, that the stranger had retired to the battlements to watch the stars, and had exacted from him a promise to meet him there about midnight; and as the hour was now come, he was compelled to depart and join him.</p>
               <p>The hermit on hearing this turned pale, and begged his young friend to remain with him during the night, and, by no means, to have an interview with the stranger; "for, to tell you the truth," continued he, "I have a strong suspicion that this agreeable visitor is none other than your cousin, who has come here on purpose to destroy you. Take my advice, then, and do not enter the castle while he remains, much less trust yourself with him on the battlements."</p>
               <p>Aldibaran smiled at what he thought his friend's timidity, telling him he was sure his suspicions were misplaced; "besides," said he, "it would be cowardly in me to fear to meet a single man unattended; and having given him my word, I must stand by it at all hazards."</p>
               <p>"Very well," replied the hermit; "you may be right, and I may be wrong; but take this sword with you, and carry it concealed under your robe: it may be of use to you, and can do you at least no harm; and be sure to return to me as early in the morning as possible, and let me know all that has transpired."</p>
               <p>The young man took the weapon, and bidding his friend good evening, repaired to the appointed place. He found the stranger pacing the tower with an air of some impatience; he saluted him, remarking<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC5973-00000055"/> what a beautiful night it was, and with a smile inquired if the stars were auspicious.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied the other, sternly; "to me they are auspicious, for the very hour has arrived when I am to become rid of a hated enemy and rival—the disturber of my father's peace and the plotter against my throne. I am Shiraz, king of Persia, and thou I know art Aldibaran: ask Allah, then, to pardon thy sins, for by this good sword that I now draw thy last hour has come."</p>
               <p>"It is true," replied the youth, "that I am Aldibaran, but wherein I have injured thee I know not; but this I know, that thy father slew mine, and deprived him of his throne, seeking, too, for many years, to take my life also; but, notwithstanding all this, I bear no malice to his son, and am still willing to be at peace with thee, especially as thou art our guest, whom it is my duty to shield and protect."</p>
               <p>"Protect!" cried the other, "what protection need I from one whom I have in my power, and whose last hour is come?" and so saying he made a thrust at Aldibaran, who slipped aside and eluded the weapon, at the same time throwing off his robe and drawing his own sword.</p>
               <p>They fought for some time desperately, and Shiraz, making one last effort, rushed on his foe, and, receiving the blade in his heart, fell dead. Aldibaran then hastily descended from the tower, and proceeded to the cell of the hermit, who had not yet retired to rest.</p>
               <p>"My father," said he, "you were right about that stranger: he has turned out to be the person you took him for."</p>
               <p>"And pray," replied the other, "what was the object of the interview he sought with you? What did he want?"</p>
               <p>"He wanted my life!" answered the youth, "and has lost his own, which I was compelled to take in self-defense."</p>
               <p>"And is he then dead?" said the old man.</p>
               <p>"Yes," returned the other, "he lies on the top of yonder battlement drenched in his blood."</p>
               <p>"Then," said the hermit, "the hour of thy deliverance is at last come, and you will soon resume the position you are truly entitled to, and of which you have been so long and unjustly deprived. Go now to the Emir's stables and mount one of his fleetest horses; set off with all speed for Ispahan; show this signet ring to the vizier: tell him that Shiraz, the young king, is dead, that the old minister still lives, and that thou art Aldibaran. He is your friend, and will tell you what to do; but be careful to return and report to me as soon as possible; be back in ten days at the utmost."</p>
               <p>The young man kissed the hermit, and promised faithfully to fulfil all his directions; and proceeding<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC5973-00000056"/> at once to the stables he mounted one of the swiftest steeds, and started for the capital.</p>
               <p>In the morning the Emir and his daughter were up early to enjoy the pleasant society of the stranger; but after waiting a considerable time and finding he did not appear, they sent a servant to call him. Great was their surprise and horror when news came that the young knight was lying dead on the tower, slain by some unknown hand.</p>
               <p>The Emir's grief and anger were unbounded. "Who can this assassin be," said he, "who had dared to kill a guest of mine—one whom it was my duty to protect the moment he crossed my threshold, and to defend whom I was bound to lay down my own life, if necessary? But he shall be revenged; for no pains nor cost shall be spared till the murderer be found out, and punished as he deserves." Diligent search was made, but no clue was seen by which the criminal could be discovered, though it was soon known that Aldibaran was missing; and that the weapon by which the bloody deed had been committed belonged to him. Suspicion, of course, fastened! upon him, and though the idea of such a thing was most painful to the Emir, yet he could not shut his eyes to facts, and swore he would bring the perpetrator to justice; for the scared rites of hospitality had been invaded, and the criminal, if found guilty, should die, even if he were his own son.</p>
               <p>The beautiful Zelume was in despair: she besought her father with tears to moderate his wrath and be patient: certainly there was some mistake; the young man would soon return, and explain all, for whatever were the proofs against him she was sure that Aldibaran was innocent.</p>
               <p>"If he be innocent," cried the Emir, "why has he fled? and tell me, I pray, what is the meaning of this bloody sword?"</p>
               <p>To this his daughter could make no answer, but retired to her chamber to weep.</p>
               <p>In the meantime horseman had been dispatched in all directions in search of Aldibaran, but no traces of him were to be found, and Zelume's faith in his innocence began to waver, and every hour of his absence added to her apprehension and augmented her distress. She knew not who to look to for comfort; her father's rage against her lover was so intense that she almost feared to speak to him, and every one in the castle naturally partook of his feelings more or less, so that she seemed as it were to stand alone as the friend and confident of one who was regarded by all as a detested criminal. She resolved to go to the hermit to see whether he could, give her any comfort, or impart to her any thing that might tend to clear up the mystery. She accordingly set out for his cell, and found him sitting calmly in front of his abode engaged in meditation.</p>
               <p>"Good hermit," said she, "tell us where is Aldibaran<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC5973-00000057"/> baran, for you are his friend, and must certainly know whither he has gone."</p>
               <p>"It is true," replied the old man, "that I am his friend; and that I also know whither he has gone; but I cannot at present reveal it."</p>
               <p>"Tell me at least," continued the lady, "whether he is the murderer of this unhappy stranger."</p>
               <p>"No," said the other, "Aldibaran is no murderer, nor did he ever in his life inflict wrong on any one."</p>
               <p>"Thanks," replied Zelume, "for what you have told me; you have taken a heavy weight from my heart."</p>
               <p>The old man rose up and took her by the hand. "Return to thy home in peace," said he; "be patient and put thy trust in Heaven; for if I read thy destiny aright much happiness is yet in store for thee."</p>
               <p>The young lady bedewed the hermit's hand with her tears, and returning in silence to the castle, retired to her apartment.</p>
               <p>The persons who had been sent in search of Aldibaran, now arrived, but no tidings of him were discovered; whereupon the Emir, believing that the hermit was an accomplice in the bloody deed, gave orders that he should be apprehended and put to death. The old man told the Emir not to be hasty nor give way to his anger in thus punishing the innocent, for he was confident, if he would only be patient, that the young, man would appear in a very short time, and show how greatly he had been wronged by their unjust suspicions.</p>
               <p>"It is now," said he, "five days since Aldibaran has disappeared, if he does not return in five days more, I am willing to pay the penalty and suffer in his stead."</p>
               <p>"Be it so," replied the Emir, "I will take thee at thy word;" whereupon the hermit was placed in confinement.</p>
               <p>Zelume passed nearly all her time on the tower, straining her eyes and looking in all directions for some sign of her lover appearing. When she thought of the danger the good old man was in, and that if the time should elapse and Aldibaran not appear, that he would have to die, she was overwhelmed with sorrow; but the hopeful words he had spoken to her at their last interview still cheered her up, and she believed that he would not have specified to the Emir a fixed time for her lover's arrival, unless he had some good grounds for doing so.</p>
               <p>Time soon slipped by, and the tenth day arrived; but, as yet, there was no appearance of Aldibaran. Zelume stood on the tower looking upon the distant horizon, and on the battlements were the Emir with, his friends and retainers, all anxiously gazing. About sunset he gave orders to have the hermit brought out to undergo his sentence; a rope was round his neck, and he was to be hung from the<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC5973-00000058"/> castle wall as a terror to evil doers, and a propitiatory sacrifice to violated hospitality. Hundreds of eyes were fastened on the old man, and all wondered at the firmness he displayed.</p>
               <p>Suddenly, among the mountains, were heard the strains of distant music; every one looked in the direction from which it proceeded, and a vast army was now seen defiling into the plain, with streamers and bright armour.</p>
               <p>"Who can this powerful foe be?" said the gazers, "who thus unexpectedly invades us?"</p>
               <p>"This music," answered the Emir, "is not that of a warlike host; it is soft and pleasant, such as belongs to a gay procession or joyous festival."</p>
               <p>The army now covered the plain and approached the castle; and from the front ranks there rode forth a figure of commanding appearance, mounted on a beautiful steed, with a standard-bearer by his side.</p>
               <p>"Mark the chief," said the lookers-on; "we will now know what all this means and who this noble stranger is."</p>
               <p>"'Tis Aldibaran!" cried Zelume.</p>
               <p>"'Tis Aldibaran!" cried a hundred voices on the battlements; and all appealed to the hermit to know if it were not so.</p>
               <p>"'Tis the king of Persia," answered the old man; "see, the royal standard is unrolled, and let all present do it homage;" whereupon shouts upon shouts rent the air.</p>
               <p>The Emir and his friends now descended to the gate and prostrated themselves before Aldibaran; for he it truly was, who, on reaching Ispahan, had succeeded in regaining his crown without difficulty, and was now returned to explain every thing and claim his beloved Zelume. Their marriage was celebrated that night amid great rejoicings and festivities, and after spending a few days at the castle, they returned in triumph to the capital, where they reigned happily many years; the hermit being reinstated in his old post of prime minister.</p>

               <head>STORY OF AMOY THE BOASTER.</head>
               <p>IN a certain province of China, there once lived a very wise and powerful king. He had reigned long and happily and seemed to prosper in every thing he undertook, so that he got the name of the Fortunate. When he found his end approaching he called his son, Amoy, to his bedside, and thus addressed him:—"My son," said he, "you see what a happy life I have led and how I have prospered in all my plans; this success the world had ascribed to my superior wisdom and prudence; but this is all a mistake, and I am now about to tell you the true secret of it. Many years ago I rendered an important service to a powerful genii, who, in return, promised me his favor and protection during life, on one condition, and that was—<emph>never to utter a boast</emph> I most carefully followed this advice, and you see with what success; if in your turn you do the same, the same good fortune will accompany you; but if you disregard it your good luck will instantly vanish, and you will be plunged in the greatest misery." Having thus spoken, the old king soon after died, universally lamented, and Prince Amoy ascended the throne.</p>
               <p>For a long while he followed his father's advice very carefully, and not only never uttered a boast, but made it a rule not to speak about himself at all; "for then," said he, "I will be sure of not breaking the charm." But gradually the pleasures and flattery with which he was surrounded began to corrupt him, and he became less careful of his conduct than he was at first.</p>
               <p>One day he was out hunting and met a procession of priests with lanterns and flags, going to a festival of Buddha, which was held in a josshouse some distance off. The king's companions wished him to halt till the retinue had passed; this he would not do, but dashed through it, throwing it all into disorder. The old priest gently chid him for his breach of decorum, telling him what a bad example he was setting to his subjects, and how differently he behaved from his father, who always respected religion and honoured its ministers. This rebuke threw Amoy into a violent passion.</p>
               <p>"Insolent priest," cried he, "how dare you speak thus to your lord and master?"</p>
               <p>The words were scarcely out of his mouth when he fell senseless from his horse; and, on recovering, found himself lying on the ground in a wild and unknown country. He looked round in astonishment, wondering where he was and how he got<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC5973-00000060"/> there; at length he remembered that he had not followed his father's advice, but had broken the charm on which his happiness depended by uttering a boast.</p>
               <p>"How foolishly I acted," said he, "in not waiting a moment for the procession to pass, and how unmannerly I behaved in insulting the old priest, who did nothing more than his duty when he reproved me; however, I will endeavour to make amends for my folly in future, and perhaps the genii, for my father's sake, will favour me." He now rose up and began to look about for some habitation, and after wandering a few miles came to a house which seemed to be occupied by herdsmen. Being very hungry he knocked at the door and asked for food and shelter. The master of the house, whose name was Kiang, received him kindly, setting before him the best he had, and at night provided him with a straw pallet where he slept very comfortably.</p>
               <p>After remaining here a few days, Kiang thus addressed him: "My son," said he, "I have given you food and shelter, because I saw you needed it; but it is not proper that one so strong and healthy as you should eat the bread of idleness; tell me, therefore, what kind of work you can do, that I may give you employment among the rest of my men."</p>
               <p>Amoy, who was fearful of uttering a boast, replied that he was acquainted with no art nor trade whatever, but was as ignorant as a bat.</p>
               <p>"You can take charge of a small flock of sheep I have," said Kiang.</p>
               <p>"Alas!" replied the prince, "I have not the skill to tend a lamb, much less a flock of sheep."</p>
               <p>"Take, then, this ox-horn," answered the herdsman, "and go to yonder wood, and blow it all day, to keep off the wolves which infest this neighbourhood."</p>
               <p>The young man said he would try; and, taking up the horn, went to the forest. He pursued his task several days; but finding, it rather a tedious one, he thought it would be much better to destroy the wolves if he could, than to waste his time in scaring them off. He accordingly cut down a sapling, and forming it into a bow, set out in pursuit of the beasts. Being an expert archer, his efforts proved successful; and in a few days he killed and drove away all the wolves. This exploit gained him great credit with Kiang and all the herdsmen, who lavished on him many favours; the prince being all the while very careful of keeping his vow, and not uttering a boast.</p>
               <p>It happened about this time that the chief mandarin of the province gave a great feast to all his captains and head-men. A grand trial was also to be given to all persons skilled in archery. The match was held on the bank of a river a few miles from Kiang's residence. Here tents were set up, and a beautiful entertainment prepared for the people,<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC5973-00000061"/> who flocked to it from a great distance. At the desire of Kiang, Amoy repaired to the meeting to try his skill at shooting. The mark was stuck up on the bank of the river. The archers took their stands; and though they all showed great skill, yet none of them struck the target exactly in the centre. It now came to the prince's turn; and as he had not uttered a boast, he felt pretty sure the genii would befriend him. And so it happened; for his arrow struck the mark precisely in the centre, and, going through it, fell on the opposite side of the river. A shout of applause followed this specimen of skill; and the mandarin, coming up, embraced him kindly, and told him he should be captain of his archers.</p>
               <p>"There is only one thing I regret," continued he, "and that is the loss of the arrow; for I should like above all things to see the arrow that strikes so accurately; but I do not see how I can get it, as we have no boat, and the stream is too deep to ford."</p>
               <p>"It is a mere brook," said the prince; "but if it were ten times as wide, I would swim across it." With these words, he threw off his cap and sprung into the water.</p>
               <p>But he had miscalculated his strength; for the current was strong and rapid, and carried him down with a force he could not resist. He caught at the branches of the trees to stop himself, but all was in vain; and now, exhausted and senseless, he resigned himself to his fate. While death thus stared him in the face, he suddenly opened his eyes, and found himself on the sea-shore, lying on a sand-bank near the mouth of a river.</p>
               <p>He now recollected that he had broken the charm by uttering a boast, and was, in consequence, suffering the penalty. In a little while he spied a vessel at some distance; and making a signal of distress with his handkerchief, rejoiced to find it was steering towards him. The ship came as near the shore as it could; and Amoy waded out, and climbed into it. The sailors gathered round him, asking him who he was, and how he had got into such an out-of-the-way place. He was so humbled with his misfortunes, that he hardly ventured to speak. At length he told them he was a poor, miserable wretch, and that he scarcely knew where he was, or what he was about; and when the men wished to put him to some work, he told them he was unable to do it, being utterly unfit for any thing. The sailors seeing him behave in this strange way, concluded he was a madman; and thinking his presence might bring some harm to the ship, picked him up, and, without any ceremony, cast him into the sea.</p>
               <p>The vessel chanced at that moment to be passing over a bed of pearls; and as the prince struck the bottom, he grasped some of them in his hands, and then rose to the top of the water with both hands full of them. The men were astonished and overjoyed at such a singular sight, and hastily drew<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC5973-00000062"/> Amoy into the ship; and now their minds were suddenly changed towards him, for they looked upon him as some wonderful being highly favoured by heaven. They cast anchor, and began fishing for pearls; and having procured as many as they desired, they proceeded on their course, in high spirits. They paid great deference to the prince, regarding him as the cause of their good luck; and told him that their vessel should be under his control, and that they would be governed by his advice in all their plans. He advised them to steer for Nankin, which was the capital of his empire; and told them when they arrived there, he would show them what to do to bring their rich cargo to the best market. In a few weeks they reached Nankin, and the prince went ashore to reconnoiter.</p>
               <p>He proceeded at once to the palace, and sought an interview with his old faithful vizier, who joyfully recognized him. The vizier told him that they had all been sadly perplexed to account for his sudden disappearance; and that he had sent messengers into all the adjacent countries to search him out, and that he in the meantime had governed the kingdom, being resolved however to restore it to the rightful owner whenever he appeared. He informed him, moreover, that his cousin Alkayah had unceasingly tormented him to bestow the crown upon him as the next heir; and as all hope of the prince's return seemed to be lost, he had promised to do so if the young king did not appear at the expiration of a certain time, which was now drawing near. He told the prince also that his cousin, by the liberal use of money, had made himself very popular in the city; and that it would require much good management, and the lavishing of large sums, to defeat him. He added, too, that it was absolutely necessary for him to remain unknown for the present, and trust the conduct of the business to him. This good advice the young king eagerly embraced, informing the vizier of the vast treasure he had in the ship, the whole of which, if necessary, he would expend in regaining his throne. He next went and explained to the sailors who he was, telling them that if they assisted him, he would confer great dignities upon them when he regained his rights. The sailors joyfully embraced the proposal; and the prince, having hired a house near the palace, made use of his riches in the way the vizier had recommended. A large party was formed in his favour, headed by all the chief mandarins and officers; and so well had the vizier managed things, that a day was fixed, upon which at sunrise the long-lost prince was to be proclaimed king—it being the same day on which Alkayah also expected that his claim to the kingdom would be acknowledged: he having no suspicion whatever of Amoy's arrival, and knowing nothing of the schemes that were going forward.</p>
               <p>The eventful day now approached, and on the evening previous Alkayah gave a splendid feast to<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC5973-00000063"/> all his friends in honour of his approaching greatness.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile Amoy's party had all things arranged, the prince putting on the royal robes the night before so as to be prepared to mount the throne at daybreak. From the windows of his chamber he saw the house of Alkayah lighted up, and heard the sound of music and revelry. To while away the time he disguised himself in a cloak, and crossing the street, entered the banquet hall, and mingled with the guests. Elated with joy at the prospect of soon regaining his throne, he was in high spirits, and indulged freely in the tempting wines and liquors, which made him somewhat talkative and noisy. Alkayah, displeased at seeing a stranger behaving in so disorderly a manner, gave him a gentle rebuke, which threw the prince into a towering passion.</p>
               <p>"Insolent usurper!" cried he, "how dare you speak thus to your master and king!" and at the same time throwing off his cloak, displayed himself in his true character, with all the signs of royalty.</p>
               <p>But his triumph was short; for when Alkayah found that the long-lost king was in his power, he drew his sword, and calling on his friends to assist him in getting rid of his enemy and rival, they all rushed upon the unfortunate prince and soon dispatched him.</p>
               <p>Thus perished poor Amoy the Boaster.</p>

               <head>STORY OF THE GOLDEN BUCK AND GREEDY HUNTER.</head>
               <p>I AM now an old man, poor and miserable, with the snows of ninety winters resting on my head; yet, wretched and poverty-stricken as I am, I once had the chance of attaining boundless riches, and would have certainly possessed them, but for my cursed folly and avarice. Yet I do not by any means blame Providence for its dealings towards me; but, on the contrary, am convinced that all has happened for the best; for if the mere sight and expectation of riches caused me to act in such an unbecoming manner, how should I have behaved had I actually possessed them? Would I not have done things which would have brought upon me much pain and trouble, and perhaps have ended in my destruction? And indeed this is the common fate of those who are raised to sudden affluence, and providence in this way tries their tempers and dispositions, and deals with them accordingly. A man is suddenly, by some freak of fortune, placed in possession<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC5973-00000064"/> session of wealth. If he demeans himself in a proper manner, not suffering himself to be intoxicated by his good luck, his prosperity will often abide with him during life; but if, on the contrary, as usually happens, he becomes proud and uplifted, breaking out into wild and fantastic actions, his wealth is suddenly taken from him, and he is suffered to relapse into that condition in which he can do least harm to himself or others. But it is time for me to stop this moralizing, and go on with my story.</p>
               <p>Sixty years ago, I was a strong, active young man, and passed the greater part of my time in hunting, by which means I was able to gain a tolerable livelihood. I lived then in that part of China bordering on Thibet, where the country is wild and mountainous. I was out one day hunting chamois, and had wandered farther from home than I had ever done before. I found myself inclosed in a valley, with step cliffs rising on each side; the ground was strewn in every part with stones and rocks of all sizes and shapes. I threaded my way among them, not without some difficulty, looking with wonder at the strange scene they presented. The sun was now set, and I was somewhat out of heart, having met with no game of any description. I was also tired and hungry, and being a long distance from home, was beginning to seek a place of rest for the night.</p>
               <p>All at once I saw a fine buck crossing the valley. I let fly an arrow, and struck him in the breast, whereupon the animal fell dead. Greatly overjoyed I ran up to secure the prize, when suddenly there stepped from behind the rocks an old man, in tattered garments.</p>
               <p>"That buck is mine," cried he.</p>
               <p>"You are mistaken," I replied, "for I just now shot it myself."</p>
               <p>"I, too, shot it," said the stranger, "and you will find my arrow sticking in its side."</p>
               <p>"Very true," answered I, "but your arrow, you see, hit it only on the flank, giving it but a slight hurt, whilst mine struck it in the heart, inflicting a death wound."</p>
               <p>"You are right," exclaimed the old man; and striking his hand on his forehead he commenced weeping.</p>
               <p>"Why do you weep, father?" said I, "you see it was I who killed the buck, and am fairly entitled to it."</p>
               <p>"I know it, I know it," replied the other; "but if you knew my case you would not wonder at my weeping; for I have at home five small children; their mother is dead, and they are without food; two days have I hunted without success, and nothing is left for me now but to lie down and die, for I cannot return home and see my children starving."</p>
               <p>"Your children shall not starve," said I, "take the buck, my father, and carry it at once to your<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC5973-00000065"/> household;" whereupon I lifted up the animal and placed it on his shoulders.</p>
               <p>"My son," returned he, grasping my hand, "I did not expect this; I can say no more; but heaven will not suffer such virtue to go unrewarded;" and with these words he stepped behind the rocks and disappeared.</p>
               <p>Thus was I very unexpectedly deprived of the fruit of my day's labour, yet I did not by any means regret what I had done, but on the contrary felt that inward satisfaction and gaiety of spirit which always accompanies good deeds. With a light and merry heart I looked forward to the morrow, hoping that there was still good luck in store for me. I now searched for a place of repose, and selected a stone which was as square and smooth as if it had been hewn with a chisel. I threw myself on the block, and was about to fall asleep, when I suddenly heard beneath me soft music, and felt the stone gradually sinking. I was greatly alarmed at this, not knowing what to make of it, and after descending to a considerable distance, I found that the stone ceased moving.</p>
               <p>An intolerable flood of light now burst upon me, causing me to open my eyes, which I had hitherto kept closed, not venturing to open them, for fear of seeing something that might terrify me still more. But now the dazzling scene forced itself upon me, and I found myself in a vast apartment, the roof and walls of which were formed of spars that glittered like icicles, with thousands of lights interspersed among them, making the place as bright as day.</p>
               <p>In the centre of this vast hall, seated round a table, were a company of gnomes dressed in white, each with a wreath of diamonds on his brow. They were drinking from gold cups, and at first did not appear to take any notice of me, of which I was very glad, for I hoped that the great distance I was from them, would prevent them from discovering me. But in this I was mistaken, for in a little while they all turned their eyes to the spot where I was, and one of them, who seemed to be their chief, thus addressed me:</p>
               <p>"Young man," said he, "be not surprised at what you behold, for know that the valley into which you wandered to-day is the country of the gnomes, and every foot of it is enchanted ground. The old man you met was none other than myself. I put on that shape to try whether you mortals are as avaricious as fame reports you to be. I was well pleased with your behaviour, and intend now to reward it. Tomorrow you will meet in the valley a prize, which will enrich you forever. But remember, I give it to you on one condition, and that is, you must take it at once and begone from this place, for if you fail to do this, your prize will immediately vanish from your grasp."</p>
               <p>Having thus said, he motioned to one of his companions<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC5973-00000066"/> panions, who brought and handed me a cup of wine, which I drank off, and fell into a profound sleep, from which I did not awake till the next morning, when I found myself in the valley, lying on the block, with the sun shining upon me.</p>
               <p>I rose up and sat a long while musing on what had happened during the night. Could it have been a dream, thought I; no, for it was quite too vivid for a dream; besides, I knew that I was wide awake when I first heard the music, and felt the stone move; yet where is that magnificent hall, and who were those beautiful creatures that I saw? I cannot comprehend; I must, I suppose, call it a dream, as I cannot otherwise account for it; yet certainly it was the strangest and most like reality of any I ever experienced. I now picked up my bow and arrows, and prepared for my day's labour.</p>
               <p>As I walked up the valley, I came to a rude trap of wicker work, which I had constructed the afternoon before, having heard that such rocky places were sometimes inhabited by ermines. This is a small animal whose skin is of immense value, and though I had set a trap for them, it was more to pass away the time that I did so than with any expectation of catching them. Judge then my astonishment, when, on looking into the trap, I found it literally filled up with these precious creatures piled on top of one another. "My fortune is made," exclaimed I, clapping my hands with joy; "but where in the world did they all come from; certainly the valley is full of them. I must make hay while the sun shines, and not do things by halves." So saying I pulled out my knife, and cutting down a parcel of twigs, I set to work in great haste and constructed another trap larger than the first. I then retired a good distance off, and spent the whole day in congratulating myself on my good luck.</p>
               <p>As sunset approached, I thought it time to see what I had caught, and quietly approaching the place, I gently lifted up the box, but was surprised at finding nothing in it. "This is strange," said I; "but what matters it; I have got already enough for my purpose, and can live like a nabob, and what does a man want more than that." I now quietly lifted up my first trap, and to my utter amazement, found it also empty; not an ermine was to be seen. I was mad with vexation at this disappointment, and my last night's adventure flashed over my mind. "Ah," said I, "is not this the very thing the gnome king told me, when he warned me that I must at once take up my prize and begone, and now by not heeding his advice, and giving way to a covetous disposition I have lost all. Perhaps I may see the gnomes again to-night, and have a chance afforded me of retrieving my error."</p>
               <p>So saying I went back to the rock and laid down on it just as I did the night before. I listened attentively to hear the music, and in about an hour<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC5973-00000067"/> it commenced, and I felt the stone sinking. In a few moments I found myself again in the vast hall with the gnomes sitting round their table. In a little while the king turned towards me, and thus spoke:</p>
               <p>"Young man," said he, "you acted foolishly today in showing so avaricious a spirit, and in not obeying the advice I gave you, but in consideration of your youth, we will forgive your fault this time, and give you another chance. To-morrow you will meet with a prize more valuable than the first, but remember the condition: you must take it up at once and begone, for if you fail to do this, you will most certainly lose it." He then motioned to one of his companions, who rose up and handed me a cup of wine, which I drank off, and presently fell into a profound sleep, from which I did not wake till the next morning, when I found myself on the block, with the sun shining upon me.</p>
               <p>I sprung up in high spirits, and begun hunting for my prize, searching every nook and corner, and lifting up the big stones, till my back fairly ached. I went on in this way, moving a considerable distance up the valley, and as hour after hour passed, and nothing appeared, I grew disheartened, and began to think the gnomes were deceiving me, or that after all the whole thing was a dream. A little after noon-day I reached a small rivulet, which wandered through the grass and emptied into a sort of pool, or basin. Being heated with my walk, and very thirsty, I threw myself on the ground to take a drink, and on looking into the basin was surprised to find that it swarmed with fish, and of a kind I had never seen before; for they were of a bright red colour, and transparent as glass. I plunged my hand in the pool, and drew one out, and what was my amazement on discovering that it was a beautiful ruby, of a fish-like form.</p>
               <p>I held it up to the sun and beheld it with delight. "Ah," said I, "my fortune is made now; what will the jewellers say to rubies like this? Truly the crown of China cannot equal it; but only see what a lot of them; I must take another haul, that's certain, for 'twas I that discovered them, and by good rights they all belong to me." So saying, I dipped my cap in the stream, and drawing up a shoal of them emptied them on the bank; when, to my astonishment, I found they were nothing but fish of a reddish colour. They frisked about so that I could not hold them, till they all, at length, jumped into the pool; but the worst of it was, my beautiful ruby got mixed among them, and catching the contagion leaped into the water with the others, in spite of all my efforts to prevent it, nor did I ever see it again.</p>
               <p>I now remembered what the gnomes had told me, and how I had again broken their command. I lay on the ground and cried with vexation, saying:<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC5973-00000068"/> "Alas, my beautiful ruby, I shall see you again no more; alas, my beautiful ruby!"</p>
               <p>It was by this time pretty late in the afternoon, and I resolved to trespass on the kindness of the gnomes once more; being determined, if they should favour me with another trial, that I would obey their instructions this time to the very letter. I had a long distance to walk, and it was some time after dark before I reached the stone, when I threw myself upon it expecting again to hear the music; nor was I disappointed; for in a little while the sounds commenced and the block began to descend, and presently I found myself transported to the hall of the gnomes. They were seated as usual, round their table drinking, and after a few moments the king turned round and addressed me. This time he spoke somewhat sternly.</p>
               <p>"Foolish youth," said he, "what madness possesses you? Twice have you had the chance of attaining boundless riches, and twice has your avaricious disposition got the better of you and been your ruin. Out of pity for you we will give you one more chance, and that shall be the last. To-morrow you will meet with a prize more valuable than you have seen yet; but remember the condition on which it is given to you: you must take it up at once and begone from this valley; beware, then, how you disobey, for this is your last chance," He then motioned to his companion, who brought me a cup of wine, which I drank off, and fell into a deep sleep, from which I did not awake till the next morning, when I found myself lying on the block with the sun shining upon me.</p>
               <p>I sprang up and commenced hunting for my treasure, looking in every nook and corner and wandering about in all directions. But my efforts were fruitless; nothing but stones, rocks, and brambles were to be seen. I dug in the ground, groped among the crevices, and almost dislocated my shoulder in attempting to overturn some of the huge blocks. But all was in vain; and, as hour after hour passed, and the sun reached the meridian and began fast to descend, I sat down tired and exhausted, determined to search no more.</p>
               <p>"If," said I, "what the gnomes told me is true, and I am destined to posess such a prize, it will come to me just as well sitting still as seeking for it."</p>
               <p>I waited in this manner a considerable time, but all in vain; and as it was now past sunset, I lost all patience, and seizing my weapons I started up for home. "I will go back to the mountains," said I, "and hunt chamois, nor will I ever approach this valley again, for from my first coming here I have met with nothing but loss and disappointment."</p>
               <p>The words were hardly out of my mouth, when a beautiful buck jumped from behind the rocks. I let fly an arrow with all my might, and struck him<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC5973-00000069"/> on the flank; when, instead of blood, there issued from the wound a stream of gold coin. The buck bounded along with the gold spouting from his side, leaving behind him, as he went, a shining path of the precious metal. I followed after him, exclaiming as I ran: "What a buck is this!—the goose that laid golden eggs is nothing to him—I'll be his owner if I run till doomsday."</p>
               <p>The animal proceeded with great speed to the side of the valley, where was a little cavern or crevice in the rocks, into which he darted and I after him. I thought now that I had him for certain, for I knew that the cave was of small dimensions and had no outlet. I groped about with my hands, and soon discovered that there was no buck there, though where he had gone to I could not, for the life of me, conceive.</p>
               <p>"No matter," said I, "I've gold enough; much more, I'm afraid, than I can shovel up;" so I stepped out of the chasm, but was thunderstruck at finding that the coin had all disappeared. "Oh, cursed avarice!" exclaimed I, "what fools you make of us; <emph>instead of chasing the buck I should have picked up the gold.</emph> Thrice have I disobeyed the gnomes and ruined myself; but I will go and try them once more; entreating them to grant me whatever they see fit; for I will this time thankfully receive from them the smallest favour, and submit to any penalty they may impose."</p>
               <p>With this idea I hurried back to the block, and as it was now nightfall I threw myself upon it, composing myself as quietly as possible. I listened attentively for the music, and expected every moment that the stone would descend, but I was doomed to disappointment; for I lay the whole night beneath the open sky, with the stars shining upon me, nor did I ever see the gnomes any more.</p>
               <p>I arose in the morning lamenting my bad luck, and cursing the authors of it; but as my passions cooled and reason resumed her sway, I gradually began to see that the real author of it was myself, and that I was the one to blame for all the misfortunes that had happened to me. Filled with such reflections, I picked up my bow and arrows, and with a heavy heart bended my steps homeward.</p>

               <head>STORY OF LASCAR AND NOURILLA.</head>
               <p>IN the southern part of the province of Yunnana, in China, there once stood an old castle. It was build on a high hill which sloped down to a valley, at one end of which was a small town or village. This massive building, which had been erected in some remote age, was of vast size and strength, its interior being a perfect labyrinth. It was occupied by a person called Zingallah, who styled himself governor of the village, but who was, in truth, its tyrant and the terror of the whole neighbourhood. He seemed to take a delight in tormenting all within his reach; and if he saw any one rich or prosperous he was sure to oppress him and generally ended by stripping him of the greater part of his possessions. Sometimes, surrounded by his guards, he would visit the town, and if he saw any thing there that pleased him he would first offer for it some contemptible price, and if refused made no scruple of seizing it. On these occasions the villagers would gladly have closed their shops, but this he would not permit; telling them that he did not come to interrupt their business, but only to look at them and see how they were getting on. Being thus universally hated, it may be readily imagined that the people would gladly have rid themselves of him by any means whatever; and such, indeed was the case; but all such attempts had been so soon discovered and so terribly punished, that every one now was almost afraid to speak of him, much less to undertake his destruction.</p>
               <p>In the same village lived a wealthy farmer named Wang, who was in all respects the opposite of Zingallah. He was generous and benevolent, and used his riches in such a way as to gain the esteem and affection of every one. This worthy man had an only daughter named Nourillah—an amiable and beautiful young lady, the delight of her father and of all who were acquainted with her. She had just reached womanhood, and had been recently betrothed, with the approbation of her relations, to a young shepherd named Lascar, who was in all respects worthy of her hand. A time for the marriage of the young couple was now in contemplation, and every thing looked bright, when all at once their happiness was marred by an event that threw them all into the greatest consternation.</p>
               <p>It happened that Zingallah, in one of his visits to the town, saw Nourillah sitting at the door of her father's house. At first sight he fell deeply in love with her, and resolved to lose not a moment in securing her hand. He therefore sent a messenger to her<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC5973-00000071"/> father loaded with rich presents, declaring that he had conceived a warm affection for his daughter, and demanding her in marriage.</p>
               <p>This unexpected proposal threw Wang into the greatest perplexity, and he was at a loss what answer to make. However, he thought it best to be candid with the governor, and let him know exactly how the matter stood. He accordingly sent back the man, bidding him to tell his master how highly honoured he felt himself in the governor's seeking an alliance with his daughter; but as the young lady was already betrothed to a young man named Lascar, in all respects worthy of her, it would be impossible under present circumstances to comply with his flattering proposal.</p>
               <p>This unexpected reply threw Zingallah into a violent passion, and he felt at first disposed to wreak his vengeance on poor Lascar; but on considering the matter, he thought it beneath his dignity to take notice of a contemptible shepherd, and resolved if he were thwarted in his wishes that the whole village should suffer for it. With this determination he sent back the messenger: telling him to declare to Wang that it was useless to attempt to cross his desires; and that if his daughter did not consent to marry him in three days, he would come and carry her off by force, and give orders to his soldiers to sack the town.</p>
               <p>The consternation into which Wang was thrown by this message may easily be imagined; for he knew from the character of the governor that it was no idle threat, but a stern purpose, which if his wishes were not complied with, there was every reason to believe he would carry out. He begged his daughter, therefore, to pause before she refused her consent: telling her that though he despised Zingallah as much as she did, yet it seemed to be her duty to acquiesce; and that, perhaps, her wise and amiable temper might in time alter his character, and make him more reasonable and humane.</p>
               <p>The people of the town also added their entreaties; for they had already got wind of the matter, and gathered in crowds round Wang's house, begging Nourillah, by all means, to follow her father's advice, and depicting in lively colours the misery that would result if the governor carried out his savage threat, which they felt certain he would do to the very letter if Nourillah persisted in her obstinacy.</p>
               <p>But the lady continued inexorable. She said she was already betrothed to a young man, whom she loved tenderly, and, who reciprocated her affection; and that to break her engagement with him in favour of a detested tyrant would be the height of meanness. She further added, that Zingallah, in making his threat, was only endeavouring to terrify her to bring her over to his views, and that, bad as he was, he would never dare to carry it into execution. With these, and such like arguments, did Nourillah<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC5973-00000072"/> endeavour to maintain her position; but they had little effect on the people of the village, whose fears were excited to the highest degree. They ceased not therefore to remonstrate with her; painting in lively colours the scenes that would ensue if the place were sacked, the sufferings that would fall on so many innocent people, and the lives that perhaps would be sacrificed—including her own family and relations, and women and children. They said, too, that her proposed course was the more unreasonable, as it would not be of the slightest avail; for whether she consented or refused, the governor would certainly fulfil his purpose and carry her off by force.</p>
               <p>Overcome, at length, by such persuasions, Nourillah's resolution gave way; and she finally agreed that if Lascar would consent to free her from her engagement, that she would comply with the wishes of her friends and townsmen. Nothing was now wanting but the consent of Lascar, and this was readily obtained; for though he was a youth of great spirit, and detested the tyrant as much as any one, yet he would not let his own private feelings stand in the way of the public welfare—more especially as Nourillah had sacrificed so much, and by whom he was not willing to be outdone, He therefore at once relinquished all claim to his betrothed, though, at the same time, he uttered threats against the tyrant, which, however, were at the time considered merely as the outbreak of his excited feelings.</p>
               <p>When the news reached the castle that Nourillah had consented to the marriage, the governor appeared highly delighted, and dispatched to her a splendid present, saying what great pleasure the alliance would afford him, and hoping that in future a better feeling would exist between himself and the people of the town; and that if, hereafter, it were in his power to do them any service, or confer on them any benefit, he would be most happy to do so. These fine promises, however, did not afford the people much satisfaction; for Zingallah had deceived them so often that they put but little reliance on any thing he said. After a few days had elapsed, during which the governor had made several visits, accompanied with a splendid retinue and bearing beautiful presents, a day was fixed for the nuptials.</p>
               <p>In the meantime, Lascar brooded in secret over his wrongs and determined to be revenged. But how to accomplish his object was the difficulty; for in Zingallah's visits to the town he was always surrounded by a strong guard, so that it was impossible to approach him. To get access to the castle seemed also impracticable; for, as we said before, it was situated on a high hill, and was defended on one side by a frowning precipice, and on the other by an immense wall and strong gate, into which no stranger was ever admitted.</p>
               <p>Often did the young man examine the cliffs, to see if it were not possible by some means or other<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC5973-00000073"/> to scale them, but they seemed insurmountable; till one day he spied, at a great height, some goats, and concluded that as they were able to climb up the rocks it would not be impossible for him to do the same—at least he was resolved to attempt it. The day of the marriage was the time he chose to carry out his design, for he had learned that the governor was to send his guards to escort the bride to the castle, and that he, meanwhile, would be left comparatively alone.</p>
               <p>Time rapidly passed and the afternoon previous to the wedding having arrived, Lascar proceeded to carry his perilous design into effect. Clothed with a light garment, and with a sharp dagger in his belt, he stole unobserved from the village and arrived at the foot of the cliffs. He now began to ascend; and, as he expected, found it a work of great difficulty. Often would the loose stones give way under his feet, and the vines and twigs to which he clung would break in his hands and almost hurl him headlong; the sun, too, beat upon him with all its fierceness, making the rocks fairly glisten with the heat. Thus, with severe toil and with his hands and feet torn by the sharp crags, did the young man slowly mount the precipice. It was late in the afternoon when he reached the spied where he had some the goats; he found it a narrow ledge scarce a yard in width, and, much to his mortification, perceived that he was still a great distance from the summit, and that nothing like a path or foothold was now visible; but, on the contrary, that the rocks overhung in such a way as to render any further progress quite impossible. His toil and fatigue therefore were all in vain, and nothing remained but to seek out some cleft where he might repose for the night, sheltered from the heavy dew which was now beginning to fall. He soon found a crevice into which he thrust himself, and, to his surprise, found that it was a long cavern, the roof of which was vaulted and evidently formed by the hand of man. The idea now flashed upon him that this passage connected with the castle; and such was the fact, it being neither more nor less than a drain for carrying off the waste water. This discovery afforded him much joy, for he concluded now that he had an easy way of gaining access to the building. He, therefore, lay down to repose, resolved to be up bright and early and carry out his enterprise at all hazards.</p>
               <p>The light of a beautiful summer morning broke into his cavern and awoke him; and when he came, out and stood on the ledge, he had an enchanting prospect of the village beneath him and of the country for miles round. He could see throngs of people flocking in all directions to the little town, to behold the bridal procession which was already forming at Wang's house, and was now preparing to escort the bride to the castle. He could distinctly hear the music and the cheers of the assembled multitude.<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC5973-00000074"/> Thinking there was no time to be lost, he tightened his girdle and, drawing, his dagger plunged into the cavern.</p>
               <p>For some time he groped in darkness, but the light gradually broke in upon him, and the passage soon landed him safely in a large courtyard. He hastily crossed it, and entering a side door, passed through several rooms and corridors without meeting a soul. But now he heard voices, and looking through a door which stood ajar, he saw a beautiful hall of vast dimensions and splendidly furnished. In the midst of this magnificent apartment, seated on a sort of throne gorgeously appareled, sat Zingallah awaiting his bride, and surrounded by a few old men and women. The sight of his hated rival excited the wrath of Lascar to the highest pitch; he rushed in, and with one stroke of his weapon laid the tyrant dead at his feet. The servants screamed with terror and fled in all directions; but the young man soon reassured them, telling them that he had not the slightest intention of harming them, and that his vengeance was fully satisfied now, that he had slain their tyrannical master.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, the bridal procession had set out for the castle. It was composed of the governor's guard, some on foot and some mounted, with music and banners. The lady herself rode on a white elephant a beneath a crimson canopy, and behind came her friends and relatives, followed by all the people in their holiday attire.</p>
               <p>Thus did the gay procession move up the hill towards the castle, expecting, as they approached it, to find the gate thrown open. But, much to their surprise, this was not done. A sudden halt was now made, and the soldiers began to suspect some treachery; not were their fears allayed, when looked up they saw Lascar standing on the battlements with Zingallah's head in his hand. On seeing this the people set up a shout of joy, in which the governor's guards soon joined; for, in heart, they hated the tyrant as much as others, and were well pleased to see his career brought to a close. The gate being opened they all rushed in, hailing Lascar as their deliverer; and as there was now no owner to the castle, it was unanimously decided to bestow it upon him as a just reward for his courage and virtue. The marriage of Nourillah and her lover was at once celebrated; the day was spent in festivity, and at night the castle was lit up so brilliantly that the country was illuminated for miles round.</p>

               <head>STORY OF THE WONDERFUL WAND.</head>
               <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC5973-00000075"/>
               <p>ARAHMINIDES, the Wise, had three pupils: Plutus, Milo, and Calenus. He had, for years, instructed them carefully in all the learning of the East; and now, the period of their studies having drawn to a close, he assembled them together, and thus addressed them:</p>
               <p>"My young friends," said he, "your course of instruction with me is now finished; you will bear witness with what care and patience I have endeavoured to impart to you whatever I thought would be of use. We have studied together the works written by the sages of antiquity; and all that, by meditation or observation, I have myself collected, during a long life, has been freely shared with you. Nevertheless, there is one thing yet wanting to make you prosperous and happy, and that is—the wonderful wand. To help you to this great prize, is out of my power; yet I am quite certain it exists, and can be attained only by your own sagacity and diligence. Go forth, then, and leave no means untried to secure this great treasure; and should you be successful, return hither, and show it to me, that I may be a witness of your good fortune, and that my old eyes may be gladdened with the sight of such a precious wonder." Having thus spoke, the old man kindly embraced them; and wishing them good luck, bade them farewell.</p>
               <p>The hearts of the young men were stirred by this appeal from their honoured preceptor; and they resolved to set out immediately in search of this valuable prize, having first agreed that, on a certain day, three years hence, they would reassemble at the house of Arahminides, and report the success of their endeavours; and with mutual good wishes, and affectionate farewells, the three pupils separated.</p>
               <p>Plutus, who was the eldest, after cogitation the matter sometime, determined to set out for India; for he knew that it was one of the richest countries in the world, abounding in mines of gold and precious stones, and thought that this rare treasure was more likely to be found there than anywhere else. He, accordingly, made his arrangements, and set out on his journey; and after several weeks travel, arrived in India. He settled in one of the business towns, and commenced trade; and as he was very industrious, honest, and frugal, he met with great success, and succeeded, at length, in amassing a large fortune. His only object, in securing wealth, was to use it as a means of discovering the prize he was in pursuit of; and he now began to move from town to town, and from village to village, offering rewards,<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC5973-00000076"/> and inquiring of every one he met, if they could give him any information of the wonderful wand, and where it was to be found. But his inquiries all proved fruitless: most of the persons had never, they said, even heard of it; some had heard of it, but knew nothing further concerning it; and some, allured by the hope of reward, amused Plutus with vain hopes and promises of furthering his wishes, which all proved fruitless.</p>
               <p>The young man then moved to Delhi, the capital city; and, having hired a fine house, prosecuted his researches with still greater diligence. Here, too, he offered a reward still larger than he had before; and got acquainted with all the men of science and learning—questioning them, and endeavouring, by every means in his power, to elicit something that might throw light on the matter he had in view. But all his efforts were unsuccessful; and, becoming tired of the pursuit, he came to the conclusion that, perhaps, after all, Arahminides was mistaken; and that there was really no such thing in existence; and began already to think of turning his steps homeward.</p>
               <p>There happened to be living at that time in Delhi, a very skilful jeweler, who, like many others, had heard of the young stranger's wish, and who, after meditating much on the subject, came to the conclusion that he might be able to help him to procure what he was in search of. He, therefore, called on the young man, and asked him if the thing he was in pursuit of was a thing already existing, or whether it was something that might, by labor and art, be constructed.</p>
               <p>"As for that," replied Plutus, "I cannot certainly answer; but, I suppose, if I can only procure it, it matters little as to the mode by which it is accomplished."</p>
               <p>"So I thought," answered the jeweler. "Listen, then, to me, and I will point out the way by which the thing is to be done. You must buy up, with the means you have at your command, all kinds of precious stones of the finest and most beautiful species; give them, then, to me, and I will form out of them a staff which will amaze every one that sees it; and if that is not the wonderful wand, I know not what it is."</p>
               <p>The young man eagerly embraced this proposal, thinking that he was now in a fair way of securing the object he so much desired; he, accordingly, bought up all kinds of the most precious stones, and delivered them to the jeweler, who promised, by the end of the year, to have the work finished and delivered to him.</p>
               <p>When the year expired, the Jeweler brought the wand to Plutus, who was ravished with delight at beholding it. It was constructed with the most consummate art, so that the mode by which the stones were fastened together could not be discovered, and<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC5973-00000077"/> the different coloured jewels were so beautifully blended that the whole appeared to be but one stone. He paid the artist most generously for it; and its fame spread so rapidly, that the people of the town flocked to see it, and all declared that so beautiful a thing had never before been seen. Being confident that he now possessed the wonderful wand, he began to think of returning to his own country: for the three years were drawing to a close; and having bid his friends farewell, he set out on his journey, and, after some weeks' travel, reached the residence of his old master, Arahminides.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, Milo, the second pupil, had been as busy as Plutus in pursuit of the prize. After pondering the matter over, he determined to start for Egypt: for that was the land of wonders; and if any thing wonderful was to be found, that, he thought was the place for it. There was the pyramids, the sphinx, the obelisks, the Nile, and every thing strange and admirable; there was the cradle of civilization, of religion, of the arts and sciences; and there was the seat of learning, and the home of the wisest men. He, accordingly, directed his course thither; and after a few weeks, arrived at the low shores of the Nile. After passing the pyramids, which he stopped to examine, he proceeded up the river, and came to the great city of Thebes.</p>
               <p>He determined to join himself with the priests, who were the chief depositaries of learning, and from whom he was most likely to gain information that would lead him to the object he was in pursuit of. He accordingly hired himself as an attendant in one of the chief temples, where it was his duty to wait upon the priests, to keep the building clean, and such like employments. To these duties he attended most Zealously, and by honesty and industry, joined to an obliging disposition, he succeeded in ingratiating himself with his employers. One of the old priests in particular became his friend, and did all he could to render his labours light, and make his situation comfortable. He went so far even as to promise him that at some future day he would show him the secrets of the temple, and exhibit to him some of the means by which they carried on their arts of necromancy, and succeeded in preserving an ascendency over the populace. After the young man had been here some time, he succeeded, after a number of days, in prevailing on the old man to fulfil his promise. The latter told him it was a thing that required much circumspection and secrecy, for that it was contrary to the rules, and might bring them both into peril if discovered.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, one night, when all the others had retired, the old priest, who kept the keys of the temple, asked Milo to follow him, telling him to look as much as he liked, but to be careful not to utter a word. He unlocked a secret trap door in the floor, and shutting it very carefully behind them,<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC5973-00000078"/> they descended a dark stairway, which seemed to the young man as if it would never come to an end. At last, however, they reached the bottom, though still enveloped in the profoundest darkness, when the priest pushed open a door, and they found themselves in an immense circular hall, lighted up with such a brilliancy as almost dazzled them. Around the sides of this vast apartment were blocks of marble, at each of which was chained a black slave, with tools and materials of all kinds before him, employed in manufacturing the various agencies and contrivances used by the priests and magicians. So busily engaged were they at their work, that they did not even look up, or take the least notice of the intruders, who passed quietly across the hall, and came to a second door, which the priest unlocked, and after passing through several passages, they came to another circular hall, larger than the first, and lit up like it with dazzling brightness.</p>
               <p>From the floor to the roof it was filled with all kinds of curiosities and contrivances, arranged in cases, with staircases and surrounding galleries. They mounted these galleries, and the young man's guide opened a number of the cases, and exhibited to him various works of art, which excited his wonder. Continuing on, they came to a shelf, from which the priest took an ebony staff, about a foot and a half in length, beautifully polished. With a little key he wound it up, and then hurled it over the railing of the gallery. It lay for some time on the marble pavement below, and Milo wondered why his companion fixed his eyes so intently upon it. But his wonder soon ceased as he perceived the stick, after first rolling backwards and forwards, suddenly to stand on one end, and commence dancing. And now proceeded from it a strain of most delicious music, the movements of the staff all the while keeping time with it. This continued for a considerable length, when the strains gradually died away, and the motions became slower and slower, till the instrument fell at last on its side, where it remained but a few moments, when suddenly it sprung into new life, and flying upward, lit in the hands of the priest.</p>
               <p>Milo was astonished at beholding this extraordinary piece of mechanism, and the idea at once entered his mind that it was the wonderful wand, the very thing he was in pursuit of, and which he was, of all others, most desirous of possessing. His guide still led him round, and showed him several other curiosities, after which they descended and retraced their steps. They crossed the great hall where the slaves were at work, and who still pursued their employments without noticing them, thence mounted the dark staircase, and found themselves again in the temple. The young man now thanked the priest for his kindness, and expressed his delight<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC5973-00000079"/> and wonder at what he had seen, and after wishing him good-night, repaired to his couch.</p>
               <p>But little did he sleep during the remainder of that night, his whole thoughts being engrossed with the ebony staff, which, as we said before, he was convinced could be nothing else than the wonderful wand, and which he was resolved to possess at all hazards.</p>
               <p>He arose early the next morning, determined to carry out his plans without delay. He knew very well the risk he ran, and that if he should be detected his life would pay the forfeit; but all this he looked upon as trifling, in comparison with the object he had in view. He accordingly made all his arrangements to leave the place that very night; and the hour, of midnight being past, when he knew every one was asleep, he quietly arose from his bed, and entered the chamber where the old priest slept. He found the keys in the pocket of his clothes, which lay upon a stool, and having secured them, he entered the temple and opened the trap door, very quietly shutting it after him. He descended the stairs, and after some time reached the great hall, which was, as before, brilliantly illuminated, with the slaves still at work. It was with much fear and trepidation that he entered this apartment, but there seemed no occasion for it, as the slaves continued at their employment without, even raising their heads, or taking the least notice of him. He then proceeded through the passages and reached the second hall, and after ascending the staircase, and passing along the galleries, he came to the very case in which was the object he was so eager to possess. With trembling hand he unlocked it, and there lay before him the much-coveted prize. He hastily seized it, and concealing it beneath his garment, he hurried down. He then retraced his steps, and crossing again the hall of the slaves he mounted the staircase and came out into the temple. He laid the keys gently on the floor, and opening the gate of the building, made the best of his way out, glad that his enterprise had succeeded so well.</p>
               <p>That very night he left the city and traveled on foot to a small town on the river some miles below Thebes. There he took passage in the first boat going down the Nile, and, after some weeks, reached his own country and repaired to the house of Arahminides, which he reached at the expiration of the three years, and on the very day that had been agreed upon.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, Calenus, the other scholar, had not passed his time idly, though he spent it in a way very different from that of his classmates. He was naturally of a reflecting mind, and not disposed to do things in a hurry; and though he reverenced his teacher quite as much as the others, he thought, before starting out in quest of the prize, that he would go and consult an old uncle of his named Skylus, to<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC5973-00000080"/> whom he had been used all his life to look up with the highest respect for his wisdom and virtue. He was very aged, and lived the retired life of a shepherd, possessing large flocks and living as a kind of patriarch among his servants and neighbours.</p>
               <p>To this excellent man did the youth repair, and received from him a very friendly and hospitable welcome. He then told him the object of his visit, and how his master, Arahminides, had sent him in search of the wonderful wand, and concluded by asking his uncle if he could throw any light on the matter, or give him any information that might lead to its discovery.</p>
               <p>The old man looked somewhat surprised at hearing this, and asked his nephew if his preceptor had given him no instructions as to the means by which the prize was to be secured.</p>
               <p>"None in the least," answered Calenus; "he sent us forth without telling us where it was to be found, whether north, south, east or west; nor was he able even to describe to us what it was like; my friends. Plutus and Milo, have already set out in pursuit of it, but in which direction they have gone I cannot, for the life of me, say, as they thought not proper to tell me. I thought I would take no steps without first consulting you; tell me, therefore, if you can, what I had best do."</p>
               <p>"And pray, how can I throw any light on the subject," replied Skylus, "if your learned tutor, Arahminides, is unable to do so?"</p>
               <p>"True," answered the youth, "Arahminides is a learned man, but there may be other persons in the world as wise as he, and you, my dear uncle, may be one of them; tell me, therefore, frankly and candidly if you know any thing about the wonderful wand."</p>
               <p>"I cannot deny," said Skylus, "that I know something about it; and if you will have patience and wait till hereafter, I may possibly be the means of helping you to possess it. But for reasons which I consider just and proper, you must not question me about it any further; but, on the contrary, must place implicit confidence in my words, and as long as you remain under my roof, which you are welcome to do as long as you wish; you must faithfully obey all my commands and conform to all the rules of my family, however difficult or arduous they may appear."</p>
               <p>Calenus was delighted when he heard this; for he believed now that he was in a fair way of discovering the great prize, and could not help smiling at the folly of his fellow pupils in wandering to distant lands for a thing that, if rightly sought, might be found at home. He, therefore, promised his uncle that the would cheerfully comply with all his wishes and fulfil all the duties that might be assigned to him; and, above all, that he would not ask him a<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC5973-00000081"/> single further question about the treasure he was in search of.</p>
               <p>He now became a member of the shepherd's household, and began to perform his part in the labours of the establishment. He took charge of his uncle's business and superintended his servants; he was satisfied with the most frugal fare, and inured himself to all kinds of weather; he rose early; he listened attentively to the good advice that fell from his relative's lips, and cultivated an obliging and generous disposition, so that he became a universal favourite. With these works of industry and virtue his time, passed pleasantly and rapidly, and so many new ideas occupied him that he gradually lost sight of the wonderful wand, and at length forgot all about it.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the health of Skylus, who was of great age, began to fail; and, although his friends did all they could to succour him, and especially Calenus, who lavished upon him the greatest attention and kindness, their efforts proved unavailing, and the old man at length yielded up the ghost. Being very rich, every one, of course, expected that his nephew would be his heir, for he was the nearest relative he had, and his special favourite besides. A few days after his death his will was read, which recited his flocks and lands and to whom they were to go; stating further, that beneath the floor of his house would be found certain pots of gold, which were to be divided among some distant kinsmen, whom he particularly named. The will concluded with saying—"My old oak stick, which lies in the garret, I leave to my dear nephew, Calenus;" and this was the only place in the document where his name was mentioned.</p>
               <p>The relatives and neighbours who were assembled, were much surprised when they found that Calenus was thus cut off, and the young man felt much mortified; and when one of the bystanders very officiously ran up stairs and brought him his legacy, he felt very much like breaking it over his head. He deliberated some time whether he should take the stick or not, but concluded that he would do so, and not give way to any exhibition of anger which he knew would only make him appear ridiculous. He, therefore, took up the oak staff and returned to the town where he had formerly resided; and, as the three years had now expired, he thought he would repair to the house of Arahminides; and, accordingly, proceeded thither, arriving there at the very day and hour that had been agreed upon.</p>
               <p>He met his friends, Plutus and Milo, at the door, and after shaking them by the hand, and mutual congratulations at their happy reunion, they entered the house.</p>
               <p>They found their old master seated at his table, just as they had left him three years ago, surrounded<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC5973-00000082"/> with books and parchments. He was overjoyed at seeing them, and gave them a most hearty welcome.</p>
               <p>"And so, gentlemen," said he, "here you are, returned safe from your travels; and, I suppose, like many before you who have gone in pursuit of this famous prize, your search has proved fruitless?"</p>
               <p>"By no means," replied Plutus; "have patience, my master, and you will soon see that my labour has been very far from proving fruitless." And so saying, he unlocked a long rosewood case, which he had under his arm, and, drawing out his jeweled staff, laid it on the table. They all beheld it with amazement, and declared, with one voice, that they had never, in their lives, seen any thing so beautiful. Its splendour almost dazzled them; and the light that flashed from it, illuminated the apartment. Arahminides took it up, and carefully examined it.</p>
               <p>"This," said he, "is a most extraordinary sight! the stones of which it is composed are of the rarest kind, and it is put together with the most artistic skill. But you deceived yourself, my dear Plutus, in supposing it to be the wonderful wand; for I can assure you it is not, but only a jeweled staff of exquisite workmanship."</p>
               <p>"How?" exclaimed the young man; "not the wonderful wand?"</p>
               <p>"No," returned Milo; "our master is right in what he says. You have showed us, it is true, a splendid piece of jewelry, and nothing more: the wonderful wand I have got myself; and you shall see it, in a moment, with your own eyes." And so saying, he drew from his bosom a bag of crimson velvet; and having opened it, took from it his ebony stick.</p>
               <p>"I hope," said Plutus, "you do not call this the wonderful wand?"</p>
               <p>"Have patience, my dear fellow," answered the other, "and let Arahminides be the judge." And so saying, he applied his key to the stick; and having wound it up, placed it on the table. In a few moments it began to roll; then stood up, and commenced a dance—at the same time sending forth such strains of delicious music, that all present were transported with delight, and gazed upon it with wonder and admiration. Gradually the motions and sounds grew fainter and fainter, till, at length, they ceased entirely, and the staff fell on its side. Arahminides then took it up, and examined it:</p>
               <p>"This, my dear Milo," said he, "is a most ingenious piece of mechanism, and wounderful indeed; but it's no more the wonderful wand than the jeweled staff of Plutus; and now, Calenus, tell us what luck you have had: for you, too, I suppose, have traveled to distance countries, and brought back something rare and extraordinary."</p>
               <p>"There you are mistaken," replied Calenus; "I have traveled nowhere at all; but have remained quietly at home, at the sheep folds of my uncle<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC5973-00000083"/> Skylus. I asked him if he had ever heard of the wonderful thing that you sent us in search of; he said he had heard of it, and that was all: for he never afterward opened his lips about it, and seemed to look upon it as a mere foolish phantom."</p>
               <p>"Very good," returned Arahminides; "your uncle was a wise man, and I have not a word to say against him; for I quarrel with no man for his opinion. However, it is certain, all of you have been unsuccessful. What say you, then? Suppose we try it again, and this time all set out together? I will myself accompany you; for I am somewhat fatigued with study, and need a little relaxation; and perhaps my age and experience may be of some benefit to you."</p>
               <p>This proposal the young men eagerly embraced; and having made their arrangements, the next day the party set out under better auspices, and with fresh vigor, in pursuit of the wonderful wand. It was agreed that their traveling expenses should be defrayed by exhibiting Plutus's jeweled rod and Milo's ebony staff; and they doubted not but they would be enabled, in this way, to collect money enough to supply all their wants, and have a large surplus in the bargain. They accordingly set out in high spirits, conversing, as they went, upon a thousand different topics—their master pointing out, as they walked along, each object that he thought might be of interest, and endeavouring to extract, from every thing they saw, some lesson of instruction.</p>
               <p>About noon, they came to a river, which it was necessary for them to cross; and, as there was no bridge over it, they were compelled to make use of a miserable boat, which they found by the shore, destitute of oars or paddles. They, however, all got into it; and Calenus pushed it off with his oak stick, which he also used a as a kind of oar, and in this manner, deeply immersed in philosophy, they slowly crossed the stream, not noticing that there was a huge hole in the bottom of the scow, through which the water was very quietly and rapidly entering. When they reached the center of the river, and in the midst of Arahminides's profound discourses, the boat became swamped, and it, and the whole party (the weighty arguments perhaps assisting), suddenly sunk to the bottom, with Plutus's jeweled rod, and Milo's ebony stick, which were never seen afterwards.</p>
               <p>This unexpected catastrophe almost frightened them out of their wits; and when they rose to the surface, which they did in a few moments, they all grasped Calenus's oaken staff, which floated upon the top of the water. Strange to say, it held them all up; and, paddling as well as they could with their hands, they managed to steer to the shore—though so slowly did they move, that it was a long time before they accomplished it. They all crept up the<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC5973-00000084"/> bank like drowned rats, and began wringing the water out of their clothes—the two young men piteously bemoaning the loss of their treasures, and wondering now how they would defray their expenses, as they, had no curiosities to exhibit, and could, of course, collect no money.</p>
               <p>"Leave that to me, young gentlemen," said Arahminides. "I have not been studying philosophy these sixty years, without having something to show for it. I will turn counselor and adviser; and will soon have clients enough around me, who will be only too glad to get my advice, and pay me such fees for it, as will make your purses too heavy almost to carry."</p>
               <p>Cheered with this intelligence, the young men renewed their gaiety, and their garments now being well dried, they again started off and proceeded some distance along the highway. They soon met a traveler, well dressed and mounted on a sleek mule; and Arahminides, thinking that he now had a chance of showing his talents and gaining a fee, went up to the stranger, and saluting him, politely informed him that he was a counsellor; that his whole life had been passed in study; and that if he wanted any advice on any subject, no matter what, he was ready to give it to him cheap as dirt.</p>
               <p>"Pretty advice must it be!" cried the traveler, "if it's as cheap as dirt! Get along, you old vagabond, and do not be throwing your brains about the road in this manner, for you've none to spare, I warrant."</p>
               <p>This speech mortified Arahminides exceedingly, but the young men took it quite differently, and burst out laughing, upon which their master sharply reproved them.</p>
               <p>After this they encountered many other travelers and wayfaring men; but the old gentleman did not seem inclined to offer his services in the way of advice any further, so this source of revenue was suddenly brought to a standstill.</p>
               <p>Their funds being exhausted, they were much concerned how they should procure a dinner, for they were beginning to feel quite hungry; when they chanced to pass an orchard, fenced in with a high wall, the branches of the trees extending into the road, and filled with fine fruit, but so high that they could not reach it. Whilst Arahminides and the others were planning how they should get at the apples, Calenus very quietly, with his stick, commenced knocking them down; and thus they were furnished with an ample dinner, besides carrying off a supply for future use.</p>
               <p>As the evening drew on they came to a halt, and having no money to pay for a lodging, they were compelled to sleep in the open air beneath some trees. They accordingly made a supper of the apples that were left, and then prepared to take their repose, having first lighted a fire, as a precaution to<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC5973-00000085"/> scare off wild beasts, if there should be any about. As Plutus was gathering an armful of sticks to feed the fire, he picked up without noticing it, for it was quite dark, the oaken staff of Calenus, and throwing it on the coals it was soon in a blaze.</p>
               <p>"Alas!" cried Calenus, "what have you done? You have burnt up my uncle's stick, which saved us all from drowning, and has been so useful to us; but I will try and save what is left of it;" and with these words he made a grasp at it, charred as it was, and drew it out transformed into a rod of gold.</p>
               <p>"The wonderful wand!" exclaimed Arahminides, "the wonderful wand! Yes," continued he, taking it in his hand and examining it, "this stick of your uncle's, my dear Calenus, is the wonderful wand, and has the magic power of converting all it touches into gold at the wish of the owner. Keep it, then, for you have fairly earned it. Do not hoard up your wealth, nor yet spend it lavishly on selfish pleasures, but do good with it. Tomorrow we will all return home, for we have now found the prize we were in search of."</p>
               <p>The other young men congratulated their friend on his good luck; and the next day they all returned, loaded with the wealth which the magic wand had already procured for them, and which Calenus cheerfully shared with his companions.</p>

               <head>STORY OF THE FOOLISH DERVISE.</head>
               <p>THERE was once a foolish dervise, who took it into his head that he would apply himself to learning, imagining that he would become the wisest man in the universe—for he was the silliest creature that ever lived. He attended sedulously all the schools, but his teachers, though they tried hard, could do nothing with him, and told him frankly that his brains were soft, or that, in other words, he had no head. He was surprised when he heard this, for he thought it strange that every one else should have a head, and he be without one; so, to put it to the proof, he ran and butted against a stone wall, which soon convinced him that he had a head as well as the rest of them. He came and told this to his teachers, who replied, that when they said he had no head, they only meant his head was out of order.</p>
               <p>"Oh!" said he, "if that be all, I'll go to the doctors and have it put in order;" for he thought the doctors could do every thing. He accordingly went, and begged them to take off his head, and give it an examination. The doctors laughed, and told him it<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC5973-00000086"/> was impossible, for though they could very easily take off his head, the difficulty would be to put it on again; besides, they said, there was no such case in their books, and that alone would prevent them from undertaking it.</p>
               <p>Finding that he could get no satisfaction, he determined to act for himself; and, after considering the best mode of accomplishing it, he decided upon hanging, for, as he was very corpulent, he thought he would very easily be able to jerk his head from his body by such an operation, and give it a thorough examination. He accordingly tied his garters together, and fastening one end round his neck, he climbed, a cocoa nut tree, and trying the string to a limb he sprung off; and his garters breaking he dropped heavily to the ground, shaking the tree in such a violent manner as to knock off a huge cocoanut, which he eagerly ran after and picked up, taking it for his head.</p>
               <p>He put it under his arm, rejoicing greatly, for he was resolved to give it a thorough overhauling. For this purpose he bored a hole in it, and the sight of the milk running out put him in high glee.</p>
               <p>"Ah!" said he, "'tis no wonder I've been so stupid. My masters were right enough when they said my brains were soft; but I'll warrant I'll soon be able to stand among the foremost of them."</p>
               <p>Having regulated his head to his satisfaction, he began to think of putting it on again, but this puzzled him sorely, and with all his wisdom he could hit upon no method of doing it. He resolved therefore to leave it as it was, and carry it under his arm; for he thought this just as good a way as carrying it on his shoulders, more especially as he would often have to mix with ignorant people, with whom it made little difference how he carried his head, or indeed whether he had any head at all.</p>
               <p>Filled with these ideas, he walked on till he came to a river, where was a ferry boat for conveying passengers and cattle across the stream. On making inquiry he found the fare was so much a head, so he resolved to evade it and save his money by leaving his head behind, which he accordingly did, burying it in the sand. On reaching the opposite shore, the ferryman came and demanded the toll.</p>
               <p>The dervise told him he had no right to demand toll of him, for the fare was so much a head, and that he had left his behind, burying it in the sand. But the ferryman did not understand such logic, and, lifting up his pole, gave him two or three raps over the shoulders which caused him to roar out most lustily.</p>
               <p>The poor dervise stepped ashore much mortified, and proceeding some distance along the road, came to a large building used as a college, where the learned men met together to deliver lectures and discuss philosophy. He entered and sat down among the wise doctors. When the gentleman who<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC5973-00000087"/> was then lecturing had finished his discourse, he thought that here was a fine opportunity to display his talents; so, without saying a word to any one, he left his seat and mounted the pulpit. But, no sooner had he opened his mouth to speak, than all at once he burst into tears—for he recollected he had not his head with him.</p>
               <p>The students at seeing this were all astonished, and crowding round him, begged him to tell them what was the matter. On hearing his story they all commenced laughing, but soon checked themselves, being resolved to humour his whims and have a little spoilt with him. They accordingly told him not to distress himself at the loss of his head, for heads were necessary only for common people, but that men like him had not the slightest need of them.</p>
               <p>This idea tickled the dervise exceedingly, and he thought what a fine thing it would be if he could carry it out a little further, and dispense not only with his head but his whole body. After considering the matter, he resolved to follow the same plan he had adopted before; that is, by jerking off his legs and arms, and as for his trunk he knew he could easily dissolve it away in a tub of lye; for it was, indeed, almost one mass of fat.</p>
               <p>He accordingly climbed a tree, and having fastened a cord to his ankles and to one of the boughs, he flung himself off; but his legs and the cord too, proved stronger this time than he expected; and, instead of effecting his purpose, he suddenly found himself suspended in the air, in a most extraordinary and uncomfortable position, which caused him to set up such loud screams that the whole school came running out to see what was the matter.</p>
               <p>"Why, dersive," cried they, "what in the world are you about? are you trying some gymnastic exercise? or, is this the posture you philosophers assume when in deep study? come, give us now the fruits of your meditations."</p>
               <p>"Mercy on me!" cried the dervise, "what ails me? the world seems all upside down."</p>
               <p>"Pshaw," answered one of the doctors, who was somewhat of a wag, "is that all you have discovered? why, I've known that myself these forty years;" and, so saying, he went up to him, and, taking him by the skirts, gave him a whirl which set him spinning like a top. Upon this the poor man redoubled his cries, and the blood and humours of his body settling downwards, made his position quite torturing.</p>
               <p>"Oh, my head! my head! my poor head!" cried he.</p>
               <p>"Why, dervise," exclaimed the bystanders, splitting with laughter, "we all thought you, had no head."</p>
               <p>"I thought so too," answered he, "but I find I<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC5973-00000088"/> was mistaken; pray, gentlemen, have pity upon me, and do something to relieve me."</p>
               <p>The students now thinking he had suffered enough for his folly, cut him down and set him on his feet, whereupon he waddled off as fast as he could and never was heard of afterwards.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>STORY OF JUPITER AND ORION.</head>
               <p>IN the pleasant country of Thessaly there once lived an old shepherd, who, by dint of industry, maintained himself and an only son, named Orion, in tolerable comfort. This young man was a pattern of good conduct and filial obedience, and, indeed, was the main stay of his aged father; on him the labour of attending the flocks principally depended; he arose early and retired late, and exposed himself to all kinds of weather in the prosecution of his labours. He often led his flocks to the foot of Mount Olympus, pasturing them on the fine grass which grew there; and would sometimes, while the goats were feeding, sit on some shady rock and gaze upon the snowy summit of the mountain, where it was believed that the gods had their habitation.</p>
               <p>He was at this place one afternoon and was preparing to return home, when a gust suddenly arose accompanied with violent thunder and vivid lightning. He took shelter in a cabin hard by, which was owned by his father, and had been built as a place of refuge against storms. He had hoped that at sunset the rain would have ceased; but it still<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC5973-00000089"/> continued as furious as ever, so that he saw he would have to spend the night in the solitary cabin. He secured the door as well as he could, and made a frugal meal of some bread and olives, and as it was quite dark he stretched himself on the floor for repose.</p>
               <p>In the course of the night, he was aroused by a loud knock at the door. He sprang up, and asked who was there.</p>
               <p>"Let me in," said a voice outside; "I am no robber nor wrong doer, but a wayfaring man, seeking shelter from the storm." Whereupon the young man unbarred the door, and the stranger entered.</p>
               <p>"You are very dark here, my son," said he; "let us see if we cannot have a little more light." With this, he struck his rod on the walls of the cabin in several places, from which bright flames issued forth, making the place as light as day.</p>
               <p>Orion was astonished when he saw this; for though the country he inhabited was famous for its incantations, yet he had never seen any thing of the kind before, and hardly knew whether he was awake or dreaming. The stranger was a tall man, clothed in humble garments, with a staff in his hand. He asked the youth if he could furnish him with something to eat. Orion brought out the remains of his supper, and set it on the table before his guest, telling him it was all the food he had; but, such as it was, he was heartily welcome to it. When the stranger had finished eating, he rose up, and thanked Orion for his hospitality.</p>
               <p>"Young man," said he, "I have heard of your good conduct before, and, especially, of your devotion to your father: such virtue deserves some reward. Go you to the valley on the south side of the mountain; follow it up till you reach its narrowest part, and you will find there a stream of clear water, gushing from a rock overgrown with laurels. It is the fount of Apollo. On the mossy bank you will find a shell: dip it in the stream, and drink of the water; and whatever you ask of the god of the fountain, he will grant you." So saying, the speaker threw off his homely garments; and there stood before the wondering Orion, Jupiter, king of gods, arrayed in all his beauty and splendour.</p>
               <p>The young man fell on his face; and when he arose, the stranger had disappeared, and the cabin was dark as midnight. He crept to his pallet, and lay for a great while revolving the whole matter in his mind, and, as we said before, not knowing whether it were a reality or a dream.</p>
               <p>The bright sun of a summer morning streamed into the building, and awakened him; and he sprung up, the vision of the night still occupying his mind. He went to the foot of the mountain, and, collecting his flock, drove it home, and found his father sitting at the door of his house, milking some goats.</p>
               <p>He took a seat on the bench beside him, and began<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC5973-00000090"/> telling him what had happened during the night: how he had been detained by the storm, and of the strange vision that had appeared to him; and concluded by asking the old man's advice, as to whether he should go to Apollo's fount; and if he did, what he should ask for. His father told him he was clearly of opinion that he should go to the fountain, as it would not be treating the gods with respect if he did not; but as to what he should ask for, that was a thing to be left to himself; nor would he interfere in the matter in any way whatever. The young man, accordingly, after getting through his work, bade his father farewell, and set out for the place.</p>
               <p>He roved about the foot of Olympus the whole day, meditating as to what he should ask for: now sitting down on some projecting cliff—and now starting up, lost in thought, and wandering about, he knew not whither. At last, late in the afternoon, he made up his mind; and proceeded to the valley that Jupiter had designated, though not without some fear and trembling.</p>
               <p>It was a dark ravine, bounded, on each side, with craggy rocks crowned with luxuriant foliage, and so still and silent that it struck him with awe. He followed it up a considerable distance; and now it grew so narrow, that his further advance seemed to be stopped, and the deep silence was broken by the sound of falling water. He went up to the fountain, and found the shell lying on the grass beside it; and, dipping it in the limpid basin, he drank off the water, wishing, at the same time, that Apollo would grant him a life of pleasure.</p>
               <p>Scarcely were the words out of his mouth, when he fell senseless to the earth; and, on recovering, found himself at the entrance of a beautiful garden.</p>
               <p>A lady, of elegant form, and exquisitely attired, came forth to meet him; and, taking him by the hand and smiling graciously, invited him to enter. She led him up a walk of great width, paved with amber, and bordered, on each side, with all manner of trees, loaded with flowers and fruit. Other walks branched from this, winding, in every direction, among tufts of trees and flower-beds; and fountains, of every size and form, sparkled among them, sending forth murmuring sounds which ravished the ear, and gave life to the enchanting prospects. Far as the eye could reach, never ending vistas and embowering shades stretched on all sides; and, gliding among the trees, or reclining on the soft grass, were endless groups of figures, male and female, of beautiful form and elegantly habited, who seemed bent on nothing but mirth and pleasure. Orion was ravished at the sight, and captivated with the affability and charming behaviour of his guide—begging her to tell him where he was, and who were these multitudes of happy beings.</p>
               <p>"These," replied the lady, "are the Gardens of Delight; the countless multitudes, you behold, are the<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC5973-00000091"/> happy beings who inhabit them. I am one of the chief patrons of the place; my name is Endimone; and rightly am I so called, for I am the giver of happiness, mirth, and joy; but, come, let us walk beneath these embowering trees, and mingle with the festivities." So saying, she left the main avenue, and, striking into a path to the right, she led the young man among the joyous throngs. Some were engaged in the dance, and tripped it lightly on the velvet sward to the sound of soft music; some lay reclined on couches of the richest materials beneath arbours of flowers, with tables before them loaded with sumptuous dainties and exquisite wines; some sauntered about the grounds, gazing at the fountains and ponds with their swans and gold-fish—at the beautiful statuary and other objects of art; some lay on the soft grass in dreaming indolence; and some, overcome with food and wine, slumbered away their existence.</p>
               <p>Orion mingled among the gayest of the throngs, and was received by them with open arms; all hearts seemed to be endeared to him; there was no coldness nor backwardness, no care, nothing to restrain, but every face smiled upon him; all was warm and kind and genial, and he felt as if he had known them forever, and could live with them forever. But most gracious of all to him was the lovely Endimone. She seemed to anticipate his wishes, and pointed out to him all the beauties of the place, leading him about from one scene of enchantment to another, and amusing him all the while with her sprightliness and lively conversation.</p>
               <p>"But come," said she, "let us return to the avenue, and walk up, and enter the palace."</p>
               <p>By this time the evening drew on, and the silvery moon, in a cloudless sky, threw a mild lustre over everything. They came to the palace, and mounted the high and broad steps that surrounded it. It was already lighted up, and blazed from top to bottom, and its piazzas and vast apartments swarmed with mirthful throngs; soft strains of music were heard. They entered the great hall which ran through the building, and upon which the other rooms opened. It was of great width, and seemed interminable. On each side was a row of crystal columns, and between each column, on a pedestal, stood a gold statue of a youth, bearing in his hand a lighted torch, shedding fragrant perfumes. Endimone led Orion first through the hall, then into the apartments, which were most richly furnished, and like all the rest of the building, thronged with revellers, who lay reclined on the soft couches, or feasted at the tables which were spread on all sides. They then came out on the portico, and saw, as far as the eye could reach, that the garden was lit up with various coloured lamps, amid which the fountains sparkled, and the gay multitudes enjoyed themselves.<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC5973-00000092"/> This scene of mirth was kept up all night, and short were the slumbers of Orion.</p>
               <p>In the morning he called for Endimone, but she was not to be found. He wandered about through the garden, from one to another, asking what had become of her; but all shook their heads, and were unable to tell him, each seeming to be immersed in his own enjoyment, and in the participation of the sports, which were renewed with the same hilarity as on the day previous. The sun shone as bright as ever, the music melted in the air, the flowers bloomed, but the beautiful being who had introduced Orion into these fairy scenes was missing, not did he ever behold her again.</p>
               <p>He saw, too, that the gay beings, smiling and attractive as they were, were not the same he had seen the day before, for it seemed that the creatures who inhabited these gardens had but a butterfly existence, basking but a few hours in the sunshine, and then disappearing forever. He found, too, that the pleasures and attractions of the place began to wear away the longer he remained there; his good spirits began to droop; he became melancholy and languid, broke away from his gay companions, and wandered about solitary and disconsolate. He threw himself on the grass by the side of a pond, and saw his image reflected in the water. The sight almost horrified him. His rosy and healthy appearance had fled, the bloom of youth had departed, his skin was sallow, his eyes sunken and dull. He rose up in haste, without saying a word to any one; he came out from among the shady groves and rosy bowers, he entered the grand avenue, directed his steps to the entrance, and bidding adieu to the Gardens of Delight, passed out through the magnificent gate.</p>
               <p>Leaning on a staff, which assisted his tottering steps, and begging his way from town to town, for he was now a miserable object of wretchedness and poverty, he turned his steps towards his father's residence, and after many weeks of weary travel, reached the happy home of his childhood.</p>
               <p>He found the old man sitting on a bench at the door, milking his goats, and went up and embraced him. His father scarcely recognized him, tears flowed down his cheeks, and for some time he gazed upon him in silence.</p>
               <p>"Oh, my son," said he, "do not wonder that I thus stare at the. When I last saw thee thou waste on the way to Apollo's fount, gay as the lark, and ruddy and blooming as the morn. Oh, tell me what has happened since? what hast thou done? what sin hast thou committed that Jupiter hast inflicted upon the such a punishment?"</p>
               <p>"I have committed no sin at all," replied the young man. "I went to Apollo's fount, as you advised me, I drank of the water, and asked the gods to<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC5973-00000093"/> give me a life of pleasure; my wish, was granted, and only see to what it has brought me."</p>
               <p>He then related in detail all that had happened; of the joyous life he had at first led, how his enjoyments gradually faded, how he suddenly fled from the Gardens of Delight, and of the wretched condition he was now in. His father endeavoured to comfort him, telling him how thankful he should be that he had escaped so many dangers, and had reached home at last, where he hoped now, after the experience he had had, he would remain contented, and pass the remainder of his days in peace and happiness.</p>
               <p>In the course of time he gradually recovered his health and spirits, and resumed his former occupations. Then his mind reverted to the strange scenes he had lately passed through, and he thought he would again stroll to the foot of Olympus, and to Apollo's fount, though not with the intention of asking any thing from the deity. He accordingly started out, and after traveling up the valley, came to the fountain. He threw himself on the grass, gazing at the tranquil scene, and when he saw the sparkling water gushing from the rock, he felt tempted to try his luck again.</p>
               <p>"I was unfortunate in my first essay," said he, "because I asked for what I should not have desired, for I was by nature intended for better things than to spend my life in sloth and pleasure. I will this time ask for something noble and glorious, even for fame, and I am sure the gods will not disappoint me when I ask for a thing so exalted and praiseworthy."</p>
               <p>He accordingly took up the shell, and dipping it in the limpid basin, drank off the water, wishing at the same time that Apollo would grant him fame and glory.</p>
               <p>Scarce were the words from his mouth when he fell senseless to the ground, and on recovering found himself in the midst of a vast battle-field. Loud strains of martial music filled the air, and the tramp of cavalry and footmen, the clashing of weapons, the rattling of chariots, the shouts of the victors, and the groans of the wounded and dying, resounded on all sides. Orion was borne along by the retreating hosts, upon whose faces terror was depicted, and the exulting victors, with cheers of triumph, closely pursued them. Presently the king, riding in his chariot, with tears streaming from his eyes, and with a little band of faithful friends surrounding him, came hurrying forward.</p>
               <p>The sight filled the heart of Orion with pity and sorrow. A superhuman energy suddenly came over him; he grasped the horses by their heads, and stopped the chariot; then he seized the royal banner, which lay trailing at the king's feet, and mounting a horse unfurled the standard: he called to the retreating army to rally and follow him, and boldly advanced to meet the pursuers. The sight of their ensign and of a leader so bold revived their drooping<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC5973-00000094"/> ing courage, and filled them with enthusiasm; and now the tide of battle was turned; the pursuers were pursued, and the vanquished became the victors. Orion bore the banner aloft, and the enemy melted before him: the victory was complete.</p>
               <p>The king came up and in the presence of the whole army thanked his deliverer, whom he seated in his chariot beside him, and carried in triumph to the capital. He was lodged in a palace, and the whole country united in showing him honour. The young man was intoxicated with the glory that surrounded him; and now he perceived, what before he had not noticed, that he had received many severe wounds in the conflict, which gave him great pain, and which would require some time to heal. He retired therefore to his chamber, where every attention was paid to him by his attendants, and every comfort and luxury bestowed upon him.</p>
               <p>But in a few days a message came to him from the king that another army was approaching, and begging him to come forth and be their champion again. Weak and miserable as he was, Orion was compelled to comply; and, mounting his horse, led the troops to battle. Fortune favoured him: he gained the victory, and put the enemies to flight, and was again hailed as the benefactor and preserver of the country. But this time, too, he received severe wounds, and returned to his palace to have his health restored, and to enjoy some repose after his labours.</p>
               <p>But his enjoyment was short-lived: another message soon came, requiring his presence in the field, and he was again compelled to go forth. He was triumphant as before, utterly routing the foe, and putting it out of his power to molest any one again. He was wounded this time also, and returned to his palace so injured that he could scarcely stand upright without assistance. Greater honours than ever were now lavished upon him, his name was in every one's mouth, and throngs flocked to get a look at him. He retired to his apartment, with orders to admit no one, but peace and quietness seemed to have fled from him: deafening huzzas shook the walls of his dwelling, and the glare of the bonfires that were lit up in every part of the city streamed through the windows. He was told that the king and nobles were preparing for him a triumphal procession on the morrow, such as never before was seen; and that it would be necessary for him to participate in it, and show himself, whatever his feelings might be or however he might wish to decline.</p>
               <p>He lay on his splendid couch till midnight, tossing from one side to another, unable to sleep. "And this is fame!" said he; "I once could slumber sweetly, but now sleep has fled from me; I once had health and strength, but now I am sick and crippled; I once had quiet and tranquility, but now I have not<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC5973-00000095"/> a moment's rest. "And is this the life I am to lead henceforth! if so, I had rather be dead than alive."</p>
               <p>With these words he crept from his bed, and throwing over his shoulders an old garment, and taking two sticks to support his tottering steps, he unlocked the door of his chamber, and descending the stairs as quietly as he could, he opened the outer door of the palace and slipped into the street. The streets were illuminated with bonfires, and crowded with boys and men shouting huzzas, and making the sky echo with the name of Orion. The sounds almost set him beside himself; he avoided the throngs as much as he could, and the principal thoroughfares, threading his way through lanes and alleys, and reached at length the gate of the town. He was glad when his back was turned on the hateful place, and now he directed his steps towards his own country, and after many days of weary travel, lame with his wounds and long journey, he at last drew near his father's dwelling. He hobbled along on his two sticks at a snail's pace, scarcely able to drag one leg after the other, and reached the old homestead.</p>
               <p>He found the old man sitting at the door as usual, milking his goats, the very picture of health and happiness. It was some time before he recognized his son, and when he did he burst into tears.</p>
               <p>"Oh my son," said he, "tell me what ails thee, and what hast thou been about? What sin hast thou committed, that Jupiter has inflicted upon thee such a punishment?"</p>
               <p>"I have committed no sin at all," said Orion; "I asked but for fame; my wish was granted, and only see to what it has brought me."</p>
               <p>He then related all that had happened to him, and ended by saying how happy he was now at having arrived home, which nothing should ever induce him to leave again, for sorrow and misery were the portion of all who wandered from it. With care and good nursing he gradually recovered, his wounds healed, his health and good spirits returned, and he became as well as ever.</p>
               <p>He resumed his occupations, and led a peaceful, contended life, watching his flocks as they browsed on the fertile pastures, or strayed over the hills and vales; and amusing himself with his flute, seated upon some high cliff or beneath some shady elm. In these hours of solitude his thoughts often reverted to his past life, and to the ill success he had met with in the pursuit of happiness. "But perhaps," thought he, "all this may be owing to my ignorance in pursuing wrong objects; that the gods are my friends in most certain, or they would never have manifested to me such kindness and condescension. I will go to Apollo's fount once more; but this time I will not ask for pleasure, for I see now how transitory and fleeting it is—that it is not suited to man's nature, but is ever the harbinger of sorrow; neither<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC5973-00000096"/> will I ask for fame, for that, too, is a vain delusion, an empty breath, and the murderer of peace. No, this time I will ask for riches, which bring with them a solid good, and which will confer on me the power of bestowing good on others, on my father and friends especially."</p>
               <p>He, accordingly, made arrangements to carry his designs into effect; and, without saying a word to his father, he set off for the fountain, and, filling the shell, he drank off the water, and prayed to Apollo to grant him abundance of wealth.</p>
               <p>The words were scarcely out of his mouth, when he fell senseless; and, on recovering, found himself in a dark subterraneous cavern. The continual noise of a ringing sound struck his ears; and, as his eyes grew accustomed to the gloom, he saw, at one end of the cave, a stream of gold coin issuing from a crevice in the rock, which fell, with a sharp click, on the marble pavement. The sight delighted him; for he had never before, in his life, seen so much money; nor had he ever imagined that the whole world contained such a quantity as he now beheld. He hurried forward to get a share of it; and, in doing so, stumbled over some immense piles of gold, which he had not observed.</p>
               <p>"What are you about there, meddling with my pile?" exclaimed a gruff voice from a figure that now came towards him.</p>
               <p>"I did not intend to meddle with any body," said Orion; "but stumbled accidentally over this heap, as it lay in my road."</p>
               <p>"You must be more careful," said the other; "for I allow no one to meddle with my property."</p>
               <p>"I have not the slightest intention of doing so," returned the young man; "for, if I know myself, I would not willingly defraud any one of a farthing: but, if you can spare a moment, pray tell me who all these old men are, and what it is that so busily occupies them?"</p>
               <p>"These old men," replied the other, "are my brethren, and worthy gentlemen they are; we are the prudent people: the world calls us misers; but we are too old to care what the world says. We spend our days and nights in shoveling up the gold from yonder fountain; and each has, as you see, his pile, some bigger and some less. We are all striving to heap together as much as we can; for, as I said before, we are most prudent, and look very far ahead."</p>
               <p>"And is any one at liberty to catch what falls from yonder golden fountain?" asked Orion.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes," replied the other; "take up a shovel, and go to work as quick as you please—only do not disturb any of these piles, or you will create a hubbub. Look to your own business as much as you like, and take care of number one; but tread not on anybody's toes."</p>
               <p>"That I faithfully promise," replied the young<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC5973-00000097"/> man." And taking up a shovel, he proceeded to the gold stream, and commenced helping himself.</p>
               <p>He saw, now, numbers of old men; and could not help wondering at the eagerness with which they worked. Their hair was white as snow; some were bent almost double, and so decrepid and tottering that they could scarcely stand. But the weakest and most aged seemed, if any thing, the most avaricious; and plied their shovels most industriously, looking, with intense delight, at their accumulating piles. The sight of these boundless treasures quite intoxicated Orion; and he set to work with the greatest spirit and energy. He resolved to have a pile bigger than any that he saw; and, having youth and strength on his side, he did not think this would be difficult. For weeks and months, he went on with his task; though to him it was no task, but, on the contrary, a pleasure, the like of which he had never before experienced; and he saw, now, that his treasures far exceeded those of his companions. So much was he interested in his occupation, that he did not perceive how he was wearing himself out with toil; and how fast the damp and unwholesome air was undermining his constitution.</p>
               <p>His companions, too, were so busy at their work, that they said little or nothing to him; but when they saw his riches accumulating so fast, throwing their own quite in the shade, they could not help expressing some wonder.</p>
               <p>"Sir," said one of them to him, "what, in the world, are you going to do with your vast treasures? why, you've enough already to set up a dozen Croesus's."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I'll find use for it," replied Orion, smiling.</p>
               <p>"And pray tell us," continued the other, "how you have contrived to gather so much in so short a time, whilst we have been nearly a lifetime at the business, and have not collected a quarter as much?"</p>
               <p>"Why," returned Orion, "I can do more work than you, since I am young and vigorous."</p>
               <p>On hearing this, the old gentleman dropped his shovel, and, clapping his hands to his side, burst into a loud laugh.</p>
               <p>"What makes you laugh so?" said the young man.</p>
               <p>"Why," replied the miser, "I am laughing at your talking about youth and vigor. Come, tell me, truly, how old you are?"</p>
               <p>"I was twenty-five, last autumn," replied Orion. "Pray, how old do you take me to be?"</p>
               <p>"Why, in truth," answered the other, "if I were to judge from your talk, I should say you were scarcely half-weaned; but, judging from your looks, I would set you down as over ninety."</p>
               <p>"Me over ninety!" cried Orion, throwing down his shovel. "Why, what do you mean? explain, if you please, how you make it out?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing easier, "replied the other; "just look<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC5973-00000098"/> at your head: is it not white as snow? look at your face: is it not full of wrinkles? look at your eyes: are they not bleared? and look at your back: is it not like a hoop?"</p>
               <p>Orion was amazed at hearing this; and putting his hand to his head, he plucked out a lock of hair. Sure enough, as the old man said, it was as white as snow; he felt his face, and found it full of wrinkles; his eyes he knew were half-blind, from looking so much at the gold; he attempted to stand upright, but could not do it, for his back was really bent almost double. He now discovered that his comrade had not, in the least, exaggerated; but had truly described his appearance. He called him, as he was walking off; and begged him to come back.</p>
               <p>"My friend," said he, "how would you like to have my heap of gold?"</p>
               <p>"Why, I always thought," returned the old man, "you had a great deal more than you needed."</p>
               <p>"Yes," answered Orion, "and I intend making a present of it to you."</p>
               <p>"A present to me!" cried the miser; "but you'll expect a remuneration for your present, of course?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly I will," replied the other; "I will expect you to show me the way out of this place."</p>
               <p>"Is that all you ask?" said the miser, "I'll oblige you with all my heart."</p>
               <p>He now told the youth that the cavern was situated in the bowels of a mountain, and that he would take him to a spot whence a subterranean passage would lead him out of it into daylight. They went forward, and after walking some distance came to a dark hole, which the old man told his companion he had only to step into, and, after creeping along the bed of a little rivulet for a few rods, he would find himself in the open air. Orion, eager as he was to escape, did not much like the looks of the place, and hesitated a good deal about letting himself drop into it. But such delay did not suit the old miser, whose time was valuable and who was anxious to get back to his gold; so, without any scruple, and while his comrade was stooping and endeavouring to penetrate the darkness, he gave him a push and tumbled him in.</p>
               <p>He fell with a plunge into the water, and the sudden shock and surprise rendered him senseless; he was carried along by the current, and when he came to himself he found that he was on the shore of a small stream not far from the foot of a high mountain. He was thus again in broad daylight, and breathed with pleasure the pure air, after having been so long suffocated in the murky vapours of the dark cavern. He was now able to see himself as he really was, and a pitiable spectacle did he present. He was transformed into an old man of ninety, bent double, with tottering steps and shriveled limbs. When he looked at himself he burst into tears, and picking up a couple of sticks to support him, he<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC5973-00000099"/> hobbled along, endeavouring, as he best could, to find his way home. After many days and weeks of weary travel he came in sight of his father's house; but when he reached the garden gate could go no further, but sunk to the earth moaning piteously.</p>
               <p>His father, as usual, was sitting by the door milking his goats, and hearing a cry of distress, left off his work and went to render assistance. He lifted up the stranger, and carrying him to the house, set him on the bench; and when he saw what a picture of old age, helplessness and misery he was, tears started in his eyes. He took a seat beside him and thus spake:</p>
               <p>"Tell me, old man," said he, "what has brought you to this condition? for such a picture of sorrow and wretchedness my eyes never fell upon. Has your life been passed in hunger, and thirst, and want? and has no drop of earthly comfort or joy ever fallen to you? have you been abused, reviled, slandered or maltreated by your fellow men, scourged by evil tongues and never experienced a word of kindness? has sharp poverty been your lot, or have family troubles broken your heart? has your wife died and left you lonely, or have your children wronged or deserted you? if so, know that thou hast a companion in thy misery, for I, too, have a son who has long since left me, and gone I know not whither."</p>
               <p>"Alas! alas!" cried the other, "I am that son—I am Orion!"</p>
               <p>His father made no answer, but threw his arms round his neck and burst into tears.</p>
               <p>"Oh, my son," said he, "where hast thou been and what hast thou been doing? what sin hast thou committed that Jupiter has inflicted upon thee such a punishment?"</p>
               <p>"I have committed no sin at all," said Orion; "I asked but for wealth; my wish was granted, and only see to what it has brought me."</p>
               <p>His father said not a word, but lifted his son in his arms and carried him to the foot of Olympus; he proceeded up the valley and reached Apollo's fount. He laid him gently on the grass beside it, and dipping the shell in the stream, handed it to him, telling him this time to beg the gods to give him a contented mind. Orion did so, and drank off the water; at the same time offering the prayer his father had suggested. And now a loud clap of thunder was heard, and Jupiter appeared standing by the fountain.</p>
               <p>"Orion," said he, "the things you asked for before have all been granted to you; but you did not choose wisely, and did not, therefore, derive from them the satisfaction you expected. Your last wish restores you to my favour; this night you shall sup with me on the top of Olympus; and to-morrow, clothed with immortality, shall shine brightest among the stars."</p>

               <head>STORY OF ULRIC AND ALTENWEIL.</head>
               <p>AMONG the students who attended the university of Vienna, were two, named Ulric and Altenweil, between whom a great friendship sprung up. They both possessed superior intellects, though in other respects they were not much alike, the former being rather of a sedate disposition, whilst the latter was ardent and excitable, so that people often wondered how two of such opposite tempers could harmonize, not reflecting that from this contrariety of temper the warmest affection often arises.</p>
               <p>Ulric was a resident of Vienna, where his family belonged; and Altenweil lived, when at home, with his uncle who was a baron of some note, and had a fine castle on the banks of the Rhine. His wife was dead, leaving him an only child, a daughter, named Rose, who had just arrived at womanhood, and was beautiful and amiable, and most tenderly beloved by her father. She had been betrothed several years to her cousin Altenweil, who often, in the exuberance of his feelings, described her to his friend, and always looked forward impatiently to the day when vacation would commence, and when he should return to his romantic home, and again enjoy the society of her he so much loved. Often, too, had he invited Ulric to accompany him on a visit to the place, telling him how happy the baron and his daughter would be to see him—that they knew him already, so frequently had he spoken of him and described him, and that in many of their scenes of enjoyment his presence alone, seemed wanting to crown their felicity.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Ulric," he would say, "you must by all means come to Hartzburg. You must abandon your city modes for a while, and see how we country folks live. There we will throw off all restraint, and live according to the simple rules of nature; we will gaze upon the boundless forests and lofty mountains, we will inhale the pure breezes of the Rhine, we will hunt and fish and ride; you shall listen to the legendary tales of the baron, and I will bask in the sunny smiles of the charming Rose."</p>
               <p>Thus did this joyous young man, in the exuberance of his spirits, plan the many and various pleasures himself and friend were to enjoy at Hartzburg—but heaven had planned it otherwise.</p>
               <p>Being thus so urgently solicited, Ulric at length consented to make the visit, and the college term having come to a close, the students, in high spirits, set out on their journey. After several weeks travel, and meeting many adventures, they at length drew near the place of their destination, and halted for<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC5973-00000101"/> the night at the little village of Hartz, which was about a league from the castle. They stopped at the Black Eagle, an inn kept by Frederick, an old servant of the baron, who was overjoyed at seeing Altenweil, whom he had known from childhood. He treated them with great attention, giving them the very best his house afforded, and imparting to his young friend all that had taken place during his absence, and listening also to the adventures of the travelers, as they humouredly related the events that had occurred during their long journey.</p>
               <p>In the morning, soon after breakfast, they mounted their horses, and after proceeding about a league, through a shady road, mostly up-hill, they arrived at the castle. A message had been previously sent, announcing their approach, and the baron and Rose were waiting at the gate to receive them. The meeting was warm and affectionate, and Ulric at once felt himself at home, so kind and cordial was the welcome given to him. His intelligence and amiable demeanour pleased the baron and his daughter exceedingly, and they began to plan a hundred schemes with which to gratify him, and render his visit agreeable. As the travelers were somewhat fatigued from their long journey, they spent the first day quietly at the castle, whose grandeur and beautiful situation Ulric could not help admiring.</p>
               <p>The view from it was magnificent. It was situated, as we said, on a high hill, embowered in woods, at the foot of which flowed the glittering Rhine, whose course could be traced up and down to a great distance. Islands were seen here and there dotting its surface; on its banks were vine-clad hills and cultivated fields, villages and castles; now and then a boat or raft was seen, lazily floating on the stream; cattle were wading out from the shore, or grazing on the flats, reduced to a size so small as to be scarcely distinguishable. In the other direction the country was mountainous, and clothed, as it seemed, with an interminable forest, where Ulric was told game of almost all kinds was found in abundance.</p>
               <p>The next day, after breakfast, the baron came into the room where his young friends were, and thus addressed them:</p>
               <p>"My children," said he, "business of urgent import requires my absence for a few days. I will endeavour to expedite it as much as I can, so as to be soon back and enjoy again your society. You must make yourselves as comfortable as possible, and have a merry and happy time of it while I am gone. You, Rose, I appoint governor of the castle in my absence. You must be kind and gracious, yet at the same time exact that obedience and loyalty, which gallant gentlemen willingly accord to fair damsels." Having thus spoken, and bid them all farewell, he mounted his horse and rode off.</p>
               <p>"And now, Rose," said Altenweil, "it seems you<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC5973-00000102"/> are constituted our sovereign; on whom, may I ask, then, do you intend to exercise your authority?"</p>
               <p>"On those who deserve it," answered the lady. "Tell me, then, have you brought me that little book of poems from Vienna, that I commissioned you to buy for me?"</p>
               <p>"Alas!" replied the youth, "I entirely forgot it."</p>
               <p>"Forgot, it!" cried Rose, "and this is the third time, too, you have forgotten it. I must try and refresh your memory; such negligence and ungallantry deserves some punishment; what say you, Ulric? do you not agree with me?"</p>
               <p>"I agree with every thing Miss Rose says," replied he, smiling.</p>
               <p>"Very good," said the lady, "and now, Altenweil, for your grave offence, consider yourself as banished from my dominions for one week, and let me hope this penalty will have its due effect on you, and that you will come back a wiser and better man."</p>
               <p>"Excellent!" cried Altenweil, "and much thanks do I owe you for your clemency. I thought you would have given orders to hurl me from yonder Tarpeian rock, or at least have shut me up in the dungeon, with bread and water to live upon; and instead of that you have given me a week's holiday to ramble round the country, and drink wine with my old cronies at the Black Eagle."</p>
               <p>They all laughed heartily at this little freak of Rose's, which was looked upon as a fine joke, to be talked about hereafter, and give additional zest to their future meeting; and Altenweil, after bidding his friends a merry farewell, departed for the village. Thus did this mirthful young lady, in the innocence of her heart, devise what she thought was a mere piece of harmless frolic; not knowing the evil passions that lurked in the human soul, nor the envy and malice of the world, but thinking that every one was pure and good and happy like herself, and would sympathize with her in her sportive gaiety. Fatal, terrible error!</p>
               <p>Her lover having departed, she considered Ulric as given up to her charge, and that she was bound to tax her utmost powers to amuse and entertain him. She took him over the castle and showed him all its curiosities, leading him through the extensive gardens and grounds, and drawing his attention to, every thing that she thought would interest him. She showed him the library, which, though not large, contained much to interest a scholar like Ulric. Sometimes they rode out together, or walked through the tangled paths of the forest, or sailed on the blue Rhine. But though she tried to keep up as cheerful a demeanour as she could, her thoughts were all the while wandering after Altenweil; and her heart smote her for the way in which she had acted towards him. She began to fear that what she had intended only as a harmless jest might be considered by him as evidence, if not of an unfeeling heart, at<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC5973-00000103"/> least of a light and giddy disposition; and she was on the point several times of sending a message for him, requesting him to return. She counted the hours that must elapse before the week would expire, and longed for the happy period to arrive when she should again enjoy the society of him she so much loved, and might be able to show him that what she had done sprung not from any coolness of affection, but rather from an unlimited confidence in the mutual regard they entertained for one another. The refined and amiable manners of Ulric, which under other circumstances would have been so pleasing, were now almost lost upon her, and she would have much preferred, if possible, to have remained in her apartment, indulging herself in thoughts and pondering on subjects of far deeper interest. Her friend began to discover this, and in order not to trespass on her attention, would take long rides by himself round the neighbourhood; and in the evening, on his return, relate to her his adventures, and describe the places where he had been.</p>
               <p>One evening as they were sitting at the window, Ulric discovered, at some miles distance, a light among the wood-clad hills, and asked his hostess what it could be, and if she had ever observed it before.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Rose, "it is very often seen, and is some wild freak or incantation fire of Martha of Hartzburg."</p>
               <p>"Pray who is she?" asked Ulric.</p>
               <p>"She is a sorceress, or rather impostor, as I should call her," answered the other, "who lives by herself in a solitary cavern, precisely where yonder red smoke arises, and distant from here about a league and a half."</p>
               <p>"If the place be not too much out of the way," continued the youth, "nor too difficult to find, I should like very much to pay her a visit."</p>
               <p>"The spot is somewhat inaccessible," returned the lady, "yet with proper directions from almost any of the peasants you would have no trouble in finding it; yet I would recommend you not to go to her, as I look upon her as an artful woman, and never knew any good come from visiting her."</p>
               <p>Ulric said nothing in reply, but inwardly resolved to see this strange woman, as he was fond of studying such out of the way characters, and as it would be a little kind of adventure for him.</p>
               <p>Accordingly the next day he mounted his horse, and telling Rose that he believed he would go and see Martha, proceeded in the direction where the sorceress dwelt. He followed the route designated to him by the peasants as well as he could, but so woody and mountainous was the region that he became bewildered, and spent a great part of the day wandering about, he hardly knew whither. He now gave up all hope of finding the spot, and became solicitious only of returning home as soon as possible<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC5973-00000104"/> ble, for the afternoon was now drawing to a close. He was following a kind of bridle path, which wound round the side of a hill densely covered with underwood, when he suddenly heard a low humming sound, as of one engaged in reading. He dismounted, and leading his horse, the better to discover whence the noise proceeded, he threaded his way some fifty yards further, and came to a cave, before which a woman of large stature, with dark complexion, and black hair streaming down her back, was seated on a rock, poring over an immense book.</p>
               <p>"Who art thou," said the young man, "that thus pursuest thy studies alone in this wild and dreary place?"</p>
               <p>"I am Martha of Hartzburg," replied the woman, "and I pursue my studies in this solitary spot because they do not belong to common science, but are of an occult character, seeing they relate to those hidden secrets which no human knowledge can ever fathom; for I know the past, the present, and the future."</p>
               <p>"To know the past," replied the student, "is the part of the wise and learned; to know the present is open to all; but to know the future is given to none."</p>
               <p>"There you are mistaken," said the sorceress; "to know the present is not open to all; you know only the miserable and deceptive outsides of things, and nothing more; for to know well the present is to know the future, since the seeds of the future are wrapped in the present, and time does but unroll them."</p>
               <p>"If thou be so wise," said Ulric, "tell me who I am."</p>
               <p>"Thou art Ulric the student," answered the other, "the guest of Hartzburg and bosom friend of Altenweil."</p>
               <p>"Thou hast said right," replied the young man, "however thou hast come by thy knowledge; but as for the occult science of which thou speakest I am not qualified to judge, as it relates to subjects beyond my comprehension. What concerns me at present is, to get out of this wilderness and find my way back to the castle; for I have lost my way and have been wandering about these hills till I am fairly exhausted. Will you be kind enough, then, to tell me which course I am to pursue?"</p>
               <p>"That I will, most cheerfully," returned Martha; "but there is a heavy storm impending, and you had better remain here till it is over. I will tie your horse in yonder bark cabin; and you, in the meantime, can take repose in the cave, on some clean rushes, which you will find strewn on the rock."</p>
               <p>To this proposal, Ulric very gladly assented; and, as the rain was beginning to fall, he hastily retired into the witch's abode, and, lying, down on the rocky couch, was soon fast asleep, being fatigued and weary<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC5973-00000105"/> with his long ride. There we will leave him for the present, and return to Altenweil.</p>
               <p>With a light step and merry heart, he departed from the castle, and descended to the village of Hartz—laughing at the strange joke that Rose was playing upon him; and admiring the spirit with which she had performed her part, and thinking that, probably, by the next morning, a message would come to him, calling him back. He proceeded to the Black Eagle, where he was very kindly received by Frederic and the people of the village, with nearly all of whom he was acquainted. They wondered much what had brought him there; and, though he explained it to them, they did not seem to understand it, but shook their heads, and pronounced it a strange piece of business. What with relating his college adventures, and gossiping with the peasants, he managed to while away the first day pretty easily; and spent the following, rambling among the hills with his gun and fishing-rod, though his thoughts were all the while at the castle, meditating on his mistress, and wandering much how she was able to get along so well without him.</p>
               <p>Whilst such reflections flowed through the mind of Altenweil, surmises, of a far different nature, agitated the honest people of the village. They began, first of all, to discuss the stranger guest at the castle. Who was he? had he come on business, or pleasure sure? was he noble-born, or of common rank? rich, or poor? most likely, the latter; some upstart adventurer, most probably, who, by some means or other, had insinuated himself into the good graces of the open-hearted Altenweil, and had come here to sponge on the good baron's hospitality, and, eventually, to fleece him. In this manner they talked; and believed, also, that he was the prime mover in their young friend's banishment from the castle; for, they said, such a scheme could never have been planned by Rose, who was far too kind and gentle ever to have conceived of such a thing. They suspected, too, that he was endeavouring to win the affections of the young lady; and observed the attentions he seemed to pay her, when they rode or walked out together; and, now the baron was absent and the field clear, they feared that his wiles would prove too successful, and that poor Rose would fall a victim to his artful snares. "What a shame," said they, "that this insolent Viennese should be reveling in the castle, while their young friend should be compelled to put up with the humble accommodations of a country inn, and be debarred from the society of his mistress."</p>
               <p>In this manner did the peasants talk; and, as might be expected, their gossip soon reached the ears of Altenweil. It amused him exceedingly at first; and he made no further reply than laughing at it. But, when he saw with his own eyes, as he did,<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC5973-00000106"/> several times, Ulric and Rose riding out, engaged, apparently, in close and agreeable conversation; and when he reflected on the attractive demeanour and winning department of his handsome fellow student, which gained him friends wherever, he went, a feeling of jealousy sprung up in his bosom, especially when the sunrises, just referred to, were shared in by his dear Frederic, whom he had known from childhood; and whom he almost looked up to as a father; and who frankly told him, that he looked upon his banishment from the castle as most unfortunate; and if it were all done in joke, it was the most strange, ill-timed joke he ever heard of. The serious words and manner of this worthy man affected Altenweil deeply; and all the passions of his soul began to be stirred up.</p>
               <p>"Can it be possible," said he, "that this Ulric, whom I loved so well, and thought so much of, can prove perfidious? It cannot be! Yet strange suspicious come over me; and the opinions of persons, cool and unprejudiced, are not to be lightly disregarded. If this smooth-faced Viennese should prove a false friend, after all, swift and terrible shall be his punishment; but I am perplexed with doubt, so that I know not what to think, or what to do. I will go to Martha of Hartzburg, and inquire of her; for she professes to possess knowledge more than human, and can, as she says, clear up all doubts, and solve all mysteries."</p>
               <p>Having made up his mind to consult the sorceress, he lost no time in carrying out his designs; but, that very night, in the midst of a tremendous storm, set out to seek her abode. He found her at the entrance of her den, crouching over the embers of a fire; and thus addressed her:</p>
               <p>"Martha," said he, "I have come to you for advice."</p>
               <p>"What!" replied she, "has the noble, high-minded Altenweil come to seek advice from poor Martha? he who has so often mocked at her pretensions, and made himself merry at her expense."</p>
               <p>"When I did that," answered the youth, "my heart was merry, and the merry are always thoughtless; but, now, I come, in sadness, seeking that counsel which you only can give."</p>
               <p>"I divine already your trouble," said the woman: "it is some love affair."</p>
               <p>"Right," replied Altenweil.</p>
               <p>"And you fear some rival," said the other.</p>
               <p>"Right, again," answered the youth.</p>
               <p>"And you have suspicions, too, of some one, and wish your doubts cleared up."</p>
               <p>"You hit it, precisely," continued the student.</p>
               <p>"Suppose, now," said Martha, "by the power of my art, I should call up before you the image of him you suspect, think you you would know it?"</p>
               <p>"Know it!" cried Altenweil;" show me but his shadow! show me but his faintest outline, and,<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC5973-00000107"/> though it should be but for an instant; I would know it among ten thousand!"</p>
               <p>"Look, then," said the woman, "into the back part of the cave, and tell me what thou seest."</p>
               <p>"I see nothing," answered the student, "but a deep darkness which no eye can penetrate."</p>
               <p>"Look again," continued Martha, and as she spoke she threw on the embers of the fire an armful of dry rushes, which, suddenly blazing up, illumined the cavern with an intense light, and showed the figure of Ulric in the background, lying on the rock fast asleep. The sight lasted but for an instant, and the blaze dying out, the gloom which succeeded was deeper than ever. Altenweil was overcome with wonder and awe, and fell senseless to the ground; in a few moments, however, he recovered himself, and handing Martha a purse of gold, he mounted his horse and rode off without saying a word. So agitated was he that he scarcely knew where he was going, yet he instinctively bent his course towards the castle, to take vengeance on his once much loved friend; but whom the supernatural power of the sorceress had now convinced him was his real enemy and hateful rival. Scarcely had he departed, when Ulric awoke; and having remunerated his hostess for her hospitality and receiving directions as to his route, he, too, mounted his horse and proceeded towards home.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, the storm had ceased, and the innumerable merable rain drops hanging from the forest glittered in the clear starlight. The student rode leisurely along, and a little before sunrise came in sight of the castle. He rode up the avenue which led to the gate, when suddenly, from among the trees, a figure rushed upon him. It was Altenweil; a dagger gleamed in the air, and in a moment the unfortunate Ulric was no more.</p>
               <p>Having gratified his revenge, the infuriated Altenweil entered the castle; the first person he met was Rose. She threw her arms round him, exclaiming:</p>
               <p>"Oh, Altenweil, how glad I am thou hast returned, how happy now we will all be!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, Rose," said the student, "how well canst thou dissemble; why didst thou permit the treacherous Ulric to supplant me in thy affections and steal away thy heart?"</p>
               <p>"He has not done so," replied the lady, "nor did he ever wish to—oh, Altenweil, who has been infusing these vile thoughts into thy breast?"</p>
               <p>"Vile thoughts!" cried the youth; "rather call them vile deeds; are they not known to every one? are they not the common talk of Hartz?"</p>
               <p>"And does the high-minded Altenweil," asked Rose, "put faith in the foolish gossip of a paltry village?"</p>
               <p>"No," answered the student, "I put no faith in it—I sought better proof, and heaven has granted it;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC5973-00000108"/> I have been to Martha of Hartzburg, and saw there an evidence of her power which put all my doubts to rest and fully satisfied me; for, certainly, she who could call up the image of Ulric at her bidding, could never be deceived."</p>
               <p>"The image of Ulric!" cried Rose, "why it was Ulric himself; for he is now on a visit to the abode of that artful woman, who, I perceive, has managed some how or other to impose upon you. No doubt he will soon return and have a hearty laugh at the credulity and superstition of his friend."</p>
               <p>"No, Rose," said the student, "he will never return;—alas! what have I done? I have been the victim of my jealousy, rage and superstition; I have slain the good, the gentle, the innocent Ulric."</p>
               <p>The servants now entered, bringing in the body of the student, which they had just found in the road; Altenweil threw himself upon it, and drawing out the dagger plunged it in his own heart. Rose uttered one cry, it was her last; and fell beside her lover.</p>
               <p>A drum was now heard in the distance, and presently the baron, who had just returned from his journey, entered the hall. What a spectacle met his eyes! His young friends, whom he had left gay and happy, now lay lifeless before him, and the floor of the apartment was soiled with blood. He said nothing, but was carried by the servants to his chamber, from which he never emerged; for, in a little while he, too, descended to the tomb, and his beautiful castle passed into the hands of strangers.</p>

               <head>STORY OF CHIPO CAPAAC,</head>
               <head type="sub">OR THE MAN IN THE MOON.</head>
               <p>THERE was once encamped for the night, on the pampas, or vast plains of Buenos Ayres, a large company of traders returning from Peru, with droves of mules and merchandize, on their way to the city of Assumption. The cattle had been turned out to graze and the fires lit, and all now prepared to sit down to supper, of which the yerba or Paraguay tea formed an important part. Their meal being finished, they assembled in groups and spent the pleasant hours of the evening in listening to tales and narratives, of which the persons who compose such traveling caravans are passionately fond. These parties, however, one after another, all broke up and gradually collected round an extraordinary character. He was a man of great age, yet strong and vigorous, with a hale and rosy countenance and bright cheerful blue eyes. His hair and beard were white as the driven snow, and the perpetual smile which illumined his face, seemed to draw every one towards him. He was mounted on a splendid milk white steed, smoking, with great composure, from a costly pipe of amber; on his head was a straw Panama hat with a black band, his waistcoat was of white satin, embroidered with silver, and his jacket and pantaloons of black velvet, profusely ornamented with small buttons of solid gold. His boots, which were of the finest yellow leather, were adorned with massive silver spurs; and his saddle and bridle were also of the most superb description, so that he had, altogether, the appearance of a man of great wealth and influence.</p>
               <p>This was Chipo Capaac the Peruvian, or, as he was sometimes called, the Man in the Moon, owing to some marvellous adventures that once happened to him. Round this strange personage all the traders gathered, and begged him to relate to them the extraordinary scenes he had formerly passed through, which, though many had received at second hand, few or none had ever heard from his own lips. He looked upon the crowd with an air of great complacency, telling them to seat themselves on the grass, and that if he could in any way contribute to their amusement or help them to while away the night, he would most cheerfully do so. He then replenished his pipe from a silver tobacco box which he drew from his pocket, and leaning on the pummel of his saddle thus began.</p>
               <pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC5973-00000110"/>
               <p>Many years ago, when I was a young man, I was not near so well off as I am now, but was compelled to ramble about and gain my bread in the best way I could. I followed hunting, and spent my time in wandering about the hills and forests at the base of the Andes, were the deer and wild goats were then so plenty. I was out days and nights for weeks together, exploring the valleys and scaling the precipices wherever it was possible for the foot of man to tread; so that I got to be as well acquainted with those mountains, I believe, as any man in Peru.</p>
               <p>In one of these expeditions, I found myself a good ways up on the heights of Chimborazo, which you know is justly reckoned the highest of all the peaks. I had passed through the lower forests, and also through the belt of pines, and had now reached that part where vegetation begins to be sparse and stunted, consisting of low straggling bushes, scattered about here and there. The summit towered above me, terrible with its awful rocks and glittering snow. I determined to ascend it.</p>
               <p>It was a beautiful night, with a full moon, just like the one we are now enjoying. I was in fine spirits, and pushed forward, eager to accomplish a feat which, as far as I knew, had never yet been performed. Long and difficult was my journey; I wound my way though dark ravines, and clambered up the dry beds of water-courses and torrents choked up with stones of all shapes and sizes, among which I floundered, sometimes jumping from one to another, and sometimes slipping between them. When I was proceeding, as I thought, most successfully, and seemed almost within reach of the top, my progress would suddenly be blocked by a steep precipice, up which I would have to climb at the peril of my life, cutting steps in the crevices of the rock with my knife, and dragging myself up in the most laborious manner. Then when I would suppose the summit was almost within my reach, I would find myself on an immense plain covered with snow, and the peak of the mountain further off than ever. Sinking knee-deep at every step, I toiled onward, and came again to vast chasms and precipices, more awful and dangerous than those I had already passed, and with the snow and ice still increasing. But I was not to be daunted; for, as I said before, this happened many years ago, and these white locks were very different from what they are now, and these limbs were swift and agile as the antelope's. I proceeded thus along these tremendous caverns, over snowy drifts and icy bridges, still mounting higher and higher, and still approaching nearer to the summit, till I at length reached what seemed an immense piece of rock, shooting up to a great height, and almost perpendicular. Up this I toiled, for I believed now that my journey was nearly at an end; and, clinging to the crags with a death grip, and dragging one foot after the other, I at last came to a<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC5973-00000111"/> small level space, and stood on the top of Chimborazo.</p>
               <p>How shall I describe the scene! Below me was a chaos of precipices; rocks, caverns, and ravines, from which I had just emerged. A shadowy darkness hung over it, relieved here and there by the moonlight, which lay softly among the drifts of snow and glittering pinnacles of ice, and lighting them up with a preternatural brightness. All around were the Andes, mountains upon mountains; which, though I well knew their prodigious height, seemed now to be far below me, so elevated was I above them. To the eastward, stretched as far as the eye could reach, were the boundless plains of Brazil; whilst on the other side, so near that I could fling a stone in it, as I thought, lay the vast Pacific, like a sheet of molten silver, with what appeared to me a horizon almost limitless.</p>
               <p>But what most arrested my attention was the moon, which was in its full, and hung in the dark vault apparently twice or thrice its usual size, and shining with a splendour I had never before seen squalled. It seemed so near as almost to be within the sound of my voice, and I peered into its silvery surface, scanning what looked to me like mountains, hills, lakes, rivers, and forests, till I felt as if I were almost transported thither. How long I was gazing upon these strange and grand scenes I know not, but now a giddiness began to steal over me; and thinking that I was in a sorry place for an attack of that kind, I prepared to descend. I was in the more haste to do this, as I now heard beneath me, creeping up the gorges, the unmistakable sounds of a pampero, which is a kind of tornado that sometimes happens in those regions, and whose irresistible power sweeps all before it. I hurried crouching to the edge of the rock, in order to get down, but I was too late; for I was suddenly caught by the wind and carried off my feet, and whirled along I knew not where.</p>
               <p>A noise such as a bullet makes in its passage through the air whistled in my ears, I lost the use of my eyes, and felt as if I were falling from an immense height into some fathomless gulf. How long this lasted I know not, for my senses forsook me, nor did I recover them till I was aroused by a great splash, when I found that my speed was brought to a termination, and that I was sinking beneath the surface of a sheet of water. I descended to a considerable depth, and then slowly began to rise; and when my head emerged at the top I thought it high time to look about me and see where I was. Being an expert swimmer, I felt quite at my ease, and glided tranquilly over the water, which was as smooth almost as a mill-pond, and beautifully clear.</p>
               <p>The sky was brighter and fairer than I had ever before seen it: not a cloud was visible; but a soft<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC5973-00000112"/> and balmy breeze, almost imperceptible, refreshed my senses, and exhilarated me to a degree I had never before experienced. I was about half, a league from the land, the shores of which sloped to the water's edge, fringed with beautiful and majestic trees, with vistas opening among them of smiling fields and green lawns, the back ground rising into undulating hills. "Whichever way I turned my eyes, were these pleasant-looking shores—some nearer, and some further off. I was ravished with the delightful prospect; and began now to remember the events of the past night: how I had clambered to the top of the Andes, after a day of great toil; and how, when on its lofty summit, and admiring the view, I was suddenly whirled from my position, by a violent gale, and carried, I knew not whither. I concluded that the tornado had carried me far out to sea, and that I had been dropped in the Pacific, in the neighbourhood of some of those delicious islands, of which travelers give such glowing accounts.</p>
               <p>I, therefore, as I said, struck out for the shore, wondering what kind of reception I should meet with from the natives, numbers of whom I could see assembled on the beach. They did not, at first, see me; but I pushed forward until I touched bottom; and, as I was wading towards the shore, I was first observed by them; whereupon they came down to the edge of the water, and even some distance into it, in order to receive me; when, seeing I was fatigued, they lifted me in their arms, and carried me high and dry on the beach.</p>
               <p>I was much gratified with this kind reception, believing, for certain, that I was in the South seas. These islands, thought I, are, perhaps, the Friendly isles; and these polite gentlemen, the Friendly-islanders. As I was a stranger guest, and had entered their country in rather an unusual manner, I thought it no more than proper to give some account of myself: so I began to tell them, that I had been in one of the most terrific gales that man had ever encountered; that the sound of it was even now whistling in my ears; that my ship, I believe, had been blown sky-high, and myself plunged in the waves, among which I had been struggling, I could not tell how long, and was almost ready to perish when they so happily rescued me, for which I owed them a thousand thanks. "And now tell me," continued I, "is this sheet of water the Pacific, or not?"</p>
               <p>They shook their heads, and answered smiling, that they had never heard of such a thing.</p>
               <p>"What!" said I, "have you never studied geography? why, it's that great sea that stretches all the way from the coast of South America to China."</p>
               <p>They smiled again; but did not seem to comprehend.</p>
               <p>"However, you must have heard of Peru, at any rate," continued I: "it's the country where I was born,<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC5973-00000113"/> and the greatest in the whole world: the highest mountains are there, and great cities, and gold mines, and lamas and mules."</p>
               <p>They answered that they did not know such a place.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes," returned I, "you know it well enough; but you call it, perhaps, by another name: however, I'll set you right in a moment, and show it to you as large as life, even to the very town I was born in." I then took a stick, and drew, on the sand, a map of South America and Peru, with all the adjacent countries, showing, as near as I could, the place I came from. My drawing greatly interested them; and they seemed, in a moment, to understand it, pointing, at the same time, upward to the sky. I did not, at first, know what they meant; but I was not long in doubt; for, on looking to the heavens, what was my astonishment at beholding a large bright planet, as broad as the top of a barrel, and on its surface, distinctly marked, just as on a map, the continent of South America with the isthmus of Darien, North America with its lakes, Florida, the West Indies—with Cuba, spreading like a huge giant, among them. The truth now flashed upon me; and I discovered that I had lost my recknoning, and had been, all the while, talking like an arrant blockhead; for that, instead of being in the Pacific, among the Friendly-islanders, I had journeyed in a far different direction: having been blown upwards; and, after passing through the vast regions of space, had actually alighted in the moon.</p>
               <p>The strangeness and beauty of every thing now struck me more than ever, as also the beings with whom I was conversing; for I was so busy with other matters, at first, that I had not taken a good look at them. They were dressed in white cotton tunics, with sashes, of some coloured material, round their waists; on their feet, instead of shoes, they wore sandals; they were bare-headed—with bright sparkling eyes, full of vivacity and laughter; their complexions were fair to such a degree, that I never before saw any resembling them: I was myself in my youth accounted to have a fair countenance; yet there was almost as much difference between myself and them, as between myself and a negro.</p>
               <p>I now related my adventures in detail, without any disguise: telling them I had dropped from yonder planet, and, pointing, as near as I could, to the very spot; for the mountains of the Andes were plainly visible, and I thought I could even distinguish Chimboraze. I told them that the earth that I inhabited, though it looked so small, was of immense size; that it required years to travel round it; and that one of those smallest islands, which they saw upon it, was bigger than their whole planet. This assertion made them open their eyes with wonder; and, though they said nothing to the contrary,<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC5973-00000114"/> I saw, very evidently, that they did not believe it: however, they did not contradict me, but answered all the questions I put to them with the greatest kindness and affability. They told me, it was true enough, I was in the moon; that they were Moon men; and that the capital, where their king lived, was called Moontown. That it was a very large and beautiful city, built on the slope of a hill by the shore of a great lake, and in front of it was an island very pleasant and agreeable. They told me they would take me to this city, and introduce me to their king, who would be delighted to converse with a person who had come from another world. They told me, further, that the whole country was dotted with lakes, which were all connected together with narrow inlets, so that a person could travel by water from one place to another; and they pointed to the beautiful barges of carved wood, painted and gilded, which lay along the beach, and which I had not yet observed.</p>
               <p>By this time quite a number of the inhabitants had gathered together, and though they gazed upon me with much interest, yet were they not in the least annoying, but treated me with the greatest consideration and politeness. They now asked me my name, and told me several of theirs; and I found that the one among them with whom I had chiefly conversed was called Sunlight. They next led me to their houses which were some distance from the beach, asking me if I would not take some refreshment. I told them I would most gladly do so, for I was quite hungry; and we now passed through an open grove of tall trees, in which were flocks of sheep and lambs feeding. They pointed to them and asked me if we had such things in my country, and if I did not think them fine specimens. I told them we had plenty of such animals with us, but I never remembered having seen such handsome ones, and that I could relish exceedingly a fore quarter with mint sauce.</p>
               <p>When they heard this they all sidled away from me, crying out: "Cannibal!"</p>
               <p>"I'm no cannibal at all," said I; "the cannibals live in New Zealand, thousands of miles from me, and I have no more to do with them than you have; I'm an honest Christian, and would not so much as harm a fly."</p>
               <p>"And yet you kill and eat these poor, innocent creatures," said Sunlight.</p>
               <p>"Of course I do," returned I; "and good, wholesome food it is; if we did not eat them they would increase so fast as to eat us, so we are compelled to eat them in self-defence; besides that, they like to be killed, for it saves the poor things from a thousand calamities, and they would tell us so were we to ask them."</p>
               <p>To this logical appeal the Moonmen made no answer, but looked at me in silent wonder; and thus<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC5973-00000115"/> conversing we reached the houses. They were of white stone, very neat and pretty, with piazzas in front adorned with roses and other beautiful flowers, and a number of women met us at the door with smiling faces. To these I was introduced, and then entered an apartment neatly furnished and covered with mats; all very pleasant. A bountiful repast was furnished to me, consisting of bread, milk, eggs, cakes, and abundance of delicious fruits, but not a particle of meat; for, as I intimated, the Moonmen never kill or eat any kind of animal. The baaing of the sheep was now heard close by, and one of the women whispered to the boys to go and drive them away; fearing, perhaps, that I might spring out of the window and devour them. Besides the men and women, a great number of children had assembled to look at the stranger; and I asked the lady who waited on me what all these children were about, and if they never went to school?</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes," replied she, "they are going to school all the while, and their fathers and mothers are their teachers."</p>
               <p>"But you give them no lessons," said I.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes;" returned the other, "we give them the best of lessons; in the first place, we give them a good example; that you must admit is one good lesson."</p>
               <p>"Certainly," said I, "there is nothing like it."</p>
               <p>"Then we teach them," continued the woman, "to obey their parents, to be virtuous and truthful, to learn self-control and good habits, to have their wits about them and keep from reveries and day-dreams, to be polite and gentle in their demeanour, to be honourable and brave, to be active and industrious; this instruction makes them strong and healthy, so that when they grow up they are enabled to live useful and happy lives; and doing this we think they have learned enough."</p>
               <p>"Oh," answered I, "how different this is from our learning. With us a learned man is one who neglects his health entirely and spends his time shut up in a den which he calls his study, wearing out his eyes and racking his brain with the thousand wild cogitations and fancies of men like himself; he is eccentric and full of day-dreams, theories, and crack-brained whim-whams; his cheeks are sunken, his face pale and worn to a shadow; nerves and stomach he has none; he is usually sickly, and pines away before he has lived out half his days; then a eulogy is pronounced over him as a ripe scholar, and that's the end of him."</p>
               <p>"And what good does his learning do him?" inquired Sunlight.</p>
               <p>"That's more than I can tell," returned I; "but I suppose they get to know a great deal, though what advantage that is puzzles me; for I think, myself, the grand fault with people is, they know a great<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC5973-00000116"/> deal too much, at least this is my experience in dealing with them."</p>
               <p>In this manner did I discourse with the Moonmen while taking my repast; after which they told me, if I had no objection, that they intended taking me to Moontown, to introduce me to their king, to whom they had already sent notice of my arrival, and who, they were sure, would be delighted at seeing me.</p>
               <p>We now went down to the shore, a great throng following and gazing at me, yet treating me all the while with the utmost politeness, and being very careful not to press upon me or in the least to incommode me. Sunlight, who took me under his special protection, now escorted me aboard one of the handsomest barges, of which, as I said before, there were quite a number drawn up on the beach. Ours was the largest, having room for from fifty to one hundred persons; part of it was covered with a deck, with a little cabin very neatly furnished. We all got aboard and pushed off from the land, and I threw myself on the soft cushions admiring the beautiful scenery. The water was as clear as crystal and covered with innumerable wild fowl; and flocks of the largest swans and geese I ever saw, disported their snowy plumage on the placid surface. A dozen or more barges followed us, all filled with people, making a very pleasant and lively scene. My friend, Sunlight, pointed out to me, as we sailed along, all the objects of interest. The shores, as I said, were fringed with trees, some loaded with blossoms and others with fruit; they were of all forms and sizes, some presenting specimens of the most delicate and graceful shrubbery, and others shooting up in stately grandeur to an immense height. Then we would pass by cultivated fields with waving grain, and pastures enlivened with cattle and sheep, and beautiful residences with gardens of flowers and creeping vines; towns and villages were frequent, and in the background were lofty hills fading away in the blue distance. The people, as we sailed along, flocked to the water's edge to get a look at me; and I would then stand on the deck and smile upon them, making as polite bows as I knew how. After sailing through one of these lakes we came to a narrow inlet a few miles in length, the shores of which were a succession of villages; then we emerged into another lake which seemed still more beautiful than the first; and thus we proceeded on our journey from one sheet of water to another for a considerable distance.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding the many objects to interest me, I began to grow unaccountably drowsy, so that I could scarcely keep my eyes open, and then I asked my friend Sunlight if it would be contrary to etiquette in me to take a short nap.</p>
               <p>"By no means," replied he: "come down into the cabin, and rest yourself to your heart's content;"<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC5973-00000117"/> whereupon I followed him into the apartment, and threw myself on the cushions, he closing the door and giving orders that no one should disturb me.</p>
               <p>I was soon in a profound sleep, and must have slept for a considerable time, as I found on awaking and going on deck that we had entered another lake, and were in an entire new part of the country. I felt now quite refreshed, and as we approached land I very cheerfully assented to my friend's proposal that we should leave our boat, and travel some distance on foot, crossing over the isthmus to the next lake.</p>
               <p>We accordingly drew to the shore, and found it, as usual, thronged with people to look at me; for the report had now spread in all directions that a stranger from the earth had arrived, so that I did not wonder at the curiosity of the inhabitants, but thought it all very natural and proper. Having landed, I was led up to a handsome dwelling, and very hospitably entertained; after which we again proceeded along the road, through fields cultivated like gardens, and pastures filled with sheep and cattle. We conversed very gaily as we went along, Sunlight and his companions pointing out and explaining to me all the new sights, and giving me an account of the manners and customs of the people. We passed many manufactories of various kinds, and quarries also of marble and other valuable stones; and by the side of a hill near the road Sunlight stopped, and showed me a mine of the purest gold, pieces of which had been dug out, and were lying scattered upon the path.</p>
               <p>"Here," said he, "is a vein of some yellow kind of metal, which is very pretty to look at, but which we found quite too soft to be of any use; so we ceased working the mine any further, and all agreed in pronouncing it useless stuff."</p>
               <p>I eagerly stooped down to look at it, for I had never seen such a treasure before in all my live-long days, and it fairly made my eyes water to look at it.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said I, "it's worthless stuff—very worthless;" at the same time slipping a huge chunk of it in my coat tail.</p>
               <p>After journeying in this manner for some time, we came again to another lake much larger than any I had yet seen; and here we found another boat ready to receive us. In this we embarked and set sail, and Sunlight pointed to me, at the distance of fifteen or twenty miles, an island, which he said lay opposite to Moontown; and to this we would first steer, as it was well worth looking at. After visiting it we would proceed at once to the city, which lay over against it, some four miles distant. I was in high spirits at the idea of approaching the capital, of which I had heard so much; and now a drowsy feeling again came over me for which I could not account, except by supposing there was something in the quality of the air that caused it. I began to<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC5973-00000118"/> think, too, that the day was unusually long, for it seemed to me almost a week since I had swam to land, and first encountered, the Moonmen. At the suggestion of my friend I retired to the cabin, and took another comfortable nap; and on awaking and going on deek found myself quite close to the island, whose shores were fairly alive with people waiting to receive us.</p>
               <p>It was several miles in extent, surrounded with a bank wall of white marble, with steps leading up. A grove of trees of great height covered it, and the surface was laid out with grass plats, flower-beds, walks, basins, and fountains. I stepped ashore, and mounting the terrace, gazed upon the charming scene. The trees were so high that the eye could scarcely reach the leafy roof; and the rays of the sun, which here and there penetrated it, fell like golden spangles on the green sward beneath; birds of the sweetest song and richest plumage flew about overhead in all directions, and peacocks, pheasants, and other beautiful fowls, such as I had never seen before, strutted over the grounds. Tame deer and antelopes were also seen gliding about, and swans and gold fish swam in the immense marble basins amid the glittering spray and falling water of hundreds of fountains. Multitudes of men, women, and children were promenading amid these fairy scenes, or feasting under the arbours. I was, of course, an object of great interest to them, and as I crossed over the garden they gathered round me in great crowds. When I got to the opposite side, the view of the city burst upon me. It was across the channel, about three miles distant, and lay upon the slope of a hill; the houses were of white stone, with flat roofs, adorned with flower-pots and small trees and shrubs set out in boxes. In front was a wide quay or terrace, also of white stone, with steps descending to the water. It extended a great distance up and down the shore, and the surface of the lake was enlivened with boats moving about in all directions.</p>
               <p>The king's barge was now ready to receive me, being the largest and handsomest I had yet seen; and in this I embarked, and the oarsmen plying their oars, we shot over the water towards Moontown.</p>
               <p>As we drew nigh the city, I perceived throngs of people on the roofs and also on the quay, among whom, as I was informed, were the king and queen. In due time we arrived, and I was most cordially received by the royal party, who took me up to the palace, where a handsome collation had been prepared. Having satisfied my appetite, I was placed on a seat between my polite hosts, to whom I gave a detailed account of my journey to the moon, and of all the circumstances attending it, thanking them for the kind and noble reception I had met with. They now questioned me about the earth, its inhabitants, manners, and customs; to which I replied as<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC5973-00000119"/> well as my limited knowledge and experience would admit.</p>
               <p>"And, pray," asked the king, "how are your people governed? for such a wise and enlightened race as you appear to be, must have excellent modes of government."</p>
               <p>"Why, as to that," said I, "kings and queens have usually governed us; but, latterly, this method has gone out of use, and rams are being introduced."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Chipo!" interrupted the queen, raising her hands in astonishment; "you do not mean rams, certainly, but sheep? Your wise men point to the sheep as patterns of innocence, harmlessness, and peace; and the gentle-minded people, taking the hint, copy after these guileless creatures, and govern themselves accordingly."</p>
               <p>On hearing this speech, I could not help bursting into a fit of laughter at the poor woman's simplicity.</p>
               <p>"Madam," said I, "the rams I speak of have precious little of the sheep about them, as you will confess, yourself, when your hear them described. They are made of iron, and are nearly as long as this city. Their insides are filled brimfull of fire and brim-stone, rosin, hot steam, and I know not what; they dart ahead like a streak of lightning, and, at one stroke, will kill you as many people as yonder vast crowd on the quay."</p>
               <p>On hearing this, the king and queen raised their hands in amazement, and the hair of their heads stood straight up.</p>
               <p>"These dreadful scenes," said the king, "arise from your vast and expansive minds: for gigantic minds must have gigantic passions. Of course, they do not last long: for you have peace-makers among you, no doubt, who step in, and soon restore everything to tranquillity."</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied I, "we have our peace-makers, too; and of them I was about to speak, had you not interrupted me."</p>
               <p>"Go on, good Chipo," said the queen; "I was almost ready to faint, listening to these bloody cruelties; but what you say now, somewhat refreshes me: go on, then, and tell us what these peace-makers do, and who they are."</p>
               <p>"They are long tubes of iron," returned I, "as big as one of your barges; they are filled with gunpowder, and carry a ball almost as large as a hogshead, which rakes down whole regiments of men; nothing can stand before them; they calm all opposition, and give every thing its quietus: hence, we call them peace-makers."</p>
               <p>"Oh, shocking!" exclaimed the king and queen both together; "how shall we convert you from these inhuman practices? We must open communication with your country, and send thither a band of missionaries."</p>
               <p>"Missionaries to us!" said I; why, that's a pretty<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC5973-00000120"/> joke! Missionaries belong to Africa; and there we send them ourselves by ship-loads: for there they really need them, on account of their heathenish customs."</p>
               <p>"I know nothing about Africa," returned the queen; "but, if their customs are any worse than your own, they must be heathenish indeed. But, come, let us dismiss these gloomy subjects, and divert ourselves a little with a sail on the lake."</p>
               <p>Upon this, we rose up to go to the quay, and went aboard of the king's barge; a great crowd followed us down; and, when I stood upon the roof of the cabin, thousands, were gazing at me. The king told me it would be a great gratification to the people, if I would make an address to them. I had never made a speech in, my life, and felt myself in the most awkward position I had ever been in: however, as I had been treated so civilly, I thought it would never do to seem disobliging; so, taking off my cap, and clearing my throat, I thus began:</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen Moonmen: I thank you most heartily for your kindness towards me since I dropped in among you. Such generous people I never met, in all my life; nor such beautiful lakes, nor gardens, nor towns, nor cities, nor barges; nor such a noble king and queen. But, now, turn your heads up, and look at my country: it seems mighty small—you might cover it with your hands; but appearances are deceptive: it's big, I tell you. You see those little islands yonder: you might put a dozen moons in one of them without crowding. That dark triangular thing is South America; and the black line, running up and down it, is the Andes; that high peak is Chimborazo; and were we a little nearer, I could show you the very rock I jumped from, and, perhaps, even the print of my shoes in the snow." (Here some of my audience cried out that they could see them very plainly.) "I've no doubt of it," continued I; "not a particle: for I must say, you are the most sharp-sighted, sagacious, long-headed, prudent, and wise people, I ever met with in all my life." And so saying, I darted into the cabin, the crowd loudly applauding me, and saying my speech was, without exception, the most learned and finished piece of eloquence they had ever listened to.</p>
               <p>The king and queen embraced me, congratulating me on my masterly performance; and we now pushed off from the quay, sailing in front of the city, of which all the interesting buildings were pointed out to me. Having landed at the upper part of the town, we came out on a very broad and beautiful street, down which we proceeded, and again entered the palace. Here a fit of drowsiness again came over me, and it seemed as if the day was never coming to an end; for never in my life had I experienced one so long; but of this I said nothing to my kind hosts, fearing they would look upon it as impolite. I threw myself on a couch,<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC5973-00000121"/> and took a long and comfortable nap, from which I arose quite refreshed, and again amused myself, to my heart's content, in observing all the strange sights with which I was surrounded. But every thing, at last, must come to an end; and so did this day, which now began to draw to a close—the sun setting, and a beautiful bright moonlight, if I may so call it, shedding its silvery rays over the scene.</p>
               <p>Every one now prepared to retire; for I observed that the people were all very regular in their habits, and kept good hours. The queen lighted a lamp, and escorted me to my chamber, observing that, in the morning, she would show me still more of the city; and hoping that I would rise pretty early, as there was yet a great deal to see, and the days were very short; but, in this last remark, I by no means agreed with her. However, I thanked her kindly for all her attentions, telling her she must not stand on any kind of ceremony, but come and knock at my door early, for I was, as she must have perceived, a drowsy creature, and would, probably, sleep till noon, if I was not awakened.</p>
               <p>There was in the inmost part of the palace a chamber called the pavilion, with high walls and lighted by a skylight; it was very snug and comfortable and handsomely furnished; to this the queen led me, telling me it was in a retired position and that I would here be free from all intrusion; and after bidding me good-night, and in order, as I suppose pose, to render me still more secure, she turned the key of the door upon me and locked me in.</p>
               <p>I was very tired and threw myself on the luxurious bed, determining to have a good night of it. I did not, however, get to sleep at once, but lay revolving in my mind all that had happened to me during this long and eventful day; during which, I had passed through more wonderful scenes than, I verily believe, ever happened to any human being before. I thought what a marvellous journey I had from the Chimborazo: how I had tumbled into the lake and swam ashore, of my first interview with the Moonmen and how strange every thing had appeared to me, of the beautiful scenes I had beheld, of the throngs of people I had met, and the questions I had asked and answered, and last, but not least, of the speech I had made from the top of the boat; and when I reflected on the arrant nonsense I had uttered, and of the avidity with which my auditors had swallowed it, I gave way to such fits of laughter as fairly made the bed shake.</p>
               <p>I wondered, also, what new scenes were still before me, and what part I was destined to enact; being resolved, however, to trust to Providence, to keep as light a heart as I could, and to make the best of every thing. In the midst of these cogitations I fell asleep, and long and sound were my slumbers; so that on awaking I feared I had over slept myself, and expected every moment to hear<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC5973-00000122"/> some one thundering at my door, and telling me to get up.</p>
               <p>But on looking at the skylight I saw, with surprise, that it was not yet day, and tried again to compose myself to sleep; but this I found it impossible to do, so I resolved to lie still and watch till the dawn appeared. I waited a long time, but could perceive no symptoms of it, and listened if I might hear the chickens beginning to crow, or some movement of the servants in the kitchen; but nothing of the kind could be distinguished, and the only sound I heard was a continual snoring from the inmates of the house; which went on, as it were in concert, like the peal of some vast organ. "However," said I, "day break must come at last;" and I kept my eyes on the skylight, trying whether I could discover any signs of it. I watched hour after hour, but all to no purpose. "Certainly," said I, "there must be an eclipse, or a great fog, or this must be one of those dark days such as happened many years ago." I resolved now that I would get up and dress myself and take a turn in the entry, for I was getting so tired of waiting that I could stand it no longer. I, therefore, got out of bed, and having put on my clothes, went to the door to make my exit; but what was my horror to find it locked, for the queen, in order to keep me from being disturbed, had turned the key on me.</p>
               <p>This unexpected event threw me all back; I lost my patience and gave the door a series of such violent kicks that I feel the effects of them in my feet to this very day. But I might as well have kept my temper, for the door did not yield an inch; nor did the noise appear to disturb in the least the slumbers of any one, as I could hear the snorings still going on as happily as ever. I called now, as loud as I could bawl, for some one to come and let me out; but no one answered; I then threw my boots at the skylight, producing such a crash of broken glass as I thought would even awake a deaf man, but all availed nothing. "Well," said I, "this is certainly vexations, but I suppose it's my destiny, and what's the use of struggling against it; I'll turn into bed again and try and compose myself to bear it as well as I can."</p>
               <p>I now began to think that perhaps I was asleep, and that the whole thing might be a dream, a horrid nightmare, possibly brought on by eating so much fruit and milk, to which I was unaccustomed, and which I now feared would be the death of me; the next thing was, how shall I wake myself? and this I tried to do by biting my fingers till they fairly ran, with blood. All this, however, produced no good results, so I lay as quiet as I could, determining to see it out and watch how the whole thing would end.</p>
               <p>How long I lay in this state I know not, but it seemed almost an age, till at last a craving hunger<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC5973-00000123"/> seized me, rousing me from my torpor and forcing me to get up. I ripped open the pillows and began chewing the feathers, but this afforded me small relief; and starved and exhausted I threw myself again on the bed, moaning and groaning most piteously.</p>
               <p>I began, at length, to grow very weak and fell into a sort of stupor, which must have lasted a long time, and from which I was at last aroused by the voice of the queen; who, having unlocked the door, put her head in the room and inquired if I was not almost ready to get up.</p>
               <p>"Ah, madam," said I, "long, long ago I was ready to get up, but now I fear it's all over with me, and that I shall never get up."</p>
               <p>"Why, my dear Chipo," returned she, "what in the world ails you? was not your bed comfortable—were not the pillows good?"</p>
               <p>"Yes!" exclaimed I; "so good that I even devoured them; just see how I have been chewing the feathers."</p>
               <p>She looked at the feathers and at the broken glass on the floor, and thus continued:</p>
               <p>"My good friend," said she, "judging from appearances, you must have passed as restless night."</p>
               <p>"Restless," cried I, "you may well say so; I have had a dozen nightmares, cold sweats, terrible oppressions and horrid dreams; I have been starved, scared, pinched, stung and bit."</p>
               <p>"Not bit," said the queen, "that's impossible."</p>
               <p>"Is it?" exclaimed I, jumping out of bed and showing her my bloody hands. The sight astonished her very much, and she begged me to lie down on the bed again whilst she went to get some hartshorn.</p>
               <p>"Excuse me," said I, going to the door; "I lie no more on that bed, twelve hours in this room is quite enough for me."</p>
               <p>"Twelve hours!" replied the lady, "you mean, twenty-eight days; for that is the length of time you have been here."</p>
               <p>"Twenty-eight days!" exclaimed I; "have I been twenty-eight days in purgatory? Ah, madam, it's no wonder I am half dead, let me out of this place or I shall go distracted."</p>
               <p>"Alas, Chipo," said the queen, giving me her arm; "I thought you knew our days and nights were twenty-eight times the length of yours."</p>
               <p>"What care I for the length of your days or nights either?" answered I; "it was your locking me in the room that caused all the mischief. But come, lead me out of this infernal den and give me a morsel to eat, for I solemnly declare I'm almost starved."</p>
               <p>She very kindly took me, to the pantry, and set before me an abundance of delicacies, to which I sat down with a ravenous appetite; then she went, as I supposed, to her husband, to relate to him all that had occurred; for I heard him, in the adjoining<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC5973-00000124"/> joining room, roaring with laughter. When I had finished my repast, the king came in, and bidding me good-morning, asked me how I had rested, and if I did not find the paviion very snug and comfortable.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes," answered I, "it's very comfortable and snug, no doubt, especially when it's locked on the outside; and as for my night's rest, the least said, the soonest mended." I spoke in this manner, to let my host know, that I wished to have no further conversation on the subject; for the recollection of what I had suffered was so horrible, that I scarcely dared to let my thoughts dwell upon it.</p>
               <p>I was glad, however, that I had become acquainted with the length of their days, as I could now govern myself accordingly; and I, also, very readily accounted for the fits of drowsiness that had afflicted me, and which I was, heretofore, so sorely puzzled to explain. In the meanwhile, events followed one another in quick succession; and I enjoyed myself greatly among these kind people, whom I liked more and more, the longer I knew them.</p>
               <p>At length, another day drew to a close; and I saw them all making preparations to retire to rest—the queen asking me if I again wished to sleep in the pavilion.</p>
               <p>"Devil take the pavilion!" said I; "the very name of it makes me shudder! nor would I put my foot in it again for all the gold mines of Peru."</p>
               <p>My good hostess smiled at my warmth, replying that I might have any other room in the house that was most agreeable to me; or, if I preferred it, I need not go to bed at all.</p>
               <p>"That is precisely what I intend to do," answered I; "I will see all the rest of you comfortably disposed of, and sit up myself and mind the house; and when I feel any way drowsy, will just take a little nap in one of these easy chairs."</p>
               <p>To this the lady very cheerfully assented, adding, that she would set out a table for me, furnished with refreshments, so that I should not want for creature comforts during the long interval. Every thing being arranged, the king and queen prepared to retire; first, bidding me good-night, and telling me to take care of myself, and, above all things, to allow neither hunger nor nightmare to approach me. In this merry mood did my friends leave me, little knowing what a nightmare they, themselves, were destined to undergo before morning. But I must not anticipate.</p>
               <p>Every one in the palace, and, indeed, in the whole city, was soon asleep, and the snoring, which I had heard the previous night, again commenced. "With this exception, there was no stir nor sound whatever—all was silent; and I soon commenced examining and eating, too, the dainties which the good queen had provided. Having finished my meal, I began to meditate what I should do to pass away the time; and came to the conclusion that I would not spend<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC5973-00000125"/> it idly in my apartment, but look about me, and gain all the information I could; for, since every one now, was asleep, I had a capital chance to do so, which I was resolved not to lose; for I was naturally of an inquiring mind. It is true, the Moonmen were frank and candid, and had always answered my questions without reserve; yet, still, I was convinced there were many things of which I was still ignorant; and I resolved to take advantage of my present situation, and investigate matters a little more closely than I had before.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, having, as I said, finished my supper, and examined the parlour and its beautiful furniture, I put on my cap, and, mounting two or three pair of stairs, came out, through a trap-door, on to the roof.</p>
               <p>The night was charming; the sky clear and serene; and every thing was bathed in a soft moonlight just like ours, only much more vivid. I walked over the platform admiring the pleasant and tranquil scene; going from house to house, and from block to block, by means of the bridges that were thrown across the streets, connecting, as it were, the whole town together. Thus, like a rambling cat, whilst the whole population was immersed in profound sleep, did I perambulate the roofs of this vast city, with my ears ready to catch the least sound, and my eyes on the look-out, if, by chance, they might encounter any thing worthy of notice.</p>
               <p>Suddenly, I saw, among the hills in the interior, a great light. I wondered much what could be the cause of it; thinking, at first, it might be a bonfire, or some one burning brush; though, when I reflected again, neither of these seemed to be likely; but whatever it might be, I was resolved to investigate it; so I proceeded rapidly along till I came near the end of the town, when I descended by one of the stairs, and got into the highway. I walked on, keeping my eyes fixed on the light, which seemed to grow brighter; and, as I got among the hills, I began to distinguish strange sounds in the distance. Curious to discover what all this meant, I hurried along; and, after proceeding three or four miles, my farther passage was stopped by a huge wall, from within which the blaze and noises issued.</p>
               <p>The wall was most massive, and seemed to be at least sixty feet high. I walked close up; and, placing my ear against the stones, heard such a hubbub as I had never before encountered in all my days. "What can be the meaning of all this? said I; and who would have thought of any thing like this existing in Moonland? I made a circuit of the wall for some distance, and found it to inclose a space of great magnitude; and longed very much to get to the top of it, in order that I might see what kind of a place it was, and what was the cause of all the commotion. At length, I spied a tall tree which grew close to the inclosure: up this tree I managed,<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC5973-00000126"/> with some difficulty to climb; and, creeping out on a limb, I let myself down on the coping of the wall, which I found wide enough for four men to walk abreast.</p>
               <p>But, what a spectacle met my eyes. Several clusters of habitations or villages were scattered over the surface; one of which was in flames, and nearly burnt up. A concourse of men, mingled together, with weapons in their hands, occupied the vacant space: a grand fight was going on; and such a clashing of arms, such a shouting and clamour rose in the air, as almost deafened me. I sat with my legs hanging over the cornice, and gazed upon the scene in silent amazement. At length, one of the men caught a glimpse of me, and pointed me out to the rest. Then they all rushed to the wall showering their missiles upon me, and crying out, "A Moonman, a Moonman! kill him, kill him!" so that I, quickly drew up my legs, and moved a little back.</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen," said I, "what is the meaning of this rancour? I am sure I have done nothing to deserve it, nor would I hurt a hair of your heads on any account."</p>
               <p>"You are a rascally Moonman," they cried out again.</p>
               <p>"Not at all," answered I; "I'm Chipo Capaac the Peruvian, blown off in a gale of wind from the top of Chimborazo; and as for the Moonmen I left them but five minutes ago, fast asleep, snoring away in the most happy innocence; nor do I like to hear my good friends called rascals, for I have lived with them now over a month, and better people I never met with."</p>
               <p>One of the men, who appeared to be a leader, now stepped from the crowd and spoke:</p>
               <p>"Excuse us, sir," said he, "for our mistake: we took you for one of our enemies, but we now perceive our error, and see very plainly that you are an honest gentleman like ourselves."</p>
               <p>"I am not given to flattery," I answered, "but I must say, though you are somewhat noisy and turbulent, yet I like your looks; and your villages, your weapons, and dress put me more in mind of my own country than any thing I have seen since I left Peru. But pray tell me a few things I long to know: why are you engaged in this deadly strife, for which I can see no reason whatever? and why do you live separated from the rest of the Moonmen, in this retired place, which, you must excuse me for saying so, looks very much like a jail or penitentiary."</p>
               <p>"The matter is easily explained," said the man; "the Moonmen, say we are mad, and shut us up in this place to keep us from doing mischief; but the fact is we are no more mad than they are. Do I talk to you, sir, like a madman?"</p>
               <p>"Quite the contrary," returned I; "you talk most coherently and rationally, and I am at a loss to conceive<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC5973-00000127"/> ceive how your countryman should take up such an opinion of you."</p>
               <p>"The reason is this," answered the man: "we do not concur in all their ideas and notions, but like to have the privilege of thinking and acting for ourselves. For instance, the Moonmen like to retire early to rest, and to have the city closed at a certain hour. This did not suit us, for we loved to sit up as last as we chose, or if we preferred it not to go to bed at all; and indeed we did not like any of their sleeping customs, which we considered quite preposterous, as we found it far more agreeable to ramble about and enjoy these pleasant moonlights; for we thought the nights long enough in all conscience."</p>
               <p>"There I most cordially agree with you," said I; "and if not liking their sleeping customs be a sign of madness, then I must be as mad as a March hare, for I think them not only preposterous but diabolical."</p>
               <p>"Besides this," continued the speaker, "they find fault with us for being too pugnacious, and sometimes getting up fights and battles, one of which we have even now been engaged in, having slaughtered all the people of yonder village, and then set it on fire; but we had good cause for all we did, for never was there a more righteous war, as I will soon explain to you."</p>
               <p>"Spare your pains," said I, "for I have been in war myself, and know all about them. The last I fought in was a long and bloody one, though what it was all about I cannot for the life of me say; but this I know, that we slaughtered thousands, and after burning up a town ten times as big as yours, we returned home very comfortably and triumphantly; nor did any one ever call in question what we had done, or find fault with our bloody work, or if they did I never heard of it. But pray tell me, my friend, who is that yonder with a big sword in his hand, and a bunch of feathers in his cap, for he looks confoundedly like my old captain, and struts just as he did after a victory?"</p>
               <p>"That is old Fury," replied the other; "a renowned general, and the pride of his country; he knows the whole art of war, and is now returning in triumph from the slaughter, his clothes stained with carnage, and his very pockets filled with blood."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" said I, "there he is at fault, and shows he is not yet master of his art; for generals now a days return from the war with their pockets filled with something else than blood. Yonder, too, is another personage whose face I should know, for I have certainly seen him before: he is swinging something in his hand, and is reeling towards the wall as if he wished to speak to me: he intends to tell me, I suppose, why he is shut up in this place."</p>
               <p>By this time the figure had approached the wall, and looking up told me that his name was Harlequin, and that he had been placed in confinement<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC5973-00000128"/> on account of an old habit he had of leaning against posts and corners, and sometimes of measuring his length on the ground; or, in other words, that he liked now and then a social glass; and concluded by asking me if I thought there was any harm in it.</p>
               <p>"Not in the least," returned I, "provided you use it in moderation; and if you could only pass your jug up to me, I would drink your health with a bumper."</p>
               <p>This speech put him in fine humour, and, placing his bottle to his mouth, he smacked his lips, and danced off in high glee.</p>
               <p>The next that came up was an old man, with a long nose and cunning eye, carrying a big bag on his shoulders. He began by telling me his name was Old Hunks, and that the Moonmen had shut him up on account of a taste he had for making collections; and asked me if I thought there was any thing wrong in that.</p>
               <p>"Not in the least," said I, "but on the contrary you deserve much praise for indulging a taste so innocent and laudable; but tell me what kind of collections do you make—minerals or shells, or some other little nick-nacks?"</p>
               <p>"I collect little round pieces of gold," answered he; "you may call them nick-nacks in your country, but here we call them doubloons;" and so saying, he put his hand in the bag, and drew out a handful to show me.</p>
               <p>"Oh," said I, "I have seen these kind of yellow boys myself very often, though I never succeeded in getting many of them; but such a pile I never saw before in all my life. What in the world are you-going to do with them? But perhaps you are head of the treasury, or hold these vast sums in trust for others."</p>
               <p>"Not so," replied the old man; "I hold them in trust for no one but myself."</p>
               <p>"You have probably a large and expensive family," continued I, "and require these great treasures to support them."</p>
               <p>"I have no family at all," answered the other, "but an old cat; and hardly spend one of these pieces in a whole year."</p>
               <p>"Oh I see how it is," said I, "you are some generous philanthropist, collecting for charity; and will, one of these days, found a hospital."</p>
               <p>He made me no answer to this, except a horrible grin, and tightening the string of his bag, he placed it one his shoulders, and moved off.</p>
               <p>The next that came up was a solemn, demure-looking personage, with an air as if the whole universe rested upon him; and when I asked him what was his offence, he told me he had been confined as a busybody.</p>
               <p>"But this," continued he, "is an outrageous calumny; 'tis true I busied myself to do good and<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC5973-00000129"/> reform people; for I saw the whole world was wrong, and felt that I had a mission to set it right."</p>
               <p>"That was an excellent object," said I, "and I suppose you first commenced by setting yourself right."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I never thought of that;" answered the man, "and the fact is I shouldn't have had time for it, even if I had, so busy, was I with others."</p>
               <p>"However," continued I, "you gave a good example, at any rate. For instance; you never cheated any one, nor told a lie, nor beat your wife, nor neglected your children, nor got drunk."</p>
               <p>These questions made him scratch his head; however he went on to tell me that he was troubled with colics, and required now and then a little stimulus; that as for cheating, he had to do it occasionally, in self-defence; and that he never lied but when it suited his purpose; that his wife was a perfect Tartar, and needed now and then a little correction; and as for his children they had all run away from him.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Mr. Busybody," said I, "I know who you are well enough: you are one of those would-be reformers, who would assist Providence in governing the world, yet cannot govern yourselves; I think the Moonmen are quite right in keeping you a week or two in limbo."</p>
               <p>"Ah," said he, "a week or two I would not mind, but I am shut up here for life."</p>
               <p>"And so are we all," shouted a hundred voices.</p>
               <p>"It's very melancholy," said I, "and I must candidly confess the Moonmen treat you rather hardly; and as for the excuse they set up of your being madmen, it's a downright falsehood, and that I'll swear to before judge and jury."</p>
               <p>By this time a great crowd had gathered at the foot of the wall, begging me to set them free; whereupon I told them that as soon as it was morning I would lay the matter before the Moonmen, and use all my influence to further their wishes. But this did not suit them, for they said the Moonmen would never consent; and that there was but one way of accomplishing the object.</p>
               <p>"Pray what is it?" asked I, "for nothing would give more pleasure than obliging you."</p>
               <p>"Yonder," replied they, "is the gate; the key of it is in the king's chamber beside his bed; you have only to get possession of it, unlock the gate, and the thing's done."</p>
               <p>I did not like much getting the key in this furtive manner; but, thought I, it will be the means of freeing these poor people, who I verily believe are most unjustly dealt with, and that I'm sure will be a good work. I accordingly told them to keep quiet, and I would see what could be done; and so saying, I descended from the wall by the same means that I had ascended, and getting into the highway proceeded to the city.</p>
               <pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC5973-00000130"/>
               <p>The people were all in a profound slumber, just as when I left them, so that I entered the palace without any difficulty; and reached the king's chamber. I found the key hanging by the bed, and took possession of it; it was made of iron, and was of immense size, being almost as large as my arm. I felt overjoyed at having secured it, and getting again into the road, made the best of my way to the residence of my new acquaintances, and having climbed the tree I stepped upon the wall, holding up the key in full view. The sight of the key set them almost beside themselves; cries and joyous vociferations broke forth, and they clamoured to me to hurry down and open the door.</p>
               <p>"Be calm, gentlemen," said I, "be calm: this is a matter of weighty import, and is not to be done in a hurried manner. I am assuming a vast responsibility, and do not know how I shall answer it to the Moonmen, who may after all have good and cogent reasons for confining you. It is true you have talked to me very handsomely; you have given me pretty words, but how do I know you will carry them out? for, as the proverb says, 'Pretty is that pretty does."</p>
               <p>"Tell us quick," replied they, "what you are driving at, and what it is you want?"</p>
               <p>"Why," returned!, "I want you to behave in a quiet, gentle manner; and when I open the gate not to rush out like a parcel of wild Indians, but to come forth one at a time, and then falling into regular order you are to enter the city as softly as possible, being careful not to awaken the Moonmen, nor disturb their slumbers in the least; but in all respects to demean yourselves like gentlemen, giving an example of perfect order and propriety."</p>
               <p>"This we all promise to do," they replied.</p>
               <p>"Nay," said I, "that's not enough: you must all raise up your hands and swear it with a solemn oath: which, if you break, you will be reprobate villians, and liable for perjury."</p>
               <p>They gave the oath in a moment, and told me to go ahead; whereupon I descended from the wall, and proceeded to the gate, putting the key in the lock.</p>
               <p>"Now," said I, "remember your oath; I will open the door just wide enough for one to pass through at a time, and let there be no pressing nor crowding."</p>
               <p>They cried out, "Aye! aye!" and I turned the key, and shot back the bolt.</p>
               <p>In a moment the door flew open, and out they all rushed like a torrent, trampling me to the ground, and passing over my body with no more scruple nor compunction than if I were a log of wood.</p>
               <p>"Oh you graceless villains!" exclaimed I, "is this the way you keep your oaths? Where is your truth, your honesty, your conscience? Perjury! perjury! perjury!"</p>
               <p>In this manner did I rebuke them, but I might as<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC5973-00000131"/> well have spoken to the winds, and indeed had much ado to prevent being trampled to death. At length, however, I managed to get up and stand on my feet, running by the side of them, tapping their heads with the key, and begging them for heaven's sake to slacken their pace, and not enter the city in such a tumultuous manner.</p>
               <p>They paid no attention, however, to my words; but scampered along the road, hallooing and shouting so violently that they might have been heard miles off. Oh, said I, what will the poor Moonmen think of all this! how their slumbers will be broken up, and what a night they will have of it! I ran with all my might to get into town as soon as possible, so that I might use my influence in keeping these wild people in some kind of order, but my efforts were fruitless; and when I reached the place, I found that they had taken possession of it, and that the terrified inhabitants, aware of their approach, had fled to their barges, and sailed over to the island. A small skiff was lying at the quay; and, jumping into it, I paddled across the strait.</p>
               <p>I found the island crowded with the Moonmen, and the king and queen standing on the beach to meet me.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Chipo," exclaimed they, "what a piece of business you have been doing! Did you travel all the way from the earth on such a mission as this? to set these madmen free, and turn our peaceful city into a bedlam?"</p>
               <p>"My good friends," returned I; "they are not madmen at all; but as sound-minded as you and I. I had a long and interesting conversation with them, and have heard and seen things that have put me more in mind of Peru than any thing I have witnessed since I left home."</p>
               <p>"Oh, just look at them!" exclaimed the queen: "they have got possession of the palace, and are capering and dancing on the roof."</p>
               <p>"And is it to be wondered at," said I, "that they are somewhat joyous and merry? I'm sure it would almost make me dance on my head to be set free from such a place as they were confined in."</p>
               <p>"See!" said the king, "they are setting the town on fire! go back, Chipo, and try what you can do with them."</p>
               <p>I looked, and saw, indeed, that the king was right, as vast clouds of smoke were already beginning to arise; so, without saying a word, I leaped into the boat, and proceeded to the city.</p>
               <p>It presented a strange spectacle. The new occupants had already taken possession of every thing they could lay their hands on, and were beginning to quarrel about the spoils. They were roving about the streets, ransacking every house, and turning every thing topsy-turvy; some were fighting on the roofs, and others, as I have just said, had fired the<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC5973-00000132"/> buildings. Such tumult and confusion I never before witnessed. I stepped ashore; and, running among them, tried to! bring them to reason. They told me to mind my own business, and commenced calling me a "Moonman."</p>
               <p>"That is false," said I, "and you know it. I'm no Moonman, but Chipo Capaac, the Peruvian, blown in a gale of wind from the top of Chimborazo, as I told you before from the top of the wall. Then you talked very differently to me, and were sweeter than sugar and honey. At the risk of my neck, I let you all out of prison, and this is the thanks I get for it. Come down from those roofs, you jailbirds," exclaimed I, raising my voice, "and put out that fire directly, or I'll have you all indicted for arson, homicide, and burglary."</p>
               <p>They made no reply to this, except showering upon my head and shoulders a volley of tiles and flower-pots, which bruised me severely, and brought my harangue to a very speedy close. I then stepped from the wharf, and got again into the boat, and, shaking my first at them as I left, paddled across the strait.</p>
               <p>The king and queen were on the shore of the island waiting for me, and asked what king of a reception I had met with.</p>
               <p>"A very marked one, indeed," said I, pointing to the bruises on my head and shoulders; upon seeing which, serious as the matter was, they could not forbear bear laughing. "But never mind," said I; "let me alone, and I'll manage them yet; I know them like a book, and will bring them to their bearings before long, or my name's not Chipo." I then called for my friend Sunlight, who soon appeared.</p>
               <p>"Sunlight," said I, "you remember a yellow metal which we met by the side of a mountain, on our journey to Moontown, and which you pronounced worthless stuff? here is a specimen of it which I picked up, and have been carrying in my coat-tail to this very day. Lead me with all haste to the spot, and I'll show you it's not the worthless stuff you imagine; but, on the contrary, a potent medicine for many evils, and a specific of vast power and virtue."</p>
               <p>I then asked the king to furnish me with a barge and a dozen of his best artizans, telling him that I had a scheme by which these wild people would soon be cleared from the city, and every thing restored to order and quiet. The king wondered much what I was driving at; however, he furnished me the boat and every thing I required; and Sunlight, with myself and the workmen, jumped into it, and pushed from the shore, amid the good wishes of the multitude. We passed over several lakes, and through the channels, and came, at last, to the gold mine, which, as I said, was in the side of a mountain close to the road. We all jumped ashore; and I gave orders to the workmen to build a forge, and<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC5973-00000133"/> prepare iron implements for rolling and cutting. Others, meanwhile, with their picks, dug out the ore; the fire was lit, the bellows started, the gold smelted, rolled, and cut into pieces as near like doubloons as I could make them. Having made as many of these as I thought necessary, I tied them up in a stout bag, and, throwing them into the boat, we all embarked, and, in due time, got back to the island.</p>
               <p>I now proceeded to carry out my scheme, the king and queen and all the people watching every thing I did with great interest and surprise. I disguised myself as an old man, sticking on my face a white woolly beard, with a slouched hat, a threadbare cloak, and a staff in my hand. I then jumped into the skiff with my bag of gold, and ferried myself, to the city. The occupants, though noisy enough, had still somewhat settled down from the riotous excitement they had first shown; and I managed to thread my way through the boisterous crowd to the great square in the centre of the town.</p>
               <p>I took my seat on one of the steps of the houses, and began setting up such a series of moans and groans as I think would have almost started a dead man into life. The people gathered round me, thinking I was Old Hunks; for I had disguised myself to look like him even to his very beard and staff.</p>
               <p>"Why Old Hunks," said they, "what makes you carry on in this style? is there not tumult enough without your joining in?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I'm going, I'm going," said I; "such cramps, such a colic, such dreadful sensations."</p>
               <p>"Pooh, pooh," answered the crowd, "you're not going at all; keep up your spirits, old fellow, and get up from these cold stones; you'll live till a hundred at least, and for many a long year yet will enjoy your gold."</p>
               <p>"Gold!" cried I, "what's a dead man got to do with gold? come, boys, help yourselves;" and so saying I scattered a handful of the coin among them, which they scrambled for with the greatest avidity. I then rose up, and proceeding a few steps along the street, groaning and moaning as I went, I threw down some more, which increased the excitement so that a great crowd gathered round me from all quarters.</p>
               <p>The news soon spread through the city that Old Hunks had lost his wits, and was throwing his doubloons about as if they were oyster-shells. Every one flocked to the spot to get a share of the spoil, and I gradually moved along the street to the entrance of the town, throwing handfuls of gold as I went.</p>
               <p>The whole population followed, not a soul remained; and by little and little I got them into the highway which led to the hills. It was amusing to see the eagerness they displayed; how they scrambled<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC5973-00000134"/> bled, and fought, and rolled on the ground, and tumbled upon each other, those in the rear jumping over the backs of those in front like a shoal of minnows darting out of water. Thus, like a farmer's wife, scattering her corn and coaxing her chickens into the coop, did I gradually entice these greedy people to their former dwelling-place. I then took my stand on the threshold of the gate, throwing in the coin till I saw them all cleverly entered, then I pitched what remained, bag and all, as far into the enclosure as I possibly could, and suddenly slipping out I slammed to the door, and turning the key which I had brought along, I snugly locked them all in.</p>
               <p>In a few moments they discovered that they were prisoners, and came thundering at the gate, calling to me to let them out. I stood to listen, and heard a voice at the keyhole addressing me, whom I recognized as the would-be reformer or busybody.</p>
               <p>"Chipo," said he, "this is a mean, shabby, earthy trick."</p>
               <p>"It's not as earthy as those flower-pots you bruised my head and shoulders with," returned I.</p>
               <p>"Let us out," continued he, "and I promise you shall have no cause to complain of us hereafter; from this moment we will commence a new era, for I will make it my special mission to go among these people and reform them."</p>
               <p>Get along, you vagabond," said I, "and reform yourself and your children, and give up beating your wife; this is the proper place for you; the Moonmen are quite right in keeping you all in limbo; here you are and here you'll stay, as sure as my name's Chipo Capaac."</p>
               <p>So saying, I marched off and returned to the city, which was now all quiet and deserted. I got into a boat and soon reached the island, where I found the king and queen anxiously awaiting me. I told them my scheme had succeeded admirably, that the city was now evacuated, and that those riotous people were securely caged and would trouble them no more. They were all loud in my praise, declaring that they had never seen any thing so ingeniously managed, nor could they ever have imagined that gold would work such wonders. I told them they had not seen one half that it would do; and that I could tell them things about it that would almost make them jump out of their skins in astonishment. We now stepped into the barge, and in a little while the whole population returned joyfully to the town; which, after some time employed in repairing, was restored to its former comfort and beauty.</p>
               <p>I remained, after this, a considerable time with these good people, and at length began to think seriously of returning to my own country; but this, as you may imagine, was a matter of some difficulty. After cogitating the subject a long while, I decided to rig up a light basket, something like the car of a<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC5973-00000135"/> balloon, to which I would attach a number of the swans or geese, with which as I said before, all the lakes were so plentifully stocked. These, I thought, with judicious management; I could get to fly up in the air, and thus transport my vehicle with myself in it, to the planet to which I belonged. I accordingly made known my resolution to the king, and asked his permission for the use of the fowls, and for materials to construct the machine; all of which he readily granted, saying, moreover, that he would like to accompany me; for nothing would give him greater pleasure than making a short visit to the earth, the account I had given him of it having so much interested him and excited his curiosity. He, therefore, inquired if it would be possible for him to be accomodated and accompany me as a fellow-passenger.</p>
               <p>I told him that nothing was easier, and that all that was necessary would be to make the machine a little larger; but that it would require a double number of geese. He told me I was welcome to all the geese in his dominions, at which I burst out laughing, and asked him what he would do with the queen.</p>
               <p>"Oh," replied he, "we will not let her know any thing about it; she is a good-natured body, and when I return I will tell her I took the voyage for the sake of my health, and did not let her know of my departure for fear of alarming her."</p>
               <p>We accordingly began to make our arrangements, and appropriated one of the garrets of the palace, which we converted into a workshop wherein to construct our machine. We collected a quantity of osiers and strong silk cords, and, locking ourselves in the apartment, sat to work very diligently.</p>
               <p>It was our custom to retire to the room at a certain hour every day, and, plaiting the willows together and securing them with the cords, our machine was gradually built up, not a soul in the place knowing what was going on. At last, however, the queen began to miss us and seemed to suspect that something was in the wind to which she was not privy. Her curiosity was excited and she at last found out where we repaired every day, and inquired of her husband what in the world he and Chipo were doing so much in the garret? The king replied that we went there to study astronomy, in which, he said, I was a great adept; and that we retired to that spot as it was the quietest part of the house, and, besides that, afforded a better view of the heavenly bodies than any other place.</p>
               <p>To this the lady answered that she, too, would like to study astronomy; and asked me if there would be any objection to it.</p>
               <p>"None in the least, madam," returned I; "it would give me vast pleasure to have you for a pupil; but, the fact is, it would quite confuse me to give lessons to two at a time, especially when the<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC5973-00000136"/> scholars were man and wife; wait till your husband has finished his studies, and then I will impart instruction to yourself in this or any other subject I am acquainted with."</p>
               <p>This assurance seemed to satisfy her, and the king and myself went on with our employment without any interruption till the car was finally completed.</p>
               <p>We looked on our handiwork with great complacency, pulling at the cords and framework to test its strength; we then got inside and took our seats on the bench, chatting together very merrily about our voyage, of the provisions it would be necessary to take, and, in short, about all our arrangements.</p>
               <p>"What will the queen think of all this," said the king, "when she hears of my making this tour to the earth without her knowledge or consent?"</p>
               <p>"She'll most probably give you a piece of her mind," answered I; "but, for my part, I think you had best tell her beforehand, and with a little coaxing she will readily give you permission to make the journey."</p>
               <p>"I'll not trust her," said the king, "but will just slip off some fine moonlight night whilst she's fast asleep."</p>
               <p>"Don't be too sure of that," cried a shrill voice, as a closet door suddenly opened, and out popped the queen, who had managed by some means or other to secrete herself in the room. We were much surprised and discomfited at this interruption, and the poor king turned as red as fire. "Yes, Mr. Basket-maker," continued the lady, addressing her husband, "you thought you would play a fine trick on me, and run off on a jaunt without paying me the poor compliment of letting me know of it, though friend Chipo even told you that such was the proper course. But I'll put a stop to such proceedings, and allow no husband of mine to go on such a foolish expedition—only to think of it—what a sight for your subjects to gaze at—a flock of geese flying away with a basket of geese! come, go down stairs and do not stand staring at this gimcrack concern; you have made litter enough with it already for a dozen house-cleanings." So saying, she pushed us out of the room and turned the key in the door.</p>
               <p>I could not help laughing at this strange scene, but the poor king took it quite to heart, and said he feared his trip to the earth was all knocked in the head.</p>
               <p>"By no means," replied I; "do you see after the provisions, and I'll get possession again of the machine; and, wind and weather permitting, we'll be off this very night."</p>
               <p>The king, accordingly, got ready the necessary supplies, which were carefully packed in a basket; and when night arrived, and every one was fast asleep, he met me, by appointment, on the top of the house. I had removed the tiles of the roof and had<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC5973-00000137"/> just got our car fairly out when he arrived, and much was he rejoiced at once more getting possession of it. We lowered it by cords into the street, for fear of making a noise carrying it down stairs; and, having descended ourselves, we put it into a boat and transported it to the island, which we considered the best point to start from; for, as I said before, it was a league from the town and a spot where we were not likely to be interrupted.</p>
               <p>We sat our apparatus on the shore, and went out in the boat to catch the geese; but this, which we expected would be an easy matter, proved very difficult; for, on ordinary occasions when we did not want them, they would flock around us in quite an annoying manner, but now, that we needed them, scarcely one was to be seen. However, we persevered, and after infinite labour and amid such a cackling that almost deafened us, we at last succeeded in capturing about fifty of them, which we brought off in triumph and harnessed to our car. Long cords were attached to the legs of each of them, which cords were secured to the machine; at the bottom of which was a small pan filled with shavings which we intended to set fire to on starting; the heat of which striking on the geese from below would cause them to rise up, and, flying higher and higher to get clear of it, they would of course draw the car after them.</p>
               <p>Every thing being ready and our provisions put aboard, I told the king to jump in, which having done, I immediately followed him and set fire to the shavings. The heat which succeeded produced much fluttering among the geese, who seemed more pleased with it than otherwise, and, raising the car a foot or two from the ground, they hovered round the genial warmth as people in winter-time hover round a fire. We were in this state of suspense, expecting every moment to rise in the air, when a white figure was suddenly seen running down to the beach.</p>
               <p>"By heavens," cried the king, "if there ain't the queen coming!"</p>
               <p>"Impossible," said I, "how could she be out this time of night? no, it's one of those mad people who managed to escape when I locked up the rest of them, and who now comes wrapped in a white sheet thinking to scare us."</p>
               <p>"No, no," answered the king; "it's the queen in her night-gown; I know her too, well to be mistaken; come, let's be off or we'll have another scene."</p>
               <p>But the lady was too quick for us, and had already reached the car and grasped the cords.</p>
               <p>"Oh, you runaways!" cried she; "you thought to steal a march on me, but you see you're not smart enough. You are not, Mr. Chipo, going to run away with my husband. I love him too well and<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC5973-00000138"/> can't afford to part with him; and if he flies off to the earth with you I must go with him."</p>
               <p>"That, my lady," returned I, "is out of the question; the machine is made only to carry two and will barely do even that. Wait till your spouse returns, and then he and you can take a snug little trip all to yourselves."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said the king, "that will be the best way, and we can easily manage it so as to start in a fortnight."</p>
               <p>"I'll wait no fortnight," answered his wife, and so saying she jumped into the car.</p>
               <p>"Then I'll get out and not go at all," returned the king.</p>
               <p>"And I too," said I; and with these words we both leaped on the shore.</p>
               <p>This lightened the machine very much, and the geese now struggled to be off, so that I had great difficulty in holding it down.</p>
               <p>"For heaven's sake, madam," cried I, "get out; the geese are pulling like oxen, and I cannot restrain them much longer."</p>
               <p>"I'll not get out," replied the queen, "you only want to get in yourselves—I've taken my seat and I'll not budge."</p>
               <p>"Then, madam," said I, "I'll have to loose myself from this cord and let the whole concern go adrift, as I cannot hold on to it a moment longer; what say you," continued I, addressing the king; "shall I let her go?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," returned he, "by all means, let her go."</p>
               <p>On hearing this speech, the poor queen burst into tears, asking her husband if he bore no more love to her than that, and if she deserved such treatment at his hands.</p>
               <p>"My dear," said the king, "how can it be wondered at that I lose my temper? you are enough to vex even a saint. Who would have thought of the queen of Moonland streaming down to the lake, at this time of night, in her slippers and night-gown?"</p>
               <p>"And who would have thought," answered the queen, "of the king of Moonland flying off at this time of night with a flock of geese? But do as you please, I'll say no more; go on your voyage, and forget your poor wife: for I see clearly that you think much more of Chipo than you do of me."</p>
               <p>"I should be sorry," interrupted I, "to be the cause of any ill-feeling between your highnesses; and, much as I desire to return home, I will willingly abandon my journey, and remain here forever, if it will be the means of restoring harmony. All that I have said and done was, as I thought, for the best; for it's as clear as daylight that the car cannot carry three persons."</p>
               <p>"You are right," returned the queen; "I see I was too hasty; nor do I wish to throw the least hindrance on your journey: jump in, both of you,<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC5973-00000139"/> then, and be off; only return as soon as possible; and do you, my dear husband, take good care of yourself, and beware of the evils and dangers of the earth, of which I fear there are too many; and keep clear, especially, of the rams, peacemakers, and cannibals." Having thus spoken, she very affectionately kissed us, and bade us farewell; and the king and myself were both so much affected, that tears started in our eyes.</p>
               <p>We now sprang into the car; and, stirring up the fire, the geese were spurred forward, and we rapidly rose in the air. We looked down from our giddy height as the ground gradually receded from us; and the last we saw of the queen, she was still standing on the beach waving her night-cap.</p>
               <p>We continued to mount at a very rapid rate; and the whole surface of the moon, with its towns, lakes, arid mountains, seemed spread at our feet, like burnished silver. Our machine worked admirably; the pan of fire blazed brightly; and, the poor birds vainly attempting to escape from it, we rose in the air almost like a rocket. As we proceeded, the size of the planet we were leaving fast decreased, and the earth, to which we were tending, increased in the same ratio, so that we began gradually to discover the rivers, hills, and, as I also imagined, some of the largest cities. Owing to its great magnitude, the moon began to look small in comparison with it; and it loomed up in the distance in awful dimensions sions, seeming, as it were, to fill up almost the whole sky. The sight set my companion beside himself, so impatient was he to arrive there; and, in order to hurry on our team, he took up an armful of shavings, and threw them on the fire before I could prevent him. The flames rose up a dozen feet, making our car, in a moment, bounce upward a mile at least, and producing a horrid cackling among the geese. I put my hand on my friend's arm, begging him, for heaven's sake, to keep quite, and leave the management of the concern to me.</p>
               <p>"Geese," said I, "have their feelings as well as you and I; and we should not spur them on in this cruel manner."</p>
               <p>"Pooh, pooh!" cried he, "it won't hurt them a bit; but, on the contrary, will do them good, singeing, off some of their useless feathers; I love fast traveling; and, when I do leave home, which is not often, I like not to poke along at a snail pace; besides, I am tired of these biscuits and sandwiches, and want to reach the earth, as soon as possible, if it's only to get a hot supper."</p>
               <p>Just as he spoke, something heavy dropped in my lap; it was a roast goose; for the intense heat was now destroying the poor birds, and they were beginning to drop down dead.</p>
               <p>"Here," said I, lifting it up, "is a hot supper in-deed; your fast traveling and hot suppers will be the death of us."</p>
               <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC5973-00000140"/>
               <p>"What!" cried the king, "are we in any danger? let's put out the fire, or pitch it overboard."</p>
               <p>"It's too late," exclaimed I; "too late; that armful of shavings has finished the business; our birds, I see, are all dead, or dying; our team is dished, and the whole concern gone to pot; take care of yourself, my dear fellow, and try to fall on as soft a spot as you can; for I warrant you'll have fast traveling now."</p>
               <p>Our condition was most pitiable. The geese had fallen down, filling up the car, and dangling at the sides; those that were not yet dead, fluttering and cackling most horribly; the poor king lay on his back, petrified with terror and the picture of despair, grasping the cords of the machine, which was already beginning to capsize. I stood up, for a moment, on the rim of the car, doubting what course I should pursue, whether to fall into the earth or the moon; for we were arrived at that point, when the attraction of the two planets was about evenly balanced, and where but a slight impulse would carry a body in either direction. "Well," said I, "if I must tumble, I might as well tumble into the earth as into the moon, and lay my bones, at least, with those of my progenitors." And so saying, I sprang forward with all my might towards the earth.</p>
               <p>Most rapid was my descent; the sound of a rushing wind whistled in my ears, and darkness soon came over me; then I was aroused by a mighty plunge, and sunk many a fathom deep into the sea. Gradually, I arose from the awful depths, and found myself on the surface in the cheerful light of day. I thanked heaven for so mercifully preserving me, glad to find myself once more in my own planet, and looking upon the very billows heaving around me as old friends.</p>
               <p>To my great joy, I discerned, also, at the distance of some ninety or a hundred miles, the well-known outline of the Andes, their snow-capped peaks rising, as it were, out of the bosom of the sea. I knew, therefore, pretty near where I was, and gazed with intense solicitude upon a sail which I first saw, like a little white spot, on the horizon. To my great joy, I perceived that its course lay in my direction; and after several hours, it was so near that the sailors discovered me, and, having lowered a boat, took me on board. It was a Chilian brig bound to Guayaquil; and greatly was her crew astonished at thus picking me up in the wide Pacific; but what was their astonishment when they learned how I got there, and when they heard the strange adventures that had just happened to me. They treated me most kindly; and, when we reached port, furnished me with money to carry me home, which I reached in a few weeks. I found my friends all well; and when my story was known, people flocked, for miles round, to get a sight of me, and hear me relate my extraordinary journey.</p>
               <pb n="280" xml:id="VAC5973-00000141"/>
               <p>You will all now naturally ask what became of the poor king; but this is a question easier asked than answered. The last I saw of him, he, the geese, the car and the cords, all tangled together and upset, were falling at a fearful rate towards the moon. If they struck on the solid ground, of course, my friend was dashed to pieces; but if he descended upon one of the lakes, of which, as I said before, the country is full, he, probably, was saved; and this I hope and pray was the case.</p>
               <p>Thus did Chipo Capaac relate his marvelous adventures; and by the time he had finished, the night was far spent. His comrades thanked him kindly for the entertainment he had afforded them, and gazed upon him for a while in silent wonder; and all the next day, and for many days after, nothing was talked of but Chipo Capaac and his wonderful journey to the moon.</p>
