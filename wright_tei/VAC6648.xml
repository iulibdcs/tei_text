                  <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
                  <p>IT was nearly two o'clock in the morning. The lights were out in Robinson's
                     Hall, where there had been dancing and revelry; and the moon, riding high,
                     painted the black windows with silver. The cavalcade, that an hour ago had
                     shocked the sedate pines with song and laughter, were all dispersed. One
                     enamoured swain had ridden east, another west, another north, another south;
                     and the object of their adoration, left within her bower at Chemisal Ridge, was
                     calmly going to bed.</p>
                  <p>I regret that I am not able to indicate the exact stage of that process. Two
                     chairs were already filled with delicate inwrappings and white confusion; and
                     the young lady herself, half-hidden in the silky threads of her yellow hair,
                     had at one time borne a faint resemblance to a partly-husked ear of Indian
                     corn. But she was now clothed in that one long, formless garment that makes all
                     women equal; and the round shoulders and neat waist, that an hour<pb n="2-3"
                        xml:id="VAC6648-00000004"/> ago had been so fatal to the peace of mind of
                     Four Forks, had utterly disappeared. The face above it was very pretty: the
                     foot below, albeit shapely, was not small. "The flowers, as a general thing,
                     don't raise their heads <emph>much</emph> to look after me," she had said with
                     superb frankness to one of her lovers.</p>
                  <p>The expression of the "Rose" to-night was contentedly placid. She walked slowly
                     to the window, and, making the smallest possible peephole through the curtain,
                     looked out. The motionless figure of a horseman still lingered on the road,
                     with an excess of devotion that only a coquette, or a woman very much in love,
                     could tolerate. The "Rose," at that moment, was neither, and, after a
                     reasonable pause, turned away, saying quite audibly that it was "too ridiculous
                     for any thing." As she came back to her dressing-table, it was noticeable that
                     she walked steadily and erect, without that slight affectation of lameness
                     common to people with whom bare feet are only an episode. Indeed, it was only
                     four years ago, that without shoes or stockings, a long-limbed, colty girl, in
                     a waistless calico gown, she had leaped from the tailboard of her father's
                     emigrant-wagon when it first drew up at Chemisal Ridge. Certain wild habits of
                     the "Rose" had outlived transplanting and cultivation.</p>
                  <p>A knock at the door surprised her. In another moment she had leaped into bed,
                     and with darkly-frowning eyes, from its secure recesses demanded "Who's
                     there?"</p>
                  <p>An apologetic murmur on the other side of the door was the response.</p>
                  <p>"Why, father!—is that you?"</p>
                  <p>There were further murmurs, affirmative, deprecatory, and persistent.</p>
                  <p>"Wait," said the "Rose." She got up, unlocked the door, leaped nimbly into bed
                     again, and said, "Come."</p>
                  <p>The door opened timidly. The broad, stooping shoulders, and grizzled head, of a
                     man past the middle age, appeared: after a moment's hesitation, a pair of
                     large, diffident feet, shod with canvas slippers, concluded to follow. When the
                     apparition was complete, it closed the door softly, and stood there,—a very shy
                     ghost indeed,—with apparently more than the usual spiritual indisposition to
                     begin a conversation. The "Rose" resented this impatiently, though, I fear, not
                     altogether intelligibly.</p>
                  <p>"Do, father, I declare!"</p>
                  <p>"You was abed, Jinny," said Mr. McClosky slowly, glancing, with a singular
                     mixture of masculine awe and paternal pride, upon the two chairs and their
                     contents,—"you was abed and ondressed."</p>
                  <pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6648-00000005"/>
                  <p>"I was."</p>
                  <p>"Surely," said Mr. McClosky, seating himself on the extreme edge of the bed,
                     and painfully tucking his feet away under it,—"surely." After a pause, he
                     rubbed a short, thick, stumpy beard, that bore a general resemblance to a
                     badly-worn blacking-brush, with the palm of his hand, and went on, "You had a
                     good time, Jinny?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, father."</p>
                  <p>"They was all there?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, Rance and York and Ryder and Jack."</p>
                  <p>"And Jack!" Mr. McClosky endeavored to throw an expression of arch inquiry into
                     his small, tremulous eyes; but meeting the unabashed, widely-opened lid of his
                     daughter, he winked rapidly, and blushed to the roots of his hair.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, Jack was there," said Jenny, without change of color, or the least
                     self-consciousness in her great gray eyes; "and he came home with me." She
                     paused a moment, locking her two hands under her head, and assuming a more
                     comfortable position on the pillow. "He asked me that same question again,
                     father, and I said, 'Yes.' It's to be—soon. We're going to live at Four Forks,
                     in his own house; and next winter we're going to Sacramento. I suppose it's all
                     right, father, eh?" She emphasized the question with a slight kick through the
                     bedclothes, as the parental McClosky had fallen into an abstract revery.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, surely," said Mr. McClosky, recovering himself with some confusion. After
                     a pause, he looked down at the bed-clothes, and, patting them tenderly,
                     continued, "You couldn't have done better, Jinny. They isn't a girl in Tuolumne
                     ez could strike it ez rich as you hev—even if they got the chance." He paused
                     again, and then said, "Jinny?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, father."</p>
                  <p>"You'se in bed, and ondressed?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes."</p>
                  <p>"You couldn't," said Mr. McClosky, glancing hopelessly at the two chairs, and
                     slowly rubbing his chin,—"you couldn't dress yourself again could yer?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, father!"</p>
                  <p>"Kinder get yourself into them things again?" he added hastily. "Not all of
                     'em, you know, but some of 'em. Not if I helped you'—sorter stood by, and lent
                     a hand now and then with a strap, or a buckle, or a necktie, or a shoestring?"
                     he continued, still looking at the chairs, and evidently trying to boldly
                     familiarize himself with their contents.</p>
                  <p>"Are you crazy, father?" demanded Jenny,<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6648-00000006"/>
                     suddenly sitting up with a portentous switch of her yellow mane. Mr. McClosky
                     rubbed one side of his beard, which already had the appearance of having been
                     quite worn away by that process, and faintly dodged the question.</p>
                  <p>"Jinny," he said, tenderly stroking the bedclothes as he spoke, "this yer's
                     what's the matter. Thar is a stranger down stairs,—a stranger to you, lovey,
                     but a man ez I've knowed a long time. He's been here about an hour; and he'll
                     be here ontil fower o'clock, when the up-stage passes. Now I wants ye, Jinny
                     dear, to get up and come down stairs, and kinder help me pass the time with
                     him. It's no use, Jinny," he went on, gently raising his hand to deprecate any
                     interruption, "it's no use! He won't go to bed; he won't play keerds; whiskey
                     don't take no effect on him. Ever since I knowed him, he was the most on
                     satisfactory critter to hev round"—</p>
                  <p>"What do you have him round for, then?" interrupted Miss Jinny sharply.</p>
                  <p>Mr. McClosky's eyes fell. "Ef he hedn't kem out of his way to-night to do me a
                     good turn, I wouldn't ask ye, Jinny. I wouldn't, so help me! But I thought, ez
                     I couldn't do any thing with him, you might come down, and sorter fetch him,
                     Jinny, as you did the others."</p>
                  <p>Miss Jenny shrugged her pretty shoulders.</p>
                  <p>"Is he old, or young?"</p>
                  <p>"He's young enough, Jinny; but he knows a power of things."</p>
                  <p>"What does he do?"</p>
                  <p>"Not much, I reckon. He's got money in the mill at Four Forks. He travels round
                     a good deal. I've heard, Jinny that he's a poet—writes them rhymes, you know."
                     Mr. McClosky here appealed submissively but directly to his daughter. He
                     remembered that she had frequently been in receipt of printed <choice>
                        <sic>elegaic</sic>
                        <corr>elegiac</corr>
                     </choice> couplets known as "mottoes," containing enclosures equally
                     saccharine.</p>
                  <p>Miss Jenny slightly curled her pretty lip She had that fine contempt for the
                     illusions of fancy which belongs to the perfectly healthy young animal.</p>
                  <p>"Not," continued Mr. McClosky, rubbing his head reflectively, "not ez I'd
                     advise ye, Jinny, to say any thing to him about poetry. It ain't twenty minutes
                     ago ez <emph>I</emph> did. I set the whiskey afore him in the parlor. I wound
                     up the music-box, and set it goin'. Then I sez to him, sociable-like and free,
                     'Jest consider yourself in your own house, and repeat what you allow to be your
                     finest production,' and he raged. That man, Jinny, jest raged! Thar's no end of
                     the names he called me. You see, Jinny," continued Mr. McClosky apologetically,
                     "he's known me a long time."</p>
                  <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6648-00000007"/>
                  <p>But his daughter had already dismissed the question with her usual directness.
                     "I'll be down in a few moments, father," she said after a pause, "but don't say
                     any thing to him about it—don't say I was abed."</p>
                  <p>Mr. McClosky's face beamed. "You was allers a good girl, Jinny," he said,
                     dropping on one knee the better to imprint a respectful kiss on her forehead.
                     But Jenny caught him by the wrists, and for a moment held him captive.
                     "Father," said she, trying to fix his shy eyes with the clear, steady glance of
                     her own, "all the girls that were there to-night had some one with them. Mame
                     Robinson had her aunt; Lucy Rance had her mother; Kate Pierson had her
                     sister—all, except me, had some other woman. Father dear," her lip trembled
                     just a little, "I wish mother hadn't died when I was so small. I wish there was
                     some other woman in the family besides me. I ain't lonely with you, father
                     dear; but if there was only some one, you know, when the time comes for John
                     and me"—</p>
                  <p>Her voice here suddenly gave out, but not her brave eyes, that were still fixed
                     earnestly upon his face. Mr. McClosky, apparently tracing out a pattern on the
                     bedquilt, essayed words of comfort.</p>
                  <p>"Thar ain't one of them gals ez you've named, Jinny, ez could do what you've
                     done with a whole Noah's ark of relations at their backs! Thar ain't one ez
                     wouldn't sacrifice her nearest relation to make the strike that you hev. Ez to
                     mothers, maybe, my dear you're doin' better without one." He rose suddenly, and
                     walked toward the door. When he reached it, he turned, and, in his old
                     deprecating manner, said, "Don't be long, Jinny," smiled, and vanished from the
                     head downward, his canvas slippers asserting themselves resolutely to the
                     last.</p>
                  <p>When Mr. McClosky reached his parlor again, his troublesome guest was not
                     there. The decanter stood on the table untouched; three or four books lay upon
                     the floor; a number of photographic views of the Sierras were scattered over
                     the sofa; two sofa-pillows, a newspaper, and a Mexican blanket, lay on the
                     carpet, as if the late occupant of the room had tried to read in a recumbent
                     position. A French window opening upon a veranda, which never before in the
                     history of the house had been unfastened, now betrayed by its waving lace
                     curtain the way that the fugitive had escaped. Mr. McClosky heaved a sigh of
                     despair. He looked at the gorgeous carpet purchased in Sacramento at a fabulous
                     price, at the crimson satin and rosewood furniture unparalleled<pb n="10-11"
                        xml:id="VAC6648-00000008"/> paralleled in the history of Tuolumne, at the
                     massively-framed pictures on the walls, and looked beyond it, through the open
                     window, to the reckless man, who, fleeing these sybaritic allurements, was
                     smoking a cigar upon the moonlit road. This room, which had so often awed the
                     youth of Tuolumne into filial respect, was evidently a failure. It remained to
                     be seen if the "Rose" herself had lost her fragrance. "I reckon Jinny will
                     fetch him yet," said Mr. McClosky with parental faith.</p>
                  <p>He stepped from the window upon the veranda; but he had scarcely done this,
                     before his figure was detected by the stranger, who at once crossed the road.
                     When within a few feet of McClosky, he stopped. "You persistent old
                     plantigrade!" he said in a low voice, audible only to the person addressed, and
                     a face full of affected anxiety, "why don't you go to bed? Didn't I tell you to
                     go and leave me here alone? In the name of all that's idiotic and imbecile, why
                     do you continue to shuffle about here? Or are you trying to drive me crazy with
                     your presence, as you have with that wretched music-box that I've just dropped
                     under yonder tree? It's an hour and a half yet before the stage passes: do you
                     think, do you imagine for a single moment, that I can tolerate you until then,
                     eh? Why don't you speak? Are you asleep? You don't mean to say that you have
                     the audacity to add somnambulism to your other weaknesses? you're not low
                     enough to repeat yourself under any such weak pretext as that, eh?"</p>
                  <p>A fit of nervous coughing ended this extraordinary exordium; and half sitting,
                     half leaning against the veranda, Mr. McClosky's guest turned his face, and
                     part of a slight elegant figure, toward his host. The lower portion of this
                     upturned face wore an habitual expression of fastidious discontent, with an
                     occasional line of physical suffering. But the brow above was frank and
                     critical; and a pair of dark, mirthful eyes, sat in playful judgment over the
                     supersensitive mouth and its suggestion.</p>
                  <p>"I allowed to go to bed, Ridgeway," said Mr. McClosky meekly; "but my girl
                     Jinny's jist got back from a little tear up at Robinson's, and ain't inclined
                     to turn in yet. You know what girls is. So I thought we three would jist have a
                     social chat together to pass away the time."</p>
                  <p>"You mendacious old hypocrite! She got back an hour ago," said Ridgeway, "as
                     that savage-looking escort of hers, who has been haunting the house ever since,
                     can testify. My belief is, that, like an enterprising idiot as you are, you've
                     dragged that girl out of her bed, that we might mutually bore each other."</p>
                  <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6648-00000009"/>
                  <p>Mr. McClosky was too much stunned by this evidence of Ridgeway's apparently
                     superhuman penetration to reply. After enjoying his host's confusion for a
                     moment with his eyes, Ridgeway's mouth asked grimly,—</p>
                  <p>"And who is this girl, anyway?"</p>
                  <p>"Nancy's."</p>
                  <p>"Your wife's?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes. But look yar, Ridgeway," said McClosky, laying one hand imploringly on
                     Ridgeway's sleeve, "not a word about her to Jinny. She thinks her mother's
                     dead—died in Missouri. Eh!"</p>
                  <p>Ridgeway nearly rolled from the veranda in an excess of rage. "Good God! Do you
                     mean to say that you have been concealing from her a fact that any day, any
                     moment, may come to her ears? That you've been letting her grow up in ignorance
                     of something that by this time she might have outgrown and forgotten? That you
                     have been, like a besotted old ass, all these years slowly forging a
                     thunderbolt that any one may crush her with? That"—but here Ridgeway's cough
                     took possession of his voice, and even put a moisture into his dark eyes, as he
                     looked at McClosky's aimless hand feebly employed upon his beard.</p>
                  <p>"But," said McClosky, "look how she's done! She's held her head as high as any
                     of 'em. She's to be married in a month to the richest man in the county; and,"
                     he added cunningly," Jack Ashe ain't the kind o' man to sit by and hear any
                     thing said of his wife or her relations, you bet! But hush—that's her foot on
                     the stairs. She's cummin'."</p>
                  <p>She came. I don't think the French window ever held a finer view than when she
                     put aside the curtains, and stepped out. She had dressed herself simply and
                     hurriedly, but with a woman's knowledge of her best points; so that you got the
                     long curves of her shapely limbs, the shorter curves of her round waist and
                     shoulders, the long sweep of her yellow braids, the light of her gray eyes, and
                     even the delicate rose of her complexion, without knowing how it was delivered
                     to you.</p>
                  <p>The introduction by Mr. McClosky was brief. When Ridgeway had got over the fact
                     that it was two o'clock in the morning, and that the cheek of this Tuolumne
                     goddess nearest him was as dewy and fresh as an infant's, that she looked like
                     Marguerite, without, probably, ever having heard of Gœthe's heroine, he talked,
                     I dare say, very sensibly. When Miss Jenny—who from her childhood had been
                     brought up among the sons of Anak, and who was accustomed to have the supremacy
                     of our noble sex presented to her as a physical fact—found herself<pb n="14-15"
                        xml:id="VAC6648-00000010"/> self in the presence of a new and strange power
                     in the slight and elegant figure beside her, she was at first frightened and
                     cold. But finding that this power, against which the weapons of her own
                     physical charms were of no avail, was a kindly one, albeit general, she fell to
                     worshipping it, after the fashion of woman, and casting before it the fetishes
                     and other idols of her youth. She even confessed to it. So that, in half an
                     hour, Ridgeway was in possession of all the facts connected with her life, and
                     a great many, I fear, of her fancies—except one. When Mr. McClosky found the
                     young people thus amicably disposed, he calmly went to sleep.</p>
                  <p>It was a pleasant time to each. To Miss Jenny it had the charm of novelty; and
                     she abandoned herself to it, for that reason, much more freely and innocently
                     than her companion, who knew something more of the inevitable logic of the
                     position. I do not think, however, he had any intention of love-making. I do
                     not think he was at all conscious of being in the attitude. I am quite positive
                     he would have shrunk from the suggestion of disloyalty to the one woman whom he
                     admitted to himself he loved. But, like most poets, he was much more true to an
                     idea than a fact, and having a very lofty conception of womanhood, with a very
                     sanguine nature, he saw in each new face the possibilities of a realization of
                     his ideal. It was, perhaps, an unfortunate thing for the women, particularly as
                     he brought to each trial a surprising freshness, which was very deceptive, and
                     quite distinct from the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">blasé</foreign> familiarity of
                     the man of gallantry. It was this perennial virginity of the affections that
                     most endeared him to the best women, who were prone to exercise toward him a
                     chivalrous protection,—as of one likely to go astray, unless looked after,—and
                     indulged in the dangerous combination of sentiment with the highest maternal
                     instincts. It was this quality which caused Jenny to recognize in him a certain
                     boyishness that required her womanly care, and even induced her to offer to
                     accompany him to the cross-roads when the time for his departure arrived. With
                     her superior knowledge of woodcraft and the locality, she would have kept him
                     from being lost. I wot not but that she would have protected him from bears or
                     wolves, but chiefly, I think, from the feline fascinations of Mame Robinson and
                     Lucy Rance, who might be lying in wait for this tender young poet. Nor did she
                     cease to be thankful that Providence had, so to speak, delivered him as a trust
                     into her hands.</p>
                  <p>It was a lovely night. The moon swung low, and languished softly on the snowy
                        ridge<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6648-00000011"/> beyond. There were quaint
                     odors in the still air; and a strange incense from the woods perfumed their
                     young blood, and seemed to swoon in their pulses. Small wonder that they
                     lingered on the white road, that their feet climbed, unwillingly the little
                     hill where they were to part, and that, when they at last reached it, even the
                     saving grace of speech seemed to have forsaken them.</p>
                  <p>For there they stood alone. There was no sound nor motion in earth, or woods,
                     or heaven. They might have been the one man and woman for whom this goodly
                     earth that lay at their feet, rimmed with the deepest azure, was created. And,
                     seeing this, they turned toward each other with a sudden instinct, and their
                     hands met, and then their lips in one long kiss.</p>
                  <p>And then out of the mysterious distance came the sound of voices, and the sharp
                     clatter of hoofs and wheels, and Jenny slid away—a white moonbeam—from the
                     hill. For a moment she glimmered through the trees, and then, reaching the
                     house, passed her sleeping father on the veranda, and, darting into her
                     bedroom, locked the door, threw open the window, and, falling on her knees
                     beside it, leaned her hot cheeks upon her hands, and listened. In a few moments
                     she was rewarded by the sharp clatter of hoofs on the stony road; but it was
                     only a horseman, whose dark figure was swiftly lost in the shadows of the lower
                     road. At another time she might have recognized the man; but her eyes and ears
                     were now all intent on something else. It came presently with dancing lights, a
                     musical rattle of harness, a cadence of hoof-beats, that set her heart to
                     beating in unison—and was gone. A sudden sense of loneliness came over her; and
                     tears gathered in her sweet eyes.</p>
                  <p>She arose, and looked around her. There was the little bed, the dressing-table,
                     the roses that she had worn last night, still fresh and blooming in the little
                     vase. Every thing was there; but every thing looked strange. The roses should
                     have been withered, for the party seemed so long ago. She could hardly remember
                     when she had worn this dress that lay upon the chair. So she came back to the
                     window, and sank down beside it, with her cheek a trifle paler, leaning on her
                     hand, and her long braids reaching to the floor. The stars paled slowly, like
                     her cheek; yet with eyes that saw not, she still looked from her window for the
                     coming dawn.</p>
                  <p>It came, with violet deepening into purple, with purple flushing into rose,
                     with rose shining into silver, and glowing into gold. The straggling line of
                     black picket-fence below, that had faded away with the stars, came back with
                        the<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6648-00000012"/> sun. What was that object
                     moving by the fence? Jenny raised her head, and looked intently. It was a man
                     endeavoring to climb the pickets, and falling backward with each attempt.
                     Suddenly she started to her feet, as if the rosy flushes of the dawn had
                     crimsoned her from forehead to shoulders; then she stood, white as the wall,
                     with her hands clasped upon her bosom; then, with a single bound, she reached
                     the door, and, with flying braids and fluttering skirt, sprang down the stairs,
                     and out to the garden walk. When within a few feet of the fence, she uttered a
                     cry, the first she had given,—the cry of a mother over her stricken babe, of a
                     tigress over her mangled cub; and in another moment she had leaped the fence,
                     and knelt beside Ridgeway, with his fainting head upon her breast.</p>
                  <p>"My boy, my poor, poor boy! who has done this?"</p>
                  <p>Who, indeed? His clothes were covered with dust; his waistcoat was torn open;
                     and his handkerchief, wet with the blood it could not stanch, fell from a cruel
                     stab beneath his shoulder.</p>
                  <p>"Ridgeway, my poor boy! tell me what has happened."</p>
                  <p>Ridgeway slowly opened his heavy blue-veined lids, and gazed upon her.
                     Presently a gleam of mischief came into his dark eyes, a smile stole over his
                     lips as he whispered slowly,—</p>
                  <p>"It—was—your kiss—did it, Jenny dear! I had forgotten—how high-priced the
                     article was here. Never mind, Jenny!"—he feebly raised her hand to his white
                     lips,—"it was—worth it," and fainted away.</p>
                  <p>Jenny started to her feet, and looked wildly around her. Then, with a sudden
                     resolution, she stooped over the insensible man, and with one strong effort
                     lifted him in her arms as if he had been a child. When her father, a moment
                     later, rubbed his eyes, and awoke from his sleep upon the veranda, it was to
                     see a goddess, erect and triumphant, striding toward the house with the
                     helpless body of a man lying across that breast where man had never lain
                     before,—a goddess, at whose imperious mandate he arose, and cast open the doors
                     before her. And then, when she had laid her unconscious burden on the sofa, the
                     goddess fled; and a woman, helpless and trembling, stood before him,—a woman
                     that cried out that she had "killed him," that she was "wicked, wicked!" and
                     that, even saying so, staggered, and fell beside her late burden. And all that
                     Mr. McClosky could do was to feebly rub his beard, and say to himself vaguely
                     and incoherently, that "Jinny had fetched him."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                  <p>BEFORE noon the next day, it was generally believed throughout Four Forks that
                     Ridgeway Dent had been attacked and wounded at Chemisal Ridge by a highwayman,
                     who fled on the approach of the Wingdam coach. It is to be presumed that this
                     statement met with Ridgeway's approval, as he did not contradict it, nor
                     supplement it with any details. His wound was severe, but not dangerous. After
                     the first excitement had subsided, there was, I think, a prevailing impression
                     common to the provincial mind, that his misfortune was the result of the
                     defective moral quality of his being a stranger, and was, in a vague sort of a
                     way, a warning to others, and a lesson to him. "Did you hear how that
                     San-Francisco feller was took down the other night?" was the average tone of
                     introductory remark. Indeed, there was a general suggestion that Ridgeway's
                     presence was one that no self-respecting, high-minded highwayman, honorably
                     conservative of the best interests of Tuolumne County, could for a moment
                     tolerate.</p>
                  <p>Except for the few words spoken on that eventful morning, Ridgeway was reticent
                     of the past. When Jenny strove to gather some details of the affray that might
                     offer a clew to his unknown assailant, a subtle twinkle in his brown eyes was
                     the only response. When Mr. McClosky attempted the same process, the young
                     gentleman threw abusive epithets, and, eventually slippers, teaspoons, and
                     other lighter articles within the reach of an invalid, at the head of his
                     questioner. "I think he's coming round, Jinny," said Mr. McClosky: "he laid for
                     me this morning with a candlestick."</p>
                  <p>It was about this time that Miss Jenny, having sworn her father to secrecy
                     regarding the manner in which Ridgeway had been carried into the house,
                     conceived the idea of addressing the young man as "Mr. Dent," and of
                     apologizing for intruding whenever she entered the room in the discharge of her
                     household duties. It was about this time that she became more rigidly
                     conscientious to those duties, and less general in her attentions. It was at
                     this time that the quality of the invalid's diet improved, and that she
                     consulted him less frequently about it. It was about this time that she began
                     to see more company, that the house was greatly frequented by her former
                     admirers, with whom she rode, walked, and danced. It was at about this time
                     also, and when Ridgeway was able to be brought out on the veranda in a chair,
                     that, with great archness<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6648-00000014"/> of manner,
                     she introduced to him Miss Lucy Ashe, the sister of her betrothed, a flashing
                     brunette, and terrible heart-breaker of Four Forks. And, in the midst of this
                     gayety, she concluded that she would spend a week with the Robinsons, to whom
                     she owed a visit. She enjoyed herself greatly there, so much, indeed, that she
                     became quite hollow-eyed, the result, as she explained to her father, of a too
                     frequent indulgence in festivity. "You see, father, I won't have many chances
                     after John and I are married: you know how queer he is, and I must make the
                     most of my time;" and she laughed an odd little laugh, which had lately become
                     habitual to her. "And how is Mr. Dent getting on?" Her father replied that he
                     was getting on very well indeed,—so well, in fact, that he was able to leave
                     for San Francisco two days ago. "He wanted to be remembered to you,
                     Jinny,—'remembered kindly,'—yes, they is the very words he used," said
                     Mr.McClosky, looking down, and consulting one of his large shoes for
                     corroboration. Miss Jenny was glad to hear that he was so much better. Miss
                     Jenny could not imagine any thing that pleased her more than to know that he
                     was so strong as to be able to rejoin his friends again, who must love him so
                     much, and be so anxious about him. Her father thought she would be pleased,
                     and, now that he was gone, there was really no necessity for her to hurry back.
                     Miss Jenny, in a high metallic voice, did not know that she had expressed any
                     desire to stay, still if her presence had become distasteful at home, if her
                     own father was desirous of getting rid of her, if, when she was so soon to
                     leave his roof forever, he still begrudged her those few days remaining, if—"My
                     God, Jinny, so help me!" said Mr.McClosky, clutching despairingly at his beard,
                     "I didn't go for to say any thing of the kind. I thought that you"—"Never mind,
                     father," interrupted Jenny magnanimously, "you misunderstood me: of course you
                     did, you couldn't help it—you're a MAN!" Mr. McClosky, sorely crushed, would
                     have vaguely protested; but his daughter, having relieved herself, after the
                     manner of her sex, with a mental personal application of an abstract statement,
                     forgave him with a kiss.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless, for two or three days after her return, Mr. McClosky followed his
                     daughter about the house with yearning eyes, and occasionally with timid,
                     diffident feet. Sometimes he came upon her suddenly at her household tasks,
                     with an excuse so palpably false, and a careless manner so outrageously
                     studied, that she was fain to be embarrassed for him. Later, he took to
                     rambling about the house at night,<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6648-00000015"/> and
                     was often seen noiselessly passing and repassing through the hall after she had
                     retired. On one occasion, he was surprised, first by sleep, and then by the
                     early-rising Jenny, as he lay on the rug outside her chamber-door. "You treat
                     me like a child, father," said Jenny. "I thought, Jinny," said the father
                     apologetically,—"I thought I heard sounds as if you was takin' on inside, and,
                     listenin' I fell asleep."—"You dear, old simple-minded baby!" said Jenny,
                     looking past her father's eyes, and lifting his grizzled locks one by one with
                     meditative fingers: "what should I be takin' on for? Look how much taller I am
                     than you!" she said, suddenly lifting herself up to the extreme of her superb
                     figure. Then rubbing his head rapidly with both hands, as if she were anointing
                     his hair with some rare unguent, she patted him on the back, and returned to
                     her room. The result of this and one or two other equally sympathetic
                     interviews was to produce a change in Mr. McClosky's manner, which was, if
                     possible, still more discomposing. He grew unjustifiably hilarious, cracked
                     jokes with the servants, and repeated to Jenny humorous stories, with the
                     attitude of facetiousness carefully preserved throughout the entire narration,
                     and the point utterly ignored and forgotten. Certain incidents reminded him of
                     funny things, which invariably turned out to have not the slightest relevancy
                     or application. He occasionally brought home with him practical humorists, with
                     a sanguine hope of setting them going, like the music-box, for his daughter's
                     edification. He essayed the singing of melodies with great freedom of style,
                     and singular limitation of note. He sang "Come haste to the Wedding, Ye Lasses
                     and Maidens," of which he knew a single line, and that incorrectly, as being
                     peculiarly apt and appropriate. Yet away from the house and his daughter's
                     presence, he was silent and distraught. His absence of mind was particularly
                     noted by his workmen at the Empire Quartz Mill. "Ef the old man don't look out
                     and wake up," said his foreman, "he'll hev them feet of his yet under the
                     stamps. When he ain't givin' his mind to 'em, they is altogether too
                     promiskuss."</p>
                  <p>A few nights later, Miss Jenny recognized her father's hand in a timid tap at
                     the door. She opened it, and he stood before her, with a valise in his hand,
                     equipped as for a journey. "I takes the stage to-night, Jinny dear, from Four
                     Forks to 'Frisco. Maybe I may drop in on Jack afore I go. I'll be back in a
                     week. Good-by."</p>
                  <p>"Good-by." He still held her hand. Presently he drew her back into the room,
                        closing<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6648-00000016"/> the door carefully, and
                     glancing around. There was a look of profound cunning in his eye as he said
                     slowly,—</p>
                  <p>"Bear up, and keep dark, Jinny dear, and trust to the old man. Various men has
                     various ways. Thar is ways as is common, and ways as is uncommon; ways as is
                     easy, and ways as is oneasy. Bear up, and keep dark." With this Delphic
                     utterance he put his finger to his lips, and vanished.</p>
                  <p>It was ten o'clock when he reached Four Forks. A few minutes later, he stood on
                     the threshold of that dwelling described by the Four Forks "Sentinel" as "the
                     palatial residence of John Ashe," and known to the local satirist as the
                     "ash-box." "Hevin' to lay by two hours, John," he said to his prospective
                     son-in-law, as he took his hand at the door, "a few words of social converse,
                     not on business, but strictly private, seems to be about as nat'ral a thing as
                     a man can do." This introduction, evidently the result of some study, and
                     plainly committed to memory, seemed so satisfactory to Mr. McClosky, that he
                     repeated it again, after John Ashe had led him into his private office, where,
                     depositing his valise in the middle of the floor, and sitting down before it,
                     he began carefully to avoid the eye of his host. John Ashe, a tall, dark,
                     handsome Kentuckian tuckian, with whom even the trifles of life were evidently
                     full of serious import, waited with a kind of chivalrous respect the further
                     speech of his guest. Being utterly devoid of any sense of the ridiculous, he
                     always accepted Mr. McClosky as a grave fact, singular only from his own want
                     of experience of the class.</p>
                  <p>"Ores is running light now," said Mr. McClosky with easy indifference.</p>
                  <p>John Ashe returned that he had noticed the same fact in the receipts of the
                     mill at Four Forks.</p>
                  <p>Mr. McClosky rubbed his beard, and looked at his valise, as if for sympathy and
                     suggestion.</p>
                  <p>"You don't reckon on having any trouble with any of them chaps as you cut out
                     with Jinny?"</p>
                  <p>John Ashe, rather haughtily, had never thought of that. "I saw Rance hanging
                     round your house the other night, when I took your daughter home; but he gave
                     me a wide berth," he added carelessly.</p>
                  <p>"Surely," said Mr. McClosky, with a peculiar winking of the eye. After a pause,
                     he took a fresh departure from his valise.</p>
                  <p>"A few words, John, ez between man and man, ez between my daughter's father and
                     her husband who expects to be, is about the thing,<pb n="28-29"
                        xml:id="VAC6648-00000017"/> I take it, as is fair and square. I kem here to
                     say them. They're about Jinny, my gal."</p>
                  <p>Ashe's grave face brightened, to Mr. McClosky's evident discomposure.</p>
                  <p>"Maybe I should have said about her mother; but, the same bein' a stranger to
                     you, I says naterally, 'Jinny.'"</p>
                  <p>Ashe nodded courteously. Mr. McClosky, with his eyes on his valise, went
                     on,—</p>
                  <p>"It is sixteen year ago as I married Mrs. McClosky in the State of Missouri.
                     She let on, at the time, to be a widder,—a widder with one child. When I say
                     let on, I mean to imply that I subsekently found out that she was not a widder,
                     nor a wife; and the father of the child was, so to speak, onbeknowst. Thet
                     child was Jinny—my gal."</p>
                  <p>With his eyes on his valise, and quietly ignoring the wholly-crimsoned face and
                     swiftly-darkening brow of his host, he continued,—</p>
                  <p>"Many little things sorter tended to make our home in Missouri onpleasant. A
                     disposition to smash furniture, and heave knives around; an inclination to howl
                     when drunk, and that frequent; a habitooal use of vulgar language, and a
                     tendency to cuss the casooal visitor,—seemed to pint," added Mr. McClosky with
                     submissive hesitation "that—she—was—so to speak—quite onsuited to the marriage
                     relation in its holiest aspeck."</p>
                  <p>"Damnation! Why didn't"—burst out John Ashe, erect and furious.</p>
                  <p>"At the end of two year," continued Mr. McClosky, still intent on the valise,
                     "I allowed I'd get a diworce. Et about thet time, however, Providence sends a
                     circus into thet town, and a feller ez rode three horses to onct. Hevin' allez
                     a taste for athletic sports, she left town with this feller, leavin' me and
                     Jinny behind. I sent word to her, thet, if she would give Jinny to me, we'd
                     call it quits. And she did."</p>
                  <p>"Tell me," gasped Ashe, "did you ask your daughter to keep this from me? or did
                     she do it of her own accord?"</p>
                  <p>"She doesn't know it," said Mr. McClosky. "She thinks I'm her father, and that
                     her mother's dead."</p>
                  <p>"Then, sir, this is your"—</p>
                  <p>"I don't know," said Mr. McClosky slowly, "ez I've asked any one to marry my
                     Jinny. I don't know ez I've persood that ez a biziness, or even taken it up as
                     a healthful recreation."</p>
                  <p>John Ashe paced the room furiously. Mr. McClosky's eyes left the valise, and
                     followed him curiously. "Where is this woman?" demanded Ashe suddenly.
                     McClosky's eyes sought the valise again.</p>
                  <p>"She went to Kansas; from Kansas she went into Texas; from Texas she
                     eventooally came<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6648-00000018"/> to Californy. Being
                     here, I've purvided her with money, when her business was slack, through a
                     friend."</p>
                  <p>John Ashe groaned. "She's gettin' rather old and shaky for hosses, and now does
                     the tight-rope business and flying trapeze. Never hevin' seen her perform,"
                     continued Mr. McClosky with conscientious caution, "I can't say how she gets
                     on. On the bills she looks well. Thar is a poster," said Mr. McClosky glancing
                     at Ashe, and opening his valise,—"thar is a poster givin' her performance at
                     Marysville next month." Mr. McClosky slowly unfolded a large yellow-and-blue
                     printed poster, profusely illustrated. "She calls herself 'Mams'elle J.
                     Miglawski, the great Russian Trapeziste.'"</p>
                  <p>John Ashe tore it from his hand. "Of course," he said, suddenly facing Mr.
                     McClosky, "you don't expect me to go on with this?"</p>
                  <p>Mr. McClosky took up the poster, carefully refolded it, and returned it to his
                     valise. "When you break off with Jinny," he said quietly, "I don't want any
                     thing said 'bout this. She doesn't know it. She's a woman, and I reckon you're
                     a white man."</p>
                  <p>"But what am I to say? How am I to go back of my word?"</p>
                  <p>"Write her a note. Say something hez come to your knowledge (don't say what)
                     that makes you break it off. You needn't be afeard Jinny'll ever ask you
                     what."</p>
                  <p>John Ashe hesitated. He felt he had been cruelly wronged. No gentleman, no
                     Ashe, could go on further in this affair. It was preposterous to think of it.
                     But somehow he felt at the moment very unlike a gentleman, or an Ashe, and was
                     quite sure he should break down under Jenny's steady eyes. But then—he could
                     write to her.</p>
                  <p>"So ores is about as light here as on the Ridge. Well, I reckon they'll come up
                     before the rains. Good-night." Mr. McClosky took the hand that his host
                     mechanically extended, shook it gravely, and was gone.</p>
                  <p>When Mr. McClosky, a week later, stepped again upon his own veranda, he saw
                     through the French window the figure of a man in his parlor. Under his
                     hospitable roof, the sight was not unusual; but, for an instant, a subtle sense
                     of disappointment thrilled him. When he saw it was not the face of Ashe turned
                     toward him, he was relieved; but when he saw the tawny beard, and quick,
                     passionate eyes of Henry Rance, he felt a new sense of apprehension, so that he
                     fell to rubbing his beard almost upon his very threshold.</p>
                  <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6648-00000019"/>
                  <p>Jenny ran into the hall, and seized her father with a little cry of joy.
                     "Father," said Jenny in a hurried whisper, "don't mind <emph>him</emph>,"
                     indicating Rance with a toss of her yellow braids: "he's going soon. And I
                     think, father, I've done him wrong. But it's all over with John and me now.
                     Read that note, and see how he's insulted me." Her lip quivered; but she went
                     on, "It's Ridgeway that he means, father; and I believe it was <emph>his</emph>
                     hand struck Ridgeway down, or that he knows who did. But hush now! not a
                     word."</p>
                  <p>She gave him a feverish kiss, and glided back into the parlor, leaving Mr.
                     McClosky, perplexed and irresolute, with the note in his hand. He glanced at it
                     hurriedly, and saw that it was couched in almost the very words he had
                     suggested. But a sudden, apprehensive recollection came over him. He listened;
                     and, with an exclamation of dismay, he seized his hat, and ran out of the
                     house, but too late. At the same moment a quick, nervous footstep was heard
                     upon the veranda; the French window flew open, and, with a light laugh of
                     greeting, Ridgeway stepped into the room.</p>
                  <p>Jenny's finer ear first caught the step. Jenny's swifter feelings had sounded
                     the depths of hope, of joy, of despair, before he entered the room. Jenny's
                     pale face was the only one that met his, self-possessed and self-reliant, when
                     he stood before them. An angry flush suffused even the pink roots of Rance's
                     beard as he rose to his feet. An ominous fire sprang into Ridgeway's eyes, and
                     a spasm of hate and scorn passed over the lower part of his face, and left the
                     mouth and jaw immobile and rigid.</p>
                  <p>Yet he was the first to speak. "I owe you an apology," he said to Jenny, with a
                     suave scorn that brought the indignant blood back to her cheek, "for this
                     intrusion; but I ask no pardon for withdrawing from the only spot where that
                     man dare confront me with safety."</p>
                  <p>With an exclamation of rage, Rance sprang toward him. But as quickly Jenny
                     stood between them, erect and menacing. "There must be no quarrel here," she
                     said to Rance. "While I protect your right as my guest, don't oblige me to
                     remind you of mine as your hostess." She turned with a half-deprecatory air to
                     Ridgeway; but he was gone. So was her father. Only Rance remained with a look
                     of ill-concealed triumph on his face.</p>
                  <p>Without looking at him, she passed toward the door. When she reached it, she
                     turned. "You asked me a question an hour ago. Come to me in the garden, at nine
                     o'clock to-night, and I will answer you. But promise me, first, to keep away
                     from Mr. Dent. Give me your<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6648-00000020"/> word not
                     to seek him—to avoid him, if he seeks you. Do you promise? It is well."</p>
                  <p>He would have taken her hand; but she waved him away. In another moment he
                     heard the swift rustle of her dress in the hall, the sound of her feet upon the
                     stair, the sharp closing of her bedroom door, and all was quiet.</p>
                  <p>And even thus quietly the day wore away; and the night rose slowly from the
                     valley, and overshadowed the mountains with purple wings that fanned the still
                     air into a breeze, until the moon followed it, and lulled every thing to rest
                     as with the laying-on of white and benedictory hands. It was a lovely night;
                     but Henry Rance, waiting impatiently beneath a sycamore at the foot of the
                     garden, saw no beauty in earth or air or sky. A thousand suspicions common to a
                     jealous nature, a vague superstition of the spot, filled his mind with distrust
                     and doubt. "If this should be a trick to keep my hands off that insolent pup!"
                     he muttered. But, even as the thought passed his tongue, a white figure slid
                     from the shrubbery near the house, glided along the line of picket-fence, and
                     then stopped, midway, motionless in the moonlight.</p>
                  <p>It was she. But he scarcely recognized her in the white drapery that covered
                     her head and shoulders and breast. He approached her with a hurried whisper.
                     "Let us withdraw from the moonlight. Everybody can see us here."</p>
                  <p>"We have nothing to say that cannot be said in the moonlight, Henry Rance," she
                     replied, coldly receding from his proffered hand. She trembled for a moment, as
                     if with a chill, and then suddenly turned upon him. "Hold up your head, and let
                     me look at you! I've known only what men are: let me see what a traitor looks
                     like!"</p>
                  <p>He recoiled more from her wild face than her words. He saw from the first that
                     her hollow cheeks and hollow eyes were blazing with fever. He was no coward;
                     but he would have fled.</p>
                  <p>"You are ill, Jenny," he said: "you had best return to the house. Another
                     time"—</p>
                  <p>"Stop!" she cried hoarsely. "Move from this spot, and I'll call for help!
                     Attempt to leave me now, and I'll proclaim you the assassin that you are!"</p>
                  <p>"It was a fair fight," he said doggedly.</p>
                  <p>"Was it a fair fight to creep behind an unarmed and unsuspecting man? Was it a
                     fair fight to try to throw suspicion on some one else? Was it a fair fight to
                     deceive me? Liar and coward that you are!"</p>
                  <p>He made a stealthy step toward her with evil eyes, and a wickeder hand that
                     crept within his breast. She saw the motion; but it only stung her to newer
                     fury.</p>
                  <p>"Strike!" she said with blazing eyes, throwing<pb n="36-37"
                        xml:id="VAC6648-00000021"/> ing her hands open before him. "Strike! Are you
                     afraid of the woman who dares you? Or do you keep your knife for the backs of
                     unsuspecting men? Strike, I tell you! No? Look, then!" With a sudden movement,
                     she tore from her head and shoulders the thick lace shawl that had concealed
                     her figure, and stood before him. "Look!" she cried passionately, pointing to
                     the bosom and shoulders of her white dress, darkly streaked with faded stains
                     and ominous discoloration,—"look! This is the dress I wore that morning when I
                     found him lying here,—<emph>here</emph>,—bleeding from your cowardly knife.
                     Look! Do you see? This is his blood,—my darling boy's blood!—one drop of which,
                     dead and faded as it is, is more precious to me than the whole living pulse of
                     any other man. Look! I come to you to-night, christened with his blood, and
                     dare you to strike,—dare you to strike him again through me, and mingle my
                     blood with his. Strike, I implore you! Strike! if you have any pity on me, for
                     God's sake! Strike! if you are a man! Look! Here lay his head on my shoulder;
                     here I held him to my breast, where never—so help me my God!—another
                     man—Ah!"—</p>
                  <p>She reeled against the fence, and something that had flashed in Rance's hand
                     dropped at her feet; for another flash and report rolled him over in the dust:
                     and across his writhing body two men strode, and caught her ere she fell.</p>
                  <p>"She has only fainted," said Mr. McClosky. "Jinny dear, my girl, speak to
                     me!"</p>
                  <p>"What is this on her dress?" said Ridgeway, kneeling beside her, and lifting
                     his set and colorless face. At the sound of his voice, the color came faintly
                     back to her cheek: she opened her eyes, and smiled.</p>
                  <p>"It's only your blood, dear boy," she said; "but look a little deeper, and
                     you'll find my own."</p>
                  <p>She put up her two yearning hands, and drew his face and lips down to her own.
                     When Ridgeway raised his head again, her eyes were closed; but her mouth still
                     smiled as with the memory of a kiss.</p>
                  <p>They bore her to the house, still breathing, but unconscious. That night the
                     road was filled with clattering horsemen; and the summoned skill of the
                     countryside for leagues away gathered at her couch. The wound, they said, was
                     not essentially dangerous; but they had grave fears of the shock to a system
                     that already seemed suffering from some strange and unaccountable nervous
                     exhaustion. The best medical skill of Tuolumne happened to be young and
                     observing, and waited patiently an opportunity to account for it. He was
                     presently rewarded.</p>
                  <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6648-00000022"/>
                  <p>For toward morning she rallied, and looked feebly around. Then she beckoned her
                     father toward her, and whispered, "Where is he?"</p>
                  <p>"They took him away, Jinny dear, in a cart. He won't trouble you agin." He
                     stopped; for Miss Jenny had raised herself on her elbow, and was levelling her
                     black brows at him. But two kicks from the young surgeon, and a significant
                     motion towards the door, sent Mr. McClosky away muttering. "How should I know
                     that '<emph>he</emph>' meant Ridgeway?" he said apologetically, as he went and
                     returned with the young gentleman. The surgeon, who was still holding her
                     pulse, smiled, and thought that—with a little care—and attention—the
                     stimulants—might be—diminished—and—he—might leave—the patient for some hours
                     with perfect safety. He would give further directions to Mr. McClosky—down
                     stairs.</p>
                  <p>It was with great archness of manner, that, half an hour later, Mr. McClosky
                     entered the room with a preparatory cough; and it was with some disappointment
                     that he found Ridgeway standing quietly by the window, and his daughter
                     apparently fallen into a light doze. He was still more concerned, when, after
                     Ridgeway had retired, noticing a pleasant smile playing about her lips, he said
                     softly—</p>
                  <p>"You was thinking of some one, Jinny?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, father," the gray eyes met his steadily,—"of poor John Ashe!"</p>
                  <p>Her recovery was swift. Nature, that had seemed to stand jealously aloof from
                     her in her mental anguish, was kind to the physical hurt of her favorite child.
                     The <choice>
                        <sic>suberb</sic>
                        <corr>superb</corr>
                     </choice> physique, which had been her charm and her trial, now stood her in
                     good stead. The healing balsam of the pine, the balm of resinous gums, and the
                     rare medicaments of Sierran altitudes, touched her as it might have touched the
                     wounded doe; so that in two weeks she was able to walk about. And when, at the
                     end of the month, Ridgeway returned from a flying visit to San Francisco, and
                     jumped from the Wingdam coach at four o'clock in the morning, the Rose of
                     Tuolumne, with the dewy petals of either cheek fresh as when first unfolded to
                     his kiss, confronted him on the road.</p>
                  <p>With a common instinct, their young feet both climbed the little hill now
                     sacred to their thought. When they reached its summit, they were both, I think,
                     a little disappointed. There is a fragrance in the unfolding of a passion, that
                     escapes the perfect flower. Jenny thought the night was not as beautiful;
                     Ridgeway, that the long ride had blunted his perceptions. But they had the
                     frankness to confess it to each other, with the rare delight of such a<pb
                        n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6648-00000023"/> confession, and the comparison of
                     details which they thought each had forgotten. And with this, and an occasional
                     pitying reference to the blank period when they had not known each other, hand
                     in hand they reached the house.</p>
                  <p>Mr. McClosky was awaiting them impatiently upon the veranda. When Miss Jenny
                     had slipped up stairs to replace a collar that stood somewhat suspiciously
                     awry, Mr. McClosky drew Ridgeway solemnly aside. He held a large theatre poster
                     in one hand, and an open newspaper in the other.</p>
                  <p>"I allus said," he remarked slowly, with the air of merely renewing a suspended
                     conversation,—"I allus said that riding three horses to onct wasn't exactly in
                     her line. It would seem that it ain't. From remarks in this yer paper, it would
                     appear that she tried it on at Marysville last week, and broke her neck."</p>

               <head>A PASSAGE IN THE LIFE OF MR. JOHN OAKHURST.</head>
               <p>HE always thought it must have been fate. Certainly nothing could have been more
                  inconsistent with his habits than to have been in the Plaza at seven o'clock of
                  that midsummer morning. The sight of his colorless face in Sacramento was rare at
                  that season, and, indeed, at any season, anywhere publicly, before two o'clock in
                  the afternoon. Looking back upon it in after-years in the light of a chanceful
                  life, he determined, with the characteristic philosophy of his profession, that it
                  must have been fate.</p>
               <p>Yet it is my duty, as a strict chronicler of facts, to state that Mr. Oakhurst's
                  presence there that morning was due to a very simple cause. At exactly half-past
                  six, the bank being then a winner to the amount of twenty thousand dollars, he had
                  risen from the faro-table, relinquished his seat to an accomplished assistant, and
                  withdrawn quietly, without attracting a glance from the silent, anxious faces
                  bowed over the table. But when he entered his luxurious<pb n="42-43"
                     xml:id="VAC6648-00000024"/> urious sleeping-room, across the passage-way, he
                  was a little shocked at finding the sun streaming through an inadvertently opened
                  window. Something in the rare beauty of the morning, perhaps something in the
                  novelty of the idea, struck him as he was about to close the blinds; and he
                  hesitated. Then, taking his hat from the table, he stepped down a private
                  staircase into the street.</p>
               <p>The people who were abroad at that early hour were of a class quite unknown to Mr.
                  Oakhurst. There were milkmen and hucksters delivering their wares, small
                  tradespeople opening their shops, housemaids sweeping doorsteps, and occasionally
                  a child. These Mr. Oakhurst regarded with a certain cold curiosity, perhaps quite
                  free from the cynical disfavor with which he generally looked upon the more
                  pretentious of his race whom he was in the habit of meeting. Indeed, I think he
                  was not altogether displeased with the admiring glances which these humble women
                  threw after his handsome face and figure, conspicuous even in a country of
                  fine-looking men. While it is very probable that this wicked vagabond, in the
                  pride of his social isolation, would have been coldly indifferent to the advances
                  of a fine lady, a little girl who ran admiringly by his side in a ragged dress had
                  the power to call a faint flush into his colorless cheek. He dismissed her at
                  last, but not until she had found out—what, sooner or later, her large-hearted and
                  discriminating sex inevitably did—that he was exceedingly free and openhanded with
                  his money, and also—what, perhaps, none other of her sex ever did—that the bold
                  black eyes of this fine gentleman were in reality of a brownish and even tender
                  gray.</p>
               <p>There was a small garden before a white cottage in a side-street, that attracted
                  Mr. Oakhurst's attention. It was filled with roses, heliotrope, and
                  verbena,—flowers familiar enough to him in the expensive and more portable form of
                  bouquets, but, as it seemed to him then, never before so notably lovely. Perhaps
                  it was because the dew was yet fresh upon them; perhaps it was because they were
                  unplucked: but Mr. Oakhurst admired them—not as a possible future tribute to the
                  fascinating and accomplished Miss Ethelinda, then performing at the Varieties, for
                  Mr. Oakhurst's especial benefit, as she had often assured him; nor yet as a
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">douceur</foreign> to the inthralling Miss Montmorrissy,
                  with whom Mr. Oakhurst expected to sup that evening; but simply for himself, and,
                  mayhap, for the flowers' sake. Howbeit he passed on, and so out into the open
                  Plaza, where, finding a bench under a cottonwood-tree, he first dusted the seat
                  with his handkerchief, and then sat down.</p>
               <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6648-00000025"/>
               <p>It was a fine morning. The air was so still and calm, that a sigh from the
                  sycamores seemed like the deep-drawn breath of the just awakening tree, and the
                  faint rustle of its boughs as the outstretching of cramped and reviving limbs. Far
                  away the Sierras stood out against a sky so remote as to be of no positive
                  color,—so remote, that even the sun despaired of ever reaching it, and so expended
                  its strength recklessly on the whole landscape, until it fairly glittered in a
                  white and vivid contrast. With a very rare impulse, Mr. Oakhurst took off his hat,
                  and half reclined on the bench, with his face to the sky. Certain birds who had
                  taken a critical attitude on a spray above him, apparently began an animated
                  discussion regarding his possible malevolent intentions. One or two, emboldened by
                  the silence, hopped on the ground at his feet, until the sound of wheels on the
                  gravel-walk frightened them away.</p>
               <p>Looking up, he saw a man coming slowly toward him, wheeling a nondescript vehicle,
                  in which a woman was partly sitting, partly reclining. Without knowing why, Mr.
                  Oakhurst instantly conceived that the carriage was the invention and workmanship
                  of the man, partly from its oddity, partly from the strong, mechanical hand that
                  grasped it, and partly from a certain pride and visible consciousness in the
                  manner in which the man handled it. Then Mr. Oakhurst saw something more: the
                  man's face was familiar. With that regal faculty of not forgetting a face that had
                  ever given him professional audience, he instantly classified it under the
                  following mental formula: "At 'Frisco, Polka Saloon. Lost his week's wages. I
                  reckon—seventy dollars—on red. Never came again." There was, however, no trace of
                  this in the calm eyes and unmoved face that he turned upon the stranger, who, on
                  the contrary, blushed, looked embarrassed, hesitated, and then stopped with an
                  involuntary motion that brought the carriage and its fair occupant face to face
                  with Mr. Oakhurst.</p>
               <p>I should hardly do justice to the position she will occupy in this veracious
                  chronicle by describing the lady now, if, indeed, I am able to do it at all.
                  Certainly the popular estimate was conflicting. The late Col. Starbottle—to whose
                  large experience of a charming sex I have before been indebted for many valuable
                  suggestions—had, I regret to say, depreciated her fascinations. "A yellow-faced
                  cripple, by dash! a sick woman, with mahogany eyes; one of your blanked spiritual
                  creatures—with no flesh on her bones." On the other hand, however, she enjoyed
                  later much complimentary disparagement from her own sex. Miss Celestina Howard,<pb
                     n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6648-00000026"/> second leader in the <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">ballet</foreign> at the Varieties, had, with great alliterative
                  directness, in after-years, denominated her as an "aquiline asp." Mlle. Brimborion
                  remembered that she had always warned "Mr. Jack" that this woman would "empoison"
                  him. But Mr. Oakhurst, whose impressions are perhaps the most important, only saw
                  a pale, thin, deep-eyed woman, raised above the level of her companion by the
                  refinement of long suffering and isolation, and a certain shy virginity of manner.
                  There was a suggestion of physical purity in the folds of her fresh-looking robe,
                  and a certain picturesque tastefulness in the details, that, without knowing why,
                  made him think that the robe was her invention and handiwork, even as the carriage
                  she occupied was evidently the work of her companion. Her own hand, a trifle too
                  thin, but well-shaped, subtle-fingered, and gentlewomanly, rested on the side of
                  the carriage, the counterpart of the strong mechanical grasp of her
                  companion's.</p>
               <p>There was some obstruction to the progress of the vehicle; and Mr. Oakhurst
                  stepped forward to assist. While the wheel was being lifted over the curbstone, it
                  was necessary that she should hold his arm; and for a moment her thin hand rested
                  there, light and cold as a snowflake, and then, as it seemed to him, like a
                  snow-flake melted away. Then there was a pause, and then conversation, the lady
                  joining occasionally and shyly.</p>
               <p>It appeared that they were man and wife; that for the past two years she had been
                  a great invalid, and had lost the use of her lower limbs from rheumatism; that
                  until lately she had been confined to her bed, until her husband—who was a
                  master-carpenter—had bethought himself to make her this carriage. He took her out
                  regularly for an airing before going to work, because it was his only time,
                  and—they attracted less attention. They had tried many doctors, but without avail.
                  They had been advised to go to the Sulphur Springs; but it was expensive. Mr.
                  Decker, the husband, had once saved eighty dollars for that purpose, but while in
                  San Francisco had his pocket picked—Mr Decker was so senseless! (The intelligent
                  reader need not be told that it is the lady who is speaking.) They had never been
                  able to make up the sum again, and they had given up the idea. It was a dreadful
                  thing to have one's pocket picked. Did he not think so?</p>
               <p>Her husband's face was crimson; but Mr. Oakhurst's countenance was quite calm and
                  unmoved, as he gravely agreed with her, and walked by her side until they passed
                  the little garden that he had admired. Here Mr. Oakhurst<pb n="48-49"
                     xml:id="VAC6648-00000027"/> hurst commanded a halt, and, going to the door,
                  astounded the proprietor by a preposterously extravagant offer for a choice of the
                  flowers. Presently he returned to the carriage with his arms full of roses,
                  heliotrope, and verbena, and cast them in the lap of the invalid. While she was
                  bending over them with childish delight, Mr. Oakhurst took the opportunity of
                  drawing her husband aside.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps," he said in a low voice, and a manner quite free from any personal
                  annoyance,—"perhaps it's just as well that you lied to her as you did. You can say
                  now that the pickpocket was arrested the other day, and you got your money back."
                  Mr. Oakhurst quietly slipped four twenty-dollar gold-pieces into the broad hand of
                  the bewildered Mr. Decker. "Say that—or any thing you like—but the truth. Promise
                  me you won't say that."</p>
               <p>The man promised. Mr. Oakhurst quietly returned to the front of the little
                  carriage. The sick woman was still eagerly occupied with the flowers, and, as she
                  raised her eyes to his, her faded cheek seemed to have caught some color from the
                  roses, and her eyes some of their dewy freshness. But at that instant Mr. Oakhurst
                  lifted his hat, and before she could thank him was gone.</p>
               <p>I grieve to say that Mr. Decker shamelessly broke his promise. That night, in the
                  very goodness of his heart and uxorious self-abnegation, he, like all devoted
                  husbands, not only offered himself, but his friend and benefactor, as a sacrifice
                  on the family-altar. It is only fair, however, to add that he spoke with great
                  fervor of the generosity of Mr. Oakhurst, and dwelt with an enthusiasm quite
                  common with his class on the mysterious fame and prodigal vices of the
                  gambler.</p>
               <p>"And now, Elsie dear, say that you'll forgive me," said Mr. Decker, dropping on
                  one knee beside his wife's couch. "I did it for the best. It was for you, dearey,
                  that I put that money on them cards that night in 'Frisco. I thought to win a
                  heap—enough to take you away, and enough left to get you a new dress."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Decker smiled, and pressed her husband's hand. "I do forgive you, Joe dear,"
                  she said, still smiling, with eyes abstractedly fixed on the ceiling; "and you
                  ought to be whipped for deceiving me so, you bad boy! and making me make such a
                  speech. There, say no more about it. If you'll be very good hereafter, and will
                  just now hand me that cluster of roses, I'll forgive you." She took the branch in
                  her fingers, lifted the roses to her face, and presently said, behind their
                  leaves,—</p>
               <p>"Joe!"</p>
               <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6648-00000028"/>
               <p>"What is it, lovey?"</p>
               <p>"Do you think that this Mr.—what do you call him?—Jack Oakhurst would have given
                  that money back to you, if I hadn't made that speech?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"If he hadn't seen me at all?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Decker looked up. His wife had managed in some way to cover up her whole face
                  with the roses, except her eyes, which were dangerously bright.</p>
               <p>"No! It was you, Elsie—it was all along of seeing you that made him do it."</p>
               <p>"A poor sick woman like me?"</p>
               <p>"A sweet, little, lovely, pooty Elsie—Joe's own little wifey! How could he help
                  it?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Decker fondly cast one arm around her husband's neck, still keeping the roses
                  to her face with the other. From behind them she began to murmur gently and
                  idiotically, "Dear, ole square Joey. Elsie's oney booful big bear." But, really, I
                  do not see that my duty as a chronicler of facts compels me to continue this
                  little lady's speech any further; and, out of respect to the unmarried reader, I
                  stop.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, the next morning Mrs. Decker betrayed some slight and apparently
                  uncalled for irritability on reaching the Plaza, and presently desired her husband
                  to wheel her back home. Moreover, she was very much astonished at meeting Mr.
                  Oakhurst just as they were returning, and even doubted if it were he, and
                  questioned her husband as to his identity with the stranger of yesterday as he
                  approached. Her manner to Mr. Oakhurst, also, was quite in contrast with her
                  husband's frank welcome. Mr. Oakhurst instantly detected it. "Her husband has told
                  her all, and she dislikes me," he said to himself, with that fatal appreciation of
                  the half-truths of a woman's motives that causes the wisest masculine critic to
                  stumble, He lingered only long enough to take the business address of the husband,
                  and then lifting his hat gravely, without looking at the lady, went his way. It
                  struck the honest master-carpenter as one of the charming anomalies of his wife's
                  character, that, although the meeting was evidently very much constrained and
                  unpleasant, instantly afterward his wife's spirits began to rise. "You was hard on
                  him, a leetle hard; wasn't you, Elsie?" said Mr. Decker deprecatingly. "I'm afraid
                  he may think I've broke my promise."—"Ah, indeed!" said the lady indifferently.
                  Mr. Decker instantly stepped round to the front of the vehicle. "You look like an
                  A 1 first-class lady riding down Broadway in her own carriage, Elsie," said he. "I
                  never seed you lookin' so peart and sassy before."</p>
               <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6648-00000029"/>
               <p>A few days later, the proprietor of the San Isabel Sulphur Springs received the
                  following note in Mr. Oakhurst's well-known, dainty hand:—</p>

                        <div type="letter">
                           <p>"DEAR STEVE,—I've been thinking over your proposition to buy Nichols's
                              quarter-interest, and have concluded to go in. But I don't see how the
                              thing will pay until you have more accommodation down there, and for
                              the best class,—I mean <emph>my</emph> customers. What we want is an
                              extension to the main building, and two or three cottages put up. I
                              send down a builder to take hold of the job at once. He takes his sick
                              wife with him; and you are to look after them as you would for one of
                              us.</p>
                           <p>"I may run down there myself after the races, just to look after
                              things; but I sha'n't set up any game this season.</p>

               <p>It was only the last sentence of this letter that provoked criticism. "I can
                  understand," said Mr. Hamlin, a professional brother, to whom Mr. Oakhurst's
                  letter was shown,—"I can understand why Jack goes in heavy and builds; for it's a
                  sure spec, and is bound to be a mighty soft thing in time, if he comes here
                  regularly. But why in blank he don't set up a bank this season, and take the
                  chance of getting some of the money back that he puts into circulation in
                  building, is what gets me. I wonder now," he mused deeply, "what <emph>is</emph>
                  his little game."</p>
               <p>The season had been a prosperous one to Mr. Oakhurst, and proportionally
                  disastrous to several members of the legislature, judges, colonels, and others who
                  had enjoyed but briefly the pleasure of Mr. Oakhurst's midnight society. And yet
                  Sacramento had become very dull to him. He had lately formed a habit of early
                  morning walks, so unusual and startling to his friends, both male and female, as
                  to occasion the intensest curiosity. Two or three of the latter set spies upon his
                  track; but the inquisition resulted only in the discovery that Mr. Oakhurst walked
                  to the Plaza, sat down upon one particular bench for a few moments, and then
                  returned without seeing anybody; and the theory that there was a woman in the case
                  was abandoned. A few superstitious gentlemen of his own profession believed that
                  he did it for "luck." Some others, more practical, declared that he went out to
                  "study points."</p>
               <p>After the races at Marysville, Mr. Oakhurst went to San Francisco; from that place
                  he returned to Marysville, but a few days after was seen at San José, Santa Cruz,
                  and Oakland. Those who met him declared that his manner was restless and feverish,
                  and quite unlike his ordinary calmness and phlegm. Col. Starbottle pointed out the
                  fact, that at San Francisco, at the club, Jack had declined to deal. "Hand<pb
                     n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6648-00000030"/> shaky, sir; depend upon it. Don't
                  stimulate enough—blank him!"</p>
               <p>From San José he started to go to Oregon by land with a rather expensive outfit of
                  horses and camp equipage; but, on reaching Stockton, he suddenly diverged, and
                  four hours later found him with a single horse entering the cañon of the San
                  Isabel Warm Sulphur Springs.</p>
               <p>It was a pretty triangular valley lying at the foot of three sloping mountains,
                  dark with pines, and fantastic with madrono and manzanita. Nestling against the
                  mountain-side, the straggling buildings and long piazza of the hotel glittered
                  through the leaves, and here and there shone a white toy-like cottage. Mr.
                  Oakhurst was not an admirer of Nature; but he felt something of the same novel
                  satisfaction in the view, that he experienced in his first morning walk in
                  Sacramento. And now carriages began to pass him on the road filled with
                  gayly-dressed women; and the cold California outlines of the landscape began to
                  take upon themselves somewhat of a human warmth and color. And then the long hotel
                  piazza came in view, efflorescent with the full-toiletted fair. Mr. Oakhurst, a
                  good rider after the California fashion, did not check his speed as he approached
                  his destination, but charged the hotel at a gallop, threw his horse on his
                  haunches within a foot of the piazza, and then quietly emerged from the cloud of
                  dust that veiled his dismounting.</p>
               <p>Whatever feverish excitement might have raged within, all his habitual calm
                  returned as he stepped upon the piazza. With the instinct of long habit, he turned
                  and faced the battery of eyes with the same cold indifference with which he had
                  for years encountered the half-hidden sneers of men and the half-frightened
                  admiration of women. Only one person stepped forward to welcome him. Oddly enough,
                  it was Dick Hamilton, perhaps the only one present, who by birth, education, and
                  position, might have satisfied the most fastidious social critic. Happily for Mr.
                  Oakhurst's reputation, he was also a very rich banker and social leader. "Do you
                  know who that is you spoke to?" asked young Parker with an alarmed expression.
                  "Yes," replied Hamilton with characteristic effrontery. "The man you lost a
                  thousand dollars to last week. <emph>I</emph> only know him
                  <emph>socially</emph>." "But isn't he a gambler?" queried the youngest Miss Smith.
                  "He is," replied Hamilton; "but I wish, my dear young lady, that we all played as
                  open and honest a game as our friend yonder, and were as willing as he is to abide
                  by its fortunes."</p>
               <p>But Mr. Oakhurst was happily out of hearing of this colloquy, and was even then
                     lounging<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6648-00000031"/> ging listlessly yet
                  watchfully along the upper hall. Suddenly he heard a light footstep behind him,
                  and then his name called in a familiar voice that drew the blood quickly to his
                  heart. He turned, and she stood before him.</p>
               <p>But how transformed! If I have hesitated to describe the hollow-eyed cripple, the
                  quaintly-dressed artisan's wife, a few pages ago, what shall I do with this
                  graceful, shapely, elegantly-attired gentlewoman into whom she has been merged
                  within these two months? In good faith she was very pretty. You and I, my dear
                  madam, would have been quick to see that those charming dimples were misplaced for
                  true beauty, and too fixed in their quality for honest mirthfulness; that the
                  delicate lines around these aquiline nostrils were cruel and selfish; that the
                  sweet virginal surprise of these lovely eyes were as apt to be opened on her plate
                  as upon the gallant speeches of her dinner partner; that her sympathetic color
                  came and went more with her own spirits than yours. But you and I are not in love
                  with her, dear madam, and Mr. Oakhurst is. And, even in the folds of her Parisian
                  gown, I am afraid this poor fellow saw the same subtle strokes of purity that he
                  had seen in her homespun robe. And then there was the delightful revelation that
                  she could walk, and that she had dear little feet of her own in the tiniest
                  slippers of her French shoemaker, with such preposterous blue bows, and Chappell's
                  own stamp—Rue de something or other, Paris—on the narrow sole.</p>
               <p>He ran toward her with a heightened color and outstretched hands. But she whipped
                  her own behind her, glanced rapidly up and down the long hall, and stood looking
                  at him with a half-audacious, half-mischievous admiration, in utter contrast to
                  her old reserve.</p>
               <p>"I've a great mind not to shake hands with you at all. You passed me just now on
                  the piazza without speaking; and I ran after you, as I suppose many another poor
                  woman has done."</p>
               <p>Mr. Oakhurst stammered that she was so changed.</p>
               <p>"The more reason why you should know me. Who changed me? You. You have recreated
                  me. You found a helpless, crippled, sick, poverty-stricken woman, with one dress
                  to her back, and that her own make, and you gave her life, health, strength, and
                  fortune. You did; and you know it, sir. How do you like your work?" She caught the
                  side-seams of her gown in either hand, and dropped him a playful courtesy. Then,
                  with a sudden, relenting gesture, she gave him both her hands.</p>
               <p>Outrageous as this speech was, and unfeminine as I trust every fair reader will
                  deem it,<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6648-00000032"/> I fear it pleased Mr. Oakhurst.
                  Not but that he was accustomed to a certain frank female admiration; but then it
                  was of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coulisse</foreign>, and not of the cloister,
                  with which he always persisted in associating Mrs. Decker. To be addressed in this
                  way by an invalid Puritan, a sick saint with the austerity of suffering still
                  clothing her, a woman who had a Bible on the dressing-table, who went to church
                  three times a day, and was devoted to her husband, completely bowled him over. He
                  still held her hands as she went on,—</p>
               <p>"Why didn't you come before? What were you doing in Marysville, in San José, in
                  Oakland? You see I have followed you. I saw you as you came down the cañon, and
                  knew you at once. I saw your letter to Joseph, and knew you were coming. Why
                  didn't you write to me? You will some time!—Good-evening, Mr. Hamilton."</p>
               <p>She had withdrawn her hands, but not until Hamilton, ascending the staircase, was
                  nearly abreast of them. He raised his hat to her with well-bred composure, nodded
                  familiarly to Oakhurst, and passed on. When he had gone, Mrs. Decker lifted her
                  eyes to Mr. Oakhurst. "Some day I shall ask a great favor of you."</p>
               <p>Mr. Oakhurst begged that it should be now. "No, not until you know me better.
                  Then, some day, I shall want you to—kill that man!"</p>
               <p>She laughed such a pleasant little ringing laugh, such a display of
                  dimples,—albeit a little fixed in the corners of her mouth,—such an innocent light
                  in her brown eyes, and such a lovely color in her cheeks, that Mr. Oakhurst (who
                  seldom laughed) was fain to laugh too. It was as if a lamb had proposed to a fox a
                  foray into a neighboring sheepfold.</p>
               <p>A few evenings after this, Mrs. Decker arose from a charmed circle of her admirers
                  on the hotel piazza, excused herself for a few moments, laughingly declined an
                  escort, and ran over to her little cottage—one of her husband's creation—across
                  the road. Perhaps from the sudden and unwonted exercise in her still convalescent
                  state, she breathed hurriedly and feverishly as she entered her boudoir, and once
                  or twice placed her hand upon her breast. She was startled on turning up the light
                  to find her husband lying on the sofa.</p>
               <p>"You look hot and excited, Elsie love," said Mr. Decker. "You ain't took worse,
                  are you?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Decker's face had paled, but now flushed again. "No," she said; "only a
                  little pain here," as she again placed her hand upon her corsage.</p>
               <p>"Can I do any thing for you?" said Mr. Desker, rising with affectionate
                  concern.</p>
               <p>"Run over to the hotel and get me some brandy, quick!"</p>
               <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6648-00000033"/>
               <p>Mr. Decker ran. Mrs. Decker closed and bolted the door, and then, putting her hand
                  to her bosom, drew out the pain. It was folded foursquare, and was, I grieve to
                  say, in Mr. Oakhurst's handwriting.</p>
               <p>She devoured it with burning eyes and cheeks until there came a step upon the
                  porch; then she hurriedly replaced it in her bosom, and unbolted the door. Her
                  husband entered. She raised the spirits to her lips, and declared herself
                  better.</p>
               <p>"Are you going over there again tonight?" asked Mr. Decker submissively.</p>
               <p>"No," said Mrs. Decker, with her eyes fixed dreamily on the floor.</p>
               <p>"I wouldn't if I was you," said Mr. Decker with a sigh of relief. After a pause,
                  he took a seat on the sofa, and, drawing his wife to his side, said, "Do you know
                  what I was thinking of when you came in, Elsie?" Mrs. Decker ran her fingers
                  through his stiff black hair, and couldn't imagine.</p>
               <p>"I was thinking of old times, Elsie: I was thinking of the days when I built that
                  kerridge for you, Elsie,—when I used to take you out to ride, and was both hoss
                  and driver. We was poor then, and you was sick, Elsie; but we was happy. We've got
                  money now, and a house; and you're quite another woman. I may say, dear, that
                  you're a <emph>new</emph> woman. And that's where the trouble comes in. I could
                  build you a kerridge, Elsie; I could build you a house, Elsie—but there I stopped.
                  I couldn't build up <emph>you</emph>. You're strong and pretty, Elsie, and fresh
                  and new. But somehow, Elsie, you ain't no work of mine!"</p>
               <p>He paused. With one hand laid gently on his forehead, and the other pressed upon
                  her bosom, as if to feel certain of the presence of her pain, she said sweetly and
                  soothingly,—</p>
               <p>"But it was your work, dear."</p>
               <p>Mr. Decker shook his head sorrowfully. "No, Elsie, not mine. I had the chance to
                  do it once, and I let it go. It's done now—but not by me."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Decker raised her surprised, innocent eyes to his. He kissed her tenderly,
                  and then went on in a more cheerful voice,—</p>
               <p>"That ain't all I was thinking of, Elsie. I was thinking that maybe you give too
                  much of your company to that Mr. Hamilton. Not that there's any wrong in it, to
                  you or him; but it might make people talk. You're the only one here, Elsie," said
                  the master-carpenter, looking fondly at his wife, "who isn't talked about, whose
                  work ain't inspected or condemned."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Decker was glad he had spoken about it. She had thought so too. But she could
                  not well<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6648-00000034"/> be uncivil to Mr. Hamilton, who
                  was a fine gentleman, without making a powerful enemy. "And he's always treated me
                  as if I was a born lady in his own circle," added the little woman, with a certain
                  pride that made her husband fondly smile. "But I have thought of a plan. He will
                  not stay here if I should go away. If, for instance, I went to San Francisco to
                  visit ma for a few days, he would be gone before I should return."</p>
               <p>Mr. Decker was delighted. "By all means," he said, "go tomorrow. Jack Oakhurst is
                  going down; and I'll put you in his charge."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Decker did not think it was prudent. "Mr. Oakhurst is our friend, Joseph; but
                  you know his reputation." In fact, she did not know that she ought to go now,
                  knowing that he was going the same day; but, with a kiss, Mr. Decker overcame her
                  scruples. She yielded gracefully. Few women, in fact, knew how to give up a point
                  as charmingly as she.</p>
               <p>She staid a week in San Francisco. When she returned, she was a trifle thinner and
                  paler than she had been. This she explained as the result of perhaps too active
                  exercise and excitement. "I was out of doors nearly all the time, as ma will tell
                  you," she said to her husband, "and always alone. I am getting quite independent
                  now," she added gayly. "I don't want any escort. I believe, Joey dear, I could get
                  along even without you, I'm so brave!"</p>
               <p>But her visit, apparently, had not been productive of her impelling design. Mr.
                  Hamilton had not gone, but had remained, and called upon them that very evening.
                  "I've thought of a plan, Joey dear," said Mrs. Decker, when he had departed. "Poor
                  Mr. Oakhurst has a miserable room at the hotel. Suppose you ask him, when he
                  returns from San Francisco, to stop with us. He can have our spare-room. I don't
                  think," she added archly, "that Mr. Hamilton will call often." Her husband
                  laughed, intimated that she was a little coquette, pinched her cheek, and
                  complied. "The queer thing about a woman," he said afterward confidentially to Mr.
                  Oakhurst, "is, that, without having any plan of her own, she'll take anybody's,
                  and build a house on it entirely different to suit herself. And dern my skin if
                  you'll be able to say whether or not you didn't give the scale and measurements
                  yourself! That's what gets me!"</p>
               <p>The next week Mr. Oakhurst was installed in the Deckers' cottage. The business
                  relations of her husband and himself were known to all, and her own reputation was
                  above suspicion. Indeed, few women were more popular. She was domestic, she was
                  prudent, she was pious. In a country of great feminine freedom and latitude,<pb
                     n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6648-00000035"/> she never rode or walked with anybody but
                  her husband. In an epoch of slang and ambiguous expression, she was always precise
                  and formal in her speech. In the midst of a fashion of ostentatious decoration,
                  she never wore a diamond, nor a single valuable jewel. She never permitted an
                  indecorum in public. She never countenanced the familiarities of California
                  society. She declaimed against the prevailing tone of infidelity and scepticism in
                  religion. Few people who were present will ever forget the dignified yet stately
                  manner with which she rebuked Mr. Hamilton in the public parlor for entering upon
                  the discussion of a work on materialism, lately published; and some among them,
                  also, will not forget the expression of amused surprise on Mr. Hamilton's face,
                  that gradually changed to sardonic gravity, as he courteously waived his point;
                  certainly not Mr. Oakhurst, who, from that moment, began to be uneasily impatient
                  of his friend, and even—if such a term could be applied to any moral quality in
                  Mr. Oakhurst—to fear him.</p>
               <p>For during this time Mr. Oakhurst had begun to show symptoms of a change in his
                  usual habits. He was seldom, if ever, seen in his old haunts, in a bar-room, or
                  with his old associates. Pink and white notes, in distracted handwriting,
                  accumulated on the dressing-table in his rooms at Sacramento. It was given out in
                  San Francisco that he had some organic disease of the heart, for which his
                  physician had prescribed perfect rest. He read more; he took long walks; he sold
                  his fast horses; he went to church.</p>
               <p>I have a very vivid recollection of his first appearance there. He did not
                  accompany the Deckers, nor did he go into their pew, but came in as the service
                  commenced, and took a seat quietly in one of the back-pews. By some mysterious
                  instinct, his presence became presently known to the congregation, some of whom so
                  far forgot themselves, in their curiosity, as to face around, and apparently
                  address their responses to him. Before the service was over, it was pretty well
                  understood that "miserable sinners" meant Mr. Oakhurst. Nor did this mysterious
                  influence fail to affect the officiating clergyman, who introduced an allusion to
                  Mr. Oakhurst's calling and habits in a sermon on the architecture of Solomon's
                  temple, and in a manner so pointed, and yet labored, as to cause the youngest of
                  us to flame with indignation. Happily, however, it was lost upon Jack: I do not
                  think he even heard it. His handsome, colorless face, albeit a trifle worn and
                  thoughtful, was inscrutable. Only once, during the singing of a hymn, at a certain
                  note in the contralto's voice, there crept into his dark eyes a look of wistful<pb
                     n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6648-00000036"/> tenderness, so yearning and yet so
                  hopeless, that those who were watching him felt their own glisten. Yet I retain a
                  very vivid remembrance of his standing up to receive the benediction, with the
                  suggestion, in his manner and tightly-buttoned coat, of taking the fire of his
                  adversary at ten paces. After church, he disappeared as quietly as he had entered,
                  and fortunately escaped hearing the comments on his rash act. His appearance was
                  generally considered as an impertinence, attributable only to some wanton fancy,
                  or possibly a bet. One or two thought that the sexton was exceedingly remiss in
                  not turning him out after discovering who he was; and a prominent pew-holder
                  remarked, that if he couldn't take his wife and daughters to that church, without
                  exposing them to such an influence, he would try to find some church where he
                  could. Another traced Mr. Oakhurst's presence to certain Broad Church radical
                  tendencies, which he regretted to say he had lately noted in their pastor. Deacon
                  Sawyer, whose delicately-organized, sickly wife had already borne him eleven
                  children, and died in an ambitious attempt to complete the dozen, avowed that the
                  presence of a person of Mr. Oakhurst's various and indiscriminate gallantries was
                  an insult to the memory of the deceased, that, as a man, he could not brook.</p>
               <p>It was about this time that Mr. Oakhurst, contrasting himself with a conventional
                  world in which he had hitherto rarely mingled, became aware that there was
                  something in his face, figure, and carriage quite unlike other men,—something,
                  that, if it did not betray his former career, at least showed an individuality and
                  originality that was suspicious. In this belief, he shaved off his long, silken
                  mustache, and religiously brushed out his clustering curls every morning. He even
                  went so far as to affect a negligence of dress, and hid his small, slim, arched
                  feet in the largest and heaviest walking shoes. There is a story told that he went
                  to his tailor in Sacramento, and asked him to make him a suit of clothes like
                  everybody else. The tailor, familiar with Mr. Oakhurst's fastidiousness, did not
                  know what he meant. "I mean," said Mr. Oakhurst savagely, "something
                     <emph>respectable</emph>,—something that doesn't exactly fit me, you know."
                  But, however Mr. Oakhurst might hide his shapely limbs in homespun and home made
                  garments, there was something in his carriage, something in the pose of his
                  beautiful head, something in the strong and fine manliness of his presence,
                  something in the perfect and utter discipline and control of his muscles,
                  something in the high repose of his nature,—a repose not so much a matter of
                  intellectual ruling<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6648-00000037"/> ing as of his very
                  nature,—that, go where he would, and with whom, he was always a notable man in ten
                  thousand. Perhaps this was never so clearly intimated to Mr. Oakhurst, as when,
                  emboldened by Mr. Hamilton's advice and assistance, and his own predilections, he
                  became a San-Francisco broker. Even before objection was made to his presence in
                  the Board,—the objection, I remember, was urged very eloquently by Watt Sanders,
                  who was supposed to be the inventor of the "freezing-out" system of disposing of
                  poor stockholders, and who also enjoyed the reputation of having been the
                  impelling cause of Briggs of Tuolumne's ruin and suicide,—even before this formal
                  protest of respectability against lawlessness, the aquiline suggestions of Mr.
                  Oakhurst's mien and countenance, not only prematurely fluttered the pigeons, but
                  absolutely occasioned much uneasiness among the fish-hawks who circled below him
                  with their booty. "Dash me! but he's as likely to go after us as anybody," said
                  Joe Fielding.</p>
               <p>It wanted but a few days before the close of the brief summer season at San Isabel
                  Warm Springs. Already there had been some migration of the more fashionable; and
                  there was an uncomfortable suggestion of dregs and lees in the social life that
                  remained. Mr. Oakhurst was moody. It was hinted that even the secure reputation of
                  Mrs. Decker could no longer protect her from the gossip which his presence
                  excited. It is but fair to her to say, that, during the last few weeks of this
                  trying ordeal, she looked like a sweet, pale martyr, and conducted herself toward
                  her traducers with the gentle, forgiving manner of one who relied not upon the
                  idle homage of the crowd, but upon the security of a principle that was dearer
                  than popular favor. "They talk about myself and Mr. Oakhurst, my dear," she said
                  to a friend; "but heaven and my husband can best answer their calumny. It never
                  shall be said that my husband ever turned his back upon a friend in the moment of
                  his adversity, because the position was changed,—because his friend was poor, and
                  he was rich." This was the first intimation to the public that Jack had lost
                  money, although it was known generally that the Deckers had lately bought some
                  valuable property in San Francisco.</p>
               <p>A few evenings after this, an incident occurred which seemed to unpleasantly
                  discord with the general social harmony that had always existed at San Isabel. It
                  was at dinner; and Mr. Oakhurst and Mr. Hamilton, who sat together at a separate
                  table, were observed to rise in some<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6648-00000038"/>
                  agitation. When they reached the hall, by a common instinct they stepped into a
                  little breakfast-room which was vacant, and closed the door. Then Mr. Hamilton
                  turned with a half-amused, half-serious smile toward his friend, and said,—</p>
               <p>"If we are to quarrel, Jack Oakhurst,—you and I,—in the name of all that is
                  ridiculous, don't let it be about a"—</p>
               <p>I do not know what was the epithet intended. It was either unspoken or lost; for
                  at that very instant Mr. Oakhurst raised a wineglass, and dashed its contents into
                  Hamilton's face.</p>
               <p>As they faced each other, the men seemed to have changed natures. Mr. Oakhurst was
                  trembling with excitement, and the wineglass that he returned to the table
                  shivered between his fingers. Mr. Hamilton stood there, grayish white, erect, and
                  dripping. After a pause, he said coldly,—</p>
               <p>"So be it. But remember, our quarrel commences here. If I fall by your hand, you
                  shall not use it to clear her character: if you fall by mine, you shall not be
                  called a martyr. I am sorry it has come to this; but amen, the sooner now, the
                  better."</p>
               <p>He turned proudly, dropped his lids over his cold steel-blue eyes, as if sheathing
                  a rapier, bowed, and passed coldly out.</p>
               <p>They met, twelve hours later, in a little hollow two miles from the hotel, on the
                  Stockton road. As Mr. Oakhurst received his pistol from Col. Starbottle's hands,
                  he said to him in a low voice, "Whatever turns up or down, I shall not return to
                  the hotel. You will find some directions in my room. Go there"—But his voice
                  suddenly faltered, and he turned his glistening eyes away, to his second's intense
                  astonishment. "I've been out a dozen times with Jack Oakhurst," said Col.
                  Starbottle afterward, "and I never saw him anyways cut before. Blank me if I
                  didn't think he was losing his sand, till he walked to position."</p>
               <p>The two reports were almost simultaneous. Mr. Oakhurst's right arm dropped
                  suddenly to his side, and his pistol would have fallen from his paralyzed fingers;
                  but the discipline of trained nerve and muscle prevailed, and he kept his grasp
                  until he had shifted it to the other hand, without changing his position. Then
                  there was a silence that seemed interminable, a gathering of two or three dark
                  figures where a smoke-curl still lazily floated, and then the hurried, husky,
                  panting voice of Col. Starbottle in his ear, "He's hit hard—through the lungs—you
                  must run for it!"</p>
               <p>Jack turned his dark, questioning eyes upon his second, but did not seem to
                     listen,—rather<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6648-00000039"/> seemed to hear some
                  other voice, remoter in the distance. He hesitated, and then made a step forward
                  in the direction of the distant group. Then he paused again as the figures
                  separated, and the surgeon came hastily toward him.</p>
               <p>"He would like to speak with you a moment," said the man. "You have little time to
                  lose, I know; but," he added in a lower voice, "it is my duty to tell you he has
                  still less."</p>
               <p>A look of despair, so hopeless in its intensity, swept over Mr. Oakhurst's usually
                  impassive face, that the surgeon started. "You are hit," he said, glancing at
                  Jack's helpless arm.</p>
               <p>"Nothing—a mere scratch," said Jack hastily. Then he added with a bitter laugh,
                  "I'm not in luck to-day. But come: we'll see what he wants."</p>
               <p>His long, feverish stride outstripped the surgeon's; and in another moment he
                  stood where the dying man lay,—like most dying men,—the one calm, composed,
                  central figure of an anxious group. Mr. Oakhurst's face was less calm as he
                  dropped on one knee beside him, and took his hand. "I want to speak with this
                  gentleman alone," said Hamilton, with something of his old imperious manner, as he
                  turned to those about him. When they drew back, he looked up in Oakhurst's
                  face.</p>
               <p>"I've something to tell you, Jack."</p>
               <p>His own face was white, but not so white as that which Mr. Oakhurst bent over
                  him,—a face so ghastly, with haunting doubts, and a hopeless presentiment of
                  coming evil,—a face so piteous in its infinite weariness and envy of death, that
                  the dying man was touched, even in the languor of dissolution, with a pang of
                  compassion; and the cynical smile faded from his lips.</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, Jack," he whispered more feebly, "for what I have to say. I don't say
                  it in anger, but only because it must be said. I could not do my duty to you, I
                  could not die contented, until you knew it all. It's a miserable business at best,
                  all around. But it can't be helped now. Only I ought to have fallen by Decker's
                  pistol, and not yours."</p>
               <p>A flush like fire came into Jack's cheek, and he would have risen; but Hamilton
                  held him fast.</p>
               <p>"Listen! In my pocket you will find two letters. Take them—there! You will know
                  the handwriting. But promise you will not read them until you are in a place of
                  safety. Promise me."</p>
               <p>Jack did not speak, but held the letters between his fingers as if they had been
                  burning coals.</p>
               <p>"Promise me," said Hamilton faintly.</p>
               <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6648-00000040"/>
               <p>"Why?" asked Oakhurst, dropping his friend's hand coldly.</p>
               <p>"Because," said the dying man with a bitter smile,—"because—when you have read
                  them—you—will—go back—to capture—and death!"</p>
               <p>They were his last words. He pressed Jack's hand faintly. Then his grasp relaxed,
                  and he fell back a corpse.</p>
               <p>It was nearly ten o'clock at night, and Mrs. Decker reclined languidly upon the
                  sofa with a novel in her hand, while her husband discussed the politics of the
                  country in the bar-room of the hotel. It was a warm night; and the French window
                  looking out upon a little balcony was partly open. Suddenly she heard a foot upon
                  the balcony, and she raised her eyes from the book with a slight start. The next
                  moment the window was hurriedly thrust wide, and a man entered.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Decker rose to her feet with a little cry of alarm.</p>
               <p>"For Heaven's sake, Jack, are you mad? He has only gone for a little while—he may
                  return at any moment. Come an hour later, to-morrow, any time when I can get rid
                  of him—but go, now, dear, at once."</p>
               <p>Mr. Oakhurst walked toward the door, bolted it, and then faced her without a word.
                  His face was haggard; his coat-sleeve hung loosely over an arm that was bandaged
                  and bloody.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless her voice did not falter as she turned again toward him. "What has
                  happened, Jack. Why are you here?"</p>
               <p>He opened his coat, and threw two letters in her lap.</p>
               <p>"To return your lover's letters; to kill you—and then myself," he said in a voice
                  so low as to be almost inaudible.</p>
               <p>Among the many virtues of this admirable woman was invincible courage. She did not
                  faint; she did not cry out; she sat quietly down again, folded her hands in her
                  lap, and said calmly,—</p>
               <p>"And why should you not?"</p>
               <p>Had she recoiled, had she shown any fear or contrition, had she essayed an
                  explanation or apology, Mr. Oakhurst would have looked upon it as an evidence of
                  guilt. But there is no quality that courage recognizes so quickly as courage.
                  There is no condition that desperation bows before but desperation. And Mr.
                  Oakhurst's power of analysis was not so keen as to prevent him from confounding
                  her courage with a moral quality. Even in his fury, he could not help admiring
                  this dauntless invalid.</p>
               <p>"Why should you not?" she repeated with a smile. "You gave me life, health, and
                     happiness<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6648-00000041"/> ness, Jack. You gave me your
                  love. Why should you not take what you have given? Go on. I am ready."</p>
               <p>She held out her hands with that same infinite grace of yielding with which she
                  had taken his own on the first day of their meeting at the hotel. Jack raised his
                  head, looked at her for one wild moment, dropped upon his knees beside her, and
                  raised the folds of her dress to his feverish lips. But she was too clever not to
                  instantly see her victory: she was too much of a woman, with all her cleverness,
                  to refrain from pressing that victory home. At the same moment, as with the
                  impulse of an outraged and wounded woman, she rose, and, with an imperious
                  gesture, pointed to the window. Mr. Oakhurst rose in his turn, cast one glance
                  upon her, and without another word passed out of her presence forever.</p>
               <p>When he had gone, she closed the window and bolted it, and, going to the
                  chimney-piece, placed the letters, one by one, in the flame of the candle until
                  they were consumed. I would not have the reader think, that, during this painful
                  operation, she was unmoved. Her hand trembled, and—not being a brute—for some
                  minutes (perhaps longer) she felt very badly, and the corners of her sensitive
                  mouth were depressed. When her husband arrived, it was with a genuine joy that she
                  ran to him, and nestled against his broad breast with a feeling of security that
                  thrilled the honest fellow to the core.</p>
               <p>"But I've heard dreadful news to-night, Elsie," said Mr. Decker, after a few
                  endearments were exchanged.</p>
               <p>"Don't tell me any thing dreadful, dear: I'm not well to-night," she pleaded
                  sweetly.</p>
               <p>"But it's about Mr. Oakhurst and Hamilton."</p>
               <p>"Please!" Mr. Decker could not resist the petitionary grace of those white hands
                  and that sensitive mouth, and took her to his arms. Suddenly he said, "What's
                  that?"</p>
               <p>He was pointing to the bosom of her white dress. Where Mr. Oakhurst had touched
                  her, there was a spot of blood.</p>
               <p>It was nothing: she had slightly cut her hand in closing the window; it shut so
                  hard! If Mr. Decker had remembered to close and bolt the shutter before he went
                  out, he might have saved her this. There was such a genuine irritability and force
                  in this remark, that Mr. Decker was quite overcome by remorse. But Mrs. Decker
                  forgave him with that graciousness which I have before pointed out in these pages.
                  And with the halo of that forgiveness and marital confidence still lingering above
                  the pair, with the reader's permission we will leave them, and return to Mr.
                  Oakhurst.</p>
               <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6648-00000042"/>
               <p>But not for two weeks. At the end of that time, he walked into his rooms in
                  Sacramento, and in his old manner took his seat at the faro-table.</p>
               <p>"How's your arm, Jack?" asked an incautious player.</p>
               <p>There was a smile followed the question, which, however, ceased as Jack looked up
                  quietly at the speaker.</p>
               <p>"It bothers my dealing a little; but I can shoot as well with my left."</p>
               <p>The game was continued in that decorous silence which usually distinguished the
                  table at which Mr. John Oakhurst presided.</p>

               <head>WAN LEE, THE PAGAN.</head>
               <p>AS I opened Hop Sing's letter, there fluttered to the ground a square strip of
                  yellow paper covered with hieroglyphics, which, at first glance, I innocently took
                  to be the label from a pack of Chinese fire-crackers. But the same envelope also
                  contained a smaller strip of rice-paper, with two Chinese characters traced in
                  India ink, that I at once knew to be Hop Sing's visiting-card. The whole, as
                  afterwards literally translated, ran as follows:—</p>

               <p>Admirable, certainly, as was this morality and proverbial wisdom, and although
                  this last axiom was very characteristic of my friend Hop Sing, who was that most
                  sombre of all humorists, a Chinese philosopher, I must confess, that, even after a
                  very free translation, I was at a loss to make any immediate application of the
                  message. Luckily I discovered a third enclosure in the shape of a little note in
                  English, and Hop Sing's own commercial hand. It ran thus:—</p>

                              on Friday evening at eight o'clock. A cup of tea at nine,—sharp.</p>

               </q>
               <p>This explained all. It meant a visit to Hop Sing's warehouse, the opening and
                  exhibition of some rare Chinese novelties and <hi rend="i"/>curios, a chat in the
                  back office, a cup of tea of a perfection unknown beyond these sacred precincts,
                  cigars, and a visit to the Chinese theatre or temple. This was, in fact, the
                  favorite programme of Hop Sing when he exercised his functions of hospitality as
                  the chief factor or superintendent of the Ning Foo Company.</p>
               <p>At eight o'clock on Friday evening, I entered the warehouse of Hop Sing. There was
                  that deliciously commingled mysterious foreign odor that I had so often noticed;
                  there was the old array of uncouth-looking objects, the long procession of jars
                  and crockery, the same singular blending of the grotesque and the mathematically
                  neat and exact, the same endless suggestions of frivolity and fragility, the same
                  want of harmony in colors, that were each, in themselves, beautiful and rare.
                  Kites in the shape of enormous dragons and gigantic butterflies; kites so
                  ingeniously arranged as to utter at intervals, when facing the wind, the cry of a
                  hawk; kites so large as to be beyond any boy's power of restraint,—so large that
                  you understood why kite-flying in China was an amusement for adults; gods of china
                  and bronze so gratuitously ugly as to be beyond any human interest or sympathy
                  from their very impossibility; jars of sweetmeats covered all over with moral
                  sentiments from Confucius; hats that looked like baskets, and baskets that looked
                  like hats; silks so light that I hesitate to record the incredible number of
                  square yards that you might pass through the ring on your little finger,—these,
                  and a great many other indescribable objects, were all familiar to me. I pushed my
                  way through the dimly-lighted warehouse, until I reached the back office, or
                  parlor, where I found Hop Sing waiting to receive me.</p>
               <p>Before I describe him, I want the average reader to discharge from his mind any
                  idea of a<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6648-00000044"/> Chinaman that he may have
                  gathered from the pantomime. He did not wear beautifully scalloped drawers fringed
                  with little bells (I never met a Chinaman who did); he did not habitually carry
                  his forefinger extended before him at right angles with his body; nor did I ever
                  hear him utter the mysterious sentence, "Ching a ring a ring chaw;" nor dance
                  under any provocation. He was, on the whole, a rather grave, decorous, handsome
                  gentleman. His complexion, which extended all over his head, except where his long
                  pig-tail grew, was like a very nice piece of glazed brown paper-muslin. His eyes
                  were black and bright, and his eyelids set at an angle of fifteen degrees; his
                  nose straight, and delicately formed; his mouth small; and his teeth white and
                  clean. He wore a dark blue silk blouse; and in the streets, on cold days, a short
                  jacket of astrachan fur. He wore, also, a pair of drawers of blue brocade gathered
                  tightly over his calves and ankles, offering a general sort of suggestion, that he
                  had forgotten his trousers that morning, but that, so gentlemanly were his
                  manners, his friends had forborne to mention the fact to him. His manner was
                  urbane, although quite serious. He spoke French and English fluently. In brief, I
                  doubt if you could have found the equal of this Pagan shopkeeper among the
                  Christian traders of San Francisco.</p>
               <p>There were a few others present,—a judge of the Federal Court, an editor, a high
                  government official, and a prominent merchant. After we had drunk our tea, and
                  tasted a few sweetmeats from a mysterious jar, that looked as if it might contain
                  a preserved mouse among its other nondescript treasures. Hop Sing arose, and,
                  gravely beckoning us to follow him, began to descend to the basement. When we got
                  there, we were amazed at finding it brilliantly lighted, and that a number of
                  chairs were arranged in a half-circle on the asphalt pavement. When he had
                  courteously seated us, he said,—</p>
               <p>"I have invited you to witness a performance which I can at least promise you no
                  other foreigners but yourselves have ever seen. Wang, the court-juggler, arrived
                  here yesterday morning. He has never given a performance outside of the palace
                  before. I have asked him to entertain my friends this evening. He requires no
                  theatre, stage accessories, or any confederate,—nothing more than you see here.
                  Will you be pleased to examine the ground yourselves, gentlemen."</p>
               <p>Of course we examined the premises. It was the ordinary basement or cellar of the
                  San Francisco storehouse, cemented to keep out the damp. We poked our sticks into
                  the pavement, and rapped on the walls, to satisfy our polite<pb n="84-85"
                     xml:id="VAC6648-00000045"/> host—but for no other purpose. We were quite
                  content to be the victims of any clever deception. For myself, I knew I was ready
                  to be deluded to any extent, and, if I had been offered an explanation of what
                  followed, I should have probably declined it.</p>
               <p>Although I am satisfied that Wang's general performance was the first of that kind
                  ever given on American soil, it has, probably, since become so familiar to many of
                  my readers, that I shall not bore them with it here. He began by setting to
                  flight, with the aid of his fan, the usual number of butterflies, made before our
                  eyes of little bits of tissue-paper, and kept them in the air during the remainder
                  of the performance. I have a vivid recollection of the judge trying to catch one
                  that had lit on his knee, and of its evading him with the pertinacity of a living
                  insect. And, even at this time, Wang, still plying his fan, was taking chickens
                  out of hats, making oranges disappear, pulling endless yards of silk from his
                  sleeve, apparently filling the whole area of the basement with goods that appeared
                  mysteriously from the ground, from his own sleeves, from nowhere! He swallowed
                  knives to the ruin of his digestion for years to come; he dislocated every limb of
                  his body; he reclined in the air, apparently upon nothing. But his crowning
                  performance, which I have never yet seen repeated, was the most weird, mysterious,
                  and astounding. It is my apology for this long introduction, my sole excuse for
                  writing this article, and the genesis of this veracious history.</p>
               <p>He cleared the ground of its encumbering articles for a space of about fifteen
                  feet square, and then invited us all to walk forward, and again examine it. We did
                  so gravely. There was nothing but the cemented pavement below to be seen or felt.
                  He then asked for the loan of a handkerchief; and, as I chanced to be nearest him,
                  I offered mine. He took it, and spread it open upon the floor. Over this he spread
                  a large square of silk, and over this, again, a large shawl nearly covering the
                  space he had cleared. He then took a position at one of the points of this
                  rectangle, and began a monotonous chant, rocking his body to and fro in time with
                  the somewhat lugubrious air.</p>
               <p>We sat still and waited. Above the chant we could hear the striking of the city
                  clocks, and the occasional rattle of a cart in the street overhead. The absolute
                  watchfulness and expectation, the dim, mysterious half-light of the cellar falling
                  in a grewsome way upon the misshapen bulk of a Chinese deity in the background, a
                  faint smell of opium-smoke mingling with spice, and the dreadful uncertainty of
                     what<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6648-00000046"/> we were really waiting for, sent
                  an uncomfortable thrill down our backs, and made us look at each other with a
                  forced and unnatural smile. This feeling was heightened when Hop Sing slowly rose,
                  and, without a word, pointed with his finger to the centre of the shawl.</p>
               <p>There was something beneath the shawl. Surely—and something that was not there
                  before; at first a mere suggestion in relief, a faint outline, but growing more
                  and more distinct and visible every moment. The chant still continued; the
                  perspiration began to roll from the singer's face; gradually the hidden object
                  took upon itself a shape and bulk that raised the shawl in its centre some five or
                  six inches. It was now unmistakably the outline of a small but perfect human
                  figure, with extended arms and legs. One or two of us turned pale. There was a
                  feeling of general uneasiness, until the editor broke the silence by a gibe, that,
                  poor as it was, was received with spontaneous enthusiasm. Then the chant suddenly
                  ceased. Wang arose, and with a quick, dexterous movement, stripped both shawl and
                  silk away, and discovered, sleeping peacefully upon my handkerchief, a tiny
                  Chinese baby.</p>
               <p>The applause and uproar which followed this revelation ought to have satisfied
                  Wang, even if his audience was a small one: it was loud enough to awaken the
                  baby,—a pretty little boy about a year old, looking like a Cupid cut out of
                  sandal-wood. He was whisked away almost as mysteriously as he appeared. When Hop
                  Sing returned my handkerchief to me with a bow, I asked if the juggler was the
                  father of the baby. "No sabe!" said the imperturbable Hop Sing, taking refuge in
                  that Spanish form of non-committalism so common in California.</p>
               <p>"But does he have a new baby for every performance?" I asked. "Perhaps: who
                  knows?"—"But what will become of this one?"—"Whatever you choose, gentlemen,"
                  replied Hop Sing with a courteous inclination. "It was born here: you are its
                  godfathers."</p>
               <p>There were two characteristic peculiarities of any Californian assemblage in
                  1856,—it was quick to take a hint, and generous to the point of prodigality in its
                  response to any charitable appeal. No matter how sordid or avaricious the
                  individual, he could not resist the infection of sympathy. I doubled the points of
                  my handkerchief into a bag, dropped a coin into it, and, without a word, passed it
                  to the judge. He quietly added a twenty-dollar gold-piece, and passed it to the
                  next. When it was returned to me, it contained over a hundred dollars. I knotted
                  the money in the handkerchief, and gave it to Hop Sing.</p>
               <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6648-00000047"/>
               <p>"For the baby, from its godfathers."</p>
               <p>"But what name?" said the judge. There was a running fire of "Erebus," "Nox,"
                  "Plutus," "Terra Cotta," "Antæus," &amp;c. Finally the question was referred to
                  our host.</p>
               <p>"Why not keep his own name?" he said quietly,—"Wan Lee." And he did.</p>
               <p>And thus was Wan Lee, on the night of Friday, the 5th of March, 1856, born into
                  this veracious chronicle.</p>
               <p>The last form of "The Northern Star" for the 19th of July, 1865,—the only daily
                  paper published in Klamath County,—had just gone to press; and at three, A.M., I
                  was putting aside my proofs and manuscripts, preparatory to going home, when I
                  discovered a letter lying under some sheets of paper, which I must have
                  overlooked. The envelope was considerably soiled: it had no post-mark; but I had
                  no difficulty in recognizing the hand of my friend Hop Sing. I opened it
                  hurriedly, and read as follows:—</p>
               <q>
                  <floatingText>
                     <body>
                        <div type="letter">
                           <p>"MY DEAR SIR,—I do not know whether the bearer will suit you; but,
                              unless the office of 'devil' in your newspaper is a purely technical
                              one, I think he has all the qualities required. He is very quick,
                              active, and intelligent; understands English better than he speaks it;
                              and makes up for any defect by his habits of observation and
                              imitation. You have only to show him how to do a thing once, and he
                              will repeat it, whether it is an offence or a virtue. But you
                              certainly know him already. You are one of his godfathers; for is he
                              not Wan Lee, the reputed son of Wang the conjurer, to whose
                              performances I had the honor to introduce you? But perhaps you have
                              forgotten it.</p>
                           <p>"I shall send him with a gang of coolies to Stockton, thence by
                              express to your town. If you can use him there, you will do me a
                              favor, and probably save his life, which is at present in great peril
                              from the hands of the younger members of your Christian and
                              highly-civilized race who attend the enlightened schools in San
                              Francisco.</p>
                           <p>"He has acquired some singular habits and customs from his experience
                              of Wang's profession, which he followed for some years,—until he
                              became too large to go in a hat, or be produced from his father's
                              sleeve. The money you left with me has been expended on his education.
                              He has gone through the Tri-literal Classics, but, I think, without
                              much benefit. He knows but little of Confucius, and absolutely nothing
                              of Mencius. Owing to the negligence of his father, he associated,
                              perhaps, too much with American children.</p>
                           <p>"I should have answered your letter before, by post; but I thought
                              that Wan Lee himself would be a better messenger for this.</p>

               <p>And this was the long-delayed answer to my letter to Hop Sing. But where was "the
                  bearer"? How was the letter delivered? I summoned hastily the foreman, printers,
                  and office-boy, but without eliciting any thing. No one<pb n="90-91"
                     xml:id="VAC6648-00000048"/> had seen the letter delivered, nor knew any thing
                  of the bearer. A few days later, I had a visit from my laundry-man, Ah Ri.</p>
               <p>"You wantee debbil? All lightee: me catchee him."</p>
               <p>He returned in a few moments with a bright-looking Chinese boy, about ten years
                  old, with whose appearance and general intelligence I was so greatly impressed,
                  that I engaged him on the spot. When the business was concluded, I asked his
                  name.</p>
               <p>"Wan Lee," said the boy.</p>
               <p>"What! Are you the boy sent out by Hop Sing? What the devil do you mean by not
                  coming here before? and how did you deliver that letter?"</p>
               <p>Wan Lee looked at me, and laughed. "Me pitchee in top side window."</p>
               <p>I did not understand. He looked for a moment perplexed, and then, snatching the
                  letter out of my hand, ran down the stairs. After a moment's pause, to my great
                  astonishment, the letter came flying in the window, circled twice around the room,
                  and then dropped gently, like a bird upon my table. Before I had got over my
                  surprise, Wan Lee re-appeared, smiled, looked at the letter and then at me, said,
                  "So, John," and then remained gravely silent. I said nothing further; but it was
                  understood that this was his first official act.</p>
               <p>His next performance, I grieve to say, was not attended with equal success. One of
                  our regular paper-carriers fell sick, and, at a pinch, Wan Lee was ordered to fill
                  his place. To prevent mistakes, he was shown over the route the previous evening,
                  and supplied at about daylight with the usual number of subscribers' copies. He
                  returned, after an hour, in good spirits, and without the papers. He had delivered
                  them all, he said.</p>
               <p>Unfortunately for Wan Lee, at about eight o'clock, indignant subscribers began to
                  arrive at the office. They had received their copies; but how? In the form of
                  hard-pressed cannon-balls, delivered by a single shot, and a mere <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">tour de force</foreign>, through the glass of bedroom-windows.
                  They had received them full in the face, like a base ball, if they happened to be
                  up and stirring; they had received them in quarter-sheets, tucked in at separate
                  windows; they had found them in the chimney, pinned against the door, shot through
                  attic-windows, delivered in long slips through convenient keyholes, stuffed into
                  ventilators, and occupying the same can with the morning's milk. One subscriber,
                  who waited for some time at the office-door to have a personal interview with Wan
                  Lee (then comfortably locked in my bedroom), told me, with tears of rage in his
                  eyes, that he had been awakened<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6648-00000049"/> at five
                  o'clock by a most hideous yelling below his windows; that, on rising in great
                  agitation, he was startled by the sudden appearance of "The Northern Star," rolled
                  hard, and bent into the form of a boomerang, or East-Indian club, that sailed into
                  the window, described a number of fiendish circles in the room, knocked over the
                  light, slapped the baby's face, "took" him (the subscriber) "in the jaw," and then
                  returned out of the window, and dropped helplessly in the area. During the rest of
                  the day, wads and strips of soiled paper, purporting to be copies of "The Northern
                  Star" of that morning's issue, were brought indignantly to the office. An
                  admirable editorial on "The Resources of Humboldt County," which I had constructed
                  the evening before, and which, I had reason to believe, might have changed the
                  whole balance of trade during the ensuing year, and left San Francisco bankrupt at
                  her wharves, was in this way lost to the public.</p>
               <p>It was deemed advisable for the next three weeks to keep Wan Lee closely confined
                  to the printing-office, and the purely mechanical part of the business. Here he
                  developed a surprising quickness and adaptability, winning even the favor and good
                  will of the printers and foreman, who at first looked upon his introduction into
                  the secrets of their trade as fraught with the gravest political significance. He
                  learned to set type readily and neatly, his wonderful skill in manipulation aiding
                  him in the mere mechanical act, and his ignorance of the language confining him
                  simply to the mechanical effort, confirming the printer's axiom, that the printer
                  who considers or follows the ideas of his copy makes a poor compositor. He would
                  set up deliberately long diatribes against himself, composed by his
                  fellow-printers, and hung on his hook as copy, and even such short sentences as
                  "Wan Lee is the devil's own imp," "Wan Lee is a Mongolian rascal," and bring the
                  proof to me with happiness beaming from every tooth, and satisfaction shining in
                  his huckleberry eyes.</p>
               <p>It was not long, however, before he learned to retaliate on his mischievous
                  persecutors. I remember one instance in which his reprisal came very near
                  involving me in a serious misunderstanding. Our foreman's name was Webster; and
                  Wan Lee presently learned to know and recognize the individual and combined
                  letters of his name. It was during a political campaign; and the eloquent and
                  fiery Col. Starbottle of Siskyou had delivered an effective speech, which was
                  reported especially for "The Northern Star." In a very sublime peroration, Col.
                  Starbottle had said, "In the language of the godlike Webster, I repeat"—and here
                     followed<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6648-00000050"/> the quotation, which I have
                  forgotten. Now, it chanced that Wan Lee, looking over the galley after it had been
                  revised, saw the name of his chief persecutor, and, of course, imagined the
                  quotation his. After the form was locked up, Wan Lee took advantage of Webster's
                  absence to remove the quotation, and substitute a thin piece of lead, of the same
                  size as the type, engraved with Chinese characters, making a sentence, which, I
                  had reason to believe, was an utter and abject confession of the incapacity and
                  offensiveness of the Webster family generally, and exceedingly eulogistic of Wan
                  Lee himself personally.</p>
               <p>The next morning's paper contained Col. Starbottle's speech in full, in which it
                  appeared that the "godlike" Webster had, on one occasion, uttered his thoughts in
                  excellent but perfectly enigmatical Chinese. The rage of Col. Starbottle knew no
                  bounds. I have a vivid recollection of that admirable man walking into my office,
                  and demanding a retraction of the statement.</p>
               <p>"But my dear sir," I asked, "are you willing to deny, over your own signature,
                  that Webster ever uttered such a sentence? Dare you deny, that, with Mr. Webster's
                  well-known attainments, a knowledge of Chinese might not have been among the
                  number? Are you willing to submit a translation suitable to the capacity of our
                  readers, and deny, upon your honor as a gentleman, that the late Mr. Webster ever
                  uttered such a sentiment? If you are, sir, I am willing to publish your
                  denial."</p>
               <p>The colonel was not, and left, highly indignant.</p>
               <p>Webster, the foreman, took it more coolly. Happily, he was unaware, that, for two
                  days after, Chinamen from the laundries, from the gulches, from the kitchens,
                  looked in the front office-door, with faces beaming with sardonic delight; that
                  three hundred extra copies of the "Star" were ordered for the wash-houses on the
                  river. He only knew, that, during the day, Wan Lee occasionally went off into
                  convulsive spasms, and that he was obliged to kick him into consciousness again. A
                  week after the occurrence, I called Wan Lee into my office.</p>
               <p>"Wan," I said gravely, "I should like you to give me, for my own personal
                  satisfaction, a translation of that Chinese sentence which my gifted countryman,
                  the late godlike Webster, uttered upon a public occasion." Wan Lee looked at me
                  intently, and then the slightest possible twinkle crept into his black eyes. Then
                  he replied with equal gravity,—</p>
               <p>"Mishtel Webstel, he say, 'China boy makee me belly much foolee. China boy makee
                     me<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6648-00000051"/> heap sick.'" Which I have reason to
                  think was true.</p>
               <p>But I fear I am giving but one side, and not the best, of Wan Lee's character. As
                  he imparted it to me, his had been a hard life. He had known scarcely any
                  childhood: he had no recollection of a father or mother. The conjurer Wang had
                  brought him up. He had spent the first seven years of his life in appearing from
                  baskets, in dropping out of hats, in climbing ladders, in putting his little limbs
                  out of joint in posturing. He had lived in an atmosphere of trickery and
                  deception. He had learned to look upon mankind as dupes of their senses: in fine,
                  if he had thought at all, he would have been a sceptic; if he had been a little
                  older, he would have been a cynic; if he had been older still, he would have been
                  a philosopher. As it was, he was a little imp. A good-natured imp it was, too,—an
                  imp whose moral nature had never been awakened,—an imp up for a holiday, and
                  willing to try virtue as a diversion. I don't know that he had any spiritual
                  nature. He was very superstitious. He carried about with him a hideous little
                  porcelain god, which he was in the habit of alternately reviling and propitiating.
                  He was too intelligent for the commoner Chinese vices of stealing or gratuitous
                  lying. Whatever discipline he practised was taught by his intellect.</p>
               <p>I am inclined to think that his feelings were not altogether unimpressible,
                  although it was almost impossible to extract an expression from him; and I
                  conscientiously believe he became attached to those that were good to him. What he
                  might have become under more favorable conditions than the bondsman of an
                  overworked, under-paid literary man, I don't know: I only know that the scant,
                  irregular, impulsive kindnesses that I showed him were gratefully received. He was
                  very loyal and patient, two qualities rare in the average American servant. He was
                  like Malvolio, "sad and civil" with me. Only once, and then under great
                  provocation, do I remember of his exhibiting any impatience. It was my habit,
                  after leaving the office at night, to take him with me to my rooms, as the bearer
                  of any supplemental or happy after-thought, in the editorial way, that might occur
                  to me before the paper went to press. One night I had been scribbling away past
                  the usual hour of dismissing Wan Lee, and had become quite oblivious of his
                  presence in a chair near my door, when suddenly I became aware of a voice saying
                  in plaintive accents, something that sounded like "Chy Lee."</p>
               <p>I faced around sternly.</p>
               <p>"What did you say?"</p>
               <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6648-00000052"/>
               <p>"Me say, 'Chy Lee.'"</p>
               <p>"Well?" I said impatiently.</p>
               <p>"You sabe, 'How do, John?'"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"You sabe, 'So long, John'?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Well, 'Chy Lee' allee same!"</p>
               <p>I understood him quite plainly. It appeared that "Chy Lee" was a form of
                  "good-night," and that Wan Lee was anxious to go home. But an instinct of
                  mischief, which, I fear, I possessed in common with him, impelled me to act as if
                  oblivious of the hint. I muttered something about not understanding him, and again
                  bent over my work. In a few minutes I heard his wooden shoes pattering
                  pathetically over the floor. I looked up. He was standing near the door.</p>
               <p>"You no sabe, 'Chy Lee'?"</p>
               <p>"No," I said sternly.</p>
               <p>"You sabe muchee big foolee! allee same!"</p>
               <p>And, with this audacity upon his lips, he fled. The next morning, however, he was
                  as meek and patient as before, and I did not recall his offence. As a probable
                  peace-offering, he blacked all my boots,—a duty never required of him,—including a
                  pair of buff deer-skin slippers and an immense pair of horseman's jack-boots, on
                  which he indulged his remorse for two hours.</p>
               <p>I have spoken of his honesty as being a quality of his intellect rather than his
                  principle; but I recall about this time two exceptions to the rule. I was anxious
                  to get some fresh eggs as a change to the heavy diet of a mining-town; and,
                  knowing that Wan Lee's countrymen were great poultry-raisers, I applied to him. He
                  furnished me with them regularly every morning, but refused to take any pay,
                  saying that the man did not sell them,—a remarkable instance of self-abnegation,
                  as eggs were then worth half a dollar apiece. One morning my neighbor Forster
                  dropped in upon me at breakfast, and took occasion to bewail his own ill fortune,
                  as his hens had lately stopped laying, or wandered off in the bush. Wan Lee, who
                  was present during our colloquy, preserved his characteristic sad taciturnity.
                  When my neighbor had gone, he turned to me with a slight chuckle: "Flostel's
                  hens—Wan Lee's hens allee same!" His other offence was more serious and ambitious.
                  It was a season of great irregularities in the mails, and Wan Lee had heard me
                  deplore the delay in the delivery of my letters and newspapers. On arriving at my
                  office one day, I was amazed to find my table covered with letters, evidently just
                  from the post-office, but, unfortunately, not one addressed to me. I turned to Wan
                     Lee,<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6648-00000053"/> who was surveying them with a
                  calm satisfaction, and demanded an explanation. To my horror he pointed to an
                  empty mail-bag in the corner, and said, "Postman he say, 'No lettee, John; no
                  lettee, John.' Postman plentee lie! Postman no good. Me catchee lettee last night
                  allee same!" Luckily it was still early: the mails had not been distributed. I had
                  a hurried interview with the postmaster; and Wan Lee's bold attempt at robbing the
                  United States mail was finally condoned by the purchase of a new mail-bag, and the
                  whole affair thus kept a secret.</p>
               <p>If my liking for my little Pagan page had not been sufficient, my duty to Hop Sing
                  was enough, to cause me to take Wan Lee with me when I returned to San Francisco
                  after my two years' experience with "The Northern Star." I do not think he
                  contemplated the change with pleasure. I attributed his feelings to a nervous
                  dread of crowded public streets (when he had to go across town for me on an
                  errand, he always made a circuit of the outskirts), to his dislike for the
                  discipline of the Chinese and English school to which I proposed to send him, to
                  his fondness for the free, vagrant life of the mines, to sheer wilfulness. That it
                  might have been a superstitious premonition did not occur to me until long
                  after.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless it really seemed as if the opportunity I had long looked for and
                  confidently expected had come,—the opportunity of placing Wan Lee under gently
                  restraining influences, of subjecting him to a life and experience that would draw
                  out of him what good my superficial care and ill-regulated kindness could not
                  reach. Wan Lee was placed at the school of a Chinese missionary,—an intelligent
                  and kind-hearted clergyman, who had shown great interest in the boy, and who,
                  better than all, had a wonderful faith in him. A home was found for him in the
                  family of a widow, who had a bright and interesting daughter about two years
                  younger than Wan Lee. It was this bright, cheery, innocent, and artless child that
                  touched and reached a depth in the boy's nature that hitherto had been
                  unsuspected; that awakened a moral susceptibility which had lain for years
                  insensible alike to the teachings of society, or the ethics of the theologian.</p>
               <p>These few brief months—bright with a promise that we never saw fulfilled—must have
                  been happy ones to Wan Lee. He worshipped his little friend with something of the
                  same superstition, but without any of the caprice, that he bestowed upon his
                  porcelain Pagan god. It was his delight to walk behind her to school, carrying her
                  books,—a service always fraught<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6648-00000054"/> with
                  danger to him from the little hands of his Caucasian Christian brothers. He made
                  her the most marvellous toys; he would cut out of carrots and turnips the most
                  astonishing roses and tulips; he made life-like chickens out of melon-seeds; he
                  constructed fans and kites, and was singularly proficient in the making of dolls'
                  paper dresses. On the other hand, she played and sang to him, taught him a
                  thousand little prettinesses and refinements only known to girls, gave him a
                  yellow ribbon for his pig-tail, as best suiting his complexion, read to him,
                  showed him wherein he was original and valuable, took him to Sunday school with
                  her, against the precedents of the school, and, small-woman-like, triumphed. I
                  wish I could add here, that she effected his conversion, and made him give up his
                  porcelain idol. But I am telling a true story; and this little girl was quite
                  content to fill him with her own Christian goodness, without letting him know that
                  he was changed. So they got along very well together,—this little Christian girl
                  with her shining cross hanging around her plump, white little neck; and this dark
                  little Pagan, with his hideous porcelain god hidden away in his blouse.</p>
               <p>There were two days of that eventful year which will long be remembered in San
                  Francisco,—two days when a mob of her citizens set upon and killed unarmed,
                  defenceless foreigners because they were foreigners, and of another race,
                  religion, and color, and worked for what wages they could get. There were some
                  public men so timid, that seeing this, they thought that the end of the world had
                  come. There were some eminent statesmen, whose names I am ashamed to write here,
                  who began to think that the passage in the Constitution which guarantees civil and
                  religious liberty to every citizen or foreigner was a mistake. But there were,
                  also, some men who were not so easily frightened; and in twenty-four hours we had
                  things so arranged, that the timid men could wring their hands in safety, and the
                  eminent statesmen utter their doubts without hurting any body or any thing. And in
                  the midst of this I got a note from Hop Sing, asking me to come to him
                  immediately.</p>
               <p>I found his warehouse closed, and strongly guarded by the police against any
                  possible attack of the rioters. Hop Sing admitted me through a barred grating with
                  his usual imperturbable calm, but, as it seemed to me, with more than his usual
                  seriousness. Without a word, he took my hand, and led me to the rear of the room,
                  and thence down stairs into the basement. It was dimly lighted; but there was
                  something lying on the floor covered by a shawl.<pb n="104-105"
                     xml:id="VAC6648-00000055"/> As I approached he drew the shawl away with a
                  sudden gesture, and revealed Wan Lee, the Pagan, lying there dead.</p>
               <p>Dead, my reverend friends, dead,—stoned to death in the streets of San Francisco,
                  in the year of grace 1869, by a mob of half-grown boys and Christian
                  school-children!</p>
               <p>As I put my hand reverently upon his breast, I felt something crumbling beneath
                  his blouse. I looked inquiringly at Hop Sing. He put his hand between the folds of
                  silk, and drew out something with the first bitter smile I had ever seen on the
                  face of that Pagan gentleman.</p>
               <p>It was Wan Lee's porcelain god, crushed by a stone from the hands of those
                  Christian iconoclasts!</p>

               <head>HOW OLD MAN PLUNKETT WENT HOME.</head>
               <p>I THINK we all loved him. Even after he mismanaged the affairs of the Amity Ditch
                  Company, we commiserated him, although most of us were stockholders, and lost
                  heavily. I remember that the blacksmith went so far as to say that "them chaps as
                  put that responsibility on the old man oughter be lynched." But the blacksmith was
                  not a stockholder; and the expression was looked upon as the excusable
                  extravagance of a large, sympathizing nature, that, when combined with a powerful
                  frame, was unworthy of notice. At least, that was the way they put it. Yet I think
                  there was a general feeling of regret that this misfortune would interfere with
                  the old man's long-cherished plan of "going home."</p>
               <p>Indeed, for the last ten years he had been "going home." He was going home after a
                  six-months sojourn at Monte Flat; he was going home after the first rains; he was
                  going home<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6648-00000056"/> when the rains were over; he
                  was going home when he had cut the timber on Buckeye Hill, when there was pasture
                  on Dow's Flat, when he struck pay-dirt on Eureka Hill, when the Amity Company paid
                  its first dividend, when the election was over, when he had received an answer
                  from his wife. And so the years rolled by, the spring rains came and went, the
                  woods of Buckeye Hill were level with the ground, the pasture on Dow's Flat grew
                  sear and dry, Eureka Hill yielded its pay-dirt and swamped its owner, the first
                  dividends of the Amity Company were made from the assessments of stockholders,
                  there were new county officers at Monte Flat, his wife's answer had changed into a
                  persistent question, and still old man Plunkett remained.</p>
               <p>It is only fair to say that he had made several distinct essays toward going. Five
                  years before, he had bidden good-by to Monte Hill with much effusion and
                  hand-shaking. But he never got any farther than the next town. Here he was induced
                  to trade the sorrel colt he was riding for a bay mare,—a transaction that at once
                  opened to his lively fancy a vista of vast and successful future speculation. A
                  few days after, Abner Dean of Angel's received a letter from him, stating that he
                  was going to Visalia to buy horses. "I am satisfied," wrote Plunkett, with that
                  elevated rhetoric for which his correspondence spondence was remarkable,—"I am
                  satisfied that we are at last developing the real resources of California. The
                  world will yet look to Dow's Flat as the great stock-raising centre. In view of
                  the interests involved, I have deferred my departure for a month." It was two
                  before he again returned to us—penniless. Six months later, he was again enabled
                  to start for the Eastern States; and this time he got as far as San Francisco. I
                  have before me a letter which I received a few days after his arrival, from which
                  I venture to give an extract: "You know, my dear boy, that I have always believed
                  that gambling, as it is absurdly called, is still in its infancy in California. I
                  have always maintained that a perfect system might be invented, by which the game
                  of poker may be made to yield a certain percentage to the intelligent player. I am
                  not at liberty at present to disclose the system; but before leaving this city I
                  intend to perfect it." He seems to have done so, and returned to Monte Flat with
                  two dollars and thirty-seven cents, the absolute remainder of his capital after
                  such perfection.</p>
               <p>It was not until 1868 that he appeared to have finally succeeded in going home. He
                  left us by the overland route,—a route which he declared would give great
                  opportunity for the discovery of undeveloped resources. His last<pb n="108-109"
                     xml:id="VAC6648-00000057"/> letter was dated Virginia City. He was absent three
                  years. At the close of a very hot day in midsummer, he alighted from the Wingdam
                  stage, with hair and beard powdered with dust and age. There was a certain shyness
                  about his greeting, quite different from his usual frank volubility, that did not,
                  however, impress us as any accession of character. For some days he was reserved
                  regarding his recent visit, contenting himself with asserting, with more or less
                  aggressiveness, that he had "always said he was going home, and now he had been
                  there." Later he grew more communicative, and spoke freely and critically of the
                  manners and customs of New York and Boston, commented on the social changes in the
                  years of his absence, and, I remember, was very hard upon what he deemed the
                  follies incidental to a high state of civilization. Still later he darkly alluded
                  to the moral laxity of the higher planes of Eastern society; but it was not long
                  before he completely tore away the veil, and revealed the naked wickedness of New
                  York social life in a way I even now shudder to recall. Vinous intoxication, it
                  appeared, was a common habit of the first ladies of the city. Immoralities which
                  he scarcely dared name were daily practised by the refined of both sexes.
                  Niggardliness and greed were the common vices of the rich. "I have always
                  asserted," he continued, "that corruption must exist where luxury and riches are
                  rampant, and capital is not used to develop the natural resources of the country.
                  Thank you—I will take mine without sugar." It is possible that some of these
                  painful details crept into the local journals. I remember an editorial in "The
                  Monte Flat Monitor," entitled "The Effete East," in which the fatal decadence of
                  New York and New England was elaborately stated, and California offered as a means
                  of natural salvation. "Perhaps," said "The Monitor," "we might add that Calaveras
                  County offers superior inducements to the Eastern visitor with capital."</p>
               <p>Later he spoke of his family. The daughter he had left a child had grown into
                  beautiful womanhood. The son was already taller and larger than his father; and,
                  in a playful trial of strength, "the young rascal," added Plunkett, with a voice
                  broken with paternal pride and humorous objurgation, had twice thrown his doting
                  parent to the ground. But it was of his daughter he chiefly spoke. Perhaps
                  emboldened by the evident interest which masculine Monte Flat held in feminine
                  beauty, he expatiated at some length on her various charms and accomplishments,
                  and finally produced her photograph,—that of a very pretty girl,—to their infinite
                  peril. But his account of his first meeting with<pb n="110-111"
                     xml:id="VAC6648-00000058"/> her was so peculiar, that I must fain give it after
                  his own methods, which were, perhaps, some shades less precise and elegant than
                  his written style.</p>
               <p>"You see, boys, it's always been my opinion that a man oughter be able to tell his
                  own flesh and blood by instinct. It's ten years since I'd seen my Melindy; and she
                  was then only seven, and about so high. So, when I went to New York, what did I
                  do? Did I go straight to my house, and ask for my wife and daughter, like other
                  folks? No, sir! I rigged myself up as a peddler, as a peddler, sir; and I rung the
                  bell. When the servant came to the door, I wanted—don't you see?—to show the
                  ladies some trinkets. Then there was a voice over the banister says, 'Don't want
                  any thing: send him away.'—'Some nice laces, ma'am, smuggled,' I says, looking up.
                  'Get out, you wretch!' says she. I knew the voice, boys: it was my wife, sure as a
                  gun. Thar wasn't any instinct thar. 'Maybe the young ladies want somethin',' I
                  said. 'Did you hear me?' says she; and with that she jumps forward, and I left.
                  It's ten years, boys, since I've seen the old woman; but somehow, when she fetched
                  that leap, I naterally left."</p>
               <p>He had been standing beside the bar—his usual attitude—when he made this speech;
                  but at this point he half faced his auditors with a look that was very effective.
                  Indeed, a few who had exhibited some signs of scepticism and lack of interest, at
                  once assumed an appearance of intense gratification and curiosity as he went
                  on,—</p>
               <p>"Well, by hangin round there for a day or two, I found out at last it was to be
                  Melindy's birthday next week, and that she was goin' to have a big party. I tell
                  ye what, boys, it weren't no slouch of a reception. The whole house was bloomin'
                  with flowers, and blazin' with lights; and there was no end of servants and plate
                  and refreshments and fixin's"—</p>
               <p>"Uncle Joe."</p>
               <p>"Well?"</p>
               <p>"Where did they get the money?"</p>
               <p>Plunkett faced his interlocutor with a severe glance. "I always said," he replied
                  slowly, "that, when I went home, I'd send on ahead of me a draft for ten thousand
                  dollars. I always said that, didn't I? Eh? And I said I was goin' home—and I've
                  been home, haven't I? Well?"</p>
               <p>Either there was something irresistibly conclusive in this logic, or else the
                  desire to hear the remainder of Plunkett's story was stronger; but there was no
                  more interruption. His ready good-humor quickly returned, and, with a slight
                  chuckle, he went on,—</p>
               <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6648-00000059"/>
               <p>"I went to the biggest jewelry shop in town, and I bought a pair of diamond
                  ear-rings, and put them in my pocket, and went to the house. 'What name?' says the
                  chap who opened the door; and he looked like a cross 'twixt a restaurant waiter
                  and a parson. 'Skeesicks,' said I. He takes me in; and pretty soon my wife comes
                  sailin' into the parlor, and says, 'Excuse me; but I don't think I recognize the
                  name.' She was mighty polite; for I had on a red wig and side-whiskers. 'A friend
                  of your husband's from California, ma'am, with a present for your daughter,
                  Miss—,' and I made as I had forgot the name. But all of a sudden a voice said,
                  'That's too thin;' and in walked Melindy. 'It's playin' it rather low down,
                  father, to pretend you don't know your daughter's name; ain't it, now? How are
                  you, old man?' And with that she tears off my wig and whiskers, and throws her
                  arms around my neck—instinct, sir, pure instinct!"</p>
               <p>Emboldened by the laughter which followed his description of the filial utterances
                  of Melinda, he again repeated her speech, with more or less elaboration, joining
                  in with, and indeed often leading, the hilarity that accompanied it, and returning
                  to it, with more or less incoherency, several times during the evening.</p>
               <p>And so, at various times and at various places, but chiefly in bar-rooms, did this
                  Ulysses of Monte Flat recount the story of his wanderings. There were several
                  discrepancies in his statement; there was sometimes considerable prolixity of
                  detail; there was occasional change of character and scenery; there was once or
                  twice an absolute change in the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">denoûment</foreign>: but
                  always the fact of his having visited his wife and children remained. Of course,
                  in a sceptical community like that of Monte Flat,—a community accustomed to great
                  expectation and small realization,—a community wherein, to use the local dialect,
                  "they got the color, and struck hardpan," more frequently than any other
                  mining-camp,—in such a community, the fullest credence was not given to old man
                  Plunkett's facts. There was only one exception to the general unbelief,—Henry York
                  of Sandy Bar. It was he who was always an attentive listener; it was his scant
                  purse that had often furnished Plunkett with means to pursue his unprofitable
                  speculations; it was to him that the charms of Melinda were more frequently
                  rehearsed; it was he that had borrowed her photograph; and it was he that, sitting
                  alone in his little cabin one night, kissed that photograph, until his honest,
                  handsome face glowed again in the firelight.</p>
               <p>It was dusty in Monte Flat. The ruins of<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6648-00000060"
                  /> the long dry season were crumbling everywhere: everywhere the dying summer had
                  strewn its red ashes a foot deep, or exhaled its last breath in a red cloud above
                  the troubled highways. The alders and cottonwoods, that marked the line of the
                  water-courses, were grimy with dust, and looked as if they might have taken root
                  in the open air. The gleaming stones of the parched water-courses themselves were
                  as dry bones in the valley of death. The dusty sunset at times painted the flanks
                  of the distant hills a dull, coppery hue: on other days, there was an odd,
                  indefinable earthquake halo on the volcanic cones of the farther coast-spurs.
                  Again an acrid, resinous smoke from the burning wood on Heavytree Hill smarted the
                  eyes, and choked the free breath of Monte Flat; or a fierce wind, driving every
                  thing, including the shrivelled summer, like a curled leaf before it, swept down
                  the flanks of the Sierras, and chased the inhabitants to the doors of their
                  cabins, and shook its red fist in at their windows. And on such a night as this,
                  the dust having in some way choked the wheels of material progress in Monte Flat,
                  most of the inhabitants were gathered listlessly in the gilded bar-room of the
                  Moquelumne Hotel, spitting silently at the red-hot stove that tempered the
                  mountain winds to the shorn lambs of Monte Flat, and waiting for the rain.</p>
               <p>Every method known to the Flat of beguiling the time until the advent of this
                  long-looked-for phenomenon had been tried. It is true, the methods were not many,
                  being limited chiefly to that form of popular facetiæ known as practical joking;
                  and even this had assumed the seriousness of a business-pursuit. Tommy Roy, who
                  had spent two hours in digging a ditch in front of his own door, into which a few
                  friends casually dropped during the evening, looked <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >ennuyé</foreign> and dissatisfied. The four prominent citizens, who, disguised
                  as foot-pads, had stopped the county treasurer on the Wingdam road, were jaded
                  from their playful efforts next morning. The principal physician and lawyer of
                  Monte Flat, who had entered into an unhallowed conspiracy to compel the sheriff of
                  Calaveras and his <foreign xml:lang="LAT">posse</foreign> to serve a writ of
                  ejectment on a grizzly bear, feebly disguised under the name of one "Major Ursus,"
                  who haunted the groves of Heavytree Hill, wore an expression of resigned
                  weariness. Even the editor of "The Monte Flat Monitor," who had that morning
                  written a glowing account of a battle with the Wipneck Indians, for the benefit of
                  Eastern readers,—even <emph>he</emph> looked grave and worn. When, at last, Abner
                  Dean of Angel's, who had been on a visit to San Francisco, walked into the room,
                  he was, of course, victimized<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6648-00000061"/> timized
                  in the usual way by one or two apparently honest questions, which ended in his
                  answering them, and then falling into the trap of asking another, to his utter and
                  complete shame and mortification; but that was all. Nobody laughed; and Abner,
                  although a victim, did not lose his good-humor. He turned quietly on his
                  tormentors, and said,—</p>
               <p>"I've got something better than that—you know old man Plunkett?"</p>
               <p>Everybody simultaneously spat at the stove, and nodded his head.</p>
               <p>"You know he went home three years ago?" Two or three changed the position of
                  their legs from the backs of different chairs; and one man said, "Yes."</p>
               <p>"Had a good time, home?"</p>
               <p>Everybody looked cautiously at the man who had said, "Yes;" and he, accepting the
                  responsibility with a faint-hearted smile, said, "Yes," again, and breathed hard.
                  "Saw his wife and child—purty gal?" said Abner cautiously. "Yes," answered the man
                  doggedly. "Saw her photograph, perhaps?" continued Abner Dean quietly.</p>
               <p>The man looked hopelessly around for support. Two or three, who had been sitting
                  near him, and evidently encouraging him with a look of interest, now shamelessly
                  abandoned him, and looked another way. Henry York flushed a little, and veiled his
                  gray eyes. The man hesitated, and then with a sickly smile, that was intended to
                  convey the fact that he was perfectly aware of the object of this questioning, and
                  was only humoring it from abstract good feeling, returned, "Yes," again.</p>
               <p>"Sent home—let's see—ten thousand dollars, wasn't it?" Abner Dean went on. "Yes,"
                  reiterated the man with the same smile.</p>
               <p>"Well, I thought so," said Abner quietly. "But the fact is, you see, that he never
                  went home at all—nary time."</p>
               <p>Everybody stared at Abner in genuine surprise and interest, as, with provoking
                  calmness and a half-lazy manner, he went on,—</p>
               <p>"You see, thar was a man down in 'Frisco as knowed him, and saw him in Sonora
                  during the whole of that three years. He was herding sheep, or tending cattle, or
                  spekilating all that time, and hadn't a red cent. Well it 'mounts to this,—that
                  'ar Plunkett ain't been east of the Rocky Mountains since '49."</p>
               <p>The laugh which Abner Dean had the right to confidently expect came; but it was
                  bitter and sardonic. I think indignation was apparent in the minds of his hearers.
                  It was felt, for the first time, that there was a limit to practical joking. A
                  deception carried on for a year,<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6648-00000062"/>
                  compromising the sagacity of Monte Flat, was deserving the severest reprobation.
                  Of course, nobody had believed Plunkett; but then the supposition that it might be
                  believed in adjacent camps that they <emph>had</emph> believed him was gall and
                  bitterness. The lawyer thought that an indictment for obtaining money under false
                  pretences might be found. The physician had long suspected him of insanity, and
                  was not certain but that he ought to be confined. The four prominent merchants
                  thought that the business-interests of Monte Flat demanded that something should
                  be done. In the midst of an excited and angry discussion, the door slowly opened,
                  and old man Plunkett staggered into the room.</p>
               <p>He had changed pitifully in the last six months. His hair was a dusty, yellowish
                  gray, like the chemisal on the flanks of Heavytree Hill; his face was waxen white,
                  and blue and puffy under the eyes; his clothes were soiled and shabby, streaked in
                  front with the stains of hurriedly eaten luncheons, and fluffy behind with the
                  wool and hair of hurriedly-extemporized couches. In obedience to that odd law,
                  that, the more seedy and soiled a man's garments become, the less does he seem
                  inclined to part with them, even during that portion of the twenty-four hours when
                  they are deemed less essential, Plunkett's clothes had gradually taken on the
                  appearance of a kind of a bark, or an outgrowth from within, for which their
                  possessor was not entirely responsible. Howbeit, as he entered the room, he
                  attempted to button his coat over a dirty shirt, and passed his fingers, after the
                  manner of some animal, over his cracker-strewn beard, in recognition of a cleanly
                  public sentiment. But, even as he did so, the weak smile faded from his lips; and
                  his hand, after fumbling aimlessly around a button, dropped helplessly at his
                  side. For as he leaned his back against the bar, and faced the group, he, for the
                  first time, became aware that every eye but one was fixed upon him. His quick,
                  nervous apprehension at once leaped to the truth. His miserable secret was out,
                  and abroad in the very air about him. As a last resort, he glanced despairingly at
                  Henry York; but his flushed face was turned toward the windows.</p>
               <p>No word was spoken. As the bar-keeper silently swung a decanter and glass before
                  him, he took a cracker from a dish, and mumbled it with affected unconcern. He
                  lingered over his liquor until its potency stiffened his relaxed sinews, and
                  dulled the nervous edge of his apprehension, and then he suddenly faced around.
                  "It don't look as if we were goin' to hev any<pb n="120-121"
                     xml:id="VAC6648-00000063"/> rain much afore Christmas," he said with defiant
                  ease.</p>
               <p>No one made any reply.</p>
               <p>"Just like this in '52, and again in '60. It's always been my opinion that these
                  dry seasons come reg'lar. I've said it afore. I say it again. It's jist as I said
                  about going home, you know," he added with desperate recklessness.</p>
               <p>"Thar's a man," said Abner Dean lazily, "ez sez you never went home. Thar's a man
                  ez sez you've been three years in Sonora. Thar's a man ez sez you hain't seen your
                  wife and daughter since '49. Thar's a man ez sez you've been playin' this camp for
                  six months."</p>
               <p>There was a dead silence. Then a voice said quite as quietly,—</p>
               <p>"That man lies."</p>
               <p>It was not the old man's voice. Everybody turned as Henry York slowly rose,
                  stretching out his six feet of length, and, brushing away the ashes that had
                  fallen from his pipe upon his breast, deliberately placed himself beside Plunkett,
                  and faced the others.</p>
               <p>"That man ain't here," continued Abner Dean, with listless indifference of voice,
                  and a gentle pre-occupation of manner, as he carelessly allowed his right hand to
                  rest on his hip near his revolver. "That man ain't here; but, if I'm called upon
                  to make good what he says, why, I'm on hand."</p>
               <p>All rose as the two men—perhaps the least externally agitated of them
                  all—approached each other. The lawyer stepped in between them.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps there's some mistake here. York, do you <emph>know</emph> that the old
                  man has been home?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"How do you know it?"</p>
               <p>York turned his clear, honest, frank eyes on his questioner, and without a tremor
                  told the only direct and unmitigated lie of his life. "Because I've seen him
                  there."</p>
               <p>The answer was conclusive. It was known that York had been visiting the East
                  during the old man's absence. The colloquy had diverted attention from Plunkett,
                  who, pale and breathless, was staring at his unexpected deliverer. As he turned
                  again toward his tormentors, there was something in the expression of his eye that
                  caused those that were nearest to him to fall back, and sent a strange,
                  indefinable thrill through the boldest and most reckless. As he made a step
                  forward, the physician, almost unconsciously, raised his hand with a warning
                  gesture; and old man Plunkett, with his eyes fixed upon the red-hot stove, and an
                  odd smile playing about his mouth, began,—</p>
               <p>"Yes—of course you did. Who says you didn't? It ain't no lie. I said I was
                     goin'<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6648-00000064"/> home—and I've been home.
                  Haven't I? My God! I have. Who says I've been lyin'? Who says I'm dreamin'? Is it
                  true—why don't you speak? It is true, after all. You say you saw me there: why
                  don't you speak again? Say, say!—is it true? It's going now. O my God! it's going
                  again. It's going now. Save me!" And with a fierce cry he fell forward in a fit
                  upon the floor.</p>
               <p>When the old man regained his senses, he found himself in York's cabin. A
                  flickering fire of pine-boughs lit up the rude rafters, and fell upon a photograph
                  tastefully framed with fir-cones, and hung above the brush whereon he lay. It was
                  the portrait of a young girl. It was the first object to meet the old man's gaze;
                  and it brought with it a flush of such painful consciousness, that he started, and
                  glanced quickly around. But his eyes only encountered those of York,—clear, gray,
                  critical, and patient,—and they fell again.</p>
               <p>"Tell me, old man," said York not unkindly, but with the same cold, clear tone in
                  his voice that his eye betrayed a moment ago,—"tell me, is <emph>that</emph> a lie
                  too?" and he pointed to the picture.</p>
               <p>The old man closed his eyes, and did not reply. Two hours before, the question
                  would have stung him into some evasion or bravado. But the revelation contained in
                  the question, as well as the tone of York's voice, was to him now, in his pitiable
                  condition, a relief. It was plain, even to his confused brain, that York had lied
                  when he had indorsed his story in the bar-room; it was clear to him now that he
                  had not been home, that he was not, as he had begun to fear, going mad. It was
                  such a relief, that, with characteristic weakness, his former recklessness and
                  extravagance returned. He began to chuckle, finally to laugh uproariously.</p>
               <p>York, with his eyes still fixed on the old man, withdrew the hand with which he
                  had taken his.</p>
               <p>"Didn't we fool 'em nicely; eh, Yorky! He, he! The biggest thing yet ever played
                  in this camp! I always said I'd play 'em all some day, and I have—played 'em for
                  six months. Ain't it rich?—ain't it the richest thing you ever seed? Did you see
                  Abner's face when he spoke 'bout that man as seed me in Sonora? Warn't it good as
                  the minstrels? Oh, it's too much!" and, striking his leg with the palm of his
                  hand, he almost threw himself from the bed in a paroxysm of laughter,—a paroxysm
                  that, nevertheless, appeared to be half real and half affected.</p>
               <p>"Is that photograph hers?" said York in a low voice, after a slight pause.</p>
               <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6648-00000065"/>
               <p>"Hers? No! It's one of the San Francisco actresses. He, he! Don't you see? I
                  bought it for two bits in one of the bookstores. I never thought they'd swaller
                     <emph>that</emph> too; but they did! Oh, but the old man played 'em this time
                  didn't he—eh?" and he peered curiously in York's face.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and he played <emph>me</emph> too," said York, looking steadily in the old
                  man's eye.</p>
               <p>"Yes, of course," interposed Plunkett hastily; "but you know, Yorky, you got out
                  of it well! You've sold 'em too. We've both got 'em on a string now—you and me—got
                  to stick together now. You did it well, Yorky: you did it well. Why, when you said
                  you'd seen me in York City, I'm d——d if I didn't"—</p>
               <p>"Didn't what?" said York gently; for the old man had stopped with a pale face and
                  wandering eye.</p>
               <p>"Eh?"</p>
               <p>"You say when I said I had seen you in New York you thought"—</p>
               <p>"You lie!" said the old man fiercely. "I didn't say I thought any thing. What are
                  you trying to go back on me for, eh?" His hands were trembling as he rose
                  muttering from the bed, and made his way toward the hearth.</p>
               <p>"Gimme some whiskey," he said presently, "and dry up. You oughter treat anyway.
                  Them fellows oughter treated last night. By hookey, I'd made 'em—only I fell
                  sick."</p>
               <p>York placed the liquor and a tin cup on the table beside him, and, going to the
                  door, turned his back upon his guest, and looked out on the night. Although it was
                  clear moonlight, the familiar prospect never to him seemed so dreary. The dead
                  waste of the broad Wingdam highway never seemed so monotonous, so like the days
                  that he had passed, and were to come to him, so like the old man in its suggestion
                  of going sometime, and never getting there. He turned, and going up to Plunkett
                  put his hand upon his shoulder, and said,—</p>
               <p>"I want you to answer one question fairly and squarely."</p>
               <p>The liquor seemed to have warmed the torpid blood in the old man's veins, and
                  softened his acerbity; for the face he turned up to York was mellowed in its
                  rugged outline, and more thoughtful in expression, as he said,—</p>
               <p>"Go on, my boy."</p>
               <p>"Have you a wife and—daughter?"</p>
               <p>"Before God I have!"</p>
               <p>The two men were silent for a moment, both gazing at the fire. Then Plunkett began
                  rubbing his knees slowly.</p>
               <p>"The wife, if it comes to that, ain't much," he began cautiously, "being a little
                  on the<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6648-00000066"/> shoulder, you know, and wantin',
                  so to speak, a liberal California education, which makes, you know, a bad
                  combination. It's always been my opinion, that there ain't any worse. Why, she's
                  as ready with her tongue as Abner Dean is with his revolver, only with the
                  difference that she shoots from principle, as she calls it; and the consequence
                  is, she's always layin' for you. It's the effete East, my boy, that's ruinin' her.
                  It's them ideas she gets in New York and Boston that's made her and me what we
                  are. I don't mind her havin' 'em, if she didn't shoot. But, havin' that
                  propensity, them principles oughtn't to be lying round loose no more'n
                  firearms."</p>
               <p>"But your daughter?" said York.</p>
               <p>The old man's hands went up to his eyes here, and then both hands and head dropped
                  forward on the table. "Don't say any thing 'bout her, my boy, don't ask me now."
                  With one hand concealing his eyes, he fumbled about with the other in his pockets
                  for his handkerchief—but vainly. Perhaps it was owing to this fact, that he
                  repressed his tears; for, when he removed his hand from his eyes, they were quite
                  dry. Then he found his voice.</p>
               <p>"She's a beautiful girl, beautiful, though I say it; and you shall see her, my
                  boy,—you shall see her sure. I've got things about fixed now. I shall have my plan
                  for reducin' ores perfected in a day or two; and I've got proposals from all the
                  smeltin' works here" (here he hastily produced a bundle of papers that fell upon
                  the floor), "and I'm goin' to send for 'em. I've got the papers here as will give
                  me ten thousand dollars clear in the next month," he added, as he strove to
                  collect the valuable documents again. "I'll have 'em here by Christmas, if I live;
                  and you shall eat your Christmas dinner with me, York, my boy,—you shall
                  sure."</p>
               <p>With his tongue now fairly loosened by liquor and the suggestive vastness of his
                  prospects, he rambled on more or less incoherently, elaborating and amplifying his
                  plans, occasionally even speaking of them as already accomplished, until the moon
                  rode high in the heavens, and York led him again to his couch. Here he lay for
                  some time muttering to himself, until at last he sank into a heavy sleep. When
                  York had satisfied himself of the fact, he gently took down the picture and frame,
                  and, going to the hearth, tossed them on the dying embers, and sat down to see
                  them burn.</p>
               <p>The fir-cones leaped instantly into flame; then the features that had entranced
                  San Francisco audiences nightly, flashed up and passed away (as such things are
                  apt to pass); and even the cynical smile on York's lips faded too.<pb n="128-129"
                     xml:id="VAC6648-00000067"/> And then there came a supplemental and unexpected
                  flash as the embers fell together, and by its light York saw a paper upon the
                  floor. It was one that had fallen from the old man's pocket. As he picked it up
                  listlessly, a photograph slipped from its folds. It was the portrait of a young
                  girl; and on its reverse was written in a scrawling hand, "Melinda to father."</p>
               <p>It was at best a cheap picture, but, ah me! I fear even the deft graciousness of
                  the highest art could not have softened the rigid angularities of that youthful
                  figure, its self-complacent vulgarity, its cheap finery, its expressionless
                  ill-favor. York did not look at it a second time. He turned to the letter for
                  relief.</p>
               <p>It was misspelled; it was unpunctuated; it was almost illegible; it was fretful in
                  tone, and selfish in sentiment. It was not, I fear, even original in the story of
                  its woes. It was the harsh recital of poverty, of suspicion, of mean makeshifts
                  and compromises, of low pains and lower longings, of sorrows that were degrading,
                  of a grief that was pitiable. Yet it was sincere in a certain kind of vague
                  yearning for the presence of the degraded man to whom it was written,—an affection
                  that was more like a confused instinct than a sentiment.</p>
               <p>York folded it again carefully, and placed it beneath the old man's pillow. Then
                  he returned turned to his seat by the fire. A smile that had been playing upon his
                  face, deepening the curves behind his mustache, and gradually overrunning his
                  clear gray eyes, presently faded away. It was last to go from his eyes; and it
                  left there, oddly enough to those who did not know him, a tear.</p>
               <p>He sat there for a long time, leaning forward, his head upon his hands. The wind
                  that had been striving with the canvas roof all at once lifted its edges, and a
                  moonbeam slipped suddenly in, and lay for a moment like a shining blade upon his
                  shoulder; and, knighted by its touch, straightway plain Henry York arose,
                  sustained, high-purposed and self-reliant.</p>
               <p>The rains had come at last. There was already a visible greenness on the slopes of
                  Heavy-tree Hill; and the long, white track of the Wingdam road was lost in
                  outlying pools and ponds a hundred rods from Monte Flat. The spent water-courses,
                  whose white bones had been sinuously trailed over the flat, like the vertebræ of
                  some forgotten saurian, were full again; the dry bones moved once more in the
                  valley; and there was joy in the ditches, and a pardonable extravagance in the
                  columns of "The Monte Flat Monitor." "Never before in the history of the county
                  has the yield been so satisfactory. Our<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6648-00000068"/>
                  contemporary of 'The Hillside Beacon,' who yesterday facetiously alluded to the
                  fact (?) that our best citizens were leaving town in 'dugouts,' on account of the
                  flood, will be glad to hear that our distinguished fellow-townsman, Mr. Henry
                  York, now on a visit to his relatives in the East, lately took with him in his
                  'dugout' the modest sum of fifty thousand dollars, the result of one week's
                  clean-up. We can imagine," continued that sprightly journal, "that no such
                  misfortune is likely to overtake Hillside this season. And yet we believe 'The
                  Beacon' man wants a railroad." A few journals broke out into poetry. The operator
                  at Simpson's Crossing telegraphed to "The Sacramento Universe" "All day the low
                  clouds have shook their garnered fulness down." A San-Francisco journal lapsed
                  into noble verse, thinly disguised as editorial prose: "Rejoice: the gentle rain
                  has come, the bright and pearly rain, which scatters blessings on the hills, and
                  sifts them o' er the plain. Rejoice," &amp;c. Indeed, there was only one to whom
                  the rain had not brought blessing, and that was Plunkett. In some mysterious and
                  darksome way, it had interfered with the perfection of his new method of reducing
                  ores, and thrown the advent of that invention back another season. It had brought
                  him down to an habitual seat in the bar-room, where, to heedless and inattentive
                  ears, he sat and discoursed of the East and his family.</p>
               <p>No one disturbed him. Indeed, it was rumored that some funds had been lodged with
                  the landlord, by a person or persons unknown, whereby his few wants were provided
                  for. His mania—for that was the charitable construction which Monte Flat put upon
                  his conduct—was indulged, even to the extent of Monte Flat's accepting his
                  invitation to dine with his family on Christmas Day,—an invitation extended
                  frankly to every one with whom the old man drank or talked. But one day, to
                  everybody's astonishment, he burst into the bar-room, holding an open letter in
                  his hand. It read as follows:—</p>

               </q>
               <p>The letter was handed round in silence. The old man, with a look alternating
                  between hope and fear, gazed in the faces of the group. The doctor looked up
                  significantly, after a pause. "It's a forgery evidently," he said in a low voice.
                  "He's cunning enough to conceive it (they always are); but you'll find he'll fail
                     in<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6648-00000069"/> executing it. Watch his face!—Old
                  man," he said suddenly, in a loud peremptory tone, "this is a trick, a forgery,
                  and you know it. Answer me squarely, and look me in the eye. Isn't it so?"</p>
               <p>The eyes of Plunkett stared a moment, and then dropped weakly. Then, with a
                  feebler smile, he said, "You're too many for me, boys. The Doc's right. The little
                  game's up. You can take the old man's hat;" and so, tottering, trembling, and
                  chuckling, he dropped into silence and his accustomed seat. But the next day he
                  seemed to have forgotten this episode, and talked as glibly as ever of the
                  approaching festivity.</p>
               <p>And so the days and weeks passed until Christmas—a bright, clear day, warmed with
                  south winds, and joyous with the resurrection of springing grasses—broke upon
                  Monte Flat. And then there was a sudden commotion in the hotel bar-room; and Abner
                  Dean stood beside the old man's chair, and shook him out of a slumber to his feet.
                  "Rouse up, old man. York is here, with your wife and daughter, at the cottage on
                  Heavytree. Come, old man. Here, boys, give him a lift;" and in another moment a
                  dozen strong and willing hands had raised the old man, and bore him in triumph to
                  the street, up the steep grade of Heavytree Hill, and deposited posited him,
                  struggling and confused, in the porch of a little cottage. At the same instant two
                  women rushed forward, but were restrained by a gesture from Henry York. The old
                  man was struggling to his feet. With an effort at last, he stood erect, trembling,
                  his eye fixed, a gray pallor on his cheek, and a deep resonance in his voice.</p>
               <p>"It's all a trick, and a lie! They ain't no flesh and blood or kin o' mine. It
                  ain't my wife, nor child. My daughter's a beautiful girl—a beautiful girl, d'ye
                  hear? She's in New York with her mother, and I'm going to fetch her here. I said
                  I'd go home, and I've been home: d'ye hear me?' I've been home! It's a mean trick
                  you're playin' on the old man. Let me go: d'ye hear? Keep them women off me! Let
                  me go! I'm going—I'm going—home!"</p>
               <p>His hands were thrown up convulsively in the air, and, half turning round, he fell
                  sideways on the porch, and so to the ground. They picked him up hurriedly, but too
                  late. He had gone home.</p>

               <head>THE FOOL OF FIVE FORKS.</head>
               <p>HE lived alone. I do not think this peculiarity arose from any wish to withdraw
                  his foolishness from the rest of the camp; nor was it probable that the combined
                  wisdom of Five Forks ever drove him into exile. My impression is, that he lived
                  alone from choice,—a choice he made long before the camp indulged in any criticism
                  of his mental capacity. He was much given to moody reticence, and, although to
                  outward appearances a strong man, was always complaining of ill-health. Indeed,
                  one theory of his isolation was, that it afforded him better opportunities for
                  taking medicine, of which he habitually consumed large quantities.</p>
               <p>His folly first dawned upon Five Forks through the post-office windows. He was,
                  for a long time, the only man who wrote home by every mail; his letters being
                  always directed to the same person,—a woman. Now, it so happened that the bulk of
                  the Five Forks correspondence was usually the other way. There were many letters
                  received (the majority being in the female hand), but very few answered. The men
                  received them indifferently, or as a matter of course. A few opened and read them
                  on the spot, with a barely repressed smile of self-conceit, or quite as frequently
                  glanced over them with undisguised impatience. Some of the letters began with "My
                  dear husband;" and some were never called for. But the fact that the only regular
                  correspondent of Five Forks never received any reply became at last quite
                  notorious. Consequently, when an envelope was received, bearing the stamp of the
                  "dead letter office," addressed to "The Fool," under the more conventional title
                  of "Cyrus Hawkins," there was quite a fever of excitement. I do not know how the
                  secret leaked out; but it was eventually known to the camp, that the envelope
                  contained Hawkins's own letters returned. This was the first evidence of his
                  weakness. Any man who repeatedly wrote to a woman who did not reply must be a
                  fool. I think Hawkins suspected that his folly was known to the camp; but he took
                  refuge in symptoms of chills and fever, which he at once developed, and effected a
                  diversion with three bottles of Indian cholagogue and two boxes of pills. At all
                  events, at the end of a week, he resumed a pen stiffened by tonics, with all his
                  old epistolatory pertinacity. This time the letters had a new address.</p>
               <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6648-00000071"/>
               <p>In those days a popular belief obtained in the mines, that luck particularly
                  favored the foolish and unscientific. Consequently, when Hawkins struck a "pocket"
                  in the hillside near his solitary cabin, there was but little surprise. "He will
                  sink it all in the next hole" was the prevailing belief, predicated upon the usual
                  manner in which the possessor of "nigger luck" disposed of his fortune. To
                  everybody's astonishment, Hawkins, after taking out about eight thousand dollars,
                  and exhausting the pocket, did not prospect for another. The camp then waited
                  patiently to see what he would do with his money. I think, however, that it was
                  with the greatest difficulty their indignation was kept from taking the form of a
                  personal assault when it became known that he had purchased a draft for eight
                  thousand dollars, in favor of "that woman." More than this, it was finally
                  whispered that the draft was returned to him as his letters had been, and that he
                  was ashamed to reclaim the money at the express-office. "It wouldn't be a bad
                  specilation to go East, get some smart gal, for a hundred dollars, to dress
                  herself up and represent that 'Hag,' and jest freeze onto that eight thousand,"
                  suggested a far-seeing financier. I may state here, that we always alluded to
                  Hawkins's fair unknown as the "Hag" without having, I am confident, the least
                  justification for that epithet.</p>
               <p>That the "Fool" should gamble seemed eminently fit and proper. That he should
                  occasionally win a large stake, according to that popular theory which I have
                  recorded in the preceding paragraph, appeared, also, a not improbable or
                  inconsistent fact. That he should, however, break the faro bank which Mr. John
                  Hamlin had set up in Five Forks, and carry off a sum variously estimated at from
                  ten to twenty thousand dollars, and not return the next day, and lose the money at
                  the same table, really appeared incredible. Yet such was the fact. A day or two
                  passed without any known investment of Mr. Hawkins's recently-acquired capital.
                  "Ef he allows to send it to that 'Hag,'" said one prominent citizen, "suthin'
                  ought to be done. It's jest ruinin' the reputation of this yer camp,—this sloshin'
                  around o' capital on non-residents ez don't claim it!" "It's settin' an example o'
                  extravagance," said another, "ez is little better nor a swindle. Thais mor'n five
                  men in this camp, thet, hearin' thet Hawkins hed sent home eight thousand dollars,
                  must jest rise up and send home their hard earnings too! And then to think thet
                  thet eight thousand was only a bluff, after all, and thet it's lyin' there on call
                  in Adams &amp;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6648-00000072"/> Co.'s bank! Well, I say
                  it's one o' them things a vigilance committee oughter look into."</p>
               <p>When there seemed no possibility of this repetition of Hawkins's folly, the
                  anxiety to know what he had really done with his money became intense. At last a
                  self-appointed committee of four citizens dropped artfully, but to outward
                  appearances carelessly, upon him in his seclusion. When some polite formalities
                  had been exchanged, and some easy vituperation of a backward season offered by
                  each of the parties, Tom Wingate approached the subject.</p>
               <p>"Sorter dropped heavy on Jack Hamlin the other night, didn't ye? He allows you
                  didn't give him no show for revenge. I said you wasn't no such d—d fool; didn't I,
                  Dick?" continued the artful Wingate, appealing to a confederate.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Dick promptly. "You said twenty thousand dollars wasn't goin' to be
                  thrown around recklessly. You said Cyrus had suthin' better to do with his
                  capital," super-added Dick with gratuitous mendacity. "I disremember now what
                  partickler investment you said he was goin' to make with it," he continued,
                  appealing with easy indifference to his friend.</p>
               <p>Of course Wingate did not reply, but looked at the "Fool," who, with a troubled
                  face, was rubbing his legs softly. After a pause, he turned deprecatingly toward
                  his visitors.</p>
               <p>"Ye didn't enny of ye ever hev a sort of tremblin' in your legs, a kind o'
                  shakiness from the knee down? Suthin'," he continued, slightly brightening with
                  his topic,—"suthin' that begins like chills, and yet ain't chills? A kind o'
                  sensation of goneness here, and a kind o' feelin' as if you might die
                  suddint?—when Wright's Pills don't somehow reach the spot, and quinine don't fetch
                  you?"</p>
               <p>"No!" said Wingate with a curt directness, and the air of authoritatively
                  responding for his friends,—"no, never had. You was speakin' of this yer
                  investment."</p>
               <p>"And your bowels all the time irregular?" continued Hawkins, blushing under
                  Wingate's eye, and yet clinging despairingly to his theme, like a shipwrecked
                  mariner to his plank.</p>
               <p>Wingate did not reply, but glanced significantly at the rest. Hawkins evidently
                  saw this recognition of his mental deficiency, and said apologetically, "You was
                  saying suthin' about my investment?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Wingate, so rapidly as to almost take Hawkins's breath away,—"the
                  investment you made in"—</p>
               <p>"Rafferty's Ditch," said the "Fool" timidly. </p>
               <p>For a moment, the visitors could only stare<pb n="140-141"
                     xml:id="VAC6648-00000073"/> blankly at each other. "Rafferty's Ditch," the one

                  could not be got to a place where it wasn't wanted!—Rafferty's Ditch, that had
                  buried the fortunes of Rafferty and twenty wretched stockholders in its muddy
                  depths!</p>
               <p>"And thet's it, is it?" said Wingate, after a gloomy pause. "Thet's it! I see it
                  all now, boys. That's how ragged Pat Rafferty went down to San Francisco yesterday
                  in store-clothes, and his wife and four children went off in a kerridge to
                  Sacramento. Thet's why them ten workmen of his, ez hadn't a cent to bless
                  themselves with, was playin' billiards last night, and eatin' isters. Thet's whar
                  that money kum frum,—one hundred dollars to pay for the long advertisement of the
                  new issue of ditch stock in the "Times" yesterday. Thet's why them six strangers
                  were booked at the Magnolia Hotel yesterday. Don't you see? It's thet money—and
                  that 'Fool'!"</p>
               <p>The "Fool" sat silent. The visitors rose without a word.</p>
               <p>"You never took any of them Indian Vegetable Pills?" asked Hawkins timidly of
                  Wingate.</p>
               <p>"No!" roared Wingate as he opened the door.</p>
               <p>"They tell me, that, took with the Panacea,—they was out o' the Panacea when I
                  went to the drug-store last week,—they say, that, took with the Panacea, they
                  always effect a certin cure." But by this time, Wingate and his disgusted friends
                  had retreated, slamming the door on the "Fool" and his ailments.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, in six months the whole affair was forgotten: the money had been
                  spent; the "Ditch" had been purchased by a company of Boston capitalists, fired by
                  the glowing description of an Eastern tourist, who had spent one drunken night at
                  Five Forks; and I think even the mental condition of Hawkins might have remained
                  undisturbed by criticism, but for a singular incident.</p>
               <p>It was during an exciting political campaign, when party-feeling ran high, that
                  the irascible Capt. McFadden of Sacramento visited Five Forks. During a heated
                  discussion in the Prairie Rose Saloon, words passed between the captain and the
                  Hon. Calhoun Bungstarter, ending in a challenge. The captain bore the infelicitous
                  reputation of being a notorious duellist and a dead-shot. The captain was
                  unpopular. The captain was believed to have been sent by the opposition for a
                  deadly purpose; and the<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6648-00000074"/> captain was,
                  moreover, a stranger. I am sorry to say that with Five Forks this latter condition
                  did not carry the quality of sanctity or reverence that usually obtains among
                  other nomads. There was, consequently, some little hesitation when the captain
                  turned upon the crowd, and asked for some one to act as his friend. To everybody's
                  astonishment, and to the indignation of many, the "Fool" stepped forward, and
                  offered himself in that capacity. I do not know whether Capt. McFadden would have
                  chosen him voluntarily; but he was constrained, in the absence of a better man, to
                  accept his services.</p>
               <p>The duel never took place. The preliminaries were all arranged, the spot
                  indicated; the men were present with their seconds; there was no interruption from
                  without; there was no explanation or apology passed—but the duel did not take
                  place. It may be readily imagined that these facts, which were all known to Five
                  Forks, threw the whole community into a fever of curiosity. The principals, the
                  surgeon, and one second left town the next day. Only the "Fool" remained.
                     <emph>He</emph> resisted all questioning, declaring himself held in honor not
                  to divulge: in short, conducted himself with consistent but exasperating folly. It
                  was not until six months had passed, that Col. Starbottle, the second of Calhoun
                  Bungstarter, in a moment of weakness, superinduced by the social glass,
                  condescended to explain. I should not do justice to the parties, if I did not give
                  that explanation in the colonel's own words. I may remark, in passing, that the
                  characteristic dignity of Col. Starbottle always became intensified by stimulants,
                  and that, by the same process, all sense of humor was utterly eliminated.</p>
               <p>"With the understanding that I am addressing myself confidentially to men of
                  honor," said the colonel, elevating his chest above the bar-room counter of the
                  Prairie Rose Saloon, "I trust that it will not be necessary for me to protect
                  myself from levity, as I was forced to do in Sacramento on the only other occasion
                  when I entered into an explanation of this delicate affair by—er—er—calling the
                  individual to a personal account—er. I do not believe," added the colonel,
                  slightly waving his glass of liquor in the air with a graceful gesture of
                  courteous deprecation, "knowing what I do of the present company, that such a
                  course of action is required here. Certainly not, sir, in the home of Mr.
                  Hawkins—er—the gentleman who represented Mr. Bungstarter, whose conduct, ged, sir,
                  is worthy of praise, blank me!"</p>
               <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6648-00000075"/>
               <p>Apparently satisfied with the gravity and respectful attention of his listeners,
                  Col. Starbottle smiled relentingly and sweetly, closed his eyes half-dreamily, as
                  if to recall his wandering thoughts, and began,—</p>
               <p>"As the spot selected was nearest the tenement of Mr. Hawkins, it was agreed that
                  the parties should meet there. They did so promptly at half-past six. The morning
                  being chilly, Mr. Hawkins extended the hospitalities of his house with a bottle of
                  Bourbon whiskey, of which all partook but myself. The reason for that exception
                  is, I believe, well known. It is my invariable custom to take brandy—a
                  wineglassful in a cup of strong coffee—immediately on rising. It stimulates the
                  functions, sir, without producing any blank derangement of the nerves."</p>
               <p>The barkeeper, to whom, as an expert, the colonel had graciously imparted this
                  information, nodded approvingly; and the colonel, amid a breathless silence, went
                  on.</p>
               <p>"We were about twenty minutes in reaching the spot. The ground was measured, the
                  weapons were loaded, when Mr. Bungstarter confided to me the information that he
                  was unwell, and in great pain. On consultation with Mr. Hawkins, it appeared that
                  his principal, in a distant part of the field, was also suffering, and in great
                  pain. The symptoms were such as a medical man would pronounce 'choleraic.' I say
                     <emph>would</emph> have pronounced; for, on examination, the surgeon was also
                  found to be—er—in pain, and, I regret to say, expressing himself in language
                  unbecoming the occasion. His impression was, that some powerful drug had been
                  administered. On referring the question to Mr. Hawkins, he remembered that the
                  bottle of whiskey partaken by them contained a medicine which he had been in the
                  habit of taking, but which, having failed to act upon him, he had concluded to be
                  generally ineffective, and had forgotten. His perfect willingness to hold himself
                  personally responsible to each of the parties, his genuine concern at the
                  disastrous effect of the mistake, mingled with his own alarm at the state of his
                  system, which—er—failed to—er—respond to the peculiar qualities of the medicine,
                  was most becoming to him as a man of honor and a gentleman. After an hour's delay,
                  both principals being completely exhausted, and abandoned by the surgeon, who was
                  unreasonably alarmed at his own condition, Mr. Hawkins and I agreed to remove our
                  men to Markleville. There, after a further consultation with Mr. Hawkins, an
                  amicable adjustment of all difficulties, honorable to both parties, and governed
                     by<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6648-00000076"/> profound secrecy, was arranged. I
                  believe," added the colonel, looking around, and setting down his glass, "no
                  gentleman has yet expressed himself other than satisfied with the result."</p>
               <p>Perhaps it was the colonel's manner; but, whatever was the opinion of Five Forks
                  regarding the intellectual display of Mr. Hawkins in this affair, there was very
                  little outspoken criticism at the moment. In a few weeks the whole thing was
                  forgotten, except as part of the necessary record of Hawkins's blunders, which was
                  already a pretty full one. Again, some later follies conspired to obliterate the
                  past, until, a year later, a valuable lead was discovered in the "Blazing Star"
                  tunnel, in the hill where he lived; and a large sum was offered him for a portion
                  of his land on the hilltop. Accustomed as Five Forks had become to the exhibition
                  of his folly, it was with astonishment that they learned that he resolutely and
                  decidedly refused the offer. The reason that he gave was still more astounding,—he
                  was about to build.</p>
               <p>To build a house upon property available for mining-purposes was preposterous; to
                  build at all, with a roof already covering him, was an act of extravagance; to
                  build a house of the style he proposed was simply madness.</p>
               <p>Yet here were facts. The plans were made, and the lumber for the new building was
                  already on the ground, while the shaft of the "Blazing Star" was being sunk below.
                  The site was, in reality, a very picturesque one, the building itself of a style
                  and quality hitherto unknown in Five Forks. The citizens, at first sceptical,
                  during their moments of recreation and idleness gathered doubtingly about the
                  locality. Day by day, in that climate of rapid growths, the building, pleasantly
                  known in the slang of Five Forks as the "Idiot Asylum," rose beside the green oaks
                  and clustering firs of Hawkins Hill, as if it were part of the natural phenomena.
                  At last it was completed. Then Mr. Hawkins proceeded to furnish it with an
                  expensiveness and extravagance of outlay quite in keeping with his former idiocy.
                  Carpets, sofas, mirrors, and finally a piano,—the only one known in the county,
                  and brought at great expense from Sacramento,—kept curiosity at a fever-heat. More
                  than that, there were articles and ornaments which a few married experts declared
                  only fit for women. When the furnishing of the house was complete,—it had occupied
                  two months of the speculative and curious attention of the camp,—Mr. Hawkins
                  locked the front-door, put the key in his pocket, and quietly<pb n="148-149"
                     xml:id="VAC6648-00000077"/> retired to his more humble roof, lower on the
                  hillside.</p>
               <p>I have not deemed it necessary to indicate to the intelligent reader all of the
                  theories which obtained in Five Forks during the erection of the building. Some of
                  them may be readily imagined. That the "Hag" had, by artful coyness and systematic
                  reticence, at last completely subjugated the "Fool," and that the new house was
                  intended for the nuptial bower of the (predestined) unhappy pair, was, of course,
                  the prevailing opinion. But when, after a reasonable time had elapsed, and the
                  house still remained untenanted, the more exasperating conviction forced itself
                  upon the general mind, that the "Fool" had been for the third time imposed upon;
                  when two months had elapsed, and there seemed no prospect of a mistress for the
                  new house,—I think public indignation became so strong, that, had the "Hag"
                  arrived, the marriage would have been publicly prevented. But no one appeared that
                  seemed to answer to this idea of an available tenant; and all inquiry of Mr.
                  Hawkins as to his intention in building a house, and not renting it, or occupying
                  it, failed to elicit any further information. The reasons that he gave were felt
                  to be vague, evasive, and unsatisfactory. He was in no hurry to move, he said.
                  When he <emph>was</emph> ready, it surely was not strange that he should like to
                  have his house all ready to receive him. He was often seen upon the veranda, of a
                  summer evening, smoking a cigar. It is reported that one night the house was
                  observed to be brilliantly lighted from garret to basement; that a neighbor,
                  observing this, crept toward the open parlor-window, and, looking in, espied the
                  "Fool" accurately dressed in evening costume, lounging upon a sofa in the
                  drawing-room, with the easy air of socially entertaining a large party.
                  Notwithstanding this, the house was unmistakably vacant that evening, save for the
                  presence of the owner, as the witness afterward testified. When this story was
                  first related, a few practical men suggested the theory that Mr. Hawkins was
                  simply drilling himself in the elaborate duties of hospitality against a probable
                  event in his history. A few ventured the belief that the house was haunted. The
                  imaginative editor of the Five Forks "Record" evolved from the depths of his
                  professional consciousness a story that Hawkins's sweetheart had died, and that he
                  regularly entertained her spirit in this beautifully furnished mausoleum. The
                  occasional spectacle of Hawkins's tall figure pacing the veranda on moonlight
                  nights lent some credence to this theory, until an unlooked-for incident diverted
                  all speculation into another channel.</p>
               <pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6648-00000078"/>
               <p>It was about this time that a certain wild, rude valley, in the neighborhood of
                  Five Forks, had become famous as a picturesque resort. Travellers had visited it,
                  and declared that there were more cubic yards of rough stone cliff, and a
                  waterfall of greater height, than any they had visited. Correspondents had written
                  it up with extravagant rhetoric and inordinate poetical quotation. Men and women
                  who had never enjoyed a sunset, a tree, or a flower, who had never appreciated the
                  graciousness or meaning of the yellow sunlight that flecked their homely doorways,
                  or the tenderness of a midsummer's night, to whose moonlight they bared their
                  shirt-sleeves or their <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tulle</foreign> dresses, came from
                  thousands of miles away to calculate the height of this rock, to observe the depth
                  of this chasm, to remark upon the enormous size of this unsightly tree, and to
                  believe with ineffable self-complacency that they really admired Nature. And so it
                  came to pass, that, in accordance with the tastes or weaknesses of the individual,
                  the more prominent and salient points of the valley were christened; and there was
                  a "Lace Handkerchief Fall," and the "Tears of Sympathy Cataract," and one
                  distinguished orator's "Peak," and several "Mounts" of various noted people,
                  living or dead, and an "Exclamation-Point," and a "Valley of Silent Adoration."
                  And, in course of time, empty soda-water bottles were found at the base of the
                  cataract, and greasy newspapers, and fragments of ham-sandwiches, lay at the dusty
                  roots of giant trees. With this, there were frequent irruptions of closely-shaven
                  and tightly-cravated men, and delicate, flower-faced women, in the one long street
                  of Five Forks, and a scampering of mules, and an occasional procession of dusty
                  brown-linen cavalry.</p>
               <p>A year after "Hawkins's Idiot Asylum" was completed, one day there drifted into
                  the valley a riotous cavalcade of "school-marms," teachers of the San-Francisco
                  public schools, out for a holiday. Not severely-spectacled Minervas, and chastely
                  armed and mailed Pallases, but, I fear, for the security of Five Forks, very
                  human, charming, and mischievous young women. At least, so the men thought,
                  working in the ditches, and tunnelling on the hillside; and when, in the interests
                  of science, and the mental advancement of juvenile posterity, it was finally
                  settled that they should stay in Five Forks two or three days for the sake of
                  visiting the various mines, and particularly the "Blazing Star" tunnel, there was
                  some flutter of masculine anxiety. There was a considerable inquiry for
                  "store-clothes," a hopeless overhauling of old and disused raiment, and a general
                  demand for "boiled shirts" and the barber.</p>
               <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6648-00000079"/>
               <p>Meanwhile, with that supreme audacity and impudent hardihood of the sex when
                  gregarious, the school-marms rode through the town, admiring openly the handsome
                  faces and manly figures that looked up from the ditches, or rose behind the cars
                  of ore at the mouths of tunnels. Indeed, it is alleged that Jenny Forester, backed
                  and supported by seven other equally shameless young women, had openly and
                  publicly waved her handkerchief to the florid Hercules of Five Forks, one Tom
                  Flynn, formerly of Virginia, leaving that good-natured but not over-bright giant
                  pulling his blonde mustaches in bashful amazement.</p>
               <p>It was a pleasant June afternoon that Miss Milly Arnot, principal of the primary
                  department of one of the public schools of San Francisco, having evaded her
                  companions, resolved to put into operation a plan which had lately sprung up in
                  her courageous and mischief-loving fancy. With that wonderful and mysterious
                  instinct of her sex, from whom no secrets of the affections are hid, and to whom
                  all hearts are laid open, she had heard the story of Hawkins's folly, and the
                  existence of the "Idiot Asylum." Alone, on Hawkins Hill, she had determined to
                  penetrate its seclusion. Skirting the underbrush at the foot of the hill, she
                  managed to keep the heaviest timber between herself and the "Blazing Star" tunnel
                  at its base, as well as the cabin of Hawkins, half-way up the ascent, until, by a
                  circuitous route, at last she reached, unobserved, the summit. Before her rose,
                  silent, darkened, and motionless, the object of her search. Here her courage
                  failed her, with all the characteristic inconsequence of her sex. A sudden fear of
                  all the dangers she had safely passed—bears, tarantulas, drunken men, and
                  lizards—came upon her. For a moment, as she afterward expressed it, "she thought
                  she should die." With this belief, probably, she gathered three large stones,
                  which she could hardly lift, for the purpose of throwing a great distance; put two
                  hair-pins in her mouth; and carefully re-adjusted with both hands two stray braids
                  of her lovely blue-black mane, which had fallen in gathering the stones. Then she
                  felt in the pockets of her linen duster for her card-case, handkerchief,
                  pocket-book, and smelling-bottle, and, finding them intact, suddenly assumed an
                  air of easy, ladylike unconcern, went up the steps of the veranda, and demurely
                  pulled the front doorbell, which she knew would not be answered. After a decent
                  pause, she walked around the encompassing veranda, examining the closed shutters
                  of the French windows until she found one that yielded to her touch. Here she
                     paused<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6648-00000080"/> again to adjust her
                  coquettish hat by the mirror-like surface of the long sash-window, that reflected
                  the full length of her pretty figure. And then she opened the window, and entered
                  the room.</p>
               <p>Although long closed, the house had a smell of newness and of fresh paint, that
                  was quite unlike the mouldiness of the conventional haunted house. The bright
                  carpets, the cheerful walls, the glistening oil-cloths, were quite inconsistent
                  with the idea of a ghost. With childish curiosity, she began to explore the silent
                  house, at first timidly,—opening the doors with a violent push, and then stepping
                  back from the threshold to make good a possible retreat,—and then more boldly, as
                  she became convinced of her security and absolute loneliness. In one of the
                  chambers—the largest—there were fresh flowers in a vase, evidently gathered that
                  morning; and, what seemed still more remarkable, the pitchers and ewers were
                  freshly filled with water. This obliged Miss Milly to notice another singular
                  fact, namely, that the house was free from dust, the one most obtrusive and
                  penetrating visitor of Five Forks. The floors and carpets had been recently swept,
                  the chairs and furniture carefully wiped and dusted. If the house <emph>was</emph>
                  haunted, it was possessed by a spirit who had none of the usual indifference to
                  decay and mould. And yet the beds had evidently never been slept in; the very
                  springs of the chair in which she sat creaked stiffly at the novelty; the
                  closet-doors opened with the reluctance of fresh paint and varnish; and in spite
                  of the warmth, cleanliness, and cheerfulness of furniture and decoration, there
                  was none of the ease of tenancy and occupation. As Miss Milly afterward confessed,
                  she longed to "tumble things around;" and, when she reached the parlor or
                  drawing-room again, she could hardly resist the desire. Particularly was she
                  tempted by a closed piano, that stood mutely against the wall. She thought she
                  would open it just to see who was the maker. That done, it would be no harm to try
                  its tone. She did so, with one little foot on the soft pedal. But Miss Milly was
                  too good a player, and too enthusiastic a musician, to stop at half-measures. She
                  tried it again, this time so sincerely, that the whole house seemed to spring into
                  voice. Then she stopped and listened. There was no response: the empty rooms
                  seemed to have relapsed into their old stillness. She stepped out on the veranda.
                  A woodpecker recommenced his tapping on an adjacent tree: the rattle of a cart in
                  the rocky gulch below the hill came faintly up. No one was to be seen far or near.
                  Miss Milly, re-assured, returned. She again ran her fingers over the keys,
                  stopped, caught at a melody<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6648-00000081"/> ody running
                  in her mind, half played it, and then threw away all caution. Before five minutes
                  had elapsed, she had entirely forgotten herself, and with her linen duster thrown
                  aside, her straw hat flung on the piano, her white hands bared, and a black loop
                  of her braided hair hanging upon her shoulder, was fairly embarked upon a flowing
                  sea of musical recollection.</p>
               <p>She had played, perhaps, half an hour, when having just finished an elaborate
                  symphony, and resting her hands on the keys, she heard very distinctly and
                  unmistakably the sound of applause from without. In an instant the fires of shame
                  and indignation leaped into her cheeks; and she rose from the instrument, and ran
                  to the window, only in time to catch sight of a dozen figures in blue and red
                  flannel shirts vanishing hurriedly through the trees below.</p>
               <p>Miss Milly's mind was instantly made up. I think I have already intimated, that,
                  under the stimulus of excitement, she was not wanting in courage; and as she
                  quietly resumed her gloves, hat, and duster, she was not, perhaps, exactly the
                  young person that it would be entirely safe for the timid, embarrassed, or
                  inexperienced of my sex to meet alone. She shut down the piano; and having
                  carefully reclosed all the windows and doors, and restored the house to its former
                  desolate condition, she stepped from the veranda, and proceeded directly to the
                  cabin of the unintellectual Hawkins, that reared its adobe chimney above the
                  umbrage a quarter of a mile below.</p>
               <p>The door opened instantly to her impulsive knock, and the "Fool of Five Forks"
                  stood before her. Miss Milly had never before seen the man designated by this
                  infelicitous title; and as he stepped backward, in half courtesy and half
                  astonishment, she was, for the moment, disconcerted. He was tall, finely formed,
                  and dark-bearded. Above cheeks a little hollowed by care and ill-health shone a
                  pair of hazel eyes, very large, very gentle, but inexpressibly sad and mournful.
                  This was certainly not the kind of man Miss Milly had expected to see; yet, after
                  her first embarrassment had passed, the very circumstance, oddly enough, added to
                  her indignation, and stung her wounded pride still more deeply. Nevertheless, the
                  arch hypocrite instantly changed her tactics with the swift intuition of her
                  sex.</p>
               <p>"I have come," she said with a dazzling smile, infinitely more dangerous than her
                  former dignified severity,—"I have come to ask your pardon for a great liberty I
                  have just taken. I believe the new house above us on the hill is yours. I was so
                  much pleased with its exterior, that I left<pb n="158-159"
                     xml:id="VAC6648-00000082"/> my friends for a moment below here," she continued
                  artfully, with a slight wave of the hand, as if indicating a band of fearless
                  Amazons without, and waiting to avenge any possible insult offered to one of their
                  number, "and ventured to enter it. Finding it unoccupied, as I had been told, I am
                  afraid I had the audacity to sit down and amuse myself for a few moments at the
                  piano, while waiting for my friends."</p>
               <p>Hawkins raised his beautiful eyes to hers. He saw a very pretty girl, with frank
                  gray eyes glistening with excitement, with two red, slightly freckled cheeks
                  glowing a little under his eyes, with a short scarlet upper-lip turned back, like
                  a rose-leaf, over a little line of white teeth, as she breathed somewhat hurriedly
                  in her nervous excitement. He saw all this calmly, quietly, and, save for the
                  natural uneasiness of a shy, reticent man, I fear without a quickening of his
                  pulse.</p>
               <p>"I knowed it," he said simply. "I heerd ye as I kem up."</p>
               <p>Miss Milly was furious at his grammar, his dialect, his coolness, and, still more,
                  at the suspicion that he was an active member of her invisible <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">claque</foreign>.</p>
               <p>"Ah!" she said, still smiling. "Then I think I heard <emph>you</emph>"—</p>
               <p>"I reckon not," he interrupted gravely. "I didn't stay long. I found the boys
                  hanging round the house, and I allowed at first I'd go in and kinder warn you; but
                  they promised to keep still: and you looked so comfortable, and wrapped up in your
                  music, that I hadn't the heart to disturb you, and kem away. I hope," he added
                  earnestly, "they didn't let on ez they heerd you. They ain't a bad lot,—them
                  Blazin' Star boys—though they're a little hard at times. But they'd no more hurt
                  ye then they would a—a—a cat!" continued Mr. Hawkins, blushing with a faint
                  apprehension of the inelegance of his simile.</p>
               <p>"No, no!" said Miss Milly, feeling suddenly very angry with herself, the "Fool,"
                  and the entire male population of Five Forks. "No! I have behaved foolishly, I
                  suppose—and, if they <emph>had</emph>, it would have served me right. But I only
                  wanted to apologize to you. You'll find every thing as you left it. Good-day!"</p>
               <p>She turned to go. Mr. Hawkins began to feel embarrassed. "I'd have asked ye to sit
                  down," he said finally, "if it hed been a place fit for a lady. I oughter done so,
                  enny way. I don't know what kept me from it. But I ain't well, miss. Times I get a
                  sort o' dumb ager,—it's the ditches, I think, miss,—and I don't seem to hev my
                  wits about me."</p>
               <p>Instantly Miss Arnot was all sympathy: her quick woman's heart was touched.</p>
               <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6648-00000083"/>
               <p>"Can I—can any thing be done?" she asked more timidly than she had before
                  spoken.</p>
               <p>"No—not onless ye remember suthin' about these pills." He exhibited a box
                  containing about half a dozen. "I forget the direction—I don't seem to remember
                  much, any way, these times. They're 'Jones's Vegetable Compound.' If ye've ever
                  took 'em, ye'll remember whether the reg'lar dose is eight. They ain't but six
                  here. But perhaps ye never tuk any," he added deprecatingly.</p>
               <p>"No," said Miss Milly curtly. She had usually a keen sense of the ludicrous; but
                  somehow Mr. Hawkins's eccentricity only pained her.</p>
               <p>"Will you let me see you to the foot of the hill?" he said again, after another
                  embarrassing pause.</p>
               <p>Miss Arnot felt instantly that such an act would condone her trespass in the eyes
                  of the world. She might meet some of her invisible admirers, or even her
                  companions; and, with all her erratic impulses, she was, nevertheless, a woman,
                  and did not entirely despise the verdict of conventionality. She smiled sweetly,
                  and assented; and in another moment the two were lost in the shadows of the
                  wood.</p>
               <p>Like many other apparently trivial acts in an uneventful life, it was decisive. As
                  she expected, she met two or three of her late applauders, whom, she fancied,
                  looked sheepish and embarrassed; she met, also, her companions looking for her in
                  some alarm, who really appeared astonished at her escort, and, she fancied, a
                  trifle envious of her evident success. I fear that Miss Arnot, in response to
                  their anxious inquiries, did not state entirely the truth, but, without actual
                  assertion, led them to believe that she had, at a very early stage of the
                  proceeding, completely subjugated this weak-minded giant, and had brought him
                  triumphantly to her feet. From telling this story two or three times, she got
                  finally to believing that she had some foundation for it, then to a vague sort of
                  desire that it would eventually prove to be true, and then to an equally vague
                  yearning to hasten that consummation. That it would redound to any satisfaction of
                  the "Fool" she did not stop to doubt. That it would cure him of his folly she was
                  quite confident. Indeed, there are very few of us, men or women, who do not
                  believe that even a hopeless love for ourselves is more conducive to the salvation
                  of the lover than a requited affection for another.</p>
               <p>The criticism of Five Forks was, as the reader may imagine, swift and conclusive.
                  When it was found out that Miss Arnot was not the "Hag" masquerading as a young
                     and<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6648-00000084"/> pretty girl, to the ultimate
                  deception of Five Forks in general, and the "Fool" in particular, it was at once
                  decided that nothing but the speedy union of the "Fool" and the "pretty
                  school-marm" was consistent with ordinary common sense. The singular good-fortune
                  of Hawkins was quite in accordance with the theory of his luck as propounded by
                  the camp. That, after the "Hag" failed to make her appearance, he should "strike a
                  lead" in his own house, without the trouble of "prospectin'," seemed to these
                  casuists as a wonderful but inevitable law. To add to these fateful probabilities,
                  Miss Arnot fell, and sprained her ankle, in the ascent of Mount Lincoln, and was
                  confined for some weeks to the hotel after her companions had departed. During
                  this period, Hawkins was civilly but grotesquely attentive. When, after a
                  reasonable time had elapsed, there still appeared to be no immediate prospect of
                  the occupancy of the new house, public opinion experienced a singular change in
                  regard to its theories of Mr. Hawkins's conduct. The "Hag" was looked upon as a
                  saint-like and long-suffering martyr to the weaknesses and inconsistency of the
                  "Fool." That, after erecting this new house at her request, he had suddenly "gone
                  back" on her; that his celibacy was the result of a long habit of weak proposal
                  and subsequent shameless rejection; and that he was now trying his hand on the
                  helpless school-marm, was perfectly plain to Five Forks. That he should be
                  frustrated in his attempts at any cost was equally plain. Miss Milly suddenly
                  found herself invested with a rude chivalry that would have been amusing, had it
                  not been at times embarrassing; that would have been impertinent, but for the
                  almost superstitious respect with which it was proffered. Every day somebody from
                  Five Forks rode out to inquire the health of the fair patient. "Hez Hawkins bin
                  over yer to-day?" queried Tom Flynn, with artful ease and indifference, as he
                  leaned over Miss Milly's easy-chair on the veranda. Miss Milly, with a faint pink
                  flush on her cheek, was constrained to answer, "No." "Well, he sorter sprained his
                  foot agin a rock yesterday," continued Flynn with shameless untruthfulness. "You
                  mus'n't think any thing o' that, Miss Arnot. He'll be over yer to-morrer; and
                  meantime he told me to hand this yer bookay with his re-gards, and this yer
                  specimen." And Mr. Flynn laid down the flowers he had picked <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">en route</foreign> against such an emergency, and presented
                  respectfully a piece of quartz and gold, which he had taken that morning from his
                  own sluice-box. "You mus'n't mind Hawkins's ways, Miss Milly," said another<pb
                     n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6648-00000085"/> sympathizing miner. "There ain't a
                  better man in camp than that theer Cy Hawkins—but he don't understand the ways o'
                  the world with wimen. He hasn't mixed as much with society as the rest of us," he
                  added, with an elaborate Chesterfieldian ease of manner; "but he means well."
                  Meanwhile a few other sympathetic tunnel-men were impressing upon Mr. Hawkins the
                  necessity of the greatest attention to the invalid. "It won't do, Hawkins," they
                  explained, "to let that there gal go back to San Francisco and say, that, when she
                  was sick and alone, the only man in Five Forks under whose roof she had rested,
                  and at whose table she had sat" (this was considered a natural but pardonable
                  exaggeration of rhetoric) "ever threw off on her; and it sha'n't be done. It ain't
                  the square thing to Five Forks." And then the "Fool" would rush away to the
                  valley, and be received by Miss Milly with a certain reserve of manner that
                  finally disappeared in a flush of color, some increased vivacity, and a pardonable
                  coquetry. And so the days passed. Miss Milly grew better in health, and more
                  troubled in mind; and Mr. Hawkins became more and more embarrassed; and Five Forks
                  smiled, and rubbed its hands, and waited for the approaching <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">denoûment</foreign>. And then it came—but not, perhaps, in the
                  manner that Five Forks had imagined.</p>
               <p>It was a lovely afternoon in July that a party of Eastern tourists rode into Five
                  Forks. They had just "done" the Valley of Big Things; and, there being one or two
                  Eastern capitalists among the party, it was deemed advisable that a proper
                  knowledge of the practical mining-resources of California should be added to their
                  experience of the merely picturesque in Nature. Thus far every thing had been
                  satisfactory; the amount of water which passed over the Fall was large, owing to a
                  backward season; some snow still remained in the cañons near the highest peaks;
                  they had ridden round one of the biggest trees, and through the prostrate trunk of
                  another. To say that they were delighted is to express feebly the enthusiasm of
                  these ladies and gentlemen, drunk with the champagny hospitality of their
                  entertainers, the utter novelty of scene, and the dry, exhilarating air of the
                  valley. One or two had already expressed themselves ready to live and die there;
                  another had written a glowing account to the Eastern press, depreciating all other
                  scenery in Europe and America; and, under these circumstances, it was reasonably
                  expected that Five Forks would do its duty, and equally impress the stranger after
                  its own fashion.</p>
               <p>Letters to this effect were sent from San Francisco by prominent capitalists
                  there; and,<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6648-00000086"/> under the able
                  superintendence of one of their agents, the visitors were taken in hand, shown
                  "what was to be seen," carefully restrained from observing what ought not to be
                  visible, and so kept in a blissful and enthusiastic condition. And so the
                  graveyard of Five Forks, in which but two of the occupants had died natural
                  deaths; the dreary, ragged cabins on the hillsides, with their sad-eyed, cynical,
                  broken-spirited occupants, toiling on day by day for a miserable pittance, and a
                  fare that a self-respecting Eastern mechanic would have scornfully rejected,—were
                  not a part of the Eastern visitor's recollection. But the hoisting works and
                  machinery of the "Blazing Star Tunnel Company" was,—the Blazing Star Tunnel
                  Company, whose "gentlemanly superintendent" had received private information from
                  San Francisco to do the "proper thing" for the party. Wherefore the valuable heaps
                  of ore in the company's works were shown; the oblong bars of gold, ready for
                  shipment, were playfully offered to the ladies who could lift and carry them away
                  unaided; and even the tunnel itself, gloomy, fateful, and peculiar, was shown as
                  part of the experience; and, in the noble language of one correspondent, "The
                  wealth of Five Forks, and the peculiar inducements that it offered to Eastern
                  capitalists," were established lished beyond a doubt. And then occurred a little
                  incident, which, as an unbiassed spectator, I am free to say offered no
                  inducements to anybody whatever, but which, for its bearing upon the central
                  figure of this veracious chronicle, I cannot pass over.</p>
               <p>It had become apparent to one or two more practical and sober-minded in the party,
                  that certain portions of the "Blazing Star" tunnel (owing, perhaps, to the
                  exigencies of a flattering annual dividend) were economically and imperfectly
                  "shored" and supported, and were, consequently, unsafe, insecure, and to be
                  avoided. Nevertheless, at a time when champagne corks were popping in dark
                  corners, and enthusiastic voices and happy laughter rang through the half-lighted
                  levels and galleries, there came a sudden and mysterious silence. A few lights
                  dashed swiftly by in the direction of a distant part of the gallery, and then
                  there was a sudden sharp issuing of orders, and a dull, ominous rumble. Some of
                  the visitors turned pale: one woman fainted.</p>
               <p>Something had happened. What? "Nothing" (the speaker is fluent, but uneasy)—"one
                  of the gentlemen, in trying to dislodge a 'specimen' from the wall, had knocked
                  away a support. There had been a 'cave'—the gentleman was caught, and buried below
                  his shoulders. It<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6648-00000087"/> was all right, they'd
                  get him out in a moment—only it required great care to keep from extending the
                  'cave.' Didn't know his name. It was that little man, the husband of that lively
                  lady with the black eyes. Eh! Hullo, there! Stop her! For God's sake! Not that
                  way! She'll fall from that shaft. She'll be killed!"</p>
               <p>But the lively lady was already gone. With staring black eyes, imploringly trying
                  to pierce the gloom, with hands and feet that sought to batter and break down the
                  thick darkness, with incoherent cries and supplications following the moving of
                     <foreign xml:lang="LAT">ignis fatuus</foreign> lights ahead, she ran, and ran
                  swiftly!—ran over treacherous foundations, ran by yawning gulfs, ran past
                  branching galleries and arches, ran wildly, ran despairingly, ran blindly, and at
                  last ran into the arms of the "Fool of Five Forks."</p>
               <p>In an instant she caught at his hand. "Oh, save him!" she cried. "You belong here;
                  you know this dreadful place: bring me to him. Tell me where to go, and what to
                  do, I implore you! Quick, he is dying! Come!"</p>
               <p>He raised his eyes to hers, and then, with a sudden cry, dropped the rope and
                  crowbar he was carrying, and reeled against the wall.</p>
               <p>"Annie!" he gasped slowly. "Is it you?"</p>
               <p>She caught at both his hands, brought her face to his with staring eyes, murmured,
                  "Good God, Cyrus!" and sank upon her knees before him.</p>
               <p>He tried to disengage the hand that she wrung with passionate entreaty.</p>
               <p>"No, no! Cyrus, you will forgive me—you will forget the past! God has sent you
                  here to-day. You will come with me. You will—you must—save him!"</p>
               <p>"Save who?" cried Cyrus hoarsely.</p>
               <p>"My husband!"</p>
               <p>The blow was so direct, so strong and overwhelming, that, even through her own
                  stronger and more selfish absorption, she saw it in the face of the man, and
                  pitied him.</p>
               <p>"I thought—you—knew—it," she faltered.</p>
               <p>He did not speak, but looked at her with fixed, dumb eyes. And then the sound of
                  distant voices and hurrying feet started her again into passionate life. She once
                  more caught his hand.</p>
               <p>"O Cyrus, hear me! If you have loved me through all these years, you will not fail
                  me now. You must save him! You can! You are brave and strong—you always were,
                  Cyrus. You will save him, Cyrus, for my sake, for the sake of your love for me!
                  You will—I know it. God bless you!"</p>
               <pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6648-00000088"/>
               <p>She rose as if to follow him; but, at a gesture of command, she stood still. He
                  picked up the rope and crowbar slowly, and in a dazed, blinded way, that, in her
                  agony of impatience and alarm, seemed protracted to cruel infinity. Then he
                  turned, and, raising her hand to his lips, kissed it slowly, looked at her again,
                  and the next moment was gone.</p>
               <p>He did not return; for at the end of the next half-hour, when they laid before her
                  the half-conscious, breathing body of her husband, safe and unharmed, but for
                  exhaustion and some slight bruises, she learned that the worst fears of the
                  workmen had been realized. In releasing him, a second cave had taken place. They
                  had barely time to snatch away the helpless body of her husband, before the strong
                  frame of his rescuer, Cyrus Hawkins, was struck and smitten down in his place.</p>
               <p>For two hours he lay there, crushed and broken-limbed, with a heavy beam lying
                  across his breast, in sight of all, conscious and patient. For two hours they had
                  labored around him, wildly, despairingly, hopefully, with the wills of gods and
                  the strength of giants; and at the end of that time they came to an upright
                  timber, which rested its base upon the beam. There was a cry for axes, and one was
                  already swinging in the air, when the dying man called to them feebly,—</p>
               <p>"Don't cut that upright!"</p>
               <p>"Why?"</p>
               <p>"It will bring down the whole gallery with it."</p>
               <p>"How?"</p>
               <p>"It's one of the foundations of my house."</p>
               <p>The axe fell from the workman's hand, and with a blanched face he turned to his
                  fellows. It was too true. They were in the uppermost gallery; and the "cave" had
                  taken place directly below the new house. After a pause, the "Fool" spoke again
                  more feebly.</p>
               <p>"The lady—quick!"</p>
               <p>They brought her,—a wretched, fainting creature, with pallid face and streaming
                  eyes,—and fell back as she bent her face above him.</p>
               <p>"It was built for you, Annie darling," he said in a hurried whisper, "and has been
                  waiting up there for you and me all these long days. It's deeded to you, Annie;
                  and you must—live there—with <emph>him!</emph> He will not mind that I shall be
                  always near you; for it stands above—my grave."</p>
               <p>And he was right. In a few minutes later, when he had passed away, they did not
                  move him, but sat by his body all night with a torch at his feet and head. And the
                  next day they walled up the gallery as a vault; but they put no mark or any sign
                  thereon, trusting, rather, to<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6648-00000089"/> the
                  monument, that, bright and cheerful, rose above him in the sunlight of the hill.
                  And those who heard the story said, "This is not an evidence of death and gloom
                  and sorrow, as are other monuments, but is a sign of life and light and hope,
                  wherefore shall all know that he who lies under it is what men call—"a fool."</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>BABY SYLVESTER.</head>
               <p>IT was at a little mining-camp in the California Sierras that he first dawned upon
                  me in all his grotesque sweetness.</p>
               <p>I had arrived early in the morning, but not in time to intercept the friend who
                  was the object of my visit. He had gone "prospecting,"—so they told me on the
                  river,—and would not probably return until late in the afternoon. They could not
                  say what direction he had taken; they could not suggest that I would be likely to
                  find him if I followed. But it was the general opinion that I had better wait.</p>
               <p>I looked around me. I was standing upon the bank of the river; and apparently the
                  only other human beings in the world were my interlocutors, who were even then
                  just disappearing from my horizon, down the steep bank, toward the river's dry
                  bed. I approached the edge of the bank.</p>
               <p>Where could I wait?</p>
               <p>Oh! anywhere,—down with them on the river bar, where they were working, if I
                  liked. Or I<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6648-00000090"/> could make myself at home
                  in any of those cabins that I found lying round loose. Or perhaps it would be
                  cooler and pleasanter for me in my friend's cabin on the hill. Did I see those
                  three large sugar-pines, and, a little to the right, a canvas roof and chimney,
                  over the bushes? Well, that was my friend's,—that was Dick Sylvester's cabin. I
                  could stake my horse in that little hollow, and just hang round there till he
                  came. I would find some books in the shanty. I could amuse myself with them; or I
                  could play with the baby.</p>
               <p>Do what?</p>
               <p>But they had already gone. I leaned over the bank, and called after their
                  vanishing figures,—</p>
               <p>"What did you say I could do?"</p>
               <p>The answer floated slowly up on the hot, sluggish air,—</p>
               <p>"Pla-a-y with the ba-by."</p>
               <p>The lazy echoes took it up, and tossed it languidly from hill to hill, until Bald
                  Mountain opposite made some incoherent remark about the baby; and then all was
                  still.</p>
               <p>I must have been mistaken. My friend was not a man of family; there was not a
                  woman within forty miles of the river camp; he never was so passionately devoted
                  to children as to import a luxury so expensive. I must have been mistaken.</p>
               <p>I turned my horse's head toward the hill. As we slowly climbed the narrow trail,
                  the little settlement might have been some exhumed Pompeiian suburb, so deserted
                  and silent were its habitations. The open doors plainly disclosed each
                  rudely-furnished interior,—the rough pine table, with the scant equipage of the
                  morning meal still standing; the wooden bunk, with its tumbled and dishevelled
                  blankets. A golden lizard, the very genius of desolate stillness, had stopped
                  breathless upon the threshold of one cabin; a squirrel peeped impudently into the
                  window of another; a woodpecker, with the general flavor of undertaking which
                  distinguishes that bird, withheld his sepulchral hammer from the coffin-lid of the
                  roof on which he was professionally engaged, as we passed. For a moment I half
                  regretted that I had not accepted the invitation to the river-bed; but, the next
                  moment, a breeze swept up the long, dark cañon, and the waiting files of the pines
                  beyond bent toward me in salutation. I think my horse understood, as well as
                  myself, that it was the cabins that made the solitude human, and therefore
                  unbearable; for he quickened his pace, and with a gentle trot brought me to the
                  edge of the wood, and the three pines that stood like vedettes before the
                  Sylvester outpost.</p>
               <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6648-00000091"/>
               <p>Unsaddling my horse in the little hollow, I unslung the long <foreign
                     xml:lang="SPA">riata</foreign> from the saddle-bow, and, tethering him to a
                  young sapling, turned toward the cabin. But I had gone only a few steps, when I
                  heard a quick trot behind me; and poor Pomposo, with every fibre tingling with
                  fear, was at my heels. I looked hurriedly around. The breeze had died away; and
                  only an occasional breath from the deep-chested woods, more like a long sigh than
                  any articulate sound, or the dry singing of a cicala in the heated cañon, were to
                  be heard. I examined the ground carefully for rattlesnakes, but in vain. Yet here
                  was Pomposo shivering from his arched neck to his sensitive haunches, his very
                  flanks pulsating with terror. I soothed him as well as I could, and then walked to
                  the edge of the wood, and peered into its dark recesses. The bright flash of a
                  bird's wing, or the quick dart of a squirrel, was all I saw. I confess it was with
                  something of superstitious expectation that I again turned towards the cabin. A
                  fairy-child, attended by Titania and her train, lying in an expensive cradle,
                  would not have surprised me: a Sleeping Beauty, whose awakening would have
                  repeopled these solitudes with life and energy, I am afraid I began to confidently
                  look for, and would have kissed without hesitation.</p>
               <p>But I found none of these. Here was the evidence of my friend's taste and
                  refinement, in the hearth swept scrupulously clean, in the picturesque arrangement
                  of the fur-skins that covered the floor and furniture, and the striped <foreign

                   lying on the wooden couch. Here were the walls fancifully papered with
                  illustrations from "The London News;" here was the woodcut portrait of Mr. Emerson
                  over the chimney, quaintly framed with blue-jays' wings; here were his few
                  favorite books on the swinging-shelf; and here, lying upon the couch, the latest
                  copy of "Punch." Dear Dick! The flour-sack was sometimes empty; but the gentle
                  satirist seldom missed his weekly visit.</p>
               <note place="foot" xml:id="note_001">

               </note>
               <p>I threw myself on the couch, and tried to read. But I soon exhausted my interest
                  in my friend's library, and lay there staring through the open door on the green
                  hillside beyond. The breeze again sprang up; and a delicious coolness, mixed with
                  the rare incense of the woods, stole through the cabin. The slumbrous droning of
                  bumblebees outside the canvas roof, the faint cawing of rooks on the opposite
                  mountain, and the fatigue of my morning ride, began to droop my eyelids. I pulled
                  the <foreign xml:lang="SPA">serápe</foreign> over me, as a<pb n="178-179"
                     xml:id="VAC6648-00000092"/> precaution against the freshening mountain breeze,
                  and in a few moments was asleep.</p>
               <p>I do not remember how long I slept. I must have been conscious, however, during my
                  slumber, of my inability to keep myself covered by the <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                     >serápe</foreign>; for I awoke once or twice, clutching it with a despairing
                  hand as it was disappearing over the foot of the couch. Then I became suddenly
                  aroused to the fact that my efforts to retain it were resisted by some equally
                  persistent force; and, letting it go, I was horrified at seeing it swiftly drawn
                  under the couch. At this point I sat up, completely awake; for immediately after,
                  what seemed to be an exaggerated muff began to emerge from under the couch.
                  Presently it appeared fully, dragging the <foreign xml:lang="SPA">serápe</foreign>
                  after it. There was no mistaking it now: it was a baby-bear,—a mere suckling, it
                  was true, a helpless roll of fat and fur, but unmistakably a grizzly cub!</p>
               <p>I cannot recall any thing more irresistibly ludicrous than its aspect as it slowly
                  raised its small, wondering eyes to mine. It was so much taller on its haunches
                  than its shoulders, its forelegs were so disproportionately small, that, in
                  walking, its hind-feet invariably took precedence. It was perpetually pitching
                  forward over its pointed, inoffensive nose, and recovering itself always, after
                  these involuntary somersaults, with the gravest astonishment. To add to its
                  preposterous appearance, one of its hind-feet was adorned by a shoe of
                  Sylvester's, into which it had accidentally and inextricably stepped. As this
                  somewhat impeded its first impulse to fly, it turned to me; and then, possibly
                  recognizing in the stranger the same species as its master, it paused. Presently
                  it slowly raised itself on its hind-legs, and vaguely and deprecatingly waved a
                  baby-paw, fringed with little hooks of steel. I took the paw, and shook it
                  gravely. From that moment we were friends. The little affair of the <foreign
                     xml:lang="SPA">serápe</foreign> was forgotten.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, I was wise enough to cement our friendship by an act of delicate
                  courtesy. Following the direction of his eyes, I had no difficulty in finding on a
                  shelf near the ridgepole the sugar-box and the square lumps of white sugar that
                  even the poorest miner is never without. While he was eating them, I had time to
                  examine him more closely. His body was a silky, dark, but exquisitely-modulated
                  gray, deepening to black in his paws and muzzle. His fur was excessively long,
                  thick, and soft as eider-down; the cushions of flesh beneath perfectly infantine
                  in their texture and contour. He was so very young, that the palms of his
                  half-human feet were still tender as a baby's. Except for the bright blue, steely
                  hooks, half-sheathed<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6648-00000093"/> sheathed in his
                  little toes, there was not a single harsh outline or detail in his plump figure.
                  He was as free from angles as one of Leda's offspring. Your caressing hand sank
                  away in his fur with dreamy languor. To look at him long was an intoxication of
                  the senses; to pat him was a wild delirium; to embrace him, an utter
                  demoralization of the intellectual faculties.</p>
               <p>When he had finished the sugar, he rolled out of the door with a half-diffident,
                  half-inviting look in his eyes as if he expected me to follow. I did so; but the
                  sniffing and snorting of the keen-scented Pomposo in the hollow not only revealed
                  the cause of his former terror, but decided me to take another direction. After a
                  moment's hesitation, he concluded to go with me, although I am satisfied, from a
                  certain impish look in his eye, that he fully understood and rather enjoyed the
                  fright of Pomposo. As he rolled along at my side, with a gait not unlike a drunken
                  sailor, I discovered that his long hair concealed a leather collar around his
                  neck, which bore for its legend the single word "Baby!" I recalled the mysterious
                  suggestion of the two miners. This, then, was the "baby" with whom I was to
                  "play."</p>
               <p>How we "played;" how Baby allowed me to roll him down hill, crawling and puffing
                  up again each time with perfect good-humor; how he climbed a young sapling after
                  my Panama hat, which I had "shied" into one of the topmost branches; how, after
                  getting it, he refused to descend until it suited his pleasure; how, when he did
                  come down, he persisted in walking about on three legs, carrying my hat, a crushed
                  and shapeless mass, clasped to his breast with the remaining one; how I missed him
                  at last, and finally discovered him seated on a table in one of the tenantless
                  cabins, with a bottle of sirup between his paws, vainly endeavoring to extract its
                  contents,—these and other details of that eventful day I shall not weary the
                  reader with now. Enough that, when Dick Sylvester returned, I was pretty well
                  fagged out, and the baby was rolled up, an immense bolster, at the foot of the
                  couch, asleep. Sylvester's first words after our greeting were,—</p>
               <p>"Isn't he delicious?"</p>
               <p>"Perfectly. Where did you get him?"</p>
               <p>"Lying under his dead mother, five miles from here," said Dick, lighting his pipe.
                  "Knocked her over at fifty yards: perfectly clean shot; never moved afterwards.
                  Baby crawled out, scared, but unhurt. She must have been carrying him in her
                  mouth, and dropped him when she faced me; for he wasn't more than three days old,
                  and not steady on his<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6648-00000094"/> pins. He takes
                  the only milk that comes to the settlement, brought up by Adams Express at seven
                  o'clock every morning. They say he looks like me. Do you think so?" asked Dick
                  with perfect gravity, stroking his hay-colored mustachios, and evidently assuming
                  his best expression.</p>
               <p>I took leave of the baby early the next morning in Sylvester's cabin, and, out of
                  respect to Pomposo's feelings, rode by without any postscript of expression. But
                  the night before I had made Sylvester solemnly swear, that, in the event of any
                  separation between himself and Baby, it should revert to me. "At the same time,"
                  he had added, "it's only fair to say that I don't think of dying just yet, old
                  fellow; and I don't know of anything else that would part the cub and me."</p>
               <p>Two months after this conversation, as I was turning over the morning's mail at my
                  office in San Francisco, I noticed a letter bearing Sylvester's familiar hand. But
                  it was post-marked "Stockton," and I opened it with some anxiety at once. Its
                  contents were as follows:—</p>

                              Look at the question well, and let me know speedily; for I've got him
                              as far as this place, and he's kicking up an awful row in the

               <p>It was due, then, at one o'clock that night.<pb n="184-185"
                     xml:id="VAC6648-00000095"/> For a moment I was staggered at my own
                  precipitation. I had as yet made no preparations, had said nothing to my landlady
                  about her new guest. I expected to arrange every thing in time; and now, through
                  Sylvester's indecent haste, that time had been shortened twelve hours.</p>
               <p>Something, however, must be done at once. I turned to Mrs. Brown. I had great
                  reliance in her maternal instincts: I had that still greater reliance common to
                  our sex in the general tender-heartedness of pretty women. But I confess I was
                  alarmed. Yet, with a feeble smile, I tried to introduce the subject with classical
                  ease and lightness. I even said, "If Shakspeare's Athenian clown, Mrs. Brown,
                  believed that a lion among ladies was a dreadful thing, what must"—But here I
                  broke down; for Mrs. Brown, with the awful intuition of her sex, I saw at once was
                  more occupied with my manner than my speech. So I tried a business <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">brusquerie</foreign>, and, placing the telegram in her hand,
                  said hurriedly, "We must do something about this at once. It's perfectly absurd;
                  but he will be here at one to-night. Beg thousand pardons; but business prevented
                  my speaking before"—and paused out of breath and courage.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Brown read the telegram gravely, lifted her pretty eyebrows, turned the paper
                  over, and looked on the other side, and then, in a remote and chilling voice,
                  asked me if she understood me to say that the mother was coming also.</p>
               <p>"Oh, dear no!" I exclaimed with considerable relief. "The mother is dead, you
                  know. Sylvester, that is my friend who sent this, shot her when the baby was only
                  three days old." But the expression of Mrs. Brown's face at this moment was so
                  alarming, that I saw that nothing but the fullest explanation would save me.
                  Hastily, and I fear not very coherently, I told her all.</p>
               <p>She relaxed sweetly. She said I had frightened her with my talk about lions.
                  Indeed, I think my picture of poor Baby, albeit a trifle highly colored, touched
                  her motherly heart. She was even a little vexed at what she called Sylvester's
                  "hardheartedness." Still I was not without some apprehension. It was two months
                  since I had seen him; and Sylvester's vague allusion to his "slinging an ugly
                  left" pained me. I looked at sympathetic little Mrs. Brown; and the thought of
                  Watson's pups covered me with guilty confusion.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Brown had agreed to sit up with me until he arrived. One o'clock came, but no
                  Baby. Two o'clock, three o'clock, passed. It was almost four when there was a wild
                     clatter<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6648-00000096"/> of horses' hoofs outside,
                  and with a jerk a wagon stopped at the door. In an instant I had opened it, and
                  confronted a stranger. Almost at the same moment, the horses attempted to run away
                  with the wagon.</p>
               <p>The stranger's appearance was, to say the least, disconcerting. His clothes were
                  badly torn and frayed; his linen sack hung from his shoulders like a herald's
                  apron; one of his hands was bandaged; his face scratched; and there was no hat on
                  his dishevelled head. To add to the general effect, he had evidently sought relief
                  from his woes in drink; and he swayed from side to side as he clung to the
                  door-handle, and, in a very thick voice, stated that he had "suthin" for me
                  outside. When he had finished, the horses made another plunge.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Brown thought they must be frightened at something.</p>
               <p>"Frightened!" laughed the stranger with bitter irony. "Oh, no! Hossish ain't
                  frightened! On'y ran away four timesh comin' here. Oh, no! Nobody's frightened.
                  Every thin's all ri'. Ain't it, Bill?" he said, addressing the driver. "On'y been
                  overboard twish; knocked down a hatchway once. Thash nothin'! On'y two men unner
                  doctor's han's at Stockton. Thash nothin'! Six hunner dollarsh cover all
                  dammish."</p>
               <p>I was too much disheartened to reply, but moved toward the wagon. The stranger
                  eyed me with an astonishment that almost sobered him.</p>
               <p>"Do you reckon to tackle that animile yourself?" he asked, as he surveyed me from
                  head to foot.</p>
               <p>I did not speak, but, with an appearance of boldness I was far from feeling,
                  walked to the wagon, and called "Baby!"</p>
               <p>"All ri'. Cash loose them straps, Bill, and stan' clear."</p>
               <p>The straps were cut loose; and Baby, the remorseless, the terrible, quietly
                  tumbled to the ground, and, rolling to my side, rubbed his foolish head against
                  me.</p>
               <p>I think the astonishment of the two men was beyond any vocal expression. Without a
                  word, the drunken stranger got into the wagon, and drove away.</p>
               <p>And Baby? He had grown, it is true, a trifle larger; but he was thin, and bore the
                  marks of evident ill usage. His beautiful coat was matted and unkempt; and his
                  claws, those bright steel hooks, had been ruthlessly pared to the quick. His eyes
                  were furtive and restless; and the old expression of stupid good humor had changed
                  to one of intelligent distrust. His intercourse with mankind had evidently
                     quickened<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6648-00000097"/> ened his intellect,
                  without broadening his moral nature.</p>
               <p>I had great difficulty in keeping Mrs. Brown from smothering him in blankets, and
                  ruining his digestion with the delicacies of her larder; but I at last got him
                  completely rolled up in the corner of my room, and asleep. I lay awake some time
                  later with plans for his future. I finally determined to take him to Oakland—where
                  I had built a little cottage, and always spent my Sundays—the very next day. And
                  in the midst of a rosy picture of domestic felicity, I fell asleep.</p>
               <p>When I awoke, it was broad day. My eyes at once sought the corner where Baby had
                  been lying; but he was gone. I sprang from the bed, looked under it, searched the
                  closet, but in vain. The door was still locked; but there were the marks of his
                  blunted claws upon the sill of the window that I had forgotten to close. He had
                  evidently escaped that way. But where? The window opened upon a balcony, to which
                  the only other entrance was through the hall. He must be still in the house.</p>
               <p>My hand was already upon the bell-rope; but I stayed it in time. If he had not
                  made himself known, why should I disturb the house? I dressed myself hurriedly,
                  and slipped into the hall. The first object that met my eyes was a boot lying upon
                  the stairs. It bore the marks of Baby's teeth; and, as I looked along the hall, I
                  saw too plainly that the usual array of freshly-blackened boots and shoes before
                  the lodgers' doors was not there. As I ascended the stairs, I found another, but
                  with the blacking carefully licked off. On the third floor were two or three more
                  boots, slightly mouthed; but at this point Baby's taste for blacking had evidently
                  palled. A little farther on was a ladder, leading to an open scuttle. I mounted
                  the ladder, and reached the flat roof, that formed a continuous level over the row
                  of houses to the corner of the street. Behind the chimney on the very last roof,
                  something was lurking. It was the fugitive Baby. He was covered with dust and dirt
                  and fragments of glass. But he was sitting on his hind-legs, and was eating an
                  enormous slab of peanut candy, with a look of mingled guilt and infinite
                  satisfaction. He even, I fancied, slightly stroked his stomach with his disengaged
                  fore-paw as I approached. He knew that I was looking for him; and the expression
                  of his eye said plainly, "The past, at least, is secure."</p>
               <p>I hurried him, with the evidences of his guilt, back to the scuttle, and descended
                  on tiptoe to the floor beneath. Providence favored<pb n="190-191"
                     xml:id="VAC6648-00000098"/> us: I met no one on the stairs; and his own
                  cushioned tread was inaudible. I think he was conscious of the dangers of
                  detection; for he even forebore to breathe, or much less chew the last mouthful he
                  had taken; and he skulked at my side with the sirup dropping from his motionless
                  jaws. I think he would have silently choked to death just then, for my sake; and
                  it was not until I had reached my room again, and threw myself panting on the
                  sofa, that I saw how near strangulation he had been. He gulped once or twice
                  apologetically, and then walked to the corner of his own accord, and rolled
                  himself up like an immense sugarplum, sweating remorse and treacle at every
                  pore.</p>
               <p>I locked him in when I went to breakfast, when I found Mrs. Brown's lodgers in a
                  state of intense excitement over certain mysterious events of the night before,
                  and the dreadful revelations of the morning. It appeared that burglars had entered
                  the block from the scuttles; that, being suddenly alarmed, they had quitted our
                  house without committing any depredation, dropping even the boots they had
                  collected in the halls; but that a desperate attempt had been made to force the
                  till in the confectioner's shop on the corner, and that the glass show-cases had
                  been ruthlessly smashed. A courageous servant in No. 4 had seen a masked burglar,
                  on his hands and knees, attempting to enter their scuttle; but, on her shouting,
                  "Away wid yees!" he instantly fled.</p>
               <p>I sat through this recital with cheeks that burned uncomfortably; nor was I the
                  less embarrassed, on raising my eyes, to meet Mrs. Brown's fixed curiously and
                  mischievously on mine. As soon as I could make my escape from the table, I did so,
                  and, running rapidly up stairs, sought refuge from any possible inquiry in my own
                  room. Baby was still asleep in the corner. It would not be safe to remove him
                  until the lodgers had gone down town; and I was revolving in my mind the
                  expediency of keeping him until night veiled his obtrusive eccentricity from the
                  public eye, when there came a cautious tap at my door. I opened it. Mrs. Brown
                  slipped in quietly, closed the door softly, stood with her back against it, and
                  her hand on the knob, and beckoned me mysteriously towards her. Then she asked in
                  a low voice,—</p>
               <p>"Is hair-dye poisonous?"</p>
               <p>I was too confounded to speak.</p>
               <p>"Oh, do! you know what I mean," she said impatiently. "This stuff." She produced
                  suddenly from behind her a bottle with a Greek label so long as to run two or
                  three times spirally around it from top to bottom. "He<pb n="192-193"
                     xml:id="VAC6648-00000099"/> says it isn't a dye: it's a vegetable preparation,
                  for invigorating"—</p>
               <p>"Who says?" I asked despairingly.</p>
               <p>"Why, Mr. Parker, of course!" said Mrs. Brown severely, with the air of having
                  repeated the name a great many times,—"the old gentleman in the room above. The
                  simple question I want to ask," she continued with the calm manner of one who has
                  just convicted another of gross ambiguity of language, "is only this: If some of
                  this stuff were put in a saucer, and left carelessly on the table, and a child, or
                  a baby, or a cat, or any young animal, should come in at the window, and drink it
                  up,—a whole saucer full,—because it had a sweet taste, would it be likely to hurt
                  them?"</p>
               <p>I cast an anxious glance at Baby, sleeping peacefully in the corner, and a very
                  grateful one at Mrs. Brown, and said I didn't think it would.</p>
               <p>"Because," said Mrs. Brown loftily as she opened the door, "I thought, if it was
                  poisonous, remedies might be used in time. Because," she added suddenly,
                  abandoning her lofty manner, and wildly rushing to the corner with a frantic
                  embrace of the unconscious Baby, "because, if any nasty stuff should turn its
                  booful hair a horrid green, or a naughty pink, it would break its own muzzer's
                  heart, it would!"</p>
               <p>But, before I could assure Mrs. Brown of the inefficiency of hair-dye as an
                  internal application, she had darted from the room.</p>
               <p>That night, with the secrecy of defaulters, Baby and I decamped from Mrs. Brown's.
                  Distrusting the too emotional nature of that noble animal, the horse, I had
                  recourse to a handcart, drawn by a stout Irishman, to convey my charge to the
                  ferry. Even then, Baby refused to go, unless I walked by the cart, and at times
                  rode in it.</p>
               <p>"I wish," said Mrs. Brown, as she stood by the door, wrapped in an immense shawl,
                  and saw us depart, "I wish it looked less solemn,—less like a pauper's
                  funeral."</p>
               <p>I must admit, that, as I walked by the cart that night, I felt very much as if I
                  were accompanying the remains of some humble friend to his last resting-place; and
                  that, when I was obliged to ride in it, I never could entirely convince myself
                  that I was not helplessly overcome by liquor, or the victim of an accident,
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en route</foreign> to the hospital. But at last we
                  reached the ferry. On the boat, I think no one discovered Baby, except a drunken
                  man, who approached me to ask for a light for his cigar, but who suddenly dropped
                  it, and fled in dismay to the gentlemen's cabin, where his incoherent ravings were
                  luckily taken for the earlier indications of <foreign xml:lang="LAT">delirium
                     tremens</foreign>.</p>
               <pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6648-00000100"/>
               <p>It was nearly midnight when I reached my little cottage on the outskirts of
                  Oakland; and it was with a feeling of relief and security that I entered, locked
                  the door, and turned him loose in the hall, satisfied that henceforward his
                  depredations would be limited to my own property. He was very quiet that night;
                  and after he had tried to mount the hat-rack, under the mistaken impression that
                  it was intended for his own gymnastic exercise, and knocked all the hats off, he
                  went peaceably to sleep on the rug.</p>
               <p>In a week, with the exercise afforded him by the run of a large, carefully-boarded
                  enclosure, he recovered his health, strength, spirits, and much of his former
                  beauty. His presence was unknown to my neighbors, although it was noticeable that
                  horses invariably "shied" in passing to the windward of my house, and that the
                  baker and milkman had great difficulty in the delivery of their wares in the
                  morning, and indulged in unseemly and unnecessary profanity in so doing.</p>
               <p>At the end of the week, I determined to invite a few friends to see the Baby, and
                  to that purpose wrote a number of formal invitations. After descanting, at some
                  length, on the great expense and danger attending his capture and training, I
                  offered a programme of the performance ance, of the "Infant Phenomenon of Sierran
                  Solitudes," drawn up into the highest professional profusion of alliteration and
                  capital letters. A few extracts will give the reader some idea of his educational
                  progress:— <list>
                     <item>1. He will, rolled up in a Round Ball, roll down the Wood-Shed Rapidly,
                        illustrating His manner of Escaping from His Enemy in His Native
                        Wilds.</item>
                     <item>2. He will Ascend the Well-Pole, and remove from the Very Top a Hat, and
                        as much of the Crown and Brim thereof, as May be Permitted.</item>
                     <item>3. He will perform in a pantomime, descriptive of the Conduct of the Big
                        Bear, The Middle-Sized Bear, and The Little Bear of the Popular Nursery
                        Legend.</item>
                     <item>4. He will shake his chain Rapidly, showing his Manner of striking Dismay

               </p>
               <p>The morning of the exhibition came; but an hour before the performance the
                  wretched Baby was missing. The Chinese cook could not indicate his whereabouts. I
                  searched the premises thoroughly; and then, in despair, took my hat, and hurried
                  out into the narrow lane that led toward the open fields and the woods beyond. But
                  I found no trace nor track of Baby Sylvester. I returned, after an hour's
                  fruitless search, to find my guests already assembled on the rear veranda. I
                  briefly recounted my disappointment, my probable loss, and begged their
                  assistance.</p>
               <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6648-00000101"/>
               <p>"Why," said a Spanish friend, who prided himself on his accurate knowledge of
                  English, to Barker, who seemed to be trying vainly to rise from his reclining
                  position on the veranda, "why do you not disengage yourself from the veranda of
                  our friend? And why, in the name of Heaven, do you attach to yourself so much of
                  this thing, and make to yourself such unnecessary contortion? Ah," he continued,
                  suddenly withdrawing one of his own feet from the veranda with an evident effort,
                  "I am myself attached! Surely it is something here!"</p>
               <p>It evidently was. My guests were all rising with difficulty. The floor of the
                  veranda was covered with some glutinous substance. It was—sirup!</p>
               <p>I saw it all in a flash. I ran to the barn. The keg of "golden sirup," purchased
                  only the day before, lay empty upon the floor. There were sticky tracks all over
                  the enclosure, but still no Baby.</p>
               <p>"There's something moving the ground over there by that pile of dirt," said
                  Barker.</p>
               <p>He was right. The earth was shaking in one corner of the enclosure like an
                  earthquake. I approached cautiously. I saw, what I had not before noticed, that
                  the ground was thrown up; and there, in the middle of an immense grave-like
                  cavity, crouched Baby Sylvester, still digging, and slowly but surely sinking from
                  sight in a mass of dust and clay.</p>
               <p>What were his intentions? Whether he was stung by remorse, and wished to hide
                  himself from my reproachful eyes, or whether he was simply trying to dry his
                  sirup-besmeared coat, I never shall know; for that day, alas! was his last with
                  me.</p>
               <p>He was pumped upon for two hours, at the end of which time he still yielded a thin
                  treacle. He was then taken, and carefully inwrapped in blankets, and locked up in
                  the store-room. The next morning he was gone! The lower portion of the window sash
                  and pane were gone too. His successful experiments on the fragile texture of glass
                  at the confectioner's, on the first day of his entrance to civilization, had not
                  been lost upon him. His first essay at combining cause and effect ended in his
                  escape.</p>
               <p>Where he went, where he hid, who captured him, if he did not succeed in reaching
                  the foothills beyond Oakland, even the offer of a large reward, backed by the
                  efforts of an intelligent police, could not discover. I never saw him again from
                  that day until—</p>
               <p>Did I see him? I was in a horse-car on Sixth Avenue, a few days ago, when the
                  horses suddenly became unmanageable, and left the track for the sidewalk, amid the
                  oaths and execrations<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6648-00000102"/> crations of the
                  driver. Immediately in front of the car a crowd had gathered around two performing
                  bears and a showman. One of the animals, thin, emaciated, and the mere wreck of
                  his native strength, attracted my attention. I endeavored to attract his. He
                  turned a pair of bleared, sightless eyes in my direction; but there was no sign of
                  recognition. I leaned from the car-window, and called softly, "Baby!" But he did
                  not heed. I closed the window. The car was just moving on, when he suddenly
                  turned, and, either by accident or design, thrust a callous paw through the
                  glass.</p>
               <p>"It's worth a dollar and half to put in a new pane," said the conductor, "if folks
                  will play with bears!"—</p>

               <head>AN EPISODE OF FIDDLETOWN.</head>
               <p>IN 1858 Fiddletown considered her a very pretty woman. She had a quantity of light
                  chestnut hair, a good figure, a dazzling complexion, and a certain languid grace
                  which passed easily for gentlewomanliness. She always dressed becomingly, and in
                  what Fiddletown accepted as the latest fashion. She had only two blemishes: one of
                  her velvety eyes, when examined closely, had a slight cast; and her left cheek
                  bore a small scar left by a single drop of vitriol—happily the only drop of an
                  entire phial—thrown upon her by one of her own jealous sex, that reached the
                  pretty face it was intended to mar. But, when the observer had studied the eyes
                  sufficiently to notice this defect, he was generally incapacitated for criticism;
                  and even the scar on her cheek was thought by some to add piquancy to her smile.
                  The youthful editor of "The Fiddletown Avalanche" had said privately that it was
                  "an exaggerated dimple." Col. Starbottle was instantly "reminded of the
                  beautifying patches of the days of Queen Anne,<pb n="200-201"
                     xml:id="VAC6648-00000103"/> but more particularly, sir, of the blankest
                  beautiful women, that, blank you, you ever laid your two blank eyes upon,—a Creole
                  woman, sir, in New Orleans. And this woman had a scar,—a line extending, blank me,
                  from her eye to her blank chin. And this woman, sir, thrilled you, sir; maddened
                  you, sir; absolutely sent your blank soul to perdition with her blank fascination!
                  And one day I said to her, 'Celeste, how in blank did you come by that beautiful
                  scar, blank you?' And she said to me, 'Star, there isn't another white man that
                  I'd confide in but you; but I made that scar myself, purposely, I did, blank me.'
                  These were her very words, sir, and perhaps you think it a blank lie, sir; but
                  I'll put up any blank sum you can name and prove it, blank me."</p>
               <p>Indeed, most of the male population of Fiddletown were or had been in love with
                  her. Of this number, about one-half believed that their love was returned, with
                  the exception, possibly, of her own husband. He alone had been known to express
                  scepticism.</p>
               <p>The name of the gentleman who enjoyed this infelicitous distinction was
                  Tretherick. He had been divorced from an excellent wife to marry this Fiddletown
                  enchantress. She, also, had been divorced; but it was hinted that some previous
                  experiences of hers in that legal formality had made it perhaps less novel, and
                  probably less sacrificial. I would not have it inferred from this that she was
                  deficient in sentiment, or devoid of its highest moral expression. Her intimate
                  friend had written (on the occasion of her second divorce), "The cold world does
                  not understand Clara yet;" and Col. Starbottle had remarked blankly, that with the
                  exception of a single woman in Opelousas Parish, La., she had more soul than the
                  whole caboodle of them put together. Few indeed could read those lines entitled
                  "Infelissimus," commencing, "Why waves no cypress o'er this brow?" originally
                  published in "The Avalanche," over the signature of "The Lady Clare," without
                  feeling the tear of sensibility tremble on his eyelids, or the glow of virtuous
                  indignation mantle his cheek, at the low brutality and pitiable jocularity of "The
                  Dutch Flat Intelligencer," which the next week had suggested the exotic character
                  of the cypress, and its entire absence from Fiddletown, as a reasonable answer to
                  the query.</p>
               <p>Indeed, it was this tendency to elaborate her feelings in a metrical manner, and
                  deliver them to the cold world through the medium of the newspapers, that first
                  attracted the attention of Tretherick. Several poems descriptive of the effects of
                  California scenery upon a too sensitive soul, and of the vague yearnings for the
                     infinite,<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6648-00000104"/> which an enforced study of
                  the heartlessness of California society produced in the poetic breast, impressed
                  Mr. Tretherick, who was then driving a six-mule freight-wagon between Knight's
                  Ferry and Stockton, to seek out the unknown poetess. Mr. Tretherick was himself
                  dimly conscious of a certain hidden sentiment in his own nature; and it is
                  possible that some reflections on the vanity of his pursuit,—he supplied several
                  mining-camps with whiskey and tobacco,—in conjunction with the dreariness of the
                  dusty plain on which he habitually drove, may have touched some chord in sympathy
                  with this sensitive woman. Howbeit, after a brief courtship,—as brief as was
                  consistent with some previous legal formalities,—they were married; and Mr.
                  Tretherick brought his blushing bride to Fiddletown, or "Fidéletown," as Mrs.
                  Tretherick preferred to call it in her poems.</p>
               <p>The union was not a felicitous one. It was not long before Mr. Tretherick
                  discovered that the sentiment he had fostered while freighting between Stockton
                  and Knight's Ferry was different from that which his wife had evolved from the
                  contemplation of California scenery and her own soul. Being a man of imperfect
                  logic, this caused him to beat her; and she, being equally faulty in deduction,
                  was impelled to a certain degree of unfaithfulness on the same premise. Then Mr.
                  Tretherick began to drink, and Mrs. Tretherick to contribute regularly to the
                  columns of "The Avalanche." It was at this time that Col. Starbottle discovered a
                  similarity in Mrs. Tretherick's verse to the genius of Sappho, and pointed it out
                  to the citizens of Fiddletown in a two-columned criticism, signed "A.S.," also
                  published in "The Avalanche," and supported by extensive quotation. As "The
                  Avalanche" did not possess a font of Greek type, the editor was obliged to
                  reproduce the Leucadian numbers in the ordinary Roman letter, to the intense
                  disgust of Col. Starbottle, and the vast delight of Fiddletown, who saw fit to
                  accept the text as an excellent imitation of Choctaw,—a language with which the
                  colonel, as a whilom resident of the Indian Territories, was supposed to be
                  familiar. Indeed, the next week's "Intelligencer" contained some vile doggerel,
                  supposed to be an answer to Mrs. Tretherick's poem, ostensibly written by the wife
                  of a Digger Indian chief, accompanied by a glowing eulogium, signed "A.S.S."</p>
               <p>The result of this jocularity was briefly given in a later copy of "The
                  Avalanche." "An unfortunate rencounter took place on Monday last, between the Hon.
                  Jackson Flash of "The Dutch Flat Intelligencer" and the well-known Col. Starbottle
                  of this place, in front of the Eureka<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6648-00000105"/>
                  Saloon. Two shots were fired by the parties without injury to either, although it
                  is said that a passing Chinaman received fifteen buckshot in the calves of his
                  legs from the colonel's double-barrelled shot-gun, which were not intended for
                  him. John will learn to keep out of the way of Melican man's fire-arms hereafter.
                  The cause of the affray is not known, although it is hinted that there is a lady
                  in the case. The rumor that points to a well-known and beautiful poetess whose
                  lucubrations have often graced our columns seems to gain credence from those that
                  are posted."</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the passiveness displayed by Tretherick under these trying circumstances
                  was fully appreciated in the gulches. "The old man's head is level," said one
                  long-booted philosopher. "Ef the colonel kills Flash, Mrs. Tretherick is avenged:
                  if Flash drops the colonel, Tretherick is all right. Either way, he's got a sure
                  thing." During this delicate condition of affairs, Mrs. Tretherick one day left
                  her husband's home, and took refuge at the Fiddletown Hotel, with only the clothes
                  she had on her back. Here she staid for several weeks, during which period it is
                  only justice to say that she bore herself with the strictest propriety.</p>
               <p>It was a clear morning in early spring that Mrs. Tretherick, unattended, left the
                  hotel, and walked down the narrow street toward the fringe of dark pines which
                  indicated the extreme limits of Fiddletown. The few loungers at that early hour
                  were pre-occupied with the departure of the Wingdown coach at the other extremity
                  of the street; and Mrs. Tretherick reached the suburbs of the settlement without
                  discomposing observation. Here she took a cross street or road, running at right
                  angles with the main thoroughfare of Fiddletown, and passing through a belt of
                  woodland. It was evidently the exclusive and aristocratic avenue of the town. The
                  dwellings were few, ambitious, and uninterrupted by shops. And here she was joined
                  by Col. Starbottle.</p>
               <p>The gallant colonel, notwithstanding that he bore the swelling port which usually
                  distinguished him, that his coat was tightly buttoned, and his boots tightly
                  fitting, and that his cane, hooked over his arm, swung jauntily, was not entirely
                  at his ease. Mrs. Tretherick, however, vouchsafed him a gracious smile and a
                  glance of her dangerous eyes; and the colonel, with an embarrassed cough and a
                  slight strut, took his place at her side.</p>
               <p>"The coast is clear," said the colonel, "and Tretherick is over at Dutch Flat on a
                  spree. There is no one in the house but a Chinaman;<pb n="206-207"
                     xml:id="VAC6648-00000106"/> and you need fear no trouble from him.
                     <emph>I</emph>," he continued, with a slight inflation of the chest that
                  imperilled the security of his button, "I will see that you are protected in the
                  removal of your property."</p>
               <p>"I'm sure it's very kind of you, and so disinterested!" simpered the lady as they
                  walked along. "It's so pleasant to meet some one who has soul,—some one to
                  sympathize with in a community so hardened and heartless as this." And Mrs.
                  Tretherick cast down her eyes, but not until they wrought their perfect and
                  accepted work upon her companion.</p>
               <p>"Yes, certainly, of course," said the colonel, glancing nervously up and down the
                  street,—"yes, certainly." Perceiving, however, that there was no one in sight or
                  hearing, he proceeded at once to inform Mrs. Tretherick that the great trouble of
                  his life, in fact, had been the possession of too much soul. That many women—as a
                  gentleman she would excuse him, of course, from mentioning names—but many
                  beautiful women had often sought his society, but being deficient, madam,
                  absolutely deficient, in this quality, he could not reciprocate. But when two
                  natures thoroughly in sympathy, despising alike the sordid trammels of a low and
                  vulgar community, and the conventional restraints of a hypocritical society,— when
                  two souls in perfect accord met and mingled in poetical union, then—but here the
                  colonel's speech, which had been remarkable for a certain whiskey-and-watery
                  fluency, grew husky, almost inaudible, and decidedly incoherent. Possibly Mrs.
                  Tretherick may have heard something like it before, and was enabled to fill the
                  hiatus. Nevertheless, the cheek that was on the side of the colonel was quite
                  virginal and bashfully conscious until they reached their destination.</p>
               <p>It was a pretty little cottage, quite fresh and warm with paint, very pleasantly
                  relieved against a platoon of pines, some of whose foremost files had been
                  displaced to give freedom to the fenced enclosure in which it sat. In the vivid
                  sunlight and perfect silence, it had a new, uninhabited look, as if the carpenters
                  and painters had just left it. At the farther end of the lot, a Chinaman was
                  stolidly digging; but there was no other sign of occupancy. "The coast," as the
                  colonel had said, was indeed "clear." Mrs. Tretherick paused at the gate. The
                  colonel would have entered with her, but was stopped by a gesture. "Come for me in
                  a couple of hours, and I shall have every thing packed," she said, as she smiled,
                  and extended her hand. The colonel seized and pressed it with great fervor.
                  Perhaps the pressure was<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6648-00000107"/> slightly
                  returned; for the gallant colonel was impelled to inflate his chest, and trip away
                  as smartly as his stubby-toed, high-heeled boots would permit. When he had gone,
                  Mrs. Tretherick opened the door, listened a moment in the deserted hall, and then
                  ran quickly up stairs to what had been her bedroom.</p>
               <p>Every thing there was unchanged as on the night she left it. On the dressing-table
                  stood her bandbox, as she remembered to have left it when she took out her bonnet.
                  On the mantle lay the other glove she had forgotten in her flight. The two lower
                  drawers of the bureau were half open (she had forgotten to shut them); and on its
                  marble top lay her shawl-pin and a soiled cuff. What other recollections came upon
                  her I know not; but she suddenly grew quite white, shivered, and listened with a
                  beating heart, and her hand upon the door. Then she stepped to the mirror, and
                  half fearfully, half curiously, parted with her fingers the braids of her blonde
                  hair above her little pink ear, until she came upon an ugly, half-healed scar. She
                  gazed at this, moving her pretty head up and down to get a better light upon it,
                  until the slight cast in her velvety eyes became very strongly marked indeed. Then
                  she turned away with a light, reckless, foolish laugh, and ran to the closet where
                  hung her precious dresses. These she inspected nervously, and missing suddenly a
                  favorite black silk from its accustomed peg, for a moment, thought she should have
                  fainted. But discovering it the next instant lying upon a trunk where she had
                  thrown it, a feeling of thankfulness to a superior Being who protects the
                  friendless, for the first time sincerely thrilled her. Then, albeit she was
                  hurried for time, she could not resist trying the effect of a certain lavender
                  neck-ribbon upon the dress she was then wearing, before the mirror. And then
                  suddenly she became aware of a child's voice close beside her, and she stopped.
                  And then the child's voice repeated, "Is it mamma?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Tretherick faced quickly about. Standing in the doorway was a little girl of
                  six or seven. Her dress had been originally fine, but was torn and dirty; and her
                  hair, which was a very violent red, was tumbled serio-comically about her
                  forehead. For all this, she was a picturesque little thing, even through whose
                  childish timidity there was a certain self-sustained air which is apt to come upon
                  children who are left much to themselves. She was holding under her arm a rag
                  doll, apparently of her own workmanship, and nearly as large as herself,—a doll
                  with a cylindrical head, and features roughly indicated with charcoal. A<pb
                     n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6648-00000108"/> long shawl, evidently belonging to a
                  grown person, dropped from her shoulders, and swept the floor.</p>
               <p>The spectacle did not excite Mrs. Tretherick's delight. Perhaps she had but a
                  small sense of humor. Certainly, when the child, still standing in the doorway,
                  again asked, "Is it mamma?" she answered sharply, "No, it isn't," and turned a
                  severe look upon the intruder.</p>
               <p>The child retreated a step, and then, gaining courage with the distance, said in
                  deliciously imperfect speech,—</p>
               <p>"Dow 'way then! why don't you dow away?"</p>
               <p>But Mrs. Tretherick was eying the shawl. Suddenly she whipped it off the child's
                  shoulders, and said angrily,—</p>
               <p>"How dared you take my things, you bad child?"</p>
               <p>"Is it yours? Then you are my mamma; ain't you? You are mamma!" she continued
                  gleefully; and, before Mrs. Tretherick could avoid her, she had dropped her doll,
                  and, catching the woman's skirts with both hands, was dancing up and down before
                  her.</p>
               <p>"What's your name, child?" said Mrs. Tretherick coldly, removing the small and not
                  very white hands from her garments.</p>
               <p>"Tarry."</p>
               <p>"Tarry?"</p>
               <p>"Yeth. Tarry. Tarowline."</p>
               <p>"Caroline?"</p>
               <p>"Yeth. Tarowline Tretherick."</p>
               <p>"Whose child <emph>are</emph> you?" demanded Mrs. Tretherick still more coldly, to
                  keep down a rising fear.</p>
               <p>"Why, yours," said the little creature with a laugh. "I'm your little durl. You're
                  my mamma, my new mamma. Don't you know my ole mamma's dorn away, never to tum back
                  any more? I don't live wid my ol' mamma now. I live wid you and papa."</p>
               <p>"How long have you been here?" asked Mrs. Tretherick snappishly.</p>
               <p>"I fink it's free days," said Carry reflectively.</p>
               <p>"You think! Don't you know?" sneered Mrs. Tretherick. "Then, where did you come
                  from?"</p>
               <p>Carry's lip began to work under this sharp cross-examination. With a great effort
                  and a small gulp, she got the better of it, and answered,—</p>
               <p>"Papa, papa fetched me,—from Miss Simmons—from Sacramento, last week."</p>
               <p>"Last week! You said three days just now," returned Mrs Tretherick with severe
                  deliberation.</p>
               <p>"I mean a monf," said Carry, now utterly adrift in sheer helplessness and
                  confusion.</p>
               <pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6648-00000109"/>
               <p>"Do you know what you are talking about?" demanded Mrs. Tretherick shrilly,
                  restraining an impulse to shake the little figure before her, and precipitate the
                  truth by specific gravity.</p>
               <p>But the flaming red head here suddenly disappeared in the folds of Mrs.
                  Tretherick's dress, as if it were trying to extinguish itself forever.</p>
               <p>"There now—stop that sniffling," said Mrs. Tretherick, extricating her dress from
                  the moist embraces of the child, and feeling exceedingly uncomfortable. "Wipe your
                  face now, and run away, and don't bother. Stop," she continued, as Carry moved
                  away. "Where's your papa?"</p>
               <p>"He's dorn away too. He's sick. He's been dorn"—she hesitated—"two, free,
                  days."</p>
               <p>"Who takes care of you, child?" said Mrs. Tretherick, eying her curiously.</p>
               <p>"John, the Chinaman. I tresses myselth. John tooks and makes the beds."</p>
               <p>"Well, now, run away and behave yourself, and don't bother me any more," said Mrs.
                  Tretherick, remembering the object of her visit. "Stop—where are you going?" she
                  added, as the child began to ascend the stairs, dragging the long doll after her
                  by one helpless leg.</p>
               <p>"Doin up stairs to play and be dood, and not bother mamma."</p>
               <p>"I ain't your mamma," shouted Mrs. Tretherick ick, and then she swiftly re-entered
                  her bedroom, and slammed the door.</p>
               <p>Once inside, she drew forth a large trunk from the closet, and set to work with
                  querulous and fretful haste to pack her wardrobe. She tore her best dress in
                  taking it from the hook on which it hung: she scratched her soft hands twice with
                  an ambushed pin. All the while, she kept up an indignant commentary on the events
                  of the past few moments. She said to herself she saw it all. Tretherick had sent
                  for this child of his first wife—this child of whose existence he had never seemed
                  to care—just to insult her, to fill her place. Doubtless the first wife herself
                  would follow soon, or perhaps there would be a third. Red hair, not auburn, but
                     <emph>red</emph>,—of course the child, this Caroline, looked like its mother,
                  and, if so, she was any thing but pretty. Or the whole thing had been prepared:
                  this red-haired child, the image of its mother, had been kept at a convenient
                  distance at Sacramento, ready to be sent for when needed. She remembered his
                  occasional visits there on—business, as he said. Perhaps the mother already was
                  there; but no, she had gone East. Nevertheless, Mrs. Tretherick, in her then state
                  of mind, preferred to dwell upon the fact that she might be there. She was dimly
                  conscious, also, of a certain satisfaction<pb n="214-215"
                     xml:id="VAC6648-00000110"/> in exaggerating her feelings. Surely no woman had
                  ever been so shamefully abused. In fancy, she sketched a picture of herself
                  sitting alone and deserted, at sunset, among the fallen columns of a ruined
                  temple, in a melancholy yet graceful attitude, while her husband drove rapidly
                  away in a luxurious coach-and-four, with a red-haired woman at his side. Sitting
                  upon the trunk she had just packed, she partly composed a lugubrious poem,
                  describing her sufferings, as, wandering alone, and poorly clad, she came upon her
                  husband and "another" flaunting in silks and diamonds. She pictured herself dying
                  of consumption, brought on by sorrow,—a beautiful wreck, yet still fascinating,
                  gazed upon adoringly by the editor of "The Avalanche," and Col. Starbottle. And
                  where was Col. Starbottle all this while? Why didn't he come? He, at least,
                  understood her. He—she laughed the reckless, light laugh of a few moments before;
                  and then her face suddenly grew grave, as it had not a few moments before.</p>
               <p>What was that little red-haired imp doing all this time? Why was she so quiet? She
                  opened the door noiselessly, and listened. She fancied that she heard, above the
                  multitudinous small noises and creakings and warpings of the vacant house, a
                  smaller voice singing on the floor above. This, as she remembered, was only an
                  open attic that had been used as a storeroom. With a half-guilty consciousness,
                  she crept softly up stairs, and, pushing the door partly open, looked within.</p>
               <p>Athwart the long, low-studded attic, a slant sunbeam from a single small window
                  lay, filled with dancing motes, and only half illuminating the barren, dreary
                  apartment. In the ray of this sunbeam she saw the child's glowing hair, as if
                  crowned by a red aureola, as she sat upon the floor with her exaggerated doll
                  between her knees. She appeared to be talking to it; and it was not long before
                  Mrs. Tretherick observed that she was rehearsing the interview of a half-hour
                  before. She catechised the doll severely, cross-examining it in regard to the
                  duration of its stay there, and generally on the measure of time. The imitation of
                  Mrs. Tretherick's manner was exceedingly successful, and the conversation almost a
                  literal reproduction, with a single exception. After she had informed the doll
                  that she was not her mother, at the close of the interview she added pathetically,
                  "that if she was dood, very dood, she might be her mamma, and love her very
                  much."</p>
               <p>I have already hinted that Mrs. Tretherick was deficient in a sense of humor.
                  Perhaps it was for this reason that this whole scene affected her most
                  unpleasantly; and the conclusion<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6648-00000111"/>
                  clusion sent the blood tingling to her cheek. There was something, too,
                  inconceivably lonely in the situation. The unfurnished vacant room, the
                  half-lights, the monstrous doll, whose very size seemed to give a pathetic
                  significance to its speechlessness, the smallness of the one animate, self-centred
                  figure,—all these touched more or less deeply the half-poetic sensibilities of the
                  woman. She could not help utilizing the impression as she stood there, and thought
                  what a fine poem might be constructed from this material, if the room were a
                  little darker, the child lonelier,—say, sitting beside a dead mother's bier, and
                  the wind wailing in the turrets. And then she suddenly heard footsteps at the door
                  below, and recognized the tread of the colonel's cane.</p>
               <p>She flew swiftly down the stairs, and encountered the colonel in the hall. Here
                  she poured into his astonished ear a voluble and exaggerated statement of her
                  discovery, and indignant recital of her wrongs. "Don't tell me the whole thing
                  wasn't arranged beforehand; for I know it was!" she almost screamed. "And think,"
                  she added, "of the heartlessness of the wretch, leaving his own child alone here
                  in that way."</p>
               <p>"It's a blank shame!" stammered the colonel without the least idea of what he was
                  talking about. In fact, utterly unable as he was to comprehend a reason for the
                  woman's excitement with his estimate of her character, I fear he showed it more
                  plainly than he intended. He stammered, expanded his chest, looked stern, gallant,
                  tender, but all unintelligently. Mrs. Tretherick, for an instant, experienced a
                  sickening doubt of the existence of natures in perfect affinity.</p>
               <p>"It's of no use," said Mrs. Tretherick with sudden vehemence, in answer to some
                  inaudible remark of the colonel's, and withdrawing her hand from the fervent grasp
                  of that ardent and sympathetic man. "It's of no use: my mind is made up. You can
                  send for my trunk as soon as you like; but I shall stay here, and confront that
                  man with the proof of his vileness. I will put him face to face with his
                  infamy."</p>
               <p>I do not know whether Col. Starbottle thoroughly appreciated the convincing proof
                  of Tretherick's unfaithfulness and malignity afforded by the damning evidence of
                  the existence of Tretherick's own child in his own house. He was dimly aware,
                  however, of some unforeseen obstacle to the perfect expression of the infinite
                  longing of his own sentimental nature. But, before he could say any thing, Carry
                  appeared on the landing above them, looking timidly, and yet half-critically at
                  the pair.</p>
               <pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6648-00000112"/>
               <p>"That's her," said Mrs. Tretherick excitedly. In her deepest emotions, either in
                  verse or prose, she rose above a consideration of grammatical construction.</p>
               <p>"Ah!" said the colonel, with a sudden assumption of parental affection and
                  jocularity that was glaringly unreal and affected. "Ah! pretty little girl, pretty
                  little girl! How do you do? How are you? You find yourself pretty well, do you,
                  pretty little girl?" The colonel's impulse also was to expand his chest, and swing
                  his cane, until it occurred to him that this action might be ineffective with a
                  child of six or seven. Carry, however, took no immediate notice of this advance,
                  but further discomposed the chivalrous colonel by running quickly to Mrs.
                  Tretherick, and hiding herself, as if for protection, in the folds of her gown.
                  Nevertheless, the colonel was not vanquished. Falling back into an attitude of
                  respectful admiration, he pointed out a marvellous resemblance to the "Madonna and
                  Child." Mrs. Tretherick simpered, but did not dislodge Carry as before. There was
                  an awkward pause for a moment; and then Mrs. Tretherick, motioning significantly
                  to the child, said in a whisper, "Go now. Don't come here again, but meet me
                  to-night at the hotel." She extended her hand: the colonel bent over it gallantly,
                  and, raising his hat, the next moment was gone.</p>
               <p>"Do you think," said Mrs. Tretherick with an embarrassed voice and a prodigious
                  blush, looking down, and addressing the fiery curls just visible in the folds of
                  her dress,—"do you think you will be 'dood,' if I let you stay in here and sit
                  with me?"</p>
               <p>"And let me tall you mamma?" queried Carry, looking up.</p>
               <p>"And let you call me mamma!" assented Mrs. Tretherick with an embarrassed
                  laugh.</p>
               <p>"Yeth," said Carry promptly.</p>
               <p>They entered the bedroom together. Carry's eye instantly caught sight of the
                  trunk.</p>
               <p>"Are you dowin away adain, mamma?" she said with a quick nervous look, and a
                  clutch at the woman's dress.</p>
               <p>"No-o," said Mrs. Tretherick, looking out of the window.</p>
               <p>"Only playing your dowin away," suggested Carry with a laugh. "Let me play
                  too."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Tretherick assented. Carry flew into the next room, and presently
                  re-appeared, dragging a small trunk, into which she gravely proceeded to pack her
                  clothes. Mrs. Tretherick noticed that they were not many. A question or two
                  regarding them brought out some further replies from the child; and, before many
                  minutes had elapsed, Mrs. Tretherick was in possession of all her earlier history.
                  But, to do this, Mrs.<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6648-00000113"/> Tretherick had
                  been obliged to take Carry upon her lap, pending the most confidential
                  disclosures. They sat thus a long time after Mrs. Tretherick had apparently ceased
                  to be interested in Carry's disclosures; and, when lost in thought, she allowed
                  the child to rattle on unheeded, and ran her fingers through the scarlet
                  curls.</p>
               <p>"You don't hold me right, mamma," said Carry at last, after one or two uneasy
                  shiftings of position.</p>
               <p>"How should I hold you?" asked Mrs. Tretherick with a half-amused,
                  half-embarrassed laugh.</p>
               <p>"Dis way," said Carry, curling up into position, with one arm around Mrs.
                  Tretherick's neck, and her cheek resting on her bosom,—"dis way,—dere." After a
                  little preparatory nestling, not unlike some small animal, she closed her eyes,
                  and went to sleep.</p>
               <p>For a few moments the woman sat silent, scarcely daring to breathe in that
                  artificial attitude. And then, whether from some occult sympathy in the touch, or
                  God best knows what, a sudden fancy began to thrill her. She began by remembering
                  an old pain that she had forgotten, an old horror that she had resolutely put away
                  all these years. She recalled days of sickness and distrust,—days of an
                  overshadowing fear,—days of preparation for something that was to be prevented,
                  that <emph>was</emph> prevented, with mortal agony and fear. She thought of a life
                  that might have been,—she dared not say <emph>had</emph> been,—and wondered. It
                  was six years ago: if it had lived, it would have been as old as Carry. The arms
                  which were folded loosely around the sleeping child began to tremble, and tighten
                  their clasp. And then the deep potential impulse came, and with a half-sob,
                  half-sigh, she threw her arms out, and drew the body of the sleeping child down,
                  down, into her breast, down again and again as if she would hide it in the grave
                  dug there years before. And the gust that shook her passed, and then, ah me! the
                  rain.</p>
               <p>A drop or two fell upon the curls of Carry, and she moved uneasily in her sleep.
                  But the woman soothed her again,—it was <emph>so</emph> easy to do it now,—and
                  they sat there quiet and undisturbed, so quiet that they might have seemed
                  incorporate of the lonely silent house, the slowly-declining sunbeams, and the
                  general air of desertion and abandonment, yet a desertion that had in it nothing
                  of age, decay, or despair.</p>
               <p>Col. Starbottle waited at the Fiddletown Hotel all that night in vain. And the
                  next morning, when Mr. Tretherick returned to his husks,<pb n="222-223"
                     xml:id="VAC6648-00000114"/> he found the house vacant and untenanted, except by
                  motes and sunbeams.</p>
               <p>When it was fairly known that Mrs. Tretherick had run away, taking Mr.
                  Tretherick's own child with her, there was some excitement, and much diversity of
                  opinion, in Fiddletown. "The Dutch Flat Intelligencer" openly alluded to the
                  "forcible abduction" of the child with the same freedom, and it is to be feared
                  the same prejudice, with which it had criticised the abductor's poetry. All of
                  Mrs. Tretherick's own sex, and perhaps a few of the opposite sex, whose
                  distinctive quality was not, however, very strongly indicated, fully coincided in
                  the views of "The Intelligencer." The majority, however, evaded the moral issue:
                  that Mrs. Tretherick had shaken the red dust of Fiddletown from her dainty
                  slippers was enough for them to know. They mourned the loss of the fair abductor
                  more than her offence. They promptly rejected Tretherick as an injured husband and
                  disconsolate father, and even went so far as to openly cast discredit on the
                  sincerity of his grief. They reserved an ironical condolence for Col. Starbottle,
                  overbearing that excellent man with untimely and demonstrative sympathy in
                  bar-rooms, saloons, and other localities not generally deemed favorable to the
                  display of sentiment. "She was alliz a skittish thing, kernel," said one
                  sympathizer, with a fine affectation of gloomy concern, and great readiness of
                  illustration; "and it's kinder nat'ril thet she'd get away some day, and stampede
                  that theer colt: but thet she should shake <emph>you</emph>, kernel, thet she
                  should just shake you—is what gits me. And they do say thet you jist hung around
                  thet hotel all night, and payrolled them corriders, and histed yourself up and
                  down them stairs, and meandered in and out o' thet piazzy, and all for nothing?"
                  It was another generous and tenderly commiserating spirit that poured additional
                  oil and wine on the colonel's wounds. "The boys yer let on thet Mrs. Tretherick
                  prevailed on ye to pack her trunk and a baby over from the house to the
                  stage-offis, and that the chap ez did go off with her thanked you, and offered you
                  two short bits, and sed ez how he liked your looks, and ud employ you agin—and now
                  you say it ain't so? Well, I'll tell the boys it aint so, and I'm glad I met you,
                  for stories <emph>do</emph> get round."</p>
               <p>Happily for Mrs. Tretherick's reputation, however, the Chinaman in Tretherick's
                  employment, who was the only eye-witness of her flight, stated that she was
                  unaccompanied, except by the child. He further deposed, that, obeying her orders,
                  he had stopped the Sacramento coach, and secured a passage for herself<pb
                     n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6648-00000115"/> and child to San Francisco. It was true
                  that Ah Fe's testimony was of no legal value. But nobody doubted it. Even those
                  who were sceptical of the Pagan's ability to recognize the sacredness of the truth
                  admitted his passionless, unprejudiced unconcern. But it would appear, from a
                  hitherto unrecorded passage of this veracious chronicle, that herein they were
                  mistaken.</p>
               <p>It was about six months after the disappearance of Mrs. Tretherick, that Ah Fe,
                  while working in Tretherick's lot, was hailed by two passing Chinamen. They were
                  the ordinary mining coolies, equipped with long poles and baskets for their usual
                  pilgrimages. An animated conversation at once ensued between Ah Fe and his brother
                  Mongolians,—a conversation characterized by that usual shrill volubility and
                  apparent animosity which was at once the delight and scorn of the intelligent
                  Caucasian who did not understand a word of it. Such, at least, was the feeling
                  with which Mr. Tretherick on his veranda, and Col. Starbottle who was passing,
                  regarded their heathenish jargon. The gallant colonel simply kicked them out of
                  his way: the irate Tretherick, with an oath, threw a stone at the group, and
                  dispersed them, but not before one or two slips of yellow rice-paper, marked with
                  hieroglyphics, were exchanged changed, and a small parcel put into Ah Fe's hands.
                  When Ah Fe opened this in the dim solitude of his kitchen, he found a little
                  girl's apron, freshly washed, ironed, and folded. On the corner of the hem were
                  the initials "C. T." Ah Fe tucked it away in a corner of his blouse, and proceeded
                  to wash his dishes in the sink with a smile of guileless satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Two days after this, Ah Fe confronted his master. "Me no likee Fiddletown. Me
                  belly sick. Me go now." Mr. Tretherick violently suggested a profane locality. Ah
                  Fe gazed at him placidly, and withdrew.</p>
               <p>Before leaving Fiddletown, however, he accidentally met Col. Starbottle, and
                  dropped a few incoherent phrases which apparently interested that gentleman. When
                  he concluded, the colonel handed him a letter and a twenty-dollar gold-piece. "If
                  you bring me an answer, I'll double that—Sabe, John?" Ah Fe nodded. An interview
                  equally accidental, with precisely the same result, took place between Ah Fe and
                  another gentleman, whom I suspect to have been the youthful editor of "The
                  Avalanche." Yet I regret to state, that, after proceeding some distance on his
                  journey, Ah Fe calmly broke the seals of both letters, and, after trying to read
                  them upside down and sideways, finally divided them into accurate squares, and in
                     this<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6648-00000116"/> condition disposed of them to a
                  brother Celestial whom he met on the road, for a trifling gratuity. The agony of
                  Col. Starbottle on finding his wash-bill made out on the unwritten side of one of
                  these squares, and delivered to him with his weekly clean clothes, and the
                  subsequent discovery that the remaining portions of his letter were circulated by
                  the same method from the Chinese laundry of one Fung Ti of Fiddletown, has been
                  described to me as peculiarly affecting. Yet I am satisfied that a higher nature,
                  rising above the levity induced by the mere contemplation of the insignificant
                  details of this breach of trust, would find ample retributive justice in the
                  difficulties that subsequently attended Ah Fe's pilgrimage.</p>
               <p>On the road to Sacramento he was twice playfully thrown from the top of the
                  stage-coach by an intelligent but deeply-intoxicated Caucasian, whose moral nature
                  was shocked at riding with one addicted to opium-smoking. At Hangtown he was
                  beaten by a passing stranger,—purely an act of Christian supererogation. At Dutch
                  Flat he was robbed by well-known hands from unknown motives. At Sacramento he was
                  arrested on suspicion of being something or other, and discharged with a severe
                  reprimand—possibly for not being it, and so delaying the course of justice. At San
                  Francisco he was freely stoned by children of the public schools; but, by
                  carefully avoiding these monuments of enlightened progress, he at last reached, in
                  comparative safety, the Chinese quarters, where his abuse was confined to the
                  police, and limited by the strong arm of the law.</p>
               <p>The next day he entered the wash-house of Chy Fook as an assistant, and on the
                  following Friday was sent with a basket of clean clothes to Chy Fook's several
                  clients.</p>
               <p>It was the usual foggy afternoon as he climbed the long wind-swept hill of
                  California Street,—one of those bleak, gray intervals that made the summer a
                  misnomer to any but the liveliest San-Franciscan fancy. There was no warmth or
                  color in earth or sky, no light nor shade within or without, only one monotonous,
                  universal neutral tint over every thing. There was a fierce unrest in the
                  wind-whipped streets: there was a dreary vacant quiet in the gray houses. When Ah
                  Fe reached the top of the hill, the Mission Ridge was already hidden; and the
                  chill sea-breeze made him shiver. As he put down his basket to rest himself, it is
                  possible, that, to his defective intelligence and heathen experience, this "God's
                  own climate," as it was called, seemed to possess but scant tenderness, softness,
                  or mercy. But it is possible that Ah Fe illogically confounded this season with
                     his<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6648-00000117"/> old persecutors, the
                  school-children, who, being released from studious confinement, at this hour were
                  generally most aggressive. So he hastened on, and, turning a corner, at last
                  stopped before a small house.</p>
               <p>It was the usual San-Franciscan urban cottage. There was the little strip of cold
                  green shrubbery before it; the chilly, bare veranda, and above this, again, the
                  grim balcony, on which no one sat. Ah Fe rang the bell. A servant appeared,
                  glanced at his basket, and reluctantly admitted him, as if he were some necessary
                  domestic animal. Ah Fe silently mounted the stairs, and, entering the open door of
                  the front-chamber, put down the basket, and stood passively on the threshold.</p>
               <p>A woman, who was sitting in the cold gray light of the window, with a child in her
                  lap, rose listlessly, and came toward him. Ah Fe instantly recognized Mrs.
                  Tretherick; but not a muscle of his immobile face changed, nor did his slant eyes
                  lighten as he met her own placidly. She evidently did not recognize him as she
                  began to count the clothes. But the child, curiously examining him, suddenly
                  uttered a short, glad cry.</p>
               <p>"Why, it's John, mamma! It's our old John what we had in Fiddletown."</p>
               <p>For an instant Ah Fe's eyes and teeth electrically cally lightened. The child
                  clapped her hands, and caught at his blouse. Then he said shortly, "Me John—Ah
                  Fe—allee same. Me know you. How do?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Tretherick dropped the clothes nervously, and looked hard at Ah Fe. Wanting
                  the quick-witted instinct of affection that sharpened Carry's perception, she even
                  then could not distinguish him above his fellows. With a recollection of past
                  pain, and an obscure suspicion of impending danger, she asked him when he had left
                  Fiddletown.</p>
               <p>"Longee time. No likee Fiddletown, no likee Tlevelick. Likee San Flisco. Likee
                  washee. Likee Tally."</p>
               <p>Ah Fe's laconics pleased Mrs. Tretherick. She did not stop to consider how much an
                  imperfect knowledge of English added to his curt directness and sincerity. But she
                  said, "Don't tell anybody you have seen me," and took out her pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Ah Fe, without looking at it, saw that it was nearly empty. Ah Fe, without
                  examining the apartment, saw that it was scantily furnished. Ah Fe, without
                  removing his eyes from blank vacancy, saw that both Mrs. Tretherick and Carry were
                  poorly dressed. Yet it is my duty to state that Ah Fe's long fingers closed
                  promptly and firmly over the half-dollar which Mrs. Tretherick extended to
                  him.</p>
               <pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6648-00000118"/>
               <p>Then he began to fumble in his blouse with a series of extraordinary contortions.
                  After a few moments, he extracted from apparently no particular place a child's
                  apron, which he laid upon the basket with the remark,—</p>
               <p>"One piecee washman flagittee."</p>
               <p>Then he began anew his fumblings and contortions. At last his efforts were
                  rewarded by his producing, apparently from his right ear, a many-folded piece of
                  tissue-paper. Unwrapping this carefully, he at last disclosed two twenty-dollar
                  gold-pieces, which he handed to Mrs. Tretherick.</p>
               <p>"You leavee money top-side of blulow, Fiddletown. Me findee money. Me fetchee
                  money to you. All lightee."</p>
               <p>"But I left no money on the top of the bureau, John," said Mrs. Tretherick
                  earnestly. "There must be some mistake. It belongs to some other person. Take it
                  back, John."</p>
               <p>Ah Fe's brow darkened. He drew away from Mrs. Tretherick's extended hand, and
                  began hastily to gather up his basket.</p>
               <p>"Me no takee it back. No, no! Bimeby pleesman he catchee me. He say, 'God damn
                  thief!—catchee flowty dollar: come to jailee.' Me no takee back. You leavee money
                  top-side blulow, Fiddletown. Me fetchee money you. Me no takee back."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Tretherick hesitated. In the confusion of her flight, she <emph>might</emph>
                  have left the money in the manner he had said. In any event, she had no right to
                  jeopardize this honest Chinaman's safety by refusing it. So she said, "Very well,
                  John, I will keep it. But you must come again and see me"—here Mrs. Tretherick
                  hesitated with a new and sudden revelation of the fact that any man could wish to
                  see any other than herself—"and, and—Carry."</p>
               <p>Ah Fe's face lightened. He even uttered a short ventriloquistic laugh without
                  moving his mouth. Then shouldering his basket, he shut the door carefully, and
                  slid quietly down stairs. In the lower hall he, however, found an unexpected
                  difficulty in opening the front-door, and, after fumbling vainly at the lock for a
                  moment, looked around for some help or instruction. But the Irish handmaid who had
                  let him in was contemptuously oblivious of his needs, and did not appear.</p>
               <p>There occurred a mysterious and painful incident, which I shall simply record
                  without attempting to explain. On the hall-table a scarf, evidently the property
                  of the servant before alluded to, was lying. As Ah Fe tried the lock with one
                  hand, the other rested lightly on the table. Suddenly, and apparently of its own
                  volition, the scarf began to creep slowly<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6648-00000119"
                  /> towards Ah Fe's hand; from Ah Fe's hand it began to creep up his sleeve slowly,
                  and with an insinuating, snake-like motion; and then disappeared somewhere in the
                  recesses of his blouse. Without betraying the least interest or concern in this
                  phenomenon, Ah Fe still repeated his experiments upon the lock. A moment later the
                  tablecloth of red damask, moved by apparently the same mysterious impulse, slowly
                  gathered itself under Ah Fe's fingers, and sinuously disappeared by the same
                  hidden channel. What further mystery might have followed, I cannot say; for at
                  this moment Ah Fe discovered the secret of the lock, and was enabled to open the
                  door coincident with the sound of footsteps upon the kitchen-stairs. Ah Fe did not
                  hasten his movements, but, patiently shouldering his basket, closed the door
                  carefully behind him again, and stepped forth into the thick encompassing fog that
                  now shrouded earth and sky.</p>
               <p>From her high casement-window, Mrs. Tretherick watched Ah Fe's figure until it
                  disappeared in the gray cloud. In her present loneliness, she felt a keen sense of
                  gratitude toward him, and may have ascribed to the higher emotions and the
                  consciousness of a good deed, that certain expansiveness of the chest, and
                  swelling of the bosom, that was really due to the hidden presence of the scarf and
                  tablecloth under his blouse. For Mrs. Tretherick was still poetically sensitive.
                  As the gray fog deepened into night, she drew Carry closer towards her, and, above
                  the prattle of the child, pursued a vein of sentimental and egotistic recollection
                  at once bitter and dangerous. The sudden apparition of Ah Fe linked her again with
                  her past life at Fiddletown. Over the dreary interval between, she was now
                  wandering,—a journey so piteous, wilful, thorny, and useless, that it was no
                  wonder that at last Carry stopped suddenly in the midst of her voluble confidences
                  to throw her small arms around the woman's neck, and bid her not to cry.</p>
               <p>Heaven forefend that I should use a pen that should be ever dedicated to an
                  exposition of unalterable moral principle to transcribe Mrs. Tretherick's own
                  theory of this interval and episode, with its feeble palliations, its illogical
                  deductions, its fond excuses, and weak apologies. It would seem, however, that her
                  experience had been hard. Her slender stock of money was soon exhausted. At
                  Sacramento she found that the composition of verse, although appealing to the
                  highest emotions of the human heart, and compelling the editorial breast to the
                  noblest commendation in the editorial pages, was singularly<pb n="234-235"
                     xml:id="VAC6648-00000120"/> larly inadequate to defray the expenses of herself
                  and Carry. Then she tried the stage, but failed signally. Possibly her conception
                  of the passions was different from that which obtained with a Sacramento audience;
                  but it was certain that her charming presence, so effective at short range, was
                  not sufficiently pronounced for the footlights. She had admirers enough in the
                  green-room, but awakened no abiding affection among the audience. In this strait,
                  it occurred to her that she had a voice,—a contralto of no very great compass or
                  cultivation, but singularly sweet and touching; and she finally obtained position
                  in a church-choir. She held it for three months, greatly to her pecuniary
                  advantage, and, it is said, much to the satisfaction of the gentlemen in the
                  back-pews, who faced toward her during the singing of the last hymn.</p>
               <p>I remember her quite distinctly at this time. The light that slanted through the
                  oriel of St. Dives choir was wont to fall very tenderly on her beautiful head with
                  its stacked masses of deerskin-colored hair, on the low black arches of her brows,
                  and to deepen the pretty fringes that shaded her eyes of Genoa velvet. Very
                  pleasant it was to watch the opening and shutting of that small straight mouth,
                  with its quick revelation of little white teeth, and to see the foolish blood
                  faintly deepen her satin cheek as you watched. For Mrs. Tretherick was very
                  sweetly conscious of admiration, and, like most pretty women, gathered herself
                  under your eye like a racer under the spur.</p>
               <p>And then, of course, there came trouble. I have it from the soprano,—a little lady
                  who possessed even more than the usual unprejudiced judgment of her sex,—that Mrs.
                  Tretherick's conduct was simply shameful; that her conceit was unbearable; that,
                  if she considered the rest of the choir as slaves, she (the soprano) would like to
                  know it; that her conduct on Easter Sunday with the basso had attracted the
                  attention of the whole congregation; and that she herself had noticed Dr. Cope
                  twice look up during the service; that her (the soprano's) friends had objected to
                  her singing in the choir with a person who had been on the stage, but she had
                  waived this. Yet she had it from the best authority that Mrs. Tretherick had run
                  away from her husband, and that this red-haired child who sometimes came in the
                  choir was not her own. The tenor confided to me behind the organ, that Mrs.
                  Tretherick had a way of sustaining a note at the end of a line in order that her
                  voice might linger longer with the congregation,—an act that could be attributed
                  only to a defective moral nature; that as a man<pb n="236-237"
                     xml:id="VAC6648-00000121"/> (he was a very popular dry-goods clerk on
                  week-days, and sang a good deal from apparently behind his eyebrows on the
                  sabbath)—that as a man, sir, he would put up with it no longer. The basso alone—a
                  short German with a heavy voice, for which he seemed reluctantly responsible, and
                  rather grieved at its possession—stood up for Mrs. Tretherick, and averred that
                  they were jealous of her because she was "bretty." The climax was at last reached
                  in an open quarrel, wherein Mrs. Tretherick used her tongue with such precision of
                  statement and epithet, that the soprano burst into hysterical tears, and had to be
                  supported from the choir by her husband and the tenor. This act was marked
                  intentionally to the congregation by the omission of the usual soprano solo. Mrs.
                  Tretherick went home flushed with triumph, but on reaching her room frantically
                  told Carry that they were beggars henceforward; that she—her mother—had just taken
                  the very bread out of her darling's mouth, and ended by bursting into a flood of
                  penitent tears. They did not come so quickly as in her old poetical days; but when
                  they came they stung deeply. She was roused by a formal visit from a
                  vestryman,—one of the music committee. Mrs. Tretherick dried her long lashes, put
                  on a new neck-ribbon, and went down to the parlor. She staid there two hours,—a
                  fact that might have occasioned some remark, but that the vestryman was married,
                  and had a family of grown-up daughters. When Mrs. Tretherick returned to her room,
                  she sang to herself in the glass and scolded Carry—but she retained her place in
                  the choir.</p>
               <p>It was not long, however. In due course of time, her enemies received a powerful
                  addition to their forces in the committee-man's wife. That lady called upon
                  several of the church-members and on Dr. Cope's family. The result was, that, at a
                  later meeting of the music committee, Mrs. Tretherick's voice was declared
                  inadequate to the size of the building and she was invited to resign. She did so.
                  She had been out of a situation for two months, and her scant means were almost
                  exhausted, when Ah Fe's unexpected treasure was tossed into her lap.</p>
               <p>The gray fog deepened into night, and the street-lamps started into shivering
                  life, as, absorbed in these unprofitable memories, Mrs. Tretherick still sat
                  drearily at her window. Even Carry had slipped away unnoticed; and her abrupt
                  entrance with the damp evening paper in her hand roused Mrs. Tretherick, and
                  brought her back to an active realization of the present. For Mrs. Tretherick was
                  wont to scan the advertisements in the faint hope of finding some avenue of
                  employment—she knew not<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6648-00000122"/> what—open to
                  her needs; and Carry had noted this habit.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Tretherick mechanically closed the shutters, lit the lights, and opened the
                  paper. Her eye fell instinctively on the following paragraph in the telegraphic
                  column:— <q>
                     <p>"FIDDLETOWN, 7th.—Mr. James Tretherick, an old resident of this place, died
                        last night of delirium tremens. Mr. Tretherick was addicted to intemperate
                        habits, said to have been induced by domestic trouble."</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. Tretherick did not start. She quietly turned over another page of the paper,
                  and glanced at Carry. The child was absorbed in a book. Mrs. Tretherick uttered no
                  word, but, during the remainder of the evening, was unusually silent and cold.
                  When Carry was undressed and in bed, Mrs. Tretherick suddenly dropped on her knees
                  beside the bed, and, taking Carry's flaming head between her hands, said,—</p>
               <p>"Should you like to have another papa, Carry darling?"</p>
               <p>"No," said Carry, after a moment's thought.</p>
               <p>"But a papa to help mamma take care of you, to love you, to give you nice clothes,
                  to make a lady of you when you grow up?"</p>
               <p>Carry turned her sleepy eyes toward the questioner. "Should <emph>you</emph>,
                  mamma?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Tretherick suddenly flushed to the roots of her hair. "Go to sleep," she said
                  sharply, and turned away.</p>
               <p>But at midnight the child felt two white arms close tightly around her, and was
                  drawn down into a bosom that heaved, fluttered, and at last was broken up by
                  sobs.</p>
               <p>"Don't ky, mamma," whispered Carry, with a vague retrospect of their recent
                  conversation. "Don't ky. I fink I <emph>should</emph> like a new papa, if he loved
                  you very much—very, very much!"</p>
               <p>A month afterward, to everybody's astonishment, Mrs. Tretherick was married. The
                  happy bridegroom was one Col. Starbottle, recently elected to represent Calaveras
                  County in the legislative councils of the State. As I cannot record the event in
                  finer language than that used by the correspondent of "The Sacramento Globe," I
                  venture to quote some of his graceful periods. "The relentless shafts of the sly
                  god have been lately busy among our gallant Solons. We quote 'one more
                  unfortunate.' The latest victim is the Hon. C. Starbottle of Calaveras. The fair
                  enchantress in the case is a beautiful widow, a former votary of Thespis, and
                  lately a fascinating St. Cecilia of one of the most fashionable churches of San
                  Francisco, where she commanded a high salary."</p>
               <p>"The Dutch Flat Intelligencer" saw fit,<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6648-00000123"/>
                  however, to comment upon the fact with that humorous freedom characteristic of an
                  unfettered press. "The new Democratic war-horse from Calaveras has lately advented
                  in the legislature with a little bill to change the name of Tretherick to
                  Starbottle. They call it a marriage-certificate down there. Mr. Tretherick has
                  been dead just one month; but we presume the gallant colonel is not afraid of
                  ghosts." It is but just to Mrs. Tretherick to state that the colonel's victory was
                  by no means an easy one. To a natural degree of coyness on the part of the lady
                  was added the impediment of a rival,—a prosperous undertaker from Sacramento, who
                  had first seen and loved Mrs. Tretherick at the theatre and church; his
                  professional habits debarring him from ordinary social intercourse, and indeed any
                  other than the most formal public contact with the sex. As this gentleman had made
                  a snug fortune during the felicitous prevalence of a severe epidemic, the colonel
                  regarded him as a dangerous rival. Fortunately, however, the undertaker was called
                  in professionally to lay out a brother-senator, who had unhappily fallen by the
                  colonel's pistol in an affair of honor; and either deterred by physical
                  consideration from rivalry, or wisely concluding that the colonel was
                  professionally valuable, he withdrew from the field.</p>
               <p>The honeymoon was brief, and brought to a close by an untoward incident. During
                  their bridal-trip, Carry had been placed in the charge of Col. Starbottle's
                  sister. On their return to the city, immediately on reaching their lodgings, Mrs.
                  Starbottle announced her intention of at once proceeding to Mrs. Culpepper's to
                  bring the child home. Col. Starbottle, who had been exhibiting for some time a
                  certain uneasiness which he had endeavored to overcome by repeated stimulation,
                  finally buttoned his coat tightly across his breast, and, after walking unsteadily
                  once or twice up and down the room, suddenly faced his wife with his most imposing
                  manner.</p>
               <p>"I have deferred," said the colonel with an exaggeration of port that increased
                  with his inward fear, and a growing thickness of speech.—"I have deferr—I may say
                  poshponed statement o' fack thash my duty ter dishclose ter ye. I did no wish to
                  mar sushine mushal happ'ness, to bligh bud o' promise, to darken conjuglar sky by

                  gone!"</p>
               <p>"Gone!" echoed Mrs. Starbottle.</p>
               <p>There was something in the tone of her voice, in the sudden drawing-together of
                  the pupils of her eyes, that for a moment nearly sobered the colonel, and partly
                  collapsed his chest.</p>
               <pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6648-00000124"/>
               <p>"I'll splain all in a minit," he said with a deprecating wave of the hand. "Every
                  thing shall be splained. The-the-the-melencholly event wish preshipitate our
                  happ'ness—the myster'us prov'nice wish releash you—releash chile!

               <p>"Where is she?" said Mrs. Starbottle with a very white face and a very low
                  voice.</p>
               <p>"I'll splain all. Chile b'long to 'ts mother. Thash law. I'm lawyer, leshlator,
                  and American sis'n. Ish my duty as lawyer, as leshlator, and 'merikan sis'n to

               <p>"Where is she?" repeated Mrs. Starbottle with her eyes still fixed on the
                  colonel's face.</p>
               <p>"Gone to 'ts m'o'r. Gone East on shteamer, yesserday. Waffed by fav'rin gales to
                  suff'rin p'rent. Thash so!"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Starbottle did not move. The colonel felt his chest slowly collapsing, but
                  steadied himself against a chair, and endeavored to beam with chivalrous gallantry
                  not unmixed with magisterial firmness upon her as she sat.</p>
               <p>"Your feelin's, m'm, do honor to yer sex, but conshider situashun. Conshider
                  m'or's feelings—conshider <emph>my</emph> feelin's." The colonel paused, and,
                  flourishing a white handkerchief, placed it negligently in his breast, and then
                  smiled tenderly above it, as over laces and ruffles, on the woman before him. "Why
                  should dark shedder cass bligh on two sholes with single beat? Chile's fine chile,
                  good chile, but summonelse chile! Chile's gone, Clar'; but all ish'n't gone,
                  Clar'. Conshider dearesht, you all's have me!"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Starbottle started to her feet. "<emph>You!</emph>" she cried, bringing out a
                  chest note that made the chandeliers ring,—"YOU that I married to give my darling
                  food and clothes,—<emph>you!</emph> a dog that I whistled to my side to keep the
                  men off me,—<emph>you!</emph>"</p>
               <p>She choked up, and then dashed past him into the inner room, which had been
                  Carry's; then she swept by him again into her own bedroom, and then suddenly
                  re-appeared before him, erect, menacing, with a burning fire over her cheek-bones,
                  a quick straightening of her arched brows and mouth, a squaring of jaw, and
                  ophidian flattening of the head.</p>
               <p>"Listen!" she said in a hoarse, half-grown boy's voice. "Hear me! If you ever
                  expect to set eyes on me again, you must find the child. If you ever expect to
                  speak to me again, to<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6648-00000125"/> touch me, you
                  must bring her back. For where she goes, I go: you hear me! Where she has gone,
                  look for me."</p>
               <p>She struck out past him again with a quick feminine throwing-out of her arms from
                  the elbows down, as if freeing herself from some imaginary bonds, and, dashing
                  into her chamber, slammed and locked the door. Col. Starbottle, although no
                  coward, stood in superstitious fear of an angry woman, and, recoiling as she swept
                  by, lost his unsteady foothold, and rolled helplessly on the sofa. Here, after one
                  or two unsuccessful attempts to regain his foothold, he remained, uttering from
                  time to time profane but not entirely coherent or intelligible protests, until at
                  last he succumbed to the exhausting quality of his emotions, and the narcotic
                  quantity of his potations.</p>
               <p>Meantime, within, Mrs. Starbottle was excitedly gathering her valuables, and
                  packing her trunk, even as she had done once before in the course of this
                  remarkable history. Perhaps some recollection of this was in her mind; for she
                  stopped to lean her burning cheeks upon her hand, as if she saw again the figure
                  of the child standing in the doorway, and heard once more a childish voice asking,
                  "Is it mamma?" But the epithet now stung her to the quick; and with a quick,
                  passionate gesture she dashed it away with a tear that had gathered in her eye.
                  And then it chanced, that, in turning over some clothes, she came upon the child's
                  slipper with a broken sandal-string. She uttered a great cry here,—the first she
                  had uttered,—and caught it to her breast, kissing it passionately again and again,
                  and rocking from side to side with a motion peculiar to her sex. And then she took
                  it to the window, the better to see it through her now streaming eyes. Here she
                  was taken with a sudden fit of coughing that she could not stifle with the
                  handkerchief she put to her feverish lips. And then she suddenly grew very faint.
                  The window seemed to recede before her, the floor to sink beneath her feet; and,
                  staggering to the bed, she fell prone upon it with the sandal and handkerchief
                  pressed to her breast. Her face was quite pale, the orbit of her eyes dark; and
                  there was a spot upon her lip, another on her handkerchief, and still another on
                  the white counterpane of the bed.</p>
               <p>The wind had risen, rattling the window-sashes, and swaying the white curtains in
                  a ghostly way. Later, a gray fog stole softly over the roofs, soothing the
                  wind-roughened surfaces, and inwrapping all things in an uncertain light and a
                  measureless peace. She lay there very quiet—for all her troubles, still a<pb
                     n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6648-00000126"/> very pretty bride. And on the other
                  side of the bolted door the gallant bridegroom, from his temporary couch, snored
                  peacefully.</p>
               <p>A week before Christmas Day, 1870, the little town of Genoa, in the State of New
                  York, exhibited, perhaps more strongly than at any other time, the bitter irony of
                  its founders and sponsors. A driving snow-storm, that had whitened every windward
                  hedge, bush, wall, and telegraph-pole, played around this soft Italian Capitol,
                  whirled in and out of the great staring wooden Doric columns of its post-office
                  and hotel, beat upon the cold green shutters of its best houses, and powdered the
                  angular, stiff, dark figures in its streets. From the level of the street, the
                  four principal churches of the town stood out starkly, even while their misshapen
                  spires were kindly hidden in the low, driving storm. Near the railroad-station,
                  the new Methodist chapel, whose resemblance to an enormous locomotive was further
                  heightened by the addition of a pyramidal row of front-steps, like a cowcatcher,
                  stood as if waiting for a few more houses to be hitched on to proceed to a
                  pleasanter location. But the pride of Genoa—the great Crammer Institute for Young
                  Ladies—stretched its bare brick length, and reared its cupola plainly from the
                  bleak Parnassian hill above the principal avenue. There was no evasion in the
                  Crammer Institute of the fact that it was a public institution. A visitor upon its
                  doorsteps, a pretty face at its window, were clearly visible all over the
                  township.</p>
               <p>The shriek of the engine of the four-o'clock Northern express brought but few of
                  the usual loungers to the depot. Only a single passenger alighted, and was driven
                  away in the solitary waiting sleigh toward the Genoa Hotel. And then the train
                  sped away again, with that passionless indifference to human sympathies or
                  curiosity peculiar to express-trains; the one baggage-truck was wheeled into the
                  station again; the station-door was locked; and the station-master went home.</p>
               <p>The locomotive-whistle, however, awakened the guilty consciousness of three young
                  ladies of the Crammer Institute, who were even then surreptitiously regaling
                  themselves in the bake-shop and confectionery-saloon of Mistress Phillips in a
                  by-lane. For even the admirable regulations of the Institute failed to entirely
                  develop the physical and moral natures of its pupils. They conformed to the
                  excellent dietary rules in public, and in private drew upon the luxurious rations
                  of their village caterer. They attended church with exemplary formality, and
                  flirted informally during service with the village<pb n="248-249"
                     xml:id="VAC6648-00000127"/> beaux. They received the best and most judicious
                  instruction during school-hours, and devoured the trashiest novels during recess.
                  The result of which was an aggregation of quite healthy, quite human, and very
                  charming young creatures, that reflected infinite credit on the Institute. Even
                  Mistress Phillips, to whom they owed vast sums, exhilarated by the exuberant
                  spirits and youthful freshness of her guests, declared that the sight of "them
                  young things" did her good; and had even been known to shield them by shameless
                  equivocation.</p>
               <p>"Four o'clock, girls! and, if we're not back to prayers by five, we'll be missed,"
                  said the tallest of these foolish virgins, with an aquiline nose, and certain
                  quiet <foreign xml:lang="FRA">élan</foreign> that bespoke the leader, as she rose
                  from her seat. "Have you got the books, Addy?" Addy displayed three
                  dissipated-looking novels under her waterproof. "And the provisions, Carry?" Carry
                  showed a suspicious parcel filling the pocket of her sack. "All right, then. Come
                  girls, trudge.—Charge it," she added, nodding to her host as they passed toward
                  the door. "I'll pay you when my quarter's allowance comes."</p>
               <p>"No, Kate," interposed Carry, producing her purse, "let me pay: it's my turn."</p>
               <p>"Never!" said Kate, arching her black brows loftily, "even if you do have rich
                  relatives, and regular remittances from California. Never!—Come, girls, forward,
                  march!"</p>
               <p>As they opened the door, a gust of wind nearly took them off their feet.
                  Kind-hearted Mrs. Phillips was alarmed. "Sakes alive, galls! ye mussn't go out in
                  sich weather. Better let me send word to the Institoot, and make ye up a nice bed
                  to-night in my parlor." But the last sentence was lost in a chorus of
                  half-suppressed shrieks, as the girls, hand in hand, ran down the steps into the
                  storm, and were at once whirled away.</p>
               <p>The short December day, unlit by any sunset glow, was failing fast. It was quite
                  dark already; and the air was thick with driving snow. For some distance their
                  high spirits, youth, and even inexperience, kept them bravely up; but, in
                  ambitiously attempting a short-cut from the high-road across an open field, their
                  strength gave out, the laugh grew less frequent, and tears began to stand in
                  Carry's brown eyes. When they reached the road again, they were utterly exhausted.
                  "Let us go back," said Carry.</p>
               <p>"We'd never get across that field again," said Addy.</p>
               <p>"Let's stop at the first house, then," said Carry.</p>
               <p>"The first house," said Addy, peering through<pb n="250-251"
                     xml:id="VAC6648-00000128"/> the gathering darkness, "is Squire Robinson's." She
                  darted a mischievous glance at Carry, that, even in her discomfort and fear,
                  brought the quick blood to her cheek.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes!" said Kate with gloomy irony, "certainly; stop at the squire's by all
                  means, and be invited to tea, and be driven home after tea by your dear friend Mr.
                  Harry, with a formal apology from Mrs. Robinson, and hopes that the young ladies
                  may be excused this time. No!" continued Kate with sudden energy. "That may suit
                     <emph>you</emph>; but I'm going back as I came,—by the window, or not at all."
                  Then she pounced suddenly, like a hawk, on Carry, who was betraying a tendency to
                  sit down on a snowbank, and whimper, and shook her briskly. "You'll be going to
                  sleep next. Stay, hold your tongues, all of you,—what's that?"</p>
               <p>It was the sound of sleigh-bells. Coming down toward them out of the darkness was
                  a sleigh with a single occupant. "Hold down your heads, girls: if it's anybody
                  that knows us, we're lost." But it was not; for a voice strange to their ears, but
                  withal very kindly and pleasant, asked if its owner could be of any help to them.
                  As they turned toward him, they saw it was a man wrapped in a handsome sealskin
                  cloak, wearing a sealskin cap; his face, half concealed by a muffler of the same
                  material, disclosing only a pair of long mustaches, and two keen dark eyes. "It's
                  a son of old Santa Claus!" whispered Addy. The girls tittered audibly as they
                  tumbled into the sleigh: they had regained their former spirits. "Where shall I
                  take you?" said the stranger quietly. There was a hurried whispering; and then
                  Kate said boldly, "To the Institute." They drove silently up the hill, until the
                  long, ascetic building loomed up before them. The stranger reined up suddenly.
                  "You know the way better than I," he said. "Where do you go in?"—"Through the
                  back-window," said Kate with sudden and appalling frankness. "I see!" responded
                  their strange driver quietly, and, alighting quickly, removed the bells from the
                  horses. "We can drive as near as you please now," he added by way of explanation.
                  "He certainly is a son of Santa Claus," whispered Addy. "Hadn't we better ask
                  after his father?" "Hush!" said Kate decidedly. "He is an angel, I dare say. "She
                  added with a delicious irrelevance, which was, however, perfectly understood by
                  her feminine auditors, "We are looking like three frights."</p>
               <p>Cautiously skirting the fences, they at last pulled up a few feet from a dark
                  wall. The stranger proceeded to assist them to alight. There was still some light
                  from the reflected<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6648-00000129"/> snow; and, as he
                  handed his fair companions to the ground, each was conscious of undergoing an
                  intense though respectful scrutiny. He assisted them gravely to open the window,
                  and then discreetly retired to the sleigh until the difficult and somewhat
                  discomposing ingress was made. He then walked to the window. "Thank you and
                  good-night!" whispered three voices. A single figure still lingered. The stranger
                  leaned over the window-sill. "Will you permit me to light my cigar here? it might
                  attract attention if I struck a match outside." By the upspringing light he saw
                  the figure of Kate very charmingly framed in by the window. The match burnt slowly
                  out in his fingers. Kate smiled mischievously. The astute young woman had detected
                  the pitiable subterfuge. For what else did she stand at the head of her class, and
                  had doting parents paid three years' tuition?</p>
               <p>The storm had passed, and the sun was shining quite cheerily in the eastern
                  recitation-room the next morning, when Miss Kate, whose seat was nearest the
                  window, placing her hand pathetically upon her heart, affected to fall in bashful
                  and extreme agitation upon the shoulder of Carry her neighbor. "<emph>He</emph>
                  has come," she gasped in a thrilling whisper. "Who?" asked Carry sympathetically,
                  who never clearly understood when Kate was in earnest. "Who?— why, the man who
                  rescued us last night! I saw him drive to the door this moment. Don't speak: I
                  shall be better in a moment—there!" she said; and the shameless hypocrite passed
                  her hand pathetically across her forehead with a tragic air.</p>
               <p>"What can he want?" asked Carry, whose curiosity was excited.</p>
               <p>"I don't know," said Kate, suddenly relapsing into gloomy cynicism. "Possibly to
                  put his five daughters to school; perhaps to finish his young wife, and warn her
                  against US."</p>
               <p>"He didn't look old, and he didn't seem like a married man," rejoined Addy
                  thoughtfully.</p>
               <p>"That was his art, you poor creature!" returned Kate scornfully. "You can never
                  tell any thing of these men, they are so deceitful. Besides, it's just my
                  fate!"</p>
               <p>"Why, Kate," began Carry, in serious concern.</p>
               <p>"Hush! Miss Walker is saying something," said Kate, laughing.</p>
               <p>"The young ladies will please give attention," said a slow, perfunctory voice.
                  "Miss Carry Tretherick is wanted in the parlor."</p>
               <p>Meantime Mr. Jack Prince, the name given on the card, and various letters and
                  credentials submitted to the Rev. Mr. Crammer, paced the somewhat severe apartment
                  known publicly as<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6648-00000130"/> the "reception
                  parlor," and privately to the pupils as "purgatory." His keen eyes had taken in
                  the various rigid details, from the flat steam "radiator," like an enormous
                  japanned soda-cracker, that heated one end of the room, to the monumental bust of
                  Dr. Crammer, that hopelessly chilled the other; from the Lord's Prayer, executed
                  by a former writing-master in such gratuitous variety of elegant calligraphic
                  trifling as to considerably abate the serious value of the composition, to three
                  views of Genoa from the Institute, which nobody ever recognized, taken on the spot
                  by the drawing-teacher; from two illuminated texts of Scripture in an English
                  letter, so gratuitously and hideously remote as to chill all human interest, to a
                  large photograph of the senior class, in which the prettiest girls were Ethiopian
                  in complexion, and sat, apparently, on each other's heads and shoulders. His
                  fingers had turned listlessly the leaves of school-catalogues, the "Sermons" of
                  Dr. Crammer, the "Poems" of Henry Kirke White, the "Lays of the Sanctuary" and
                  "Lives of Celebrated Women." His fancy, and it was a nervously active one, had
                  gone over the partings and greetings that must have taken place here, and wondered
                  why the apartment had yet caught so little of the flavor of humanity; indeed, I am
                  afraid he had almost forgotten the object of his visit, when the door opened, and
                  Carry Tretherick stood before him.</p>
               <p>It was one of those faces he had seen the night before, prettier even than it had
                  seemed then; and yet I think he was conscious of some disappointment, without
                  knowing exactly why. Her abundant waving hair was of a guinea-golden tint, her
                  complexion of a peculiar flower-like delicacy, her brown eyes of the color of
                  seaweed in deep water. It certainly was not her beauty that disappointed him.</p>
               <p>Without possessing his sensitiveness to impression, Carry was, on her part, quite
                  as vaguely ill at ease. She saw before her one of those men whom the sex would
                  vaguely generalize as "nice," that is to say, correct in all the superficial
                  appointments of style, dress, manners and feature. Yet there was a decidedly
                  unconventional quality about him: he was totally unlike any thing or anybody that
                  she could remember; and, as the attributes of originality are often as apt to
                  alarm as to attract people, she was not entirely prepossessed in his favor.</p>
               <p>"I can hardly hope," he began pleasantly, "that you remember me. It is eleven
                  years ago, and you were a very little girl. I am afraid I cannot even claim to
                  have enjoyed that familiarity that might exist <choice>
                     <sic>beween</sic>
                     <corr>between</corr>
                  </choice> a child of six and a young man of twenty-one. I don't<pb n="256-257"
                     xml:id="VAC6648-00000131"/> think I was fond of children. But I knew your
                  mother very well. I was editor of 'The Avalanche' in Fiddletown, when she took you
                  to San Francisco."</p>
               <p>"You mean my stepmother: she wasn't my mother, you know," interposed Carry
                  hastily.</p>
               <p>Mr. Prince looked at her curiously. "I mean your stepmother," he said gravely. "I
                  never had the pleasure of meeting your mother."</p>
               <p>"No: <emph>mother</emph> hasn't been in California these twelve years."</p>
               <p>There was an intentional emphasizing of the title and of its distinction, that
                  began to coldly interest Prince after his first astonishment was past.</p>
               <p>"As I come from your stepmother now," he went on with a slight laugh, "I must ask
                  you to go back for a few moments to that point. After your father's death, your
                  mother—I mean your stepmother—recognized the fact that your mother, the first Mrs.
                  Tretherick, was legally and morally your guardian, and, although much against her
                  inclination and affections, placed you again in her charge."</p>
               <p>"My stepmother married again within a month after father died, and sent me home,"
                  said Carry with great directness, and the faintest toss of her head.</p>
               <p>Mr. Prince smiled so sweetly, and apparently so sympathetically, that Carry began
                  to like him. With no other notice of the interruption he went on, "After your
                  stepmother had performed this act of simple justice, she entered into an agreement
                  with your mother to defray the expenses of your education until your eighteenth
                  year, when you were to elect and choose which of the two should thereafter be your
                  guardian, and with whom you would make your home. This agreement, I think, you are
                  already aware of, and, I believe, knew at the time."</p>
               <p>"I was a mere child then," said Carry.</p>
               <p>"Certainly," said Mr. Prince, with the same smile. "Still the conditions, I think,
                  have never been oppressive to you nor your mother; and the only time they are
                  likely to give you the least uneasiness will be when you come to make up your mind
                  in the choice of your guardian. That will be on your eighteenth birthday,—the
                  20th, I think, of the present month."</p>
               <p>Carry was silent.</p>
               <p>"Pray do not think that I am here to receive your decision, even if it be already
                  made. I only came to inform you that your stepmother, Mrs. Starbottle, will be in
                  town to-morrow, and will pass a few days at the hotel. If it is your wish to see
                  her before you make up your mind,<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6648-00000132"/> she
                  will be glad to meet you. She does not, however, wish to do any thing to influence
                  your judgment."</p>
               <p>"Does mother know she is coming?" said Carry hastily.</p>
               <p>"I do not know," said Prince gravely. "I only know, that, if you conclude to see
                  Mrs. Starbottle, it will be with your mother's permission. Mrs. Starbottle will
                  keep sacredly this part of the agreement, made ten years ago. But her health is
                  very poor; and the change and country quiet of a few days may benefit her." Mr.
                  Prince bent his keen, bright eyes upon the young girl, and almost held his breath
                  until she spoke again.</p>
               <p>"Mother's coming up to-day or to-morrow," she said, looking up.</p>
               <p>"Ah!" said Mr. Prince with a sweet and languid smile.</p>
               <p>"Is Col. Starbottle here too?" asked Carry, after a pause.</p>
               <p>"Col. Starbottle is dead. Your stepmother is again a widow."</p>
               <p>"Dead!" repeated Carry.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Mr. Prince. "Your stepmother has been singularly unfortunate in
                  surviving her affections."</p>
               <p>Carry did not know what he meant, and looked so. Mr. Prince smiled
                  re-assuringly.</p>
               <p>Presently Carry began to whimper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Prince softly stepped beside her chair.</p>
               <p>"I am afraid," he said with a very peculiar light in his eye, and a singular
                  dropping of the corners of his mustache,—"I am afraid you are taking this too
                  deeply. It will be some days before you are called upon to make a decision. Let us
                  talk of something else. I hope you caught no cold last evening."</p>
               <p>Carry's face shone out again in dimples.</p>
               <p>"You must have thought us so queer! It was too bad to give you so much
                  trouble."</p>
               <p>"None, whatever, I assure you. My sense of propriety, "he added demurely, "which
                  might have been outraged, had I been called upon to help three young ladies out of
                  a schoolroom window at night, was deeply gratified at being able to assist them in
                  again." The door-bell rang loudly, and Mr. Prince rose. "Take your own time, and
                  think well before you make your decision." But Carry's ear and attention were
                  given to the sound of voices in the hall. At the same moment, the door was thrown
                  open, and a servant announced, "Mrs. Tretherick and Mr. Robinson."</p>
               <p>The afternoon train had just shrieked out its usual indignant protest at stopping
                  at Genoa at all, as Mr. Jack Prince entered the outskirts of the town, and drove
                  towards his hotel. He was<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6648-00000133"/> wearied and
                  cynical. A drive of a dozen miles through unpicturesque outlying villages, past
                  small economic farmhouses, and hideous villas that violated his fastidious taste,
                  had, I fear, left that gentleman in a captious state of mind. He would have even
                  avoided his taciturn landlord as he drove up to the door; but that functionary
                  waylaid him on the steps. "There's a lady in the sittin'-room, waitin' for ye."
                  Mr. Prince hurried up stairs, and entered the room as Mrs. Starbottle flew towards
                  him.</p>
               <p>She had changed sadly in the last ten years. Her figure was wasted to half its
                  size. The beautiful curves of her bust and shoulders were broken or inverted. The
                  once full, rounded arm was shrunken in its sleeve; and the golden hoops that
                  encircled her wan wrists almost slipped from her hands as her long, scant fingers
                  closed convulsively around Jack's. Her cheek-bones were painted that afternoon
                  with the hectic of fever: somewhere in the hollows of those cheeks were buried the
                  dimples of long ago; but their graves were forgotten. Her lustrous eyes were still
                  beautiful, though the orbits were deeper than before. Her mouth was still sweet,
                  although the lips parted more easily over the little teeth, and even in breathing,
                  and showed more of them than she was wont to do before. The glory of her blonde
                  hair was still left: it was finer, more silken and ethereal, yet it failed even in
                  its plenitude to cover the hollows of the blue-veined temples.</p>
               <p>"Clara!" said Jack reproachfully.</p>
               <p>"Oh, forgive me, Jack!" she said, falling into a chair, but still clinging to his
                  hand,—"forgive me, dear; but I could not wait longer. I should have died,
                  Jack,—died before another night. Bear with me a little longer (it will not be
                  long), but let me stay. I may not see her, I know; I shall not speak to her: but
                  it's so sweet to feel that I am at last near her, that I breathe the same air with
                  my darling. I am better already, Jack, I am indeed. And you have seen her to-day?
                  How did she look? What did she say? Tell me all, every thing, Jack. Was she
                  beautiful? They say she is. Has she grown? Would you have known her again? Will
                  she come, Jack? Perhaps she has been here already; perhaps," she had risen with
                  tremulous excitement, and was glancing at the door,—"perhaps she is here now. Why
                  don't you speak, Jack? Tell me all."</p>
               <p>The keen eyes that looked down into hers were glistening with an infinite
                  tenderness that none, perhaps, but she would have deemed them capable of. "Clara,"
                  he said gently and cheerily, "try and compose yourself. You are trembling now with
                  the fatigue and excitement<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6648-00000134"/> of your
                  journey. I have seen Carry: she is well and beautiful. Let that suffice you
                  now."</p>
               <p>His gentle firmness composed and calmed her now, as it had often done before.
                  Stroking her thin hand, he said, after a pause, "Did Carry ever write to you?"</p>
               <p>"Twice, thanking me for some presents. They were only school-girl letters," she
                  added, nervously answering the interrogation of his eyes.</p>
               <p>"Did she ever know of your own troubles? of your poverty, of the sacrifices you
                  made to pay her bills, of your pawning your clothes and jewels, of your"—</p>
               <p>"No, no!" interrupted the woman quickly: "no! How could she? I have no enemy cruel
                  enough to tell her that."</p>
               <p>"But if she—or if Mrs. Tretherick—had heard of it? If Carry thought you were poor,
                  and unable to support her properly, it might influence her decision. Young girls
                  are fond of the position that wealth can give. She may have rich friends, maybe a
                  lover."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Starbottle winced at the last sentence. "But," she said eagerly, grasping
                  Jack's hand, "when you found me sick and helpless at Sacramento, when you—God
                  bless you for it, Jack!—offered to help me to the East, you said you knew of
                  something, you had some plan, that would make me and Carry independent."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Jack hastily; "but I want you to get strong and well first. And, now
                  that you are calmer, you shall listen to my visit to the school."</p>
               <p>It was then that Mr. Jack Prince proceeded to describe the interview already
                  recorded, with a singular felicity and discretion that shames my own account of
                  that proceeding. Without suppressing a single fact, without omitting a word or
                  detail, he yet managed to throw a poetic veil over that prosaic episode, to invest
                  the heroine with a romantic roseate atmosphere, which, though not perhaps entirely
                  imaginary, still, I fear, exhibited that genius which ten years ago had made the
                  columns of "The Fiddletown Avalanche" at once fascinating and instructive. It was
                  not until he saw the heightening color, and heard the quick breathing, of his
                  eager listener, that he felt a pang of self-reproach. "God help her and forgive
                  me!" he muttered between his clinched teeth; "but how can I tell her
                     <emph>all</emph> now!"</p>
               <p>That night, when Mrs. Starbottle laid her weary head upon her pillow, she tried to
                  picture to herself Carry at the same moment sleeping peacefully in the great
                  schoolhouse on the hill; and it was a rare comfort to this yearning, foolish woman
                  to know that she was so near. But at this moment Carry was sitting on the<pb
                     n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6648-00000135"/> edge of her bed, half undressed,
                  pouting her pretty lips, and twisting her long, leonine locks between her fingers,
                  as Miss Kate Van Corlear—dramatically wrapped in a long white counterpane, her
                  black eyes sparkling, and her thorough-bred nose thrown high in air,—stood over
                  her like a wrathful and indignant ghost; for Carry had that evening imparted her
                  woes and her history to Miss Kate, and that young lady had "proved herself no
                  friend" by falling into a state of fiery indignation over Carry's "ingratitude,"
                  and openly and shamelessly espousing the claims of Mrs. Starbottle. "Why, if the
                  half you tell me is true, your mother and those Robinsons are making of you not
                  only a little coward, but a little snob, miss. Respectability, forsooth! Look you,
                  my family are centuries before the Trethericks; but if my family had ever treated
                  me in this way, and then asked me to turn my back on my best friend, I'd whistle
                  them down the wind;" and here Kate snapped her fingers, bent her black brows, and
                  glared around the room as if in search of a recreant Van Corlear.</p>
               <p>"You just talk this way, because you have taken a fancy to that Mr. Prince," said
                  Carry.</p>
               <p>In the debasing slang of the period, that had even found its way into the virgin
                  cloisters of the Crammer Institute, Miss Kate, as she afterwards expressed it,
                  instantly "went for her."</p>
               <p>First, with a shake of her head, she threw her long black hair over one shoulder,
                  then, dropping one end of the counterpane from the other like a vestal tunic, she
                  stepped before Carry with a purposely-exaggerated classic stride. "And what if I
                  have, miss! What if I happen to know a gentleman when I see him! What if I happen
                  to know, that among a thousand such traditional, conventional, feeble editions of
                  their grandfathers as Mr. Harry Robinson, you cannot find one original,
                  independent, individualized gentleman like your Prince! Go to bed, miss, and pray
                  to Heaven that he may be <emph>your</emph> Prince indeed. Ask to have a contrite
                  and grateful heart, and thank the Lord in particular for having sent you such a
                  friend as Kate Van Corlear." Yet, after an imposing dramatic exit, she re-appeared
                  the next moment as a straight white flash, kissed Carry between the brows, and was
                  gone.</p>
               <p>The next day was a weary one to Jack Prince. He was convinced in his mind that
                  Carry would not come; yet to keep this consciousness from Mrs. Starbottle, to meet
                  her simple hopefulness with an equal degree of apparent faith, was a hard and
                  difficult task. He would have tried to divert her mind by taking her on a long
                  drive; but she was fearful that Carry might come during her absence; and her<pb
                     n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6648-00000136"/> strength, he was obliged to admit, had
                  failed greatly. As he looked into her large and awe-inspiring clear eyes, a
                  something he tried to keep from his mind—to put off day by day from
                  contemplation—kept asserting itself directly to his inner consciousness. He began
                  to doubt the expediency and wisdom of his management. He recalled every incident
                  of his interview with Carry, and half believed that its failure was due to
                  himself. Yet Mrs. Starbottle was very patient and confident: her very confidence
                  shook his faith in his own judgment. When her strength was equal to the exertion,
                  she was propped up in her chair by the window, where she could see the school and
                  the entrance to the hotel. In the intervals she would elaborate pleasant plans for
                  the future, and would sketch a country home. She had taken a strange fancy, as it
                  seemed to Prince, to the present location; but it was notable that the future,
                  always thus outlined, was one of quiet and repose. She believed she would get well
                  soon: in fact, she thought she was now much better than she had been; but it might
                  be long before she should be quite strong again. She would whisper on in this way
                  until Jack would dash madly down into the bar-room, order liquors that he did not
                  drink, light cigars that he did not smoke, talk with men that he did not listen
                  to, and behave generally as our stronger sex is apt to do in periods of delicate
                  trials and perplexity.</p>
               <p>The day closed with a clouded sky and a bitter, searching wind. With the night
                  fell a few wandering flakes of snow. She was still content and hopeful; and, as
                  Jack wheeled her from the window to the fire, she explained to him, how, that, as
                  the school-term was drawing near its close, Carry was probably kept closely at her
                  lessons during the day, and could only leave the school at night. So she sat up
                  the greater part of the evening, and combed her silken hair, and, as far as her
                  strength would allow, made an undress toilet to receive her guest. "We must not
                  frighten the child, Jack," she said apologetically, and with something of her old
                  coquetry.</p>
               <p>It was with a feeling of relief, that, at ten o'clock, Jack received a message
                  from the landlord, saying that the doctor would like to see him for a moment down
                  stairs. As Jack entered the grim, dimly-lighted parlor, he observed the hooded
                  figure of a woman near the fire. He was about to withdraw again, when a voice that
                  he remembered very pleasantly said,—</p>
               <p>"Oh, it's all right! I'm the doctor."</p>
               <p>The hood was thrown back; and Prince saw the shining black hair, and black,
                  audacious eyes, of Kate Van Corlear.</p>
               <pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6648-00000137"/>
               <p>"Don't ask any questions. I'm the doctor; and there's my prescription," and she
                  pointed to the half-frightened, half-sobbing Carry in the corner—"to be taken at
                  once."</p>
               <p>"Then Mrs. Tretherick has given her permission?"</p>
               <p>"Not much, if I know the sentiments of that lady," replied Kate saucily.</p>
               <p>"Then how did you get away?" asked Prince gravely.</p>
               <p>"BY THE WINDOW."</p>
               <p>When Mr. Prince had left Carry in the arms of her stepmother, he returned to the
                  parlor.</p>
               <p>"Well?" demanded Kate.</p>
               <p>"She will stay—<emph>you</emph> will, I hope, also—tonight."</p>
               <p>"As I shall not be eighteen, and my own mistress on the 20th, and as I haven't a
                  sick stepmother, I won't."</p>
               <p>"Then you will give me the pleasure of seeing you safely through the window
                  again?"</p>
               <p>When Mr. Prince returned an hour later, he found Carry sitting on a low stool at
                  Mrs. Starbottle's feet. Her head was in her stepmother's lap; and she had sobbed
                  herself to sleep. Mrs. Starbottle put her finger to her lip. "I told you she would
                  come. God bless you, Jack! and good-night."</p>
               <p>The next morning Mrs. Tretherick, indignant nant, the Rev. Asa Crammer, principal,
                  injured, and Mr. Joel Robinson, sen., complacently respectable, called upon Mr.
                  Prince. There was a stormy meeting, ending in a demand for Carry. "We certainly
                  cannot admit of this interference," said Mrs. Tretherick, a fashionably dressed,
                  indistinctive looking woman. "It is several days before the expiration of our
                  agreement; and we do not feel, under the circumstances, justified in releasing
                  Mrs. Starbottle from its conditions." "Until the expiration of the school-term, we
                  must consider Miss Tretherick as complying entirely with its rules and
                  discipline," imposed Dr. Crammer. "The whole proceeding is calculated to injure
                  the prospects, and compromise the position, of Miss Tretherick in society,"
                  suggested Mr. Robinson.</p>
               <p>In vain Mr. Prince urged the failing condition of Mrs. Starbottle, her absolute
                  freedom from complicity with Carry's flight, the pardonable and natural instincts
                  of the girl, and his own assurance that they were willing to abide by her
                  decision. And then with a rising color in his cheek, a dangerous look in his eye,
                  but a singular calmness in his speech, he added,—</p>
               <p>"One word more. It becomes my duty to inform you of a circumstance which would
                  certainly justify me, as an executor of the late<pb n="270-271"
                     xml:id="VAC6648-00000138"/> Mr. Tretherick, in fully resisting your demands. A
                  few months after Mr. Tretherick's death, through the agency of a Chinaman in his
                  employment, it was discovered that he had made a will, which was subsequently
                  found among his papers. The insignificant value of his bequest—mostly land, then
                  quite valueless—prevented his executors from carrying out his wishes, or from even
                  proving the will, or making it otherwise publicly known, until within the last two
                  or three years, when the property had enormously increased in value. The
                  provisions of that bequest are simple, but unmistakable. The property is divided
                  between Carry and her stepmother, with the explicit condition that Mrs. Starbottle
                  shall become her legal guardian, provide for her education, and in all details
                  stand to her <foreign xml:lang="LAT">in loco parentis</foreign>."</p>
               <p>"What is the value of this bequest?" asked Mr. Robinson. "I cannot tell exactly,
                  but not far from half a million, I should say," returned Prince. "Certainly, with
                  this knowledge, as a friend of Miss Tretherick, I must say that her conduct is as
                  judicious as it is honorable to her," responded Mr. Robinson. "I shall not presume
                  to question the wishes, or throw any obstacles in the way of carrying out the
                  intentions, of my dead husband," added Mrs. Tretherick; and the interview was
                  closed.</p>
               <p>When its result was made known to Mrs. Starbottle, she raised Jack's hand to her
                  feverish lips. "It cannot add to <emph>my</emph> happiness now, Jack; but tell me,
                  why did you keep it from her?" Jack smiled, but did not reply.</p>
               <p>Within the next week the necessary legal formalities were concluded; and Carry was
                  restored to her stepmother. At Mrs. Starbottle's request, a small house in the
                  outskirts of the town was procured; and thither they removed to wait the spring,
                  and Mrs. Starbottle's convalescence. Both came tardily that year.</p>
               <p>Yet she was happy and patient. She was fond of watching the budding of the trees
                  beyond her window,—a novel sight to her Californian experience,—and of asking
                  Carry their names and seasons. Even at this time she projected for that summer,
                  which seemed to her so mysteriously withheld, long walks with Carry through the
                  leafy woods, whose gray, misty ranks she could see along the hilltop. She even
                  thought she could write poetry about them, and recalled the fact as evidence of
                  her gaining strength; and there is, I believe, still treasured by one of the
                  members of this little household a little carol so joyous, so simple, and so
                  innocent, that it might have been an echo of the robin that called to her from the
                  window, as perhaps it was.</p>
               <pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6648-00000139"/>
               <p>And then, without warning, there dropped from Heaven a day so tender, so
                  mystically soft, so dreamily beautiful, so throbbing, and alive with the
                  fluttering of invisible wings, so replete and bounteously overflowing with an
                  awakening and joyous resurrection not taught by man or limited by creed, that they
                  thought it fit to bring her out, and lay her in that glorious sunshine that
                  sprinkled like the droppings of a bridal torch the happy lintels and doors. And
                  there she lay beatified and calm.</p>
               <p>Wearied by watching, Carry had fallen asleep by her side; and Mrs. Starbottle's
                  thin fingers lay like a benediction on her head. Presently she called Jack to her
                  side.</p>
               <p>"Who was that," she whispered, "who just came in?"</p>
               <p>"Miss Van Corlear," said Jack, answering the look in her great hollow eyes.</p>
               <p>"Jack," she said, after a moment's silence, "sit by me a moment, dear Jack: I've
                  something I must say. If I ever seemed hard, or cold, or coquettish to you in the
                  old days, it was because I loved you, Jack, too well to mar your future by linking
                  it with my own. I always loved you, dear Jack, even when I seemed least worthy of
                  you. That is gone now. But I had a dream lately, Jack, a foolish woman's
                  dream,—that you might find what I lacked in<emph>her</emph>", and she glanced
                  lovingly at the sleeping girl at her side; "that you might love her as you have
                  loved me. But even that is not to be, Jack, is it?" and she glanced wistfully in
                  his face. Jack pressed her hand, but did not speak. After a few moments' silence,
                  she again said, "Perhaps you are right in your choice. She is a good-hearted girl,
                  Jack—but a little bold."</p>
               <p>And with this last flicker of foolish, weak humanity in her struggling spirit, she
                  spoke no more. When they came to her a moment later, a tiny bird that had lit upon
                  her breast flew away; and the hand that they lifted from Carry's head fell
                  lifeless at her side.</p>

               <head>A JERSEY CENTENARIAN.</head>
               <p>I HAVE seen her at last. She is a hundred and seven years old, and remembers
                  George Washington quite distinctly. It is somewhat confusing, however, that she
                  also remembers a contemporaneous Josiah W. Perkins of Basking Ridge, N.J., and, I
                  think, has the impression that Perkins was the better man. Perkins, at the close
                  of the last century, paid her some little attention. There are a few things that a
                  really noble woman of a hundred and seven never forgets.</p>
               <p>It was Perkins, who said to her in 1795, in the streets of Philadelphia, "Shall I
                  show thee Gen. Washington?" Then she said careless-like (for you know, child, at
                  that time it wasn't what it is now to see Gen. Washington), she said, "So do,
                  Josiah, so do!" Then he pointed to a tall man who got out of a carriage, and went
                  into a large house. He was larger than you be. He wore his own hair—not powdered;
                  had a flowered chintz vest, with yellow breeches and blue stockings, and a
                  broad-brimmed hat. In summer he wore a white straw hat, and at his farm at Basking
                  Ridge he always wore it. At this point, it became too evident that she was
                  describing the clothes of the all-fascinating Perkins: so I gently but firmly led
                  her back to Washington. Then it appeared that she did not remember exactly what he
                  wore. To assist her, I sketched the general historic dress of that period. She
                  said she thought he was dressed like that. Emboldened by my success, I added a hat
                  of Charles II., and pointed shoes of the eleventh century. She indorsed these with
                  such cheerful alacrity, that I dropped the subject.</p>
               <p>The house upon which I had stumbled, or, rather, to which my horse—a Jersey hack,
                  accustomed to historic research—had brought me, was low and quaint. Like most old
                  houses, it had the appearance of being encroached upon by the surrounding glebe,
                  as if it were already half in the grave, with a sod or two, in the shape of moss
                  thrown on it, like ashes on ashes, and dust on dust. A wooden house, instead of
                  acquiring dignity with age, is apt to lose its youth and respectability together.
                  A porch, with scant, sloping seats, from which even the winter's snow must have
                  slid uncomfortably, projected from a doorway that opened most unjustifiably into a
                  small sitting-room. There was<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6648-00000141"/> no
                  vestibule, or <foreign xml:lang="LAT">locus pœnitentiæ</foreign>, for the
                  embarrassed or bashful visitor: he passed at once from the security of the public
                  road into shameful privacy. And here, in the mellow autumnal sunlight, that,
                  streaming through the maples and sumach on the opposite bank, flickered and danced
                  upon the floor, she sat and discoursed of George Washington, and thought of
                  Perkins. She was quite in keeping with the house and the season, albeit a little
                  in advance of both; her skin being of a faded russet, and her hands so like dead
                  November leaves, that I fancied they even rustled when she moved them.</p>
               <p>For all that, she was quite bright and cheery; her faculties still quite vigorous,
                  although performing irregularly and spasmodically. It was somewhat discomposing, I
                  confess, to observe, that at times her lower jaw would drop, leaving her
                  speechless, until one of the family would notice it, and raise it smartly into
                  place with a slight snap,—an operation always performed in such an habitual,
                  perfunctory manner, generally in passing to and fro in their household duties,
                  that it was very trying to the spectator. It was still more embarrassing to
                  observe that the dear old lady had evidently no knowledge of this, but believed
                  she was still talking, and that, on resuming her actual vocal utterance, she was
                  often abrupt and incoherent, beginning always in the middle of a sentence, and
                  often in the middle of a word. "Sometimes," said her daughter, a giddy,
                  thoughtless young thing of eighty-five,—"sometimes just moving her head sort of
                  unhitches her jaw; and, if we don't happen to see it, she'll go on talking for
                  hours without ever making a sound." Although I was convinced, after this, that
                  during my interview I had lost several important revelations regarding George.
                  Washington through these peculiar lapses, I could not help reflecting how
                  beneficent were these provisions of the Creator,—how, if properly studied and
                  applied, they might be fraught with happiness to mankind,—how a slight jostle or
                  jar at a dinner-party might make the post-prandial eloquence of garrulous senility
                  satisfactory to itself, yet harmless to others,—how a more intimate knowledge of
                  anatomy, introduced into the domestic circle, might make a home tolerable at
                  least, if not happy,—how a long-suffering husband, under the pretence of a
                  conjugal caress, might so unhook his wife's condyloid process as to allow the flow
                  of expostulation, criticism, or denunciation, to go on with gratification to her,
                  and perfect immunity to himself.</p>
               <p>But this was not getting back to George Washington and the early struggles of
                     the<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6648-00000142"/> Republic. So I returned to the
                  commander-in-chief, but found, after one or two leading questions, that she was
                  rather inclined to resent his re-appearance on the stage. Her reminiscences here
                  were chiefly social and local, and more or less flavored with Perkins. We got back
                  as far as the Revolutionary epoch, or, rather, her impressions of that epoch, when
                  it was still fresh in the public mind. And here I came upon an incident, purely
                  personal and local, but, withal, so novel, weird, and uncanny, that for a while I
                  fear it quite displaced George Washington in my mind, and tinged the autumnal
                  fields beyond with a red that was not of the sumach. I do not remember to have
                  read of it in the books. I do not know that it is entirely authentic. It was
                  attested to me by mother and daughter, as an uncontradicted tradition.</p>
               <p>In the little field beyond, where the plough still turns up musket-balls and
                  cartridge-boxes, took place one of those irregular skirmishes between the
                  militiamen and Knyphausen's stragglers, that made the retreat historical. A
                  Hessian soldier, wounded in both legs and utterly helpless, dragged himself to the
                  cover of a hazel-copse, and lay there hidden for two days. On the third day,
                  maddened by thirst, he managed to creep to the rail-fence of an adjoining
                  farmhouse house, but found himself unable to mount it or pass through. There was
                  no one in the house but a little girl of six or seven years. He called to her, and
                  in a faint voice asked for water. She returned to the house, as if to comply with
                  his request, but, mounting a chair, took from the chimney a heavily-loaded Queen
                  Anne musket, and, going to the door, took deliberate aim at the helpless intruder,
                  and fired. The man fell back dead, without a groan. She replaced the musket, and,
                  returning to the fence, covered the body with boughs and leaves, until it was
                  hidden. Two or three days after, she related the occurrence in a careless, casual
                  way, and leading the way to the fence, with a piece of bread and butter in her
                  guileless little fingers, pointed out the result of her simple, unsophisticated
                  effort. The Hessian was decently buried, but I could not find out what became of
                  the little girl. Nobody seemed to remember. I trust, that, in after-years, she was
                  happily married; that no Jersey Lovelace attempted to trifle with a heart whose
                  impulses were so prompt, and whose purposes were so sincere. They did not seem to
                  know if she had married or not. Yet it does not seem probable that such simplicity
                  of conception, frankness of expression, and deftness of execution, were lost to
                  posterity, or that they failed, in their time<pb n="280-281"
                     xml:id="VAC6648-00000143"/> and season, to give flavor to the domestic felicity
                  of the period. Beyond this, the story perhaps has little value, except as an
                  offset to the usual anecdotes of Hessian atrocity.</p>
               <p>They had their financial panics even in Jersey, in the old days. She remembered
                  when Dr. White married your cousin Mary—or was it Susan?—yes, it was Susan. She
                  remembers that your Uncle Harry brought in an armful of bank-notes,—paper money,
                  you know,—and threw them in the corner, saying they were no good to anybody. She
                  remembered playing with them, and giving them to your Aunt Anna—no, child, it was
                  your own mother, bless your heart! Some of them was marked as high as a hundred
                  dollars. Everybody kept gold and silver in a stocking, or in a "chaney" vase, like
                  that. You never used money to buy any thing. When Josiah went to Springfield to
                  buy any thing, he took a cartload of things with him to exchange. That yaller
                  picture-frame was paid for in greenings. But then people knew jest what they had.
                  They didn't fritter their substance away in unchristian trifles, like your father,
                  Eliza Jane, who doesn't know that there is a God who will smite him hip and thigh;
                  for vengeance is mine, and those that believe in me. But here, singularly enough,
                  the inferior maxillaries gave out, and her jaw dropped. (I noticed that her giddy
                  daughter of eighty-five was sitting near her; but I do not pretend to connect this
                  fact with the arrested flow of personal disclosure.) Howbeit, when she recovered
                  her speech again, it appeared that she was complaining of the weather.</p>
               <p>The seasons had changed very much since your father went to sea. The winters used
                  to be terrible in those days. When she went over to Springfield, in June, she saw
                  the snow still on Watson's Ridge. There were whole days when you couldn't git over
                  to William Henry's, their next neighbor, a quarter of a mile away. It was that
                  drefful winter that the Spanish sailor was found. You don't remember the Spanish
                  sailor, Eliza Jane—it was before your time. There was a little personal
                  skirmishing here, which I feared, at first, might end in a suspension of maxillary
                  functions, and the loss of the story; but here it is. Ah, me! it is a pure white
                  winter idyl: how shall I sing it this bright, gay autumnal day?</p>
               <p>It was a terrible night, that winter's night, when she and the century were young
                  together. The sun was lost at three o'clock: the snowy night came down like a
                  white sheet, that flapped around the house, beat at the windows with its edges,
                  and at last wrapped it in a close<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6648-00000144"/>
                  embrace. In the middle of the night, they thought they heard above the wind a
                  voice crying, "Christus, Christus!" in a foreign tongue. They opened the door,—no
                  easy task in the north wind that pressed its strong shoulders against it,—but
                  nothing was to be seen but the drifting snow. The next morning dawned on fences
                  hidden, and a landscape changed and obliterated with drift. During the day, they
                  again heard the cry of "Christus!" this time faint and hidden, like a child's
                  voice. They searched in vain: the drifted snow hid its secret. On the third day
                  they broke a path to the fence, and then they heard the cry distinctly. Digging
                  down, they found the body of a man,—a Spanish sailor, dark and bearded, with
                  ear-rings in his ears. As they stood gazing down at his cold and pulseless figure,
                  the cry of "Christus!" again rose upon the wintry air; and they turned and fled in
                  superstitious terror to the house. And then one of the children, bolder than the
                  rest, knelt down, and opened the dead man's rough pea-jacket, and found—what think
                  you?—a little blue-and-green parrot, nestling against his breast. It was the bird
                  that had echoed mechanically the last despairing cry of the life that was given to
                  save it. It was the bird, that ever after, amid outlandish oaths and wilder
                  sailor-songs, that I fear often shocked the pure ears of its gentle mistress, and
                  brought scandal into the Jerseys, still retained that one weird and mournful
                  cry.</p>
               <p>The sun meanwhile was sinking behind the steadfast range beyond, and I could not
                  help feeling that I must depart with my wants unsatisfied. I had brought away no
                  historic fragment: I absolutely knew little or nothing new regarding George
                  Washington. I had been addressed variously by the names of different members of
                  the family who were dead and forgotten; I had stood for an hour in the past: yet I
                  had not added to my historical knowledge, nor the practical benefit of your
                  readers. I spoke once more of Washington, and she replied with a reminiscence of
                  Perkins.</p>
               <p>Stand forth, O Josiah W. Perkins of Basking Ridge, N.J. Thou wast of little
                  account in thy life, I warrant; thou didst not even feel the greatness of thy day
                  and time; thou didst criticise thy superiors; thou wast small and narrow in thy
                  ways; thy very name and grave are unknown and uncared for: but thou wast once kind
                  to a woman who survived thee, and, lo! thy name is again spoken of men, and for a
                  moment lifted up above thy betters.</p>
