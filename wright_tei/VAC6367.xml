            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>AMONG the incidents at Niagara Falls, and in life on the Niagara frontier, may be
               found the material for many an interesting volume that has never been written,—facts
               that are stranger than fiction; and events, which, however exciting in themselves,
               possess additional interest from their association with one of the most romantic and
               most famous localities in the world.</p>
            <p>The traveler from every country who journeys to any foreign clime, is as sure to went
               his way to Niagara as the Arab to make his pilgrimage to Mecca. Here have come some
               of the most renowned personages; among whom have been Presidents and Princes, and the
               Queen of the Sandwich Islands. The Europeans, the South Americans, and the Japanese,
               have paid their respects to Niagara. So have ambassadors from China, with their gaudy
               costumes, and long braided hair dangling from their heads in Oriental style. And then
               a score of Indians, chiefs on their way to Washington from the region of the Rocky
               Mountains, have paused to look<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6367-00000006"/> upon the work
               of the Great Spirit, and upon the white man's bridges over the chasm! And while
               viewing the scene, with the serious gravity of the red man, have they sat in groups
               upon the banks of the river and passed round the pipe of peace, each taking a few
               puffs of tobacco smoke after their peculiar custom. Occasionally an Indian trafficker
               from some small tribe, not far away, can tell of the once renowned war-chief,
               Brandt.</p>
            <p>And some of the Senecas here remember their celebrated chief, Red Jacket, who died
               near Buffalo, N.Y., not many years ago, at the age of one hundred years. It was Red
               Jacket who said to the missionary, that the white man's religion was not necessary
               for Indians, else the Great Spirit would have sent it to their fathers!</p>
            <p>Nine miles north-east of the Falls is an Indian village of Tuscaroras, a tribe
               numbering about three hundred. Several interesting accounts of real life among this
               tribe are related by the white inhabitants near them, one of which is the true story
               of the British officer, who, many years ago, married an Indian girl of the tribe; a
               descendant of whom is now a well known Captain in the United States army. Known to
               many also, was the white missionary girl, who married a pious Indian of the tribe.
               Frequently has the visitor at the Falls gone to the Indian village and heard her
               Indian husband interpret the sermons of the white preacher. The wife of the present
               Tuscarora chief is a well educated Indian woman, and her brother is known to the
               people of the United States as a gentleman of fine accomplishments, and who served
               with distinguished ability upon the staff of Gen. Grant.</p>
            <p>The small remnant of Indians now found in this locality, seem, however, like some
               ancient relic of a mysterious race which soon will take their last look at
               Niagara.</p>
            <p>Upon this frontier, time has witnessed the important movements of armies, Indian
               massacres, and the abortive attempts of Canadian rebellions. Here the political
               fugitives of one country have crossed for safety into the other; and criminals have
               left their own country—for their country's good! And still continue the expert and
               daring operations of smugglers, and the attempts of government officials to detect
               and capture them; the secret history of which will furnish all varieties of incidents
               from the amusing to the tragical, and from plans of successful strategy to plans of
               ridiculous failure.</p>
            <p>Across this river the so-called underground-railroads once had several of their
               terminations; where fugitive slaves were landed from the United States into Canada, a
               work once secretly carried on by the anti-slavery men. Subsequently, during the great
               rebellion, the tables were turned, and the original owner in many cases became the
               fugitive, crossing the same frontier for safety where his former slaves had once fled
               before <emph>him!</emph> but could now return to the States for their year of
               jubilee!</p>
            <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6367-00000007"/>
            <p>The Niagara River is thirty-six miles in length; its course northward, and the center
               of the stream part of the boundary line between the United States and Canada. It is
               the outlet of Lake Erie, carrying the waters of the great upper lakes into Lake
               Ontario on their way to the River St. Lawrence and the Atlantic Ocean. On the shore
               of Lake Erie, at the head of the Niagara, stands the city of Buffalo, containing a
               population of one hundred and twenty thousand inhabitants, which are principally of
               English and German descent.</p>
            <p>From Lake Erie to the Falls the distance is twenty-two miles; the river in no place
               less than three-fourths of a mile in width; the banks low, and the surrounding
               country comparatively level.</p>
            <p>Five miles before reaching the Falls the little village of La Salle stands upon the
               American shore. At this place was constructed the first vessel that ever navigated
               Lake Erie or the upper lakes. It was sixty tons burden, and built in 1679, by Robert
               La Salle, a Frenchman, who, a little before this time, had established trading posts
               here and at the mouth of the river. A little below this once stood Fort Schlosser.
               Upon the opposite shore, three miles from the Falls, is the Canadian village of
               Chippewa, near which the Niagara receives the waters of Welland River, also known as
               Chippewa Creek. To these places the Niagara River is navigable. And between these
               landings and among the islands of the river the smugglers make their midnight trips
               by sail and oar, at the risk of accidents that would send them into the merciless
               rapids below, as well as at the risk of meeting customhouse officers on shore and
               river, armed with as deadly weapons as themselves.</p>
            <p>For a distance of one mile before reaching the Falls, the river—a mile in
               width—becomes grand and terrible in its swift descent; and finally, being divided at
               the edge of the fall by a wild, romantic island, the parted waters plunge on either
               side in a perpendicular descent over the end and side of a chasm one hundred and
               sixty feet in depth.</p>
            <p>The gorge of Niagara with its varied and picturesque scenery, and increasing in depth
               by the descent of its rapids, and being about one-third the width of the Falls, winds
               its way for seven miles, when there is a sudden descent of several hundred feet in
               the face of the country, forming a one-sided mountain, which stretches far away on
               either side, to the east and to the west. At the top of this mountain-side, near the
               gorge, and upon Canadian ground, stands Brock's Monument, erected in memory of the
               British General who was killed about half-way down the mountain in the battle of
               Queenston Heights, fought on the 11th of October, 1812, between the British and
               Americans. At the foot of the mountain is a small Canadian village known as
               Queenston. Upon the American side of the river, directly opposite, is the ancient
               looking village of Lewiston, once the scene of an Indian massacre, and famous in the
               history of this frontier.</p>
            <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6367-00000008"/>
            <p>From these two places the river flows in a smooth current to Lake Ontario, a distance
               of seven miles. At the mouth of the river, upon the American shore, is the old Fort
               Niagara. Directly opposite stands guard the Canadian Fort Massasauga. From Lake
               Ontario steamboats bring their passengers up the river as far as Lewiston and
               Queenston.</p>
            <p>No boat has ever attempted to ascend the rapids in the gorge. Only one instance of
               safe descent has been known, which was that of J. R. Robinson, an old resident at the
               Falls, whose daring and skill, among other good deeds of the kind, rescued Chapin in
               1839, from an island in the rapids near the brink of the Falls, below Goat Island
               bridge, and near the spot where in 1853, citizens and strangers witnessed for eight
               hours the vain attempts to rescue Avery.</p>
            <p>The village of Niagara Falls is upon the American side and has a population of four
               thousand inhabitants, besides the strangers who in summer throng its extensive hotels
               near the great cataract. It is estimated that more than one hundred thousand people
               visit this place annually. One peculiar feature of busy life near the large hotels
               and at interesting points upon the banks of the river, are the bazaars of Indians
               curiosities and geological specimens, and whatever the visitor could desire to take
               home as appropriate mementos of Niagara.</p>
            <p>Goat Island, which divides the Falls, contains sixty-one acres, and is reached from
               the American side by an iron bridge over the rapids. Immediately below the Falls the
               river in the deep chasm, is for a short distance, safely crossed in small ferry
               boats, which the visitor may reach by descending a stairway of 291 steps. At the top
               of the banks the chasm is crossed by footmen and carriages, upon one of the longest
               suspension bridges in the world; where, upon the Canada side is one of the best and
               most extensive hotels in the country, built in this rural and romantic location to
               afford its guests a front view of the whole Falls. A still better view, however, is
               obtained by approaching near where the famous Table Rock once was. Large portions of
               this rock, which projected for a great distance over the chasm, fell in 1818, 1828
               and 1850. Here, descending by a stairway into the chasm, the visitor may be safely
               guided into a cave behind the great sheet of water. The large number of visitors to
               this locality, upon the Canada side, led a gentleman of wealth and scientific taste,
               some years ago, to conceive the idea of building an extensive museum for the
               exhibition of natural and artificial objects of interest. For this purpose a fine and
               imposing stone structure was erected near Table Rock, where one of the most
               interesting and scientific collections is visited by the traveler. Another elegant
               stone building with a large observatory at its top, is built close upon the bank of
               the Canadian Fall. From this observatory the traveler obtains one of the grandest
               views of the Falls, the chasm, the rapids and the surrounding scenery.</p>
            <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6367-00000009"/>
            <p>One mile west is the battle ground of Lundy's Lane, a point of historic interest,
               where that terrible midnight contest was fought between the United States forces
               under Gen. Scott, and the British under Gen. Drummond, July 25th, 1814, twenty days
               after the battle of Chippewa.</p>
            <p>Among points of interest along the gorge of Niagara are Buttery's Rapids, the
               Whirlpool and the Devil's Hole. At the latter place, three and a half miles below the
               Falls, and upon the American side, a detachment of one hundred British soldiers, in
               1763, were surprised by a party of Seneca Indians, and all but two men, Steadman and
               Mathews, were massacred or driven to destruction over the precipice. Near Brantford
               in Canada, sixty-five miles west of the scene of this massacre, is the grave of
               Brandt, the Indian chief who led on this terrible slaughter.</p>
            <p>Across the chasm, two miles below the Falls, is the great railroad suspension bridge,
               completed in 1855, and the first of the kind ever constructed. Its magnificent and
               substantial appearance, with long trains of cars moving on its deck or upper floor,
               its net work sides, and footmen and carriages crossing on its lower floor, excite the
               wonder and admiration of every beholder. This bridge unites, in social intercourse,
               the American village of Niagara City with the Canadian village of Clifton. As
               railroad stations both places are more commonly known as Suspension Bridge. The New
               York Central Railroad being connected by this bridge to the Great Western, running
               through Canada and connecting with the Michigan Central, makes one of the most direct
               and desirable routes from New York city to Chicago and the West.</p>
            <p>And now, dear reader, having given a somewhat lengthy historical introduction to the
               locality, we offer only a word about the story:</p>
            <p>Its plot will illustrate how strangely and how secretly fortune and misfortune,
               happiness and sorrow, do sometimes come upon the realities of life, and how varied
               are the characters and the scenes in which God's designs are controlling human plans;
               from the pious contentment of Black Tom and the fisherman to the troubles of the
               dissipated Figsley; from the hypocrisy of the aristocratic Jared Bailey to the
               unsuspicious family of Deacon Sommers; from the anxieties of Miss Sommers and her
               rival lovers to the desponding Adeline and the mirthful Dinah.</p>
            <p>It is well, too, if many a reader shall receive a few hints through some of the
               characters in this book, before meeting them elsewhere.</p>
            <p>The interest and value of the story are greatly increased in the fact that some of
               the characters, especially the custom-house officers, and one of the rival lovers,
               bring to light much of the secret history of life and doings at Niagara. That this
               task might be correctly performed, the writer took occasion to become personally
               acquainted in the locality. And hence, reader, the manuscript for this book was
               written within sight of the great cataract.</p>

                     Fright—A Secret Office—Prospect of going to Niagara.</head>
                  <p>THE locality, a picturesque and fertile valley—the neighborhood, a farming
                     community; and here, a mile distant from the pleasant little village of
                     Fallington, N. Y., stood the farm-house where Mrs. Bailey had resided since the
                     death of her husband. She had grown feeble with age; and a nervousness from
                     which she had long suffered, had become much aggravated by her anxieties
                     occasioned by the war. The intended husband of her daughter Matilda had been
                     killed at the battle of Fair Oaks, and it was only by Mrs. Bailey's almost
                     frantic exertions and certain influences with the examining surgeon, that her
                     son Benjamin had been prevented, three years before this, from entering the
                     army.</p>
                  <p>Widow Bailey was patriotic, but she had a holy horror of war; and when her son
                     told her that both the Fallington ministers urged the young men to enlist, she
                     replied:</p>
                  <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6367-00000011"/>
                  <p>"Mercy on me! Benjamin; they had better read the Scriptures where it says,
                     'Thou shalt not kill!'"</p>
                  <p>When told that the South were fighting for a freedom to enslave, but the North
                     for the Union and freedom for all, without distinction of creed, or birth, or
                     color, she said:</p>
                  <p>"I know it, Benjamin; but mercy on me! the rest of the politicians, and the
                     ministers too,—if they can't settle it peaceably,—can go to the war as well as
                     I can spare you! Mercy on me! they are no better to be shot at, Benjamin, than
                     you are!"</p>
                  <p>At last, the war had reached the summer of 1864, and although its actual
                     presence was almost wholly confined to the slaveholding States, yet, in many
                     ways, its effects had been felt in every home in the North.</p>
                  <p>Of late, or rather since the fall elections, Mrs. Bailey had surmised a new
                     source of trouble: Benjamin—although he had been rejected by the examining
                     surgeon, as McLiner had contrived it for Mrs. Bailey—was becoming an active
                     politician, and had made several speeches favoring the war. She was not so
                     anxious now that politicians should do the fighting. She feared her son's
                     increasing influence in his political party might lead him to obtain a
                     captain's commission in the army; and she thought—poor, innocent soul!—that
                     captains always rushed into battle in front of their companies.</p>
                  <p>Possibly widow Bailey may have been musing upon these things, when, one
                     afternoon about the middle of July, in the year above mentioned, her thoughts
                     were interrupted by somebody rapping on the front door of her dwelling. Her
                     fingers stopped on a half taken stitch of her knitting-work, and, eager to know
                     who was the caller, she hastened to the door herself.</p>
                  <p>"Here's a telegraph dispatch for Mr. Benjamin Bailey," said a voice, which
                     began uttering the announcement an instant before Mrs. Bailey had fairly
                     observed who was the caller; for the message-boy had just begun the duties of
                     his new employment, and had been instructed by the operator that "telegraphic
                     dispatches must be dispatched with the utmost dispatch;" which tautology the
                     operator explained by adding, "or, in other words, boy, take these messages
                     quick as you can;" from all of which the idea of <emph>haste</emph> had been
                     certainly and effectually conveyed to the boy's mind and practice, whatever the
                     real practice of the operator.</p>
                  <p>"What! a telegraph for us? Why, mercy on me! Why, where is Benjamin? I wonder
                     if anything has happened—or if anybody is hurt—or what's the matter! I told him
                     so—ever since that awful dream!" said Mrs. Bailey, addressing her remarks to
                     nobody, and in a very nervous and abstracted manner; at the same time, having
                     taken the sealed message, she had turned, in search of somebody, back toward
                     the sitting room. The hasty utterance of the boy at the door had, no doubt,
                     enhanced her idea of the importance and seriousness of a telegraphic
                     dispatch.</p>
                  <p>There was something so peculiar in her manner, and in the expression of her
                     features, whenever Mrs. Bailey manifested her fears, or her astonishment, that
                     it was often difficult for strangers to avoid a smile. But on this<pb n="22-23"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000012"/> occasion the message-boy simply opened his eyes
                     and his mouth, with, intense curiosity, till her entire disappearance produced
                     in his mind a vivid recollection that he had only half finished his errand. So
                     he rapped again on the half open door for the return of the peculiar old lady
                     who had taken off the telegram without paying for it, or even expressing her
                     intentions to do so.</p>
                  <p>On hearing the knocking repeated, Mrs. Bailey immediately reappeared, saying,
                     in a confused way:</p>
                  <p>"Why, mercy on me! have you got another?"</p>
                  <p>"No, ma'am," replied the boy, in a state of increased wonderment, waiting for
                     the old lady to approach him. At the same time it was not very certain, from
                     Mrs. Bailey's movements, which way she was going; for, almost in the same
                     breath, she said—as if to whomsoever it might concern—looking this way and
                     that—</p>
                  <p>"I wonder where Benjamin <emph>is!</emph> Matilda," said she to some one who
                     was not in sight, "see if Benjamin is in the library—or, it may be he is in the
                     old shop fixin' up some liniment. Deacon Soloman was here this morning after
                     some for his rheumatis. I don't see where he went to—Benjamin seems to be
                     somewhere <emph>always!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>Finally, Mrs. Bailey, coming to the door, inquired what else the boy
                     wanted.</p>
                  <p>"Please ma'am, shall I wait for a reply to the telegraph?"</p>
                  <p>"I don't know anything about it," replied Mrs. Bailey.</p>
                  <p>"There is a dollar and forty-five cents to pay for the telegraph," said the
                     boy.</p>
                  <p>"What! a dollar and forty-five cents to pay on a letter? Mercy on me! I wonder
                     where <emph>is</emph> Benjamin!"</p>
                  <p>Again she disappeared, and had been gone only a moment, when both Mrs. Bailey
                     and the message-boy were frightened nearly out of their senses by a sudden
                     noise, occasioned, evidently, by an explosion, and instantly after the report,
                     a scream from Matilda; who, in searching for Benjamin, had just reached the
                     door of the old laboratory—a kind of liniment shop, in a small, dilapidated
                     building, at the end of the wood shed, and which, in its better days, before
                     Mrs. Bailey became a widow, had been used for the office of her husband, Dr.
                     Bailey. The instant after the explosion, Matilda opened the door, when she
                     beheld the object of her search standing with his hands to his eyes,
                     exclaiming:</p>
                  <p>"THUN-DER-A-TION!"</p>
                  <p>The room was nearly filled with smoke. Matilda feared fire—smelt gunpowder—and
                     seizing a pail partially filled with water, which was standing near her, the
                     next instant its contents were dashed against the bewildered Bailey and some
                     chemicals his ingenuity had led him to experiment with.</p>
                  <p>"Hold on there!" said he to Matilda, "it is only that thundering anvil that has
                        <emph>waked</emph> up here all at once for a little extra powder that got
                     near it—and," he continued, still rubbing his eyes, "a little witch-fire that
                     I've blundered into somehow with an infernal mixture!"</p>
                  <p>"But your eyes, Ben!—are they injured much?"</p>
                  <p>"O no; they will be all right in a few minutes—the flash came a little too near
                     them; but it seems to me you are as careless of water as if the house were on
                     fire?"</p>
                  <p>Matilda, seeing that no harm was done, went back to<pb n="24-25"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000013"/> the sitting room to report to her mother, whom
                     she found almost speechless from alarm.</p>
                  <p>The message-boy, too, from fright, had run away from the house, nearly down to
                     the front gate, where he had stopped, turned around, and stood gazing at the
                     house, every instant expecting the mystery to develop itself!</p>
                  <p>When Benjamin reached the sitting room he found his mother recovered from her
                     fright enough to exclaim:</p>
                  <p>"Mercy on me! Where was Benjamin?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, mother, it was nothing but the old anvil," explained Benjamin, "loaded
                     the same as it was on the Fourth! You know we used to call it the old
                     blacksmith's cannon, mother!"</p>
                  <p>"Mercy on me! and here 'tis the middle of July!"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, mother," interrupted Matilda, "how could we think Ben was celebrating the
                     Fourth again, so quick!"</p>
                  <p>"Mercy on me! how came you so wet, Benjamin? Just look at your coat!"</p>
                  <p>Matilda was now quite unsuccessful in attempting to subdue a hearty laugh,
                     while she humorously suggested to her brother:</p>
                  <p>"How lucky it was there was no more water in that pail!"</p>
                  <p>"Why, what do you mean?" said Mrs. Bailey, omitting her usual utterance. "How
                     was it—what is it? I can't see how the old anvil should throw water like a
                     steamboat explosion!"</p>
                  <p>"Why, mother, Matilda means that she performed a very expert performance
                     without the slightest rehearsal, by tipping over a pail of water; and that I am
                     the humble recipient of the contents of said pail—be the same more or
                     less."</p>
                  <p>"You see, mother," added Matilda, "I was trying to put out the explosion!"</p>
                  <p>"Trying to put out the explosion! Mercy on me! What <emph>do</emph> you mean? I
                     do believe you are always going to be children if you live a hundred
                     years!"</p>
                  <p>Benjamin then explained how the explosion occurred; which was substantially as
                     follows: By one of those unaccountable blunders, which even the most careful,
                     people sometimes make, the old anvil, which had been used on the Fourth as a
                     substitute for a cannon, was left loaded, and had been set on the floor near an
                     old marble table in the room where Benjamin kept a few drugs and chemicals,
                     where he occassionally mixed up a liniment or other preparation. Mrs. Bailey
                     was troubled with "corns on her feet," and Benjamin had lately heard an old
                     corn doctor, or chiropodist, tell of a mixture that was a "sure cure." As near
                     as he could remember the recipe, he had obtained the ingredients and was mixing
                     them on the old marble tablet.</p>
                  <p>"Let me see," said he to himself, "I think they were equal parts of potash,
                     lime, and sulphur—and, it seems to me, gunpowder."</p>
                  <p>So he took down from a shelf, a flask of powder, and turned out a little upon
                     the tablet. As he put up the flask the thought occurred to him that he had got
                     the idea of powder from another recipe, for a different purpose. Brushing the
                     powder aside, he then mixed about a thimbleful, each, of potash, sulphur, and
                        quick-lime;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6367-00000014"/> when, to his utter
                     astonishment, this mixture produced fire, resembling a live coal of fire mashed
                     into fine fragments. He had barely noticed the mystery when the explosion took
                     place.</p>
                  <p>"It must be," said Bailey, manifesting a kind of scientific curiosity, "that
                     the dampness of the potash made the lime become so hot as to set fire to the
                     sulphur, and a spark of it somehow got to the powder which I had brushed aside,
                     and through that communicated to the load in the anvil! At any rate," continued
                     Bailey, "I can swear, or affirm, to the way I created that fire on that marble;
                     and as for the old anvil—why, that—very evidently and very positively—has
                     spoken for itself!"</p>
                  <p>Matilda smiled, and so did Benjamin; but Mrs. Bailey did not smile—she only
                     noticed the danger; and when her son closed his explanation, she repeated her
                     usual exclamation, "Mercy on me!" And then she added:</p>
                  <p>"How venturesome!—and after all I have told you! It seems as if some folks just
                     courted danger. You would have been killed a dozen times, Benjamin, before
                     this, if you had had your own way about it! Mercy—only think of it! You would
                     have gone to the war if it had not been for the doctor who examined you, and if
                     I had not given one of his friends fifty dollars, so he would tell the truth
                     and say you were not strong enough to endure being a soldier! You didn't thank
                     me for it at the time, Benjamin; but when half the boys in the neighborhood
                     never come home again, and the rest of them come home cripples for life! you'll
                     thank your poor old mother for looking ahead a little, then! I'm as patriotic
                     as anybody, but I don't believe in wars; and I shall always be glad that
                     McLiner took the money which made the doctor tell the honest truth! for I know
                     you never could have stood it."</p>
                  <p>"Ben," said Matilda, "it seems to me these are awful times, when you have to
                     pay some men so much to keep them honest, while poor private soldiers get so
                     little for being killed. Of course you can say it is glorious to die for one's
                     country; but the Northern States would be large enough for my country, without
                     having my head blown off, or whining as Alexander did, for the privilege of
                     controlling more. And the newspapers say Horace Greeley thought so himself at
                     first."</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps he did," said Benjamin, "for it was terrible to think of war. But, at
                     last, he and almost everybody, saw that the principles of men who believe in
                     slavery are dangerous, and that two such opposites as slavery and freedom would
                     not and could not live together in peace, and freedom must conquer while it
                     could. Mr. Seward, years before this war, said no more than a simple truth in
                     reference to such antagonistic principles and interests, when he foretold the
                     people that such a conflict was 'irrepressible;' and, Matilda, do you not see
                     that freedom and slavery are natural enemies?"</p>
                  <p>Just at this moment a loud knock was again heard at the front door.</p>
                  <p>Benjamin, having already changed his coat for a dry one, proceeded to attend
                     the call.</p>
                  <p>"Mercy on me," said Mrs. Bailey, "there is that telegraph boy again! Here,
                     Benjamin! There, Matilda! what have I done with that telegraph letter?"</p>
                  <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6367-00000015"/>
                  <p>"Why, what is that in your hand?" asked Matilda.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, there it is now! Well, I'm getting <emph>so</emph> nervous and so
                     forgetful."</p>
                  <p>Benjamin, having directed the message-boy to wait a moment, returned to the
                     sitting-room, when Mrs. Bailey handed him the message, saying:</p>
                  <p>"Mercy on me! Benjamin, here is a telegraph letter! I wonder what has happened
                     for a telegraph to be sent here to us!"</p>
                  <p>Benjamin took the message, opened it and read aloud as follows:</p>

                  <p>"What appointment does that mean?" inquired widow Bailey, who, no doubt,
                     apprehended some appointment in the army.</p>
                  <p>"Wait a moment, mother," said her son, "till I settle with the boy at the
                     door."</p>
                  <p>"Yes," joined in Matilda, "for goodness' sakes! This is the third time that
                     poor boy has rapped on that door! and say, Ben, not only <emph>pay</emph> him,
                     but convince him there has been no earthquake, or any other accident worth his
                     while to alarm the villagers with!"</p>
                  <p>At last, the boy who had brought the telegram was settled with, his wonderment
                     put in a state of moderation, and he departed. Benjamin returned again to the
                     sitting-room room, where the inquiry was repeated, as to what appointment the
                     dispatch referred to.</p>
                  <p>"It is no appointment in the army," he replied. "It is a secret office to aid
                     in catching smugglers, which our friend Mr. Baldwin urged me to take, though I
                     told him I should know as little of my duty at first, as half the brigadier
                     generals do of theirs!"</p>
                  <p>"Where will you have to go?" asked Matilda.</p>
                  <p>"Smugglers!" said Mrs. Bailey at the same time. "Mercy on me, where?"</p>
                  <p>"I shall have to go to Niagara Falls, and all along the Niagara river, from
                     Lake Erie to Lake Ontario, and wherever else I should see a prospect of
                     detecting smugglers on that frontier. It is a secret office, and you must be
                     cautious even here, only to say I went west on business. You can avoid giving
                     any direct answer as to the <emph>kind</emph> of business.</p>
                  <p>"But, suppose," suggested Mrs. Bailey, "that they ask us to tell
                        <emph>what</emph> kind of business?"</p>
                  <p>"Then, tell them I said it was private business."</p>
                  <p>"That," replied Matilda, "would make them quiz all the harder!"</p>
                  <p>"No matter—keep giving the same answer—private, private business! That reply is
                     short and true; and, mother, it is easy for you to remember—private
                     business—private."</p>
                  <p>"Why, mercy! how it would look to keep giving the same answer, perhaps a half
                     dozen times to the same person. Wouldn't they get offended?"</p>
                  <p>"No—such folks would not—at least they should not," said Benjamin.</p>
                  <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6367-00000016"/>
                  <p>"That's a queer kind of office, though," said Maltilda. "For goodness sakes!
                     you would have to go right among the smugglers themselves. And from what little
                     I have read about them, I should think some of them were just as desperate as
                     robbers! They cross rivers in little boats, in stormy nights, and they try to
                     shoot everybody that attempts to catch them!"</p>
                  <p>To this Benjamin was about to reply, when his mother, who had raised both her
                     hands in astonishment, exclaimed:</p>
                  <p>"Mercy! mercy on me!"</p>
                  <p>And widow Bailey turned her face away as from some foreseen danger, her
                     complexion as white as the neat lace fringe of the cap which bordered her
                     face.</p>
                  <p>"I wouldn't think," continued Matilda, "there was any honor in such an office
                     as that!"</p>
                  <p>"My son," added Mrs. Bailey, "have you got to be such a politician as that?
                     after being brought up to go to Sunday school and to meeting, and always to
                     choose good company or none at all? Only think of it, Benjamin! being among
                     robbers as Matilda says—and being out nights in little boats—and getting
                     drowned, perhaps!"</p>
                  <p>"Mother, I think Matilda has given you too bad a picture. The office is one
                     which Judge Bailey would be glad to secure for his son David. And Mr. Baldwin
                     himself told me it is a good office; that I would be my own master, mostly; and
                     he thought it would be a very pleasant way of making acquaintance with the
                     people and the country in Canada and on the frontier. The pay, too, is four
                     dollars per day, and my expenses paid by the government ernment, and I would
                     get one-quarter of the seizures and fines which I would be the means of
                     bringing about."</p>
                  <p>"Among robbers and such folks! Mercy on me! Benjamin!"</p>
                  <p>"About all I would have to do, mother, would be to detect smugglers privately
                     and report information to the Collector of Customs. That is about all!"</p>
                  <p>"Goodness sakes, mother, how is he going to find out about such folks without
                     associating with them? just as I have read of police detectives going among all
                     kinds of rough people!"</p>
                  <p>Ah! Mr. Benjamin Bailey, while you have been flattered by the bright side, the
                     quick perceptions of a female have glanced at the other, where you will find
                     more trouble than even your sister anticipates for you.</p>

                     Letter—Trouble in Love Matters—Miss Sommers Returns to Niagara.</head>
                  <p>To Matilda's last suggestion, that Benjamin's office "would compel him to
                     associate with all kinds of rough people," widow Bailey said her usual
                     exclamation, and Benjamin made further explanations. He had been told that
                     smuggling was done by all classes of people, and with little, if any,
                     compunctions of conscience, nobody seeming to consider it disgraceful to
                     smuggle what they wanted for their own use, and speculators of course smuggling
                     as a <emph>matter of principle,</emph> believing professedly in the "principles
                     of free trade."</p>
                  <p>"Only yesterday," said Benjamin, "I had a talk with a man right from Niagara
                     Falls, and he says that a hundred thousand persons visit the Falls there every
                     season, and that it is almost a private fashion among themselves for the very
                     finest ladies to smuggle the very nicest things out of Canada, and that even
                     the Judges of the United States Courts generally let off a smuggler with a
                     light fine; so, you see," he added, "there is no reason why these novel stories
                     need make Matilda imagine that I must be among robbers and such desperate
                     fellows all the while."</p>
                  <p>"All the while!" repeated Matilda, with more of regret than rebuke in her
                     manner; "it is a bad place, Ben, to be with such fellows any of the time."</p>
                  <p>"But Mr. Baldwin is the Special Agent of the Treasury, you know, and he told me
                     the older detectives might do the rough work, and, if I did not like the
                     position, he could secure me some better office after a while."</p>
                  <p>Widow Bailey must have been somewhat satisfied by these explanations; for,
                     dropping that part of her objections, she told him that "it would be unpleasant
                     to have him so far from home, in such strange business, when he had never been
                     fifty miles from home in his life."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, mother, the business will seem strange to me; but you know people give me
                     the credit of being easy to learn, and of having a little tact at
                     management—don't they, mother?"</p>
                  <p>Of course, Mrs. Bailey was proud to admit that fact. But Matilda hoped that Ben
                     would be <emph>hard to learn</emph> of such fellows as she believed some
                     smugglers were.</p>
                  <p>"Mercy on me! Benjamin, I don't see what business you can try next! Do you ever
                     think of the old saying: 'A rolling stone gathers no moss?'"</p>
                  <p>"O, say, mother, I wish you would remind him of another old saying: 'It takes a
                     rogue to catch a rogue!' Then how can he be successful in such business without
                     becoming a rogue himself, as well as being with them?"</p>
                  <p>Matilda said this in such an amusing way that Benjamin only smiled—made no
                     reply.</p>
                  <p>"And now, brother Ben," continued Matilda, "if you won't think me too
                     bad—although I think you just as<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6367-00000018"/> firm
                     as anybody—I must say that this going into a business where you must become
                     acquainted with everything bad, makes me think of the verse that the minister
                     quoted last Sunday: <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"'Vice is a monster of such frightful mien,</l>
                           <l>As, to be hated, needs but to be seen.'"</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>"So far," interrupted Benjamin, "that is what <emph>I</emph> think; and that is
                     why <emph>I</emph> shall be safe—shall hate vice by seeing it!"</p>
                  <p>And he laughed with an evident feeling of triumph at turning her quotation to
                     his advantage. But so soon as he was ready to listen, Matilda deliberately
                     added: <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"'<hi rend="i"/>Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,</l>
                           <l>
                              <hi rend="i"/>We first endure, then pity, then embrace!'"</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>"My dear sister," said Benjamin, taking her by the hand, "the kind and earnest
                     manner in which you have quoted the last couplet, shall make me remember the
                     caution that you have so kindly intended." And here, taking the hand of his
                     good old mother, also, he continued: "And wherever my duty as a secret
                     detective shall call me, though I may be obliged to practice deception against
                     the guilty, as must be sometimes done to detect and punish crime, or to defend
                     one's country and sustain the laws which protect the innocent, I do most
                     solemnly pledge to each of you, my mother and my sister, that you shall have no
                     cause in any act of mine—though every act were known to you—for any anxiety for
                     aught else than my personal safety, and of that I will also take as good care
                     as may be consistent with duty and honor."</p>
                  <p>During this unexpected and impromptu reference to a parting, and while Benjamin
                     Bailey held in earnest grasp the hand of mother and sister, Mrs. Bailey was
                     overcome with tears, whilst the eyes of both sister and brother were glistening
                     with the same affectionate tokens.</p>
                  <p>Their hearts were too full for utterance, and not another word was spoken, as
                     Benjamin silently turned away, and repaired to the old laboratory.</p>
                  <p>As he stood again by the marble tablet, where he had mixed up such a singular
                     chemical fire, he instinctively examined to see if all was safe; though he had,
                     before leaving, carefully put out every spark which Matilda's pretty well
                     directed dash from the water pail had not extinguished.</p>
                  <p>While Bailey was here setting things in order, his thoughts were occupied about
                     his new office. He must detect smugglers without being detected himself. He
                     might not meet expectations before he would be removed from the office, as he
                     would have to learn the whole business. "It is some as Matilda says," thought
                     he. "In order to learn much, I shall have to assume the character of a smuggler
                     when among smugglers, and try to have them post me up in their operations. But
                     if anybody expects me to associate with a drinking, carousing, low set of
                     rowdies, thieves or cut-throats very much—considerably, constantly,
                     &amp;c.—they are hereby notified that I, Benjamin Bailey, of Bailey's Corners,
                     am not that kind<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6367-00000019"/> of a politician, and
                     shall not degrade the office, nor the country Baileys, to any such extent!"</p>
                  <p>"But stop; instead of talking to this old anvil, I had better go and arrange my
                     papers a little." Then, as he turned away from the marble table, he said to
                     himself: "I rather guess that corn medicine was a humbug—an
                        <emph>all-fired</emph> humbug," he added, as he thought of the singular
                     combustibles.</p>
                  <p>Bailey was soon engaged in looking over some old letters in his library. He
                     came to one addressed in a neat hand, which he looked at a moment with a sad
                     expression in his countenance; then slowly unfolding the letter, he said to
                     himself: "Yes; Laura Sommers was the best girl I ever knew."</p>
                  <p>There was a mystery about this letter which Benjamin Bailey had never yet
                     solved, although one year had passed away since he received it.</p>
                  <p>The letter read as follows:</p>

                              <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Dear Sir—You can never know how it pains my feelings
                                 to be obliged to write this letter to break off our correspondence.
                                 I thought you so manly, so good, and generous; and I enjoyed so
                                 much your intelligent and original thoughts.</p>
                              <p>"But my parents have been made to believe many things against you,
                                 and that you have very recently treated one young lady in the most
                                 dishonorable and heartless manner.</p>
                              <p>"Father has just written me to discontinue our correspondence. I
                                 will, however, take the liberty to say, that this unpleasant
                                 termination has made me very unhappy. I shall not, therefore, make
                                 my visit here, at Judge Bailey's, so long as I intended; but,
                                 having finished my visits at other places here, I will go home to
                                 Niagara Falls, in a day or two.</p>
                              <p>"O, how I wish I might <emph>know</emph> if all I have been told,
                                 and all that has been written to my father, is true! and yet they
                                 pretend it is told as a Christian duty. But I think queer, that I
                                 must be pledged not to tell what it is, nor who told me. Benjamin,
                                 I cannot believe what they say of you, and yet I don't see how I
                                 can doubt their word. When I go home, I shall ask father to give
                                 you an opportunity to prove it is <emph>not true,</emph> or to
                                 show, at least, what <emph>motive</emph> they may have to speak ill
                                 and falsely of you. Perhaps you have told some <emph>truth</emph>
                                 against them, and they are telling falsehoods secretly against you,
                                 to injure you, so that what you say may not be believed! I know a
                                 family of Vromans who always take that course to injure innocent
                                 ones whom they fear may tell some truth against them!</p>
                              <p>"But, Benjamin, I cannot disobey my parents, and hence our
                                 correspondence must cease until they are satisfied to have it
                                 renewed; yet, I am willing to wait years to see if time will
                                 explain for you, or defend you. And I remain your friend,</p>
                              <closer>
                                 <signed>"LAURA SOMMERS."</signed>

                  <p>As Benjamin Bailey looked upon this letter, which, at<pb n="38-39"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000020"/> times during the past year, had given him so
                     much unhappiness, he fell into a thoughtful and melancholy mood; and, seating
                     himself in a chair by the side of his open secretary, he again read Laura's
                     last letter.</p>
                  <p>But, ere he had finished reading it, he had paused several times, as if in deep
                     study with his own thoughts. It was plain to him that Miss Sommers had been
                     made to believe the most cruel falsehoods against him; but how the same
                     unprincipled inventors of slander could so far influence Deacon Sommers, that
                     he would decline to consider any defense from him, (which he had offered,) or,
                     so far as he knew, to investigate in any way, was a mystery he could not
                     account for.</p>
                  <p>The insinuation that he had treated some one in a dishonorable and heartless
                     manner, had not the slightest foundation in fact! Where could such base
                     falsehood originate? thought he; and what could be the motive to tempt any one
                     thus to deceive Miss Sommers and her parents? It must be, of course, some one
                     who has their confidence. It must be a consummate hypocrite, too, whose
                     depravity could secretly contrive such falsehoods, and still retain a
                     respectable hearing from Laura and her parents. It was evident, too, to
                     Benjamin, from Laura's letter, that the guilty parties had disregarded her
                     happiness as well as his own; and, could they be detected, would be despised by
                     Mr. Sommers. But they had been only too successful in their hypocrisy.</p>
                  <p>Many had been the queries which Benjamin Bailey had revolved in his mind since
                     receiving that letter. Sometimes he had wondered if the secret slander which
                     cut off communication between himself and the Sommers family had turned any
                     advantage to its wicked authors.</p>
                  <p>As Benjamin folded up Laura's letter and proceeded to arrange his papers in the
                     secretary, he had some vague impression that chance might, somehow, bring him
                     to an acquaintance with Mr. Sommers under favorable circumstances, should he
                     remain long at Niagara; but as matters now stood, he felt that he could not
                     compromise his dignity by further directly seeking to communicate with Mr.
                     Sommers.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The Country Baileys—And the Village Baileys—The Country Cousin
                     becomes a Politician—The Mistake—Social Inconsistency.</head>
                  <p>AT the time of his appointment to this office of secret detective, Benjamin
                     Bailey had reached the age of twenty-four years; and the almanacs of that year,
                     which were given away as vehicles for the circulation of various
                     advertisements, declared it to be the year of our Lord one thousand eight
                     hundred and sixty-four, or, according to a more ancient order of reckoning, as
                     handed down by King Solomon, and others further back, it was denominated the
                     year of the world five thousand eight hundred and sixty-four.</p>
                  <p>At this time if any one had inquired of the farmers in the neighborhood, as to
                     what business Benjamin Bailey followed, they would, probably, have said, if
                     they undertook to decide so puzzling a question at all, that he was about as
                     much farmer as anything else; though they would have come to this conclusion,
                     principally, because the farm he had fallen heir to, by the death of his
                     father, had a more visible and a more permanent existence than anything else he
                     had amused himself with.</p>
                  <p>There was hardly any kind of business requiring tact and head-work, which had
                     fallen under Benjamin Bailey's observation, that he had not thought over, and
                     almost dreamed over, at one time or other, to make up his mind what he had
                     better, do—what business he had better follow.</p>
                  <p>The farm, which had been left by his father, who died when Benjamin was only
                     three years of age, produced an income sufficiently large to support the heirs
                     in a plain way of living. This, though convenient in some respects, may have
                     been in other respects, a misfortune. For, before he had acquired experience in
                     any particular branch of business, so as to excel in it, as he evidently had
                     the natural abilities to do, he felt that he could <emph>afford</emph> to
                     change to something else, which he fancied he would like to try. What he was
                     losing in this way, he did not realize till gradually the time and best
                     opportunity for learning some profession, or acquiring a practical knowledge of
                     the details of some business, had passed away.</p>
                  <p>If Ben Bailey had been a little more pinched for means, so that he could not
                     have <emph>afforded</emph> to make so many beginnings, but had felt compelled
                     to drive through in some one direction, or, if in his earlier youth his friends
                     had been thoughtful enough to have urged him to make choice of something which
                     he felt was best adapted to his capacities, and he had given that his steady
                     attention, his natural abilities might have placed him in a position where, at
                     a later period, the secret work of unprincipled enemies could not have been
                     successful in deceiving the parents of Laura Sommers.</p>
                  <p>When Benjamin was sixteen years old he left the district school of his
                     neighborhood and went to the village academy two terms, where he was awarded at
                     the close<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6367-00000022"/> of the last term, the
                     highest prize in his classes for proficiency in mathematics and
                     composition.</p>
                  <p>For several years afterwards he divided his time between various mechanical
                     employments and farming, occupying most of his evenings, however, in his
                     library. When he worked at any mechanical art he seemed to do so more to
                     practice skill in handiwork, as did Louis XIV. at the smith's forge, or to
                     acquire knowledge as did Peter the Great at ship-building, than with a purpose
                     to follow any trade as a business. Even the old laboratory, once used by
                     Benjamin's father, had been of late the scene of some queer chemical
                     experiments; one of which was noticed in our first chapter, and several of
                     which, I have no doubt, would have been interesting even to the wise professor
                     of Fallington Academy.</p>
                  <p>In the winter season, at Bailey's Corners, as well as in the village of
                     Fallington, lyceums had been sustained for years back, and at both of which
                     places Benjamin was at one time acknowledged to be the most pleasing and
                     accomplished speaker.</p>
                  <p>In this way time and Benjamin went on till the fall of 1863, or just after his
                     short love experience with Miss Laura Sommers. Feeling at this time keenly the
                     unpleasant termination of his correspondence with Miss Sommers, he determined
                     upon a course which he hoped would give himself a more positive influence in
                     the community. He must be better known in society, so that slander would not so
                     easily injure him. He thought he had been active, public spirited, and liberal;
                     and so he had been. But he began to see that he needed influential friends to
                     favor him. What new course could he take to gain these?</p>
                  <p>At last he thought that the secret had come to him. He must seek every
                     opportunity, politically and otherwise, to favor persons of influence who could
                     and would do <emph>him</emph> favors in return. He could suggest their names
                     for nominations to places of profit or power. In this and other ways he thought
                     that he might gain a position which would aid him to obtain a successful
                     hearing from Laura's father. Indeed, what do <emph>not</emph> lovers think
                     of?</p>
                  <p>Impelled by a sense of justice, Benjamin Bailey had believed in anti-slavery
                     principles ever since he had first been told the meaning of the word
                        <emph>slave!</emph> And when the war to perpetuate slavery was begun by the
                     slaveholders in 1861, he was the first in the town of Fallington who offered to
                     enlist as a soldier; and had he been accepted by the examining surgeon, he
                     would probably never have been in the secret service on the Niagara
                     frontier.</p>
                  <p>When, therefore, President Lincoln made the call for three hundred thousand
                     more volunteers, in October, 1863, war meetings were held all over the Northern
                     States to encourage enlistments; some of these meetings were held at Bailey's
                     Corners, and there Benjamin Bailey, the rejected volunteer, made the first
                     speech, which brought him into political notice.</p>
                  <p>Before the fall elections were over, Ben Bailey had become a favorite political
                     speaker at Bailey's Corners, and by invitation had spoken at several meetings
                     of his party elsewhere in his county, where he always modestly claimed<pb
                        n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6367-00000023"/> to speak only as a farmer. His success
                     began to turn the notice of the villagers, socially as well as politically, in
                     his favor. Mr. Benjamin Bailey and his sister Matilda began to be invited into
                     village society. And occasionally some far-seeing, prominent politicians of
                     Ben's politics, ventured to be so democratic as to invite Ben's brother, and
                     even his mother, nervous as she was, to "come and spend an evening with
                     them."</p>
                  <p>But until within the last year the country Baileys, though members of one of
                     the largest churches in the village of Fallington, had never received an
                     invitation to any of the evening parties, or even to visit among the "leading
                     families" of the village.</p>
                  <p>Jared Bailey—or Judge Bailey, as he had been called for a number of years—was
                     supposed to be an uncle of Benjamin Bailey—or rather a half-brother of
                     Benjamin's father. It was said, and I have never learned the contrary, that the
                     title, "Judge," came to Jared Bailey through the persistence of a wag, who, in
                     derision of Mr. Bailey's private character, frequently called him
                        "<emph>Judge</emph>" for mock dignity, instead of "Jed," a nick-name for
                     Jared. For many years Jared Bailey had resided in the village of Fallington. He
                     was wealthy, and he wielded considerable influence over a certain class of
                     politicians, whose smaller influence he was able to buy up at a cheap rate. His
                     family had styled Benjamin their "odd country cousin," and had slighted him and
                     his sister Matilda, as persons too plain to be invited into their society. And
                     yet, this same Matilda was the best scholar of the village academy. Then, too,
                     of course it would not be consistent to invite Matilda and not Benjamin; and as
                     for the older brother, "Why! he had married a woman who," they said, "would be
                     sure to mortify the whole family by wearing something ridiculous, that had been
                     out of fashion three months!"</p>
                  <p>In short, widow Bailey's family, though highly respected for their integrity
                     and intelligence, had been so treated by Judge Bailey and his family, or at
                     times so significantly let alone, that the other wealthy portion of the
                     villagers did as the village Baileys did—treated them at church, or at any
                     place of accidental or perhaps unavoidable meeting, with outward, Christian
                     civility; but to notice them on grand occasions, or as if a meeting were
                     sought, or to invite them where equality might be inferred—why, that was
                     another matter! a duty among many Christian relatives not expected to be
                     performed.</p>
                  <p>But Mr. Benjamin Bailey becomes a politician among farmers, has a political
                     influence, makes political speeches in favor of this candidate and against that
                     one! This has given Ben Bailey influence—this has introduced Ben Bailey and the
                     rest of the country Baileys into a brotherly fellowship, even among the
                     aristocratic members of <emph>their own church,</emph> as well as other
                     villagers of Fallington.</p>
                  <p>It is true the villagers still notice Ben Bailey's oddity; but, apparently
                     unmindful of any change in their programme, they unite in flattering opinions
                        <emph>now,</emph> of his "originality of thought!"</p>
                  <p>The village cousins, and the old Judge in particular, see their mistake, but
                     fear it is too late to be corrected. He wonders now why he did not advise his
                     family to<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6367-00000024"/> speak well, and not ill, of
                     their country cousins. He considers, now how little their friendship would have
                     cost! "And who knows but Benjamin may rise to influence in spite of us? Their
                     friendship would not have harmed us," ponders the Judge, as a few things in his
                     secret history come back to his memory, and he fears that sometime he may have
                     friends too few or enemies one too many!</p>

                  <head type="sub">Deacon Sommers of Niagara—Too slight an acquaintance with Jared
                     Bailey—How Benjamin and the Deacon's Daughter became Lovers.</head>
                  <p>WILLIAM SOMMERS, or Deacon Sommers, as he was generally called in the town of
                     Niagara, was one of the wealthiest men on the frontier; a plain, good, kind,
                     hearted man; and, without making half the usual allowances for human frailties,
                     we may say he was in a fair sense of the term, a Christian. He undoubtedly had
                     errors of the head, but his heart was generally right. He was a man of positive
                     character. There was very little of the half-way or undecided in his faith or
                     in his practice. He loved right so well that he hated even the appearance of
                     wrong. He loved justice and freedom so much that he had a pious abhorrence of
                     slavery or oppression in any form. And yet he loved his country so well that,
                     like the noble Lincoln, he would have saved it with all her faults, rather than
                     risk her ruin in attempting to abolish her greatest evil. But when it was known
                     that the evil itself, unless abolished, would ruin the country by the terrible
                     war, Deacon Sommers was ready to sacrifice all in efforts to maintain the
                     Republic, and was almost glad of the terrible opportunity to strike down a
                     national crime which he had always hated.</p>
                  <p>Deacon Sommers, therefore, was a politician, but he<pb n="48-49"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000025"/> was a politician whose present policy was
                     consistent with, great moral principles which he had always advocated. Add to
                     this, his wealth placed him above that temptation which comes sometimes
                     successfully to others; for no corrupt politician was emboldened to approach
                     him with bribery for any <emph>need he had of money!</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>At times politics reached so high a standard in his election district that
                     Deacon Sommers, in spite of enemies envious of his good fortune, was chosen a
                     delegate to conventions for nominating important officers. At some of these
                     conventions he had met with Judge Bailey, so that a sort of acquaintance had
                     been kept up ever since his removal to Fallington from Niagara, many years
                     before. For Mr. Bailey had once lived a short time within a few miles of Deacon
                     Sommers, and both had belonged to the same church. During their summer visits
                     to Niagara, Judge Bailey and his wife had made calls upon Deacon Sommers and
                     his family; and hence the latter thought they were acquainted with the
                     former—that is, with their outward character—but there was a private character
                     known to a few, of which Deacon Sommers and his family knew nothing.</p>
                  <p>Laura Sommers was the only daughter of Mr. and Mrs. William Sommers. At the
                     time she wrote the letter breaking off her correspondence with Benjamin Bailey,
                     she was in her nineteenth year.</p>
                  <p>It seems that in the early part of May, 1863, which, it will be remembered from
                     the date, was one year prior to young Bailey's appointment to go to Niagara—it
                     had been arranged for Laura and her mother to make a visit to some of their
                     acquaintances in Fallington; and Deacon Sommers insisted that they should,
                     while there, make Judge Bailey's family a visit also.</p>
                  <p>Whether Deacon Sommers, like many other fathers having marriageable daughters,
                     was thinking it good policy for his daughter to make the acquaintance of
                     wealthy families, and whether it occurred to him that possibly Judge Bailey's
                     son David might be a suitable young man to reciprocate such acquaintance, I am
                     not able positively to say; but I can say most positively, that Deacon Sommers
                     should have known more of David Bailey before taking any special pains to favor
                     a matter of such moment.</p>
                  <p>Of their visit in Fallington, and how it happened that Benjamin Bailey, of
                     Bailey's Corners, and Laura Sommers became acquainted, and how they at first
                     were mutually interested in each other, and why it was that Laura's mother was
                     also pleased with Benjamin, and why she returned home to Niagara Falls, leaving
                     Laura to make a longer visit, were circumstances which, though very interesting
                     at the time to the parties themselves, were matters which most of my readers no
                     doubt can imagine more vividly than I can picture, on account of little
                     personal experiences of their own!</p>
                  <p>I will, however, say that the primary cause of it all seemed to be as in "oft
                     repeated tales"—"love at first sight!" And then, was it not perfectly natural
                     that the mother should be pleased that somebody loved her daughter?</p>
                  <p>As a further apology, however, for Benjamin Bailey's<pb n="50-51"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000026"/> very human weakness of "falling in love at first
                     sight," we might say that there was nobody but what said (if they said anything
                     about it) that Laura Sommers was a beautiful girl; and that her face bore an
                     intelligent and amiable expression; while there were those besides young Bailey
                     who thought her charming and lovely. She was cheerful and lively, without
                     appearing rude; modest, but not bashful; frank and plain spoken, and yet
                     careful not to wound the feelings of others. But as to her disposition or
                     temper under great provocation, and whether she may not have sometimes
                     exhibited human failings—we dare not say that in all this she was perfection.
                     She seemed, however, to secure the good will of all who knew her. Her manner
                     and conversation were easy and entertaining, never haughty or affected. Her
                     stature was a little above the average height, and her form perfect. Her
                        <emph>own</emph> dark brown hair hung in natural ringlets to her shoulders,
                     leaving her intelligently formed head free from artificial disfigurement; while
                     her animated thoughts gave expression to her deep blue eyes, and furnished a
                     natural rose tint to the whiteness of her complexion.</p>
                  <p>It was at church, the next Sabbath after Laura Sommers' arrival in Fallington,
                     that Benjamin Bailey first saw her. Twice on that Sabbath day their eyes
                     met—probably a mere chance occurrence, and no doubt each regarded it as such,
                     or at least, like two well-bred strangers, they had the manners to make it
                        <emph>appear</emph> so; though I should not like to say positively that it
                     was as accidental as it appeared to be! for the next Sabbath a like occurrence,
                     took place. And then, too. a letter which he wrote to Miss Laura Sommers, just
                     after he had seen her one day in Mr. Baldwin's store, was dated within less
                     than two weeks of the first Sabbath referred to. In the letter he expressed a
                     desire to make her acquaintance, and asked the pleasure of an interview with
                     her at the house of her friend, Mrs. Cummings, where she and her mother were
                     then visiting.</p>
                  <p>The interview was granted, the reply being made in a very neat and proper
                     letter. Benjamin called upon Laura, introduced himself, Mrs. Sommers was
                     present, the visit closed, and the mother and daughter were favorably impressed
                     with Mr. Benjamin Bailey. Other visits were made, and before two months
                     Benjamin and Laura were lovers, betrothed on conditions that her father would
                     give his approval.</p>
                  <p>And was it anything so very strange that he loved her? I think not!</p>
                  <p>But how I shall apologize for Laura Sommers taking such a liking, as she did
                     from the very first, to Benjamin Bailey, is not an easy task to do; for it has
                     always been a wonder to me how such pretty, little, sensitive creatures as the
                     ladies all are, could ever really love anything so ridiculous as a great stout
                     man, with such awkward, large hands and feet, and such a coarse, harsh voice
                     that always sounds like grumbling, and never as if he had any feelings that
                     could make him cry or scream! No, I never could understand it; and even my own
                     little wife's explanation doesn't seem reasonable about it! Only think of it!
                     Ladies, what taste! What inconsistency for you to put tender, lace covered arms
                     on a plain, heavy, everyday<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6367-00000027"/> day coat
                     sleeve—and perhaps around <emph>his</emph> neck; and your tender faces against
                     great, huge whiskers, or rough, stubbed beard!</p>
                  <p>All I can possibly say in explanation is that it must be because God, in his
                     good providence, has so ordered it for the good of <emph>man</emph> kind. Then
                     as to Benjamin Bailey, he was not a great, huge fellow, and he was a man of as
                     fine feelings and good sense as I ever became acquainted with on the frontier
                     or elsewhere.</p>
                  <p>Was it strange, then, after all, that Laura Sommers should be interested in
                     being loved till she loved Benjamin in return? Perhaps not.</p>

                  <p>SHAKESPEARE, no doubt, intended when he wrote the above line, to make it
                     express a general truth. If Mr. Shakespeare was correct in this, a large number
                     of mankind, since Adam and Eve had their first falling out, have had their
                     little difficulties, as well as Benjamin Bailey, when "the course of love did
                     not run smooth."</p>
                  <p>The correspondence between Benjamin Bailey and Miss Sommers had begun, no
                     doubt, upon too short an acquaintance. However worthy they were, their good
                     opinion of each other was liable to be changed by unjust remarks from envious
                     persons. Had it been young Bailey's good fortune to have seen some way of
                     making his character and circumstances known to Mr. Sommers—and
                        <emph>certainly</emph> known—before any person with sinister motives could
                     have discovered any object to cut off his communications with the Sommers
                     family, the shortness of the acquaintance would have been less dangerous to his
                     success, and perhaps to the happiness of both. But the beginning of a first
                     courtship, like all other first beginnings, is of course without the advantage
                     of previous experience! and to<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6367-00000028"/> make
                     the matter still worse, it is said that "love is blind!"</p>
                  <p>When Judge Bailey knew that his country nephew was paying some attentions to
                     Miss Sommers, he set his wits to work. He had more than one wicked reason for
                     doing so! He had thought that his own son might possibly succeed in winning the
                     affections of Miss Sommers, whose father he knew was wealthy. David Bailey had
                     already been told that he must not marry the daughter of widow Smith. But there
                     was another reason why Judge Bailey did not wish to have Benjamin Bailey become
                     too intimate with people in the town of Niagara—a reason which he has not
                     explained to his son David. No; and he never will. There was an old crime which
                     lay at the foundation of Judge Jared Bailey's property. That crime was known to
                     two or three living witnesses residing in the vicinity of Niagara Falls. John
                     Vroman was a bribed witness of the crime; Jerusha, his daughter, an artful,
                     beautiful and ungovernable maiden, had discovered traces of the crime, but,
                     under promises of gain, and by kind attention from Judge Bailey and his wife,
                     Jerusha had consented to conceal what she knew. And to make the matter still
                     more secure, Judge Bailey had won her affections by offering her a home in his
                     family, which she had accepted, and where at last she became equally interested
                     in concealing wrong.</p>
                  <p>The old crime related to property of which Benjamin Bailey was one of the
                     rightful heirs. The crime had taken place in Jared Bailey's younger days, but
                     it had been done in the town of Niagara, and, in his guilty fears, he preferred
                     that Benjamin should not go there!</p>
                  <p>Thus influenced, Judge Bailey planned a wicked and cruel slander against
                     Benjamin, which he cautiously wrote to Deacon Sommers, and which Mrs. Bailey,
                     urged by her husband and by Jerusha, endorsed by writing another letter to Mrs.
                     Sommers. Poor woman, no matter what Jared Bailey had done, Mrs. Bailey, loved
                     him. She feared he was in danger, and she almost loved Jerusha for advising
                     wrong upon wrong to save him.</p>
                  <p>The plan succeeded in causing Miss Sommers, through the commands of her father,
                     to write the unhappy letter referred to.</p>
                  <p>Judge Bailey regretted, however, that his plan had also caused Laura's
                     immediate departure home to Niagara.</p>
                  <p>When Benjamin received the letter he was nearly bewildered by its mysterious
                     contents. But he did not rest without attempting to find out the source of this
                     trouble. The same day, after receiving the letter, he called at Judge Bailey's
                     to see Laura Sommers, and was told by Mrs. Judge Bailey that Miss Sommers was
                     not in. He was too disheartened and disappointed to trust himself to ask any
                     further questions concerning her, and he turned away, wondering what course he
                     had better take.</p>
                  <p>When he reached home he went immediately to his library, and read the letter
                     over and over again. Finally he wrote a short note, simply asking Laura Sommers
                     if he might have the privilege to see her, and offering, so soon as he could
                     find out what dishonorable thing had been told against him, to satisfy her and
                     her friends of<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6367-00000029"/> his innocence. He went
                     back to Fallington the same afternoon, and put the letter in the
                     post-office.</p>
                  <p>Toward evening of the next day he went again to the post-office, but found no
                     letter there from Laura Sommers. He went again the second day—no letter; the
                     third day, and the same unfavorable result. He then went to the residence of
                     Judge Bailey, where he knew Laura had been visiting a week or more, and had
                     intended to stay a week or two longer.</p>
                  <p>At Judge Bailey's he saw no one but the servant girl and his aunt Ellen. The
                     latter informed him that Miss Sommers had that day started on her return home
                     to Niagara Falls.</p>
                  <p>"May I inquire," said Benjamin, "if you know whether she went to the
                     post-office to-day or yesterday, to get any letters that may have been there
                     for her?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes; she went to the post-office just before starting for home," replied Mrs.
                     Judge Bailey.</p>
                  <p>"Did she go herself?" inquired Benjamin, a little disconcerted.</p>
                  <p>"Of course she went <emph>herself,</emph> if she went at all; and I believe she
                     got a letter, though I do not know who it was from; perhaps it was from you,
                     Benjamin?"</p>
                  <p>Benjamin was now still more embarrassed; he had made the inquiry without
                     forethought, and instantly regretted that he had done so. He knew too little of
                     his aunt Ellen to know whether she was disposed to injure him by words, or
                     simply to let him alone with an aristocratic neglect. He feared, however, he
                     had trusted an inquiry to one who might color it up as an impertinent question.
                     True, he was in a confused and anxious state of mind, but sometimes one's best
                     friends refuse to be satisfied with such an apology.</p>
                  <p>After a moment's hesitation he replied, evasively, that he hoped he had not
                     conveyed an impression that Miss Sommers was expecting letters from him; and,
                     said he, "I will say, to do justice to Miss Sommers, I presume she does not—or
                     rather would not, desire to receive letters from me; hence, will you be kind
                     enough not to construe my inquiry in such a direction?"</p>
                  <p>After waiting a few weeks, and getting no clue to the slander, nor any further
                     information from Laura Sommers, he wrote to her father as follows:</p>

                                 short, to avoid associating the names of innocent parties with
                                 unpleasant gossip. You will, therefore, let the matter drop where
                                 it is; and especially not seek to continue an acquaintance with my
                                 daughter. I understand that my daughter has already written to you
                                 that under the circumstances, all correspondence had better
                                 cease.</p>

                  <p>By this letter Benjamin Bailey saw that his slanderers had been so expert that
                     it was most likely they were old hands in their game of meanness.</p>
                  <p>Although he could suspect no one but Jared Bailey's family of being the source
                     of the slanderous talk to injure him with the Sommers family, yet he knew no
                     reason why the village Baileys could have any motive that could induce any of
                     them to invent falsehoods to injure him. He knew that David had for a long time
                     back, been paying attentions to the daughter of a poor widow in the village,
                     and he supposed therefore that there could be no motive of rivalry. Neither had
                     Laura Sommers or her father any reason yet to suspect any such motive. No, the
                     plan was a shrewd one; David was to show no such intention till two things were
                     accomplished; first, his country cousin, as an obstacle, was to be removed;
                     then he must get rid of the widow's daughter gradually, or in some way, so the
                     matter should make him as little trouble as possible, and not turn publicly to
                     his discredit. This was a matter for David to bring about, but the other
                     obstacle was what Judge Bailey himself had undertaken to remove.</p>
                  <p>David had at first loved the widow's daughter as much as a selfish,
                     unprincipled libertine could be expected to love any beautiful and virtuous,
                     high-minded and accomplished young lady. It was owing to the strict propriety,
                     however, of her own deportment that the widow's daughter in their courtship had
                     even partly changed David Bailey's sensual, sordid, selfish love toward an
                     honorable love, based on respect, esteem, friendship, sympathy and<pb n="60-61"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000031"/> honorable intention. The widow's daughter knew
                     nothing of David Bailey's private character. Whatever had been said truthfully
                     against Judge Bailey or his son, there had been just enough interested in the
                     Judge's family to deny the truth of it; and even to retaliate by falsehood for
                     its having been spoken!</p>
                  <p>Investigation into some late matters against Judge Bailey had been threatened,
                     but was dropped from the delicacy of witnesses, from intimidation, and from his
                     private settlements, or bribery!.</p>
                  <p>When Judge Bailey first suggested to his son that after two or three months he
                     had better pay no more attention to the widow's daughter, neither the son nor
                     his father for one moment considered the feelings of the young lady. The Judge
                     summed up the case; the son thought he could agree to it. The conclusion was,
                     that the widow's daughter was poor, and that Miss Sommers was rich! To the
                     widow's daughter this heartless conversation and conclusion was no doubt, to be
                     to her, a blessing in disguise.</p>
                  <p>It was for want of knowing a motive for Judge Bailey's family to interfere,
                     that Benjamin Bailey did not form a more positive opinion as to whence came the
                     slander against him. It was not because he had too good an opinion of Jared
                     Bailey to suspect him; for, besides many things which passed as mere rumor
                     against him, there were some late matters whispered of among the relatives, not
                     known to the public; and Benjamin knew more of some of these than the Judge was
                     aware of. It was Benjamin's private opinion that the old Judge would stoop to
                     almost any wickedness which he could conceal.</p>
                  <p>As Benjamin read and re-read Mr. Sommers' letter, the thought would come to him
                     that the originator of the slander might be Jared Bailey; but if it were so,
                     how could he convince Mr. Sommers against his assertions, without first showing
                     that he was an unprincipled man, and prompted by selfish motives? And how could
                     he do this while he was refused even a hearing? It was a delicate matter, too,
                     for Mr. Sommers' family as well as for himself.</p>
                  <p>And then Benjamin called to mind several disreputable things, positively known,
                     against Judge Bailey's character, which, for the sake of the family name, the
                     relatives had concealed among themselves.</p>
                  <p>There was a <emph>belief,</emph> too, among some of the relatives, that Judge
                     Bailey, many years before this, had obtained fraudulently the signature of his
                     father to a will just before his father's death, and by fraud or bribery had
                     also obtained the signatures of the subscribing witnesses to the will.</p>
                  <p>The circumstances which led to the suspicion that Jared Bailey had, somehow,
                     obtained more than his rightful share from Benjamin's grandfather, Mortimer
                     Bailey, were as follows: his last will and testament gave property to the
                     amount of seventy-five thousand dollars to Jared Bailey, and only about twenty
                     thousand dollars worth of land, near Fallington, to John, Benjamin and Matilda
                     Bailey, heirs of Dr. Luke Bailey, deceased.</p>
                  <p>Mortimer Bailey, at the time this will was made, was on a visit to Jared
                     Bailey's, where, by an accident, he met with injuries which, though not at
                     first thought<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6367-00000032"/> serious, did at the end
                     of three weeks prove fatal. After his death a will was produced, making the
                     above unequal division of property. The will was dated two weeks after the
                     injuries had been received. The friends of Mrs. Dr. Luke Bailey's family
                     inquired into the matter, but found that the signatures of Mortimer Bailey, and
                     the witnesses John Vroman, James Figsley and Adeline Wilderman, were genuine.
                     And Mrs. Jared Bailey, with great seriousness, and having the reputation of a
                     pious woman, declared that she was present and heard the testator express his
                     wishes and dictate the writing of the will, and saw him read and sign it. The
                     doctor who attended him, affirmed that he was in his right mind up to the day
                     and hour of his death. A circumstance, however, took place afterwards, which
                     created a suspicion that a fraud had been committed; but the legal evidence was
                     wanting! or rather it was not to be obtained at the time it was wanted or
                     sought for!</p>
                  <p>An innocent girl, by name of Eleanor Grace, was living in the family of Jared
                     Bailey at the time the will was made. She, not long afterward, stated some
                     facts in answer to inquiries, which created suspicion and contradicted
                     important declarations that had been made by Mr. and Mrs. Jared Bailey, who had
                     become frightened, and, in order to throw discredit upon Eleanor's statements,
                     had represented her to be a girl of so bad a character, that they had been
                     compelled to refuse her a home with them any longer than till she could find
                     some other place to live. For reasons that could only be surmised, the
                     witnesses to the will, and parties interested in it, sided with Jared Bailey's
                     family against Eleanor's character, till some of Eleanor's friends for whom she
                     most cared, including a young man to whom she was expecting soon to be married,
                     could not doubt so many witness, and turned against her also—without
                     considering that they were, perhaps, all interested in securing a portion of
                     the property. Heart-broken and desperate for the injustice done her, she was
                     too impulsive to wait for time to defend her, and she suddenly disappeared—no
                     one knowing whither she went.</p>
                  <p>A brief letter sent to Benjamin's mother, from Eleanor, read as follows:</p>
                  <q>
                     <floatingText>
                        <body>
                           <div type="letter">
                              <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Dear Mrs. Bailey—I saw and heard enough to know
                                 there was another will. I heard the sick man read it; it divided
                                 the property equally, giving no more to Jared Bailey than to you
                                 and each of your children. The next day after that will was made
                                 and signed, they pretended there was a mistake and they would write
                                 it over. They then let the old man read a copy which was written as
                                 he wanted it should be, and while he was raising up to prepare to
                                 write his name they exchanged for a different will than what he had
                                 read. This I saw with my own eyes as the door stood ajar! Mrs.
                                 Bailey was in the room and aided the deception. Adeline knows the
                                 truth, but is afraid to tell it.</p>
                              <p>"But my evidence could do you no good, for they would swear me into
                                 prison for telling the truth. They have robbed me of all that was
                                 dear on earth to me, and<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6367-00000033"/>
                                 now—but no matter. Vindication and vengeance will yet be mine.</p>

                  <p>And the letter <emph>was true,</emph> but it took twenty years for time to
                     develope the evidence; but when it did so, it brought to light the
                     accumulations of other wrongs.</p>
                  <p>At the time her letter was written, however, the statements of Eleanor Grace
                     were thrown into discredit; and when at last she did not appear, John Vroman
                     started a report that Eleanor had been seen in a dance house in New York city,
                     in a pitiful state of intoxication. <emph>Under the circumstances,</emph> it
                     was for Mrs. Jared Bailey's <emph>interest,</emph> to believe the story; and so
                     she reported, as she touched with feigned regret the corner of her handkerchief
                     to her eyes, that she supposed the story was true!</p>
                  <p>Nearly twenty years was now passed, and nothing more had been heard of Eleanor
                     Grace, and no further light about the will; so that at this time Benjamin
                     detests Jared Bailey less for any suspicions about the will, than for the mean,
                     heartless and relentless falsehoods he was known by a few of the relatives to
                     have reported, to screen himself from blame, by attempting to misrepresent
                     certain respectable females, who had exposed his peculiar style of abuse, and
                     sometimes his criminal assaults upon them. Benjamin himself had a partial
                     knowledge of one instance, which happened an evening a few weeks before Laura
                     Sommers came to Fallington. The circumstance confirmed him in the opinion, that
                     the aristocratic old man was a criminal at heart. He did not, however, deem it
                     best to report the matter, since it would be embarrassing to innocent parties,
                     and truth might have to battle with so many falsehoods that the
                        <emph>innocent</emph> would be injured!</p>
                  <p>What he knew of the affair was this:</p>
                  <p>Benjamin had been requested by Mr. Baldwin, on the evening referred to, to
                     leave a letter at Judge Bailey's, as he passed that way.</p>
                  <p>"A fine residence this," thought Benjamin, as he opened Judge Bailey's front
                     gate, and walked toward his house, through an alley bordered with box wood;
                     "and it hardly seems possible that it covers so much sin as some of the family
                     relatives hint of among ourselves! 'Charity hideth a multitude of wickedness!'
                     as black Jim quotes it," said Benjamin to himself, "but riches and hypocrisy,"
                     added Benjamin, "a great deal more!"</p>
                  <p>When about to ring the door bell, he was startled by a sudden jam against the
                     door from the inside, as if a person had run or been pushed against it, which
                     of course led Benjamin to pause a moment before ringing an interruption to the
                     inmates of the residence of the dignified Judge Bailey.</p>
                  <p>The disturbance was repeated, during which time our accidental listener
                     overheard a female voice saying, "You old hypocrite! if your wife would slander
                     me to screen you, I shall expose you just the same, as a heartless wretch! or,
                     if you like it any better, I will give you till to-morrow noon to settle this
                     matter. This is your last insult! you old brute!"</p>
                  <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6367-00000034"/>
                  <p>"For heaven's sake, stop your noise and I'll settle it," said a voice which
                     Benjamin was certain he recognized as that of the old Judge! though the voice
                     was in a subdued tone.</p>
                  <p>As soon as this mysterious little quarrel had seemed to cease, Benjamin rang
                     the door bell; but no one came to the door till he was obliged to ring a second
                     time. Then old Bailey himself came to the door, and received the letter as if
                     nothing had happened; except that Benjamin thought the old man's attempt to
                     smile looked as if it was composed of equal parts of hypocrisy, depravity,
                     selfishness and confusion.</p>
                  <p>As Benjamin put away the letter from Mr. Sommers in his secretary, and thought
                     of the circumstance just related, he said to himself, "As I live, if I had much
                     grounds to suppose that he is the one who has separated Laura Sommers from me,
                     by some wicked plan, I would have that front-door mystery investigated! I would
                     find out what female voice that was, and how crime can be settled! It was
                     undoubtedly an assault with criminal intent."</p>
                  <p>Then he reflected, that, in case of his exposing the Judge, it would be no
                     credit to himself to have it said that Judge Bailey was any
                        <emph>relation</emph> of his; "and yet," thought Ben, by way of apology,
                     "everybody is related to <emph>somebody</emph> whose organism has been unduly
                     affected by the law of total depravity.</p>
                  <p>But, finally, Benjamin concluded that he must drop the slander matter; at least
                     so far as to wait further developments.</p>
                  <p>Up to the time when Benjamin Bailey received the appointment to go to Niagara,
                     which was, as we have before intimated, about one year after the occurrences
                     above related nothing took place to give Benjamin any light on the subject of
                     the slander. Though he sometimes consoled himself with the old adage, that
                     "Truth and right will prevail," or that "It is a long road that has no
                     turn."</p>
                  <p>And it is, indeed true, that the guilty have as much reason to fear as the
                     innocent have to hope. For they who follow a course of deception and depravity,
                     or do any acts disregardful of the rights and feelings of others, O, do they
                     not find at last, that events connect themselves together on the map of time,
                     so that they trace each other out!</p>

                  <head type="sub">A peep into a Private Political Caucus—A Humiliating
                     Necessity—The Little Lawyer's Startling Proposition.</head>
                  <p>JUDGE BAILEY was a shrewd politician, and had managed to keep in office, first
                     in one party and then in the other, for a number of years; and, since his son
                     David's last failure in the dry goods business, he had been talking with some
                     of his confidential, political friends on the prospect of securing an
                     appointment for his son, to some good government office. These friends had all
                     promised to do what they could. This meant much, or little. With some it meant
                     all they could do "consistently;" with others, all they could do "under
                     existing circumstances;" with some it simply meant that what they could do was
                     nothing; for the delicate reason that they had more particular friends whom it
                     was more to their own interest to prefer; besides, there were many others whose
                     friendship they would be glad to purchase by the same favor; or, perhaps
                     because they had alike promised their influence to a dozen others for the same
                     place; or, perhaps it meant they could do nothing, simply because—as they
                     secretly knew—they had no influence in the direction they were giving
                     encouragement!</p>
                  <p>There are, however, some men in politics as in other matters, who can be relied
                     on. Judge Bailey understood all this. He understood, too, the influences which
                     would be most effectual in making his professed friends serve him, whether they
                     were real friends or not. So long as he could make them believe that it was to
                     their <emph>interest</emph> to serve him, so long he told himself they would
                     serve him. He understood all the shades of political promises, and had made
                     them; promises with mental reservations; promises with various conditions; and
                     no doubt many for various "considerations." Some of these promises Mr. Jared
                     Bailey intended to keep faithfully. When he thought it was for his interest to
                     remember a political "understanding" he never forgot how it was understood.
                     When he did not accomplish for others, all that political advantage which he
                     had led them to expect, he either made ingenious explanations, or declared that
                     he had found it, at that juncture of affairs, impossible. Then he made new
                     promises.</p>
                  <p>The day before the scenes at widow Bailey's—the notable explosion and the
                     telegraphic announcement of Benjamin's appointment—some of Judge Bailey's
                     friends and political subalterns, whom he could rely on, were invited to a
                     consultation at his office, where it was talked over who would be good men for
                     such and such offices. Some who were not present were talked over at first; but
                     finally they took up each other's "claims" on the "party," and the result of
                     their little private caucus showed that under the head of "claims," and
                     "availability," and the self-sacrificing spirit which each and all had shown in
                     attending war-meetings, and in urging men to enlist in the<pb n="70-71"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000036"/> army, each one there present at Judge Bailey's
                     caucus, was marked down on the political slate, for nomination or appointment,
                     and chances were canvassed for three or four years ahead.</p>
                  <p>"There are," said Judge Bailey, "certain persons who have influence in every
                     neighborhood, and, as a matter of policy essential to success, we must secure
                     their friendship; but if we find that we cannot control their influence—if they
                     are too selfish, and try to gobble up offices that naturally belong to some of
                     us, why, then, we must <emph>put them down,</emph> and put forward some others
                     in their places whom we <emph>can</emph> control! And right here," added the
                     Judge, "while I think of it, we must all be sure to advise our friends in each
                     election district of the county, to get their friends to be seen at every
                     caucus and preliminary meeting; for, don't you see," said the Judge, with a
                     significant smile and a cunning sparkle in his small red eyes, "there is where
                     the ball is started—where the twig is bent, and where the secret lies—where
                     they make the delegates that set up either our friends or our enemies!"</p>
                  <p>Finally, Judge Bailey got things ready where he could modestly say, that seeing
                     they were all together he wished they would get up a letter and all sign it, so
                     that his friend, Mr. Lyman Baldwin, who was now in Washington, could see (said
                     Judge Bailey, watching closely the effect of his artful words) that "we are all
                     acting together as his friends, and that we can support him in recommending
                     David to the appointment as custom-house detective on the Niagara frontier. Mr.
                     Baldwin," he continued, "is the special agent, you know, and there is a
                     vacancy, so that he can make one selection to fill an office there. He wants
                     David to have the appointment, but if the pressure of influence is too strongly
                     in favor of some other candidate, on account of our <emph>neglecting</emph> the
                     matter, of course he would have to go for whoever that other candidate might
                     be."</p>
                  <p>Of course Judge Bailey don't want these friends of his to suspect that David
                     can fail of getting the appointment by any lack of <emph>his influence;</emph>
                     for their <emph>belief</emph> in his influence is his power over them!</p>
                  <p>"Let me make a suggestion here," said one of the shrewdest of the number
                     present. "You know, Judge, that Lyman Baldwin is under great obligation to some
                     others besides our friends. Now, there is Ben Bailey, I've been told this very
                     day has more influence with Baldwin's friends than any other man among all the
                     farmers in the country, and if you could get his name to our paper it would
                     show that we have the farming community represented with us, which none of our
                     names you know will show."</p>
                  <p>"Well, that is so, Judge," said another, "and of course you being a relative
                     can easily get his name.</p>
                  <p>"There worst of it is," said the Judge, after a moment's hesitation, "our
                     families have never been intimate enough."</p>
                  <p>"No," said David, "I don't suppose we could ask or expect Ben to favor me in
                     such a way as this, and I don't think father and I need his help."</p>
                  <p>"I think we can find some better man to represent that class," said the
                     Judge.</p>
                  <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6367-00000037"/>
                  <p>"Get <emph>him,</emph> though, if you can," said the man who had made the
                     suggestion.</p>
                  <p>David Bailey's letter of recommendation was then made out, and as they walked
                     up to the table, one after another, and signed their names, the Judge said he
                     presumed that Ben Bailey would sign it, too, as he had always treated him very
                     kindly himself; at any rate he would see him the next day.</p>
                  <p>Finally, they had all signed except the village lawyer, who had not appeared
                     well satisfied with the prospects allotted to his share of the political
                     future.</p>
                  <p>"If there be nothing more to do here," said the little lawyer, with a
                     mysterious expression, "I claim the privilege to propose—"</p>
                  <p>Here the little lawyer paused and looked slowly around as if to inspect the
                     number present. The Judge was afraid something was going wrong. All turned
                     attention to the little lawyer, who, knowing the tricks of a public speaker,
                     had lengthened his pause on the word propose, just enough for their impatience
                     to intensify their curiosity to know what it was he wanted to propose, when
                     they had supposed everything agreed upon.</p>
                  <p>"To propose," repeated the little lawyer, "that as soon as we shall have
                     completed the signing of this document, we proceed <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en
                        masse</foreign> to the American Hotel or to Dutch Henry's lager beer saloon,
                     and that the Judge and David individually, and at two several times
                     successively, stand treat for all that shall be then and there present."</p>
                  <p>"Certainly, a perfect <foreign xml:lang="LAT">sine qui non!</foreign>" said
                     one.</p>
                  <p>"Bravo! bravo!" said another.</p>
                  <p>"So mote it be," acquiesced the Judge, in a merry mood.</p>
                  <p>At the same moment all the rest manifested in some way that they favored the
                     little lawyer's proposition—as exactly the thing.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, one thing more," said the little lawyer, as she stepped forward and took
                     up his pen, "the Judge is to go for me for Member of Assembly next year."</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said the Judge in his most winning way, while he took care to qualify
                     his promise, "we will all go for you just as long as there is a possible chance
                     for your nomination."</p>
                  <p>And as the little lawyer turned his eyes with an inquiring look, he thought the
                     rest of them gave a very cordial sanction to the aforesaid political promise.
                     The little lawyer signed the paper. The Judge thanked his friends. And the
                     little lawyer said: "Now which, the hotel or the saloon?"</p>
                  <p>"The nearest one first, and the other afterwards," promptly responded one whose
                     face had acquired a permanent blush.</p>
                  <p>They went accordingly.</p>

                  <head type="sub">An unusual Visit—Mysterious Matters Referred to—Most Angry
                     towards whom he has most Injured—How a bold, bad man tries to stand upon his
                     dignity.</head>
                  <p>THE next day after the private caucus held in the office of Judge Bailey, he
                     drove into the country to see his nephew. He has the paper in his pocket, which
                     was signed by his political friends, in favor of his son's appointment. Judge
                     Bailey wants Benjamin's name to that paper! We shall see if he gets it. This
                     day was full of events at the farm house—even the old anvil had to explode, as
                     you remember. And the boy, who had brought the telegram announcing Benjamin
                     Bailey's appointment to the very office the Judge is seeking for his son,—had
                     been gone from the door of the old farm house less than half an hour, when the
                     aristocratic relative rapped on the same door. Matilda proceeded to answer the
                     call; and her mother, in a suppressed tone of voice, exclaimed:</p>
                  <p>"Mercy on me! Matilda, I hope that telegraph boy is not back here again!"</p>
                  <p>Matilda met her uncle at the door, and invited him into the parlor so politely
                     and kindly, that the Judge was now willing to forget that he or his family had
                     ever wronged or proudly neglected his country relatives. And he hoped, in his
                     selfishness, that he might find Widow Bailey equally forgetful of the old
                     suspicions against him, and willing to "let by-gones be by-gones." The Judge
                     had the vanity, too, to think his call was an honor to the widow's family; for
                     he had a habit of forgetting, or seeming to forget, any mean thing he had done
                     against his poorer relatives. No matter how great that injury, any reference to
                     it, or any satisfaction demanded, he considered an insult, and thought himself
                     meanly used if not immediately forgiven, in consideration of what he intended
                     to do for them—after his death—in his will!</p>
                  <p>When Mrs. Bailey entered the parlor, and shook hands with Jared Bailey, she
                     exclaimed:</p>
                  <p>"Mercy on me! Mr. Bailey, what brought you here! Why, how is your family? Why
                     don't they never come to see us?"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Bailey was very agreeable; he had <emph>often intended</emph> to come, but
                     he did not go anywhere!</p>
                  <p>After a few moments, he inquired for Benjamin.</p>
                  <p>Benjamin was sent for—came into the parlor. The uncle and nephew met! The uncle
                     was never so cordial in his greeting; the nephew was polite, but formal. They
                     talked of the weather, and of matters of general interest. At last, the Judge
                     was glad to hear that Benjamin was quite a politician; and if he ever wanted an
                     office, he, the Judge, could help him, and should be glad to do so. "The way it
                     is with politicians," said Judge Bailey, attempting a very pleasant smile,
                     "they must help each other; and I thought, perhaps, you would like to put your
                     name down with some of the most influential ones of our party, who are friendly
                     together, and are always<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6367-00000039"/> willing to
                     help each other. It is for an office Mr. Baldwin's friends are asking for your
                     cousin David."</p>
                  <p>"Cousin David! Very doubtful compliment!" thought Benjamin; but he checked
                     himself, and asked:</p>
                  <p>"What is the office which he desires?"</p>
                  <p>"Well," said the Judge, "Mr. Baldwin is a special agent of the Treasury; and,
                     as he is a particular friend of mine, he is anxious to give David an office,
                     which will require him, I suppose, to go to the Niagara District on some
                     private matters connected with the customs department!"</p>
                  <p>Without replying to this last remark, Benjamin invited his uncle into his
                     library.</p>
                  <p>The Judge entered the library with Benjamin, and seated himself with all the
                     confidence of a bold and selfish hypocrite. He had, no doubt, long ago settled
                     into the conviction, that his wealth, his duplicity, and the standing of his
                     friends, were sufficient to conceal his meanness from very much
                        <emph>notice,</emph> even if not from belief. Though it was true a few of
                     his acts had sometimes been the gossip of his neighbors; but they had been
                     hushed up by presents to those who cared little for their truth, or smothered
                     by other influences, so that the status of the village Baileys in society
                     remained not perceptibly changed. In fact, there were many who claimed that
                     Judge Bailey and his wife were both very benevolent people—very kind, very
                     obliging. But there were a few and Benjamin among them, who knew that what
                     appeared, to be generosity was generally prompted by motives extremely
                     selfish—a sort of bribe thrown upon "society," to work up its good will; or, in
                     special cases, a bid for the attention of friends and flatterers; or a stingy
                     amount of something, as a mixture of conscience money and hush money, given for
                     wrongs they had brought upon others!</p>
                  <p>O, if Benjamin only knew positively—if he had the <emph>evidence</emph> of the
                     secret history of this man, how much it might have availed him towards making
                     Judge Bailey set him right with Deacon Sommers and his daughter! As little as
                     he does know, he has determined to seize upon this opportunity, to attempt to
                     find out the source of the slander, and have it contradicted.</p>
                  <p>The Judge, thus far, was pleased with his reception. He expressed great
                     satisfaction that his nephew had so fine a library.</p>
                  <p>"What paper do you wish me to sign?" inquired the nephew, without appearing to
                     notice the uncle's flattering remarks.</p>
                  <p>The Judge then showed him the paper.</p>
                  <p>When the nephew had looked over the petition in favor of David for the very
                     office which that moment he secretly held himself, he must have felt that the
                     position of his village uncle was slightly ridiculous! It was, indeed,
                     humiliating enough for the Judge to ask (or beg rather) a favor from his
                     country nephew, whom he had allowed his family to slight in every social way,
                     and whom he himself had only one year before most wickedly contrived to injure,
                     by falsehood to the father of Laura Sommers!</p>
                  <p>But the old man had arrived to that point of selfishness<pb n="78-79"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000040"/> ness, where conscience and honor were only
                     sensitive so far as he believed himself exposed, or likely to be so.</p>
                  <p>Had he known what Benjamin knew concerning the appointment, or even of all the
                     reasons which Benjamin had for suspicions against his connection with the
                     slander affair, the present ridiculous tableau of old Bailey in Ben's library,
                     praying for his political influence in favor of David, would never have taken
                     place. But since it did take place, Benjamin thought it a fit occasion to test
                     his suspicions, which of late had grown much stronger against his uncle. He,
                     therefore, approached matters with the artful old man carefully.</p>
                  <p>"Uncle Bailey," said Benjamin, "what reason have you to suppose the little
                     influence I may have would do you any good?"</p>
                  <p>"I have been told it would. It would certainly do no harm; and it would be a
                     commencement of reciprocating favors, and Mr. Baldwin's friends and my friends
                     will be able to help you in case you should come up for office."</p>
                  <p>"But, uncle, the names you have here will never secure that office."</p>
                  <p>"Do you know that, Benjamin?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir, I <emph>know</emph> that!"</p>
                  <p>"That may be so," replied the Judge; "but from what I have heard to-day, I
                     believe you can help to secure the right names. Now, Ben," said the Judge,
                     leaning forward and speaking in a low voice, "will you keep it a secret if I
                     make you a proposition?"</p>
                  <p>"It is natural and usual, I believe," said Benjamin, "to favor those who favor
                     us."</p>
                  <p>"Exactly so; that's the very secret! and woe be to the man who betrays
                     political confidence."</p>
                  <p>"Well, what is your proposition?" inquired Benjamin.</p>
                  <p>"It is this: take this petition, or get private letters—get the right names,
                     and the day your cousin David gets the appointment, that day I will give you
                     two hundred dollars in gold; (which in these war times you know is as good as
                     five hundred dollars and over, in greenbacks, or any United States paper;) and
                     if you want a hundred in greenbacks, to-day to use with any influential friends
                     of yours, you shall have it."</p>
                  <p>"Uncle Bailey, I have never yet offered money nor received money for political
                     influence. I have never yet solicited an office. If I am a politician, it is
                     only in the sense that I love to defend what I believe to be correct
                     principles."</p>
                  <p>"Very true, very true," interrupted the Judge; "but then you know we must use
                     the same weapons which others do, or we and our party too, might go to the
                     devil!"</p>
                  <p>"But wait a moment," said Benjamin; "what I was going to say is this: I don't
                     want your money, but there <emph>is one favor</emph> you can do me, and it will
                     cost you nothing."</p>
                  <p>"You can command me," said the Judge, "for any influence I can give you. You
                     can, Ben, I give you my word and honor."</p>
                  <p>"Then," said Benjamin, "write to William Sommers of Niagara Falls, and tell him
                     whether you have any reason to believe I ever treated any young lady in a
                     dishonorable and heartless manner!'"</p>
                  <p>As he said this he looked the Judge steadily in the<pb n="80-81"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000041"/> eye—in a way that convinced him that Benjamin
                     Bailey had not yet forgotten Laura Sommers!</p>
                  <p>The Judge was taken by surprise, but assumed great innocence of manner as he
                     replied:</p>
                  <p>"Why, what on earth do you mean, Benjamin? and where is the need of my writing
                        <emph>that</emph> to Mr. Sommers?"</p>
                  <p>"Will you do me that favor?" asked Benjamin.</p>
                  <p>"Why, yes—of course, you may refer Mr. Sommers or anybody else to me on
                     any—"</p>
                  <p>Here Benjamin interrupted the Judge, and explained all he knew about the
                     slander; and that he wanted no reference; but wanted the Judge to give him a
                     written statement respecting his habits, honesty, and good moral character—such
                     as would convince Mr. Sommers that the slanderous insinuations were without
                     foundation.</p>
                  <p>"Why, of course, Benjamin, you refer Mr. Sommers to me, and I should take
                     pleasure in writing to him that I never knew aught against you—"</p>
                  <p>"And that you do not believe there is any foundation in fact for the slander
                     which—"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I'll say all I can; just <emph>refer</emph> Mr. Sommers to me; and
                     I—"</p>
                  <p>"No, no, not <emph>refer</emph> Mr. Sommers to anybody," interrupted Benjamin,
                     as he arose and opened his secretary and produced the necessary materials for
                     writing a letter. "What I want, is, for you now to write just what you know or
                     believe about that slander, and let me send your letter <emph>with mine</emph>
                     to Mr. Sommers."</p>
                  <p>"Why, Ben, of course, I—I can't help what people may say about you or me, or
                     anybody. The least said about such matters the better. All I could say about
                     the matter is, what a certain girl told my wife."</p>
                  <p>"Then all I ask," said Benjamin, "is that you write a letter for me to send to
                     Mr. Sommers, and let him—and me, too—know who that girl is."</p>
                  <p>"Well, Benjamin, that is what I have no right to do; that would be dishonorable
                     in me to betray the confidence the girl placed in my wife, and I should never
                     betray anybody's confidence! Take a second thought, and I think you are too
                     honorable to ask it."</p>
                  <p>"Now, Judge Bailey, listen to what I tell you. It is now about one year since
                     Laura Sommers wrote me a letter throwing me aside as unworthy her confidence,
                     and all on account of that base slander. I tell you, I do not know even a
                     foundation for the insinuation; I ask you to favor me so much as to help me to
                     the facts, so I may trace it out, and you refuse under a pretense that you are
                     too <emph>honorable</emph> to betray the confidence which in this case means
                     too honorable to correct falsehood!"</p>
                  <p>"Beware! young man," said the Judge.</p>
                  <p>"Hear me, then I shall hear you," replied Benjamin. "What right," he then
                     added, "have you to aid one in concealing a wicked course because they have
                     trusted you in the secret? <q>

                  </p>
                  <p>"To say it is wrong for you to betray a wrong, is but to say it is right for
                     you to be a confederate to sustain<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6367-00000042"/> and
                     conceal that wrong, you knowing it to be such. Judge Bailey, you <emph>know
                        me,</emph> and I know you do not doubt my word. I am seeking, too, to defend
                     my reputation at the very source of this slanderous, imputation against me,
                     whatever that source may be."</p>
                  <p>"Benjamin, you have said already more than I should bear were I not in your own
                     house!" said the enraged uncle, as he rose from his chair.</p>
                  <p>"Stay," said Benjamin, "one moment, while I tell you why I do not believe that
                     you hesitate to correct that injury to me on the grounds of honor. I now fully
                     believe it is yourself who has set Mr. Sommers against me; for as nearly as I
                     can learn, you are the only one with whom he is acquainted here, except widow
                     Cummings. It is for <emph>that</emph> reason that you cannot help me to
                     contradict the slander. But unless it be contradicted, it is you who have cause
                     to fear the truth, not I."</p>
                  <p>"Young man, explain yourself!" said the Judge.</p>
                  <p>"That is what I desire to do, sir," said Benjamin.</p>
                  <p>"Do you know that I understand something of the secret of your transactions,
                     and especially of that affair on the evening I handed you the letter from Mr.
                     Baldwin one year ago and over? Be cautious, Judge Bailey, and wise enough to do
                     me justice, or the public shall know that secret, too! Will you now correct Mr.
                     Sommers' wrong impressions against me?"</p>
                  <p>"It is little matter to me," replied the Judge, "what you know; for I have
                     witnesses enough to balance your evidence. And now, rash young man, it is my
                     turn to give <emph>you</emph> warning! Hold your tongue of what you know of
                     that evening," said old Bailey, with a bold look of criminal defiance, "for
                     remember that a case in law depends upon <emph>evidence,</emph> not
                        <emph>facts!</emph> upon who has the most good witnesses, the best lawyers,
                     and the most money! And remember, I tell you to warn you, remember that when
                     you swear against me as to what you alone may know, I may find two or three
                     witnesses to contradict you, and at last convict you of perjury; and by that
                     time you will find you do not abuse gray hairs and Judge Bailey with
                     safety!"</p>
                  <p>"Now, young man, mark what I, too, have said, and it may save us both trouble,
                     if we are wise enough to come to terms. What do you say? a truce, or shall I
                     bid you good day?"</p>
                  <p>"I throw myself upon truth," said Benjamin, "and have no truce and no terms to
                     make with wrong. It serves my honest purpose to know what this interview has
                     revealed of you! When gray hairs stoop to threaten wrong, and defend wrong with
                     more wrong, they deserve less consideration than the rashness of youth."</p>
                  <p>Judge Bailey waited to hear no more, but left the library, and passing through
                     the sitting room and parlor, left the house. As he passed through the sitting
                     room, however, he turned and cautioned Benjamin to remember the warning he had
                     given him.</p>

                  <p>JUDGE BAILEY'S interview with Benjamin at the old farm-house, to secure his
                     political influence, had proven not only a failure in respect to the object of
                     his visit, but it had heaped up a combination of troublesome thoughts about
                     other matters, which greatly excited his anger; and, as he emerged from the
                     house and walked down the front yard, he manifested his excited state of mind
                     by making very singular gestures with his walking stick, which seemed entirely
                     uncalled for; also by uttering maledictions against Benjamin, and swearing that
                     Miss Sommers and his own women matters had gotten himself badly mixed up; and
                     that if Benjamin should expose him it would cost at least a thousand dollars to
                     bribe witnesses, besides the danger at his advanced age, of finishing the sale
                     of his soul to the devil; as the time he could yet hope to live might prove too
                     short for redemption! And then he broke out again with an oath:</p>
                  <p>"But only think of it," said he to himself, "the illbred young fellow dared to
                     talk to me of my faults—to <emph>me,</emph> an old man! as if a man of my
                     standing wouldn't find some way to defend himself, right or wrong. The impudent
                     young rascal! If he exposes me in that devilish affair, Adeline must swear it
                     is not so! or I'll cut off her prospects shorter than a bob-tail horse; and
                     I'll have Jerusha swear <emph>her into trouble,</emph> somehow, besides
                     swearing <emph>me out,</emph> if Adeline ever does tell the truth! But I must
                     see Adeline, right away, and give her a hint of my old witnesses, Figsley and
                     Vroman."</p>
                  <p>"What ails this infernal halter?" he inquired of the knot he had tied to fasten
                     his horse to the hitching-post. "Thank God for one thing," he muttered, "my
                        <emph>wife</emph> is still an active member of the biggest church in the
                     place, and she believes it is a religious duty to hide that infernal foolish
                     affair, or devilish crime, whatever it was! I suppose she thinks it's a pity
                     though, for people, of our standing to have to cover up things by falsehood;
                     but of course it is expected people must defend themselves; and so it is, one
                     folly, one sin, one disgrace calls out another." By this time the halter was
                     untied, the Judge was in his buggy, and away he drove, with his reflections and
                     the unsigned paper.</p>
                  <p>Benjamin was in no mood to follow the Judge to the front door to take a polite
                     parting; and as he turned and entered the sitting room he found his mother and
                     Matilda very inquisitive and curious to know what was the cause of such an
                     abrupt leave-taking; one of them introduced her inquiries by prefixing "mercy
                     on me!" and the other exclaimed:</p>
                  <p>"Now, brother Ben, what good does a quarrel do? I thought you could always keep
                     out of a quarrel!"</p>
                  <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6367-00000044"/>
                  <p>"What in the world is the matter?" inquired Mrs. Bailey, with intense
                     earnestness.</p>
                  <p>"Mother and Matilda," said Benjamin, "it was a private matter. Jared Bailey is
                     a greater villain and a bolder rascal than I took him to be; and it would
                     please me if I only knew that there was some mistake about his birth! for he is
                     meaner than any genuine Bailey could be!"</p>
                  <p>"Mercy on me! what else is going to happen to-day? What is the trouble,
                     Benjamin? Is it politics, or what is it?"</p>
                  <p>He satisfied his mother and sister with a partial explanation, and left the
                     house, saying he must give some directions to Tom, the colored man, who was at
                     work in the front yard.</p>
                  <p>Although giving directions to Tom was his ostensible object for leaving the
                     house, it is fair to presume that Benjamin had other thoughts on his mind,
                     which a little walk in the yard might tend to compose. For the turn as well as
                     the termination of the conversation with his uncle in the library, had started
                     unpleasant and perplexing thoughts.</p>
                  <p>As Benjamin approached the front gate, whence the Judge had driven away only a
                     few moments before, he noticed that Tom was busily talking to himself, and as
                     busily at work by some shrubbery near the alley. He had caught the following
                     sentences before the old colored man observed him, and it was evident that what
                     he said must have reference to Judge Bailey, who had just passed down the
                     alley</p>
                  <p>"Y-a-s! dat ole fellow wor a heap mad!" muttered Tom. "Fust time I ebber sed
                     'im <emph>here;</emph> guess it be de las' time, too! Grit out ob de way, ses
                     'e, w'en I warn't in de way a' tall. Y-a-s, I pity de werry hoss dat draws sich
                     a man! Swearin' all de way down de alley—jerkin de hosse's bridle. I hope 'e
                     git so mad 'e bite his own nose off sometime! I guess Massa Benjamin finest
                     young man <emph>he</emph> ebber seed! I wonder wat 'e means 'bout Miss
                     Somebody; he better not mean Miss Matilda, or I hit 'em five times to wonct 'e
                     come here, 'wen nobody's to home. I wish de Lord de, war would give colored
                     folks de right to defend derselves, den his ugly face ebber come here agin, an'
                     he tell me wid 'is big cane, to git out ob de way—wen I wern't <emph>in</emph>
                     de way—I knock 'm wid dis hoe to kingdom come! dat I would."</p>
                  <p>"Well, 'Uncle Tom,' what's the trouble?" interrupted Benjamin, seeing that the
                     faithful old man was not likely to make a permanent period in what he was
                     telling himself.</p>
                  <p>"O, nuffen; I wasn't sayin' nuffen to nobody, Massa Benjamin; jes talkin' to
                     myself a little, dat's all."</p>
                  <p>"What were you talking to yourself for, Tom?" said Benjamin, trying to get the
                     old colored man to explain himself.</p>
                  <p>"O, nuffen, Massa Benjamin; but you axin me wot for I is talkin' to myself,
                     makes me 'member wot ole Aunt Polly used to say w'en I was a little, small boy,
                     way down in Tennessee, on de ole plantation. 'Monstros sakes!' ses she—."</p>
                  <p>Here the old man stopped suddenly to make an apology:</p>
                  <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6367-00000045"/>
                  <p>"Wal, now, I declar', Massa Benjamin, may be taint specful for me to tell de
                     story."</p>
                  <p>"O, yes," said Benjamin, "tell us what you remember about aunt Polly; I always
                     think you mean well, uncle Tom."</p>
                  <p>"Y-a-s—dat, I allers do, Massa."</p>
                  <p>Thus encouraged, the old colored man continued, and Ben leaned against the
                     fence and listened, though in a half absent-minded way, as he took up a stick
                     and proceeded to whittle it.</p>
                  <p>"Wal, Aunt Polly allers used to say, 'monstros sakes alive! wasn't I talkin' to
                     myself 'cause der wasn't nobody else dat I was talkin' to? an' aint it ob
                     course dat w'en I'm alone I's allers in sich good company?' an' den she would
                     jes laugh herself to death, till she sot us laughin' as if we was
                        <emph>all</emph> goin' to die! But bless her ole soul, I shan't never forget
                     w'en dey whipped her little girl—poor Tilly—to death! She died right afore our
                     eyes; and den dey whipped Aunt Polly till de blood run down her back, 'cause
                     she cried so much about de cruel death ob her dear little Tilly—poor, ole Aunt
                     Polly and poor Tilly, too—de whole plantation nebber seed her laugh any
                     more!"</p>
                  <p>"That was a good many years ago, 'Uncle Tom,'" said Benjamin, as the old man
                     felt for his cotton handkerchief.</p>
                  <p>"Y-a-s, Massa Benjamin," said 'Uncle Tom,' wiping his eyes, which were dim with
                     years and dim with tears that had started at the calling of years agone!
                     "Y-a-s, dat was a good many years ago, but I 'members it plain, sef 'twas
                     to-morrow or yesterday. 'Twas afore I know'd dere was sich a good man as Gerrit
                     Smith to help de poor black man, an' dat good ole man, John Brown, what tole me
                     which way to come, an' follor de north star in de night time!"</p>
                  <p>"But, 'Uncle Tom,' you are forgetting to tell me what troubled you as I just
                     found you talking to yourself here," said Benjamin, still whittling
                     unconsciously—and his thoughts were unsteady.</p>
                  <p>"Y-a-s, now I tell ye, Massa Benjamin, dat man what come down de alley here—jes
                     drove off wid de big cane in 'is hand—he wasn't no friend to nobody, was
                     he?"</p>
                  <p>"I'm very sorry to say, 'Uncle Tom,' that he is a very bad man," was Ben's
                     reply; and he whittled harder without knowing that he whittled.</p>
                  <p>"Wal, dat what I spect, w'en he come down de alley here, swearin' and talkin',
                     an' he look so much like de hard massa dat tole 'em to whip little Tilly an'
                     Aunt Polly. O, I wish I could forget dat time, so I nebber 'member it any more!
                     Dem times wor awful hard."</p>
                  <p>"Well, 'Uncle Tom,' little Tilly was better off when she died," said Ben, while
                     the old fugitive slave paused and again felt for his cotton handkerchief.</p>
                  <p>"Y-a-s, Massa Benjamin, so she wor," continued Uncle Tom, after a moment's
                     pause, "may be de ones dat suffer most here, will had it all made up in de
                     udder world, if dey be patient, and lub de Lord in dis world, 'cause we don't

                     politician, explained to Judge Bailey by letter how he regretted that
                     influences were such that for this once, he had been obliged to disappoint him
                     about securing an office at present for his son.</p>

                  <p>THE autumn leaves, except the constant evergreen, had begun to change to the
                     tints of red and yellow, and the setting sun of a beautiful day had painted up
                     the sky in colors so grandly blended, and had so spread his influence over
                     field and forest, that, only for the knowledge that it would all so soon change
                     to dreary darkness, one could have fancied both sky and earth were the scenery
                     of heaven.</p>
                  <p>In a well-furnished room in the second story of Deacon Sommers' commodious
                     farm-house, Laura Sommers was seated alone by the side of a table on which lay
                     the materials for writing a letter. A half hour had passed away and she had not
                     written a line. She was undecided and unhappy; and as she looked out of the
                     window through the scattering trees to the west of the farm-house, the
                     beautiful sky and the softened rays of the waning day only added gloom to her
                     reflections.</p>
                  <p>She laid her pen aside, arose and approached the window, and in an audible
                     voice she said: "I <emph>cannot write</emph>—lest I shall say too much; or they
                     will, to whom I entrust my secret! I look out upon this bright world and all
                     would be happiness for me if my own thoughts<pb n="92-93"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000047"/> would let me forget how I loved him! or even if
                     I could convince my feelings that he is as bad as they told me."</p>
                  <p>And here overcome by her feelings, the tears started from her eyes; and for a
                     time she thought no more of the bright external world.</p>
                  <p>For what is brightness without when the soul is dreary within? when the lips
                     are silent for the tremor of grief that has gained control? What though we say,
                     Why submit the will to grief? When the mind is possessed with some certain
                     thoughts, so that there are no other thoughts for the time, to make the will
                     come up to change the course those thoughts drive us to pursue, whether
                     fortunate to us or not, who shall say that the will, <emph>or that which
                        produces will,</emph> can change one instant ere it does! Must not the
                     auspicious moment come? And do not the remote as well as the immediate causes
                     all have their effect to produce the state and quality of mind at the instant?
                     according to the will of Him "who hath ordered every event!"</p>
                  <p>Laura was not now thinking of the happy friends around her, her father's
                     wealth, nor her own youthful beauty; and who can say the thoughts we are
                        <emph>not</emph> thinking—<emph>they</emph> can come up to rule! And yet, as
                     it is with one, so it is in this respect, with each successive moment! and each
                     successive thought!</p>
                  <p>At last as the sun-lit scene had faded, Laura again found utterance.</p>
                  <p>"It is strange," said she, "that Benjamin Bailey is so bad and I could only
                     hear it from <emph>one</emph> family in Fallington. I don't believe it!" and
                     then she held her handkerchief chief to her face again and sobbed as she added,
                     "and yet I do! Father says he knows Judge Bailey would not say such things if
                     they were not true! and, beside that, his wife said so, too,—and she is such a
                     pious woman!</p>
                  <p>And here, as if convinced that her worst fears were true, she attempted to
                     brush away the bitter tears which came faster and faster down her cheeks, while
                     she struggled to resolve again, and perhaps for the fiftieth time, that she
                     would forget him.</p>
                  <p>As Laura was giving utterance to her feelings, she was not aware that a
                     listener stood at the partly open door of the room.</p>
                  <p>Poor Dinah,—she was indeed a faithful, simple-hearted servant; but "she had
                     eyes and ears, and she had thoughts; why should she <emph>not</emph> be
                     inquisitive as well as white girls? Besides this, Dinah felt an interest in the
                     Sommers family. She and her mother had once been the slaves of a cruel master
                     in Virginia; and Mr. Sommers was one of the Abolitionists who had aided them in
                     making their escape.</p>
                  <p>Before the Southern rebellion, Mr. Sommers had donated large sums of money and
                     given personal aid to provide means for the secret flight of slaves from their
                     masters into Canada; notwithstanding that he knew the "Fugitive Slave Law," for
                     giving any such "aid and comfort," rendered him liable to a fine of one
                     thousand dollars, and also to imprisonment.</p>
                  <p>He had in the course of those transactions, secreted Dinah and her mother from
                     their pursuers; and as Dinah was too inexperienced in housework to earn her
                     living or find ready employment, Mrs. Sommers had, at the request<pb n="94-95"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000048"/> of Dinah's mother, taken her into her own family
                     to live, and Mr. Sommers had carried the slave mother to Lewiston at night, and
                     placed her in charge of other anti-slavery men, who ferried her across the
                     smooth Niagara River, at that place, to a land of safety.</p>
                  <p>For the past five years Dinah had received from Mr. Sommers; family the same
                     wages that were given elsewhere to white servants. Her mother had been two or
                     three years married to black Jim, the fisherman, and lived in Canada, just
                     across the river; but Dinah had preferred to live in the family of Mrs.
                     Sommers; she often told her mother she "always was going to stay dah, fur she
                     didn't know what de fam'ly could do widout her!"</p>
                  <p>Dinah was emphatically an eccentric personage. Some said she was simple; others
                     that she was nobody's fool; our own opinion is, that among her multitudinous
                     freaks and sayings she sometimes said very wise things, and, like a great many
                     precocious children, she said and did a great many wiser things than she
                     herself ever comprehended, the full meaning of,—precisely as some men by making
                     very foolish blunders have acquired fortunes. One thing was certain: there was
                     none of the Sommers family who claimed for any of Dinah's numerous little
                     annoyances the dignity of impudence.</p>
                  <p>This was the listener at Laura's door.</p>
                  <p>Dinah had been sent up stairs to hand a letter to Laura which Deacon Sommers
                     had just brought home from the Niagara Falls post-office. The door, as we have
                     said, was but partly open, but the range was such as to bring Laura in full
                     view of the colored girl. Dinah stopped at the door and listened. She hid
                     herself partly behind the door, at the same time adjusting it so that she could
                     peep through the opening, with so small a section of her countenance exposed
                     that she really believed no chance look of Laura's would discover her
                     inquisitiveness.</p>
                  <p>As Dinah caught Laura's words, she grew more and more eager to know the cause
                     of her troubles. At first she looked, then she applied her ears to the crevice,
                     and the next instant she directed her eyes toward Laura. She grew excited, and
                     her dark eye-lids peeled themselves back till the white of her eye-balls shone
                     fearfully around their dark centers.</p>
                  <p>"What in the worl" said she, in an exclamatory whisper, "am de matter wid my
                     missus Laura! She 'pears awful strange—what dat?—what dat she sayin! De lord ob
                     lub!—why don't I keep still, now—so I hear dat?"</p>
                  <p>"It must be true," said Laura; and if 'tis, their judgment is right."</p>
                  <p>"Hark, now, what dat she say 'bout de Judgement!" mattered Dinah, beginning to
                     be superstitiously alarmed—not catching her meaning, and fancying just then she
                     heard a noise in the dark closet at the end of the hall.</p>
                  <p>"But," continued Laura, just then raising her handkerchief again to her eyes,
                     "I did not, no, I did not like what the Judge said the last day—I was
                     there."</p>
                  <p>As Laura was speaking the words "<emph>Judge said the last day,</emph>" Dinah's
                     superstitious fears were confirmed; she heard the noise in the dark closet
                     plainer than before; while her ideas of Laura and of the white handkerchief
                        to<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6367-00000049"/> Laura's face now reached a state
                     of actual confusion and fright; and she ran away from the door and down stairs
                     as fast as she could go.</p>
                  <p>Deacon Sommers was in the sitting-room reading to Mrs. Sommers the news from
                     the armies in the South. He had just finished reading an account of the
                     surrender of Fort Wagner to General Gilmore, when Dinah rushed into the
                     sitting-room, not venturing to stop till she reached the dining-room door, and
                     exclaiming in a loud whisper, as if afraid the causes of her fright would
                     overhear her:</p>
                  <p>"O, I's done scart to def! Der is suffin in de dark closet—an Miss Laura—is
                     cryin' 'bout de Judge an' de last day! O, I's so awfully—"</p>
                  <p>"What do you say about Laura, you foolish thing!" asked Mrs. Sommers with a
                     puzzled expression, as she moderately proceeded to go up stairs.</p>
                  <p>"I don't believe she has seen Laura," said Deacon Sommers.</p>
                  <p>"Scart," continued Dinah, "dat I can't hardly say nuffin—an'—an' Miss Laura was
                     stan' in' afore the winder—wid a white cloth over her face. O, I's so fear'd
                     she done gone crazy—cryin' an' talkin' herself to def—and suffin white on her
                     face—jes sef she wur goin' to be a talkin' ghost! O, I's so sorry for Miss
                     Laura—go up dah, too, Mister Sommers."</p>
                  <p>"Never mind, Dinah, you are <emph>frightened</emph> about something."</p>
                  <p>"Dat's what I's sayin', Mister Sommers. I's fear'd Miss Laura is haunted, by
                     suffen, in de dark closet!"</p>
                  <p>By this time Mr. Sommers started toward the stairway and Mrs. Sommers had met
                     Laura at the head of the stairs. A few minutes later and all was explained.
                     Laura was not a ghost, with a white cloth over her face; and the dark closet up
                     stairs was all right, as it is in anybody's house. Dinah was sent into the
                     kitchen; Deacon Sommers resumed his reading; and Laura was in possession of the
                     letter which Dinah through all her inquisitiveness and fright, had clung to
                     like a faithful keeper.</p>
                  <p>As Dinah went out of the sitting-room she was somewhat ashamed of her fright,
                     and she muttered in a confused way, as if partly willing to be heard:</p>
                  <p>"Well, I know'd 'twasn't nuffen', anyhow, but suffen' was de matter; 'twouldn't
                     be nuffen strange if de house <emph>was</emph> ha'nted when dey keep, de rooms
                     so dark to scare de flies out. What if de sun-light do fade de carpets, dat
                     aint spooks!"</p>
                  <p>Our round, revolving world, had not yet hidden all the evening light behind the
                     western arch of lake, land and forest, when Laura returned to the window where
                     she stood when Dinah was her listener.</p>
                  <p>She saw from the post-mark on the letter just handed her that it was mailed at
                     New York city, from which place Fallington was not many miles distant. The
                     address was in a strange hand; she opened the letter; the letter, too, was in a
                     strange hand, but evidently that of some intelligent lady. The letter was a
                     long one, and she immediately turned to the bottom of the last page to see the
                     name of the writer; it was written Mrs. Hellen Hartley. It was a name she had
                     no recollection of whatever.</p>
                  <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6367-00000050"/>
                  <p>"Hellen Hartley! I wonder who Hellen Hartley is?" said Laura, as she laid the
                     letter upon the table and proceeded to light a lamp.</p>
                  <p>"I wish," said Laura, as she touched a match-blaze to the lamp-wick, "that some
                     of these Pennsylvania oil wells would strike something nicer than this
                        <emph>outlandish</emph> kerosene, or they would find some way to get the
                     musk out of it! I prefer geranium myself. What a world this is; it is a good
                     thing that trouble doesn't trouble us any more than it does," added Laura, as
                     she seated herself, and taking up the letter from Mrs. Hartley, she read as

                              <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Dear Stranger—I feel it is my duty to reveal to you
                                 something about Judge Bailey in Fallington. It may be important to
                                 your happiness for life. But as I do not wish to have my name mixed
                                 up with any scandal, I want you and your family to consider this
                                 letter confidential. I venture it to do by you as I would like
                                 another to do by me.</p>
                              <p>"Last July I made a visit to Mrs. Judge Bailey's in Fallington. It
                                 happened I got there the next day after you left. I heard the
                                 family speak of you and saw your photograph.</p>
                              <p>"I had been there about two weeks, when, one evening, as I stood by
                                 the window reading a newspaper, Judge Bailey gave me a gross
                                 insult. I immediately left the room, and meeting Mrs. Bailey
                                 informed her of the insult, and to my astonishment, she at first
                                 treated the matter lightly, and then intimated that if I chose to
                                 bring scandal upon myself by catching up 'such <emph>little
                                    matters,</emph>' I would find it would injure no one but myself;
                                 that they <emph>would</emph> tell as much against me as I dare tell
                                 against them, and that I would find that they would swear to it,
                                 too, to defend their honor, <emph>whether it was true or
                                    not,</emph> so if I did not wish to injure myself I had better
                                 keep such matters quiet. I then went to my room, but remembering
                                 that the adjoining room was over the sitting-room, and that a
                                 stove-pipe came through the floor, I went there to listen, thinking
                                 the insult gave me a right to hear what they would say of it.</p>
                              <p>"I will now write you part of what I heard. 'Well, if she makes a
                                 fuss about it,' said Mr. Bailey, 'you and Jerusha must swear me
                                 clear. You remember what our lawyer said I need only prove. No
                                 matter whether it is true or not, evidence is evidence! If I can
                                 make out she was to blame, of course it will be nothing to her
                                 credit. Tell her then, boldly, that you and Jerusha will swear her
                                 into trouble if she is mean enough to get us into trouble.' I
                                 suppose she meant Jerusha Vroman. Only think! and she seemed to be
                                 such a conscientious girl. Only think! he abuse me, and then defend
                                 himself by slandering me!</p>
                              <p>"But pretty soon they got to talking on what may concern you. I
                                 overheard Mrs. Bailey say, 'Jared, I wish David was married to
                                 Laura Sommers before you disgrace us all. This is not the only
                                 time, Jared, that you've acted like an insane man, and promised it
                                    should<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6367-00000051"/> be the last!
                                 Who knows but Benjamin Bailey knew Adeline's voice when you abused
                                 her in the hall the time he handed you the letter? Suppose Adeline
                                 should ever get sick, and light-headed, or talk in her sleep about
                                 that, or the way we got our property?' Then the next thing I heard
                                 was Mr. Bailey saying, 'As for Mrs. Hartley, [that's my name,] her
                                 father expects all his children to have some of my property, so
                                 there is no danger of his listening to anything against
                                    <emph>me,</emph> even if he knew it were true. But I'll promise
                                 to will Mrs. Hartley the Hill house and lot if she'll stand by us.'
                                 'No, you can't do that,' said Mrs. Bailey, 'for you've promised
                                 that to Jerusha.' 'Of course I did,' said he, 'and Jerusha will get
                                 it; that is, if she does exactly as I wish her to do, and I don't
                                 change my mind. But if I need her and Adeline to contradict
                                 anything, they must be on hand. <emph>They</emph> talk about
                                 conscience! What's the use of talking about conscience when a thing
                                 has <emph>got to be done? I've had</emph> to promise to will the
                                    <emph>same</emph> property to a dozen different ones in the
                                 course of a few years! <emph>But I had to do it!</emph>' 'Well, no
                                 matter,' said Mrs. Bailey, 'they will not know who gets it till
                                 after we are dead and gone, and they will not bark much after it is
                                 too late to do us any hurt or themselves any good.'</p>
                              <p>"They went on in this way sometime. Finally I heard Jared Bailey
                                 say, 'David shall not have that Henriette Smith, and if she sues
                                 him for breach of promise we must swear him out of it!' 'No,' said
                                 his wife, 'I will not swear to what is not so, <emph>except to save
                                    ourselves or the property;</emph> not for any little thing. And
                                 we don't know as Laura Sommers would have David; and David says all
                                 he would have her for is her property!' 'Well, that's enough,' said
                                 Jared Bailey, 'and we don't want any such poor trash in the family
                                 as Henriette Smith. Of course she'll feel bad—good girl enough—but
                                 she is not used to such society as we keep.'</p>
                              <p>"But, Miss Sommers, I've written enough to warn you what they are.
                                 If you doubt what I say, perhaps you can find out something from
                                 Adeline Wilderman or others there near them.</p>

                     Things—How and why Concealed—Judge Bailey—More about the Will Fraud.</head>
                  <p>"My stars!" exclaimed Laura Sommers, in surprise, as she finished reading the
                     letter from Mrs. Hellen Hartley, which closed the last chapter, "if they are
                     such folks as that, there is not a word of truth in what they told me—about
                     Benjamin; and it is a credit to him and his folks that they do not visit there!
                     Why, how I must have hurt his feelings, and how unreasonable he must have
                     thought us not to let him even have a chance to defend himself! David Bailey! I
                     would not marry him if he were a statue of gold! To say the best, he is only a
                     smart simpleton; his want of good sense has been rendered the more ridiculous
                     by a <emph>little</emph> education! And if that were not so, I don't like the
                     expression of his face. I would rather marry Col. Le Grange, and have him go
                     right off to the army and get shot—so far as <emph>I</emph> would be
                     concerned—though, of course, I don't wish him any <emph>harm.</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"I'll go and hand this letter to mother, and see what she thinks of it. And
                     then I'll hand it to father and see what he thinks of it. Why! I can hardly
                     believe my eyes."</p>
                  <p>When Laura reached the sitting-room she found her father and mother alone; and
                     holding the letter in her hand as she advanced toward them, she said:</p>
                  <p>"Here, father and mother, is a remarkable letter, which makes things look to me
                     as if we have all been deceived by Judge Bailey—and by Mrs. Bailey, too,
                     instead of mother and I having been deceived in our good opinion of Benjamin
                     Bailey when we were visiting in Fallington."</p>
                  <p>Deacon Sommers gave a puzzled look over his spectacles, toward Laura and the
                     letter, and the next moment he said, "let me read it, daughter."</p>
                  <p>"Who is it from?" asked her mother.</p>
                  <p>"It is from an entire stranger to me—but some acquaintance, it appears, of
                     Judge Bailey's family," replied Laura, handing the letter to her father, "and
                     my stars! you will not believe your own senses when you read it."</p>
                  <p>Deacon Sommers laid aside his newspaper. The hundreds of soldiers which had
                     been killed in late battles were for a moment forgotten. Two of his own sons
                     who had just enlisted, but who had not yet been ordered to the front, were also
                     out of mind; and Laura's matrimonial affairs now claimed the moment's
                     attention.</p>
                  <p>Everybody had begun to look upon the sufferings and upon the dangers of the war
                     as something that could not be averted. The horrors of actual warfare made less
                     excitement now than the first gun at Fort Sumter. And a hundred soldiers now
                     killed in battle took less hold on the public feeling than the first soldier
                     killed in the Massachusetts Sixth Regiment, at the Baltimore railroad depot in
                     1861, while on their way to the defense of Washington.</p>
                  <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6367-00000053"/>
                  <p>Such is human nature. The soldier himself, though he shudder in the first
                     moments of battle, he soon looks on and fights on in the midst of blood,
                     carnage and death, without fear or falter! So the public, too, had come to look
                     to matters of civil life, and forget, at times, the horrible state of
                     internecine war. So it was that Deacon Sommers laid aside even the news from
                     the armies in the South, to read a letter that told of Laura's lover.</p>
                  <p>Deacon Sommers read the letter deliberately and aloud. Mrs. Sommers listened
                     with eager interest. Both were surprised at the contents. Mrs. Sommers
                     expressed her opinion that Judge Bailey was a mean man, and she guessed her
                     first impressions would turn out to be correct, after all.</p>
                  <p>"Don't be too fast, wife," interrupted Deacon Sommers, "what do we know about
                     this Mrs. Hellen Hartley? And, besides that, she does not contradict a single
                     thing that is said against Benjamin Bailey."</p>
                  <p>"Father," said Laura, "doesn't that letter show that Judge Bailey is mean
                     enough to tell what is not true?"</p>
                  <p>"And doesn't it show," added Mrs. Sommers, "that his object was to help David
                     get Laura for a wife?"</p>
                  <p>"But," replied Deacon Sommers, "it appears David has made no demonstrations to
                     support that suspicion; and even if he had, is it likely that the Judge and his
                     wife would dare state what they could not prove, and what others could show is
                     false? It does seem to me a strange freak that a sensible girl, like Laura,
                     should fall in love with a stranger, like Benjamin Bailey, when she has offers
                     among acquaintances like Col. Le Grange and young Smith, persons of wealth and
                     standing."</p>
                  <p>"Then you do not think, father, that it is best to notice this Mrs. Hartley's
                     letter, do you?" asked Laura, with some surprise.</p>
                  <p>"Why, as to that, if I had good reason to believe that Benjamin Bailey is a
                     young man of good morals, good intelligence, good standing, good business
                     abilities, and good habits, and entertaining good orthodox sentiments,
                     and—"</p>
                  <p>"Why, goodness sakes! father, there is not anything else good that can be
                     added," interrupted Laura, in a respectful, but thoughtful manner.</p>
                  <p>"And," resumed the Deacon, "if his means be such as we would think desirable
                     for one like Laura—who has always had everything she wanted—why, then, I should
                     consider it important to inquire into to the matter; this is, if you are
                     determined not to be happy any other way."</p>
                  <p>"As to his means, father, I think a young man of his good habits, with the good
                     sense he has, would be capable of taking care of me, and also help me to take
                     care of what property you, my dear father, are intending shall go with your
                     daughter."</p>
                  <p>"But, father, I <emph>would</emph> like to ask of you one favor. Will you write
                     to Benjamin and give him the privilege to explain Judge Bailey's charges?"</p>
                  <p>"I do not think that is necessary; at least, not till we find out from other
                     sources that Judge Bailey's statements are not reliable."</p>
                  <p>"Well, I can write," said Laura, "to that Adeline Wilderman, which this letter
                     refers to, and perhaps we shall find out that Judge Bailey is a worse man than
                        even<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6367-00000054"/> Mrs. Hartley intimates. And,
                     mother, will you write to Mrs. Cummings, and tell her confidentially about this
                     letter, and ask her to write you what she can find against Judge Bailey,
                     towards showing that Mrs. Hartley's letter is true in all it says? I tell you,
                     father, that Judge Bailey does not seem exactly like a saint to me since I've
                     got my suspicions up!"</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Sommers thought it might be well enough to make some investigation, and
                     finally Deacon Sommers himself said he would make some inquiries by addressing
                     the minister at Fallington, and hoped Laura would then be satisfied.</p>
                  <p>Deacon Sommers was not a very impulsive man; and even if he had been, it is not
                     likely that he, with man's characteristic habit of looking into the minute
                     points of a tangled case, and pondering out a conclusion after complicating the
                     difficulty by this and that, or some other query—not likely he would have come
                     to so quick or positive an opinion as to what notice he ought to take of Mrs.
                     Hartley's remarkable letter, as his daughter did; for, Laura, with woman's
                     quick decision, dispatched a letter of inquiry early the next morning to
                     Adeline Wilderman.</p>
                  <p>Five days, or at farthest a week, she considered sufficient time to get a
                     reply, but more than two weeks passed and no reply came. Had she offended
                     Adeline Wilderman by writing as a stranger should not? She had written that
                     Judge Bailey had informed her father of some things which it was important that
                     her father should know positively if they were true. Would she be kind enough
                     to write a reply, and let her know whether the Bailey family in Fallington
                     village could be relied on in all they said against the Baileys who lived about
                     a mile from the village. "We have received," wrote Laura, "some startling
                     information against Judge Bailey. Do you know how he obtained so much property?
                     I have just received a letter from a lady stranger, who tells me you know
                     something of his private character, and as you had been badly abused by him,
                     you might write me some particulars, as it is important to me to know whether
                     his statements can be relied on!"</p>
                  <p>It may be, reflected Laura, as she thought over these and other things she had
                     written—it may be that this Adeline, though she has been abused, may have some
                     reasons—some interest in saying nothing against Mrs. Judge Bailey's family; or
                     it may be—for it has certainly been long enough for me to have a reply—I was
                     not careful enough in what I wrote, to avoid casting any reflections against
                     her in supposing her to have so much knowledge of such a man's secret history.
                     It does seem, said Laura, to herself, that some things, however innocently
                     intended, and no matter how necessary to inquire about, cannot be spoken of
                     even to innocent parties, without giving them offense; but I cannot help it; it
                     is right I should know, and wrong somewhere if I am deceived. And how shall I
                     know whom to believe, if I must make no inquiries?</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Sommers now wrote her cousin, Gertrude Cummings, some inquiries; and
                     Deacon Sommers wrote to the Presbyterian minister at Fallington.</p>
                  <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6367-00000055"/>
                  <p>It would seem that the marriage of one's daughter—a matter which might effect
                     the happiness or misery of her life-time—ought to have suggested that Mr.
                     Sommers go himself to Fallington, especially when there did appear cause for
                     doubt, and learn, if possible, from personal interviews, the truth of matters.
                     But such a course had not yet suggested itself.</p>
                  <p>The idea of any deep-laid plot to deceive them, such as novel writers invent,
                     of course was not going to affect <emph>their</emph> family. What they would be
                     told by Mrs. Cummings and the minister would be true, of course! And the idea
                     of Judge Bailey and his wife both attempting to deceive Mrs. Cummings and the
                     minister by some indirect method in order to deceive others, through them, was
                     not likely to be suspected.</p>
                  <p>Two days after Laura Sommers had written her letter Adeline Wilderman was
                     reading it. Poor Adeline—poor woman! But I cannot in this volume take room to
                     give you the particulars of her life; you shall, however, be able to infer that
                     if ever woman had struggled to cover up the faults, and even the crimes of a
                     man once her guardian, lest his exposure would render another unhappy whom she
                     tried to think had treated her like a mother, and perhaps even drag Adeline
                     herself into the general disgrace which might come about by the blunders of
                     guessing gossipers and erroneous suspicion—that woman was Adeline Wilderman.
                     She had seen trouble enough! It was natural that she should shun the appearance
                     of more. Hence the hasty dispatch of Laura's letter, together with the neglect
                     of Deacon Sommers in writing, were unfortunate circumstances. The former became
                     the cause of giving Judge Bailey notice of impending trouble; the latter
                     afforded him time to plan a concealment of facts; and for a time a successful
                     game of bold, deep and mean deception it was.</p>
                  <p>For his success, however, he was mainly indebted to his wife and Jerusha
                     Vroman. They suggested the plan, and the three carried it out. One or two of
                     Mrs. Hartley's own relatives were immediately bribed, and otherwise influenced
                     to say with apparently serious regret, that Mrs. Hartley was a <emph>strange
                        woman;</emph> that her story against Judge Bailey really belonged to another
                     family, and that she had applied it to Judge Bailey's family out of spite. This
                     explanation seemed plausible, and partly with this success they succeeded in
                     silencing and perhaps deceiving Mrs. Cummings and the minister's family. In
                     this and other ways they not only covered up the facts, but injured Mrs.
                     Hartley's reputation, for making any complaint about the abuse she had received
                     from Judge Bailey, and for disclosing what she had overheard.</p>
                  <p>It may be that Judge Bailey's conscience reproved him for slandering one he had
                     provoked to speak the truth; but had he not the heart years before to sacrifice
                     poor Eleanor Grace! and had he not continued to hold a hard hand over Adeline's
                     fears?</p>
                  <p>Adeline's experience, or rather her broken spirits, had prepared her to
                     silently "endure what she could not cure." She did not, therefore, deem it
                     advisable for her to disclose anything in reply to Laura's letter.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes she had thought it to be her duty to expose<pb n="110-111"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000056"/> wrong—to tell what she knew. But she was almost
                     helpless and friendless; and though she had been cruelly wronged by Mr. and
                     Mrs. Jared Bailey, it would, she thought, only make the matter worse to turn
                     even their selfish friendship into desperate anger against her. Often had she
                     thought over the time when she lived in their family; how she had concealed
                     what she knew of his procuring a fraudulent will from a dying man, and how she
                     had been induced to sign the will as a witness.</p>
                  <p>Some twelve years prior to the time of the will-fraud, and when Adeline was
                     seven years of age, Jared Bailey and his wife took little Adeline into their
                     family, pledging her dying mother—and that mother a widowed sister of Mrs.
                     Bailey—that they would care for her child as for their own daughter. And yet
                     all the trouble she has ever known has been caused by being too true to those
                     who made and broke that promise.</p>
                  <p>It is now nearly twenty years since she left the rich Jared Bailey's house and
                     learned the trade of a dressmaker, that she might be independent of him. It was
                     her intention then to expose the will-fraud and the defensive falsehoods of
                     Jared Bailey and wife against poor Eleanor Grace, who had spoken the truth. But
                     her resolution, had it been carried out, came too late to have benefited
                     Eleanor. She had mysteriously disappeared! And Adeline, by fear and favor, was
                     finally influenced to a silence not yet broken.</p>
                  <p>Jared Bailey's successful attempt to defraud his relatives, (successful unless
                     the bitter end was to come,) and the heartless means by which he had sacrificed
                     Eleanor, and silenced Adeline, were not the only private acts of a similar
                     character which he was guilty of. But blundering gossip knew so little of any
                     facts against him that when it made its blundering reports, dependent friends
                     pretended not to believe it, and said in ridicule of gossip, "people will talk,
                     you know!"</p>
                  <p>It was strange how Jared Bailey had got on so well as he had in the general,
                     seeming favor of society. It was, however, probably owing to two causes; he was
                     rich and cunning. But, then, he was vain and haughty, and tyrannical when his
                     selfish desires were opposed; and he was illiberal except that his selfish and
                     passionate love of female society led him to many acts of apparent generosity
                     and kindness. He was one of those men who would shed tears over the sufferings
                     of a beautiful lady stranger, sooner than give a dime to the starving children
                     of a washer-woman. And so long as any young lady made her diamonds glitter in
                     his house, and also flattered his vanity by even virtuous coquetry, so long he
                     counted her board and trouble nothing, and his carriage or his saddle-horse was
                     at her service and he her humble servant.</p>

                     Letter to Laura Sommers.</head>
                  <p>WITH the knowledge which Adeline possessed of Jared Bailey, and of the course
                     which had been taken to cover up his crimes, she was prepared to put the worst
                     construction possible upon the vague allusions in Laura's letter. "Perhaps,"
                     thought she, "that unprincipled Mr. Figsley from Canada, who made out the
                     papers when that poor, sick man signed the wills in Mr. Bailey's house, has
                     said something—has exposed how it was about the two wills! My soul on me! what
                     if there should be trouble, and I brought up as a witness, and then if I swore
                     to the truth John Vroman and that Figsley would swear that I had committed
                     perjury, as Mr. Bailey says they would all have to do in self-defense, and put
                     me in prison!" Adeline's imagination was thus busily at work with unpleasant
                     forebodings when she heard a knock at the door.</p>
                  <p>She answered the call; and Mrs. Judge Bailey, followed by her husband, entered
                     the room. The usual formalities followed. Mrs. Bailey put on a little more than
                     her usually smooth and friendly manner. After a little preliminary conversation
                     Adeline was about to speak of the letter which she had just received, but the
                     Judge announced his errand first.</p>
                  <p>"Adeline," he said, "you know what my motto is—when a thing has got to be done,
                     or has been done, there is no use to talk about conscience. What is conscience,
                     any way? Our consciences depend on our judgment, education, etc. We cannot
                     always tell by conscience what it is best to do. Why, the preachers this
                     moment, in the South, are all praying for one side of this war, while the
                     preachers in the North are praying for the other side. One side for slavery,
                     which is a devilish sight worse robbery than the will matters you so often
                     refer to."</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Bailey," said Adeline, "you call selfishness conscience; and you argue in
                     favor of doing wrong on purpose, because we do wrong sometimes ignorantly. That
                     is your way—not mine."</p>
                  <p>"Well, Adeline," said Mrs. Bailey," "there is one thing you and I both believe
                     in—friends must hang together."</p>
                  <p>"Yes," interrupted Adeline, as her eyes flashed toward Judge Bailey, "for if
                     they did not hang together, some one, almost, would hang alone! or get some
                     other punishment!"</p>
                  <p>But Judge Bailey never appropriated a rebuke which he could possibly think
                     might mean others instead of himself. He knew that Mrs. Bailey and Adeline did
                     not dare to expose him under any circumstances; and to any rebuke from them he
                     usually replied, "the least said the better," and this with a smile that always
                     reminded Adeline of that often quoted line— <q>
                        <l>"A man may smile and smile and be a villain."</l>
                     </q>
                     <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6367-00000058"/> For the opinion or the feelings of
                     those whom he had wronged, but whom he knew would not expose him, he cared
                     nothing; and yet he cared as much as he could care; it was not in his nature to
                     care, and Mrs. Bailey pitied him! She loved him. And she had been known to say
                     respecting him and Miss Vroman, "let them who are without sin cast the first
                     stone," and "let us forgive as we hope to be forgiven!"</p>
                  <p>"We have come here," said the Judge to Adeline, "to ask a favor of you; for,
                     you know we have been doing you favors almost all your life time."</p>
                  <p>"Jared Bailey!" said Adeline, with a wild stare, "I am in no mood to listen to
                     your deliberate impudence; and before I die you may fear me as I have feared
                     you!"</p>
                  <p>"Hush, hush, now, dear Adeline," interrupted Mrs. Bailey, "do be quiet, now!
                     Don't expose anything for my sake, and your own, too. You know, Adeline, that
                     Mr. Bailey can secure all the witnesses, and you none; and now don't, for your
                     sake and mine, too! I don't approve of it, but how can I help myself?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, then," returned Adeline, angrily, "does he taunt me about
                        <emph>favors</emph>—as if he could make me forget the <emph>injuries</emph>
                     he has done me! Did he not defraud me of the two thousand dollars which was in
                     the real will which that poor, dying man thought he was signing?"</p>
                  <p>"And haven't we," interrupted Mrs. Jared Bailey, "paid you more than Mortimer
                     Bailey promised you?"</p>
                  <p>"And haven't you extorted money enough out of me, added Judge Bailey, "for a
                     little affair, lately, which you called a thousand times worse than it was? and
                     haven't I for more than twenty years paid you the interest on that 'two
                     thousand dollars'?"</p>
                  <p>"But where is the principal?" said Adeline, "and what reliance can I place in
                     the future on a man like you, who destroyed poor Eleanor Grace by falsehood,
                     which robbed her of a young man who would have made her a kind and worthy
                     husband? you who drove me into signing a false will as a witness, and ever
                     since have frightened me into this long silence, by saying the act made me as
                     guilty as the rest of you. If I am a criminal, you have made me such, through
                     fear and ignorance of laws; while it has made you rich and me wretched!" And,
                     then turning to Mrs. Bailey, she added, "and to frighten me into silence about
                     that insane assault, did he not bribe Jerusha Vroman to tell me, after all I
                     did for her, that she would swear to things—true or false—to defend him; and
                     didn't you intimate the same?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, Adeline!" said Mrs. Bailey, "you don't—you can't blame us! What else
                     could we do?"</p>
                  <p>"Adeline," said Judge Bailey, "you act like—purgatory! What's up worse than
                     usual?"</p>
                  <p>"This is what's up for you," Adeline replied, producing the letter from Laura
                     Sommers. "You can read it for yourself, Mr. Bailey. <emph>You are already
                        exposed!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"Good Lord!" exclaimed Mrs. Bailey; and Judge Bailey reached out his trembling
                     hand for the letter; and when he had read only a part of it his guilty
                     conscience forced him to fear the worst. Mrs. Bailey noticed that he turned
                     pale, and she stepped to his chair. The next instant the letter dropped from
                     his hand; he uttered a<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6367-00000059"/> groan; Mrs.
                     Bailey supported him in the chair, and cried out:</p>
                  <p>"O, Adeline! he is dying! he is dying! get the camphor. O, my dear husband,
                     what's the good of all our property, now? O, what shall we do!"</p>
                  <p>As Adeline was hunting up the camphor bottle, she muttered, "I'm afraid it's
                     only a fit—of his conscience! But if it be the apoplexy—it's awful for such a
                     man to die—such a hypocrite as he has been. The Lord's will be done, though!
                     only I hope he won't die here!"</p>
                  <p>"Do find the camphor, Adeline!"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, here it is;" and then she applied the resuscitating remedy to his nose
                     and head, and chimed in with Mrs. Bailey:</p>
                  <p>"O, what shall we do! what shall we do! if he dies here," said Adeline.</p>
                  <p>In a few moments, however, he began to revive, and was soon so far restored
                     that by the assistance of Adeline and Mrs. Bailey he walked home.</p>
                  <p>The next day Mrs. Judge Bailey sent for Adeline, requesting her to bring the
                     letter with her. Adeline went. The letter which Judge Bailey had not finished
                     reading the evening previous was now read, and read again; but after
                     considerable discussion he decided that it was very vague in its meaning;
                     especially about the property. It was decided, however, that Mrs. Hellen
                     Hartley's statements must be put down.</p>
                  <p>Adeline was again threatened and promised. If she stood by them she would have
                     five thousand dollars willed to her; and when she needed anything it should be
                     got for her. And if she did not defend them they would all have to turn against
                     her and give her nothing!</p>
                  <p>Adeline was once more persuaded—and frightened—and she promised that she would
                     disclose nothing! "But," said she, "I tell you, Mr. Bailey, and mark what I
                     say, '<emph>your sin will find you out!</emph>'"</p>
                  <p>"That may be," said Judge Bailey, "but, Adeline, we cannot help the past, and
                     we must finish up what we have on hand. You know that John Vroman still lives
                     at Niagara Falls. Of course I don't fear him. But, that Figsley, on the Canada
                     side; it costs me a good deal every year to keep him still. Now, here comes up
                     Benjamin Bailey, attempting to make the acquaintance of the daughter of William
                     Sommers. Should he succeed in his object, he would, of course, finally become
                     acquainted with Mrs. Hartley's letter, and that allusion to the property might
                     revive, in fact it would be sure to revive the old suspicions—and suspicions
                     might start inquiry—then if Deacon Sommers should join with Benjamin against us
                     he might supply means; and Figsley has got to be just dishonorable enough to
                     turn against us! He makes a great many threats lately, and even keeps up the
                     old matter about Eleanor Grace—pretends <emph>he</emph> didn't want things
                     carried so far—that there was enough of us to cover up the facts and her
                     statements, too, without turning her out doors just for being off her guard and
                     telling the truth! He says if we hadn't turned her out doors she would have
                     finally consented to be Mrs. Figsley; and every time he gets in a rage he
                     threatens that Eleanor shall have vengeance on me yet, and that her
                        mysterious<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6367-00000060"/> disappearance will
                     come to light yet, as well as papers enough to defend her character; and all
                     this, when at first, you know Figsley tried to put down her statements himself!
                     He's a treacherous <emph>villain,</emph>" said the <emph>innocent</emph> Mr.
                     Jared Bailey, with as much assurance as if it indicated some virtue in himself
                     to denounce the now dissipated and disreputable Figsley! "But," he added,
                     partly with a view to keep Adeline intimidated to silence, "we are all in the
                     treacherous villain's power, for I've no doubt he was just cautious enough to
                     save as many letters and papers as he needed to injure us with."</p>
                  <p>"So it won't answer to have Deacon Sommers turn against us. And there is only
                     one safe course for us all to take. We must at all hazards prevent Benjamin
                     from having any communication with that family. If necessary, Jerusha must
                     write Mrs. Sommers that she is the young lady whom we have said Benjamin
                     treated so shamefully. Then I must get some of Mrs. Hartley's friends to put
                     discredit on what she wrote. The other thing to be done is to have Deacon
                     Sommers interested in our favor by our bringing about David's marriage instead
                     of Benjamin's with Laura Sommers. You know, Adeline, Mrs. Bailey and Jerusha
                     and myself have already managed to break off all correspondence between
                     Benjamin and the Sommers family; though I confess there isn't much prospect of
                     David's success in the place of it."</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Bailey," interrupted Adeline, "I shall have nothing to do with the matter;
                     nor do I know anything against Benjamin Bailey."</p>
                  <p>"Have I not told you that Benjamin is no friend of yours?" said Mrs.
                     Bailey.</p>
                  <p>"And haven't I told you," said Judge Bailey, with a falsehood on his tongue,
                     "how he talks against you and Jerusha? About that little difficulty I had with
                     you the evening he came to the door to hand me the letter, and you talked so
                     loud—of course I've acknowledged to you that I was to blame—."</p>
                  <p>"And at the same time," interrupted Adeline, "you threatened to prove by
                     Jerusha Vroman that <emph>I</emph> was to blame!"</p>
                  <p>"Well, no matter," said Mrs. Bailey, "he was generous enough by you at
                     last!"</p>
                  <p>"But what I was going to say," resumed Judge Bailey, "was this: Benjamin
                     Bailey, at the time I talked with him in his library, a little while ago, spoke
                     of the affair in a way to disgrace <emph>you</emph> as well as me. Now my plan
                     is, (if we find it necessary,) to represent to Mr. Sommers that Benjamin on
                     that evening came to see Jerusha, and after treating her in a very dishonorable
                     way, so that I afterwards forbid him the house, he got up that story to injure
                     us all. As for Mrs. Hartley's letter—Jerusha's plan is a good one—we must all
                     declare she told us the same or a similar story about one of her best friends
                     in New York city, and that some of her own family say she is half crazy!"</p>
                  <p>"Jerusha can tell that story if she pleases," said Adeline, "but I can't, and I
                     won't! The worst you can get <emph>me</emph> to say is, to say nothing, just
                     the best way I know how!"</p>
                  <p>Not long after the above events Mrs. Cummings called on Adeline, and the
                     minister's wife called on Mrs. Cummings<pb n="120-121"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000061"/> mings; and Mrs. Bailey called on Mrs. Cummings
                     and also on the minister's wife, and Jerusha called around also. Deacon Sommers
                     had written to the minister. Adeline Wilderman had written to Laura Sommers a
                     reply which amounted to nothing—precisely what she intended it should amount
                     to. Mrs. Cummings' reply to Laura's mother amounted to this: she had known
                     nothing for or against Benjamin Bailey till within the last two weeks; but if
                     what she had heard a certain young lady say was true, he must be a fellow
                     without honor or principle. All she had heard Mrs. Judge Bailey say, was, that
                     she felt very sorry Benjamin was turning out so badly. And from what she could
                     hear from Judge Bailey's family she should think no dependence ought to be
                     placed on Mrs. Hartley's letter."</p>

                              <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Dear Sir—Yours of the 7th instant, inquiring
                                 confidentially about Judge Bailey's present standing, etc., etc.,
                                 was received a few days since. In reply I must say, that I know
                                 nothing positively against him. He claims that the stories are all
                                 gotten up by his enemies. The rumors in circulation do not, so far
                                 as I have learned, gain much credit. His family attend church
                                 pretty regularly, and go in the very best society. There is no
                                 family here that does more to sustain the church. If any part of
                                 what is talked be true, it is probable that the stories are greatly
                                 exaggerated. Last Sabbath the Judge and his wife both partook of
                                 the Lord's supper. It is true, however, that the Judge himself is
                                 seldom seen in the prayer meeting, but his wife and Miss Vroman are
                                 often there, and Mrs. Bailey appears to be one of the finest ladies
                                 I ever knew. My wife has just inquired of her about Mrs. Hartley,
                                 and Mrs. Bailey says that Mrs. Hartley became greatly enraged
                                 because, they did not like to associate with her, so they presume
                                 that what she wrote your daughter against Mrs. Bailey was made up
                                 out of a New York story, which she told Mrs. Bailey and Jerusha
                                 Vroman the first day she came there. So we are told.</p>
                              <p>"We have never heard any stories against Benjamin Bailey, except
                                 that we have just heard that Mrs. Bailey and Jerusha Vroman speak
                                 unfavorably of him, but do not state anything in particular.</p>

                  <p>Deacon Sommers was not as well satisfied with the result of all their
                     inquiries, after having received the Hartley letter, as he had hoped to be; but
                     it was thought best to have Laura let the matter rest.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Judge Bailey got a hint of what Mrs. Cummings had written in their favor,
                     and Mrs. Smoothwell told Mrs. Bailey that Mr. Smoothwell had written a very
                     complimentary letter for them to a gentleman by the name of William Sommers,
                     living at Niagara Falls. On hearing these things David Bailey took it into his
                     head without consulting his father, to write a letter to Laura. Consequently
                     Miss Sommers was one day favored by receiving the following letter:</p>

                              <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Dear Madam—Among the varied and numerous incidents
                                 of life, there is one subject of daily occurrence, and I may say,
                                 as it were, of vast and thrilling importance which is presented,
                                 and I may say as it were, daily presented for our consideration, or
                                 rather for the consideration as it were, of both sexes. That
                                 subject is the subject of matrimony, and after considerable
                                 reflection and experience I have come to the determination to offer
                                 my hand and heart to some lady whom I can respect, and if you are
                                 willing to accept the position, I shall be happy to be informed of
                                 your wishes as soon as you can determine on so important a step. It
                                 is presumed by me that from your prompt manner of action and your
                                 decision of character, as well as from your knowledge as it were of
                                 circumstances, that you will be able to decide this proposal within
                                 thirty days from date, as I have agreed within that time to give an
                                 answer to another lady.</p>
                              <p>"Very respectfully,</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>This letter Laura never answered. It destroyed what little respect she had ever
                     entertained for David Bailey. She pronounced it the work of an empty-headed
                     dandy, whose education had done him no good. She considered the letter a
                     ludicrous curiosity; but thought when taken in connection with Mrs. Hartley's
                     letter, that it showed at least a motive for what had been said against
                     Benjamin by Judge Bailey's family.</p>
                  <p>Laura immediately wrote to Mrs. Judge Bailey, asking for the name of the young
                     lady whom they claimed had been so shamefully treated by Benjamin Bailey, and
                     to be referred to any others who knew anything against him. Laura also wrote
                     that a direct and plain answer was important.</p>
                  <p>It is probable that Judge Bailey concluded that this inquiry had something to
                     do with the consideration of David's letter. He, therefore, directed Mrs.
                     Bailey to refer Laura and her mother to Miss Jerusha Vroman. Jerusha also wrote
                     a short note, stating that she, herself, was the person whom Benjamin had
                     treated as Mrs. Bailey had informed them, but she did not think it necessary to
                     state particulars. This note was inclosed with Mrs. Bailey's letter and sent to
                     Laura.</p>
                  <p>When Laura received the answer she thought it strange that no reference could
                     be given except to the very person whom Mrs. Hartley's letter had already cast
                     a suspicion against. Deacon Sommers thought the same, and suggested that it
                     tended to show that Mrs. Hartley's letter might all be true.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding David had received no reply to his letter, he made a visit to
                     Deacon Sommers within the "thirty days," where he made even a worse impression
                     on Deacon Sommers than he had previously made on the mind of Laura. His
                     attempts to make matters plain<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6367-00000063"/>
                     against Benjamin Bailey were so closely inquired into that he lost his courage,
                     and that confused his memory so that he could not keep his equivocations and
                     misstatements consistent with each other, nor with known facts.</p>
                  <p>It was quite agreeable to all Deacon Sommers' family when he abruptly closed
                     his visit under the impression that he was not destined to be the husband of
                     Laura Sommers.</p>
                  <p>Judge Bailey and his family began to fear the danger that <emph>in time wrong
                        o'erloads itself!</emph>

                  <p>"ALL aboard!" sounded the accustomed voice of the railroad conductor at
                     Fallington station—and then the passengers, who had alighted for refreshments,
                     and who had, probably nearly all, secured their right change for their
                     half-devoured lunch, were hurrying back to retake their places in the cars, and
                     with the usual caution of travelers, to see if coats, shawls, parcels,
                     bandboxes and other hand-luggage, were still in possession of
                        <emph>themselves</emph> and the <emph>seats</emph> whereon they had been
                     left to do the duty of dumb policemen!</p>
                  <p>There was also the usual supply of additional passengers, among whom, a young
                     man, a little below the average height, slim in proportion, and dressed in a
                     suit of drab, entered the rear car. His personal appearance was tidy and
                     prepossessing; his hair a light brown, and he wore side whiskers, which were of
                     a sandy color; his complexion was remarkably fair for that of a gentleman; his
                     bearing was easy and agreeable, but he had the appearance of being two or three
                     years younger than he really was. He had said his adieus to his friends, who
                     had accompanied him to the depot, and, as the train started<pb n="126-127"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000064"/> he seated himself by an open car-window where
                     the last parting words which he caught, were in the voice of his anxious
                     mother: "Mercy on me, Benjamin," said she, "be careful of yourself; and, don't
                     let any accident happen to you while you are gone; and write to us every day
                     that you can." To which Benjamin replied, "God bless you, mother; and all of
                     you." And as the train bore him away, they saw a handkerchief waved from that
                     car-window bidding them his silent adieu.</p>
                  <p>Young Bailey's thoughts were too much occupied at first, with other matters, to
                     be diverted by the strangers in a railroad car, or by anticipating the
                     pleasures of travel. He had received a letter of general instructions from his
                     friend, Mr. Baldwin, and was required to report on the first of August to
                     Collector A. of the Niagara District, for special instructions. He had
                     calculated, however, to visit for a short time the points of interest about the
                     great falls, before commencing duty as an officer. Never having visited Niagara
                     Falls, he had preferred not to see the Collector of Customs till he should be
                     at least a little acquainted with some of the localities in a vicinity so
                     noted.</p>
                  <p>And somehow his thoughts would revert to Laura Sommers and her home in that
                     locality, to which he was approaching, and where he was to become
                     acquainted—and perhaps under circumstances which would add romance to the
                     acquaintance that he had once begun with Laura. He could not help thinking how
                     pleasant it would be to visit Laura and her friends had not cruel fate allowed
                     him to be misrepresented, and separated them from him. One moment he thought he
                     would go and see Mr. Sommers and insist on offering some proof of his innocence
                     of any dishonorable course, and offer references to persons of standing in
                     Fallington; and the next moment pride, delicacy, and the thought of the
                     reception he might receive, discouraged him.</p>
                  <p>If Benjamin tried to think whether he had any friends and acquaintances
                     residing at Niagara Falls who could post him up and show him about, it was not
                     an unnatural thought; and there is many a weary house-keeper residing at the
                     Falls whose patience has concluded that such ideas are not
                        <emph>unusual,</emph> even among the most
                        distant—<emph>acquaintances!</emph> "It is wonderful how popular it makes
                     one with all their old acquaintances—with all their <emph>new</emph>
                     acquaintances—with father's old neighbors and with the acquaintances of your
                     wife's second and third cousins, whenever they come from distant parts to visit
                     the Falls! come to see you a couple of months in such a delightful place—come
                     to make you a good, long visit—I declare! said they, before leaving home, it is
                     too warm weather to keep house! Too warm for them to keep house? Did they think
                     of others?"</p>
                  <p>Of course this little satire doesn't mean everybody, for there are, no doubt,
                     many sensible people who don't even visit their friends enough at Niagara
                     Falls, because, either nervously or humorously such reflections have been
                     suggested.</p>
                  <p>I am certain, however, that Benjamin Bailey would not have thought of hunting
                     up a fifteenth cousin whom he had never seen before with the sole intention of
                        spending<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6367-00000065"/> the summer months under
                     their hospitable roof—"to see the falls."</p>
                  <p>But as the train speeds along towards Laura Sommers' home, nobody that has ever
                     been in love will blame Ben Bailey for wishing it were so that he could make a
                     visit at Deacon Sommers'. But he does not feel permitted to do so. He thinks,
                     however, that possibly he may gain a favorable acquaintance with some friend of
                     theirs who may sometime favor him so far as to induce Mr. Sommers to furnish
                     him with the secret facts about the slander, that he may be able to vindicate
                     his honor; though he presumes that Laura has long ago ceased to think of
                     him!</p>
                  <p>When the train reached the city of Rochester our new detective felt a strange
                     interest in the words of the conductor as he called out to the passengers:
                     "Rochester! Passengers for the Niagara Falls road change cars!"</p>
                  <p>The train stopped; and then followed the usual rush and the usual variety of
                     passengers—home-folks and foreign visitors, bound for the Falls—citizens of the
                     frontier villages, of Niagara Falls, Niagara City and Lewiston, and
                     way-passengers on their private business, and travelers for the great West via
                     Suspension Bridge, and at this time an additional variety of characters
                     occasioned by the war of the great rebellion; some of whose missions were as
                     secret as that of Benjamin Bailey's.</p>
                  <p>Our new detective entered the Niagara Falls car in time to secure a seat by
                     himself; but as the crowd came into the car they began to claim their right to
                     a seat by the side of those who occupied the room intended for two persons.
                     Some, who had previously taken possession of a whole seat designed for two
                     persons, placed their traveling bags with themselves in the seat to give the
                     appearance that the whole room in their seats was claimed. And various were the
                     tricks of old travelers for securing the most room exclusively to
                     themselves.</p>
                  <p>Two elderly gentlemen entered the front door of the car in which toward the
                     rear, Benjamin was seated. They appeared to be well acquainted with each other,
                     and looking for a seat together. Just before reaching Benjamin Bailey they
                     politely asked a gentleman, occupying a seat alone, where two could be seated,
                     if he would oblige them so much as to take a seat with that gentleman—pointing
                     to the vacant seat by the side of Bailey—so they two could sit together, as
                     they wanted to chat a little.</p>
                  <p>The man thus accosted, replied that he presumed the two gentlemen could find
                     seats enough in the forward cars! The <emph>manner,</emph> however, in which
                     this individual "presumed" what he evidently knew nothing about, was in keeping
                     with the probability, from the number of passengers, that he believed no such
                     "presumption!"</p>
                  <p>The two gentlemen made no reply to this indirect refusal; nor had they hardly
                     time to have done so ere Benjamin Bailey politely offered and vacated his seat
                     for their accommodation. They thanked him and accepted his offer; while he took
                     a seat with another gentleman near them.</p>
                  <p>The older one of the two gentlemen remarked to Bailey, that "he hoped it might
                     happen in his way sometime to do him a favor in return."</p>
                  <p>"Gentlemen," said Bailey, "it seems to me that so<pb n="130-131"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000066"/> small a favor is only a common civility; and
                     your polite acknowledgment already leaves no balance in my favor."</p>
                  <p>"Well, at any rate," pleasantly replied the same elderly gentleman, "I think
                     you are deserving of our good will, and I don't very often make mistakes in my
                     first impressions of people."</p>
                  <p>"Thank you for the compliment," returned Bailey, with a very perceptible blush,
                     and a manner altogether such as pleased the two unknown gentlemen, and called
                     out a remark from the one who had not spoken, "What a difference," said he in
                     an undertone to the other, "there <emph>is</emph> in people!"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, indeed," responded the other, "and it only takes a trifle besides a man's
                     countenance to make us read his whole character!"</p>
                  <p>Benjamin Bailey had now turned to his newspaper. And now let us inquire, who is
                     that elderly gentleman, who, as well as his friend, has formed so good an
                     opinion of Mr. Benjamin Bailey as a stranger? Ah! that is a secret which
                     Benjamin little dreamed of at that time, or he would not so soon have forgotten
                     the compliment just paid him—not even to read of the prospect of a fight
                     between General Sherman and the rebel General Hood at Atlanta. No, no; for that
                     elderly gentleman is Deacon Sommers of Niagara Falls! The other is the
                     Collector of Customs of the Niagara District.</p>
                  <p>But as Mr. Sommers and the Collector entered into conversation together, and
                     other matters attracted Bailey's attention, the link of conversation was broken
                     off, and was not renewed; which, otherwise might have led to a very
                     embarrassing recognition of names between Mr. William Sommers and Mr. Benjamin
                     Bailey; in which case, it would probably have been a perplexing puzzle for
                     Deacon Sommers to have reconciled his "first impressions" of the stranger on
                     this occasion, with the opinions <emph>he had formed through another
                        source;</emph> and, had supposed himself still to have of one Benjamin
                     Bailey residing near the village of Fallington!</p>
                  <p>With the thoughts which must have been brought up, under all the circumstances,
                     and in the presence too, of the Collector, to whom Benjamin was soon to report
                     for duty as an officer of customs, the occasion was not a desirable one for
                     recognition! and much less for an explanation! It was better, therefore, to
                     happen as it did; though it was a long time afterwards before Deacon Sommers
                     knew that he had ever seen Benjamin Bailey; and, that, without knowing it, he
                     had formed as favorable an opinion of him as had Mrs. Sommers when she and her
                     daughter first saw him during their visit at Fallington a little less than one
                     year previous to this time!</p>
                  <p>As we have intimated elsewhere, Benjamin Bailey had traveled but very little;
                     hence, the strategic movements by a gentleman and lady to secure plenty of room
                     in the car for themselves, had attracted Benjamin's attention, when he first
                     took his seat, before the train had started. And he soon had opportunity to
                     notice the success of their strategem, as he now sat in the next seat behind
                     them.</p>
                  <p>They had entered the car in time to find two car-seats together, unoccupied;
                     they laid a satchel and some articles<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6367-00000067"
                     /> cles of over-clothing in the empty seat in front of the one which they
                     personally took possession of. This gave the seat before them, which they had
                     turned to face from them, the <emph>appearance of having been claimed by some
                        party who had stepped away for a moment!</emph> and, as the gentleman behind
                     it seemed to manifest no interest in the matter, no one of course ventured any
                     inquiries; passengers in search of a seat, and even the conductor, of course
                     supposing that <emph>that</emph> seat was "occupied!"</p>
                  <p>But now the train was under good headway, and all, in that car at least, had
                     become seated, by crowding in, two and two. The plan has succeeded. The jolly
                     couple in front of our new detective, now turn over the mysterious seat in
                     question, to their own advantage; the gentleman at the same time remarking to
                     the lady that "every trade has its tricks and this is one of the tricks of
                     travel!"</p>
                  <p>"Possibly," responded the lady, "by the time we arrive at the next station the
                     conductor may compel us to make another 'move,' and we shall lose this fine
                     advantage!"</p>
                  <p>"Very true, they may come and put a verbal 'attachment' on our extra 'room' and
                     drive us into closer 'quarters,' unless I claim to be a Major General, and thus
                     make it out a 'military necessity!' that we keep the advantage."</p>
                  <p>"I'm afraid that wouldn't work," replied the little woman. "You don't look
                     Major Generalish enough!"</p>
                  <p>"Then I would try another point of argument—I would claim it by 'right of
                     possession,' and put on the assumption of a lawyer. Wouldn't I look like a
                     lawyer?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, <emph>appear</emph> like one—in a bad cause!"</p>
                  <p>"Then I would tell him to commence his suits, and I would beat him on 'time;'
                     and try <emph>that</emph> argument to make him let us alone!"</p>
                  <p>"But," retorted the little lady, with a roguish smile, "suppose the conductor
                     and his brakemen should use a more forcible argument than your quibbles?"</p>
                  <p>"Then I'd tell him—as the South tells Abraham Lincoln—that 'it is
                     unconstitutional to use force,' and that all I ask of him or his brakemen, is,
                     'to let us alone!'"</p>
                  <p>"What if they should take <emph>both</emph> seats away from us, then, and put
                     us off the cars into the bargain?"</p>
                  <p>"If they tried that, I would scare the brakemen off by reminding them that
                     these are war times, and that the President has suspended the writ of habeas
                     corpus! They would'nt know what it means, but that is the way politicians
                     frighten voters now, you know."</p>
                  <p>"Don't mention politics—I hate both parties."</p>
                  <p>"How so?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, because they tell such miserable falsehoods, and talk such intricate
                     nonsense, and then have to fight about it!"</p>
                  <p>"Would you rather talk about the <emph>fashions?</emph>" retorted the
                     gentleman, in a joking manner.</p>
                  <p>"O, yes! certainly; a magnificent change of subject—presto, of course; for they
                     do say there are such delightful styles out this month!"</p>
                  <p>"I presume so," was the reply; "silk dresses that trail a half-yard on the
                     dusty sidewalk, without the slightest regard to good sense or neatness."</p>
                  <pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6367-00000068"/>
                  <p>"Yes, a full half-yard!" interrupted the lady, without noticing the last part
                     of his remark. "Such long dresses give immense grace to one's figure! and, by
                     the way," said the sociable Mrs. Smith, (if that was her name,) "that reminds
                     me that we are going where silk is very cheap—unless the Canadians want too
                     many 'greenbacks' for a dollar—too much of our money for too little of
                     theirs!"</p>
                  <p>"Hush! remember the customs officers are more strict than they used to be when
                     you crossed the Suspension Bridge before!"</p>
                  <p>That means smuggling! thought Benjamin Bailey. And as he took notice that he
                     might identify them, his eye fell on a name on their traveling bags, lying on
                     the seat in front of them. Of the name and such other matters as he thought
                     best, he made a note in his diary.</p>
                  <p>It was one of the peculiar qualifications of Ben Bailey that he had acquired
                     the art of writing short-hand, and he was in the habit of keeping a very full
                     journal in that way. By this practice he had become able to write with much
                     rapidity, and to this we are indebted for many particulars of incidents which
                     are related in this volume.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The two Detectives—A Laughable and Mutual Deception—Benjamin
                     learns something of Niagara Falls and Smugglers.</head>
                  <p>WHEN the train reached Brockport Bailey took his traveling bag and went into
                     the next car, where he seated himself by the side of a man whom he found very
                     talkative, and who said he had lately moved from Niagara Falls. Bailey asked
                     him a great many questions in relation to that locality, and about business
                     there, and he wondered if it was not easy to smuggle across the Niagara River
                     in some places.</p>
                  <p>At this moment the conductor was making change with a man seated just before
                     them, and as he turned to look at Bailey's ticket he remarked to Bailey that "a
                     man is not very smart if he cannot smuggle without being caught at it."</p>
                  <p>Not long after the conductor had made this remark, a shrewd-looking man came in
                     from another car and took a seat just behind Bailey. And though at first he
                     only seemed interested in his newspaper, he gradually managed to get into
                     conversation with Bailey, and the opportunity became a good one as the stranger
                     in the seat with Bailey got off the train at the next station. The man with the
                     newspaper grew more and more sociable, and no two<pb n="136-137"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000069"/> smugglers could have sooner or more easily
                     worked their way to the question of smuggling than did these two strangers,
                     Bedan and Bailey.</p>
                  <p>Now, the fact was, this man who was courting Ben Bailey's attention, was an old
                     officer of customs, and well known as such to all the railroad conductors whose
                     trains ran to Niagara Falls. For three years back he had been constantly
                     traveling as a detective, and frequently on this road. The conductor at this
                     time having heard Bailey speak of smuggling, fancied it would be well to put
                     this detective on his track, as he happened to be on board the train.</p>
                  <p>Knowing the circumstances it does not now seem very remarkable that the new
                     detective, Ben Bailey, and the stranger with the newspaper, found themselves so
                     easily drawn into conversation in which each one was trying to learn what he
                     could of the other. Without a knowledge of these circumstances it certainly
                     would have seemed singular to have noticed what a propensity these two
                     passengers so soon had for asking questions of each other, and how willingly
                     each was to learn any facts on the subject of smuggling.</p>
                  <p>When the old detective—for a blind—turned the subject upon the weather, or the
                     crops, or the railroads, he noticed that the young man shortly returned to the
                     questions about the Niagara River; the custom house; the cost of articles in
                     Canada; the duties and the inducements for smuggling; from which he concluded
                     that the young man had either the most extraordinary curiosity in the direction
                     of custom houses and smuggling, or else he was one of the most verdant,
                     yellow-haired Yankees that ever contemplated his first speculations in that
                     line of business. Bailey, on his part, had formed the decided opinion that this
                     fellow-traveler hated the government, the taxes, and custom house officials in
                     particular; and that he was, probably, an old smuggler.</p>
                  <p>Their conversation, up to this stage of conclusions, had been designed on both
                     sides "to call each other out." At first it was common-place talk, then a
                     little skirmishing, to find out each other's business and each other's views on
                     free trade and smuggling.</p>
                  <p>The following is a portion of what was said, neither party for one moment
                     suspecting that the other was a detective:</p>
                  <p>"I have lately heard considerable about smuggling," said Bailey. "They say they
                     watch smugglers pretty closely. How many officers have they right about the
                     Falls?"</p>
                  <p>"Not so many that one need be afraid of them," was the reply of Bedan.</p>
                  <p>"I suppose when strangers wish to speculate that way, they generally hire some
                     persons living on the frontier, who are acquainted with the business, to get
                     the goods across the river, don't they?" inquired Bailey.</p>
                  <p>"Frequently, but it is easy done by anybody, one way or another."</p>
                  <p>"Is it true that a great many get rich just by getting goods from Canada into
                     the States without paying duty on them? or is it," said Bailey, "more dangerous
                     than profitable?"</p>
                  <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6367-00000070"/>
                  <p>"Profitable! I'll be hanged if it isn't," said Bedan. "There is one man, in
                     particular, who lives in Tonawanda, half-way between the Falls and Buffalo, who
                     has made a fortune at it! principally by smuggling whisky; and made it all in
                     about a year back!"</p>
                  <p>"How do they manage to avoid detection?" inquired Bailey.</p>
                  <p>"O! that's a secret which belongs to the business. Perhaps I could tell you
                     more about that than it would be for my interest to tell!" was Bedan's
                     reply.</p>
                  <p>"What can you have to fear from me?" replied Bailey, feeling quite elated with
                     the idea of getting acquainted with a real smuggler. "I am," said Bailey, "an
                     entire stranger on the frontier, and don't know one of the officers there; and
                     besides that, if you are in the secret, and can convince me you have been smart
                     enough to make money out of it yourself, I am willing to pay you for posting me
                     up."</p>
                  <p>"Well, what do you want?" asked the old detective, for he began now to suspect
                     Bailey knew more of the frontier than he pretended, and also flattered himself
                     he had well-nigh won Bailey's confidence as a smuggler himself.</p>
                  <p>"Well, for instance," replied Bailey, "how could you assist me, suppose I
                     should buy a few barrels of whisky on the Canada side? Have you any means of
                     getting it across the river?"</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps I have," was Bedan's reply.</p>
                  <p>"I suppose the <emph>perhaps,</emph>" said Bailey, "means, provided I paid you
                     enough for running the risk."</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps it does!" returned the old detective, pretending a little caution,
                     "and perhaps it means we don't help any stranger into the business till he
                     begins the business first, himself. This is the rule, and I know they wouldn't
                     post me up till after they knew I had smuggled something myself, as a sort of
                     confidence initiation. But for all I know to the contrary, you may be better
                     posted on smuggling than I am," said the old detective, with a kind of
                     suspicious laugh.</p>
                  <p>"O! no, upon my word," said Bailey, "I was never at Niagara Falls in my
                     life."</p>
                  <p>"Since we have talked so much, then," replied the old detective, taking out his
                     tobacco-box and filling his mouth with a huge quid of tobacco, as if he were
                     thinking of something else, instead of the voracious quantity—"since I've told
                     you my views on free trade"—he resumed, as soon as his tongue had rolled the
                     "fine cut" a little out of the way of his organs of <emph>speech,</emph> "I
                     should like to have you regard what I have said as a private matter; and
                     if—"</p>
                  <p>Here, happening to remember the etiquette of tobacco-users, he extended the
                     remnant of a paper of tobacco, with the polite invitation:</p>
                  <p>"Here, stranger, beg your pardon, take a chew?"</p>
                  <p>"No, thank you, you will have to excuse me."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! don't use the weed, eh? but as I was going to say, if you will tell me
                     candidly whether you thought of dealing in whisky, or anything in which you
                     would need a boat, I can tell you who are the best and most cautious<pb
                        n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6367-00000071"/> tious men for you on the frontier
                     between Buffalo and Youngstown."</p>
                  <p>"I thought, sir, of getting acquainted with the business first."</p>
                  <p>"Hang it!" thought Bedan, "this is a queer fellow. He is bold as a fool before
                     he begins the business; or else he's playing a game of curiosity for his own
                     amusement. I can't make his intention nor his business correspond with my
                     impressions of the fellow, I can't; I'll be hanged if I can!" thought Bedan,
                     instead of making an immediate reply to Bailey's <unclear/> remark.</p>
                  <p>After a moment Bailey inquired: "Are you interested in any boats doing that
                     kind of work? if you are, I shall be pleased to see you and your friends after
                     I have visited the Falls a few days."</p>
                  <p>"Hang it!" thought Bedan, "he <emph>means</emph> to smuggle, whether he ever
                        <emph>has</emph> or not!" so the old detective replied: "Well, as your talk
                     seems to mean our kind of business, I would say, I have a few very fine, fast
                     boats, and I shall be happy to do you all the favors I can
                        <emph>consistently!</emph> But until you shall be admitted into the
                     organization of 'free traders,' you and I must keep each other's secrets from
                     other smugglers! For instance, in connection with smuggling you are not to
                     mention my name, nor I yours."</p>
                  <p>"Precisely so; a thing we shall not be very apt to do till those convenient
                     titles of our individualities become known between ourselves!" said Bailey,
                     with a suppressed laugh.</p>
                  <p>"Ha, ha! very true; my name is Bedan, George Bedan."</p>
                  <p>"And mine is Bailey. But I was going to ask, how you manage to evade the
                     officers?"</p>
                  <p>"That's the very secret—that's the trade. It's like medicine for the asthma;
                     one medicine don't suit every case; you have to change it according to
                     symptoms."</p>
                  <p>Bedan could account for his own boldness of conversation about smuggling,
                     because he was no smuggler, except he did so for a blind to detect others, but
                     when he saw Bailey's want of caution about his probable intention to smuggle,
                     he concluded he must be one of those unaccountable Yankees, we sometimes meet
                     with, in search of adventure and speculation. And he anticipated easily
                     catching him in his attempts at smuggling.</p>
                  <p>To Bailey's inquiry as to the best hotels about the Falls to stop at, Bedan
                     replied:</p>
                  <p>"If you wish to pass as a gentleman of travel, above the suspicion of
                     smuggling, you must take up your headquarters at the very best houses. And if
                     it is your intention to bring rich dress goods across from Canada, such as silk
                     and silk velvet, etc., or jewelry, and such like, it is a pity you have not
                     provided yourself with a lady assistant. But perhaps you have done so?"
                     inquiringly added the old detective.</p>
                  <p>"No, I have no lady with me."</p>
                  <p>"Well, we can arrange that; what you can't find along Niagara, you can't
                     anywhere. With the present style of ladies' dress, you can easily understand
                     how they can conceal and bring over three or four hundred dollars' worth of
                     goods at once, right before the eyes of the officers, and all the while appear
                     as innocent as little<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6367-00000072"/> lambs. Of
                     course, the gentleman accompanies the lady, and crosses the Suspension Bridge,
                     either on the cars or in a carriage procured of one of the most innocent
                     drivers in the world! who will report for you 'nothing aboard,' with the
                     intention, if the carriage is seized, of swearing that he could not of course
                     have known that the lady had concealed goods aboard. You see I'm posted, and if
                     you want any help I'm on hand."</p>
                  <p>"By George!" said Bailey, "you do seem to understand it. Do you keep any
                     carriages for that purpose?"</p>
                  <p>"No, but I can tell you whose carriages have never been caught yet! If you have
                     got the capital to carry on the business I can give you plans enough. But we
                     fellows who understand the frontier, and all the 'tricks of trade' there,
                     expect a liberal percentage for our aid in such matters whenever you
                     succeed."</p>
                  <p>"O, certainly," said Bailey, "if I find you are the right man, and if I
                     conclude to risk your plans after seeing how you manage the matter a little, I
                     can raise some funds, but I might not meet your expectations, for I am only a
                     country-bred chap, any how; and like the poorer class of editors, we don't deal
                     much in luxuries; probably in other respects we don't resemble editors. Farmers
                     generally have to work hard, you know, and don't grow rich fast, and besides
                     that, they don't handle large amounts continually, like merchants, and bankers,
                     and speculators; and I've no doubt it is this difference which cultivates
                     different ideas of liberality, and greater or less caution as to using or
                     investing money. So you must bear with me a little till I become accustomed
                     tomed to your views of liberality and right, and to your customs
                     generally!"</p>
                  <p>"Our customs! you know we don't believe in <emph>customs,</emph>" said
                     Bedan.</p>
                  <p>"No, not in <emph>custom-house</emph> customs, of course, but in, at least, the
                     custom of avoiding customs!" was Bailey's laughing reply.</p>
                  <p>"Ah! precisely so! I am acquainted with some customary ways, as well as some
                     very <emph>un</emph>-customary ways in that line; else, of course, I should be
                     a very poor pilot for 'free traders' to employ to aid in getting their goods
                     across the Niagara into a port of safety!"</p>
                  <p>"A port of safety!" thought Bedan; "perhaps it is mean for me to deceive the
                     fellow; but if men will break the laws they must <emph>expect</emph> a
                     detective will trap them if he can, and bring them to punishment." Such were
                     Bedan's secret reflections; while Bailey at the same time rested for a moment
                     on the last remark of the "smuggler's pilot!" and privately thought,—"All
                     right! I've been lucky enough already to stumble on the right man to let me
                     into the smugglers' secrets, and into their very camp, I suppose, if I choose
                     to go there. But it's thundering queer," thought Ben Bailey, "that smugglers
                     are so bold in their talk; especially to a stranger like me—though perhaps
                     that's the secret! he takes me for a country fellow, with a little money on a
                     speculating trip, ready for a little smuggling, and being in the business
                     himself he can make a little something on what he helps me to smuggle. I don't
                     know what kind of officers they have in the custom-house service, but this old
                     smuggler, or<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6367-00000073"/> chief aid in some
                     branch of their business, evidently don't honor <emph>me</emph> with the
                     suspicion that I could possibly be such an officer! Well, if I lack anything in
                     appearance, and it turns to my advantage, so more it be," thought Ben.</p>
                  <p>The old detective and the new occupied the time in conversation on smuggling
                     and other subjects, if we deduct an occasional pause, till they reached the
                     Falls; before which time, however, it had been arranged that Bailey should drop
                     a letter in the Niagara Falls post-office to let Bedan know where and when he
                     could meet him, and to do this so soon as Bailey should be ready for</p>

                  <p>IN due time the train stopped at the village of Niagara Falls, and our two
                     detectives, Bailey and Bedan, who had deceived themselves, as badly as each had
                     deceived the other, separated in the crowd of passengers.</p>
                  <p>Bailey concluded to leave his trunk in the railroad baggage-room, and sometime
                     during the day to return for it. Of course an experienced traveler would have
                     had himself and his baggage taken directly to a first class hotel; but Benjamin
                     Bailey took a notion to spend a little time looking about the place, and to
                     decide from his own observation as to where he would select a boarding place.
                     He first went forward to the baggage-car, and had his trunk placed safely in
                     care of the baggage-man, to whom he paid a liberal fee. He then passed by the
                     first group of porters and hotel runners in the most perfect safety;
                     notwithstanding the greatly exaggerated and fearful accounts given of this
                     whole class at the Falls by an occasional newspaper correspondent, who in some
                     instances may have left the hotels angry at not being able to offset his
                     board-bill against what his pen would or would not say in the newspapers, he
                     claiming to be a highly-salaried<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6367-00000074"/>
                     salaried correspondent, though writing under an assumed name in consequence,
                     (as he has previously intimated to the landlord,) of his great modesty!</p>
                  <p>Had the porters and runners been as bad as sometimes represented, the
                     regulations at the depot, at this place, are so excellent, and so strictly
                     enforced by police officers and railroad employees, that passengers as they get
                     off the cars, have ample room and opportunity to look after their own baggage,
                     or walk into large and commodious sitting-rooms of the depot without being
                     confronted, or troubled with questions or solicitations.</p>
                  <p>Those who drive an omnibus for any hotel, occupy a small space at a proper
                     distance, and passengers may converse with these porters by approaching them,
                     or pass directly to and through the sitting-rooms of the depot. As they leave
                     the depot they will usually, during the summer season, find from ten to twenty
                     elegant carriages waiting along the platform at the west side of the depot,
                     which is about eighty rods from the great cataract. Carriages are also found
                     waiting at various points close in view of the falls and rapids.</p>
                  <p>Bailey emerged from the passengers' sitting-room, and was immediately upon the
                     side-walk at the corner of the streets. The sharp eye of a hackman in an
                     instant detected him as a stranger, from the manner in which he looked about to
                     view whatever the streets at this point, in four directions, allowed him to see
                     of the celebrated little village of Niagara Falls.</p>
                  <p>Writing these pages as I am upon the banks of Niagara, and having a familiar
                     acquaintance with doings in this locality, I can assure the reader that very
                     many of those engaged in the hack business at Niagara Falls, are reliable,
                     intelligent, and respectable, business men; many of them driving their own
                     carriages for their passengers.</p>
                  <p>As in every other business, there is occasionally a peculiar character among
                     the hack-drivers at Niagara, and such was Mr. Gulliver's driver.</p>
                  <p>"Do you wish to hire a carriage, sir?" said Mr. Gulliver's driver, in his most
                     beseeching manner to our new detective.</p>
                  <p>"No, sir, not at present. But may I inquire how far it is to the Niagara
                     Falls?"</p>
                  <p>"O, only a <emph>short</emph> distance, sir; I am going right there; get
                     aboard, sir; take you there for twenty-five cents."</p>
                  <p>By this time the driver had stopped the carriage close by Bailey, and he
                     accepted the very reasonable offer of the driver and got into the carriage,
                     without the least idea whether a "short distance" means a quarter of a mile or
                     two miles and a quarter. But how can he refuse his patronage when only such a
                     trifling sum as twenty-five cents is asked by a driver who has so evidently
                     intended the offer as a favor, seeing he was "going right that way" with his
                     carriage!</p>
                  <p>"How far did you say it is to the falls?"</p>
                  <p>"Only a '<emph>short distance,</emph>' sir," repeated the driver, as he cracked
                     his whip and turned his horses down Falls street, intending to take his
                     passenger in view of Goat Island, and drive along Mechanic street in view of
                     the rapids and towards the Ferry House, on which route a large portion of the
                     falls can be seen from carriages.</p>
                  <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6367-00000075"/>
                  <p>"There's a good many places about here that strangers go to see, and to get
                     different views of the falls. People might think before they come here that all
                     there is to do, to see Niagara Falls, is just to come here an' stand an' look
                     at 'em—from almost anywhere in sight of 'em; but everybody finds when they get
                     here that these 'ere falls is a mighty big thing afore you get all 'round 'em.
                     Anybody needs a whole day, with a carriage, to see all the points of
                     interest."</p>
                  <p>"I should not suppose it would take a long time to see the falls after you get
                     to them," said Bailey.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, but it's a dum sight worse than just walkin' around a big hay-stack!"</p>
                  <p>"I presume so," said Bailey, smiling at the driver's odd comparison.</p>
                  <p>"That's the International Hotel on the corner here," said the driver; "and the
                     other big, rough-cast structure right by the rapids here, is the Cataract
                     House—both good houses, tip-top fare and everything."</p>
                  <p>"Good many visitors stopping there?" inquired Bailey.</p>
                  <p>"Not a great many just now. Probably about five hundred at each house."</p>
                  <p>"Say, driver, did you say you were going right to the falls?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir, there's the rapids, right there. Don't you see how the river dances
                     about on a regular rough-and-tumble?"</p>
                  <p>Bailey acknowledged that he did; and here the driver turned down the short
                     street between the two large hotels, and in a moment more stopped his carriage
                     near Goat Island bridge, which crosses the rapids just above the American
                     fall.</p>
                  <p>"There," said the driver, "just below us you see where the water pitches over;
                     but the big part of the fall—the Horse-shoe fall—is over beyond Goat Island, on
                     the Canada side. There's seventy-five acres in that island right at the brink
                     of the falls there. But you see, stranger, that the falls are a dum sight the
                     biggest!"</p>
                  <p>"But we can't get a good view of the falls here, driver," said Bailey, starting
                     to get out of the carriage.</p>
                  <p>"Of course you can't get a <emph>good</emph> view of the falls if you get out
                     here. But I can drive to a place where you can get a better view. <emph>You'd
                        like a better view, wouldn't you?</emph>"</p>
                  <p>Bailey thought the driver a very <emph>clever</emph> fellow—very
                        <emph>sociable</emph>—so he resumed his seat, and the driver resumed his
                     business, which was to keep his passenger interested in hopes he would extend
                     his patronage to a longer ride. The driver started up his team and in a few
                     moments he called the attention of his passenger to a partial view of the falls
                     upon the Canadian side of the river.</p>
                  <p>"Magnificent! sublime!" exclaimed Bailey.</p>
                  <p>"Do you see," asked the driver, "that fine, large, yellow building on the
                     opposite side of the river, with double piazzas extend—"</p>
                  <p>"Never mind your large buildings and piazzas," said Bailey, continuing his
                     intense gaze towards the Horseshoe fall. "Hadn't I better get out here, so I
                     can walk round somewhere and get a better view?"</p>
                  <p>"Would you like to go where you can get a <emph>front</emph> view<pb
                        n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6367-00000076"/> of the falls?" asked the driver,
                     while his horses kept on a slow trot.</p>
                  <p>"Why, yes, I would."</p>
                  <p>"Well, that is what I was going to tell you; you see that yellow establishment,
                     large building, double piazzas extending around two sides?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes."</p>
                  <p>"Well, that's the Clifton House—that's where Jenny Lind stopped several weeks
                     when she nightingaled it so in this country. In fact it's where the Prince of
                     Wales stopped, and where every noted person makes a stop before leaving the
                     Falls. You see it was built there because there is the best view—a 'front view'
                     of the whole Falls, on both sides of the river; and it's kept in the very best,
                     tip-topest style. They take greenback money, and only charge the same as the
                     best houses this side. It's across there you must go to get the best view—a
                     front view!"</p>
                  <p>"How far, driver, do you have to go to get there?'</p>
                  <p>"O, not a '<emph>great</emph>' ways—just around by the railroad Suspension
                     Bridge."</p>
                  <p>"How far off is that bridge? I always thought it was close by Niagara
                     Falls."</p>
                  <p>"No, but it's just '<emph>below</emph>' here—only a '<emph>little ways.</emph>'
                     There's the Whirlpool, too, a mile below the bridge, which everybody goes to
                     see. You can go to it upon either side of the river. And there's Buttery's
                     Rapids, which strangers go down to see, just below the bridge, by a sawmill
                     which runs by a curious contrivance of long, wire ropes, two hundred and fifty
                     feet off—down the bank— in the rapids! And then a mile further down the river,
                     there's the Devil's Hole, a queer place in the river bank, with a spring in a
                     cave; and there was an Indian massacre there once. Then just beyond the Canada
                     falls is the battle-ground of Lundy's Lane, and near that a curious burning
                     spring. And so I could tell of points of interest all around this vicinity for
                     a whole day's drive. If you would like to go and see some of the best places,
                     as far as you have time to-day, I'd be glad to take you as cheap as anybody
                     will!"</p>
                  <p>"Say, driver, where are you taking me to?" inquired Benjamin. "It seems to me
                     you have got almost a mile away from the falls!"</p>
                  <p>"Why, of course," replied the sociable driver, "you are not bound to ride any
                     further than you wish to; but wouldn't you like to cross the bridge and go up
                     on the Canada side, where you can get the best view of the falls? Take you up
                     there and give you all the time you want, and only charge the regular price—a
                     dollar and a half an hour."</p>
                  <p>It was true that this was only the legal rate. But Benjamin Bailey's knowledge
                     of team-work in the country, at three or four dollars per day, and of Smith's
                     livery charges for a horse and buggy in the dull village of Fallington, led him
                     to ask the driver with a look of surprise, if people generally paid such prices
                     here.</p>
                  <p>"Why, of course, stranger; only think, this hack and horses cost fifteen
                     hundred dollars; and it's only four months in the year that strangers come
                     here, and they are so rich and so many of them, that they keep every hack
                     busy."</p>
                  <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6367-00000077"/>
                  <p>"O, if it is the market price—all right, of course," said Bailey."</p>
                  <p>"Say, stranger," said the driver, getting off the subject of prices, "speakin'
                     of rich visitors, I wonder if some gentlemen don't come here to get acquainted
                     with rich young ladies? There's an awful sight of weddings here, and diamond
                     rings, and dances, all summer."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
                  <head type="sub">The Hack-driver continues to interest Benjamin—Other
                     Strangers—Another Custom House Officer—Gulliver's Driver—Smuggling talked
                     of—Hints of how it is done.</head>
                  <p>THEN they came to the spot where Blondin, the French rope-walker, stretched his
                     rope across the Niagara river in the summer of 1858. Here the driver stopped
                     his horses a moment, and recounted the daring and wonderful performances of
                     that great gymnast on his rope over the deep abyss, in which runs the rapid
                     river below the falls.</p>
                  <p>Although this driver was suspected by some strangers of telling fictitious
                     stories to interest passengers, and of exaggerating trifling incidents which
                     had occurred about the falls, in order to be considered an interesting guide,
                     still we must do him the compliment to affirm that such was not the case.</p>
                  <p>On one occasion a waggish stranger, who had employed Mr. Gulliver's driver, and
                     had humorously encouraged his narration of items of interest, jokingly asked
                     him, why he lied so about everything but Blondin?</p>
                  <p>"Why," said the driver, in reply, "I'm almost afraid to tell the <emph>whole
                        truth</emph> about that Frenchman, because it sounds like a bigger story
                     than anything I could get up. So you see I always feel as if I <emph>was
                        lying</emph> about him <emph>when I'm telling the truth!</emph>"</p>
                  <pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6367-00000078"/>
                  <p>As the driver pointed out to Bailey the spot where the rope, the first season
                     of these performances was stretched across the river, from "White's Pleasure
                     Grounds," Bailey inquired how far across the river it is at this point.</p>
                  <p>"About eleven hundred feet, sir."</p>
                  <p>"Is it possible," inquired Bailey, "that Blondin actually walked across there,
                     on a rope, as the newspapers told it, with a man on his back?"</p>
                  <p>"I beg leave to be eaten up by cannibals, sir, if he didn't! I saw him do it,
                     myself; and there was at least five thousand others lookin' on the same
                     time."</p>
                  <p>"How much did the man weigh?"</p>
                  <p>"One hundred and thirty pounds, sir; and besides that, the tough, little
                     Frenchman carried a balancing pole in his hands which weighed forty pounds,
                     sir."</p>
                  <p>"I declare, said Bailey, "that made one hundred and seventy pounds—nearly equal
                     to three bushels of wheat; and of course the man could not get off the
                     rope-walker's back, and get on again for fear of falling; so there was no way
                     of resting until he carried him clear across."</p>
                  <p>"Get off his back and get on again while on the rope? So help me Jehosophat!
                     that is just what he did do a half a dozen times!"</p>
                  <p>"Don't you find it hard work to make folks believe that story, driver?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir, but Blondin always did all he advertised to do; till at last
                     everybody would have believed he could walk across on nothing if he'd said
                     so"</p>
                  <p>"What else <emph>did</emph> he do?"</p>
                  <p>"What else? he took a good-sized sheet-iron stove, with a length of pipe on it,
                     out on the middle of the rope, and cooked buck-wheat cakes there for
                     refreshments. And at another time he took a strong-made chair out there,
                     balanced it on the rope, and stood up in the chair! And one night he walked
                     across with a torch-light at each end of his balancing stick, and when he got
                     half way across, all of a sudden the lights dropped off into the river, and
                     everybody was scart to death; they could not see whether he fell into the river
                     or what had become of him, but no, sir—"</p>
                  <p>"What in the world," said Bailey, half doubting the driver's word, "could he do
                     if it was dark as that, and his light went out?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, everybody waited awfully, for as much as five or ten minutes, and
                     although they was scared all to shivers, they kinder had faith in him; so they
                     held their breath, and in a few minutes they heard the crowd on the other side
                     of the river makin' the awfulest cheerin' you ever <emph>did</emph> see! We
                     knew then he'd got safe over Jordan, an' 'twas just his own trick—he didn't
                     need any light!<ref rend="super" target="#note_001" xml:id="return_001">*</ref>
                      Then the next season he put his rope across just below the Suspension
                     Bridge, and at the time the Prince of Wales was here lookin' at him—and the
                     bridge and river-banks were lined with spectators—I'll be eaten up by cannibals
                     if he didn't walk across on his rope, on <emph>stilts three feet high!</emph>
                     he did, sir!"</p>
                  <note place="foot" xml:id="note_001">
                     
                     <p><ref target="#return_001">*</ref>These incidents are literally true.</p>
                  </note>
                  <p>"There, driver, that's enough! At any rate it is all I can possibly
                     believe!"</p>
                  <p>"Well, it's as true as Jehosophat! and I 'spose if anybody<pb n="156-157"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000079"/> body rides with me they always want to know all
                     the points of interest; and it's no good to hire a guide about the Falls if he
                     jest takes you around and don't tell you nothin' what there is to see! I've had
                     gentlemen what's use to travelin' give me five dollars more'n they agreed to
                     many a time for understandin' my business!"</p>
                  <p>"That is the great railroad suspension bridge, is it, just before us?" inquired
                     Bailey.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir, that's the animal."</p>
                  <p>Bailey gazed in mute astonishment till the driver halted his team behind
                     another carriage, waiting his turn at the toll office, at the entrance upon the
                     bridge.</p>
                  <p>Here the driver (as was his custom with all his passengers) told Bailey that
                     people in general liked to ride across the bridge in their carriage going over,
                     and coming back they could walk on top, by the side of the railroad track, so
                     as to see the whole bridge.</p>
                  <p>At this moment in a little office opposite the toll office, Bailey observed a
                     man examining the contents of a valise which a gentleman had just brought in
                     his hand from off the bridge and from the Canada side. He also noticed that the
                     man so examining it, was attempting to soften the surprise of the owner by
                     saying: "Why, my dear sir, I don't inspect your baggage on the grounds of any
                     suspicion that you are actually smuggling; but this is the rule of the
                     custom-house, with every one."</p>
                  <p>"I don't believe any such nonsense!" replied the man with the valise, "and I
                     don't care about being humbugged in this way by officers that want to show a
                     little of their brief authority, looking at my old clothes."</p>
                  <p>This was the first customs business which Bailey had ever seen done; and he
                     suddenly concluded that he would like to stop and have a little talk with the
                     officer, and look about the bridge. So he informed the driver that he would
                     not, probably, go to the falls on the Canada side that day, and proceeded to
                     get out of the carriage. He then asked the driver how much he should pay
                     him.</p>
                  <p>"About a dollar and a half, sir," said the driver.</p>
                  <p>"All right," said Bailey, but as he handed out the money he again silently
                     thought of Smith's livery in Fallington, and although the driver had made only
                     the usual charge allowed by the authorities, and Bailey saw that he could only
                     blame himself for not having made a definite agreement for the distance he had
                     allowed the driver to serve him, yet judging from Smith's livery in Fallington,
                     he believed that this driver had overcharged him, and yet he rather admired his
                     shrewdness. Then Bailey thought suddenly of a stroke of policy. It was a common
                     saying of his, that "no matter how good a man's cause is, it needs good
                     management, and even good principles on this planet can not afford to lose
                     sight of shrewd policy!"</p>
                  <p>It occurred to Ben that he needed, or at least might need, the friendship of
                     just such a fellow on the frontier as this odd character, and so he told him in
                     a smiling way, that he would like a little private conversation with him.</p>
                  <p>At this the driver turned his team a little one side, and Bailey beckoned to
                     him in a confidential way, which caused the driver to descend from his
                     carriage, when<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6367-00000080"/> Bailey proceeded to
                     astonish him, by saying in a low tone:</p>
                  <p>"Well, driver, your infernal shrewdness convinces me that you are just the
                     fellow to help me, for good pay, in a little <emph>private business</emph> that
                     I propose to do. Perhaps I can turn a little <emph>money</emph> into your
                     pocket if you can help me. I don't want a man that has got any conscience, and
                     I am satisfied you would suit me," said Bailey, with a peculiar smile which
                     rather pleased the driver.</p>
                  <p>"What in the name of Jehosophat do you mean?" whispered the driver.</p>
                  <p>By this time Bailey had again opened his pocket-book, and the driver observing
                     him to take out a two dollar greenback, changed his smile from a doubtful
                     expression to one of evident satisfaction, which Bailey was careful to
                     observe—to read his man.</p>
                  <p>"There," said Bailey, putting the money into the driver's hand, "that is your
                     first instalment; call it for what you please."</p>
                  <p>"All right," said the driver, "every man has got his price! and I am of course
                     no exception to that rule."</p>
                  <p>"I expect to stay around here some months, so there will be time enough,
                     driver, to arrange particulars. Where can I see you?"</p>
                  <p>"I drive for Mr. Gulliver; here is his card; he can tell you where I live. But,
                     say! if I can get a passenger here in a little while, I'm going across to the
                     falls on the Canada side, and you can go along and I won't charge you a cent
                     more. Honest, I won't!"</p>
                  <p>"I'll see; perhaps I will go. But, driver, do carriages cross this bridge at
                     all hours during the night?"</p>
                  <p>'Of course they do, same as they do on any other road," said the driver.</p>
                  <p>"And you are an old guide?—perfectly posted on both sides of the river, are
                     you?" said Ben, in a confidential tone.</p>
                  <p>"Of course I am," whispered back the driver, "and I know exactly where to drive
                     to. But you must pay for the wine and take care of yourself, too, if that's
                     what you mean!"</p>
                  <p>"I don't exactly understand you," said Bailey.</p>
                  <p>"And perhaps I don't you," replied the driver, who took Bailey to be a fast
                     young man, with plenty of money to waste in dissipation on a spree at the
                     Falls!</p>
                  <p>"Well, it's no matter whether I understand you," said Bailey. "I want you to
                     understand me; will you keep a secret?"</p>
                  <p>"I will, sir, if I am paid for it!"</p>
                  <p>"Well, you have found me liberal to begin with. Now tell me how is the best way
                     for me to get some silk dress goods across from Canada without paying this
                     infernal duty of sixty per cent, in gold."</p>
                  <p>"Well, I 'spose I know a few of the tricks—been about here long enough—been a
                     guide and a hackman ten or eleven years about here—and smuggling isn't a thing
                     that's very scarce in these parts. And it's nothing very wrong, as I can see.
                     If 'tis, I happen to know that the richest of them will smuggle silks a dum
                     sight quicker than any hack-driver! But I don't calkerlate to risk this
                     carriage in the business, no how; for Mr. Gulliver is a straight-forward
                     man—the man that owns this carriage is."</p>
                  <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6367-00000081"/>
                  <p>"Well, perhaps you know some better way," said Bailey.</p>
                  <p>"No, not that; I mean—well—management! Ye see, suppose now, yourself and
                     lady—"</p>
                  <p>"But I haven't got any lady!" interrupted Bailey.</p>
                  <p>"Well, couldn't ye get one, if 'twas necessary? I'm <emph>supposin</emph>' a
                     case! Suppose yourself and lady—all the better if there was two of 'em—were
                     stoppin' here at a first class house, say like the Monteagle, right there in
                     sight, and suppose you hire me with a splendid carriage to take you across on
                     the Canada side to see the falls and Table Rock, or what there is left of it
                     since it tumbled down; well, suppose the women (ladies, of course,) go into any
                     hotel where youv'e got the silk all ready—couldn't a lady tie a whole piece of
                     silk around her just as easy as she could a big hoop skirt, or an old fashion
                     bustle? Jehosophat! I should like to know if she <emph>couldn't!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I see," said Bailey.</p>
                  <p>"Well, 'spose you paid me ten dollars for takin' you over there and back, you
                     don't think I'd be fool enough to know anything about it, do you? Not if the
                     court know herself, and she think she do, as Esquire Dickens always says when
                     he declines a small marriage fee—because it's too small!"</p>
                  <p>"Exactly so," said Bailey, smiling, "and yet I prefer to wait till I see you
                     get some others safe across in that way; of course I must be cautious, Mr.
                     driver."</p>

                  <p>THE driver with whom Ben Bailey was engaged in a low conversation, though
                     eagerly listening to the proposition about smuggling, at the same time was on
                     the watch for passengers for his carriage. In a little time the driver noticed
                     a gentleman and lady whom he knew to be strangers from the interest they
                     manifested in looking at the bridge, so he asked in his professional way:</p>
                  <p>"Have a carriage to go around and see the Falls, sir? and the Whirlpool on the
                     Canada side, sir?"</p>
                  <p>"I hardly think we shall have time," replied the stranger, in a good-natured
                     way. We've only an hour or two to look around before we are to take the cars
                     for the West."</p>
                  <p>"That will be plenty of time, sir, if you take a carriage, sir. Take you to the
                     falls on the Canada side or on this side, either, for a couple of dollars,"
                     continued the driver.</p>
                  <p>"Well, if you can get us back in time to take the next train for the West, I
                     guess we will go across the bridge and up to the falls on the Canada side, and
                     then to the Whirlpool," said the old gentleman.</p>
                  <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6367-00000082"/>
                  <p>"All right, get right aboard," said the driver, opening the door of the
                     carriage—"plenty of time!"</p>
                  <p>The two new passengers took seats in the carriage; the driver closed the door,
                     and got a chance to whisper to Bailey: "It's all right between you and me; get
                     aboard—on the seat with me. I see you intend to go in for your line of
                     business, and you see I understand mine in every department of it."</p>
                  <p>"Exactly so," said Bailey, with a significant smile, while he gave the driver a
                     familiar hunch with his elbow, as if they had been smugglers of old
                     acquaintance!</p>
                  <p>In a moment longer the carriage was before the toll office, and Bailey on the
                     seat with the driver. The driver whispered to Bailey to pay the toll-man
                     twenty-five cents, which Bailey did, and asked no questions. The toll-man then
                     informed the clever old gentleman in the carriage that the toll was "one
                     dollar."</p>
                  <p>"How is that?" said the passenger.</p>
                  <p>Bailey himself having just paid twenty-five cents for his own toll, was a
                     little curious too, to know the meaning of the one dollar charge.</p>
                  <p>The driver fearing that the high rate of toll might break up the prospect of
                     his bargain, informed his passengers of the fact that paid for coming back
                     also.</p>
                  <p>"Do you charge a half dollar each for passengers to cross this bridge and
                     return?" asked the old gentleman.</p>
                  <p>The gate-keeper explained that the toll was "twenty-five cents for each
                     passenger, and fifty cents for the carriage."</p>
                  <p>"See here! driver," said the clever old man, "you have made a contract to take
                     us to the falls and back on the Canada side for 'two dollars.' Now I suppose it
                     belongs for you to do as you agreed, which you was aware you could not do
                     without paying this toll. So what have I to do about the toll?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, passengers always do pay their own toll," said the driver. "So you see I
                     couldn't have thought nothin' about takin' any advantage of you!"</p>
                  <p>"How innocent!" thought Bailey.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, that <emph>is</emph> the custom," said the toll-man.</p>
                  <p>"Yes! and some mighty queer customs, too, travelers find that ever traveled
                     much. But sometimes I think, as I did about this war, that it's best to endure
                     all manner of evils, as they come, than it is to fight ourselves out of one
                     trouble into a dozen others! So here is your dollar for toll!"</p>
                  <p>"Driver, how long is this bridge?" inquired the clever old man.</p>
                  <p>"Eight hundred feet, sir."</p>
                  <p>"Pretty big toll, but a magnificent structure!" said the stranger, as they
                     entered upon the floor of the bridge which was tightly covered overhead, but
                     open like network at the sides.</p>
                  <p>"Driver, what was the cost of this bridge?" inquired Bailey.</p>
                  <p>"About four hundred thousand dollars in 1855, when money was like gold," said
                     the driver.</p>
                  <p>"Hark!" said the lady, "what is that overhead? Why, that's the cars, isn't it?
                     I'm afraid to go while the cars are over our heads!"</p>
                  <pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6367-00000083"/>
                  <p>"O, that's nothin'," said the driver, "there's freight or passenger cars or
                     engines goin' over almost all the while."</p>
                  <p>"Why, it sounds so <emph>frightful!</emph>" said the lady.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said the driver, "till ye get a little used to it. There was a feller
                     riding here with me the other day that said it sounded to him very much like
                        <emph>distant thunder close by!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"Don't the bridge sag any, when there's a neavy train on?" inquired the
                     stranger.</p>
                  <p>"They used to tell that story to make passengers go some other route; but it
                     don't sag more'n it allers did. It kinder has a little mite of sag where the
                     train is, and a little mite of rise where the train isn't! But it's stouter'n
                     Jehosophat! this bridge is. May be you would like to hear me tell you something
                     'bout this bridge that's mighty queer. Well, in the winter it arches itself
                     right up in the center twenty inches higher than 'tis in the summer time.
                     Looking out there to the left, would you think them Niagara Falls was two miles
                     off? Well, they be, and right under this bridge it's two hundred and fifty feet
                     down to the water. And there's a water-wheel down there with a long shaft that
                     turns the flour-mill, just by the toll-office there. Now look through the other
                     side of the bridge, down stream. Do you see how awful rough them rapids is?
                     Well, do you 'spose any boat ever went through there with any live man on
                     it?"</p>
                  <p>The passengers presumed not.</p>
                  <p>"Well, as true as Jehosophat! there was once three live men went down through
                     them rapids on a little steamboat. You see there was a small steamboat built,
                     and used for a pleasure and ferry-boat, where the river is pretty smooth, just
                     above here, and close below the falls; but when this bridge was built it didn't
                     pay to run the boat, so one day it absconded down through them rapids to get
                     away from a mortgage, where it could run in Canadian waters on Lake Ontario.
                     Mr. J. R. Robinson, the man the guide-books tell of doing such daring things
                     about the falls and rapids, was the captain on that trip, but nobody but the
                     current was boss; Robinson himself was thrown hilter-skilter, and the
                     smoke-pipe went to the deuce, and everything tumbled through like
                     Jimminettee!"</p>
                  <p>"Driver, is all this true, you are telling?"</p>
                  <p>"Of course 'tis, it's no use for drivers to tell big stories about what
                     happened here, lately; but when it's something further off, we have to tell it
                     just as we get it!"</p>
                  <p>"Right about the middle of the bridge once, about sundown, there was a man
                     murdered."</p>
                  <p>"Bless my soul!" exclaimed the lady, "what! somebody murdered right here, on
                     this very bridge!"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, and the folks had a talk around that the feller was goin' to get clear
                     'cause they couldn't tell which country had the right to hang him! for, don't
                     you see, one-half of the bridge is in Canada and tother half is in the United
                     States. But at last he settled the whole matter himself."</p>
                  <p>"Why, how could he settle a murder?"</p>
                  <p>"By jest dying in jail."</p>
                  <p>"What was the murder for?" asked the old gentleman.</p>
                  <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6367-00000084"/>
                  <p>"O, they were partners, and both too mean to live; and one of them got so mad
                     he thought so, and killed his partner for the privilege of being hung himself!
                     The way 'twas, when one stole anything he wouldn't divide!"</p>
                  <p>"And another awful thing happened here. An old resident—I knew him well—picked
                     out the very center of this bridge, on the north side of it, and sat down on
                     that railing, and waited until two of his neighbors came along, and then after
                     talking with them a few moments, he suddenly sprang from them and leaped off
                     into the rapids! You can't imagine what awful feelings them two friends of his
                     had as they watched him falling two hundred and fifty feet! They say it took
                     four seconds, and they heard him strike the water."</p>
                  <p>A few questions from the passengers, and at last to the great relief of the
                     lady, the carriage had passed the bridge; the driver had handed the tickets to
                     the toll-man at the Canadian end of the bridge, and had reported "nothing
                     aboard dutiable," to the officer of Canadian customs. He then drove up the
                     carriage road close by the high bank of the river, which was the usually
                     traveled road to the Clifton House, the Museum, Table Rock, and the falls on
                     the Canadian side, and the Burning Spring and the battle ground.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, and there was a love story happened on the bridge three or four years
                     ago," continued the driver.</p>
                  <p>"You know those three things, love, murder and suicide, do get mixed
                     sometimes."</p>
                  <p>"A love story on the bridge?" said Bailey.</p>
                  <p>"What kind of a happen was that?" said the lady; "and why didn't you tell us
                     that story while we were on the bridge, instead of such horrid things?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, there was a couple (a feller and a girl) who came here from way off in
                     Toronto, or Hamilton, or somewhere else in Canada, and got a United States
                     minister, one of the preachers here, to come out on the bridge and marry him
                     and his girl."</p>
                  <p>"Quite romantic!" said the clever old man.</p>
                  <p>"May be that was it, and may be he wanted to puzzle the lawyers," said the
                     driver, "on jurisdiction, in case he hadn't no right to marry the girl!"</p>
                  <p>"Bless my soul! what won't folks think of?" remarked the lady.</p>
                  <p>"Talk about getting married," said the driver, "you ought to see what a host of
                     Canadian couples come across this bridge to the American side to get married,
                     'cause the justices nor the American ministers don't make no bother marrying
                     folks, but in Canada they have to get licenses and advertise, and you know some
                     folks get off the notion before that time!"</p>
                  <p>"Driver, how did they manage to get the bridge across this place?"</p>
                  <p>"They sent the first of it over with a kite—I mean they got the first string
                     across with a kite—and then drew the first wire over by that string. When they
                     was windin' wire around them big wire cables that reach across the river over
                     the four stone towers that the bridge hangs on to, by the wire rope suspenders,
                     there was two of the men fell off the scaffold."</p>
                  <p>"Bless me! and they was drowned, weren't they?" said the lady.</p>
                  <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6367-00000085"/>
                  <p>"Drowned! I rather think they was! In the first place, they were killed a
                     falling so far; and then they were killed by striking the rocks on the slope of
                     the bank afore they got into the river; and then the rapids finished 'em by
                     'drowning' 'em, or tearing every rag of their clothes off; as it always
                        <emph>does,</emph> if anybody is ever found after falling into any of these
                     rapids—which sometimes they ain't."</p>
                  <p>"It's a wonder," said Bailey, "if there were no more accidents, building a
                     bridge over such a place!"</p>
                  <p>"I believe there wasn't, though," replied the driver. "But there was something
                     here, afore they finished the bridge, a great deal worse than accidents! In
                     these two little villages, (each side of the river,) there was over a hundred
                     died with the cholera; and half the folks that wasn't dead left the place.
                     There was a whole family of three died in one Irish shanty on the Canada side,
                     and the folks around it was so scart they actually burnt the shanty with the
                     bodies in it! as they were afraid to carry the bodies to bury them!"</p>
                  <p>"Was that really so?" interrupted the old gentleman.</p>
                  <p>"Why, that was awful!" exclaimed the lady.</p>
                  <p>"It's as true as Jehosophat!" said the driver, "for what I've told you, so far,
                     is what I have known myself, since I've been a guide about these falls. I know
                     it individually! And what's more, I had the cholera myself, and was dead more'n
                     two hours, or—'</p>
                  <p>"Hold on driver!" said the old gentleman.</p>
                  <p>"Whoa!" said the driver to his horses, pulling up on the reins.</p>
                  <p>"No, no, not stop your horses," said the old gentleman with a hearty laugh,
                     "but do you really think you were dead two hours?"</p>
                  <p>The driver loosened his reins, snapped his whip, and replied, joining the
                     passengers in the laugh:</p>
                  <p>"Two hours, if at all; at any rate, I was <emph>collapsed;</emph> and all of
                     'em said I was <emph>good</emph> as dead; and I know I wasn't
                        '<emph>live</emph> enough to <emph>know</emph> it, if I wasn't dead! I guess
                     I would have died any how, if it hadn't been for something that cured me just
                     at the last minute!"</p>
                  <p>But we have other things to notice, and we must omit what further took place on
                     this ride; simply saying that the rest of Benjamin Bailey's experience this day
                     was similar to that of thousands who visit Niagara Falls.</p>

                     transferred his baggage to the Cataract House. The day's events, its interest
                     and its excitement, had left him neither opportunity nor appetite for a meal at
                     tea-time; but he immediately went to his room, where he occupied the evening in
                     writing letters home to his friends; not forgetting to inclose a sprig of cedar
                     as a relic plucked from the bank of Niagara.</p>
                  <p>His journey by railroad, and his first impressions of the Falls and its
                     surroundings, drew him into lengthy epistles; and, even Gulliver's driver, not
                     only as a character himself, but on account of the incidents he had related,
                     was given a special paragraph among the matters of interest in Benjamin's first
                     day's experience at the Falls.</p>
                  <p>And for the benefit of the reader, we will here state that all the incidents
                     which Gulliver's driver related on that occasion, so far as we have recorded
                     them, were substantially correct, if we except his account of having once "had
                     the cholera himself, and been dead with it more than two hours," which latter
                     incident, if it ever did occur in the experience of Mr. Gulliver's driver—or of
                     any other person—we have no knowledge of the facts, though we were at the Falls
                     during the cholera season of 1854, and well recollect the incident of the three
                     bodies burned in the Irish shanty, on the Canada side of the river.</p>
                  <p>After two or three days spent as a visitor about the Falls, though keeping his
                     eyes open to his prospective business as a detective, Benjamin Bailey reported
                     for duty, and special instructions, to the collector of customs; on which
                     occasion, as he approached the door of the collector's office, he observed a
                     man just leaving the office in an opposite direction. He only caught a glimpse
                     of the man's face, but was almost certain he had seen him somewhere, before;
                     but did not quite identify him as George Bedan, his smuggling friend, whose
                     acquaintance he had made on the cars! When Bailey entered the office the
                     collector was busy signing some papers as they were handed him by his deputy.
                     Benjamin, before speaking, waited a few moments till he caught the collector's
                     attention.</p>
                  <p>Their eyes no sooner met than they recognized each other. It was not the
                     recognition, however, of persons acquainted, and yet they knew more of each
                     other than at this moment they were conscious of; for Mr. Baldwin and the
                     collector were personal as well as political friends; and it was by a mutual
                     understanding between them that Benjamin Bailey had been appointed as the
                     friend of Mr. Baldwin. But the collector this moment recognizes<pb n="172-173"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000087"/> Bailey only as the stranger who extended to
                     himself and Deacon Sommers the courtesy referred to on the cars. But this was
                     an introduction for which they who are careless of the smallest acts of
                     kindness and courtesy, may be more than repaid the cost of this volume, if
                     Benjamin Bailey's act in this one instance shall remind them to perform similar
                     acts of kindness, which surely will in the end, result in their own happiness
                     as well as that of others. And Bailey recognizes the gentleman whom he now
                     suspects may be the collector, as being one of two strangers to whom he gave up
                     his seat in the cars.</p>
                  <p>"May I inquire, sir," said Bailey, addressing the man he thus recognized, "if
                     the collector of customs is present?"</p>
                  <p>"I am the person you refer to; take a seat, sir," said he, with a good-natured
                     smile of recognition, "I shall be at liberty in just a moment."</p>
                  <p>"Any time, at your convenience, Mr. Collector," Benjamin replied, taking a
                     chair.</p>
                  <p>After signing his name to a few more papers the collector approached Bailey,
                     saying: "Isn't this the gentleman who gave us the seat in the cars the other
                     day?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir, I remember seeing you on the cars, but had no idea then," said
                     Bailey, with a smile of surprise, "that you were the collector of customs to
                     whom I had a letter of introduction from the Hon. Mr. Lyman Baldwin, through
                     whose kindness, together with your own, sir, I have the honor to report to you
                     for duty." And Benjamin had scarcely finished his reply before he had presented
                     the letter to the collector.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, indeed! Is this Mr. Bailey?"</p>
                  <p>"That is my name, sir."</p>
                  <p>The collector expressed his pleasure at seeing him, and introduced him to his
                     deputy as a new officer for the secret service. The deputy and Bailey entered
                     into conversation and the collector read the letter from Mr. Baldwin.</p>
                  <p>"Kingsley," said the collector, addressing the deputy, "have we any news of the
                     smugglers at Youngstown?"</p>
                  <p>"Nothing, besides the kegs of whisky seized last night in Mr. Chewbrick's
                     sail-boat."</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Bailey," said the collector, "are you acquainted with any of the places
                     along the Niagara River?"</p>
                  <p>"Only what I have seen since arriving here on Tuesday; have never been in this
                     section before; but in some respects I hope that may be an advantage; it may
                     help me to appear all the more natural, if I am inquisitive among the
                     smugglers."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, we can sometimes take advantage of a misfortune," replied the collector,
                     smiling.</p>
                  <p>"If," said Benjamin, "it prove a misfortune, I must at least see that it does
                     not get unnecessary advantage of me."</p>
                  <p>The collector, after a little general conversation—very little, for he was a
                     man of executive ability, not words—gave him some special instructions, and
                     requested him to call again the next day at two o'clock, when he would
                     introduce him to an officer who had been in the secret service two or three
                     years. "Mr. Bedan knows all the smugglers that own boats, and he can post you
                     up about<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6367-00000088"/> them, as well as the tricks
                     which others play to defraud the revenue."</p>
                  <p>As the collector mentioned Bedan's name, Bailey was on the point of asking the
                     detective's Christian name. Then it flashed across his mind that the man whom
                     he had just seen leaving the office was dressed like the Bedan he had talked
                     with on the cars, and had taken to be a smuggler. He was of the same size, his
                     clothes of the same color, same style, and his side whiskers were the same. It
                     was he, without the least doubt. But Bailey did not deem it best to introduce a
                     subject to the collector, which he and Bedan both, might think involved a joke
                     to be kept between themselves—for both had been equally deceived!</p>
                  <p>When Bailey left the collector's office he rambled along the river bank on his
                     way back to the Cataract House. On entering a small piece of woods, about
                     three-quarters of a mile from the Falls, he fell in company with a stranger,
                     with whom in a little time, he became quite sociable. They admired the scenery
                     together. When the stranger found Bailey was from the country, he thought there
                     was no business like farming; he had always followed it; he owned a nice farm
                     out West; he believed, too, that the farming community were more independent
                     and more honest than any other class of people.</p>
                  <p>Had Benjamin possessed the experience of some old police officers, he would
                     have been at least more likely to have thought of a class of traveling
                     pick-pockets and swindlers, who make their occasional visits to Niagara Falls,
                     as well as other places of fashionable resort—and would have looked more
                     critically at his new companion; in which case the Western farmer's hands would
                     have looked to Bailey more like following some "light-fingered" business than
                     "holding the plow!"</p>
                  <p>As it was, there was nothing in the appearance of the stranger that inclined
                     Bailey to suspect that he might be other than what he pretended; nor, did he
                     even think of swindlers, pick-pockets or robbers! What if the stranger was
                     loitering about that little strip of woods that one could almost see through?
                     Wasn't there just as good an apparent honest object for one stranger to be
                     there as another? Wasn't Bailey there himself to admire the scenery and enjoy
                     the grove?</p>
                  <p>They had just passed through the strip of woods towards the falls and the
                     village, when they met a man with a small valise, who, in fact, was a
                     confederate of the first stranger, and both were black-legs. The second
                     stranger made some inquiries, such as any stranger might be likely to make.
                     "Could either of the two gentlemen tell him what the short canal, which seemed
                     to have no other present use than to make an island of the village of Niagara
                     Falls, was intended for?"</p>
                  <p>Respecting the canal, Bailey had himself made inquiries concerning it, and was
                     able to tell him, that it was intended to furnish water-power for manufacturing
                     purposes, but after expending three or four hundred thousand dollars upon it,
                     it had ever since lain idle.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, indeed! Well, gentlemen," said the man with the little valise, as he
                     opened it, "let me show you an improvement which I think one of the greatest
                        discoveries<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6367-00000089"/> eries of the age. Of
                     course you need not buy it if you don't choose to."</p>
                  <p>"On those conditions," said Bailey, "of course I can have no objections to
                     looking at what you wish to show, sir."</p>
                  <p>"I have but little time to spare," said the Western farmer, "as I wish to meet
                     a friend at the Cataract House."</p>
                  <p>The man then took a vial from his valise, which he said was a composition for
                     silver plating. He proceeded to show what lasting wonders it had wrought, and
                     could be made to do, as he said, on any smooth metal. He silvered over a brass
                     spoon or a spoon of some badly tarnished metal, which, when done, he declared
                     would last ten years without wearing off!</p>
                  <p>To this, however, Bailey ventured to suggest a proviso, "that it be kept
                     carefully wrapped in a soft piece of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chamois</foreign>
                     skin, laid away in a dry place, and carefully left there."</p>
                  <p>"O, no, I guess that's a good thing," said the "Western farm" man. "How much a
                     bottle do you ask for it, sir?"</p>
                  <p>"One dollar for the four ounce vials, and fifty cents for the two ounce," was
                     the reply.</p>
                  <p>"And how much is the lowest you take?" asked Bailey, with a joking smile.</p>
                  <p>"The same as I ask for it, sir," returned the disguised black-leg.</p>
                  <p>"See here," said the first stranger to Bailey, "that <emph>is</emph> a good
                     thing, no mistake! See! you can't rub it off one mite!"</p>
                  <p>Bailey looked at it; tried to rub it off; and remarked that "it
                        <emph>appeared</emph> pretty good, but it would take some time to try it a
                        <emph>year!</emph> though perhaps hot dish-water, or strong vinegar might
                     try it in <emph>less</emph> time, pretty well!"</p>
                  <p>"See here," said the "silver-polish" man to Bailey, "you talk as if hot water,
                     or vinegar, could penetrate silver!"</p>
                  <p>"O, he's only joking," said the "Western farm" man. It's no doubt a good thing;
                     in fact, it looks like some I've tried myself; I silvered over a set of the
                     worst looking spoons you ever saw and an old teapot, two or three years ago,
                     and they look as good as genuine silver yet! and have been in constant use ever
                     since. It's called a big discovery in our section; but it's hard to find a
                     bottle of it now; and I'll buy a bottle of you."</p>
                  <p>"The recipe for that article cost me a hundred dollars, and I <emph>know</emph>
                     it is good; and when a man tries to show <emph>just what a thing is,</emph> and
                     you can <emph>see</emph> it, what is the use of thinking everything and
                     everybody is a cheat and a humbug?" said the "polish" man, showing the
                     tarnished spoons and the polished ones by contrast.</p>
                  <p>The "Western farm" man took the silver plating compound and handed the "polish"
                     man a five dollar bill, which he looked at sharply, and then asked Bailey if it
                     was good.</p>
                  <p>Bailey looked at it, but said he was no judge of money; which was precisely
                     what these two black-legs desired to know.</p>
                  <p>"What will you take for the recipe?" asked the pretended farmer.</p>
                  <pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6367-00000090"/>
                  <p>"I've sold a good many recipes for twenty dollars," said the "polish" man.</p>
                  <p>Finally a bargain was made at fifteen dollars. But on looking in his
                     pocket-book the "Western farmer" found he would have to give him a fifty dollar
                     bill to change.</p>
                  <p>The "silver plate" man took the fifty dollar bill, saying, "it's a good bill,
                     but I haven't got money enough with, me to change it. Perhaps your friend here
                     can change it," and they both made a very innocent and inquiring look toward
                     Bailey.</p>
                  <p>Bailey hesitated a moment, but finally said "he did not like to change such
                     large bills, for the reason as he had already told them, that he was not a good
                     judge of money!"</p>
                  <p>This of course did not suit the plan of the two "confidence men;" for, the bill
                     was a counterfeit; and, it was their business to pass it. But they had gained a
                     point; they found he had money with him. How are they to get it of a man so
                     cautious? It was not a safe hour for robbery; though one or two instances of
                     daylight robberies had occurred some years back in that vicinity.</p>
                  <p>"If this gentleman don't like to risk changing the bill I will get it changed,"
                     said the "farmer," "at the Cataract House, where I am stopping, if you will go
                     back to the village with me."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, but that will make me later to the Suspension Bridge than I like to be,"
                     objected the "polish" man.</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps you would cash a draft of fifty-one dollars for me?" said the "farmer"
                     to Bailey, "and I can exchange back with you, as soon as we get to the Cataract
                     House."</p>
                  <p>This game of getting off a fraudulent draft as security for money, for "just a
                     little while," is a game which has been successfully tried on strangers at the
                     Falls and elsewhere, who have seen and read too little for reasonable
                     caution.</p>
                  <p>But Bailey declined to cash the draft, giving as a reason that he was not
                     acquainted with the parties!</p>
                  <p>Bailey's new companion and the "polish" man, now, both joined in cursing out an
                     opinion, that "no man could be so devilish disobliging, unless he was some
                     outrageous scoundrel, that didn't want to show what kind of money he
                     carried!"</p>
                  <p>Suddenly at some kind of signal, understood by themselves, they both sprang to
                     their feet, and each presenting pistols to Bailey, the "Western farm" man
                     declared "if he stirred hand or foot they would blow his brains out;" for,
                     said, he, "since I've been walking with you back here, you've picked my
                     pockets, and that is why you dare not show the money you've got!"</p>
                  <p>"And I <emph>saw you do it!</emph>" said the other.</p>
                  <p>"Raise your hands while this man searches you for my money, or you are a dead
                     man—and we fling you over the precipice!" said the innocent farmer.</p>
                  <p>"Men, I am unarmed, and of course in your power," said Bailey, who had
                     carelessly left his revolver in his trunk.</p>
                  <p>The "polish" man searched Bailey first for weapons; finding none, he took his
                     money; but returned his pocket-book and papers.</p>
                  <p>"Now complain of us and we complain of you. Your<pb n="180-181"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000091"/> life is safe till you make complaint—and we are
                     safe if you do complain, for <emph>I can prove you took my money!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>At this moment Bailey saw a man approaching near them; and, for a moment felt a
                     sense of relief; but the next moment the "Western" man astonished Bailey by
                     calling out to the new comer:</p>
                  <p>"Say! stranger, perhaps you <emph>saw</emph> this young man pick my pocket back
                     there?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir, I did, and am ready to swear to it!"</p>
                  <p>"Well, I've got my money back!" said the "farmer."</p>
                  <p>"If such witnesses were common," ventured Bailey, "law might as well be
                     abolished! for it would soon become a 'remedy' worse than any disease!"</p>
                  <p>"I bid you good day, sir," said the "Western farm" man to Bailey, as he walked
                     away in an opposite direction from the Cataract House.</p>
                  <p>"And if you don't want to buy a bottle of my silver plating compound, I may as
                     well be going, too," said the other, as he walked off with the "farm" man.
                     "But, say! you better have a bottle, it would polish up your manners!"</p>
                  <p>"I say! stranger," said the "farm" man, "if you make us any more trouble, THERE
                        <emph>is an honest witness! and</emph> HERE—<emph>a revolver!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"It don't look, now, as if I were in a position to trouble you!" muttered
                     Bailey, as he started toward the "Falls" village; and noticed that the new
                     comer was slowly walking in the same direction.</p>
                  <p>"Then you are going to swear you saw me rob that man, are you?" asked Bailey of
                     the new stranger, eyeing his dark visage and long, black beard.</p>
                  <p>"Why, of course I should have to swear to the <emph>truth!</emph> the truth is
                     the only thing I <emph>could</emph> swear to!"</p>
                  <p>"And you would advise <emph>me</emph> not to complain, if <emph>they</emph>
                     don't!" added Bailey, with a slight appreciation of the tragic ridiculous!</p>
                  <p>"I certainly should," replied the stranger, with an air of disinterested
                     indifference, and apparently turning to take a look at the river scenery.</p>
                  <p>"Do you know those two men?" asked Bailey.</p>
                  <p>"No, sir, I don't make myself intimate with strangers, when traveling!" he
                     replied, as he ceased walking, braced against his cane, held his lighted cigar
                     in his delicate fingers, and gazed at the high, rising mist of the falls, as if
                     he were some sublime meditator, too devoted to let such a small matter as a
                     highway robbery divert his thoughts from the soul-inspiring scenes of
                     Niagara!</p>
                  <p>Bailey felt, now, more inclined to increase his pace toward the village than to
                     waste time with this mysterious witness; who, whatever he might appear in
                     court, was to Bailey clearly an accomplice of the other two villains, and whose
                     part in the plot was, to be a "witness" to swear the guilty free, or assist to
                     intimidate the injured and the innocent from making complaint!</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Excitement in the Bar-room—More about the Black-legs—"Dis be der
                     Bolice"—A Stranger talked of in the Village of Niagara Falls—A Talk of Laura's
                     Lovers—Deacon Sommers puzzled.</head>
                  <p>"THIS will never do," said Benjamin to himself, as he quickened his pace—"never
                     do for me to be outgeneraled by black-legs and robbers the very first day I
                     have reported myself for duty as a detective of smugglers! This is no small
                     matter; it may get into the newspapers, and it must not go there as it stands
                     now. The only merit the public seems to recognize is <emph>success.</emph> Even
                     an honest failure gets more disgrace than a successful humbug, or than a
                     profitable bargain gotten up by deception and fraud. Why, if these very
                     scoundrels had got their counterfeit money or forget drafts on me, strangers as
                     they were, they would have been called 'sharp,' and the Lord only knows what
                     the public would have called me! As it is, I hereby give Benjamin Bailey notice
                     that he must capture those thundering scamps, dead or alive. Deacon Sommers and
                     Laura must not have the chance to hear that Benjamin Bailey was a coward! But,
                     of course, I must have weapons. It would have been only brave foolishness for
                     me to have resisted two armed highwaymen, unarmed as I was."</p>
                  <p>The first house to be reached was the Frontier Hotel. Benjamin soon entered it,
                     exhibiting no small degree of excitement, in spite of his efforts to appear
                     otherwise.</p>
                  <p>"Give me a gun!" said he to the landlord, "I must capture two highwaymen in
                     twenty minutes, or they will escape! There is no time for delay or explanation!
                     Give me a gun—a rifle, shot-gun, carbine, pistol, anything, the best thing you
                     have!"</p>
                  <p>As might be expected, Bailey's sudden as well as his excited appearance,
                     created no little excitement in the bar-room. One Dutchman held his
                     half-emptied lager beer glass by the handle, while he inquired of another
                     German, better versed in English:</p>
                  <p>"Was meint der mann? Was ist gethan? Ist der teüfel hier?"</p>
                  <p>At the same time a soldier handed Bailey a large revolver, and the landlord
                     produced a double-barrel gun.</p>
                  <p>"Mein Gott!" exclaimed another Dutchman, who had just emptied his glass of
                     "lager," and stood bewildered by the movements, and the hasty English of those
                     who best understood Bailey.</p>
                  <p>"Mein Gott! ist die gun schus some dings? Der mann ist viel mad, don't he? Vot
                     for vill he make some dead mans?"</p>
                  <p>"Are these loaded?" asked Bailey.</p>
                  <p>"The revolver isn't; but here are some cartridges," said the soldier.</p>
                  <p>"The <emph>gun</emph> is well loaded," said the landlord.</p>
                  <p>"Is there any policemen at hand?"</p>
                  <p>"I've sent for one up town," replied the landlord.</p>
                  <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6367-00000093"/>
                  <p>"And he will probably be here, be jabers, by the time you don't want him!"
                     added an Irish porter.</p>
                  <p>"Cannot wait an instant," said Bailey. "Whose buggy is this, before the
                     door?"</p>
                  <p>"Mine," said the landlord.</p>
                  <p>"Send a man to drive me a mile or more, and I'll overtake the scoundrels!"</p>
                  <p>"Und I go mit sie," said one of the landlord's porters.</p>
                  <p>"Hier!" said another Dutchman, coming from behind the bar with a large cavalry
                     pistol, "hier ist einander shootsen ding waan sie will maken some powder
                     in!"</p>
                  <p>Benjamin seized it, and with loaded gun and two empty pistols—the latter he
                     thought might answer for a show in arresting the robbers—he and the porter, for
                     a driver, jumped into the buggy, and the next moment were riding rapidly down
                     the river road. A sharp eye was kept along the bank, but they saw no person,
                     not even the mysterious witness, till after riding about a mile and a half,
                     Benjamin saw two men disappear from view, near the end of a high board fence,
                     close by the railroad. He pointed them out to the driver, who informed him that
                     there were some desperate bad characters living in the house close by
                     there.</p>
                  <p>"Faster, then, and I'll get out at the end of that fence and head them off. My
                     gun is all right, but this thundering revolver isn't! But no matter, if we can
                     get near the rascals; you take this big pistol, and take aim when I do!"</p>
                  <p>"Der teivel! und sie tinks I shoots waan sie shootsen auch! und dis ding go
                     nit, mit no powder in!"</p>
                  <p>"But will you make believe, all but the shoot?"</p>
                  <p>"O, yes, I scare dem. I go mit sie, all but die shoots!"</p>
                  <p>A few moments later and the well-broke livery horse was left standing in the
                     road; while Bailey stood at the end of the fence. His double-barrel gun was in
                     a position for instant use, and a part of a revolver could be seen projecting
                     from his side pocket. The two robbers were facing him at a doubtful distance
                     for the aim of their revolvers, but not for Bailey's gun.</p>
                  <p>"Halt, scoundrels, or you are dead men! You are our prisoners!" exclaimed
                     Bailey, in a voice that left no room to doubt his intentions.</p>
                  <p>The two robbers halted, and as they whispered to each other, Benjamin
                     continued:</p>
                  <p>"Disobey one order and I shall take pleasure in demonstrating the fact that
                     this gun will shoot twice—at a very short interval!"</p>
                  <p>The Dutchman, too, assumed the appearance of having a commendable amount of
                     courage, making a very significant demonstration with the big pistol, as he
                     moved within supporting distance of Bailey, and exclaimed:</p>
                  <p>"Dis be der bolice!"</p>
                  <p>The robbers saw that their late acquaintance was in no mood to be trifled with.
                     Bailey had assumed command.</p>
                  <p>"Before you make another move," said he, "take out your revolvers and lay them
                     on the ground!"</p>
                  <p>This order was silently obeyed.</p>
                  <p>It is probable that the robbers decided to show no signs of guilt, and to rely
                     on the evidence of the "mysterious" witness to clear them; though their first
                        intentions<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6367-00000094"/> tions may have been to
                     secrete themselves till dark, at some point down the bank of the river, which
                     Benjamin's quick movements had frustrated.</p>
                  <p>"Raise your hands!" ordered Bailey. "Higher, as I did mine, when you rifled my
                     pockets; or this gun shall rifle your bodies!"</p>
                  <p>"Now keep together, and march to the right! There, halt!"</p>
                  <p>The robbers again whispered to each other, but obeyed orders.</p>
                  <p>The Dutchman, by Bailey's direction, secured the weapons of the robbers, and in
                     due time all were in marching order for Niagara Falls village. The two robbers
                     advanced in the road, in front of Bailey; the porter driving behind them.</p>
                  <p>"Hands away from your pockets, there!" said Bailey.</p>
                  <p>"You can keep my money with you, you honest 'Western farmer,' and you 'silver
                     polish' man, till we reach the Justice's office!"</p>
                  <p>In due time the captives were marched into the village, where a police officer
                     now made his appearance, and took them into custody.</p>
                  <p>Bailey's money was found on the person of the "Western farmer." In due time the
                     two highwaymen had their trial. By marks upon two of the bank notes Benjamin
                     proved the money to be his, and where he had obtained it. The "mysterious
                     witness" appeared, but refusing to answer certain important questions which
                     would have probably led to an exposure of his own true character, no confidence
                     was placed in his testimony. The robbers were convicted and sent to prison.</p>
                  <p>The evening of the robbery and the next day, the bold and energetic maneuver of
                     the stranger who captured the two robbers without waiting for policemen or
                     other assistance, except to procure weapons and a conveyance, was the subject
                     of talk among the strangers at the hotel, as well as among the citizens of
                     Niagara Falls village. Who is the man that marched those robbers into the
                     village? was one of the questions which almost everybody asked, but which
                     nobody seemed able to answer to anybody's satisfaction. The next day after the
                     affair, Deacon Sommers was in the post-office, and he asked the same question
                     of the post-master.</p>
                  <p>"I have heard two stories," was the reply. "Some say it was Bailey. I supposed
                     at first that they meant one of the Baileys living in the village here. But
                     Dawson, the livery man, says Gulliver heard that it was a stranger stopping at
                     the Cataract House—says he is a young man, rather slim, and not very tall."</p>
                  <p>"Did Mr. Gulliver hear what his name is?" inquired Deacon Sommers.</p>
                  <p>"I declare, now!" said the post-master, "I cannot remember whether Gulliver
                     said his name is Bailey or not. But he said they called him an
                     intelligent-looking fellow—had sandy whiskers and was well dressed."</p>
                  <p>When Deacon Sommers got home, he told the news; gave the description of the
                     young man who captured the robbers, as one account gave it, and the name,
                     Bailey, as another rumor had it.</p>
                  <p>Laura Sommers declared it to be her decided opinion that <emph>that</emph>
                     description and the name, Bailey, meant Benjamin<pb n="188-189"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000095"/> min Bailey, and nobody else! and she wished she
                     could see him, if he had come to Niagara Falls; she could not see the need of
                     being so delicate, or so something, that they would not let Benjamin know the
                     facts, and defend himself, if he could. She was satisfied from what they had
                     already heard, that Judge Bailey was a "miserable sinner!" and that he ought to
                     blush every time he read those words in the prayer books!</p>
                  <p>"Why, daughter," suggested Deacon Sommers, "even if Benjamin Bailey is a good,
                     common sort of a young man, it could not have been pleasant after things got as
                     they were!"</p>
                  <p>"Father, now don't you think that it was an act of injustice for us not to give
                     him an opportunity (when he so politely requested the privilege) to show, if he
                     could, that he had been misrepresented?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, daughter, you know it cannot be helped now. And there was the young
                     minister, here, a much better husband for you, if you could only think so; and
                     there is Col. Le Grange. The Colonel is a good fellow—always has been an
                     anti-slavery man; and there is no doubt but he is wealthy. The minister, too,
                     he gets a good salary."</p>
                  <p>"Father, in reference to the minister, what more could I say than that <emph>I
                        dislike him?</emph> or, of the Colonel, I do not <emph>love</emph> him? In
                     deference to my father's good judgment, and in obedience to his expressed
                     wishes, I have been able to refuse the one I loved! but marry one I do not
                     love? No, dear father, never!"</p>
                  <p>And with these words the tears came to her eyes, and she left the presence of
                     her parents, and went sad and sorrowful to her room.</p>
                  <p>"Why, de Lord sakes!" said Dinah to Mrs. Sommers, the next moment after passing
                     Laura in the hall, "de massa sakes alive! ef Miss Laura don't hab Benjamin she
                     won't hab nobody! Hih, he! I wouldn't say dat ef I had—two beaux! I heer'd
                     Massa Higley say, once, down South, dat it was agin' de Bible to be so mighty

                  <p>"There, Dinah," interrupted Mrs. Sommers, "you may sweep the dining-room out,
                     now."</p>
                  <p>"De Lord sakes! Missus, hih, he! does ye know what Miss Laura axes me,
                     yesterday? hih, he!"</p>
                  <p>"Why, what was it, Dinah?"</p>
                  <p>"Wal, when I tole her dat I had sweept her room out, she axes me, '<emph>out
                        where?</emph>'"</p>
                  <p>"Did you tell her, Dinah?"</p>
                  <p>"I tole her not to be skeered, 'cause I could sweep it all in agin ef she said
                     so; but she didn't say nuffin after dat, hih, he."</p>
                  <p>"There, Dinah, you need not talk any more, now."</p>
                  <p>"No, ma'am," said Dinah, as she left the room.</p>
                  <p>"Husband," said Mrs. Sommers, "suppose you and I make a visit to Fallington in
                     a few weeks. You have not visited cousin Gertrude's family in several years.
                     These letters are so contradictory we can tell nothing about them. Suppose
                     their minister did say, that so far as he could find out the facts, things had
                     been exaggerated against Judge Bailey by his enemies. After all, you cannot say
                     but things look bad against him. I don't<pb n="190-191"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000096"/> believe Mrs. Hartley's letter can be
                        <emph>all</emph> false. Then everything Judge Bailey or his family say
                     against Benjamin—see how afraid they are of having it inquired into! They would
                     not for a long time even tell the girl's name who, they said, could tell such
                     hard things against Benjamin Bailey. And then when they <emph>did</emph> tell
                     us, it turned out to be one in their own house—Jerusha Vroman—the very one whom
                     we have heard of before with no credit to herself or to Judge Bailey, either!
                     Why, nobody has <emph>started</emph> anything against Benjamin Bailey that we
                     have heard of, but what came first from them!"</p>
                  <p>"It is an unpleasant affair, anyhow," said Deacon Sommers.</p>
                  <p>"Unpleasant, of course, but when they call him a half-witted fellow, why, I saw
                     enough of him to know they could not say such things without some base motive
                     for it! I begin to think that Mrs. Hartley's letter is true, and that Judge
                     Bailey had some idea of helping his son to get Laura for a wife, long, long
                     before David's letter to her!"</p>
                  <p>"Tut, tut, wife, it does not look very likely that Benjamin Bailey, and David
                     Bailey, and Judge Bailey, all fell into such extravagant admiration of Laura,
                     and that the old Judge contrived a game against Benjamin, and hired Jerusha to
                     tell such down-right falsehoods as you must think she has told, and all to help
                     David to get a girl he had not at the time asked for! And did not Laura,
                     herself, know that David was paying attention to another girl? Even if Judge
                     Bailey be a bad man, I can not see that he could have had at first any bad
                     motive to deceive us; it would be a queer man that would get up falsehood and
                     trouble without motive to prompt him."</p>
                  <p>"And yet," said Deacon Sommers, putting in a cautious proviso, "it may be that
                     I was wrong, and your first impressions and Laura's were right—time may tell! I
                     do blame myself for not taking more pains to find out the facts and to know
                     more about Benjamin Bailey. And in two or three weeks, perhaps, we
                        <emph>had</emph> better make a visit to Fallington, so that I can satisfy
                     Laura how things are, if we can find out."</p>

                  <head type="sub">A Singular Comparison of Letters—How a Minister proposed to
                     Laura—How a Colonel proposed—Laura's Opinion of them.</head>
                  <p>A FEW moments after Deacon Sommer's last remark, recorded in the preceding
                     chapter, Laura reëntered the room with a package of letters, and asked her
                     father if he would please read and compare Benjamin Bailey's first letter to
                     her with the minister's and the Colonel's, and then say if he did not think
                     Benjamin's the best in every respect.</p>
                  <p>The Colonel's letter was received by Laura almost immediately on her return
                     from Fallington; and the minister's four or five months before Benjamin
                     Bailey's arrival at Niagara Falls. Laura had given to each a respectful and
                     decided answer, that she could not reciprocate the sentiments expressed in
                     their letters.</p>
                  <p>Deacon Sommers would have been pleased either with the minister or the colonel
                     for his son-in-law. The Deacon was a high Calvinist, as well as an anti-slavery
                     man, and when the minister, the next Sabbath after the Fort Pillow massacre of
                     Union negro soldiers, prayed that the Almighty would "destroy the rebel armies
                     and send them quickly down to hell,"<ref rend="super" target="#note_002"
                        xml:id="return_002">*</ref>
                      the Deacon approved every word of it, and liked him better than ever.
                     He also admired the colonel as a man entertaining the same "radical
                     principles," and as a man who possessed the kind of courage necessary to aid in
                     carrying out the mundane portion of the preacher's prayer.</p>
                  <note place="foot" xml:id="note_002">
                     
                     <p><ref target="#return_002">*</ref>This is an exact quotation from the prayer of a Presbyterian clergyman,
                        made in a village near Niagara Falls.</p>
                  </note>
                  <p>The idea of comparing the first letters written by these two suitors and
                     Benjamin Bailey, the Deacon remarked, was a matter of no importance, and he
                     believed he had learned the substance of them when first received.</p>
                  <p>"But you have never seen them together," said Laura, "and perhaps a comparison
                     with the minister's letter might convince you that Judge Bailey was at least
                     mistaken as to Benjamin's being a young man of very 'inferior abilities,'
                     having a 'poor education,' etc. I cannot help forming some opinion of people by
                     their letters! It takes a good deal of good sense, in my opinion, to write a
                     good letter; and it means as much sometimes as dollars and cents! I don't like
                     egotism in a letter nor in a minister. I don't like to hear a minister talk as
                     if he expected the congregation to believe him an inspired interpreter of
                     scripture. And I don't like a man any better because he happens to be a
                     colonel, and thinks his lips were made to hold tobacco—or to be too
                     commanding!"</p>
                  <p>"Daughter, you are getting severe in your criticisms," said the Deacon, with a
                     smile.</p>
                  <p>"Not much more severe, father, than our minister was with the rebel
                     slave-holders, not long ago," responded Laura, with a blush. "But I wish you
                     would read and compare these letters, father, just to please me, this
                     once."</p>

                  <p>Finally, Deacon Sommers was prevailed on to read the letters. First, he read
                     Benjamin Bailey's, which ran as follows:</p>

                              <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Dear Stranger—If there be those who might in strict
                                 etiquette criticise me for writing this letter to a lady to whom I
                                 am probably unknown, I can but hope that my reasons for doing so,
                                 with the honorable intentions which I bear toward the lady I am
                                 addressing, will be kindly regarded.</p>
                              <p>"I have seen you on three occasions, but have merely learned your
                                 name, and that yourself and your mother are visiting at Mrs.
                                 Cummings'. Seeing no prospect of a favorable opportunity for an
                                 introduction to you through acquaintances, I have thought it not
                                 improper to address you this letter.</p>
                              <p>"As an assurance to you of my sincerity, and of my consciousness
                                 that no one can say aught against my moral character, allow me to
                                 say, that I have always lived near Fallington village, and
                                 consequently your, friends, if you desire, can easily make
                                 inquiries concerning me. To make this letter a better introduction
                                 of myself, I will state that I am the person whom you probably saw
                                 in conversation with Mr. Baldwin yesterday, as yourself and Miss
                                 Cummings came into his store. You may have also seen me at church.
                                 I occupied the pew in front of Miss Cummings and yourself last
                                 Sabbath.</p>
                              <p>"I should be happy to make your acquaintance; and with that
                                 purpose, may I ask the favor of an interview, at the house of your
                                 friend, at such time as will be most convenient to yourself?</p>
                              <p>"Anxiously awaiting your reply, I am with sentiments of high
                                 esteem,</p>

                  <p>"Yes, daughter," said Deacon Sommers, as he finished reading the letter, "there
                     is a sort of candid, honest and sensible look about that letter, I admit. But
                     seeing the writer of it face to face, I might get a far different impression of
                     him."</p>
                  <p>And yet it is not four days since Deacon Sommers did see him! If he could now
                     know that the writer of that letter to his daughter, was the same young man he
                     had so lately met upon the cars, with whose manners he had been so pleased, how
                     it might disarm his prejudice! And then, could the veil of falsehood be turned
                     aside which has been thrown between the Sommers family and Benjamin Bailey,
                     what changes might it make! How it might effect the happiness of the innocent,
                     and disclose the motives of the guilty! When and how will this take place? Or,
                     will secrecy forever hide and shield the guilty to let the innocent suffer?</p>
                  <p>To the remarks of her father, at the close of Benjamin Bailey's letter, Laura
                     made no reply, but anxiously watched his countenance as he took up the
                     minister's letter and read as follows:</p>

                                 letter. You may be surprised at receiving the first intimation of
                                 these sentiments in a letter instead of my calling to talk with you
                                 about the matter. But I feel too deep an interest in your welfare,
                                 both earthly and spiritual, to say what I would in words that pass
                                 away with speaking; and which in this form, of a letter, we both
                                 might wish to keep as a memento of an <emph>era</emph> in our

                                 more useful among my dear flock. Indeed it was an objection among
                                 some of the dear people which they raised against my taking charge
                                 of this church and instructing them in spiritual things, that I was
                                 not yet married; and they would perhaps do better to pay a larger
                                 salary to another clergyman who had a wife. I therefore ask the
                                 pleasure of seeing you at your home to-morrow evening to express my
                                 views on some essential points, and leave it with you to consider
                                 whether you would be willing to be my wife, in which case if you
                                 are not already orthodox in religious belief, I should take great
                                 happiness in instructing you as well as my dear congregation, in
                                 the truth respecting spiritual things and the true meaning of

                  <p>"Yes, I think so, too," said Laura, "and I don't see how any young lady could
                     like a man who would write her such a letter. It seemed to me when I first read
                     it that he had a confused idea that he was writing to a small child, to a young
                     lady, and to his 'dear flock!' It was difficult for me to determine whether he
                     was intending to marry for love or to advance his business as a preacher; or
                     whether he would be my husband or my spiritual school-master! Before I would
                     marry such ridiculous egotism, and such spiritual impudence, I would rather
                     marry Col. Le Grange, as I have said before, and have him go immediately 'in
                     the front of battle,' as he said, and lay down his life on the altar of his
                     country!'"</p>
                  <p>Laura smiled, as she added: "Please read the <emph>Colonel's</emph> letter now.
                     No matter if you did read it when I first received it. You see it is my fortune
                     to get letters that bear reading <emph>twice.</emph>"</p>
                  <p>Deacon Sommers smiled, and proceeded to read the following:</p>

                                 sincere affections, and to declare that I love you as I love life
                                 itself. For, without your society, or at least without the hope
                                 that I may sometime in the future, have you to cheer my home, I
                                 shall be wretched, and life to me be of no further value.</p>

                                 them. You can ask not sacrifice I would not willingly make for your
                                 sake. I admit that from some remarks which you have made to me, I
                                 have little expectation that you will accept my proposal; but I
                                 await your answer, and if your reply be unfavorable, I can only
                                 add, in proof of my devotion to you, that I shall then seek the
                                 front of battle to lay down my miserable life on the altar of my
                                 country; for I shall have, myself, no further use for life.</p>

                  <p>In the course of reading this letter Deacon Sommers' countenance several times
                     manifested a slight struggle between a smile and an effort to be serious. For
                     while he thought the colonel's letter too extravagantly in advance of Laura's
                     feelings to gain his object, it certainly was a serious question who was to be
                     the future husband of his daughter. And when finally he handed back the letters
                     to Laura she very naturally expected her father would express an opinion as to
                     the comparison of the letters. For a few moments Deacon Sommers was silent. But
                     Laura, with exceedingly good tact, desiring to find out the impression which
                     alone the comparison had produced in her father's mind, remained silent also,
                     till her father spoke. At last he said:</p>
                  <p>"Daughter, such letters addressed by a gentleman to a lady upon a subject to
                     generally embarrassing, are the most difficult of any in the world for a man to
                     write. I know how it was when I was young!"</p>
                  <p>"I perceive, father, that you mean what you say as an apology; and as you are
                     so much of a friend to the minister and to the colonel, too, I conclude you are
                     apologizing for <emph>their</emph> letters—not Benjamin Bailey's!"</p>
                  <p>"But is not the apology a good one?" asked Deacon Sommers, smiling.</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps it is; but it is better still, where none is needed," was Laura's
                     quick response.</p>
                  <p>At this reply Laura's mother gave a smile of satisfaction. And Laura added,
                     "that she admired Benjamin Bailey's letter, and did not like either of the
                     others; and that she did not believe one word coming from Judge Bailey, or from
                     any one under his influence."</p>
                  <p>Deacon Sommers admitted that the hearsays had become badly mixed; and he
                     regretted that he had not visited Fallington before things got into such an
                     unpleasant state. In fact, Deacon Sommers himself, had begun to suspect that
                     all was not right with Judge Bailey. He had never known much of him, and for a
                     number of<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6367-00000101"/> years past almost nothing.
                     It had occurred to him that Judge Bailey and his family might have more than
                     one motive for deceiving the minister in Fallington, as well as the Cummings
                     family; that through them they might deceive others, and thus be enabled to
                     sustain themselves in society.</p>
                  <p>But the barrier between Laura and Benjamin was not yet to be removed; and there
                     was little prospect that it ever would be removed. Deacon Sommers thought it an
                     unpleasant matter to meddle with. No action was decided upon; and Laura saw
                     with regret, that results were still to await the uncertain events of time; and
                     that she could do little to hasten them. Years might pass away—her life might
                     pass away—ere the truth would come to light.</p>
                  <p>What strange barriers—what thin veils sometimes exist between the opinion we
                        <emph>do</emph> form and those we <emph>would</emph> form, if the veil which
                     hides some secret truths were drawn aside. Sometimes the barrier between is
                     innocent ignorance of some fact, and sometimes falsehood has placed it
                     there.</p>
                  <p>There was, indeed, a faint, lingering hope, returning now and then to Benjamin
                     and Laura, that the obstacles thrown between them would sometime and somehow be
                     explained away, <q>

                  <p>TIME passed on—time is a noted traveler in that direction—and Deacon Sommers
                     made a visit to Fallington; but circumstances so turned that Mrs. Sommers could
                     not accompany him. He thus lost the benefit of what a woman's visit could have
                     learned of fact and rumor.</p>
                  <p>It was common talk, however, that is to say, every confidential friend told her
                     confidential friend, under strict injunctions of secrecy, as she preferred not
                     to get the ill-will of the Bailey family—told of numerous scandalous things
                     that had lately come out against Judge Bailey and Jerusha Vroman; and also of
                     the heartless course which Mrs. Bailey, driven to defend him, had taken to
                     frighten Adeline into silence, and to destroy her credibility, should she speak
                     the truth. It was told, too, how Adeline, in a late severe sickness, in some
                     delirious moments, had said some strange things; at one time charging Judge
                     Bailey with a crime almost incredible; then how she blamed herself for having
                     helped Mrs. Bailey to conceal Jerusha's trouble.</p>
                  <p>And yet the very persons who whispered these things<pb n="202-203"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000102"/> the most, but the most privately, said among
                     themselves, "well, <emph>we</emph> don't wish to have their ill-will; they are
                     wealthy; they can do us favors, and should we openly appear to believe the
                     truth against them, they might pay us badly by starting falsehood against
                        <emph>us</emph> to <emph>our</emph> injury! We can not respect them, of
                     course, but we can treat them as if <emph>we were not supposed to know</emph>
                     how things are! We must look to our interest! We can stand it as long as the
                     minister and the deacons do." And the minister and the deacons thought it
                     wouldn't help matters to say anything. So Jared Bailey and his two or three
                     interested defenders <emph>seemed</emph> to keep possession of public respect
                     more than was a reality.</p>
                  <p>By continued favors, and also a bold cunning, in which Mrs. Bailey and Jerusha
                     were perfect masters, they secured either the good will or good opinion of Mrs.
                     Cummings, as well as of the minister's family; so that what Deacon Sommers
                     vaguely learned of facts, from other sources, they half-innocently smoothed
                     over. Indeed, it was a worldly failing of the Rev. Mr. Smoothwell, which he,
                     himself, however, mistook for one of his Christian virtues—that he was always
                     ready to counsel great forbearance and forgiveness in all special or individual
                     wrongs where even necessary notice was likely to interrupt the harmony of
                     subscribers to his salary; while he taught in a more distant sense, that on
                     account of Adam's transgression wrong-doers <emph>deserved</emph> no mercy.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Cummings, too, though she never submitted to wrongs against herself,
                     without fanning a spark into a blaze, felt a remarkable indifference to wrongs
                     against others. Hence in the latter cases, when it was for her interest to
                     cover up wrong, she, like the Rev. Mr. Smoothwell, believed it to be her
                     Christian virtues which led her to forbearance! In such cases it never occurred
                     to her that such a course could be carried far enough to encourage
                     evil-doing.</p>
                  <p>Deacon Sommers, however, had heard things against Judge Bailey in the nature of
                     several criminal assaults, which were of a character to corroborate the
                     statements in Mrs. Hartley's letter to Laura; and which alone rendered
                     Jerusha's statements in defense of Judge Bailey entirely inconsistent and
                     improbable; and hence tended to confirm the stories against herself. Also, to
                     the further astonishment of Deacon Sommers, all he could learn against
                     Benjamin, was traced to Jerusha and Judge Bailey's family. Mrs. Cummings
                     informed him that Adeline Wilderman declined to talk about other people's
                     quarrels. Deacon Sommers, therefore, learned nothing from the source to which
                     Mrs. Hartley's letter referred.</p>
                  <p>When Deacon Sommers returned home, he said that "he was obliged to admit that
                     he could hear nothing against Benjamin Bailey, except what had lately started
                     from Jared Bailey's family. He was also satisfied that Jared Bailey was
                        <emph>as dangerous a man as he dared to be!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>He regretted that he had no opportunity to see Benjamin Bailey, who, he
                     learned, had "gone West on private business," and would be gone several months
                     at least.</p>
                  <p>One evening after Laura had asked her father innumerable questions about his
                     late visit to Fallington, she sat carelessly picking the hem of her
                     handkerchief, when<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6367-00000103"/> her father
                     suggested that perhaps by spring Colonel Le Grange would be home, and she might
                     think better of him. "As for the scandal in Fallington against Jared Bailey,
                     and the unaccountable course his wife takes," added Deacon Sommers, "I fear it
                     will yet disgrace the whole Bailey name; for half the folks would never take
                     pains to inquire <emph>what</emph> Bailey, and never find out what
                        <emph>motive</emph> the Jared Bailey family had for turning over their own
                     scandal against Benjamin Bailey."</p>
                  <p>"Father," said Laura, after an unusual space of silence, "I want your
                     permission for me to write to Benjamin and tell what that Jerusha Vroman says
                     about him!"</p>
                  <p>"You may do that if you choose, after seeing Colonel Le Grange once more."</p>
                  <p>A smile of satisfaction lighted up Laura's countenance, as she replied:</p>
                  <p>"Then I shall be delighted to see the colonel just as soon as he can come!"</p>
                  <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>The day after Benjamin's experience with the two black-legs, the account of
                     which was closed in Chapter XVIII., he called according to appointment at the
                     custom house, where the collector was to give him instructions and introduce
                     him to the old detective Bedan, who in a short time entered the room. Bailey
                     and he stared a moment at each other in mutual surprise; and though they
                     instantly recognized each other, they manifested no recognition until the
                     collector, introducing them, had said:</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Bedan, this is Mr. Bailey, a gentleman who will assist you in looking
                     after smugglers."</p>
                  <p>"Well! well!" said Bedan, shaking hands with Bailey, "this either explains
                     things or else it doesn't! By Jove! I guess we've been practicing on each other
                     a little!"</p>
                  <p>"O, you've seen each other before this!" said the collector.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, Mr. Collector, on the cars, last Tuesday, I took Mr. Bailey for a
                     smuggler!"</p>
                  <p>"And I paid Mr. Bedan the same compliment!" retorted Bailey.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, ha! I see," smiled the collector.</p>
                  <p>"I believe Mr. Bedan is to find the <emph>boats,</emph>" added Bailey, "if I
                     conclude to smuggle a little whisky!"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, ha, ha! I <emph>was</emph> to find them, but <emph>now</emph> it will
                     belong to Mr. Bailey <emph>to find them,</emph> himself!"</p>
                  <p>The conversation now turned upon the duty which had best be assigned to Bailey.
                     It was finally decided that Bailey, being an entire stranger, should manage to
                     make the acquaintance of smugglers, and learn where and when they purchased
                     their goods, or smuggled them. He was also to send any information by
                     telegraph, in the secret cypher, understood by the collector, his deputy and
                     detectives. He was to avoid being seen much with other custom officers or about
                     the custom house.</p>
                  <p>Several weeks from the date of the above conversation Bailey arrived one
                     evening in the railroad depot with important news for the collector.</p>
                  <p>"Any news?" inquired the old detective, in a whisper, as he happened to meet
                     Bailey in the depot.</p>
                  <p>"Before forty-eight hours," replied the new detective, at low breath, "I can
                     tell the collector where and when to have a seizure made worth ten thousand
                     dollars!"</p>
                  <pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6367-00000104"/>
                  <p>"By Jove!" whispered Bedan, "twenty-five hundred dollars for your share; the
                     same for the collector, and five thousand for the government, wouldn't be bad
                     for you to begin on, Mr. Bailey!"</p>
                  <p>A few minutes later and the two detectives were having a private conversation
                     in the Exchange Hotel.</p>
                  <p>"What is the case you've just worked up?" asked Bedan.</p>
                  <p>"It is this: they are shipping flour and mill-feed to Buffalo from one of the
                     St. Catharines mills in Canada. They have entered at least a dozen boat loads,
                     free of duty, at the United States custom house, under a fraudulent entry, by
                     reporting the flour and mill-feed to have been manufactured from wheat raised
                     in Canada; when in fact the whole is dutiable, because made from American
                     wheat—a kind of violation you see of the present Reciprocity Treaty."</p>
                  <p>"Well, by Jove! Bailey, as many times as I've read up custom-house matters, I
                     never thought of the Canada mills making that dodge! But, Bailey, those mills
                     have Canada wheat and American, both, and how can we ever know which kind of
                     flour or shorts they ship into this country? It seems mixed up with one of
                     those queer laws which great statesmen sometimes make, as if on purpose to be
                     avoided or misunderstood!"</p>
                  <p>"But if I have read our custom-house laws rightly," said Bailey, "we are
                     justifiable under reasonable suspicion, to make a seizure, and then it rests
                     with the owner to prove the goods were properly reported for duties; and if
                     free of duty, why, then of course the oath that must be made to make a 'free
                     entry,' ought—whether it does or not—to cover the facts under which the free
                     entry is made; and if required, the importer ought to be able to prove the
                     facts otherwise than by his own oath, simply. In this case, however, I found
                     there had been no Canada wheat, or flour, or mill-feed, in the mill for six
                     weeks past. While I was there a vessel from Chicago was unloading wheat grown
                     in the Western States; and I tell you it was provoking enough to hear those
                     Canadians talk sympathy with a slaveholder's rebellion to ruin our country,
                     without our letting them get any more advantage than the Reciprocity Treaty
                     already allows them! I declare, it seems to me our country will serve them
                     right to annul that treaty."</p>
                  <p>"Yes," added Bedan, "and turn Fenian, too, till they stop giving aid and
                     comfort to Jeff. Davis."</p>
                  <p>Bedan now suggested to Bailey that he attempt to get the confidence of some of
                     the parties smuggling whisky across the river from Chippewa in Canada, at which
                     place there was a large distillery. It was his opinion there was a
                     newly-organized band of smugglers. "The inducement at this time," said Bedan,
                     "is about two dollars pergallon! enough to tempt some who pass for very
                     respectable people; though it is not considered quite so aristocratic to
                     smuggle whisky as it is silk or broadcloth; a thing which on any frontier,
                        <emph>custom,</emph> in spite of custom houses, seems to have 'sanctioned
                     and sanctified,' as Henry Clay once said of slavery! So you see, Bailey, we
                     must look out for respectable people as well as midnight desperadoes. If there
                     is a new company of smugglers, they,<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6367-00000105"/>
                     like the old ones, are sharp enough to have their secret spies watching customs
                     officers. They, of course, have men each side of the river, and a regular
                     system of talking signals for day and night. They can signal danger, and where
                     to land and when to land. We must have a new spy in their camp; you being a
                     stranger might safely act for awhile, and then on special occasions we can also
                     engage others."</p>
                  <p>Bailey's success in the detection of the smuggled flour and mill-feed made him
                     willing to risk a few adventures. He, therefore, favored the suggestion. And
                     Bedan went on to give a little of his own experience in that line of
                     detection.</p>
                  <p>"I got into one of the smuggler's secret organizations some two years ago,"
                     said Bedan, "where they operated down at the mouth of the river. But after I
                     had managed to get two or three smugglers arrested and their boats and goods
                     confiscated, they somehow got up a suspicion against me. An old fellow started
                     it by name of Chewbrick. He claimed that I was very much such a man as Jonah
                     was—the real cause of all the late troubles that befel their boating! which
                     fact, so to speak," said Bedan, with a smile, "was true! You see, in a moral
                     point of view"—here Bedan stopped to press a fresh supply of tobacco into his
                     mouth, as well as to consider how he was to finish his "moral point of
                     view"—"you see, Bailey, like a certain passage of Scripture, so in a moral
                     point of view it was with me, 'no man can serve two masters.' So I served the
                     government instead of the smuggling organization! Of course I was under the
                     necessity of being slightly <emph>hypocritical.</emph> We, of course, consider
                     our business right and honorable, but <emph>they didn't!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"Why, yes, Bedan, I justify a detective in this way. He acts as an officer of
                     the law—not as an individual. It is as right to detect and catch criminals as
                     it is to shut them up to punish them! It must be as right to catch a murderer
                     by deception as it is to hang him with a rope, and the same principle applies
                     to detecting lesser crimes!"</p>
                  <p>"Precisely so; but it would have amused you, Bailey, to have seen the
                     manifestation they gave me of their opinion of officers of our profession, when
                     one of their spies came with information that I was a custom-house detective,
                     betraying them! I was alone with them, on the bank of the river, about
                     midnight; alone with a half dozen smugglers, and the very worst men I ever
                     knew. They gave me a very brief, mock trial, and convicted me of being a
                     'deceptive and treacherous scoundrel!' 'It was their opinion,' said one of the
                     mildest of them, 'that I didn't deserve an honorable discharge from any decent
                     band of robbers! and much less from the fraternity of <emph>free
                        traders!</emph>' Another declared that 'it wasn't safe to give such a
                     villain a safe acquittal!'</p>
                  <p>"At the moment I started to escape from them, I had occasion to believe myself
                     in danger! And, by Jove! the discovery the next morning of two bullet holes in
                     the flying portion of my coat, confirmed me in the opinion that I hadn't taken
                     my departure any <emph>too</emph> quick; and that in all probability, I had
                     lost their confidence! And, furthermore, Bailey, on that occasion I don't think
                     they were shooting to frighten me! There was too much<pb n="210-211"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000106"/> meaning in those bullet holes! For several days
                     afterwards I also felt a sore sensation, putting me in recollection of heavy
                     cow-hide boots which had come before the shooting, into forcible contact with
                     indiscriminate portions, so to speak, of my mortal body!"</p>
                  <p>After some further conversation our two detectives separated.</p>
                  <p>Four days later the canal-boat, loaded with shorts and flour in Canada, was
                     towed out of the Welland Canal; and on reaching Buffalo the expected fraudulent
                     entry was made, when the boat and cargo were seized by the officers of
                     customs.</p>
                  <p>Benjamin afterwards received a letter from his friend, Mr. Baldwin, in
                     Washington, congratulating him on being the first to detect that class of
                     unlawful entries. The government thereafter took extra precautions to collect
                     duties in similar cases, and many thousand dollars was saved to the country
                     before the Reciprocity Treaty was, in 1866, finally abrogated by the United
                     States.</p>
                  <p>Benjamin next attempted to gain the confidence of some of the whisky smugglers.
                     For this purpose he took lodgings at a tavern in Chippewa. The boisterous
                     nonsense, the profane and obscene levity of assembled drinkers, smokers and
                     topers, in the bar-room, on the first evening, sickened him of his undertaking.
                     His mind reverted to his country home, and to his sister's cautious warnings,
                     and his own resolution on that afternoon when the telegram announced his
                     appointment.</p>
                  <p>From these reflections, however, he was soon startled by hearing the landlord
                     address a man with a gray beard by a name which he had heard his mother speak
                     of in connection with his grandfather Bailey's will!</p>
                  <p>"I say, Figsley," said the landlord, "take my advice to-night, and go home
                     sober!"</p>
                  <p>"Whose business—Mr. Tibbles, is <emph>my</emph> business?—so long—as I've no
                     wife—and—no <emph>children</emph> as I know of—I think, Tibbles—I could
                     stand—about one—glass more!" bewildered out the man addressed as Figsley.</p>
                  <p>"I'll be d—d if you get another glass <emph>here</emph> to-night," replied
                     landlord Tibbles. For landlord Tibbles feared that too much drinking (his idea
                     of too much) might make his bar-room unmanageable.</p>
                  <p>"Say, Tibbles, say," hiccoughed Figsley, with a wicked grin, "do you—you
                     think—you would—ever be—damned, wholly—on my account—eh?"</p>
                  <p>"If not, I <emph>ought</emph> to be, for selling liquor to such men as
                     you!"</p>
                  <p>"I'm glad to hear you—say so!" retorted Figsley. "It's a good confession—worthy
                     to be—said before any—priest of your parsuasion!"</p>
                  <p>"At any rate, Mr. Figsley, you can't have any more <emph>here,</emph>
                     to-night."</p>
                  <p>"Well, I'm—dev'lish glad—to hear you say so—to a man of my education—Mr.
                     Tibbles—glad you've reformed. I think all—the more of you for it—<emph>I</emph>
                     do, Mr. Tibbles!"</p>
                  <p>So saying, he took a huge quid of tobacco from his mouth, crammed another in,
                     and staggered out of the bar-room into the street.</p>
                  <p>Here a man, apparently a day laborer, with old age<pb n="212-213"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000107"/> hurrying upon him, approached the bar. His poor
                     but well-patched clothes and clean shirt collar, bespoke the efforts of a
                     patient and enduring wife. He called for a glass of whisky. Landlord Tibbles
                     placed the decanter and tumbler before him. The poor old man filled the glass
                     to the brim; then placing one hand on the handle of the water-pitcher, he
                     raised the whisky with the other to his lips; then he hesitated, and leaning
                     over the bar whispered something to the landlord.</p>
                  <p>"I've told you times enough," replied the landlord, with the most blasphemous
                     oaths and curses, "that I don't <emph>trust</emph> my liquor till no Saturday
                     night!"</p>
                  <p>The old man still hesitated, when landlord Tibbles, with a new set of oaths,
                     ordered him to let the liquor alone, and set down the glass. But the poor slave
                     to drink making no reply, turned the coveted fluid down his throat and slowly
                     went from the bar, bearing both shame and abuse.</p>
                  <p>One of the company remarked to another, sitting near Benjamin:</p>
                  <p>"If Pat was as big a rascal as old Figsley, he could get money to pay for his
                     whisky without coming down to that!"</p>
                  <p>"Did you ever hear how old Figsley gets his money?" asked another.</p>
                  <p>"I know what I think about it," replied the first.</p>
                  <p>"It's my opinion he and that Vroman on the other side of the river, are doing a
                     mighty good business smuggling!"</p>
                  <p>"Figsley! Figsley!" thought Benjamin, at the first mention of that name.
                     "Possibly this is the Figsley who was a witness to my grandfather's will. But
                     his surprise was still greater when Vroman, another name to the will, was
                     spoken of with Figsley. If such men, he pondered, were witnesses, no wonder
                     that Judge Bailey was suspected of something wrong in a will so contrary to my
                     grandfather's known wishes. Who knows what time may not develop? And what a
                     fool I have been that I have so often and so easily yielded to opposing
                     circumstances. Is this the way the fight the battle of life? No!" said Benjamin
                     Bailey, to himself, almost audibly, "and if I let Judge Bailey deprive me of
                     Laura Sommers, and do not devise ways to aid time in bringing out the truth, I
                     shall <emph>deserve</emph> to lose her!" And he resolved to know more of these
                     two men. If Judge Bailey's secret history were in part known to them, perhaps
                     here was an opportunity to detect something more than smuggling—something
                     tangible for himself, and convincing for the ear of Mr. Sommers.</p>
                  <p>But Benjamin could not penetrate yet that hidden future, so dark to mortal
                     eyes; and so he little dreamed how much was soon to be lighted up as that
                     future rolled into the present—lighted from what seemed to be accidental sparks
                     on the tinder of time's events.</p>
                  <p>O, how searchingly then will their "sins find them out" and "bring sudden
                     destruction" upon them!</p>

                  <p>WHILE Benjamin Bailey is endeavoring to perform the duties of his office at the
                     various points on the frontier, and is especially gaining the confidence of one
                     smuggler from whom he hopes to learn important secrets for himself, as well as
                     the government, let us notice an adventure of Miss Laura Sommers among the
                     reminiscences of the custom house.</p>
                  <p>A new officer of customs, Mr. Seth Dobbins, had just been appointed. His duties
                     were with passengers and their baggage arriving in the cars from Canada upon
                     the Great Western Railway, which runs across the celebrated suspension bridge
                     into the United States, terminating at the depots of the Erie and the New York
                     Central Railroads, where the passengers at this time changed cars for the East
                     or South. In the hurry of changing cars a better opportunity for smuggling
                     goods, concealed under the clothing worn by ladies, had been afforded here,
                     than by walking or riding across the lower floor of this peculiar transit from
                     one nation to another. But now new orders had been given by the government. All
                     women suspected of having ing any dutiable goods concealed among their wearing
                     apparel, were to be required by the officials to report to an inspectress. To
                     create a suspicion of smuggling, it was considered enough if an official was
                     informed that the American ladies had been seen to enter Canadian stores.
                     Sometimes the very clerks who had sold the goods were secretly engaged and paid
                     by detectives as informers!</p>
                  <p>One day several highly respectable ladies, among whom was Miss Laura Sommers,
                     were seen to cross the suspension bridge on foot and to take the cars in
                     Canada. Our old detective, Bedan, took that same train, got off at the same
                     station. Less than two hours afterwards the collector of customs received a
                     telegram in secret cypher, which meant a description of these ladies. Then
                     immediately Dobbins, the new officer, received special orders. When the next
                     train arrived, these ladies and a large number of others, were surprised when
                     officer Dobbins requested them to report to the lady officer, whose room he
                     pointed out.</p>
                  <p>Now it happened fortunately for Laura's friends, who were with her, that
                     through caution, they had arranged to have their goods taken charge of by
                     friends living upon the Canada side of the river till some subsequent day, when
                     they would call upon these friends, be seen to enter no store, secrete their
                     goods upon their persons, and return, like nine-tenths of all who cross the
                     bridge, without justifiable suspicion of smuggling.</p>
                  <p>But Miss Sommers had been less cautious. She did not leave her new purchases
                     upon the Canada side in the care of friends for a future visit. Like hundreds
                        of<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6367-00000109"/> others she more than half
                     believed that she had a clear title to what she bought "for her own use and
                     with her own money, and not to sell again." She had purchased a merino dress
                     pattern and some velvet for trimmings, which, for reasons that she afterwards
                     expressed to officer Dobbins she had concealed under the mantilla she that day
                     wore. There had been little prospect of any lady escaping; for Dobbins believed
                     that with silk at half price, no lady would hesitate to buy at least ribbon
                     enough for bonnet strings. After having taken his oath of office to be faithful
                     in collecting the duties, he acted upon principle, and, being a new officer,
                     counted nothing too small to collect; till, at last, he was blamed by the
                     collector for annoying the public by obeying orders too strictly.</p>
                  <p>Of course, then, Miss Sommers and her lady friends were required to report to
                     the inspectress. Laura's friends (thanks to their caution) passed innocent! but
                     her own purchases were found. And a few minutes later the merino dress pattern
                     and the velvet trimmings were delivered into the hands of officer Dobbins.</p>
                  <p>Miss Sommers then inquired if she could have the goods by paying the duty upon
                     them.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Dobbins hesitated; Miss Sommers was beautiful; Mr. Dobbins had already
                     thought so, and was embarrassed. He remembered his oath, and yet he wanted to
                     please the fair girl before him, and he said:</p>
                  <p>"Madam, I regret very much—in this case—that I am obliged to deprive you of
                     these goods. Indeed, I would be glad to pass them unnoticed, if it were not for
                     my oath of office."</p>
                  <p>"I beg your pardon, sir, but I think it is generally believed by the best of
                     our citizens that a custom-house officer has no right to take articles
                     purchased for one's own use. They think it ought not to be considered
                     smuggling, sir."</p>
                  <p>"I suppose, Madam, that the concealment of the goods would be evidence of
                     intention—to—smuggle." Then Dobbins was angry at himself for the way he had
                     said this! He might have used some milder word than smuggle! So he added: "I'm
                     sorry, but I suppose that that is why the government does not allow me to give
                     back the goods and take the duty in such cases."</p>
                  <p>"No, sir, I beg your pardon again; the concealment does not, in my case, prove
                     that I intended to smuggle—only I was afraid you officers would be so
                     unreasonable as to charge me duty when I knew that a great many smart people
                     say we have a right to buy such little things for our own use on the frontier
                     here."</p>
                  <p>"Your reply," said Mr. Dobbins, smiling, "is a very good one. Concealment
                     because <emph>officers might be unreasonable</emph> is another motive, I admit.
                     I presume, however, that you do not reside here, or, are not acquainted with
                     the rules of the custom house."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir," said Miss Sommers, smiling at the confession she was about to make,
                     "I do reside very near here; and I am acquainted with the custom of people
                     getting a great many little articles in Canada without paying duty!"</p>
                  <p>"You turn my reasoning very well, Madam; and yet,"<pb n="218-219"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000110"/> said the new officer, "it seems strange to me
                     that so many people think it right to—to do so."</p>
                  <p>"Some of you officers call everything smuggling; but we don't! When we buy a
                     yard of ribbon or a dress, we think it is ours; and I'm sure it is no
                        <emph>moral</emph> wrong!"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Dobbins had never before seen Miss Sommers, to his knowledge, but he began
                     to be certain that he admired her. And his conviction seemed to grow stronger
                     that she was beautiful! What she had said, and how she had said it, pleased
                     him. So he said with as much suavity as he could:</p>
                  <p>"Then you do not think it wrong for ladies to—avoid the laws about duties, do
                     you?"</p>
                  <p>"Wrong?" repeated Miss Sommers, in a low voice, and as if to gain a moment's
                     thought before replying, "No, not wrong—in one sense." And then addressing her
                     friend, Mrs. Fairfield, who had been making some inquiries of the inspectress,
                     she added as a further answer to Mr. Dobbins moral question in reference to
                     smuggling: "Do <emph>you</emph> think, Mrs. Fairfield, that ladies, who are not
                     allowed to vote on any law whatever, are bound to believe in high tariff, and
                     in <emph>prohibiting</emph> trade, because politicians do?"</p>
                  <p>"No, Miss Sommers, I do not," said Mrs. Fairfield; "neither do I believe that
                     because a custom-house official is legally right, that we are therefore morally
                     wrong!" Mrs. Fairfield, however, was very agreeable in her manner of
                     expression.</p>
                  <p>And officer Dobbins smiled while he remarked, "that he supposed everybody ought
                     to obey the laws."</p>
                  <p>"I think," rejoined Miss Sommers, "that it is worse to make some laws than it
                     is to break them. I know that my father was proud of the fact that he used to
                     violate the Fugitive Slave Law. He would keep slaves over night, and give them
                     something to eat, and help them to get into Canada, away from the
                     slave-catchers, in spite of the law!"</p>
                  <p>"But this young lady was not bringing goods here for sale," said Mrs.
                     Fairfield.</p>
                  <p>"Are you going to be so strict, sir, as to keep my dress pattern?" asked
                     Laura.</p>
                  <p>"I am obliged to do so, Madam, by orders in such cases, from
                     head-quarters."</p>
                  <p>"Will you be kind enough, sir, to tell me where is head-quarters? I'll go and
                     see if I have done such a great wrong."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Dobbins very politely referred her to the office of the collector, but said
                     that "even <emph>he</emph> had no right to restore the goods, because the law
                     required them to be sold at auction by the government."</p>
                  <p>"I have been told," replied Miss Sommers, "that the officers get one-quarter of
                     all the goods they seize."</p>
                  <p>Although she endeavored to soften the remark with a good-natured smile, yet Mr.
                     Dobbins thought he knew that her intelligent blue eyes looked as if she
                     intended to hint that officials for that reason were over-strict. That she did
                     so intend her remarks I have no doubt. Mr. Dobbins was embarrassed; and before
                     he could reply Mrs. Fairfield had told Laura that the collector also gets
                     one-quarter of the proceeds from seizures; and that one-half<pb n="220-221"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000111"/> half goes to the government; she thought
                     everybody on the frontier knew that. Then the ladies walked away from the
                     presence of Mr. Dobbins and the inspectress. But as they turned to go Mr.
                     Dobbins was certain that Miss Sommers had replied to Mrs. Fairfield, that "if
                     the officers were all interested then her dress pattern had gone to the
                     dogs!"</p>
                  <p>The first moment that Mr. Dobbins found himself alone, he had a little talk to
                     himself. "Just my kind of luck, exactly," said he, "falling in love at first
                     sight, with a stranger. Confusion! a slight aberration of mind, already! Of
                     course a '<emph>stranger' if at 'first' sight!</emph> They say that love is
                     blind; and I should say that I should say so—under existing circumstances. Mr.
                     Seth Dobbins, allow me to say that you—that is, I—haven't any chance at all. I
                     don't think, Seth, that she would care even to make my acquaintance. Her dress
                     pattern, with all its little fixings, which she bought with her own money,
                     etc., is in my custody—your custody, Mr. Dobbins—and the collector's—and it is
                     her expressed opinion that it has gone to the dogs!"</p>
                  <p>"Let me see! I treated her politely, and she smiled and acted good-natured, and
                     so did I; and 'a faint heart never won a fair lady!' Her name is Miss
                     Sommers—so the lady called her—and she lives near here; and Seth Dobbins must
                     make some opportunity to make her acquaintance!"</p>
                  <p>"What <emph>could</emph> she have meant," said Dobbins to himself, the next
                     day, "by saying that goods in the hands of officials had 'gone to the dogs?'
                     Did she mean it as a hopeless or a sarcastic expression?" Then, too, the
                     expression was not a very refined one; but he told himself that very well bred
                     ladies—and very amiable ladies, too, under perplexing circumstances, did
                     sometimes unfortunately, use unchoice expressions, so that, as Mr. Dobbins was
                     charitable enough to suppose, they could not be charged with the vanity of
                     thinking themselves perfection. So it troubled him most to decide what was her
                     meaning. Finding that Mr. Riggs, one of his brother officials, was well
                     acquainted with Deacon Sommers' family, Mr. Dobbins ventured to ask him his
                     opinion on the ambiguous expression.</p>
                  <p>But Mr. Riggs preferred to let the attractive Miss Sommers manage her own case;
                     consequently he assured his bachelor friend that it was impossible to say which
                     meaning she had intended; as it was impossible for him to understand what
                     impressions they may have made upon each other under the peculiar circumstances
                     of the introduction.</p>
                  <p>If his friend Dobbins were "in love <foreign xml:lang="LAT">de
                     facto</foreign>"—Mr. Riggs had heard the village lawyer say <foreign
                        xml:lang="LAT">de facto</foreign>—then in his opinion, all that Dobbins
                     could do, was "to manage his case judiciously!" Perhaps it would be best "to
                     wait future developments and treat the symptoms homeopathically, that is
                     specifically as they come up." "By all means," said Mr. Riggs, with emphasis,
                     "until you understand this case act homeopathically. Don't make things worse
                     before you try to make them better. Don't add more difficulties, and thus
                     amputate what little prospects you may now have."</p>
                  <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6367-00000112"/>
                  <p>As Riggs used the word <hi rend="i"/>amputate, Dobbins smiled; and then Riggs
                     did the same, and turned his high-sounding nonsense into something more like
                     practicable advice. "Dobbins," said he, "get some middle-aged lady friend to
                     find out and tell you what Miss Sommers thinks of that new officer, Mr. Seth
                     Dobbins. Then you can tell what to do next."</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Seth Dobbins," said Dobbins, addressing himself, after leaving the
                     presence of Mr. Riggs, "in the first place, you—I—had better let this affair
                     rest till this seizure matter is a little out of her thoughts." And then the
                     ambiguous expression recurred to him again—whether Miss Sommers had meant to
                     intimate that customs officers were like a set of watch-dogs. But then he knew
                     that she had made a fruitless application to the collector; and the thought now
                     came to him that this would prevent her from further blaming himself. Dobbins
                     thought over the matter a great many times during the weeks that followed
                     preceding the time when the dress goods would be sold at the auction sales. He
                     dreamed that everything would finally turn in his favor; that he would see Miss
                     Sommers at the auction sales, and that he would look so well in the eyes of
                     Miss Sommers that a very romantic courtship would follow—and then a
                     wedding.</p>
                  <p>When Laura Sommers left the collector's office, without recovering her dress
                     goods, she began to believe that the new officer, who had seized them, had,
                     after all, tried to be very agreeable. And I have no doubt that she thought of
                     two circumstances: how easy the conversation had been prolonged with the new
                     officer; how short and unexplained was everything with the collector. The
                     collector was a man of years, and thought only of the law and the facts; while
                     Mr. Dobbins had before himself prospective matrimony.</p>
                  <p>Not long after the seizure of the dress pattern, Laura Sommers noticed among
                     the items of seized goods advertised in the village newspaper, to be sold at
                     auction, in the custom house, "<hi rend="i"/>Ten yards of purple, merino dress
                     goods," and "<hi rend="i"/>Twenty-four yards velvet trimming;" and she resolved
                     to be the purchaser of her lost dress goods.</p>
                  <p>The day for custom-house sales at last came round. It was a beautiful morning,
                     and before 10 A. M., the hour for the sales to begin, there were a good number
                     of ladies and gentlemen waiting in the sales-room of the United States custom
                     house; a large, square, stone building on the north side of the railroad, and
                     within fifteen feet of the passing trains just before they enter upon the great
                     suspension bridge. If you ever passed this bridge during a visit at Niagara
                     Falls, you have noticed the building.</p>
                  <p>Among the items to be sold were three dress patterns of Irish poplin and
                        <emph>six bottles of brandy;</emph> all of which had been found evenly
                     divided on the persons of three genteel and respectable ladies, who had come
                     across from Canada in one of the fine carriages attainable by the pleasure
                     travel of that locality. These ladies, accompanied by an elderly gentleman, all
                     having a wealthy and aristocratic appearance, had passed officer Riggs, and
                     becoming the unfortunate objects of his suspicion, he had directed the ladies
                     to report to the inspectress; when the said articles were found and seized.</p>
                  <pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6367-00000113"/>
                  <p>Mr. Riggs was, therefore, early at the place of sale, feeling a patriotic
                     interest in seeing the poplins and the brandy sold at a good price, in order
                     that the <emph>government share</emph> of the proceeds would aid in reducing
                     taxation. Of course it was pure patriotism, for the government share was just
                     double that of officer Riggs! At least this is as plain as the patriotism of
                     some who at this time were enlisting in the army as privates, with the
                     understanding that they were to be promoted to captains and brigadiers! O, how
                     we overpraise men in high positions, sometimes, who are kept patriotic and
                     faithful because it is their stock in trade! while oftentimes the poor,
                     ill-paid and self-sacrificing private soldier has been censured and perhaps
                     dishonorably discharged, because he could not submissively bear all the
                     exactions and manners of (in many cases) <emph>inferior</emph> superiors!</p>
                  <p>The small auction-room was crowded; some of the gentlemen, therefore, were
                     standing in an adjoining apartment, among whom were Benjamin Bailey, Bedan,
                     Dobbins, Riggs, and other officials. Mr. Dobbins, however, was occasionally
                     going about the room where he hoped Miss Sommers would be present to observe
                     him. Benjamin Bailey, at a proper time and place, would have been overjoyed to
                     meet Laura Sommers. But now he desired not to be recognized by any of the
                     Sommers family—not till he should be permitted to vindicate himself to Mr.
                     William Sommers against his still unknown slanderers, did he desire to meet her
                     from whom he would have to part so sadly.</p>
                  <p>Most of the goods had been sold, when the auctioneer at last put up the
                     poplins, one dress pattern at a time. Riggs, who had made the seizure, started
                     the bidding at fifty cents per yard. At first the bidding against him was very
                     light, and to all appearance the poplins were likely to go at less than half
                     their value. But the auctioneer was a true officer of the government; and after
                     having raised his hammer as if for the "last warning," he seemed suddenly to
                     relinquish the idea of striking it off at so low a bid, and after a moment's
                     pause he said, with a forced seriousness of tone and manner:</p>
                  <p>"Ladies and gentlemen, I am astonished that you will look calmly on such a
                     scene as this! This is not merely sacrificing <emph>Irish</emph> poplin, if
                     these goods are to be sold at half their value. They are the property of the
                     United States—of your own government! Will you see its property wasted or
                     thrown away for half price at an auctions? At this rate, how shall we ever pay
                     our national debt of twenty-five hundred millions of dollars? And yet you who
                     pretended to be patriotic citizens, and are even willing to send all your poor
                     relations into the army to bleed and die for your country—you seem contriving
                     not to bid against each other! <emph>Seventy-five cents</emph> only is bid! and
                     is there no lady here who will help run up this dress pattern, which is going
                     at <emph>only</emph> seventy-five—<emph>seventy-five cents?</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"Eighty cents," said a new bidder.</p>
                  <p>"Eighty cents," repeated the auctioneer, "eighty—going at eighty; who'll give
                     the dollar? worth three times the money, and going at eighty cents."</p>
                  <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6367-00000114"/>
                  <p>"Eighty-five, is bid—ninety—going at one dollar, one dollar, one dollar."</p>
                  <p>And the auctioneer went on crying off the bids; at which monotonous business we
                     will leave him a moment to notice a sample of the talk among the
                     by-standers.</p>
                  <p>Said one lady in an undertone: "Don't bid so fast—not so quick—make the
                     auctioneer think your bid is the last one!"</p>
                  <p>"Why, yes," replied the lady, "if you seem willing to pay a high price, the
                     others will stop bidding against you."</p>
                  <p>Another young lady whispered:</p>
                  <p>"Mother, don't bid till they've sold a few dress patterns; then there will not
                     be so many buyers!"</p>
                  <p>"You heard," said another, "how that new officer, Mr. Dobbins, seized two
                     merino dresses, three poplins, and ever so many things from Laura Sommers, did
                     you not?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I know all about it; she told me herself. Only it wasn't ever so many
                     things, at all; she only had one dress pattern and a little trimming; nothing
                     more."</p>
                  <p>"O, my! I heard she had more than she could carry."</p>
                  <p>"And you believed it?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, I didn't stop to think!"</p>
                  <p>"I guess if everybody did stop, once in a while, to think, we shouldn't hear so
                     many big stories."</p>
                  <p>"Well, she did have the Irish poplins, of course, for they are selling one of
                     them now!"</p>
                  <p>"Does that prove that Laura Sommers ever had them?" was the argumentative
                     reply.</p>
                  <p>"Why! here is Laura, now," said the other.</p>
                  <p>"Of course, I am," said Laura, smiling, "and I'm here to have my merino dress
                     pattern; and father says, if I wish to, I may buy a dress here for Sophia. You
                     know that new officer, Mr. Dobbins, took one of her's, that she was bringing
                     from Canada, awhile ago; and she is a poor girl, too, and she plays the organ
                     so nicely for our church, you know."</p>

                     with Nervous Mental Inquiries—Excitement at the Auction—The Mysterious
                     Bidder.</head>
                  <p>THE auctioneer was now offering the last of the poplin dress patterns.</p>
                  <p>"Eighty cents," bid Mr. Dobbins.</p>
                  <p>"Eighty cents! eighty, going at eighty cents—and <emph>is</emph> it possible,
                     ladies, that you will allow these customs-house officers after taking so many
                     things away from your friends—allow such fellows to bid off these fine, Irish
                     poplin dresses at half the real value?" Here the auctioneer, who was himself an
                     official, smiled at his own allusions; and everybody else smiled, while he
                     continued: "Will you—can you allow all this, after taking the trouble that so
                     many of you have to bring such things from a foreign country, across this
                     romantic river? Possible that these goods are going at only eighty cents per
                     yard? at eighty, eighty, eighty—at eighty cents!"</p>
                  <p>"Eighty-five," said a stranger.</p>
                  <p>"Ninety," spoke the low voice of a lady, which Mr. Dobbins did not
                     recognize.</p>
                  <p>"Ninety-five," offered Mr. Dobbins, looking through the open doorway from the
                     adjoining room.</p>
                  <p>"One dollar," spoke the voice which Mr. Dobbins had just overbidden.</p>
                  <p>"One dollar, one dollar; the gentleman's bid of ninety-five is lost, by a
                     fairer bidder, and shall I hear any more than one dollar?" said the auctioneer,
                     turning his eyes from the last bidder towards officer Dobbins.</p>
                  <p>Thus involuntarily directed, the two bidders also met each other's gaze. Then
                     Mr. Dobbins knew that he had been bidding against Miss Sommers. He bowed with
                     all the grace that embarrassment permitted. And Miss Sommers, whatever she
                     might have done had the opportunity for recognition been less sudden—did
                     sufficiently recognize officer Dobbins to excuse him for the bow that he gave
                     her. He was certain, too, that she bowed in return; but it was so slight that
                     it worried him. It was in vain that the auctioneer cried on for another bid.
                     Mr. Seth Dobbins had ceased bidding. Miss Sommers had again turned his brain
                     into nervous mental inquiries! Did she yet blame him for the scizure? Had she
                     now recognized him because he had performed that unpleasant duty so politely
                     and kindly? Or, might it not be, after all, that she had glanced at him just an
                     instant, to see if his bids had been made against her, knowingly, instead of
                     her having a desire to give him a polite recognition? And then it flashed over
                     Mr. Dobbins—what if she were to get the impression that he had bowed only to
                     recognize her in connection with the unpleasant scizure of her dress pattern.
                     If she did not think so at the moment, she would on reflection. And why not?
                     Had he not had the ungallantry to bid against her? True, he had not known that
                     it was she, but to her it may have seemed, to would seem, that he did know. And
                     this worried him.</p>
                  <pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6367-00000116"/>
                  <p>Then as to the matter of a lady buying a few dollars' worth in Canada, as Miss
                     Sommers had done, he had learned since, that no one in the best society of the
                     village thought any harm of it; and he was sure that he wanted Miss Sommers to
                     think now that he, too, thought no less of her for it.</p>
                  <p>It was no mistake of Laura's that she thought that she distinguished a deep
                     blush of embarrassment on all of the unwhiskered portion of Mr. Dobbins' face;
                     and afterwards the more she thought of it the plainer she knew that she had
                     noticed a quiver of his mustache. This impression, however, may have come
                     through her imagination.</p>
                  <p>The auctioneer got no other bid, and the poplin dress pattern was struck off at
                     what was, in those war tin not more than half its value.</p>
                  <p>"There," whispered Laura to Miss Percival, "I've got a nicer bargain for Sophia
                     than either of us made in Canada."</p>
                  <p>"And a much <emph>safer</emph> bargain," added Miss Percival, with a smile.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," responded Laura, "it was too bad for <emph>us</emph> to lose our
                     Canadian goods when <emph>the rest of you</emph> always have such good luck!"
                     And then before Miss Percival could put in a rejoinder, Laura proceeded to
                     declare that she did not like custom-house officials; especially the one who
                     had just bid against her; but she would just like "to know if that Mr. Dobbins
                     did that on purpose!"</p>
                  <p>"O, you don't like him," whispered Miss Percival, very perceptibly enlarging
                     the orbs of her lovely blue eyes, "but you <emph>would</emph> just like to know
                     what he is thinking of you!"</p>
                  <p>"No, not that; but I was just thinking—"</p>
                  <p>"O, no, you don't like him," interrupted Miss Percival, "but you
                        <emph>would</emph> just like to know if he stopped bidding the moment he saw
                     it was you, and made that interesting bow—on purpose!"</p>
                  <p>"Are you afraid that he is going to like me?" retorted Laura,
                     good-naturedly.</p>
                  <p>"I? I never spoke with him. But I hear that he is the best one among the whole
                     dozen officials in this place."</p>
                  <p>"Best one? how? best fellow, or best officer?"</p>
                  <p>"The best <foreign xml:lang="FRA">beau,</foreign> I mean. What else
                        <emph>should</emph> I mean?"</p>
                  <p>"But, Clara Percival, you can't think he wants to be <emph>my</emph>
                     beau—seizing my dress pattern—bidding against me.</p>
                  <p>Doesn't it look as though some unlucky star had fated us to an unfavorable
                     acquaintance?"</p>
                  <p>"'Truth is stranger than fiction,'" said Miss Percival.</p>
                  <p>And Miss Percival might have added that gossip is stranger than either. Mr.
                     Dobbins was a new officer, and whatever is new gets into the mouth of gossip.
                     Gossip had said that Mr. Dobbins wouldn't be thought much of here, if he
                     persisted in being so strict about small purchases; and then gossip
                     contradicted itself, and declared that Dobbins allowed the policemen to smuggle
                     all the whisky they wanted—and the Justice, too! and that Dobbins permitted
                     some ladies to pass him that were "completely loaded down" with smuggled goods.
                     Mrs. Limberlingual, whose tongue sometimes runs faster than her thoughts,
                     declared that "she had heard, with her own<pb n="232-233"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000117"/> lips, that Sophia What's-er-name, had told
                     somebody, that Mr. Dobbins, or Doublebins, or some of the officers,
                        <emph>didn't pretend to suspect some folks!</emph>" Mrs. Listenviel, on the
                     contrary, had asserted "that there was no truth in this report—else she would
                     have heard of it—and consequently that Sophia had said nothing of the kind; and
                     that it wasn't true if she had!"</p>
                  <p>There is no place in the world like a small village for gossip to develop
                     itself into <emph>perfect</emph> imperfection. It is only necessary that
                     something either does happen or does not happen, when straightway somebody
                     feels inspired to see that said something has a relation to other possible or
                     impossible events. Consequently gossip said everything about everything, but on
                     account of gossip's known weakness in such matters, neither his truths nor his
                     falsehoods seemed to injure any one; probably because the one was known seldom
                     to be separate from the other!</p>
                  <p>It had been reported very confidentially among a very few that Mr. Dobbins was
                     holding a correspondence with Miss Sommers, and that they were engaged to be
                     married, and that Mrs. Fairfield had said so. Mrs. Fairfield, however, had been
                     inquired of, and she affirmed that she had never said so, and never had heard
                     such an intimation. All she remembered saying was, that at the time of the
                     seizure of Laura's dress, she had noticed their "<emph>holding quite a
                        conversation!</emph>" or in reference to that conversation she may have said
                     that "they were quite engaged." She remembered saying that Laura Sommers was a
                     sensible and high-minded girl; and no doubt respected officer Dobbins for the
                     honesty which made him do his duty; and perhaps admired his pleasant way of
                     doing an <emph>unpleasant</emph> duty.</p>
                  <p>But we must now return to the auctioneer, for he is announcing that he "will
                     sell 'a purple merino dress pattern,' which was imported into this country from
                     across the river, he presumed, by a lady of taste; and consequently everybody
                     present could rely upon the goods being of the very best style and quality. He
                     presumed that the lady must have forgotten to report it to the custom
                     house!"</p>
                  <p>By this time the auctioneer had displayed the goods, and it had been whispered
                     among the by-standers that it was the dress pattern which Miss Sommers had
                     purchased in Canada. The auctioneer called for a bid, but for some reason there
                     was a reluctance to bidding. It was usual for the seizing officer to start the
                     bidding, and see that the goods were sold as high as possible. But in this case
                     officer Dobbins had told himself that he should do nothing of the kind. Miss
                     Sommers he now knew was present, and he was certain that he would not interfere
                     with her dress pattern any further.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Dobbins was in love, and he knew that he was in love; and under the
                     unfavorable circumstances he feared that he was hopelessly in love. And again
                     he was troubled with mental questions; hadn't he better write a short note to
                     Miss Sommers to apologize? And what could he lose by asking at the same time
                     the pleasure of making her acquaintance?</p>
                  <p>But Mr. Dobbins realized the fact that it was easier to ask himself questions
                     than to give himself satisfactory answers.</p>
                  <pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6367-00000118"/>
                  <p>"How much is offered?" cried the auctioneer.</p>
                  <p>"Fifty cents a yard," said Miss Sommers.</p>
                  <p>"It is Miss Sommers, the lady who lost the goods, that just made the bid," said
                     Mr. Dobbins, as he passed officer Riggs and detective Bailey, "and out of
                     compliment I hope the villagers will not bid against her."</p>
                  <p>It was well for the present comfort of both, that Mr. Seth Dobbins and Mr.
                     Benjamin Bailey did not know that they were rival lovers!</p>
                  <p>"Is it possible," cried the auctioneer, observing the reluctance to bid, "that
                     you will see this fine merino sold at one-quarter its value? Where is your
                     patriotism thus to stand by and see your country's property sacrificed?"</p>
                  <p>Nobody seemed inclined to bid against Miss Sommers. This was, indeed, a
                     compliment to Laura Sommers among her neighbors. The man of mental inquiries
                     knew it, and asked himself if she would ever forgive him, and then if she would
                     love him. He must wait and see! Haste would surely dash away his little
                     hopes.</p>
                  <p>But how about the other? the one who once knew that Laura loved him! He, too,
                     was waiting. He was waiting for truth to reveal the assassins of his hopes. He
                     knew that the innocent were often destroyed by the guilty. For himself he was
                     sad and almost hopeless. Perhaps it were well if Laura, so long as she were
                     forbidden to see him, believed him unworthy. He knew that she was then in the
                     auction room and his heart beat in gladness for her over the pleasure she must
                     feel to know that her village neighbors so evidently intended the compliment in
                     refusing to bid against her on this occasion.</p>
                  <p>The auctioneer had raised his hammer for the "last call," when a man of
                     mysterious character—mysterious because that which <emph>was</emph> known
                     indicated to the villagers that there was much more that <emph>should be
                        known</emph>—approached and examined the merino. While he was turning the
                     cloth over and over and tearing the edge to try its strength, a voice
                     inquired:</p>
                  <p>"What does John Vroman want of such a dress—a man that abuses his wife as he
                     does?"</p>
                  <p>"May be he's going to hire his daughter Jerusha to come home again," said
                     another.</p>
                  <p>"Can't dwell. Going at fifty cents a yard," said the auctioneer.</p>
                  <p>"Fifty-two cents," said John Vroman, with as much attempt at dignity as if the
                     villagers had always respected him—and there <emph>was</emph> one class who had
                     deceived "old Vroman" (as they called him behind his back) into an idea that,
                     do what he would, his money would keep a few true friends around him.</p>
                  <p>"Sixty cents," was bid by Miss Sommers.</p>
                  <p>"Sixty-two," said John Vroman.</p>
                  <p>"Old Vroman," said a rough voice, "is bidding to spite a dacent family, be
                     jabers! because they are afther knowin' that he's an ould hypocrite, an' it's
                     meself that's knowin' it, too, be jabers! for twinty years or more."</p>
                  <p>John Vroman was grinning as if all that could be said against him were mere
                     jokes! But if Benjamin Bailey had heard the name John Vroman, he might have
                     thought of suspicious circumstances related of the will of Benjamin's
                     grandfather.</p>
                  <pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6367-00000119"/>
                  <p>"Eighty cents," said Miss Sommers.</p>
                  <p>"Eighty-five," said old Vroman.</p>
                  <p>"One dollar," was then offered by Miss Sommers.</p>
                  <p>And still John Vroman advanced the bid. The by standers seemed to be looking on
                     with interest; and Miss Sommers, determined to release herself from their
                     attention, by bidding so high that John Vroman could make nothing by another
                     bid, so she offered:</p>
                  <p>"One dollar seventy-five cents!"</p>
                  <p>The auctioneer cried off the bid. Nobody wanted old Vroman to win the battle.
                     Nobody now believed that he would. But just as the hammer was raised to strike
                     off the goods John Vroman raised the bid ten cents!</p>
                  <p>"Do bid once more, Laura," urged Miss Percival.</p>
                  <p>But Miss Sommers declined to do so. Then it became evident that old Vroman had
                     won the battle, and much regret was manifested by the by-standers.</p>
                  <p>"I fear it might give offense, or I would buy it for her!" said Mr. Dobbins to
                     Mr. Riggs.</p>
                  <p>Just at that moment, and as the hammer was descending the last time a voice in
                     the adjoining room was heard to say:</p>
                  <p>"Two dollars!"</p>
                  <p>The voice was low, but the auctioneer from his elevated position saw and knew
                     the bidder, and in a few moments his hammer went down:</p>
                  <p>"Going at <emph>two dollars</emph> a yard—and sold—to a gentleman!"</p>
                  <p>"Good!" exclaimed a half dozen voices, when they saw that old Vroman at last
                     had lost the battle.</p>
                  <p>At the sound of the voice in the adjoining room Laura Sommers was startled; she
                     thought it so much like that of Benjamin Bailey!</p>
                  <p>The velvet trimmings were then put up and were struck off with only one bid, to
                     Miss Sommers. It was noticed that the one who had bidden off the dress did not
                     bid against her! When the auctions sales were closed and Laura walked away, she
                     said to more than one of her friends, that she wondered if anybody knew who it
                     was that got her dress away from that John Vroman. But no one knew. Days and
                     weeks passed and she often wondered if it was a freak of her imagination, or
                     some strange coincidence of voice, that had made her think of Benjamin
                     Bailey.</p>

                     Chewbrick—Figsley hints about one Jared Bailey—Benjamin's presence of

                  <p>IN Chapter XX., we left Benjamin endeavoring to make the acquaintance of
                     smugglers. Omitting some of his successes and some of his failures, we now
                     notice him again in connection with Figsley and Figsley's associates at
                     Chippewa.</p>
                  <p>There was an old, dilapidated dwelling, at this time, standing on the Canada
                     side of the Niagara River, near the shore, and a short distance above the falls
                     and rapids. This building belonged to Figsley, a part of which he always rented
                     to some fellow smuggler. One of the rooms, on the ground floor, he occupied
                     himself, cooking his own meals. For Figsley had one virtue, (it might have been
                     one of necessity,) he had never married to degrade a wife and innocent children
                     by his own life.</p>
                  <p>By various strategems Benjamin had at last won the entire confidence of
                     Figsley, so far as concerned smuggling. He had bought a row-boat of him, and
                     hired him to assist in smuggling several articles across the river, and to
                     pilot him to the different landing points. And finding that he and one Bergman,
                     who lived in a lone snanty a half mile distant from Figsley's, were in the
                     confidence of a new party of whisky smugglers, Benjamin laid a plan to win
                     their confidence more positively, before asking them too many questions about
                     themselves or others.</p>
                  <p>Bedan, with two other officers, was to be on the watch. Bailey was to be with
                     the two smugglers, and when he found what landing they desired to make he was
                     to advise them to make a different landing, but finally to yield to their
                     choice. Then, while on the river, Benjamin was to indicate to Bedan,
                     cautiously, by signals with his dark lantern, at which of the landings the
                     smugglers might be met. For it had been arranged that Bedan's party were to
                     make a mock attempt to arrest Bailey with the smugglers. And Bailey was to keep
                     the officers back by firing blank charges at them from his pistol.</p>
                  <p>All this had been planned to induce the smugglers to put implicit confidence in
                     their new comrade, Bailey, and thus be led to confide their secrets to him. It
                     was also to insure Bailey's safety among them by preventing any suspicions that
                     he might be a secret detective.</p>
                  <p>The plan was most gallantly carried out. Benjamin was the last one to get into
                     the smuggler's boat on their retreat from the landing where Bedan and his party
                     had made a pretense of attempting to take them—and of course had been most
                     ingloriously defeated!</p>
                  <p>Figsley had arranged to have a team in waiting at a distance from their
                     intended landing, but their plans being frustrated, they now took young
                     Bailey's advice and made their way to Navy Island on the Canada side<pb
                        n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6367-00000121"/> of the river, where they secreted
                     their cargo of whisky to await a more favorable opportunity. The party then
                     repaired to Figsley's room, where the two smugglers unanimously gave Bailey the
                     credit of being the hero of the night; believing that they had been saved from
                     arrest, and their whisky from seizure, by his bravery and "presence of
                     mind!"</p>
                  <p>But their "hero" insisted with a modest smile, that he "did not deserve so much
                        <emph>credit</emph> after all. For," said he, "the officers
                        <emph>appeared</emph> to be scared to death at the very first discharge of
                     my revolver! when the truth is, <emph>I did'nt expect to hit the scamps,</emph>
                     for I'm not a very good marksman even in the daytime!"</p>
                  <p>"Say," said Figsley to Bailey, "did I every tell you now old Chewbrick got the
                     officers out of the way one night, so that he engineered a little boat load of
                     liquor across the river at Youngstown?"</p>
                  <p>"No, Figsley; and you know I'm always fond of listening to a good trick against
                     these impudent officers!"said Bailey.</p>
                  <p>Figsley moved his chair and was about to begin.</p>
                  <p>"Here! this will never do," said Bergman.</p>
                  <p>"What's the trouble, now?" asked Figsley.</p>
                  <p>"Trouble! Isn't whisky the first thing? And then, do you expect me to listen to
                     a yarn till you lend me your old meerschaum?"</p>
                  <p>"Very true! and a very great oversight!" rejoined Figsley.</p>
                  <p>After whisky, Figsley proceeded:</p>
                  <p>"Well, it was down near the old fort where the Niagara goes into Lake Ontario
                     at a very moderate pace; for the river gives up its ravin' jumps and its
                     exasperated jigs a half a dozen miles, you know, before it gets to the fort,
                     and down there behaves itself splendid! Of course, Bailey, you don't understand
                     that locality as well as Bergman and I do.</p>
                  <p>"Well, Chewbrick and his son had agreed to get ten kegs of whisky across there
                     from Canada, and land it at a short ravine just above the fort for a man by
                     name of Robertson, who was to be there with his team; or within reasonable
                     notice, from eleven till one o'clock on a certain dark night.</p>
                  <p>"But, Bailey, you ought to hear Chewbrick tell that story himself, at some of
                     our club meetings! And the beauty of it is, it's a <emph>true yarn,</emph> all
                     but the <emph>coloring,</emph> which Chewbrick always tells a
                        <emph>shade</emph> different.</p>
                  <p>"Well, 'Blowhard' was on hand, (or Robertson, which is the same thing,) wagon
                     and team, and oil-cloth coat, for it was a rainy night. I tell you they are the
                     nights to pick out for our business, after all. Do you suppose any of them
                     corrupt, black republican officials, are going to be on watch quite so closely
                     such nights?"</p>
                  <p>"I should be afraid they would," said Bailey, "for you know they get a quarter
                     of what is seized!"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, but there is an offset to that. They stand just as good a chance of
                     getting a dev'lish good thrashing from us; or," said Figsley, turning towards
                     Bergman, with an exulting laugh, and extending a complimentary allusion to
                     Bailey's late firing at the officers, "they might chance to get one of Bailey's
                     bullets!"</p>
                  <pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6367-00000122"/>
                  <p>"But let me see, where did I drop Chewbrick? O, yes! Chewbrick," Figsley
                     resumed, "had sent his son and a hired man over to a point on the Canada side
                     where the whisky was to be loaded into the boat. And Chewbrick himself was to
                     stay on the American side and watch, to know if the officer on watch left his
                     duty before midnight, the time for another officer to take the patrol. As soon
                     as old Chewbrick found the coast clear, he was to raise and lower the light of
                     his lantern, so that his son would know when to start with the whisky. When
                     they saw this signal his son was to show a light moving up and down a few
                     moments, to notify Robertson, who was then to get his team in readiness as soon
                     as possible. You see in case the custom-house officer did not leave, then, old
                     Chewbrick was to get him out of the way—out of the way (I mean) of Robertson
                     and the boys.</p>
                  <p>"Well, about eleven o'clock old 'Brick' saw Mr. Officer go home—followed him,
                     and saw him enter the house. You see it was a leetle too rainy for Mr. Officer!
                     But Chewbrick was an old fox. How could he tell certain whether the officer
                     would <emph>stay</emph> in the house, or whether the other officer was not to
                     come on duty at that hour for that night. So old 'Brick' waited awhile,
                     thinking which of a half dozen plans he would adopt. But all the while he kept
                     near enough to the officer's house to know if he came out. In this way,
                     however, old Chew, soon saw he was going to lose an indefinite amount of time.
                     So he changed tactics; he went to the officer's door and rapped.</p>
                  <p>"'Good evening, Mr. McQuade,' said old 'Brick,' putting on a patriotic face to
                     the officer, who opened the door, but had hardly time to reply before old
                     Chewbrick, says he:</p>
                  <p>"'Say! McQuade, there is one of the darndest, meanest 'rebel sympathizers' in
                     the whole North, going to smuggle over ten kegs of whisky to-night! I just
                     heard of it in the bar-room at Schneiderberger's.'</p>
                  <p>"'Are you sure of it?' asked McQuade, 'and who told you?' says he.</p>
                  <p>"'Well, that's my business,' said old Chew., 'but if you want to catch the
                     meanest man you ever saw, and will give me five dollars in case your part of
                     the seizure comes to twenty-five dollars, I'll show the very spot where the
                     boat will land!'</p>
                  <p>"The officer, of course, accepted the proposition at once. So McQuade and the
                     old smuggler (or free traders as we call ourselves <emph>politically</emph>)
                     went down the river bank to the very spot where nobody was to land; and just
                     where old 'Chew' wanted to show his son the signal-light; and about a half mile
                     from where the whisky was to be landed for Robertson!</p>
                  <p>"But stop," said Figsley, "I'm a little ahead of my story. The officer had a
                     dark lantern with him which he was inclined to keep open too much to suit old
                     'Brick,' for it might have confused things, you see, if his son had seen the
                     movement of that extra light. Then to put a climax on top of that, Chewbriek
                     says that McQuade made some awful suspicious inquiries—wanted to know what
                     Chewbrick needed a dark lantern for—how long he had had it, etc. But 'Chew'
                     told him it was one he had had ever since Pierce was President; that he used to
                        be<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6367-00000123"/> employed nights to help one of
                     the secret detectives on the same business he was on that night!"</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Same business?</emph> O, I see! of course 'twas," said Bergman.</p>
                  <p>And here they all gave a hearty laugh; and Figsley improved the opportunity to
                     take an old tobacco-box from his pocket and supply his mouth with a little
                     "fine cut."</p>
                  <p>"Now the first thing was," said he, resuming the story, "to get rid of
                     McQuade's light. So Mr. Chewbrick concluded to have his own light go out by
                        <emph>accident;</emph> so he opened his lantern, wondering what <emph>ailed
                        his light!</emph> and somehow, says 'Chew,' the light went out! Then says he
                     to the officer, 'McQuade let me take your light so I can lead the way!' Of
                     course the officer was willing to do anything to help matters along, and so he
                     handed over his lantern.</p>
                  <p>"Now Chewbrick began to fear another difficulty. "What if the other officer
                     should come on duty and go down to the landing where Robertson himself was
                     expected to go, on seeing the signal from the boat. So Chewbrick stopped
                     suddenly, and says he, 'I wonder if we better not go and wake up the other
                     officer to come with us?'</p>
                  <p>"'No,' said McQuade, 'he was out all last night and he wouldn't come; for he is
                     half sick, besides!'</p>
                  <p>"'All right,' said Chewbrick, pleased with the information; 'they are only a
                     man and a boy anyhow, and you've got your revolver, haven't you?'</p>
                  <p>"'Yes; but let the scamps get away with their bodies,' said the officer. 'If we
                     get the boat and the whisky, it will be all <emph>I</emph> care to bother with
                     this dark, rainy night!"</p>
                  <p>"Finally they reached the spot where Chewbrick was to give the signal to his
                     son to bring over the whisky. Now you see it would not answer to have officer
                     McQuade see him do that little exploit. So old 'Chew' pointed, up stream with
                     his hand close before McQuade's eyes, and wondered if that wasn't a light away
                     off there!</p>
                  <p>"But after looking and watching a few minutes in every direction <emph>up
                        stream,</emph> McQuade declared that <emph>he</emph> 'couldn't see it!'</p>
                  <p>"Of course while old Chewbrick was pointing up stream with his left hand, he
                     was, with the other cautiously moving the officer's lantern up and down for a
                     signal to his son down stream! And this he did till he saw the signal light in
                     the boat answering him.</p>
                  <p>"And the same signal in the boat for himself, you see, Bailey, also notified
                     Robertson to be ready with his team at the landing below.</p>
                  <p>"The next thing was to take up the officer's time, which old 'Chew' did by
                     finding themselves a place of concealment, and occasionally swearing, that it
                     was strange that the smugglers hadn't come across, and that he knew the scamps
                     intended to smuggle across ten kegs of whisky before one o'clock that very
                     night. And he knew that they <emph>intended</emph> to land it at that very
                     landing.</p>
                  <p>"At last Robertson had got his load of whisky a good bit away from the lower
                     landing, and on the way to a place where it was to be secreted. And Chewbrick
                     and the officer went home, old 'Chew' pretending to be swearing<pb n="246-247"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000124"/> ing mad at his disappointment, while the officer
                     endeavored to console him, presuming the storm had made them give up crossing
                     that night!</p>
                  <p>"Pretty well done," said Bergman, "but before I had the misfortune to lose my
                     character I did some shrewd tricks myself, watching and misleading customs
                     officers. Why, at one time I was paid by the custom house for detecting
                     smugglers, when, in fact, I was giving information the other way! But, like
                     every other kind of deviltry, it didn't last long before something turned up,
                     and I got suspected; and here I am now, all the worse for what little success I
                     ever had in that line.</p>
                  <p>"The fact is, there is too little honor with most devils among themselves! Why,
                     Figsley, you know I got up that hose and pipe plan by which more than twenty
                     thousand dollars worth of whisky has been smuggled into Buffalo and Tonawanda;
                     and all I got was fifty dollars for the secret; except the positive assurance
                     that if ever I revealed anything about it except in the <emph>regular</emph>
                     way, to the members of the <emph>regular</emph> club, by their
                        <emph>regular</emph> sanction, at their <emph>regular</emph> meetings, and
                     all such dev'lish conditions, why, then I was to be waylaid by a blow upon my
                     head with a professional sand-bag, or gagged and taken to the rapids, and there
                     thoroughly drowned, after first having my skull broken in by a bludgeon!"</p>
                  <p>And here Bergman went off into terrible oaths, calling everybody dishonest, and
                     declaring that the unequal division of property in this world, made it right to
                     demand and enforce a better distribution of it, in any way it could be done
                     safely, whether it was called highway robbery, Wall street robbery, or contract
                     swindling, or any other business, for each man to get his share!</p>
                  <p>"Say, brother Bergman," spoke Figsley, in a low tone, "your confounded talk
                     reminds me of a brother villain I knew more than twenty years ago, whose
                     financial meanness I could always excuse easier than the <emph>selfish
                        advantage and heartless meanness with which he treated his female
                        victims.</emph> He had a habit of swindling them into friendship, abusing
                     their confidence, and then cheating them out of his promises; because, at last
                     he would exact more than even human weakness could consent to. But what you
                     particularly reminded me of was a sharp trick of his rascality to produce a
                     very unequal division of property; which, though the trick pays <emph>me</emph>
                     well enough, I always despised him for getting <emph>two girls</emph> into
                     trouble about it—which I afterwards found he did, the unmanly devil—partly to
                     punish them for their <emph>virtue,</emph> and partly <emph>to frighten them
                        into concealing what they knew against him!</emph> Poor
                        <emph>Eleanor!</emph> she left his house though, and <emph>Adeline,</emph>
                     too, soon after.</p>
                  <p>"Adeline was always in fear of his malicious slanders, as well as losing a
                     portion of the property, which old Mr. Mortimer Bailey had intended for her;
                     but which this Jared (blast the illegitimate bastard) promised to restore a
                     part of to Adeline in case she kept still!</p>
                  <p>"But this is more than I ever told before. This is bad whisky, Bergman. And,
                     see here! how do I know but this young dare-devil is a son of his? it's the
                     same name! What is your first name, Mr. Bailey, and where are your relatives?
                     But, really, you don't resemble the man I spoke of!"</p>
                  <pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6367-00000125"/>
                  <p>For an instant a chill went over Benjamin Bailey, and he was at a loss how to
                     answer. The next moment he decided it would not do for him to be discovered as
                     a relative, nor even as an acquaintance of Judge Bailey; and much less as one
                     of the heirs referred to. He also feared the possibility that Judge Bailey
                     might learn his whereabouts, and write exposing him, as a detective, to
                     Figsley; an idea of itself which produced no comfortable sensations. So he
                     answered that men in their business were not fools enough generally <emph>to be
                        known bg their real names, when it could be avoided.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>"Bravo!" said Bergman. "A man after my own heart! Let us drink to the health of
                     our <emph>hero of the night!</emph> 'Brave as a lion—cunning as a fox!'"</p>
                  <p>The dodge was effectual: and Benjamin felt a sense of relief. And when that
                     night he left Figsley's house, for his lodgings, he felt that the suspicions
                     about the will, years before, had been well-founded, and he had now double
                     reasons for frequent visits to Figsley's!</p>

                              <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Dear Sir—I crossed the river last night with the
                                 same two men who thought I saved them from being arrested by
                                 Bedan's party a few nights ago. I am, however, detecting something
                                 in these men worse than mere smuggling. They are none too good for
                                 highway robbers! I admit I do not fancy crossing Niagara River with
                                 them. To be in danger of <emph>accident</emph> so near the rapids,
                                 from whence no human power could save one, is bad enough in good
                                 company; but it is a little worse when added to this danger I find
                                 myself crossing at night, alone with men I believe fit for
                                 murderers!</p>
                              <p>"I have just learned of a new plan in operation for smuggling
                                 whisky. It is a sub-marine fixture, carried<pb n="250-251"
                                    xml:id="VAC6367-00000126"/> under boats—large or small boats—and
                                 can be secretly detached and sunk at a moment's warning to avoid
                                 detection.</p>
                              <p>"This whisky is conveyed into this sub-fixture on the Canada side,
                                 and taken out and carried away on the American side in a manner so
                                 ingenious that officers have closely inspected everything seen to
                                 be moved from the boat, without the slightest suspicion. And yet an
                                 enormous quantity of liquor has been smuggled in that way in open
                                 day, with officers standing by the boat, and even taking passage in
                                 it!</p>
                              <p>"The sub-fixture has a short piece of strong, stiff, ribbed hose
                                 attached to it, and on the shore there is from two to six rods of
                                 pipe or tubing concealed under the ground, or under lumber, or
                                 whatever may be most convenient reaching from the boat landing to
                                 the cellar of some building, from which loads of anything are taken
                                 in wagons. This building having no apparent connection with the
                                 boat is not suspected. The short hose is adroitly attached to the
                                 pipe while the boat is waiting for passengers or loading; and thus
                                 a connection of tubing is formed from the boat to the building, and
                                 the sub-fixture is filled or emptied. I will explain other
                                 particulars when I see you.</p>
                              <p>"In the mean time would it not be well to have the underside of
                                 boats looked after? also buildings or docks where such a thing can
                                 be practiced?</p>

                  <p>Early in the morning of the same day on which the above letter was written,
                     Figsley crossed the ferry to see Vroman.</p>
                  <p>"Meet me at Bergman's shanty to-night, at dusk," said Figsley to Vroman.
                     "Bergman and I lost our bottom dollar at the St. Catharines races yesterday;
                     and, you say you lost all you can spare; very well, it is coming on winter, and
                     a man must have money. I say, Vroman, a man must have money; at any rate,
                     Vroman, I must have money, because I must have food, drink and
                     raiment—especially drink!"</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Figsley, any man is a fool that drinks or gambles enough to distress
                     himself! But you are a strange talker, Mr. Figsley. Sometimes you say you've
                     got gold in a secret place, or papers that will scare gold, all you need, out
                     of Jared Bailey!"</p>
                  <p>"No matter, Vroman, you know what is up! No cowardice; you want more money, and
                     so do I. Now will you be on hand, I say? It wants nerve, but we are bad enough
                     to be bold."</p>
                  <p>"But Figsley, what can Bergman do to-night? You say his house-keeper died of
                     consumption an hour ago, and will not be buried till to-morrow."</p>
                  <p>"Well, that is Bergman's business, not ours. He says come, he may as well be

                     little of the root of all evil from a rich old cattle dealer expected to pass
                     Bergman's this evening. He wants you and Dick Slyboy to be at his house so that
                     you and he could swear him clear—prove an <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                        >alibi</foreign> you know—in case of necessity. You see, don't you? As to
                     Bergman, swear he was with us all the evening, in his own house. The plan is
                     well laid, Vroman, well laid!"</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Figsley, you and Mr. Bergman both are getting too bold; but I'll think of
                     it. If I conclude it is not too risky, I'll be there."</p>
                  <p>The plan was further discussed, but John Vroman gave no decided answer, and
                     James Figsley returned, muttering to himself as he started, that he knew Vroman
                     hadn't <emph>heart</emph> enough to hinder him from little acts of this kind,
                     and the only <emph>conscience</emph> he had, was his fear of detection!</p>
                  <p>"Plague take the scoundrel," spoke Figsley, to himself, "if I'd never seen him,
                     nor Jared Bailey, either, I'd have been a better man, and I presume that would
                     have been <emph>better</emph> for me. And yet <emph>they</emph> seem to have
                     succeded with even less of heart or soul than I have, which, I vow, is no
                     boasting for myself, for did I not aid them at first to injure Eleanor? and
                     will I not yet forget my own oath to her, and neglect to expose the evidence
                     which would avenge the wrong plotted against her innocence? and all this, when
                     my own room is haunted with her presence!" But we leave Figsley with his
                     reflections, and till we meet him at Bergman's.</p>
                  <p>But there was a web of circumstances which Providence had begun for that day,
                     which, in spite of plans or caution, was now to wind around these guilty ones
                     and their earthly career, to bind them over to that great day, when all must
                     render an account for deeds done here in the body.</p>
                  <p>Soon after James Figsley and John Vroman separated, the latter went to the
                     post-office, where he received the following letter:</p>

                              <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Dear John—Yours is just received. Perhaps I ought to
                                 go and see you instead of writing, but, as all my letters have
                                 reached you safely, I hope there is no risk.</p>
                              <p>"It is astonishing how Figsley continues to make larger and larger
                                 demands on me. You say he is again dissatisfied—talks too
                                 much—threatens to tell the truth, etc., etc—pretends again that he
                                 kept the true will and my two letters about them! Now, this is what
                                 he talked once before when he threatened to show who Jared Grimbold
                                 was, and is, and that if I lived long enough vengeance would reach
                                 me from the grave of Eleanor Grace!' Now this must be stopped or
                                 there must be another mysterious disappearance!</p>
                              <p>"You say this year he demands six hundred dollars instead of four
                                 hundred, and he will not take it in our paper money. Why, in that
                                 case, it would cost me to buy the gold thirteen hundred and fifty
                                 dollars these war times. Now, John, I am not in favor of paying him
                                 that sum, and thus encouraging him to ask more. You had better have
                                 a private talk with him just as soon as you get this letter; and
                                 don't fail to remind him that<pb n="254-255"

                                 just as desperate witnesses to get him into trouble as he can be
                                 against us."</p>
                              <p>"One thing more: you and he had better be on your guard! for one of
                                 the heirs, Benjamin Bailey, is a <emph>United States custom-house
                                    detective</emph> on the Niagara frontier! Besides this, I have
                                 special reasons not to have him get on friendly terms with William
                                 Sommers. If you will prevent all intercourse between him and them,
                                 by reporting that he has hinted things against the character of
                                 Miss Laura Sommers, and if you will also get hold of those secret
                                 papers in possession of Figsley which I wrote about in my last
                                 letter, I will give you a deed of the fifty acres Western land you
                                 wanted; and I will alter my will so Jerusha shall have double what

                  <p>The same morning on which the above letter was received, black Jim stopped with
                     his fish-wagon in the road before Deacon Sommers' mansion. Now it'happened that
                     John Vroman on his way home from the post-office just at this moment came up,
                     stopped his buggy, got out and bought some fish; and in taking some papers from
                     his coat pocket, when he paid for the fish, the letter from Jared Bailey, which
                     he had read and replaced in the envelope was accidentally pulled out of his
                     pocket and dropped upon the ground, unobserved. John Vroman drove away, and the
                     fish-peddler tooted his horn.</p>
                  <p>For Deacon Sommers' family always patronized black Jim; partly because he was
                     Dinah's step-father, and partly because he was an honest, pious, old man, and
                     because the old fish-peddler was no small convenience to the public.</p>
                  <p>"Why didn't my ma come wid ye?" inquired Dinah, as she came running toward the
                     fish-wagon.</p>
                  <p>"Well, Dinah, dat so; she mout a come; an' I doesn't know why she didn't, 'less
                     'twas kase she didn't get started! You know dat berry often de reason, Dinah,
                     wid folks."</p>
                  <p>"But if dey haint got no better reason, dat's an awful poor one," said
                     Dinah.</p>
                  <p>"Ha, ha! dat's so; but I's got some awful good white fish here, Dinah."</p>
                  <p>"O! de lord ob lub! I's found a letter here in de road! May be it's from
                     somebody's beau or suffin," said Dinah, as she picked it up. Then removing the
                     letter from the torn envelop, her eye struck upon the last paragraph, which she
                     managed to make out a few words of, and finally read "Benjamin Bailey!"</p>
                  <p>"De lord of lub!" repeated Dinah; and just at that moment Deacon Sommers with
                     Laura in his carriage drove out of the yard towards them. "My sakes alive!"
                     said Dinah, running toward Laura and handing the letter to her, "here be de
                     berry spook ob dat letter, Miss Laura, dat ye cried so 'bout when de dark
                     closet wor ha'nted! Now, Miss Laura, don't ye hab nobody else but Benjamin
                     Bailey! Dat what ye said, ye know!"</p>
                  <p>Laura took the letter, wondering what Dinah could possibly have found in
                     somebody's lost letter to put such thoughts into her head.</p>
                  <pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6367-00000129"/>
                  <p>As Dinah went back to the fish-wagon she muttered: "Dey start off as ef dey
                     goin' to hab der berry necks broke!" And then directing her talk to the
                     fish-peddler she said: "Ye see dey got to hurry or dey aren't goin' to get back
                     till dark, I reckon Massa Sommers going to get de money for his Canada
                     farm."</p>
                  <p>Laura, of course, looked on the outside of the envelop of the lost letter. She
                     saw it was post-marked Fallington, N. Y. Curiosity prompted her to know the
                     centents of the letter; and she read it, and read it to the utter astonishment
                     of Deacon Sommers as well as herself. Deacon Sommers was convinced as well as
                     confounded. And Laura cried over the mistaken confidence that had been placed
                     in Jared Bailey. She wanted to fly to Benjamin, she said, and beg his
                     forgiveness. "They have tried, like criminals, to make us believe falsehoods,
                     but I love him, and now I <emph>will</emph> love him, and I will tell him
                     so!"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Sommers made no reply. He was too busy consulting his own thoughts; and
                     Laura again ran her eyes over the letter as the tears ran down her cheeks. And
                     for the next mile's drive neither of them spoke—but they thought.</p>
                  <p>"There is the collector of customs," Laura said to her father, in a low tone of
                     voice, as they approched the street crossing, near the custom house. "Please
                     ask him, father, if he knows a young man by the name of Benjamin Bailey."</p>
                  <p>Deacon Sommers reined in his horse and said:</p>
                  <p>"Good morning, Mr. Collector."</p>
                  <p>"Good morning, Deacon."</p>
                  <p>Then the collector and Miss Sommers spoke to each other. Deacon Sommers then
                     said:</p>
                  <p>"As you are a man of few words, Mr. Collector, may I ask you, here, if you know
                     a young man by name of Benjamin Bailey from Fallington?"</p>
                  <p>"I do."</p>
                  <p>"Is he a custom-house officer?"</p>
                  <p>"He is a young <emph>gentleman</emph> in whom I have the utmost confidence,
                     both from what I know of him myself, and from what I am told by those who have
                     known him from boyhood," said the collector, stretching out an indirect reply,
                     which gave Deacon Sommers a hint that he may have been too inquisitive
                     inquiring about a secret office!</p>
                  <p>"I beg pardon," said Deacon Sommers, "I only desired to know who he is!"</p>
                  <p>"Well, Deacon, he is the young man you took such a liking to on the cars this
                     side of Rochester, at the time he gave up his seat so politely to you and me,
                     as you may remember some months ago."</p>
                  <p>"You don't say so?" said the Deacon. "You don't say so?"</p>
                  <p>Laura smiled, but she tried not to.</p>
                  <p>"Also," continued the collector, "the same young man I heard you extolling so
                     highly for capturing the two black-legs some weeks ago!"</p>
                  <p>"You don't say so? Well, now, I declare! And is he a fellow of good habits?
                     temperate, and so on?"</p>
                  <p>"Temperate! he would not drink even a glass of wine to please the President of
                     the United States."</p>
                  <p>Then Deacon Sommers thanked the collector, bid him good-day, and drove on.</p>
                  <pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6367-00000130"/>
                  <p>Laura blushed, looked pleased, and inquired what her father thought now?</p>
                  <p>And Deacon Sommers not only admitted that he was satisfied, but astonished
                     beyond degree.</p>
                  <p>An hour after this time Vroman missed the lost letter. He examined every
                     pocket, even to his watch-pocket, and one coat he had not worn nor seen since
                     the day before. Then he shook out his handkerchief; but found no letter. He
                     retraced every step he had taken since he drove into his yard; inquired
                     repeatedly of all in the house, and finally drove back over the road, toward
                     the post-office, to a place where he remembered reading the letter. On
                     returning he happened to meet the old fish-peddler, of whom he inquired whether
                     he or anybody he knew of, had found a letter.</p>
                  <p>"Was it a letter in a yaller kiver wid de end broke open?" was the colored
                     man's inquiring reply.</p>
                  <p>"Yes; have you found it?"</p>
                  <p>"No, I hasn't got it, but I reckon may be it be de one de girl picked up and
                     gin to Mr. Sommers as he driv out into de road, 'bout an hour ago, or so
                     on."</p>
                  <p>"Where did he go?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, he driv off, somewhere; de girl said to Canada to get some money on a
                     farm dat he sole. I spect he got a heap o' land."</p>
                  <p>"Then the old villain took my letter with him, eh?"</p>
                  <p>"In course <emph>I</emph> doesn't know whose letter it was. I spect it wasn't
                     much value; de letter had been read; for de'velop was torn open, anyhow; and
                     der wasn't no money in it. Dinah, de girl, say it mout be somebody's beau."</p>
                  <p>But while the old colored man was delivering his views to excuse the matter,
                     Vroman was muttering to himself:</p>
                  <p>"The very worst man in the world to have that letter! and Jared was an old fool
                     to risk it! It may send us all to the devil. I'll see Figsley and Bergman now;
                     the money and the letter both are an object; and secrecy is an object—to
                        <emph>several</emph> of us!" Then turning back to the village he telegraphed
                     for Jared Bailey "to come by next train!" For he thought matters might get
                     beyond his control. He then went to see Figsley and Bergman. And his interview
                     with them resulted in a change of the programme for the night.</p>
                  <p>It was agreed to not attack the drover, but to dress in disguise and watch for
                     Mr. Sommers in the milewoods, near Bergman's shanty; and to assault him under
                     pretense of searching for Fenian papers against the Canadian government; but,
                     in reality to get possession of the lost letter, as well as to rob him if much
                     money was found. In the latter case it was their intention to gag and bind him
                     till late enough to send him and horse and carriage over the falls. "A mere
                     accident, to which any of us is liable!" Bergman had said in a wicked joke. The
                     old colored man had said nothing to Vroman indicating whether Deacon Sommers
                     was alone in his carriage; and Vroman in his worry about the lost letter, had
                     not even thought to inquire; hence the company of a female in the coming affair
                     was not down in the programme!</p>

                     Falls—Benjamin resolves to die attempting their rescue.</head>
                  <p>WHEN Benjamin had returned from St. Catharines, and had taken tea at his hotel,
                     it was dark, except the little light which the stars afforded. Having
                     determined, however, to learn more from Figsley, to Figsley's lonesome rooms he
                     wended his way, but only to find that he was absent. Presuming that he had gone
                     to Bergman's shanty in the mile-woods, he then set out for Bergman's. Arriving
                     at the shanty he entered a kind of outside passage or entry, and knocked on a
                     partly open inner-door, leading to the only lower room of the shanty. After
                     waiting a short time, and hearing no person within, he pushed the door a little
                     more open and entered the room.</p>
                  <p>There was a dim light from a kerosene lamp standing on a table in the room, but
                     no one was present. The strong board shutters of the windows appeared tightly
                     closed.</p>
                  <p>In a room overhead, approached by a ladder through a large open place left in
                     the loose floor boards, there was also a dim light. In this upper room, near
                     the opening in the floor, lay the corpse of the house-keeper, who had died that
                     morning.</p>
                  <p>Benjamin had stood a few moments waiting for some one's appearance; when,
                     suddenly he was startled by a half-smothered cry of murder, then followed heavy
                     groans and low voices, and the sounds of approaching footsteps; all indicating
                     a party of several persons close at hand. Thoughts quicker than can be repeated
                     flashed through the mind of our secret detective. It must be that Figsley and
                     Bergman were of the party; and if so, of course he would be safe; and he seated
                     himself upon a short bench near the foot of the ladder which led to the loft,
                     for escape without their observation he could not; and to attempt an escape
                     like a witness against them, it seemed must result in certain death. He knew
                     that Bergman and Figsley had confidence in him—confidence that he was a
                     desperate character, and willing to become—if he was not already—as great a
                     villain as themselves. How could they doubt it? He had told them he came upon
                     the frontier to make money, and that he couldn't afford to be in such dangerous
                     business unless he could make something out of it. They had seen him cautiously
                     and alone smuggling whisky and leather and spices; had passed him on the
                     Niagara River at night, in the very boat that Figsley had sold him for that
                     purpose; then they had afterwards taken him in as a brother law-breaker, and he
                     had saved them from arrest by attempting to shoot the officers—<emph>with those
                        blank cartridges!</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>As our detective took his seat the approaching party seemed to pause a moment
                     in a dispute among themselves at the outer entrance to the shanty, and Bailey
                     soon had occasion to realize that he was in danger.</p>
                  <pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6367-00000132"/>
                  <p>"I tell you this whole affair must and shall go over the falls—girl and all!"
                     said one of the party outside, in a firm undertone, "the rest of you can have
                     the money, but that letter of old Bailey's—the old fool—must never be heard
                     of!"</p>
                  <p>"But if we get the letter that's enough!" replied a voice which Benjamin knew
                     was Figsley's.</p>
                  <p>"But I tell you," said the first voice, "that this old deacon devil here and
                     that young Bailey, are on the track of us all!"</p>
                  <p>There was no time to waste by listening; his real character was no doubt
                     discovered; he could no longer expect the kind regards of either Figsley or
                     Bergman. He could not even expect that they would now return the kindness that
                     he had done them by shooting at custom-house officers! In an instant he now
                     ascended the ladder, hoping to secrete himself till an opportunity presented
                     for leaving the shanty. As he stepped from the top of the ladder he saw by the
                     dim light that he stood by the side of a corpse. Not having heard of the death
                     of Bergman's house-keeper, this discovery produced strange feelings of horror
                     and suspicion; and added to what was already a sufficient cause of alarm.</p>
                  <p>The better to secrete himself he immediately extinguished the light in the
                     loft. He then placed himself in a position to see, through an aperture between
                     the floor boards, anything that might take place in the room below. Almost
                     immediately four men dressed in disguise entered the house; the two foremost
                     dragging an old man to a corner of the room, whose bare head revealed wounds by
                     which he had been overcome. Two others soon afterwards followed, carrying a
                     young lady to an opposite corner of the room. Both victims were bound with
                     cords and were gagged to prevent any outcry.</p>
                  <p>Among the first who entered the room Benjamin recognized Figsley's voice,
                     saying in a determined tone:</p>
                  <p>"No, Vroman! I'll see us both hanged first. You may send the man over the
                     falls, but not the girl! That's not my way of making war—not my kind of
                     chivalry. I'd sooner shoot the man who would abuse a weak and defenseless
                     girl!"</p>
                  <p>"O, you would, eh? Then you've grown better since we all lied against Eleanor
                     Grace for telling the truth against us!" said a voice in reply with an
                     insinuating tone, and closing his remark with terrible curses over the idea of
                     Figsley having any virtues to boast of over the rest of them.</p>
                  <p>"Well, Vroman," retorted Figsley, "I give you my word for it—and my honor—as
                     one villain to another, that <emph>this</emph> girl shall not be harmed!"</p>
                  <p>"And I say she shall never live to tell what this night knows of, nor what's in
                     Jared Bailey's letter!"</p>
                  <p>"She lives, if I do!" said Figsley.</p>
                  <p>"Then none of us would be safe," said Vroman, "and getting rid of her is a
                     necessity we are not to blame for. None of us knew the girl was in the
                     carriage; and she may from the very first have identified some of us by our
                     voices."</p>
                  <p>"Vices? ha! ha! Did you say vices? What vices have <emph>we?</emph>" chuckled
                     Hardstriker, making a peculiar shrug with his shoulders.</p>
                  <pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6367-00000133"/>
                  <p>"Stop your quarrel," interrupted Bergman, with an oath, "till you have time to
                     come to a sensible conclusion!" and saying this he unrolled a pocket-book which
                     he had extracted from Deacon Sommer's side pocket.</p>
                  <p>"Thank the devil, here is a little matter I will take charge of," said Vroman,
                     producing the lost letter from Deacon Sommers' pocket, "and now the only way to
                     keep its contents from sending two or three of us to the bottomless pit, is to
                     send old Sommers and his daughter over the falls. Of course they've both read
                     it; and, as I told you, if that young Bailey around here is really a detective,
                     he would hear of the letter, make us all the trouble he could, and the old
                     suspicions would start up again."</p>
                  <p>At length the money had been counted, and the letter had also been read, and
                     was considered a matter which so far as smuggling was concerned, concerned them
                     all. And from what was overheard by the individual under such peculiar
                     circumstances in the loft, he had an abiding sense that things present and
                     things to come, in a strange combination of ways, were also matters of infinite
                     concern to <emph>him!</emph> Things rushed into his mind as they only can when
                     the mind is under some extraordinary excitement—like a panoramic view of one's
                     life when some sudden death is approaching. His blood quickened its course over
                     the wrongs which Judge Bailey had done him. The fraud of the will—the
                     falsehoods to Deacon Sommers and Laura—the letter just injuring him as a
                     detective—the present imminent danger of his own life; and more than all this,
                     an innocent and a beautiful girl was in the power of ruffians, and that girl
                     the one he loved! All this nerved him to a desperate resolve to attempt the
                     rescue of Laura and her father.</p>
                  <p>The cold sweat stood upon his forehead while he looked with wide-open eyes on
                     the scene below, and prayed silently for Almighty God to aid him now to deliver
                     the innocent out of the hands of the guilty!</p>
                  <p>But his own heart responded that the day of miracles was past. The only weapon,
                     too, which he had taken with him that day, was a small, single barrel pistol.
                     And he was even without ammunition to load it after the first fire! And yet
                     again and again he mentally prayed that God would show him the means of
                     deliverance; and as his hopes sank he prayed for 'faith' in prayer!</p>
                  <p>"Well," said Bergman, "what is to be done must be done now. For the storm is
                     getting over and three of you have some ways to go. Besides that, it's near a
                     mile to the rapids to get this job off our hands."</p>
                  <p>"Your heartless cowardice," said Figsley to Vroman, "which leads you to call
                     for the destruction of this girl, gains nothing by reminding me of Eleanor
                     Grace, and how, years ago, when we sold ourselves to Jared Bailey, that
                     damnable work led me on and on to what I am! You remember how like a mean and
                     degraded coward to defend himself, he tempted us with money to rob Eleanor of
                     her friends, because he could not bribe her to falsehood! You and I know
                        <emph>how</emph> her heart was broken and <emph>why</emph> she disappeared.
                     I shall not add another such victim to my memory! And when I am out of Jared
                     Bailey's pay and power—and yours, too—vengeance shall<pb n="266-267"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000134"/> rise for him out of the grave of Eleanor Grace.
                     And now I swear by her memory, I will defend this girl from harm by my life if
                     need be. So fit your plans to that!"</p>
                  <p>"Figsley, you do but mock yourself. There lies the girl before you, bound in
                     cords; and you know her tongue <emph>must</emph> be silenced or all our necks
                     be stretched."</p>
                  <p>"Then free them both," said Figsley; "restore the money, and there's no
                     robbery; our excuse in these times is fair, <emph>if we thought them
                        Fenians!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"The money is too much to restore!" said Hardstriker, "quite too much!"</p>
                  <p>"And the money we keep!" added Slyboy.</p>
                  <p>"And the man goes over the falls!" said Bergman, "and the girl—why, perhaps we
                     might send her away."</p>
                  <p>"No, I'll not risk it," said Vroman, half beside himself, with fear and rage.
                     "The only safe plan is the 'accident over the falls,' for them both."</p>
                  <p>"Vroman!" said Figsley, "you and I are villains, at best, but, by my soul!
                     (though lost it is) I'm a man yet, and so long as blood runs in my veins, and I
                     have eyes to behold beauty, weakness and innocence, I'll defend woman as I
                     would a child; and I'll see not the strong arm of man lifted against the life
                     of any woman! nor to degrade her—against her will! And this I swear upon my
                     honor, as one villain to another!"</p>
                  <p>"Coward!" said Vroman, with the look of a demon, "I'll despatch the girl myself
                     to save ourselves, and end this quarrel at once." But as he said this and drew
                     forth his pistol for the hellish deed, he still kept his eye on Figsley, in
                     whose look he seemed to read danger!</p>
                  <p>It was now high time for the individual in the loft to close his prayer and
                     come to the rescue.</p>
                  <p>And in that very instant Benjamin Bailey saw the answer to his prayer. The
                     solemn means of rescue was at his side. It was an instant for life or death. He
                     seized the corpse of Bergman's once abused house-keeper and threw it down among
                     the robbers as if it had jumped among them; Benjamin uttering at the same time
                     in a slow, monotonous voice:</p>
                  <p>"Sinners! your days are numbered!"</p>
                  <p>But the same moment that he seized hold of the corpse and threw it from him, he
                     heard the discharge of two pistols. Figsley had shot Vroman dead, and received
                     himself a mortal wound from Vroman's revolver! The other four, shocked at the
                     result of the quarrel and frightened at the descent of a ghost among them, for
                     an instant could not move. Bergman cried, "O, my God! forgive me!" and then
                     flew from his shanty, followed by Hardstriker and Slyboy, and another whom
                     Benjamin had not recognized. Figsley raised up, rolled his eyes towards the
                     corpse in its winding-sheet and groaned; "O, God! is this the day of judgment?
                     or, is this a spirit from the grave of Eleanor Grace?"</p>
                  <p>Benjamin hastened down the ladder in time to hear the receding footsteps of the
                     robbers and note the direction of their flight. And then with a heart too full
                     of emotions for utterance he tenderly unbound and ungagged Laura and her
                     father.</p>
                  <p>"O, kind sir, who are you? who are you?" said Laura, when she realized that she
                     was in the presence of<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6367-00000135"/> a friend, and
                     was assured that her father was not dangerously injured; for in the dim light
                     and her almost unconscious state from fright, she had not yet recognized their
                     rescuer.</p>
                  <p>Deacon Sommers spoke at the same time: "Tell me," he said, "my dear sir, what
                     is the meaning of all this, and are you a friend or foe?"</p>
                  <p>To both questions Benjamin now replied: "I am a detective officer, and by the
                     blessing of God your lives are saved." Saying this he opened the light of a
                     dark lantern which sat near them so that he could be plainly seen, and then he
                     said only as a faithful lover could have said it: "My dear Laura, do you know
                     me?"</p>
                  <p>"O, my dear Benjamin!" she said, with emotions that no words can describe, and
                     grasping his hand, "My dear Benjamin, is it you? is it you? O, father, it is
                     Benjamin Bailey! it is Benjamin Bailey!"</p>
                  <p>But it is impossible to picture the feelings of Deacon Sommers and his daughter
                     and Benjamin, as they looked upon each other and on the scene before them!
                     which scene we leave to the imagination of the reader, except to relate that as
                     they were about to leave the solemn and frightful place, Benjamin took
                     possession of two revolvers which the robbers had lain upon the table while
                     counting the money, all of which, together with the lost letter, were left by
                     the frightened criminals in their hasty flight. The money and the letter
                     Benjamin placed with his own hands back into the pocket of Deacon Sommers.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Figsley," said Benjamin, before leaving him, "you cannot live, probably,
                     many hours. I cannot move you now, but will have a surgeon sent to care for you
                     soon as possible. But as you are about to die it can do you no harm, Mr.
                     Figsley, to tell me the truth. For I am Benjamin Bailey! and you know something
                     about the will of my grandfather, Mortimer Bailey, which you and John Vroman
                     signed as witnesses, twenty years ago. Is there any evidence to prove the truth
                     against Jared Bailey?"</p>
                  <p>Figsley seemed to realize that his life's end had come; and as Benjamin put him
                     in an easier position he replied:</p>
                  <p>"Jared Bailey was no relation of your family—he was a foundling—born in Canada.
                     But it hurts me so to talk."</p>
                  <p>He rested a moment and then added in a weak voice:</p>
                  <p>"You will find some secret papers—under the floor—of my room—which tells the
                     truth. They are—in the grave—of Eleanor—Grace!"</p>
                  <p>These were Figsley's last words.</p>
                  <p>The storm had now cleared away, and by the light of the lantern, a little way
                     from the roadside, Benjamin found Deacon Sommers' horse tied to a tree. Leading
                     it into the road Benjamin assisted Laura and her father into the carriage, and
                     then getting into the carriage himself he drove to the house of a friend in
                     Chippewa, where they remained awhile in consequence of Deacon Sommers'
                     condition from the wounds he had received.</p>

                  <p>AN hour after Deacon Sommers had washed the blood from his face, at the house
                     of his friend, he had apparently recovered almost as much from the effects of
                     his wounds as from his fright.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the police were apprised of matters that had taken place, and
                     the proper authorities left to look after the affairs at Bergman's shanty.</p>
                  <p>A carriage was procured, and one or two friends escorted Deacon Sommers and his
                     daughter home; <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>And as straws show which way the wind does blow,</l>

                        </lg>
                     </q> so it need not be recorded here all that was said by Deacon Sommers to
                     Benjamin Bailey. Even the fact that Deacon Sommers offered him no reward in
                     money, as might have been natural for an expression of gratitude, or to balance
                     obligations, was noticed favorably by Benjamin; while the manner in which Laura
                     and her father urged that he would accompany them home, greatly encouraged
                     him.</p>
                  <p>He longed to know Laura's feelings towards him; but he said at last, to Deacon
                     Sommers:</p>
                  <p>"How can I, Mr. Sommers, how <emph>can</emph> I accept your invitation, to be
                     one moment in your house, where I must see the one I love, only because your
                     gratitude, and not your <emph>respect,</emph> invites me there?"</p>
                  <p>"O, Benjamin," said Laura, bursting into tears at his reference to herself and
                     his constancy to her, "don't blame my father. How could he think they would
                     tell <emph>such falsehoods?</emph> But he found it all out at last, and wanted
                     to see you so much!"</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Bailey," said Deacon Sommers, "I feel deeply the just rebuke of your
                     words, and the manly nature they indicate. But this occasion of my gratitude
                     has not come before I learned to respect you! And I urge you now to go home
                     with us that I may apologize, and explain, before expressing my gratitude. I
                     was too confiding where there was an interest to injure you! I should have
                     taken more pains to have learned the truth."</p>
                  <p>A few moments later and it happend somehow as natural as if it had been decreed
                     to be so, that Benjamin Bailey was seated by the side of Laura Sommers; and
                     this in the same carriage with her father.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Sommers and his daughter had been expected home before dark; and Mrs.
                     Sommers had become uneasy about them. Even the showers of rain which had
                     descended that afternoon, she thought would not have delayed them to so late an
                     hour in the evening. The covered carriage and high oil-cloth boot in front,
                     must have made them prefer a drive in daylight rain, than to risk the
                        weather<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6367-00000137"/> after dark. But if
                     darkness had overtaken them on the road, some accident it seemed must have
                     happened to them. Or it might be that some evil person had found out that he
                     was going after money, though she was certain they had taken pains not even to
                     let the servants know of it.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps she never knew how innocently Dinah had been the means of conveying
                     that information to John Vroman by way of the fish-peddler.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Sommers and his escort at last reached his mansion. Mrs. Sommers met them
                     at the door. From the light of the hall lamp in an instant she discovered, or
                     fancied she discovered, that something unusual had happened. And her anxiety
                     over their non-arrival was now almost changed to alarm at their appearance. But
                     Deacon Sommers immediately informed her that they were all safe and little
                     harmed; and though they had met with a little danger among some desperate bad
                     men, it was all over now.</p>
                  <p>"We've had an awful time! mother. "We came near being murdered!" said Laura,
                     with less of caution in her announcement.</p>
                  <p>The next instant Mrs. Sommer's excitement and retrospective alarm was equaled
                     by her confusion and surprise as she noticed the presence of Mr. Benjamin
                     Bailey among them; whose name Laura then announced with what seemed to her
                     mother, a singular emotion of excitement and satisfaction, as she rushed,
                     weeping, to her mother's arms.</p>
                  <p>For a few moments Mrs. Sommers could scarcely determine mine what ideas in her
                     own mind were uppermost—safety, and danger, and murder, and what it all had to
                     do with Benjamin Bailey!</p>
                  <p>Explanations, of course, followed. And on that evening Benjamin Bailey was a
                     welcome guest in the family of Deacon Sommers!</p>
                  <p>The lost letter which Figsley had read while Benjamin listened in the loft at
                     Bergman's shanty, and which Laura and Deacon Sommers had previously read, made
                     explanations easy respecting Benjamin, but it pointed to a mysterious field of
                     inquiry on the morrow—into the character and secret history of Jared
                     Bailey.</p>
                  <p>Laura's transition from so much fright to so much joy at being restored to
                     confidence in the integrity, honor and manly worth of her well-tried and
                     faithful lover, was almost more than she could bear.</p>
                  <p>How Deacon Sommers explained his giving so little attention to the account of
                     Mrs. Hartley exposing Judge Bailey, and how he was so deceived as to doubt her
                     veracity, we need not repeat events to record.</p>
                  <p>"It needs not any gratitude," said Deacon Sommers to Benjamin, "as any part of
                     my reasons now for believing as I do, that you are worthy of my daughter. I
                     have been deceived by Jared Bailey and through those who have been deceived by
                     him, or who were, and perhaps still are, dependent upon him. And that letter,
                     found to-day, shows that there is still more to be developed against him."</p>
                  <p>"To-morrow morning," replied Benjamin, "I must know what will be found below
                     the floor of Mr. Figsley's<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6367-00000138"/> room. If
                     I find secret papers there, I hope I may learn what he meant by saying that
                     Jared Bailey was no relation of mine."</p>
                  <p>Yes, on the morrow Benjamin Bailey was there to witness a scene nearly as
                     exciting as that through which he had just passed. For Judge Bailey had
                     received the telegram from Vroman, and would arrive on the morning train.</p>
                  <p>At nine o'clock the next morning Benjamin with several citizens and an officer
                     was in Figsley's room.</p>
                  <p>They proceeded to remove the stove and then a large piece of zinc, which, had
                     been so firmly nailed to the floor that one of the party, a superstitious old
                     man, who knew that they expected to find a mysterious grave there, suggested
                     that the zinc itself appeared to have been fastened down by some guilty hand to
                     help hide what had been buried beneath! The floor boards under the zinc, it was
                     noticed, were so nailed and matched that it seemed as if they might have been
                     sometime taken up and replaced; and yet like the nails in the zinc, it needed
                     first to have a suspicion awakened before it would have been noticeable.</p>
                  <p>As they made an opening through the floor, they saw below it, only such rubbish
                     as old plaster, and fragments of brick from some old fire-place or chimney, and
                     this covered the ground. The space between the rubbish and the floor was
                     narrow, and tightly enclosed by a stone wall under the sills of the building,
                     which, together with the nature of the rubbish, prevented any appearance that
                     could give indication as to whether it had long remained there undisturbed.</p>
                  <p>Moving aside the rubbish they excavated the ground to the depth of some three
                     feet, when they came to a layer of flat stones; underneath which they found a
                     straight-sided coffin, whose state of decay rendered the cover easily removed;
                     when there was exposed to view the skeleton of a woman. The position in which
                     the bones lay, indicated that the body had been respectfully cared for. But why
                     was the burial in this secret place?</p>
                  <p>Nothing which might contain the secret papers to which Figsley had referred was
                     visible. With solemnity and respect Benjamin and all present uncovered their
                     heads and stood a few moments in silence around this mysterious grave!</p>
                  <p>While in this attitude a stranger, accompanied by Figsley's tenant, entered the
                     room; and Benjamin fastened his eyes upon the large and burly form of Jared
                     Bailey! Neither of them spoke. The Judge approached and looked into the grave.
                     The color went from his face; he looked upon the persons present, and then
                     around the room. He knew nothing of what had passed except what the sudden
                     scene before him was revealing, and that Vroman had gone to Figsley's the night
                     before concerned about the lost letter! Learning this at Vroman's house on his
                     arrival, he had immediately hastened to Figsley's. And now there were awakening
                     memories torturing his very soul with fear, as if all his secrets were about to
                     rise up against him from the grave before him! He remembered Figsley's threats
                     and his allusions to the grave of Eleanor Grace, and how he had wronged that
                     innocent girl to cover up his own crimes—he trembled, as<pb n="276-277"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000139"/> if he believed that Figsley's dark allusions and
                     vague threats had foretold his destruction here. And yet he strove as if for
                     dear life to meet everything in his usual manner—to appear the embodiment of
                     innocence! and to stand upon dignity.</p>
                  <p>But from Benjamin Bailey who now possessed the key to his heartless soul and
                     secret crimes, his usually bold and brazen face did not now conceal his
                     alarm.</p>
                  <p>After a few moments' pause Benjamin suggested that the ground be loosened
                     around the coffin; which being done, an earthen jar with a tightly sealed cover
                     was found close to the head of the coffin! Benjamin opened the jar. It
                     contained a letter and two packages.</p>
                  <p>"From the writing on the outside of these papers," said he, "it appears they
                     are intended for the heirs of my father. The superscription reads:</p>
                  <p>"To John and Benjamin and Matilda Bailey, heirs interested in the property of
                     Mortimer Bailey, deceased."</p>
                  <p>"Then opening a paper tied on the wrapper of the larger package, he read aloud,
                     as follows:</p>
                  <p>"This is to certify that I, Miss Eleanor Grace, do declare that this writing
                     contains my dying statement, to be exposed when it can harm no one but Jared
                     Bailey—a man, who, to contradict the truth I was obliged to utter against him,
                     has succeeded by falsehood and the aid of those interested, or bribed, or
                     entangled with him, to turn every earthly friend against me, till, without
                     honorable means of support, I have returned thus far, to take vengeance on my
                     slanderer! But I am too weak to go further, aud now here, I will die, begging
                     this rough man to take vengeance for me; which he has sworn to do when he can
                     with safety to himself—"</p>
                  <p>Had Benjamin read the remaining lines upon this paper, he would have seen upon
                     the bottom the signature of Eleanor Grace. But a groan from Jared Bailey, as he
                     sank into a chair, caused Benjamin to put the papers into his pocket and aid
                     the others present in attempting to resuscitate his greatest enemy—the man who
                     had defrauded him of a fortune, and by falsehood had broken up the happy
                     prospects of his marriage.</p>
                  <p>But all efforts at resuscitation were useless. Five minutes later and Jared
                     Bailey had ceased to breathe. His agitation over the evident certainty of being
                     exposed in what he had so long hidden from the public, was more than the state
                     of his diseased heart could endure. A fatal rupture was produced, and thus his
                     death was strangely connected with the last criminal attempt of Vroman and
                     Figsley! And, stranger still, it seemed that he had been sent there, after so
                     many years, by the mysterious ways of Providence, to meet the vengeance of
                     Eleanor at her grave, for his punishment. And from the relation which it all
                     bore to the course which Jared Bailey had begun years and years before, it
                     furnishes a remarkable illustration of the distance to which moral causes will
                     reach results to bring just retribution upon those who forsake the paths of
                     honor, and who attempt to entangle the innocent to cover their own guilt.</p>
                  <p>The grave under Figsley's floor was now covered over for the present. The
                     papers were examined and left with the Canadian authorities, to await such
                     action as they might deem necessary.</p>
                  <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6367-00000140"/>
                  <p>Benjamin now returned to Deacon Sommer's, where, as soon as he entered the
                     house, he was received with renewed manifestations of gratitude and respect.
                     Mrs. Sommers took him by the hand, saying:</p>
                  <p>"Bless the Lord for what you have done for us, Benjamin!" And she kissed him as
                     a mother would have kissed a grown-up son, and then she added: "We have talked
                     of you all the morning."</p>
                  <p>But before she had begun the last remark, Laura had gained possession of
                     Benjamin's hand, and she declared she "would kiss him too, if she never did
                     again!" And she doubled her mother's example; while Benjamin returned Laura's
                     affectionate grasp of the hand and innocent kisses with a fervor that each
                     understood—an engagement renewed.</p>
                  <p>Deacon Sommers at the same time, slowly arose from a sofa, upon which he was
                     reclining, at the opposite side of the room, and advanced towards them, holding
                     a saturated cloth to his forehead with one hand, while he extended the other to
                     Benjamin Bailey, and, in turn gave him sincere welcome.</p>
                  <p>At length Benjamin proceeded to give them an account of the sad and singular
                     scene which he had just witnessed in Figsley's room; and also of the discovered
                     papers! One of the papers found, and which was in Figsley's handwriting, read
                     substantially as follows:</p>

                              <p>"The grave in which these papers will be found, contains the
                                 remains of Miss Eleanor Grace.</p>
                              <p>"Her dead body has been thrown upon my hands to punish and haunt me
                                 for a cruelty that Jared Bailey and his family are more guilty of
                                 than I am. Her story about the will was true. Ours against her
                                 character was only told to defend ourselves! It was cruel as murder
                                 itself; and for this poor, innocent creature's sake, I would give
                                 the world could I restore her now to life, and take back the injury
                                 we did her.</p>
                              <p>"She came back here to make Jared Bailey retract what he had said
                                 to the young man she loved. She got as far as here, and said she
                                 was too weak to go further; called for pen and paper, and wrote
                                 what is herewith enclosed; then in a fit of despair swallowed a
                                 dose of strychnine and died!</p>
                              <p>"Finding that no one knew that she had come here, I feared that it
                                 might be suspected that I had poisoned her, from some motive
                                 perhaps about the will, or something else, and so I buried her
                                 secretly with these papers. Jared Bailey knows that I have buried
                                 her with these papers, but does not know where. So long as I keep
                                 his secrets he must pay me well!</p>
                              <p>"One package here contains some of his own letters about the will
                                 affair; also the true will, which Mortimer Bailey read and signed;
                                 also a second, unsigned will, which he thought he signed, but Jared
                                 Bailey had slipped it away and put the one in its place which had
                                 been prepared privately for that purpose.</p>
                              <p>"There is another little bit of correspondence here, which I
                                 propose to keep, in order to hold Jared Bailey and his lady to
                                 their agreements. For, when men are<pb n="280-281"

                                 Vroman and I have done, I'm in favor of getting my pay by keeping
                                 things in my own power as much as possible. He talks of leaving
                                 this section, but if I choose he will find facts can reach him
                                 wherever he goes. The little narrative of Eleanor Grace, herewith
                                 enclosed for safe keeping, with some other papers, he and his
                                 aristocratic wife would not care to have made public! Two of his
                                 own letters to Vroman—no matter how I came by them—and one of Mrs.
                                 Bailey's, will rather tend to keep us all on a level, I think.</p>
                              <p>"The heirs will see by papers inclosed, that Jared Bailey is no
                                 relative of the Baileys. Mortimer Bailey, while living in Canada
                                 with his first wife, took him out of pity when an infant. His real
                                 father was Jerry Grimbold, a tavern-keeper in St. Catharines, who
                                 at last died in Welland jail. His principal virtues were deviltry,
                                 tobacco and whisky. The worst thing about John Vroman is, that he
                                 is a half brother of Jared Grimbold. And the worst thing about me,
                                 up to this date at least, is, that after selling myself as their
                                 witness in the fraud against the Bailey heirs, I was obliged to
                                 help them, wrong Eleanor Grace, who was too good to marry me. And
                                 now I am cursed with her frightful presence! Poor Eleanor; on my
                                 part I only intended to frighten her from exposing the crime. But
                                 Jared Bailey intended more than I dreamed of! Good heavens! if I am
                                 a bad man, read what she has written of Jared Bailey. Read what
                                 Jared Bailey did in his vain attempts to degrade and to subdue
                                 Eleanor and Adeline. When they would have married happily, husbands
                                 of wealth, education and influence ence, he laid plans to defeat
                                 them, blasting their hopes to accomplish his own; but baffled by
                                 their virtue in every attempt to degrade them—even by promises
                                 which, as a libertine, he never intended to fulfill—he stooped at
                                 last to bold abuse and shameful advantage.</p>
                              <p>"Failing in all, at last he attempted to degrade them by entangling
                                 them with us in a sanction and concealment of the fraud in the will
                                 by offering them a bribe; and then it was that I, too, was
                                 interested in degrading them, <emph>for they knew of the part I had
                                    taken in the fraud!</emph> Then it was they both left the house
                                 of Jared Bailey forever—Adeline, paid and frightened into silence,
                                 but Eleanor destroyed in saving her innocence!</p>
                              <p>"O, heavens! had I foreseen it all, I would have been happier to
                                 have lived an honest slave and deserved the gratitude of those poor
                                 girls, rather than bear the remorse of having aided these
                                 brother-villains thus to have persecuted their innocent lives,
                                 though I had gained the whole of Mortimer Bailey's property!</p>

                                 now I scarcely know my own purpose; though I would to God that this

                  <p>JARED BAILEY was buried in Fallington cemetery. The Rev. Mr. Smoothwell
                     preached the funeral sermon. And the several instances where Mr. Bailey had
                     given a few dollars to some distressed family, and the fact that he had
                     contributed to the usual popular benevolent causes, and paid the largest rent
                     for the most prominent pew in the most wealthy church, and had been the most
                     liberal in gifts to the pastor—all this, together with other influences with
                     which the reader has been made acquainted, seemed in the opinion of society to
                     have struck a balance to his credit, and to have stigmatized all rumor against
                     him, as the base and revengeful work of his enemies; when in fact the late
                     developments connected with the letter which Vroman had lost, and the papers
                     found in the grave, and all that directly implicated Jared Bailey in a criminal
                     and disgraceful course, had, out of kindness to his alarmed and bereaved family
                     and friends, for the present, been concealed from the public, at the suggestion
                     of Mr. Sommers, and consented to by Benjamin himself. Therefore, in spite of
                     old or recent rumors, the Rev. Mr. Smoothwell knowing little of the facts, and
                     remembering only his own sermons on charity and forgiveness, said an eulogy to
                     the good deeds of Judge Bailey, making a respectable reference to his life and
                     character.</p>
                  <p>"The immediate cause of Mr. Bailey's death," said Mr. Smoothwell, with perhaps
                     innocent feeling, "showed but too plainly how easily he was affected over the
                     misfortunes of others. It is true that he had been afflicted with a disease of
                     the heart. But the immediate cause of the rupture which produced death, was the
                     shock given him on suddenly learning the fate of a beloved adopted daughter,
                     who, many years ago, had mysteriously disappeared and met an early grave, under
                     circumstances too painful to relate, and which, coming to light, was the
                     occasion of Mr. Bailey's late visit to Niagara, the scene of his death."</p>
                  <p>Here, again, was the character of poor Eleanor, so long since dead, slandered
                     by unjust insinuation, which Mrs. Judge Bailey in her secret alarm had thought
                     necessary to convey to Mr. Smoothwell, and insist that he should refer to the
                     matter, "to prevent," as she said, "any chance for false rumors!" In Mrs.
                     Bailey's alarm Mr. Smoothwell, however, saw only regret, affection and
                     bereavement!</p>
                  <p>Immediately after the funeral services the will of the late Judge Bailey was
                     read, when behold not one cent of the property promised Adeline for her
                     silence, was willed to her; the wish, however, was expressed that Mrs. Bailey
                     would continue to be kind and generous towards <emph>her as they always had
                        been!</emph> To Mrs. Bailey one-third of the property was willed, and to
                     Jerusha, in<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6367-00000143"/> an indirect way, there
                     was willed an amount nearly equal to one-third; and the remainder about equally
                     divided among the rest of the family.</p>
                  <p>A few days after the reading of the will Benjamin Bailey and Hon. Mr. Baldwin,
                     as his attorney, accompanied by Deacon Sommers, waited upon Mrs. Jared Bailey,
                     and David, and Jerusha. Mr. Baldwin immediately proceeded to explain the nature
                     of the disclosures found in the grave of Eleanor Grace, and certain other
                     evidence which papers there found had furnished the means of tracing out. "Mrs.
                     Hartley's letter as to your own private conversation on certain matters," said
                     Mr. Baldwin to Mrs. Bailey, "has been fully sustained. The story of poor
                     Eleanor Grace, whom you sacrificed by falsehood to cover the truth she could
                     not conceal against your husband for you, is fully corroborated."</p>
                  <p>He was then proceeding to explain what Mrs. Bailey knew too well was truth as
                     to how the will-fraud was managed, when Mrs. Bailey fainted. After a little
                     time, however, she was restored. They were then informed that Adeline had fully
                     corroborated the other disclosures about the will, and that unless she and her
                     family and Jerusha saw fit to accept some offer which the rightfull heirs of
                     the property might see fit to make them, the whole property would be recovered
                     from Mrs. Jared Bailey and her family, and they would be disgraced in
                     court!</p>
                  <p>"And will I lose all dear Mr. Bailey promised father and me that I should
                     have?" asked Jerusha, bursting into tears.</p>
                  <p>"From what we have lately learned, Miss Vroman, we think you certainly will!"
                     said Mr. Baldwin.</p>
                  <p>"Give us time to think!" implored Mrs. Bailey, as the three gentlemen arose to
                     leave the house.</p>
                  <p>"O, yes, give us time to think and say nothing!" repeated Jerusha, "say
                     nothing!"</p>
                  <p>Not long after this interview a settlement was agreed upon by which at last
                     nearly all the property was obtained by the rightful heirs.</p>
                  <p>To those who possessed the opportunity of learning the facts which had
                     disclosed the real character of the late Jared Bailey, the little of other
                     matters which also came to light, made it clear why Jerusha, the daughter of
                     John Vroman, had been willed so large a share of the property, while it stood
                     to Adeline's credit that she expected so little.</p>
                  <p>Adeline had been intimidated to sign the will as a witness, and then made to
                     believe she was thereby in law as guilty as those whose plans she had happened
                     to discover. But, soon after Eleanor's disappearance, Adeline herself had
                     quietly arranged to leave Jared Bailey's family, ostensibly to learn the trade
                     of a dressmaker, but her reasons for learning the trade itself were the private
                     reasons why she left her adopted home. The fate of poor Eleanor for having
                     uttered so much of the truth as to turn Jared Bailey and his wife into
                     merciless enemies, warned Adeline not to appear on unfriendly terms with them.
                     Hence it was that she received the did she did from Jared Bailey and his
                     wife.</p>
                  <p>In consideration of all the circumstances Benjamin, in<pb n="286-287"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000144"/> the settlement, allowed Adeline the sum of two
                     thousand dollars, which it appeared to have been the intention of his
                     grandfather to have willed her.</p>
                  <p>Of course it was not long after these events when Benjamin and Laura were
                     married. For a time they lived in the old home near Fallington. But it was
                     scarcely one year before Mrs. Benjamin Bailey had the satisfaction to receive
                     their many friends, both from the village and the country, in a splendid
                     mansion which Benjamin erected near his old homestead.</p>
                  <p>About this time Dinah's step-father, the old fish-peddler, died, and Dinah's
                     mother then went to live with Laura as a servant. Occasionally poor old
                     Tom—whom the reader will remember in the front yard denouncing Judge Bailey and
                     extolling Benjamin as "de finest young man <emph>he</emph> ebber seed"—spent an
                     evening talking with Dinah's mother about "de hard ole times in slavery," and
                     often his eyes would grow dim with tears in recalling to mind "little Tilly,"
                     "aunt Polly," and years agone.</p>
                  <p>Matilda, Benjamin's sister, at the time of closing this book, was not married,
                     but it was expected that she would be soon, to a son of Hon. Mr. Baldwin; for
                     Mrs. Bailey, Matilda's mother, had been heard to say:</p>
                  <p>"Mercy on me! I hope young Baldwin and Matilda won't have any such trouble
                     about courtin' as Benjamin and Laura had to have!" And then she had repeated
                     her exclamation declaring Benjamin's wife to be the best hearted person that
                     they had ever known "for such a handsome woman!"</p>
                  <p>Poor Col. Le Grange! his fate was a sad one. He went into the Army of the
                     Potomac, fought reckless of his own life—which induced his commander to report
                     as "great gallantry"—in the battles of the Wilderness, and was finally at the
                     taking of Richmond and the surrender of Gen. Lee to Gen. Grant. As he had said
                     in his letter to Miss Laura Sommers, that he would do, so he had sought "the
                     front of battle to lay down his life," etc. But fate failing to accept the
                     sacrifice, he returned home, fell into despondency, and finally became a
                     monomaniac, and seemed to court exposure and danger by constantly venturing
                     along the banks of Niagara, as if in search of something, he knew not what.</p>
                  <p>Finally, on the Canada side of the Niagara Whirlpool, in one of the colonel's
                     wild ramblings, he selected a spot beneath the overhanging rocks of the high,
                     precipitous bank, and there building himself what is now pointed out to
                     visitors as the Hermit's House in the Cave, he spent the rest of his days. For
                     nearly two years he lived there a crazy recluse, seldom speaking to any one,
                     except to inform them that he "wanted no spies around these head-quarters of
                     the Potomac!" For hours together, with none but a faithful dog for his company,
                     he would sit, playing an old violin, at the same time gazing on the singular,
                     circuitous movement of the water at that romantic place in the Niagara
                     River—which the visitor now approaches by a winding stairway.</p>
                  <p>At last he obtained a small row-boat, and, conceiving the idea of risking
                     himself and dog in boat-rides close along the Whirlpool shore, he was one day
                     carried into the terrible vortex.</p>

                  <p>Guides will continue to point out to the traveler the place of the hermit's
                     descent down the bank, and the relies of his home in the cave. Poor Col. Le
                     Grange!</p>
                  <p>But we have one more incident to record.</p>
                  <p>At Benjamin Bailey's old homestead, not long after his marriage, he one day
                     brought a small package into the house for his wife, which he informed her he
                     had just received by express from Niagara Falls.</p>
                  <p>"O, it is some present from home; I know it is!" said Laura, with a cheerful
                     smile, as she thought of her everthoughtful parents.</p>
                  <p>"No, my dear, I shall claim this as a special present for you from myself"—and
                     then he added with a smile and manner as if the package contained some
                     mysterious surprise—"and I am sure that you will be delighted with it for it is
                     just what you wanted sometime ago! And then, too, it will be such an
                     interesting souvenir of Niagara! I think a great deal of it, and I know you
                     will, too."</p>
                  <p>"Do, please, open the package, my dear, I am so eager to see what kind of a
                     present you have ordered."</p>
                  <p>"O, I know it will suit you; it's just your taste; I don't think anybody on the
                     frontier could choose a nicer piece of merino in Canada!"</p>
                  <p>"Why! Benjamin, what makes you smile so queerly about it? Where was it
                     bought?"</p>
                  <p>He was now removing the wrapper, and his smile had increased to a laugh as he
                     said:</p>
                  <p>"I bought this at an auction, Laura! I might have sent for it before this, but
                     somehow I left it with a friend, on the frontier, there, awhile, by name of Mr.
                     Dobbins!"</p>
                  <p>The package was now open, and Laura joined in the laugh, as she recognized her
                     Canada dress pattern—and the <emph>mysterious bidder!</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>"Why, Benjamin! O, mother Bailey! just look here! I'm surprised out of my
                     senses!" said Laura.</p>
                  <p>But when mother Bailey had looked at the goods and felt the fineness of its
                     texture, she said in a lower tone than usual:</p>
                  <p>"Why, mercy on me, darling! It's only some merino dress goods!"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, mother," said Laura, as she and Benjamin both laughed till mother Bailey
                     was astonished. "Yes, mother, but it is a dress pattern that I tried to smuggle
                     out of Canada across the suspension bridge!"</p>
                  <p>"Mercy on me! Laura," said Mrs. Bailey, "does everybody smuggle at Niagara
                     Falls?"</p>

                  <p>REACHING across the chasm of the Niagara River, two miles below the great
                     cataract, is one of the most noted as well as most beautiful bridges in the
                     world. It was built by a company of Americans and Canadians, and is the first
                     suspension railroad bridge ever constructed. Its ingenious workmanship was
                     constructed under the direction of John A. Roebling, a German engineer, and was
                     completed in 1855, having been three years in building, and costing half a
                     million dollars. It is a single span, eight hundred feet in length, twenty-four
                     feet in width, and supported by four immense wire cables hanging over stone
                     towers. The most heavily loaded railroad trains cross upon its upper floor, and
                     carriages and footmen on a floor beneath. Deep down in the chasm, two hundred
                     and fifty feet below, rushes the mighty rapids of Niagara! The boundary line
                     between the Dominion of Canada and<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6367-00000147"/>
                     the United States is along the center of the deepest part of the river; hence
                     the west end or half of the bridge is in British territory, and the east half
                     in the United States. Large amounts of freight pass here as traffic between the
                     two countries; and still larger amounts pass over this bridge and through a
                     portion of Canada as traffic between New York and Chicago. Here at the crossing
                     of this chasm, the United States constructed buildings for a custom house, and
                     a number of officials were required for duty. An account of some of the
                     incidents at this point which came under my own observation while a customhouse
                     official, a portion of the time between 1860 and 1870, will be interesting and
                     amusing, as well as bring out some desirable information respecting
                     custom-house regulations—strangers at Niagara—and life on the Niagara
                     frontier.</p>
                  <p>From May until November the large hotels at the Falls of Niagara were open to
                     receive the thousands who came to visit this romantic locality.
                        Here,<emph>then,</emph> was fashion, beauty, wealth, aristocracy—and all the
                     varieties of travel which the scenery here annually brought together. Of these
                     visitors almost entirely were the passengers who, in more than a hundred
                     splendid hacks daily crossed the suspension bridge, and proceeded to the
                     various points of interest upon the Canadian bank of the river, and after a few
                     hours returned to the American side; when, according to the custom of all
                     nations, they were required to satisfy the custom-house officer that they were
                     not smuggling any goods into the United States. It was not the duty of a
                     custom-house officer, in every instance to inspect spect the vehicles of
                     persons who were accustomed to cross the bridge. We had become acquainted with
                     the business of nearly all, for miles on either side of the river, who were in
                     the habit of crossing the bridge with their teams, and knowing the persons, and
                     that they themselves knew the penalties for smuggling, an occasional inspection
                     of their vehicles was sufficient. By law the penalties for smuggling were
                     imprisonment, fines and confiscation of the property smuggled, and also the
                     loss of the team and vehicle, or vessel or boat in which the goods were
                     smuggled. Even in cases where the property brought into the country was
                     intended to be returned in a few hours, the person was liable to forfeit the
                     goods unless the same were properly reported to the custom house.</p>
                  <p>When visitors of Niagara Falls had made any purchases upon the Canada side—even
                     though the articles were only presents to take home from the Falls—they were
                     required to report them. The drivers and owners of the hacks were also liable
                     if the same were not reported. When no purchases were made the drivers, as they
                     passed my office, cried out: "<emph>Nothing aboard, sir!</emph>" And, excepting
                     when I thought best to examine the matter further, I usually replied:
                        "<emph>All right, sir.</emph>" By this it was understood that there was no
                     baggage on board for inspection, and no dutiable articles, and that I
                     recognized the vehicle and team as belonging to parties upon the American side,
                     or, to persons who would soon return the same to Canada.</p>
                  <p>It was a requirement, however, of the custom-house<pb n="294-295"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000148"/> department, that proper judgment should be used
                     in all discretionary matters. All baggage and goods were to be inspected; and
                     if the officer had any grounds to suspect any person had smuggled goods
                        <emph>concealed upon their persons,</emph> he could, by law, require them to
                     be examined; and for this purpose women were frequently required to report to a
                     lady officer.</p>
                  <p>The laws relating to customs in the United States, as well as in some other
                     countries, were numerous and complicated; so that many of the best informed
                     people who came to visit the wonders at Niagara Falls, were often surprised to
                     find that they had lain themselves liable to unexpected expenses and delays,
                     which, had they read these reminiscences, they would have avoided.</p>
                  <p>The driver of a fine hack returning from the Canada side once halted his
                     valuable establishment before my office to allow the stranger in his carriage
                     to make a report of some Canadian purchases.</p>
                  <p>"Drive on, sir," said the statesmanly looking passenger.</p>
                  <p>"I suppose," said I to the dignified looking gentleman, "that your driver fears
                     to pass the custom house, if he or his passenger has any dutiable articles in
                     his carriage."</p>
                  <p>"O, you are an officer of customs?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir. Endeavoring to collect what is legal, to aid in paying our national
                     debt!" said I.</p>
                  <p>"Glad to find you are so loyal, sir; but I have only a few Indian curiosities
                     and some "Table Rock specimens'—just to take home from Niagara Falls—only about
                     thirty dollars worth."</p>
                  <p>"Fifty per cent, duties, sir, on the Indian bead work, and thirty-five per
                     cent, on the little, ornamental, bark baskets," I informed him.</p>
                  <p>"Is it possible?" said he, with a smile. "I wonder if I ever aided in making
                        <emph>that</emph> law?"</p>
                  <p>"When he had paid the duties and had signed his name, James Lane, to the oath
                     upon the entry papers, I remembered that I had seen him once in Washington, and
                     the next moment I knew that it was senator Lane of Kansas.</p>
                  <p>I have seen a carriage load of fashionable and richly dressed ladies pretend,
                     with mechanical stares, great indignation or surprise, that their extravagant
                     outfit of dry goods and millinery, waterfalls and jewelry, should be held in
                     such cheap account that the driver could boldly report "<emph>Nothing
                        aboard!</emph>" to an admiring official, who would then reply to the
                     professor of hacks, "<emph>All right,</emph>" as if he believed it.</p>
                  <p>This common report, "nothing aboard," was frequently made the text for joking
                     comments by carriage loads of health, wealth, comfort and pleasure; but to me
                     it was often, the source of suggesting a strange variety of reflections. The
                     rich man passes with fine linen and costly clothing, with bonds and greenbacks,
                     and perhaps a box of cigars and a bottle of brandy as a part of his traveling
                     luxuries; and all this is reported "<emph>nothing aboard!</emph>" And now comes
                     a poor man, with a bundle of old clothes, and perhaps a piece of new but coarse
                     cloth—enough for coat and pants—which he thought he could afford, because a
                     little cheaper in Canada, and this he must not report as "<emph>nothing
                        aboard,</emph>" and finds the duty fifty cents a pound and thirty-five per
                     cent ad valorem!</p>
                  <pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6367-00000149"/>
                  <p>One dark and rainy evening in 1866, there came from the Canada side into the
                     United States, across this great, international bridge, a young woman and a
                     little lad, in an old, rickety wagon, drawn by an aged horse, whose comfortable
                     days seemed long gone past. The gatekeeper called out for their ticket, which
                     passengers purchased at either end of the bridge before entering upon it, and
                     the girl gave up the ticket as they halted.</p>
                  <p>It was next my duty, as an officer of customs, to determine if this horse and
                     wagon, or other property, if any, were liable to duty. For they must pay duty
                     upon their conveyance, poor as it was, or poor as they were themselves, or turn
                     back to Canada, no matter how urgent their business, unless they had evidence
                     that the property belonged in the States, or they could satisfy me that it
                     would be soon returned to Canada. Observing that they were about to proceed
                     without reporting any facts in the case to the office of customs, I said:</p>
                  <p>"Young lady, on account of the rules of the custom house, I shall have to
                     inquire if your horse and wagon belong in the United States?"</p>
                  <p>"We belong in Buffalo, sir," the girl replied, "and we are trying to get home
                     to-night, sir; or, as far as we can, sir."</p>
                  <p>"What!" thought I, "a young girl and a small lad, in an open wagon, going to
                     Buffalo such a dismal night as this, and that city twenty-four miles
                     distant!"</p>
                  <p>"At what place was this horse and wagon taken into Canada?" I inquired, and
                     when informed that the property had been taken across the Niagara River on the
                     steam ferry-boat, near Buffalo, I asked "if they had taken any export
                     certificate from any custom-house officer so that they could take the property
                     into Canada and return it to the States free of duty?"</p>
                  <p>"No, sir, we didn't know any officers at the ferry, sir," replied the girl. And
                     then in a tremulous voice and in words that I could not regard with suspicion,
                     she added:</p>
                  <p>"We haven't, done anybody any harm, sir. It's our horse and wagon, sir."</p>
                  <p>I then inquired if they were acquainted with any one near us whom they would
                     name, to give me some reference, so that I might be justified in case I took
                     the risk of allowing them to pass.</p>
                  <p>"No, sir," replied the girl, "we are acquainted with nobody here, sir."</p>
                  <p>"Then," said I, "I am sorry to have to tell you that unless you can give me
                     some evidence, or at least some reference, that would justify me in letting you
                     proceed without paying the duty, the custom-house rules require you to go back
                     to the Canada side."</p>
                  <p>"O, sir," said she, bursting into tears, "we cannot go back that way to-night.
                     We live in Buffalo. We are poor people, and we did not know what we had to do.
                     We cannot get across the ferry at night if we go back that way."</p>
                  <p>"It will be morning before you can reach the ferry," said I. But she only
                     answered this by weeping. Though I had found a flaw in her answers, and had, as
                     an officer, become generally sensitive to suspicion, my feelings told me that I
                     must let her pass. Innocent embarrassment<pb n="298-299"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000150"/> might easily be a cause of an inconsistent
                     remark. Was it among the possibilities, thought I, that this lad and this girl
                     had been sent across from Canada with a story to deceive the custom-house
                     officer, and thus smuggle this horse and wagon? Was I to be deceived by some
                     shrewd trick of a smuggler? Perhaps I was over-suspicious; but it was not a
                     pleasant reflection among customhouse officials on the Niagara frontier to find
                     themselves occasionally outwitted by smugglers. Nor had I forgotten the
                     successful trick by which a party had once smuggled a valuable lot of silks and
                     laces across this bridge before the eye of one of the strictest officers, when
                     these goods were concealed in a coffin, carried past him in a slow, solemn
                     hearse, followed by the <emph>smugglers in mourning!</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence I <emph>was particular!</emph> And in answer to my questions the girl in
                     broken sentences told her pitiful story. Their father had gone to St.
                     Catharines in Canada, one week before, and not returning when expected, and his
                     family hearing that a man had been drowned in the Welland Canal, answering the
                     decription of the father, this son and daughter had gone there prepared for the
                     worst. While the daughter spoke of her father and sobbed as if her heart would
                     break, I felt that her story must be true. But I had not yet examined the
                     contents of the wagon, and just at this moment I saw, by the light from the
                     bridge lamp, that there was a dark colored bundle in their wagon, partly
                     covered by straw which from the light shining but dimly upon it, I could not
                     clearly discern. I took hold of the dark-colored object more from a habit of
                     inspecting than from any suspicion of smuggling. I had also been in office long
                     enough to know that even an apparent omission of duty—no matter about the
                     combination of little circumstances which satisfied the good sense of an
                     officer—must have some <emph>tangible</emph> explanation, <q>
                        <p>To make others see ourselves as we do see us!</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>So it was partly this feeling of caution which caused me to lift up from the
                     bottom of the wagon what proved to be an article of clothing. At the same time
                     I inquired what they had aboard.</p>
                  <p>The girl was now too much affected to reply, and I was myself shocked by the
                     evident truth of the lad's mournful answer:</p>
                  <p>"It is the coat which father had on him when he was drowned!"</p>
                  <p>And indeed I <emph>was inspecting the clothing, damp yet, with the water which
                        had caused the dying struggles of their father.</emph> Is it wonder that
                     they now sobbed aloud, not well understanding the cause of such cruel
                     suspicion! for it was no covering of smuggled goods that in the dim light I had
                     moved aside in their wagon and lifted up before them. And as the lad in broken
                     accents told me what it was, and with my hands and eyes upon it I saw at a
                     glance how the coat was ruffled and torn by the hooks with which strangers had
                     searched for the dead body! I dropped the garment; I believed their story; I
                     let them pass; and as they went I reflected—they have "<emph>nothing
                        aboard</emph>"—but grief! That night the body passed over the upper floor of
                     the bridge by railroad; and the coffin<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6367-00000151"
                     /> passed, I have no doubt, the suspicious gaze of other custom-house
                     officers.</p>
                  <p>As in many other noted localities of the world, so at Niagara the traveler
                     finds bazaars, in which are kept for sale appropriate, curious and interesting
                     mementoes, consisting in part of Indian curiosities, geological specimens,
                     stereoscopic views of the various points of interesting scenery about the Falls
                     and along the Niagara chasm.</p>
                  <p>Beautiful specimens of bead work, and of bark work curiously ornamented with
                     colored porcupine quills, are brought here for sale not only from Indian tribes
                     near the Falls, but I have seen some of these articles, brought across the
                     bridge and reported to the custom house, which were made by Indian women in
                     tribes living in the British possessions a thousand, miles west of Niagara.</p>
                  <p>The beautiful feather fans, however, now sold at Niagara Falls and at Saratoga
                     Springs and in the city of Washington, were first invented about the year 1840,
                     by Miss Handcock, a lady of taste and education, who at the time I am writing,
                     still resides within a few rods of the railroad suspension bridge, upon the
                     American side, living in poverty and alone.</p>
                  <p>Nearly all of the bazaars where these mementoes of Niagara were kept for sale,
                     were upon the American side of the Falls. There were, however, three or four
                     buildings upon the Canada side where Indian curiosities and other mementoes of
                     this locality were kept for sale. And in the carriages which were almost
                     constantly crossing to and from the Canada side were passengers, who purchased
                     considerable amounts of these articles. But on being required to pay a duty of
                     thirty-five to fifty percent, to the United States custom house, they began to
                     realize that they were returning from a foreign country. If the party were in
                     good spirits and the officer had the tact to keep them so while he performed
                     the unpleasant duty of searching their baggage, and requiring them to report
                     all articles purchased, the ladies sometimes smilingly announced that they had
                     "purchased a feather fan to <emph>fan</emph> with; or a small, bark canoe, <q>
                        <p>'To sail the wide seas over,'</p>
                     </q> or an Indian baby's moccasin, covered all over with pretty beads; beads
                     white and beads blue, and do you really believe the Tuscarora Indians made it?
                     The man told us so." By this time, or more probably while the other lady was
                     talking, another lady of the party would remind her that they had "also
                     purchased their dinners in Canada!"</p>

                  <p>AMONG those who made short visits into Canada, across the suspension bridge,
                     were sometimes citizens as well as strangers, who were evidently not in the
                     habit of restricting their use of intoxicating drinks to <q>

                     <pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6367-00000152"/> and were accustomed to raise their
                     spirits <emph>up</emph> by turning spirits <emph>down.</emph> As these persons
                     passed the custom-house office, sometimes their burlesque reports,
                        "<emph>Nothing aboard, but Canada whisky,</emph>" were
                        <emph>manifestly</emph> correct!</p>
                  <p>People residing upon the frontier, knew, generally, that the United States laws
                     prohibited the importation of whisky in quantities less than thirty gallons;
                     and other liquors also in less than wholesale quantities. There were few
                     strangers, however, who knew that such a law existed.</p>
                  <p>A bottle or two of any kind of liquors could be legally seized, if brought from
                     the Canada side, even if the person offered to pay duty. Although I do not
                     affirm that I always seized such small quantities; I did sometimes obey the law
                     to the letter; especially when it appeared that a quart bottle stowed away
                     under a vest, or in a side pocket, was more than the man could carry, or an
                     intentional disregard of custom-house laws. I have seized a toper's bottle of
                     whisky from under the ragged coat of a little boy, hoping that the father would
                     never send him on such an errand again.</p>
                  <p>I recall an instance, too, when I examined a carpet-bag of a woman in which I
                     found a little food and a bottle of milk for her children. But something made
                     me suspect that the contents of the satchel, so willingly offered me to
                     examine, might be a decoy to lead me from suspicion. So I conducted her to the
                     house of the lady examiner, near by. When I returned to my office, the toll
                     receiver, who had the name of being strict and watchful in his own business,
                     met me with a hearty laugh, and volunteered a very confident
                        "<emph>guess</emph>" that I had caught no smuggler <emph>that</emph> time. A
                     by stander also joined in the same opinion, and added that officers might as
                     well suspect everybody else as that woman!</p>
                  <p>I then informed them of the fact that the <emph>innocent looking</emph> lady
                     had just been examined by the inspectress, who found concealed among her
                     clothing, a jug of whisky! The duty on whisky at this time was two dollars per
                     gallon; hence people who crossed the bridge several times a day could make it
                     profitable to smuggle even small quantities at a time.</p>
                  <p>I once tried to talk temperance to a washer-woman whom I detected smuggling
                     whisky in flat bottles, and who was "half seas over," but she insisted that
                     when she had to work so hard a quart of whisky made her stronger!</p>
                  <p>"Stronger!" said I, "I should think not, you can hardly walk straight now! It
                     makes you weaker!"</p>
                  <p>"Ah' faith, now! Is it that ye's sayin'? An' doesn't it make my <emph>breath
                        sthronger?</emph> An' mus'n't ye brathe strong if ye's workin' at all, at
                     all?"</p>
                  <p>"But it will kill you to drink so much whisky," I replied.</p>
                  <p>"An' if it does, then I shan't have to kill myself a workin' to get me livin'!
                     Ye see I ain't much valye meself, any way."</p>
                  <p>"But, madam, it is against the law for any one to bring whisky from Canada in
                     this way, as I've told you before this!"</p>
                  <p>"An' sure it's not that, now, you'll make me be afther<pb n="304-305"

                     bein' stopped by a dacent man like yourself, now?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, madam, I have taken you to the lady examiner and found you smuggling
                     bottles of whisky too many times to overlook it much longer."</p>
                  <p>"Indade it's your own fault that you have found it! an' it's no counthry
                        <emph>at all,</emph> at all, if we haven't the liberty of our own
                     pockets!"</p>
                  <p>Where admonition was disregarded a few seizures in such cases was generally an
                     effectual discouragement.</p>
                  <p>One pleasant morning a drover came across the bridge on foot, carrying a
                     well-filled traveling-bag, and was proceeding to pass the custom-house office
                     without reporting whether his baggage contained dutiable goods, when I informed
                     him, as politely as I could, that it was a rule of the custom house to inspect
                     baggage passing here. He turned with an angry reply:</p>
                  <p>"What's the use of bothering us every time we come through here, to open our
                     traveling-bags? You know well enough we never have anything but our
                     clothing!"</p>
                  <p>"I have no doubt, sir," I replied, "that you are as honest as any stranger that
                     passes my office; and though I may believe that no stranger's baggage contains
                     smuggled goods, the government requires me to <emph>know</emph> it by actual
                     inspection."</p>
                  <p>"Well, I guess!" retorted the angry man, "I rather <emph>guess</emph> my
                        <emph>word</emph> is good, and when I tell you I have nothing dutiable,
                     that's <emph>enough!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"I have no reason to doubt your word, sir."</p>
                  <p>"Then why don't you <emph>take</emph> it, sir?"</p>
                  <p>"Simply because it is my duty not to do so. I see no more reason to pass
                        <emph>your</emph> baggage without <emph>knowing</emph> what is in it than to
                     pass that of other strangers. You will have to open your baggage, sir!"</p>
                  <p>The enraged drover then set down his traveling-bag, and threw a bunch of keys
                     upon the floor, swearing that if I was so particular as <emph>that</emph> I
                     should open it myself, for <emph>he wouldn't!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"Stranger," said I, forcing a smile, "I have plenty of time this morning, but
                     is it extremely polite, sir, for a man of your evident good sense to throw your
                     keys upon the floor and expect me to pick them up, and then waste time to pick
                     out the right key?" The drover seemed scarcely more annoyed than surprised at
                     the manner I assumed; but he replied:</p>
                  <p>"Well, if you arn't going to examine my traveling-bag I shall take it and go
                     on!"</p>
                  <p>"My friend," said I, looking him earnestly in the eye, "I have come across a
                     great many kinds of people while here in the custom house, and I can generally
                     manage to do everything pleasantly. And I do not intend to be drawn into a
                     quarrel. Your baggage, however, will be detained here till you pick up your
                     keys and open it!"</p>
                  <p>"You have no right to bother me about my baggage at all; for all there is in it
                     came from Detroit, and I haven't stopped in Canada nor bought anything
                     there."</p>
                  <p>To this I said nothing. He hesitated a moment, and then picked up the keys and
                     proceeded to open his<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6367-00000154"/> traveling-bag;
                     and, to swear that I was no gentleman for doubting his word; that he would
                     report me as an unreasonable officer if he could find out where to do so!</p>
                  <p>By this time he had opened his baggage, and on examining it I found a quantity
                     of tobacco—not so much that I need to have seized it—and yet enough considering
                     his disregard of duty in not reporting it, to have justified me in seizing it.
                     So I said:</p>
                  <p>"Stranger, if I were disposed to do so the course you have taken in neglecting
                     to report this tobacco, would justify me in seizing it, no matter where you
                     bought it; but I have so much pity for your ungovernable temper and your
                     evident ignorance of custom-house laws, that I shall permit you to go, and I
                     will pass the tobacco just the same as I might have done had you treated me
                     politely; and I do not even expect your thanks for doing you the favor which is
                     in my discretion."</p>
                  <p>My utter astonishment was completed when, without seeming to notice what I had
                     said, he asked "<emph>if I didn't intend to pack his baggage as nicely as I
                        found it?</emph> Kase," said he with an oath and a curse, "you've
                     disarranged it."</p>
                  <p>The idea of my having disarranged a pair of old pants and a dirty shirt, etc.,
                     which I had found crammed into a traveling-bag to hide his tobacco, was so
                     ridiculous that I smiled as I replied:</p>
                  <p>"No, sir!"</p>
                  <p>But he seemed to preserve a remarkable <emph>evenness</emph> of temper as he
                     started off, swearing that I had detained him when he was in a hurry! and
                     hadn't believed him like a gentleman, when he had <emph>told</emph> me he
                     wasn't bringing things out of Canada! and that I had treated him like a thief!
                     and that I ought to be reported to Washington or some place, he wished to God
                     he knew where!</p>
                  <p>I considered, at the time, that I had lost that battle; it seemed I had not
                     even gained a moral advantage. He had completely driven me from the field of
                     discussion—had abused me before and after I had granted him a favor, and, in
                     all probability, would boast of out-witting me with his Canada tobacco, and
                     exaggerate the quantity in order to make out some charge against me in the
                     neglect of duty as an officer!</p>
                  <p>I tried to think of some passage in the Scripture, from which I could derive
                     consolation; but memory only upbraided me with the passage in Proverbs, which
                     advises us to "answer a fool according to his folly." And then I regretted that
                     I had not tried some profound explanation like Sambo's, when he explained to a
                     colored individual, why "de moon ware ob more immense importance dan de sun;
                     kase," said he, "de moon gib light in de <emph>night time</emph> when we
                        <emph>need</emph> light, but de sun only in de day time, when <emph>we don't
                        need none!</emph>" For ludicrous sophistry is more potent with some people
                     than fairness and good sense.</p>
                  <p>But this incident of the drover who had that morning no doubt taken a dose of
                     Canada whisky, has a sequel.</p>
                  <p>A few months after I had written the account of the above incident, which I
                     wrote soon after it occurred, I got on board a train of cars in company with my
                     wife. The car was being crowded with passengers. Observing two seats near each
                     other, occupied by only one gentleman<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6367-00000155"
                     /> man each, I asked one of the men if he would be so kind as to take a seat
                     with the other gentleman, so that myself and lady could have a seat together.
                     He coolly replied:</p>
                  <p>"I presume, sir, that you can find a seat in the next car!"</p>
                  <p>Just at this moment a rough looking man, a half dozen seats in front of us,
                     arose and said to us:</p>
                  <p>"Here is a seat the gentleman and lady can have, and I'll find another for
                     myself somewhere."</p>
                  <p>We took the seat, thanked him for his kindness, and he found another. I
                     remarked to my wife that that stranger had a good heart in his jacket, if he
                     did look a little rough externally. The circumstance, however, was soon
                     forgotten or stowed away in the rubbish of memory, where human foresight sees
                     not, whether it will ever be called up again.</p>
                  <p>A few weeks passed. I was again in my office. A drover having crossed from the
                     Canada side called at my office door, and reported his traveling-bag for
                     inspection. He proceeded to open it, as if he had passed an office of customs
                     before. After a moment or two, I had a faint impression that I had seen this
                     stranger before. A few words in a friendly way passed between us. At last, as
                     the recognition flashed upon me, I said:</p>
                  <p>"My friend, are you not the man whose tobacco I passed, about six months ago?"
                     When I made this inquiry I had not the faintest idea that he and I had ever met
                     before or since the tobacco affair. But imagine my surprise when he
                     replied:</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir, and I am the man who gave you and your lady a seat in the cars the
                     other day!"</p>
                  <p>He said this in a manner so friendly of the two incidents, so strangely
                     contrasted, that I cannot describe the effect which it had upon my feelings! I
                     remembered the scene with the drover and his tobacco only as plainly now, as I
                     did the incident of his kindness in the cars. I took him by the hand, and we
                     were immediately friends. And, when at last he left my office, he <emph>did not
                        swear</emph> that he "would report me to some place, he wished to God he
                     knew where!" but he did urge me, if ever I came West, to come and spend a week
                     in his prairie home. With pleasure I assured him that I should be glad to do
                     so.</p>
                  <p>The victory was won; the manner in which I had treated his hasty and passionate
                     course in our first interview, gave me a friend, when an angry course on my
                     part would have given me an enemy.</p>
                  <p>After the above incident, I saw more than ever before, the wisdom, and beauty
                     of that scripture injunction, "<emph>charity!</emph>" And that they who can
                     govern themselves best, can after all, govern others most. Forbearance and
                     kindness towards others in the wrong, when we are in the right, is
                        <emph>not</emph> cowardice, but moral bravery and power to reason rightly.
                     It stands above considerations of petty selfishness, and is high philosophy, as
                     well as the truest Christianity.</p>

                     Springs—Suspension Bridge Tolls—A Midnight Office—The Devil and his
                     Wife.</head>
                  <p>WHILE in my office one day, there came across the bridge a stranger, whose
                     whole appearance indicated poverty. The pack which he carried looked like
                     poverty's bundle! Such instances had been frequent. I had often permitted them
                     to pass with a slight scrutiny. In this case I saw fit to have the man show me
                     what his burden did really consist of. As I had expected, I found nothing
                     smuggled. The toll receiver smiled as he saw me inspect the bundle of this man,
                     so apparently a pauper; and he also informed me that "of course the man could
                     have nothing dutiable for he had crossed the bridge by begging a free passage!"
                     An intelligent and influential gentleman who happened to be in the ticket
                     office saw me put this poor man to the trouble of showing what was in his
                     bundle—a trouble of <emph>ten seconds.</emph> A few minutes before that he had
                     seen a well-dressed man pass my office with a well-filled satchel, in the same
                     direction, and I had simply looked at him, and allowed him to pass without an
                     inquiry; and yet the latter was an entire stranger, and I knew nothing of the
                     contents of his satchel.</p>
                  <p>In a few days after this, it was reported by a politician who desired my
                     situation, that I used no judgment in the discharge of my duty as a
                     custom-house officer; and the above circumstances were cited in proof of the
                     above allegation. A friend came and told me that somebody was finding fault
                     about my course as an officer; but he hoped that there was no just occasion for
                     it.</p>
                  <p>"Anything in particular complained of?" I inquired.</p>
                  <p>"Something about your examining the bundle of a pauper, last week, and paying
                     no attention to the baggage of well-dressed strangers."</p>
                  <p>"Any other case talked of?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, I've heard of your putting some of our influential citizens to the
                     trouble of opening their baggage!"</p>
                  <p>"How do they tell the beggar story?" I inquired.</p>
                  <p>My friend related what the "intelligent and reliable gentleman" in the toll
                     office had noticed. I heard him through, and then said: "Major, I'm surpised;
                     I'm perfectly astonished at the account you have given!"</p>
                  <p>"There!" said my friend, "I told them that I did not believe you were either so
                     indiscreet or so careless in your official duties."</p>
                  <p>"But wait, Major, you don't understand my surprise! I am astonished only, to
                     find" that the 'intelligent and reliable gentleman's' account of what he saw
                     was so accurately told!"</p>
                  <p>"True? Is it true?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, true!"</p>
                  <p>"Then in the name of common sense can you explain it to your advantage?"</p>
                  <p>"Easy enough, sir. The well-dressed man, whose traveling-bag I did
                        <emph>not</emph> examine, had not been in Canada<pb n="312-313"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000157"/> at all. I remembered him as having only a little
                     while before gone on the bridge—saw him standing on the bridge to look at the
                     falls and the rapids, and noticed he did not cross into Canada. This part the
                     'intelligent gentleman' had not seen. Now, as to the pauper. Do you suppose,
                     Major, that I can afford to have smugglers find out that every man can pass me
                     with a bundle, if he be only disguised as a pauper?"</p>
                  <p>The Major laughed, and changed the subject.</p>
                  <p>"When he left me I could not suppress a few reflections. Was it not possible,
                     after all, that an "intelligent gentleman," perhaps, too, an "influential
                     gentleman," or a "<emph>reliable source,</emph>" sitting down a moment to
                     observe other people's business, might see very simple facts which he couldn't
                     see through? And, as a general rule, is it not fair to presume that there are
                        <emph>reasons</emph> for some things if people's conclusions could only get
                     sight of them? while sometimes it is "La! me! why, Mrs. <emph>Jones</emph>
                     heard so, and of <emph>course</emph> Nathaniel was to blame!" <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>Well, it's a fact that isn't a wonder,</l>
                           <l>That people are liable to blunder;</l>
                           <l>And hence the best that any one can do</l>
                           <l>Is just to reflect—a moment or two.</l>

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am here reminded of an amusing incident in the school-days of Gerrit Smith,
                     when he once preferred reflection even to explanation.</p>
                  <p>A few of the students were in a room at a play or game which had been
                     forbidden. Suddenly it became known that the profesor was coming. It was
                     doubtful whether the students would have time to escape at one door before the
                     dreaded professor would enter at another. Gerrit hid himself flat upon the
                     floor behind a bench and under a writing-desk. The others barely managed to
                     escape from the room before the old professor entered. But the man of
                     discipline had heard the confusion; and, glancing his eyes around the room, he
                     spied a human form under the desk; when, coolly addressing himself to the
                     object, he inquired: "<emph>Who is that under the desk?</emph>" The individual
                     under the desk, without the slightest change of position, slowly and
                     deliberately answered:</p>
                  <p>"Gerrit Smith, sir."</p>
                  <p>"What are you doing <emph>there?</emph>" sternly demanded the professor.</p>
                  <p>To which interrogatory, Gerrit, with the air of one not wishing to be
                     disturbed, replied:</p>
                  <p>"<emph>I am reflecting, sir!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>The professor smiled, and left the room, remarking that "it was
                        <emph>well</emph> if Gerrit had been driven to reflection!"</p>
                  <p>The duties on all merchandise prevented much intercourse between the
                     inhabitants of the Canadian and American sides of the river. The toll received
                     by the owners of the bridge for foot and carriage passengers, however, in the
                     summer season, average over one hundred dollars per day, besides forty-five
                     thousand dollars per year paid by the Great Western Railway Company for their
                     cars passing over the upper story of the bridge. The toll of one hundred
                     dollars a day was principally received from visitors who came to see the falls
                     and the surrounding scenery, taking their pleasure rides in carriages to visit
                     the Canada side and to see and to cross this<pb n="314-315"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000158"/> noted bridge. Not more than one-fifth of the
                     amount of tolls was received from Canadian travel.</p>
                  <p>The building for the office of customs which I occupied, was so situated that
                     when the toll office and the bridge gates were closed, no footman could pass to
                     or from the bridge except by passing through the customs office. The gates were
                     closed about ten o'clock in the evening, after which there was very little
                     crossing. The watchman of the bridge on the Canada side, John or Michael,
                     collected the tolls from the few passengers which passed during the night. But
                     the customs officer at the American end held the United States keys of the door
                     and the gate, which made it necessary to disturb him before any one could pass
                     at that end of the bridge.</p>
                  <p>Such was the locality of my office building, situated so close to the roar of
                     Niagara, and at the mouth of so beautiful and wonderful a work of art; and this
                     together with the night scenery and the straggling characters which darted
                     through my office, interrupting my writing or my slumbers, created—shall I
                        say—<emph>occasions of surpassing interest!</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>For a number of miles either way, this was the only place of exit from one
                     country to the other, for stragglers, thieves and robbers, as well as belated
                     citizens and strangers.</p>
                  <p>In my own house, when at home, of course I fastened the doors and windows for
                     night, as everybody does; but what was the use of having such whimsical
                     notions, or being disturbed by such trifling events, in a room on the brink of
                     such a romantic river, where I had no one to defend but myself? What if four or
                     five robbers and house-breakers, with false keys and genuine pistols
                        <emph>should</emph> demand the silver watch I carried? Had I not a perfect
                        <emph>right</emph> in such case, as an officer, to pitch them headlong, all
                     five of them, twenty feet from my office, over the bank, two hundred and fifty
                     feet down into the Niagara rapids, and gaze on them as they were falling into
                     such a river by moonlight? And then had I not a right to go out on the bridge
                     free of toll to wait for another similar edition? or, to compose myself and
                     poetry, under the inspiration of such moonlight scenery, and such events! Or
                     had I not the right to start another slumber upon my office lounge, with the
                     United States keys in my pocket, while the river and its everlasting serenade
                     kept on!</p>
                  <p>It is a mistake, if any one think he could not learn to be studious or
                     occasionally take an hour's repose, in <emph>such</emph> an office, on
                        <emph>such</emph> a river, with a bridge of such "immense grace," and with
                     so <emph>little</emph> to disturb or make afraid, and so much to make
                     meditations and sleeping time interesting! In an office so full of incidents by
                     day, and where dreams were made of little realities by night, why could not any
                     one stay there occasionally o'nights to study and write, and serve their
                     country, and draw their pay?</p>
                  <p>Among the specimens of criminal-looking outcasts, which one could hardly fancy
                     might be found in prison or out—or frightened across any frontier—was a pair of
                     human beings, male and female, who came through my office from Canada, two
                     hours after midnight, in the spring of 1867. You could not imagine a bad
                     quality nor any mixture of sin, poverty and ignorance and misfortune<pb
                        n="316-317" xml:id="VAC6367-00000159"/> fortune which, had not, to all
                     appearance, overtaken them, even to the misfortune of the man having found a
                     woman that "matched" him! Whisky had given them the same red eyes, and
                     continued dissipation the same shade of complexion over the same ground-work of
                     tan and exposure. They looked alike, were each of medium size, and evidently
                     had fought alike, and drank alike, for I declare to you, without exaggeration,
                     that the face and eyes of each appeared to be, as nearly as possible, marked
                        <emph>alike</emph> by blows and scratches! Besides all this, there was an
                     expression of face which told me more than I could repeat in words—a look of
                     nothing good and a mixture of everything bad; all of which corresponded with
                     the time and place of their serious flight and their sudden appearance before
                     me. The pair, representing both sexes as they did, suggested some lower order
                     of human beings, or else a return-sample from perdition; for the moment they
                     had passed through my office, I said to myself, with a smile I could not
                     suppress: "There goes the devil and his wife, sure!" They were, evidently, too
                     desirous of escaping from Canada to have any present object but safety to
                     themselves.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The Preacher's Brandy—Strange Companions—Mr.
                     O'Flinigan—Astonishing Figures—The Unfortunate Widow—Custom-House Laws—Two
                     Puzzling Questions—When are Household Goods and Tools of Trade free of
                     duty.</head>
                  <p>"WE have to inspect baggage, here, sir, on account of customs," said I to a
                     well-dressed man, who walked by my office evidently with no thought of noticing
                     custom-house regulations.</p>
                  <p>"Well," he replied, "I am in something of a hurry; do you have to require us to
                     open such little things as a satchel which travelers carry just a change of
                     clothing in?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir, that is the rule here, but we give as little trouble as possible in
                     doing our duty."</p>
                  <p>He began opening his satchel, but manifested his hurry in such a polite and
                     civil way, and asking about the departure of trains that I felt reluctant to
                     delay him; but I had lost so much faith in appearances that I preferred
                     positive evidence when convenient. Whether his hurry was genuine, or simply to
                     give me an opportunity to be so obliging that I would only examine the top of
                     his traveling-bag as he opened it, was a question which appearances did not
                     positively decide. In such a case the remedy was evident—I must examine a
                     little below the surface, which I did, and felt a large package half filling
                     the satchel. "What is this?" said I.</p>
                  <p>"Why, you don't charge duty on just one book—a Bible—even if it is a large,
                     nice book, do you?"</p>
                  <pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC6367-00000160"/>
                  <p>"But what is this, in these two bottles below the Bible, sir?"</p>
                  <p>"O, yes; I forgot to report them. My family are a little out of health; and I
                     was told that the Canada brandy is a purer article than I could find upon our
                     side of the river. But if there be any duty to pay on that or the book either,
                     of course I'm willing to pay it."</p>
                  <p>"As to the brandy, sir, it is against the law to bring it into the country,
                     even if you did report it, except you had a full case to pay duty on."</p>
                  <p>"Possible, sir? I did not know it."</p>
                  <p>"Then it seems a little queer that you did not report these odd companions—a
                     new Bible and two bottles of brandy—before I reached the stage which I have in
                     searching your baggage."</p>
                  <p>"Really, Mr. Officer, I was not aware of the importance of my doing so. I did
                     not know that <emph>nations</emph> took notice of such small matters. Had I
                     known it, I certainly would have been more mindful."</p>
                  <p>"We are expected to be very particular at this point, sir, I admit; but, from
                     your manner, stranger, I presume you intended nothing wrong; yet, to an officer
                     of customs here, where deception is so variously attempted, you will see that
                     innocent circumstances sometimes appear very suspicious, and sometimes, as in
                     this case, a little mixed. This Bible, for instance—an expensive one,
                        too—<emph>indicates</emph> that you are a man of good intentions—perhaps a
                     preacher, and yet two bottles of brandy, and your neglecting to report, do tend
                     to confuse the question! and, besides, very good people on the frontier here,
                        <emph>will</emph> smuggle 'for their own use,' or some other excuse."</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Officer, this seems stranger than it really is. I am a clergyman, it is
                     true, but other men buy Bibles also. And, as for the brandy, why, we are all
                     liable to sickness!"</p>
                  <p>And now for the particular information of a certain government officer who used
                     to call around as a kind of detective to watch other officers, and local
                     matters which he did not, and of, course could not understand, as well as
                     officers living in the locality, and consequently who used to criticise the
                     discretionary little acts which officers did or did not do, I will here most
                     positively state that <emph>perhaps</emph> I passed that, new Bible and the
                     bottles! At any rate the preacher departed in due time for the cars and in good
                     humor.</p>
                  <p>I had scarcely taken a seat at my writing-desk when a man whom I barely
                     recognized as a resident of the town approached me with that peculiar privilege
                     which some men take. If you were busy with accounts they would approach you,
                     and leaning one hand upon your shoulder and the other upon your desk, would go
                     into a low, confidential whisper, as if <emph>your</emph> time was worthless,
                     and their business a friendship to eat you up; and, as if you certainly must
                     know them because they had seen you before. If you fail to recognize them they
                     will tell you who they are, where they saw you, and proceed to make your
                     acquaintance, by telling that which has no interest to any one but themselves,
                     and when you finally find out the single question they wanted to ask, you have
                     heard also a history of their grandmother!</p>
                  <p>Well, the instant this man approached me as aforesaid,<pb n="320-321"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000161"/> one hand on my shoulder, the other on my desk,
                     he placed his face so near my own that his disagreeable breath forced me to
                     move backward, first simply moving my head; but this he did not notice, and
                     continued to whisper something about "hams and bacon and a little whisky for
                     his own use," when I made another retreating move of my face, which he seemed
                     to take as another attitude for listening; and his disagreeable tobacco breath
                     still reached my olfactories. By the time he had reached the subject of duties,
                     his breath, a slight mixture of whisky with a strong scent of tobacco,
                     compelled me to make a third retreat by hitching my <emph>chair</emph>
                     backward. Finally I was driven to beg his pardon for being obliged to tell him
                     to stand back like a gentleman and tell me what he wanted. My olfactories were
                     too good and my politeness too little to endure longer such a mixture of
                     whisky, tobacco and impudence.</p>
                  <p>The hints of my retreating movements had made no impression on him; and the
                     severity of my last rebuke was only sufficient to make him stand up at a proper
                     distance for conversation. He neither apologized nor took offense. He did seem
                     a little "confused," but none too much "set back!"</p>
                  <p>He continued to talk of smoked hams and bacon—how he had been "wondering" for
                     some time if he hadn't better come down and see me, and see if he couldn't make
                     some "<emph>arrangement</emph>" so I would not charge him so much duty; and to
                     see what I knew about the prices in Canada, and if I didn't think it would pay
                     better than to buy hams at the groceries on our side of the river, etc.,
                     etc.</p>
                  <p>"Is it the <emph>duty</emph> on hams and bacon you wish me to inform you about,
                     sir?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir, that is it, exactly! I thought, your honor, if I knew the duties you
                     would ax me I could tell if it would be cheaper for me to buy them on the other
                     side."</p>
                  <p>And without waiting for me to tell him the duties, he branched off again about
                     the grocerymen here, that "wouldn't trust a man till Saturday night! an' it's
                     never a cindy that Pat O'Flinigan ever chated thin yet, ather," said he.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. O'Flinigan, if you are ready to hear it, sir, the duty on smoked ham and
                     bacon is two cents per pound, and all duties over five dollars are to be paid
                     in gold; if under five, they may be paid in silver."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I see," said Mr. O'Flinigan, reflectively, "but may be I shall not buy
                     any. I thought I'd ax you to see about it. Couldn't you let me bring over a
                     small keg of whisky and a few hams without any duty? Come, now, and I can give
                     you a dollar for your own pocket!"</p>
                  <p>"I guess you don't know me, Mr. O'Flinigan."</p>
                  <p>"O, indade I do, Mr. Officer, and I'm the man that intends to vote for
                     you."</p>
                  <p>"Mr. O'Flinigan, I cannot give you any opportunity to smuggle!"</p>
                  <p>"O, well, now, niver mind a little joking! Of course you know I wouldn't chate
                     the government out of a cint. An' I wouldn't smuggle the laste of anything
                        <emph>without your permission!</emph> But I tuk a thought that may be you
                     would think it an act of charity to a poor man like meself to get over a small
                     load of sich things for meself<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC6367-00000162"/> and a
                     few others; an' I always tuk you to be a charitable man, Mr. Officer, indade I
                     did. What do you <emph>say</emph> now? It's just as I tell you; everything is
                     too dear on this side of the river, an' I've got a large family to
                     support."</p>
                  <p>"I'm sorry for your misfortunes, Mr. O'Flinigan, but I cannot aid you in
                     breaking the laws!"</p>
                  <p>"But it's not for meself I'd ask it; an' what's a poor man to do in this
                     country if he can't get enough for his family to ate?"</p>
                  <p>"Mr. O'Flinigan, will you take it kindly if I will tell you of a better
                     speculation than for you to smuggle? and tell how you have lost a comfortable
                     house and lot, and can get it back again?"</p>
                  <p>"I'm sure you can't tell me <emph>that,</emph> now, for I niver had a house and
                     lot to lose!"</p>
                  <p>"Well, sir, how much a day do you waste for grog and tobacco? Be honest now and
                     we'll figure up."</p>
                  <p>"O, it's <emph>that</emph> you mane! Of course, now, your honor, I wouldn't be
                     irriverant, but I wish ye'd let the timperance question alone, and jest do me
                     the favor I'm askin', if ye plase! Indade it's jokin' to talk about the thrifle
                     I've iver spint for whisky, or tobacco, ather! An' ye sees I've had the good
                     on't for the thrifle its cost me."</p>
                  <p>"Mr. O'Flinigan, you must be about fifty, and you would be astonished should I
                     show that you have spent two thousand dollars that way."</p>
                  <p>"Indade I should, for I niver had the half of that in all me life!"</p>
                  <p>"Well, now, Mr. O'Flinigan, has it cost you three cents a day since you were
                     twenty years of age, for tobacco?"</p>
                  <p>"May be it has, now, that little!"</p>
                  <p>"That, sir, is just $10.95 a year, $109.05 for ten years, and $327.15 for
                     thirty years."</p>
                  <p>"Indade, now, that is more than I thought it was for tobacco—it
                        <emph>is,</emph> now."</p>
                  <p>"But, wait, Mr. O'Flinigan; we have not reckoned the yearly interest on what
                     you have spent, which, at seven per cent, for thirty years, would make $327
                     amount to a little over $1200 for your tobacco, and if you have also spent on
                     an average three cents a day for whisky, that is $1200 more, and altogether
                     $2400!"</p>
                  <p>"Faith, now, an' its 'asier to pr'ache than to practice! an' even if your
                     figures are right, it's too late to save it <emph>now!</emph> I always
                     riveranced Father Mathew an' the timperance question, but it's not asy to
                     foller the best o' pr'achin'."</p>
                  <p>"If you once get rid of the habits you will find it easier than being a slave
                     to them! besides the comforts saved to yourself and family!"</p>
                  <p>"Indade, now, Mr. Officer, you are a strange man for a <emph>politician,</emph>
                     to talk as if ye niver take a '<emph>social glass,</emph>' nor <emph>trate the
                        friends that vote ye into office!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>Here my conversation with Mr. O'Flinigan was interrupted by other duties. A
                     woman called to inquire if she could move with her household goods into the
                     States from Canada without being required to pay duty.</p>
                  <p>I informed her that the law allowed household goods and tools of trade to be
                     brought into the country free of duty, if they had been in use one year, and
                     were not intended for sale.</p>
                  <pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6367-00000163"/>
                  <p>"Nearly everything we had," said she, "has been burned up, as well as the house
                     we lived in; and, in trying to save our only child from the flames, my poor
                     husband lost his life. And I am trying to get back home. It is not quite a year
                     since we bought these household goods in Canada. Will I have to pay duty if it
                     is not quite a year?"</p>
                  <p>"Madam, what is the value of the goods you wish to bring?"</p>
                  <p>"Not more than fifty dollars' worth. That is all there was saved from the fire,
                     except the carpenter's tools my husband worked with. I have no money to pay
                     duty on goods nor on the tools."</p>
                  <p>Both questions puzzled me. The law, strictly to the letter, required that duty
                     should be paid on the household goods, because they had not been in use
                        <emph>one year;</emph> and, yet it seemed I ought to take a liberal view of
                     this case, under the circumstances. Then as to the "tools of trade" which the
                     law allowed a person to bring into the country "for use" and "not for sale,"
                     what was I to say about that? It was not likely that a <emph>woman</emph> was
                     bringing <emph>carpenter's</emph> tools into the country with the intention of
                     using them, but more likely with the intention of disposing of them at some
                     future favorable opportunity. And yet, ought I to charge duty upon the effects
                     of this poor, unfortunate woman, when I could have passed the same "tools of
                     trade" <emph>free of duty for her husband,</emph> in case he had lived to have
                     moved here with her?</p>
                  <p>Well, reader, what would you have decided on these points? If you could have
                     construed the law, or "the spirit of the law" in favor of such poverty,
                     misfortune and grief, you would have done so. Perhaps <emph>I</emph> did.
                     Perhaps I believed that my superiors in office were sensible enough not to
                     censure my course in any case till they gave me opportunity to show all the
                     particulars.</p>

                  <p>EVERY few days there crossed this frontier a company of hardy-looking
                     foreigners, bound for the Western lands of the United States. Most of them
                     crossed the bridge in the cars, but it happened very often that as many as
                     twenty-five to fifty families, with all the hand-baggage of bundles, babies and
                     boxes which they could carry, passed on foot, having gotten off the cars to see
                     the place, and to buy bread, supplies of which were kept for sale by Germans of
                     the village. I noticed that these foreigners looked economical, but never
                     ragged or shiftless. They were dressed comfortably well, but plain; the women
                     all seemed to despise the folly of fashion's extravagance. In warm weather,
                     unlike American women, they seemed to have no troublesome fears about
                     "tanning," no anxiety about complexion. Many were entirely bareheaded; and the
                     twenty-five cent head-fixtures which some of them<pb n="326-327"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000164"/> wore it was impossible for even a Yankee to
                     invent or discover a reason for. Whenever these cheap head fixtures, however,
                     were thick enough to warrant the conclusion, I took my Yankee privilege of
                     "guessing" that their use was a protection against burdens which they might
                     find it convenient to carry upon their heads after the fashion of the Swiss;
                     and then I conjectured that the light fixtures were a mere style which had
                     descended from the useful to the unornamental and useless. An American lady
                     frequently wears what is equally useless and just as unbecoming, but takes good
                     care to have it cost a little extravagantly, so that her servant girl cannot
                     afford the same.</p>
                  <p>Although these hardy German women scemed able to endure hardships and
                     inconveniences, I saw nothing in their costumes of such useless bulk as a
                     lady's waterfall of 1866. Either from pride or some other reason, they were
                     traveling without that mysterious material bound to the back of their heads!
                     Although emigrants who have traveled three thousand miles are not always noted
                     for their tidy appearance, yet I never saw one of these women wearing a street
                     dress of such length as to drag the dust around her feet. It seemed as if the
                     dress of a German woman was made to wear. They seemed also to have adopted the
                     principle of "woman's rights." They acted like men; took the right to carry
                     their own baggage like the men, and so far as I could observe, they seemed to
                     expect and receive no more attention or favors from the men than the men
                     bestowed upon each other. It was a singular fact that of the numerous crowds of
                     emigrants crossing this bridge and pressing their way Westward, nearly all were
                     Germans.</p>
                  <p>But here now is an exciting day at Niagara Falls. An excursion party of
                     hundreds of Canadians have arrived, and another of Americans. They have just
                     left the cars and are crossing the bridge on foot in long, crowded lines. And
                     in order to view the bridge, the falls and the rapids to advantage, they pass
                     one way upon the lower floor and return on the upper floor, on either side of
                     the railroad track, and ascend or descend by the winding stairs at either end
                     of the bridge.</p>
                  <p>As these crowds leave the bridge they are talkative, but as they approach it
                     they are silent with wonder and admiration. If the excursion is an intelligent
                     picnic party, it is safe to declare that while they first gaze on the scene
                     before them none are thinking of sponge-cake or pickles and sandwiches. But
                     here they are coming from Canada, and I must inspect their baggage. Stop a
                     moment. You are laughing at my inconsistency, and perhaps you are saying,
                        <emph>verily</emph> the author of these reminiscences <emph>must</emph> be
                     writing under difficulties to talk about inspecting the luggage of a picnic
                     party!</p>
                  <p>But, dear critic, I assure you upon my honor, that of all the baggage from
                     trunk to bandbox or basket that passed my office, that of a picnic party was
                     the most delicious for inspection. And by the proper tact at turning my duty
                     into a humorous examination, I found offense was seldom taken; and often I was
                     invited to know by actual inspection whether the contents would bear the
                     praises I had bestowed upon their delicious<pb n="328-329"
                        xml:id="VAC6367-00000165"/> appearance. For of course I always lavished on
                     them the usual compliment that the fruit, which I suspected had grown in their
                     own orchards, or the frosted cake made in their own kitchens, was the
                        "<emph>nicest I ever saw.</emph>" I confess I met with poor success in
                     convincing some people crossing with the picnickers of my authority for, or the
                     propriety of inspecting the contents of huge baskets or hand-satchels, when
                        <emph>they</emph> knew so well that their luggage contained only fruit, and
                     frosted cake. But generally I succeeded in convincing the most obtuse
                     individual that no customs officer with ordinary human eyes by only looking on
                     the outside of an opake bundle, basket or traveling-bag, could see the contents
                     of the same; and if a custom-house officer was bound to prevent smuggling by
                     inspecting <emph>any</emph> baggage, it was his duty to prevent any smuggler
                     from taking such an opportunity to bring a huge basket full of kid gloves into
                     the United States, instead of sandwiches. A silk dress pattern that might be
                     carried in a satchel would have cost at that time (1866) fifty dollars in gold,
                     and was liable to a duty of sixty per cent; hence it was not too small a matter
                     to save thirty dollars in gold for the government, whose war to put down the
                     rebellion had left our country in debt twenty-five hundred millions of
                     dollars!</p>
                  <p>But there were times when there was no time to reply to the angry comments of
                     now and then a person in a crowd of footmen and carriages who had never before
                     passed a custom-house office. At such a time and with those who neither
                     understood nor admired the inquisitive duty of a customs officer, the only
                     remedy to prevent contention and yet dispatch, business, was to assume the
                     authority of an officer in a manner that implied duty and business! but
                     discriminating, of course, according to the apparent intelligence of the person
                     addressed, that he might not mistake duty and dispatch to go away and report
                     that the officer's manner was worse than his duty.</p>
                  <p>The few frontier residents who crossed this bridge in carriages, generally
                     intended to return the same day; sometimes not until two or three days; and it
                     would have been a very great inconvenience to the people living near the line
                     of the two countries if the officers of customs for both countries were not
                     permitted to use their discretion in allowing people to drive into the country
                     without payment of duty for a few hours or longer, on a visit, or on business,
                     in cases where the officer had reason to believe the parties were honest and
                     would return their conveyances. This to some extent was done; in which cases
                     the name and a description of the horses and vehicles were recorded in a book
                     kept for such purposes by the officer, and the parties were required to return
                     and report the same at some specified time. They were informed that if they did
                     not report within the required time that their conveyance would be liable to
                     seizure.</p>
                  <p>In cases where the officer did not feel satisfied to trust persons, as in the
                     case of entire strangers, who could give no satisfactory references, they were
                     sometimes permitted to deposit the amount of duties as security, and on their
                     returning the dutiable property to Canada the money was refunded. Persons
                     driving through Canada, from "the States," especially, had to make this
                        arrangement<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC6367-00000166"/> ment with the
                     Canadian custom-house officers. They drew back the amount left as security, at
                     the port where they went out of Canada. But all this would not clear them from
                     other difficulties unless before entering Canada they had taken an "export
                     certificate" of their dutiable property from the United States custom house, to
                     show to the United States officer at the port where they again entered the
                     States.</p>
                  <p>Well, here comes a horse and buggy from the Canada side. There are two persons
                     in the old, open buggy. One is a surly, thin-visaged, cross-looking old
                     gentleman; his face is red, and with other indications, it is evident he has a
                     habit of drinking too much whisky; his hat belongs to the stove-pipe style, and
                     was probably once new. If this should become a matter of any importance to know
                     in evidence, I have no doubt but our old customhouse detective or the chief of
                     the Niagara police, could determine the probable time when he purchased it by a
                     calculation based on facts and supposition. As near as I can myself make out
                     the date, without making a drawing of the hat and consulting a professional
                     hatter, I should say the style was one in vogue seven years prior to the time
                     now under consideration, and that the miserly appearing old man, looking his
                     red eyes from under its brim, had bought it one year out of date that he might
                     be able to spend the amount saved thereby in whisky. The width of his coat
                     collar indicates also that it was about that time that he treated himself to a
                     new suit of clothes; but since that time he had probably treated himself to
                     other "treats" which he much preferred, and of a kind suggested by his
                     strawberry nose. His whiskers are so gray that they are almost white, except
                     where some late stains of tobacco-juice have asserted claims over other hair
                     dyes for superior hue and neatness! His shirt-collar, though not of the most
                     approved pattern, is clean and well ironed, as if the neat, plain, care-worn
                     woman by his side, frail as she is, is the faithful wife, <emph>struggling to
                        keep alive the last spark of her husband's self-respect.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>He is evidently sober now, but it is more evident that he prefers to be
                     otherwise. He is restless, disagreeable and unreasonable, and all this and more
                     you read at a glance as he stops and hands his ticket for crossing the bridge
                     to the gate-keeper, and swears at the weather for its prospect of rain.</p>
                  <p>There is a crowd of ladies and gentlemen waiting for him to pass the toll
                     office. And as he is a stranger, I am waiting his report to the customs office.
                     His wife, in a low whisper, seems to have gently attempted to check him from
                     swearing "before all these people," and then in a savage undertone I hear him
                        <emph>curse her!</emph> and the <emph>crowd,</emph> too!</p>
                  <p>But now he is starting up his horse with another curse and a blow from his
                     cudgel. And it is time for me to inquire <emph>if he wishes to make any report
                        to the custom house,</emph> for he evidently has no intention of making any
                     report. But it is in this way I prefer to call this crabbed, old man's
                     attention. This will only seem, to suggest that as he has fully passed my
                     office door he is probably mistaking <emph>where</emph> to make his intended
                     report. Of course a<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC6367-00000167"/> man of his
                     morbid sensitiveness, which, I have already discovered, will not well "bear to
                     have me speak in any manner which he can construe as implying ignorance of
                     custom-house rules! In fact, such men don't like the use of <emph>any</emph>
                     terms that can possibly remind them of any of their numerous faults.</p>
                  <p>So I said (for while in my office room I was in easy talking distance,) "here,
                     sir, is where you report to the custom house."</p>
                  <p>He halted, as if half-surprised, and in a coarse, angry voice replied:</p>
                  <p>"Well, what of it, if it is? <emph>I</emph> don't have to make any report."</p>
                  <p>"You are a stranger to me, sir, but I suppose your horse and wagon belongs on
                     the Canada side?"</p>
                  <p>"Of course it does," he replied, "and what odds does that make, when I'm only
                     coming over here on a visit, and am going to take it back again when I get
                     ready! Or, do you take me for a cussed <emph>smuggler?</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"My friend," said I, "I suppose you must be aware that I ought not to allow
                        <emph>entire strangers</emph> to pass the customs office with dutiable
                     property, without knowing who they are, and when the property is to be returned
                     to Canada."</p>
                  <p>"Well, sir, my <emph>word</emph> is all you need!"</p>
                  <p>"But, perhaps," said I, "you can refer me to some person here who knows
                     you."</p>
                  <p>"I don't ask anybody to back my word, sir—<emph>not no man, sir!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"Are you going to return to Canada to-day?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, <emph>by mighty!</emph> you custom-house officers are getting cussed
                     particular over here in the States. But I know what your duties are as well as
                     you!"</p>
                  <p>"Then, of course, my dear sir, you will give me some reference, or state where
                     you wish to go, or when you wish to return this horse and buggy to Canada."</p>
                  <p>"Well, by mighty! I've lived within ten miles of this frontier for years, and
                     the United States is getting cussed impudent if we can't come over here without
                     all this fuss!"</p>
                  <p>Then while he went on to swear about things in general, his wife told me where
                     they were going; that they were only intending to call an hour or two on a
                     friend, and then go back. "It will be all right," said she, mildly.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, it's all right, of course," chimed in the old grumbler, "but it's
                        <emph>cussed</emph> impudent to bother an old man like me! Does he think I'm
                     a smuggler?"</p>
                  <p>"Never mind, husband, the man must do his duty."</p>
                  <p>"Well, what in <emph>cuss</emph> has that got to do with <emph>me?</emph> I'm
                     no <emph>smuggler.</emph> I wouldn't even <emph>sell</emph> as good a horse as
                     this is, to any such cussed country! for none o'their abolition greenbacks. Of
                        <emph>course</emph> I wouldn't."</p>
                  <p>On the word of his lady I decided to pass them; and addressing her I said:</p>
                  <p>"Madam, if you are only going to see Mr. A—— B——, at the —— hotel, and are to
                     return so soon, I will register this gentleman's name, if you please, and you
                     will please report when you return."</p>
                  <p>"What is the use," said the voice from under the stovepipe hat, "of such cussed
                     foolishness as <emph>that?</emph>"</p>
                  <pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC6367-00000168"/>
                  <p>"And the box, there," said I, "in your buggy, it is my duty to inspect
                     that."</p>
                  <p>"There, by mighty!" exclaimed the mouth under the strawberry nose as the
                     stove-pipe hat magnified an angry shake of the old man's head, "do you want to
                     examine a box of horse-feed because there is two or three dozen eggs in
                     it?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, husband, do let the man look into the box," said his wife, removing the
                     cover, "how can the officer know what may be in boxes without a chance to see
                     inside of them?"</p>
                  <p>Then, speaking to me, she said:</p>
                  <p>"We know we've no right to smuggle, but we thought custom houses don't notice
                     two or three shillings' worth of anything, so I put into this box just three
                     dozen eggs for a present. That's all right, isn't it?"</p>
                  <p>"Say, Mr. Officer," interrupted the old man, "are you going to let us pass or
                     not? or, are you going to keep us here a whole cussed <emph>hour,</emph> by
                     mighty!"</p>
                  <p>"I beg your pardon, sir, but is it I, or you, who are causing so many
                     unnecessary words?"</p>
                  <p>"It's you, sir, by being so cussed particular, <emph>I</emph> know what your
                     duty is. You've no business to inspect things and bother people this way, when
                     you know they are not smugglers."</p>
                  <p>"Stranger," said I, with forced calmness, "you are an older man than myself,
                     but allow me to inquire what business you follow?"</p>
                  <p>"Me? I've kept tavern thirty years within ten miles of here, and you've no
                     business to question me as if I were a smuggler."</p>
                  <p>"Do you trust your liquor to every stranger who swears he knows your business
                     better than you know it yourself? and would such course recommend him to
                        <emph>your</emph> favor?"</p>
                  <p>"Not by a mighty sight!"</p>
                  <p>"Why, then, should your course recommend you to my favor? But you may pass and
                     return to-day, sir. What is your name?"</p>
                  <p>"Smith, sir, Smith!"</p>
                  <p>"Any other name besides Smith, sir?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir, John Smith—John Smith's my name, sir!"</p>
                  <p>So I registered John Smith, at last, realizing that that name meant almost
                     anybody, but thought I could safely rely on <emph>his description!</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>Toward night John Smith, the aforesaid, of the stovepipe hat and strawberry
                     noise, tavern keeper, went back with same horse and buggy. John Smith nearer
                     the point, of being intoxicated, but better natured; from which it would appear
                     that being drunk was his most normal habit!</p>
                  <p>Let us hope that John Smith finally reformed, and that whatever was unseemly in
                     his manner, even so far as recorded here, will lead some reader to consider his
                     own doings or his own sayings. Let us hope, too, that life among all classes
                     will become at last so correct that no rough things need be pictured to lead
                     any to avoid in themselves what they criticise in others.</p>
