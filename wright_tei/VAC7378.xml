TO THE  READER. IN the following pages, the writer has endea- vored, as much as possible, to avoid the beaten track; but as the alphabet, words, and ideas are open and free to all, she has found it next to impossible to do so. But, whatever similarity to other writings may appear, the reader is assured that nothing has intentionally been copied without the quotation-marks. It is hopedithat the purely moral tendency of this work will give it a favorable passport to all classes, especially the reading, appreci- ating circles. Trusting it, with all its faults and errors, in their benevolent hands, she anxiously awaits their decision, by which it is to stand or fall.

THE OLD HOUSE. -UNCLE BEN AND AUNT NABBY.-OPEN- ING SCHOOL IN IRYEFIELD. - MAKING THE TOILET. IN an old, decayed, obscure building, in a country town not far from  the city of Boston, in a room which had every appear- ance of extreme poverty, sat an aged couple, who, to judge from appearances, had left "threescore and ten" far behind them on the track of life. Relentless Time had shown them no favors; but, on the contrary, had blighted their hopes, wasted their strength, withered their faces, frosted their hair, quenched their energies, and left them arrested, though not yet com- mitted, prisoners of Death. 2  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7378-00000010"/> "      WAIT AND SEE. This aged man, whose name was Benjamin Darley, together with his good wife Nabby (or rather Aunt Nabby, as she was always called), was "Uncle Ben" to everybody; so that not a man, woman, or child, for miles around, but could readily inform you where Uncle Ben and Aunt Nabby lived. The old house where they staid (it could scarcely be called living) at the time of-our story had been their home for more than fifty years, - even their whole wedded life. It had descended from sire to son for several generations, until it had become, like its occu- pants, so tottering and shabby, that even rats were ashamed to be seen there, and only staid as a matter of convenience. The ground belonging to this old building, though but a few acres, had once been highly cultivated, and tended with such care and skill, that its product of nice vegetables, deli- cious fruit, and beautiful flowers, was really delightful: indeed, it was a perfect little Eden. When they were both younger, and able to   WAIT AND SEE.      15 work, they rose with the lark, and were almost as blithe and happy. Hope, like a bright, beautiful- summer's morning, lay spread out before them: it was their morning of life. Healthful and hopeful, they travelled hand in hand through their long summer s day; when evening calmly awaited their approach to introduce them into the coming night which closes the longest and brightest day. There had once been a time when they were not desolate. Five blooming, healthy children were their richest blessings, - the delight of their hearts and the love-light of their existence. The two oldest were sons, named Alfred and Ezra. The three young- est were daughters, called Mary, Anna, and' Lizzie. Lizzie was the petted lamb of the flock, being very beautiful, and their youngest darling. Nearly all families have one such idol, which they set up as the " golden image," before whom all creation is expected, by the adoring parents, to "fall down and wor- ship." Years passed on, while this contented, happy  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7378-00000011"/> 16      WAIT AND SEE. couple were scarcely conscious of the flight of time, so cheerfully had they jogged on in their journey of life. Uncle Ben was a tall, healthy, fine-looking man, with a calm, sedate coun- tenance. Aunt Nabby was a short, plump- looking woman,- with a full, round face, with an expression of shrewdness, mixed with a dash of kindness and good nature, which ren- dered it quite good-looking and agreeable. Her hair, which was dark brown, was parted with such precision, and carried back so tight behind her ears, that it made her head look very sleek, hard, and round. Her dress, in summer, was a black and white linsey-woolsey skirt, with blue and white striped short-gown; blue and white " four and four" checked apron; with copperas and white-checked handkerchief, which was always pinned with the greatest care and exactness around her chubby neck, but not close enough to conceal her gold beads. N- To haste ever made her forget to attend to that. And why should it? Those beads were a present for her name.  Her stockings, which were visible an inch or two   WAIT AND SEE.      17 above the heel of her calfskin shoes, were home-dyed blue, of her own spinning and knitting. Uncle Ben, in warm weather, wore tow- cloth trousers, without coat or vest: in winter, "sheep's gray" woollen, trimmed with pewter buttons; stockings of the same color;, with cowhide shoes, and large pewter buckles, but he did not see fit to " change them every day " dike good old Grimes). He was very careful and neat, and was never known but once to enter the house without wiping his feet on the mat; and then he was nearly distracted with the toothache. Aunt Nabby made him go right back and wipe them, that he might not. contract a slovenly habit. Indeed, every thing about the house was perfect order and neat- ness. Every child, even to the youngest, knew   that nothing must be put out of place, or any thing spilt,.or crums dropped. Ah! Aunt Nabby was fire-neat: it was, at that time, the only drawhack on her hap- piness. But other troubles, of a more serious nature, 2*  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7378-00000012"/> 18      WAIT AND SEE. were rapidly approaching; for which, too, they were not prepared. For, though good, honest people, they had never troubled their heads about the great concerns of death and a future life. True, Uncle Ben read- the Bible every sabbath, as in duty bound: and some- times they went to church, when nothing stood in the way of it; but thought the preacher "had a dreadful easy time of it." They could not fathom the mystery of his expecting pay for telling them that they were sinners; c" as ef they didn't know it- afore." They thought it " a great piece of ill manners, ef he was a parson." Besides, Aunt Nabby declared, for one, that she "would not fret herself about that which might never happen, arter all. And as for the sin of Adam and Eve, ef ever there was any sich thing, it was so long ago, and so fur off, she didn't b'lieve it would ever do them the leastest bit of harm, or anybody else that worked as hard as they did, and minded their own business, and let sich on- sartin things alone." The first lessons taught their children were   WAIT AND SEE.      19 industry and order: two very good things. Every one, old enough to labor, had their allotted tasks, according to their ability and strength. The three oldest children had the promise of going to Mrs. Dorset's school when it commenced, if they would rise very early every morning without being urged, and work "right smart" till school-time.  This they gladly promised and cheerfully performed; for the hope of going to school made every task easy and- light. The long-looked-for Monday morning at length arrived when the school was to com- mence. At just half an hour before school- time, the children were called in to undergo a thorough, faithful scrubbing from a large iron skillet which stood on the kitchen hearth; for Aunt Nabby said she "would have no faces and hands washed in the sink, where she washed the dishes: it was too ontidy." A piggin of soft-soap was standing near; and a large lump of lard, ready for use, rested on the andiron. Aunt Nabby now commenced operations in good earnest. With a coarse  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7378-00000013"/> 20      TWAIT AND SEE. cloth, dipped first in the soft-soap, and then in the skillet of water, she began scouring faces in a manner that showed she intended that justice should be done; never heeding the trifling obstacles of eyes, noses, and mouths, or the shrill, sharp cry of " O mamma! don't: you hurt me dreadfully!" AWhen she had completed the ablutions, to her entire satisfaction, of all three, she com- menced combing the hair of the boys, using lard most lavishy dard was a less expensive article at that time than at the present). Then their clean garments were donned; and with much sage advice respecting their behavior, using their pocket- handkerchiefs, &amp;c., she bade them set out for school. Mary's toilet was somewhat more tardy in its progress. Her hair received the remains of the lard, which was extremely plentiful. It was then braided back very tight; which made her wince and writhe in such a manner, that Aunt Nabby was obliged to point to a bunch of birch-rods, which were tied together, lying on the mantel-piece, and ask if she would   WAIT AND SEE.      21 like to have them taken down. This hint was sufficient. Mary now stood quietly until the braiding was completed.  One large braid hung down her back, tied with blue thread. Her best slip was put on for the first day of school. When she was ready, Uncle Ben, who was going directly by the schoolhouse to the mill, undertook, to take her to school, with the heavy bag of corn on his back.  He felt quite pleased, and even proud, to see his little Molly look so nice and trim, and to think how happy it would make him to see his children all well " edicated." He rapped at the door of the schoolroom with his heavy knuckles, which soon brought Mrs. Dorset in person to the door. "How d'ye do, marm?" said he. "My little gal here has never bin to school afore. I'm a little afeard she will be trouble- some at fust." "Oh! never fear, Mr. Darley.  She'll soon get acquainted, and like to come, I dare say." "I hope so," replied Uncle Ben, looking  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7378-00000014"/> 22      WAIT AND SEE. quite encouraged. "The boys, Alfred and Ezra, are both here, I suppose." "They are, Mr. Darley; and fine, intelli- gent-looking boys they are too. I doubt not, they will make excellent scholars. And so will little Mary here. You will try, will you not, my dear?" " eth, ma'am." "Your children's ages, Mr. Darley?" "Alfred, I think, is about twelve years of age, - yes, twelve last January; Ezra, ten last September; and Mary was eight last Monday. I hope you will do your best for 'em, Mrs. Dorset, and not let 'em be idle nor heedless; for I want my children to hev larn- in', and not feel the want of it as I du." "I shall show them every attention and every kindness in my power, Mr. Darley: you may depend on that." "Oh! thankee a thousand times over. Good-day, marm!" "Good-morning, Mr. Darley!" replied Mrs. Dorset, and returned to the schoolroom, with a tear of memory in her eye, to marshal her   WAIT AND SEE.     23 little flock; while Uncle Ben trudged on towards the mill, whistling a lively march, with a buoyant and happy heart, at peace with itself and all mankind.  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7378-00000015"/> 24. CHAPTER II. MRS. DORSET'S HSTORY.-THE HEART'S IDOLATRY.-TIIE "OST CHLD.-A TRAGIC SCENE. IMRS. DORSET was a very lovely, pious woman, on the sunny side of thirty; of middle height and stature. Hers was the " soul of beau- ty," and therefore indescribable, farther than that her face was oval; complexion fair, but pale; dark, soft eyes; dark eyebrows, rather straight than arched; perfectly Grecian nose; and delicately chiselled lips, very full, and of a bri ght color. When she smiled, her teeth were just visible, and very small, white, and even. Indeed, her whole face was one of rare expression and beauty. Her voice was rich, silvery, and sweet. Her hair was abundant, and of a fair brown; very fine and soft. But (what we are going to say now must be in perfect confidence) there were troublesome intruders, of the wrong color, in that beautiful   W AIT AND SEE.      25 hair; and once little Mary Darley, making her best courtesy, said, "Pleathe, Mrs. Dorthet, I thee a white hair in your head!" But this artless observation of the child did not vex or embarrass her in the least. The only notice she took of it was a quiet "Never mind, dear: I knew it was there." The time had been when it would have pained her severely to have had such an unwelcome messenger announced; but she had since passed through the furnace, which had de- stroyed every unhallowed feeling. She had laid her soul on the altar of Jehovah, and it was the purifying influence of the baptism of fire' that had brought her to the sacrifice. Mrs. Dorset was the only child of wealthy and honorable parents in the city of Boston. She had received every advantage of education and refined society that such a position could confer. But no trait of haughtiness, vanity, or coquetry, ever marred that pure, stainless character; for Alexa Winthrop was, in person and mind, all that is lovely in woman. At the early age of seventeen, she bestowed 3  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7378-00000016"/> 26      WAIT AND SEE. her hand where her heart had long been given. William Dorset, a worthy, talented young man, had succeeded in winning the glorious prize so often and so ardently sought by many others. Fate and the lady's affections declared in favor of Dorset, proclaiming him to be the happy man. They were married; and a very happy union it proved for a few short years. But, alas! how fleeting and transitory are all earthly enjoyments! The beginning of their sorrows was the early loss of their first bud of promise. This, for a while, caused them deep sorrow; for he was very lovely. And to be cropped from the parent stern so early! Yet the bereaved parents dared not say, "Too soon." But, after the lapse of a few years, this sorrow, though never to be forgotten, was be-, coming dim in the distance. Another lovely babe had blessed their longing arms, and took full possession of their hearts. Little Effie was beautiful and lovely as a cherub. No wonder, then, that the. fond parents loved her with all   WAIT AND SEE.      27 the tenderness and affection of their whole hearts. This little idol had become their household deity, and left no place in their souls for higher worship. She had now taken a stand, from which an all-wise and "jealous God" saw fit to remove her, and to remind the sinning parents of his holy mandate, - "Thou shalt have no god but me."  This lovely little prattler was now about three years of age, trotting round after any of the house- hold with "Effie love oo: let me go wid oo." "Do you not love mamma too, Effie? Will you go away and leave her?" "Love mamma, love papa, love ev'ybody; love Dod too.- Please, let me go with my Sally, and dit some o' at pretty mud, mamma." The fond mother gave a reluctant consent, for she found it impossible to cross " the dar- ling;" and Sally, the little nursery-girl, whose business it was to wait on Miss Effie and amuse her, under the direction of the older nursery-maid, promised to be careful " if the mistress would let Miss Effie go." So she was suffered to take the child out, for the first  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7378-00000017"/> 28      RWAIT AND SEE. time, alone. Mrs. Dorset followed the beauti- ful creature with her eyes, feeling that pride which even a Christian mother sometimes in- dulges, and which was so soon to be humbled in the dust. Visitors being announced, Mrs. Dorset turned her attention to them; and, in animated and interesting conversation, the hours passed off imperceptibly, until one of the ladies expressed a desire to see the " pet of the world," as she styled little Effie. Mrs. Dorset rang. A waiter appeared. "Tell Amey to bring Miss Effie." Amey soon appeared, looking very pale and frightened. "I Amey! where is my child?" exclaimed Mrs. Dorset, in the greatest consternation at the pale, apprehensive look of the nursery- maid, and the recollection of her being taken out by Sally more than two hours before. "Have you not seen them? have they not returned?" cried Mrs. Dorset, pale as marble, and leaning against the wall for support. "No, Mrs. Dorset: I have not!" "Oh! where are they?"The mother was in   WAIT- AND SEE.      29 a perfect agony. "Oh! my child, my child!" she almost shrieked. The visitors begged her to compose herself; that, no doubt, as the afternoon was very fine, the child was loath to come back, and that the girl had probably been tempted to stay for her own amusement also; that they could see no just cause of alarm, as it was not very late. "Which way did they go?" asked one. A servant replied, that he saw Miss Effie's carriage, drawn by Sally, when they left the mansion, going towards the Common. "Go! fly!" cried the frightened mother; "and, if they are not there, inquire; and- O Heaven! - look everywhere.  Go to the counting-room! find my husband and my father! Oh, find her!" The rest of the household were despatched in all directions. The visitors all went in search, except two elderly ladies, relatives, who staid by the mother, who wrung her hands, and walked the rooms, in a fearful agony of suspense, for nearly an hour; when a servant returned to inform Mrs. Dorset 3*  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7378-00000018"/> 30      WAIT AND SEE. that they could not see or hear from them, but that Mr. Dorset and her father were searching the city with a great many men, and had offered a large reward to the person who found them first. "They bade me tell you, madam, to keep as calm as you possibly can; that they cannot have gone far, and must be found: it cannot be otherwise." In about an hour after this, Mr. Dorset rushed into the room, as pale as death, and sank on the first chair. Her trembling heart read the sad "No!" in his face. Both were speechless, and nearly paralyzed with the intensity of their grief. Neither of them could weep, or shed one tear: they stood locked in each other's arms in mute despair. Directly Capt. Winthrop (Mrs. Dorset's father) came in. He tried to be calm, - to hold out the encouragement to them which he could not feel himself. He said, if the child was stolen (which was probably the case), she would be rescued, for the police were deter- mined to search the city more closely than it had ever been searched before; that all the   WAIT AND SEE.      31 ponds and docks had been dragged, as the child had said she wanted" some pretty mud;" and it was almost sure that they were not in the water. "How long has that girl been with you, "exa " said he. "About six months, father. Why?" "Nothing, my child. Only I was going to ask if she was trusty. But, on second thoughts, she-must be, or you would not have trusted her." The husband and wife here looked at each other with a look of dismay and keen remorse. "Oh!" was all that either could utter. After the mother became a little more calm, the two gentlemen set out again to renew the search; but all in vain. That whole night passed, the next day passed, and still no tidings: indeed, no tidings came at all. Could the beautiful child have been found, the poor little servant Sally would have been soon for- gotten. Such is the world. Wearisome days and nights- oh, how long!- were the lot of this bereaved family;  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7378-00000019"/> 32      WAIT AND SEE. but they brought no hope. In vain it was that princely rewards were offered, and adver- tisements inserted in all the newspapers: no tidings came. At length, they " humbled themselves under the mighty hand of God," and their smitten hearts were brought to feel the justice of the blow which had prostrated their idols in the dust. They were both brought to say and feel from the inner temple of their tried hearts, which had passed through the furnace, "Father in heaven, thy will be done!"   33 CHAPTER   III. HGH POSITION. REVERSES OF FORTUNE. -PHLOSOPHY AND RELIGION. - REMOVAL. - THE MLL. - THE HUM- BLE, HAPPY HOME. TIME passed on, and they had become calm, if not reconciled. Mr. Dorset, who was liberally educated, but who preferred the mercantile to the learned professions, had applied Very closely to business, and had becomez quite wealthy. They now began to love gain, and to accumulate: indeed, they were about setting up a golden image, not in their house, but in the temple where all must worship if they worship in truth; forgetting that "-the love of money is the root of all evil," and also that command of the Saviour, "Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth." But " riches take to themselves wings, and fly away." The chastening hand was nigh; the loss of all their wealth was at hand.  O speculation!  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7378-00000020"/> 34      WAIT AND SEZ. how much of sorrow hast thou cost man- kind! how deep a poverty hast thou driven him into who has rashy run beyond his depth in thy precarious element! Capt. Winthrop, at the time of the death of his wife, - which occurred about two years before the marriage of their daughter, - was one of the wealthi- est citizens in Boston; but, being no longer swayed by judicious counsels, he ran heed- lessly and headlong into very risky schemes of speculation, which proved unsuccessful,- indeed, complete failures; which sunk all, and much more than all, of his capital. The consequence was, he found himself entirely and irretrievably ruined.  This sudden   calamity  completely  over- whelmed the once-powerful mind of Capt. Winthrop; and, when he found that his fail- ure would ruin some of his nearest and best ! friends, he fell beneath the stroke. It broke  his heart.  He lingered a few weeks, and died. Alexa was inconsolable under these accumu- lated sorrows, but knew not then their extent. j   WAIT AND SEE.      35 Her husband had indorsed Capt. Winthrop's paper to a heavy amount; beyond his strength even, as it appeared when his earthly all wag put " under the hammer," and proved insuffi- cient to cover the demands. But, ah! the heaviest stroke was still in store for her. When they knew the worst, he gazed long and earnestly into the sorrowful face of his wife, with such a look of despairing anguish, it nearly broke her heart. But she soon ral- lied, and with a sweet, affectionate look, said, "Dearest, we now see that our Father in heaven 'does all things well.' O my dear William, my own dear husband! do not grieve; let us not murmur: for our choicest blessings are still safe in God's holy keeping, and out of the world's reach. Your tender, deyoted heart, I trust, is still mine ; and let this trying, sorrowful hour prove the depth and strength of my-de- voted, unchanging love to you. My dear hus- band, what would the wealth of worlds be to me, without you? And doubtless your senti- ments would be the same in regard to me. What, then, do we lack? With God's blessing,  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7378-00000021"/> 36      WAIT AND SEE. what do we need? AWe have parted with all our idols that we once so fondly worshipped. We will henceforth lay up all our treasures where the blessed Saviour has promised they shall be safely kept for us: will we not, dear Willie?" "You are an angel, Alexa!" cried Dorset, tenderly embracing her; " my guardian angel!" And the strong man wept; but they were tears of joy more than of sorrow. "O God!" cried he, " my soul shall for ever thank thee for be- stowing on me this precious boon, this blessed treasure." The next half-hour was spent by this devoted pair in seeking aid and imploring wisdom from that holy Fountain which is for ever full, and ac- c essible to every creature, - to the lowest beg- gar as to the highest monarch. Having now no earthly means, no earthly hopes, they had learned to cast their anchor on the "Rock of Ages," and to trust in God, and in him alone. They now held'a consultation together re specting their present arrangements, but wait- ed for wisdom from above to direct their steps.   WAIT AND SEE.       37 In the mean time, they had many invitations from their relatives and former acquaintances to come to them; to make a home of their house, command their purse, &amp;c. But though they appreciated the kindness, and doubted not the sincerity, of these invitations, yet Mr. and Mrs. Dorset felt that their happiness hence- forth must be found in the " narrow path;" and that path was more easily travelled in solitude than in the "Vanity Fair " of fashion- able life. They removed a few miles from the city to a very small, poverty-stricken-looking cottage, in the town of Ryefield. The cottage was located in an obscure nook of that unfrequent- ed place, on a beautiful mill-stream. "I fear the situation will be a very unpleasant one to you, -dearest.  Let's see: there are but few buildings here. The mill we must count for one, you know; and then the miller's house, first over the stream yonder; and next beyond is the schoolhouse; and then, just up the hill, is the spire of the village, church. A little to the left, in that old brown house :withi stone 4   &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7378-00000022"/> 38      WAIT AND SEE. chimneys, resides the officiating clergyman,-- the Rev. Mr. Atherton. That very old house down yonder in the lots is the property of a very honest, industrious family, named Darley, I'm told. Alexa, it breaks my heart to think of bringing you, my precious wife, into such a place, even for a few weeks, until I can find something in the way of employment,-- some- thing that I can do, I care not what, if it is being journeyman to the miller. Haha!" "My own dear husband," replied Alexa, "I am perfectly contented: how could I be other- wise? Where you are, there is my happy home. This place is perfectly congenial to our present feelings, and suited to our present ability. Here let us humbly wait the helping hand of ' Our Father,' who ' tempers the wind to the shorn lamb." Mr. Dorset now walked out to the mill, and was engaged in conversation with the old miller. While he is absent, we will just peep inside of the house, while his wife stands leaning on a "pair of bars," looking towards the mill;   WAIT AND SEE.       39 where her husband, while conversing, stands abstractedly, throwing pebbles into the clear, flowing stream. The interior of the house was divided into four rooms; viz., kitchen, parlor, bedroom, and pantry, or buttery as it was then called. They had taken the house, already furnished, of a fa- mily who were going " out West." The furni- ture of their city residence, which was generous- ly given back to them (true, it was generously given up to the creditors; for the law could not have claimed the whole), was sold for enough to secure them this little, humble home, with its furniture and fixings. The parlor was a plastered, low-studded room, of good size: the floor, which had never seen a carpet, was of very white and clean boards. There was a bed at the far corner of the room, made up very high, and covered with a blue and white wool- len-yarn coverlet, with nice-looking pillows. In one corner of the room stood a high-backed "great-chair,"-"' the old -arm-chair;" while four or five humbler chairs did duty in different parts of the room. In another corner was a  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7378-00000023"/> 40      WAIT AND SEE. china-closet, or buffet as it was then called, with a glass door. Through this door could be seen two decanters, three wine-glasses, two tumblers, and a salver, together with a tea-set of queen's ware for six. Between two windows, trimmed with oak-leaf trimmings, was a small Dutch looking-glass, ornamented with aspara- gus-boughs, with a red pincushion hanging pendent beneath; and a table directly under that, covered with oil-cloth. The kitchen was more simple. A table of plain wood, three wooden chairs, and a chest of drawers, com- pleted the inventory; unless we name a huge pair of andirons, with shovel and tongs to match. The bedroom contained a decent bed, one chair, a light stand, and a pair of old boots. The buttery held the cooking utensils, mostly of wood, iron, and pewter, with a slender stock of groceries and provisions. The garret- which was lighted with one window, four panes square - was a complete chaos of old wheels, dried herbs, dried peppers, old irons, old shoes, and spiders' webs. Mrs. Dorset, in her brighter days, was never   WAIT AND SEE,      41 afraid of soiling her hands when occasion required. Although she controlled many ser- vants, there were times when she saw them very weary. She would then take hold, and help them out, in any part of the house. In the kitchen, she would often lend the cook a helping hand if needed, until she had some practice as well as theory; as every house- keeper should have, no matter how wealthy. When her husband returned from talking with the miller, as our readers will recollect we left him, he found his wife mixing a cake in a wooden trencher. He laughed heartily at first; but, the next moment, every muscle of his face swelled with agony. "O my dar- ling wife!" cried he, " must I see you brought to this ." "Why, William, I do it with pleasure. It will be time enough to murmur when you see me have nothing to mix; and, even then, we should have no right to do so. Think of that, love; and keep up your spirits. To see you despondent is to me much harder than any toil or privation." 4*  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7378-00000024"/> 42      WAIT AND SEE. "O Alexa! who can despond with such a precious, lovely being at his side? I thought I loved you full well in the days of our pro- sperity; but, oh, what an angel of purity and light you have proved in this dark night of sorrow! Most excellent among earth's fairest daughters, I am blest,--blest with thee. I ask no more on earth." "Remember and bless the Giver, dear Wil- liam, and not prize earthly mould too highly," said Mrs. Dorset. Changing the subject, she asked, "How were you pleased with our neigh- bor, the miller? You seemed to be conversing with him as I was looking that way." "I was; and what will you say, dearest, when I tell you that I have engaged to tend mill for the old man?" "Why, William! But you are jesting." "No, I am not. He said he was getting old, and was able to hire, if he could find a suitable person to take his place. I reflected for a moment, saying mentally, "Any thing ra- ther than want, or to depend on the precarious bounty of wealthy relatives; or, what would   WAIT AND SEE.      43 be harder still, to have my dear wife obliged to part with the few valuables that ornamented her lovely person on the happiest day of my life, or the happiest I had ever then seen, a wedding-gift from her dear departed father. So, for a very small salary, I engaged until I could obtain more profitable business: then I am to be at liberty;" His wife felt many fears that the work would be too laborious, and- injure his health; or that he would not understand the business well enough to succeed. Finally, she urged him not to undertake it. She ran to the trunk, and brought forth the wedding-present, say- ing, "I can keep them no longer. There, my husband, take them: you are more than wel- come. But let me keep the most valued jewel out of that damp, dangerous place." "But, my dear, as I have engaged, had I not better go down and try it for a day or so . " The sorrowful wife gave a reluctant consent. She felt a sad foreboding, which she could not then define; but forbore to urge him farther.  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7378-00000025"/> " CHAPTER IV. DEATH OF MR. DORSET.-A HEART-RENDING SCENE. THE next morning, Mr. Dorset commenced his labors. The miller staid with him until noon to initiate him into his duties. Mr. Dorset had observed all the miller did, and thought he could get on alone in the afternoon if the miller would come and put the wheel in mo- tion. All went on well. Mr. Dorset was pleased with the novelty of his employment, and felt much encouraged. The next morning, he went down to try alone. He had observed, the day before, that the miller, before hoisting the water-gate, had put one foot on the wheel, and examined it, and looked into the flume to see that all was right. Thinking that was a part of the process, he did the same: but, while his foot was on the wheel, some mischievous boys had come to get corn ground; and, sup- posing that the miller had not yet come to the   WAIT AND SEE.      45 mill, said one of them, "By jingo! let's put in our corn, and grind it ourselves, toll-free. Hurrah! here goes!"And, suiting the action to the word, he hoisted the water-gate. The consequence was, that Mr. Dorset was preci- pitated into the flume, and was revolved by the water-wheel until he was literally crushed to atoms! When he first fell on the wheel, he cried out for help. The boys, hearing his voice, were frightened, and fled, leaving the mill going. A few moments after, a man, crossing the bridge over the stream, observed that the water looked red.  He instantly dismounted, and searched up and down; but, finding nothing, he next entered the mill. His first act was to shut the water-gate. He then commenced a strict search in every part of the building, but could discover nothing. He then looked into the flume; and who can describe his horror at the dreadful sight? There was scarce any appearance of humanity in the mangled mass before him. He ran as fast as his fainting strength would  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7378-00000026"/> "      WAIT AND SEE. permit, and gave the alarm. A number of men, who happened to be within hearing, rushed to the scene of disaster; among the rest, the father of the two boys who had done this dreadful deed. Knowing his sons had been sent to the mill that morning, he had no doubt that it was their mangled remains he then saw; and from that hour he was a raving i maniac. But, on attempting to take up the remains, there appeared to be but one person; and that, by shreds of the garments, was identified as Mr. Dorset. Oh, what tidings for his poor wife! The question was, who could bear to carry the shocking news, which it was feared would destroy her senses, if not her life? Mr. Darley (Uncle Ben), being present, was pre- vailed on to go. In the most cautious and prudent manner possible, he tried to begin. Poor Mrs. Dorset, whose foreboding heart felt the shadow of a dreadful announcement, said, "Stay, Mr. Darley: not yet. I must look to God for strength first." She retired for a short time, and then returned with a face pale   WAIT AND SEE.      47 as marble, but calm and composed, saying, "I am ready now, Mr. Darley. I have laid my last earthly treasure, my heart's idol, on God's altar, and feel that the sacrifice is accepted. Father, thy will be done. Do not hesitate: I can bear it now, be it what it may." Mr. Darley then, in the most circumspect manner, related gradually what had befallen her husband. She neither screamed nor faint- ed, but sat motionless, and pale as death. At length she cried, "O my God, more strength! Give me thy sustaining strength, my God!" After a few moments of deep mental agony, in a calm, sweet tone she cried, "Not as I will, but as Thou wiliest." The remains were enclosed from view, and carried to her dwelling. Kind neighbors con- ducted the funeral (he had no near relatives at hand), and deposited the broken fragments of the deceased in his cold narrow bed, to rest in that " dreamless sleep that knows no waking" until the bright morning of the resurrection.  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7378-00000027"/> 48 CHAPTER V. THE DESOIATE WIDOW. - SUBMSSION TO THE DIVINE WILL. THE desolate widow was kindly invited by many of her neighbors to go directly home with them; but, expressing her gratitude for that and all their kind attentions, she said she preferred to remain where she last saw him, her heart's idol. She remained solitary for some months, excepting the friendly calls of her plain but sympathizing neighbors. How valued, how highly valued, was the lifelike portrait of her dear departed William! She would sit whole hours before it. It was her solace. She would often address it, saying, O dearest, dearest! how bright, sweet, and happy you look! Ah! it is the spirit of my departed one that smiles on me so sweetly in that mystic semblance. A thousand blessings on the genius who produced it!"   WAIT AND SEE.      49 That almost worshipped picture was the only testimonial of their taste and benevolence she now possessed; for they did not intend to have the portraits until their little Effie was four years of age (how deeply they afterwards regretted the neglect, when she could be seen no more!). But an artist, who was poor and unemployed, excited their sympathy. He was very sensitive, and Mr. Dorset feared to wound his feelings by offering pecuniary aid. "I have it," said Mrs. Dorset. "Let him paint your portrait; and, whether pleased or not, give him double price: he will gratefully accept it in any form but charity." How little she then thought, when her benevolent heart was work- ing out a scheme to relieve without wounding, that it would eventually be such a blessing to herself! As already stated, after a few months'- seclu- sion, she began to reflect, and try to think of some method to obtain an independent support, without leaving a place so dear and so sacred to her, which afforded that solitude so congenial to her present feelings. She had disposed of 5  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7378-00000028"/> 50      WAIT AND SEE. nearly all her former rich apparel and orna- ments through the agency of some kind ladies who resided in a neighboring village. The proceeds of these amounted to much more than she had anticipated. The Rev. Mr. Atherton had rather a conscious look when she asked him how it was possible that Mrs. Atherton and the other ladies had realized so much money on the sale; for she felt a suspicion she dared not name. Yet it was exactly true, that those ladies had unitedly smuggled in fifty dollars of their own money, and sent the reve- rend gentleman with it to avoid answering any questions or receiving any thanks. At length, she adopted the plan of opening a school for the children of that vicinity. The proposal met with a joyful reception by the whole community. The old schoolhouse was repaired and thoroughly scrubbed in every part, the windows cleaned, the yard swept neatly, and a nice chair carried in, and placed at the desk. A quire of nice paper; a few neatly bound, interesting books; a loaf of rich plum-cake; some large greenings; a paper of   WAIT AND SEE.       51 capital box-raisins; and a good, plain silver watch, - were deposited in the desk, together with a note in the name of " the ladies," soli- citing her acceptance; and the school com- menced on that bright Monday morning, on the 1st of May, when we were first introduced to its gentle, sorrow-blighted instructress.  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7378-00000029"/> 52 CHAPTER    VI. SAYINGS AND DOINGS OF UNCLE BEN AND AUNT NABBY.- THE NEAT, SHREWD HOUSEWIFE. THE Darleys, by their industry and frugality, had saved a small sum of money, which they hoarded with a miser's care. Uncle Ben, be- sides the products of his land,--which he could readily turn into cash by carrying it to the city in panniers, slung over the back of "Dobbin," -had other revenues.  He some- times worked as day-laborer on the farms of his more wealthy neighbors; and then he had a nook where he officiated as blacksmith, whenever that kind of service was required. Again: he had a shoe-bench, where he made and mended their own shoes and those of their neighbors, which kept him fully employ- ed on stormy days and long winter evenings. But Aunt Nabby, though she loved money, abhorred litter; and, as a preventive, made Uncle Ben place his bench close in a corner   WAIT AND SEE.      53 of the capacious fireplace, near the end of the back-log, and marked the bounds with chalk, over which bounds no truant shred of leather ever had the presumption to pass. Aunt Nabby was constantly delving. Her housewifery, spinning, weaving, knitting, sew- ing, &amp;c., together with the care of her pigs, poultry, and the milk of her two cows (from which she made a great many pounds of ex- cellent butter every year; and her butter always brought the highest price in the mar- ket), kept her from ever having a moment's leisure. The method by which .she obtained such a large amount of butter was simply this, - that no milk was allowed to be used in the family so long as one particle of cream could possibly be coaxed from it. After that process, it was used for the family meals; and, if en- tirely soured, for the pigs. NWhen the milk was more transparent than usual, Aunt Nabby would say, "Ef anybody. is so dainty they can't eat sich as is set afore 'em, they can go without. For my part, I'm glad to git it; and gaess they'll be, 'fore they die." 6*  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7378-00000030"/> 54      WAIT AND SEE. We know there is a great difference between genuine prudence and parsimony. Some other- wise worthy persons descend gradually into a spirit of avarice, until their highest aim, before they are aware of it, is " laying up treasures on earth;" forgetting that the " love of money is the root of all evil." Our thrifty couple just referred to were fast falling into such a snare through the love of gain. They invariably refused their mite in the way of charity, even when a morsel of bread was all the hungry beggar sought. They both felt it a duty to spurn the needy supplicant from their door. "Let 'em go and work," they would say, " same as we hev tu.'-"I'm not going to slave myself," Aunt Nabby would say, " to support the lazy vagabonds. The marcy knows that I hev my hands full to keep my own in vittels. Let sich critters go where they belong, - to the workhouse: 'tis the most fittest place for.'em." Ah! Aunt Nabby, all such feelings must be unravelled in a future day.   55 CHAPTER   VII. THE SCHOOL.-LITTLE MARY'S PROPHECY. MRS. DORSET had got her little school com- pletely arranged and regulated, and the march of improvement began. It was beginning to have a salutary effect on her health and spirits. Her being surrounded by so many artless, affectionate beings, - whom she hoped to have a hand in training for heaven,'- had already beguiled many a sorrowful hour. She received many tokens of sympathy and regard from her employers, who manifested the most perfect confidence in her as a teacher, as a lady, and as a Christian. Mr. Darley's children were excellent scho- 'lars, and as punctual as " clock-work." Mary always tugged in a great roll of coarse gray- wool knitting-work, with  a courtesy, and "Mamma thes I must knit more, if you pleathe, Mrs. Dorthet. She thes I must finith  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7378-00000031"/> 56      WAIT AND SEE. this tocking to-day. She thes she wanths me to mind my work, and not stop to 'tend to the exerthises, that won't never du nobody no good." This first little trial scarce found a place in Mrs. Dorset's mind, it was so filled with greater ones. She calmly replied, "Very well, dear. Tell your mamma that it shall be according to her wish." Little Mary loved her teacher dearly, and was very fond of attending school; but every day confirmed Mrs. Dorset's fears that her health was gradually sinking. She manifested such feebleness and languor, that Mrs. Dorset performed her knitting-tasks with her own hands, and gave her no lessons. But still she did not recruit, but became more and more emaciated; and her buoyant spirits had fled. Notwithstanding the utmost kindness and at- tention, Mrs. Dorset now felt it incumbent on her to see Mary's parents, and state her appre- hensions to them.  But a voice within said, "What thou doest, do quickly:" so that, not being able to go that day in person, she wrote   WAIT AND SEE.      57 a note, which she sent by Alfred,- their oldest son; tever once thinking it possible that there was any family in the neighborhood who could not read writing. The note was not ittelligi- ble; but Uncle Ben sent word that he would call, the first time he went to mill, and see her. A day or two subsequent, Mary, on return- ing home, fainted- as she entered her father's door. He, being near, with outspread arms caught her in time to save her from falling on the threshold. He carried her to bed, where she lay motionless and breathless for some time; while the terrified parents were trying every restorative in their power, sobbing and sighing, and calling her by every endearing name, until she gasped, and slowly opening her eyes, and reaching up her arms, she clasped them both in one fond embrace, saying,: "I am going to leave you, but not just yet. I am going to be a little angel before long; ain t I, mamma?" "Oh! don't talk so, child," said her mother: "I cannot bear it." And both parents sobbed  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7378-00000032"/> 58      WAIT AND SEE. and wept, with a sad foreboding that what the child said was prophetic. In the mean time, Mary had fallen into a gentle sleep. "O husband!' cried the sor- rowful mother, "I have been the means of her sickness, and who knows but the cause of her death?" "Why, wife? - why so?." "Oh! I have made her work too hard at home, and set her a task every day on the knitting at school. Oh, if I could only take it back! And, when she said she could not eat the milk, I made her do it. Lord a' massy! what could I be a thinkin' on? Oh, dear! -oh, dear!" "Why, Nabby!" was the only reply. The father then approached the bed where Mary lay. She was awake, and quite feverish. "Wife," said he, "'tis my 'pinion, we better hev the doctor to her; hadn't we?" "Oh! do what you think best.  I don't care to save the money now. Send Alf. I can't hev you go: I can't be left alone with the poor sick child. Mary, can't you eat some   WAIT AND SEE.      59 crackers if daddy gets 'em for ye?

THE PREMSES: ITS APPOINTMENTS. -POMPOUS DISPLAY OF THE LANDLORD AND WIFE, &amp;C. THERE was quite a sensation at Ryefield Village - or rather Ryefield Corner, as it was called - on the appearance of a splendid equipage, which was reined in at the Crown and Anchor (the only public-house in that part of the town); from which a lady and gentleman of middle age, a young lady of seventeen, and a boy of twelve, alighted, and, followed by two servants of their own house- hold, entered the house, and were lost to the view of the curious of both sexes, who had been gazing in astonishment from the time of their arrival. Parlor, lodgings, and supper being previously engaged by the new-comers, they were at once shown to their rooms. The best rooms had been put in the best order, and the larder replenished with the best the   WAIT AND SEE.      61 city markets afforded. All was bustle and commotion throughout the house. The host, like his profession generally, was fat, shrewd, smiling, and facetious. Mrs. Bolton, the hostess, on the arrival of their distinguished guests, after giving a few hurried, general orders in the kitchen, fled to her own room to give a few finishing touches to her toilet by rubbing prepared chalk on her face, and putting on her best new cap, manufactured of "I woven air," and bought expressly for the present occasion. She then donned her best house-dress, and went to superintend the exer- cises. The genteel family--from the city of Bostont was rumored in the kitchen--would remain for some days, and perhaps weeks. Oh! it was a great day for the Boltons. "Du tell," said Mrs. Jones (as she popped in the back-way) to Mrs. Bolton, who was giving final orders in the kitchen respecting the supper, "what on airth has come?." "Why, Mrs. Jones, is it such a wonderful thing for us to have genteel company from the city?" said Mrs. Bolton proudly. 6  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7378-00000034"/> 62      WAIT AND SEE. "Oh, law sakes! I didn't know but you would let me know who they be." "We're too busy now: some other time, Mrs. Jones. Susan! don't you see? Do mind what 'you are about: you are spilling the gravy!" The newly arrived grandees were to sup in their own room, as their servant informed the mistress, and be served by their own domestics: so that our worthy hostess not only lost her extra toilet, but the opportunity of addressing to them the set speeches she had prepared for the occasion; to say nothing of the disappoint- ment of not being able to see what the ladies had dressed in, and thereby to find out the latest fashions. This last seemed almost too much for her philosophy or endurance. Peter Bolton, Esq., " mine host" of the inn, was in perfect ecstasies. To think of the profits! - to say nothing of the eclat of having such patrons. Though not fond of dress him- self, he had, at the suggestion of his wife, shaved, and brushed his hair in the most approved style; viz., parted it on the left side.   WAIT AND SEE.      63 Moreover, he had been very successful in the cultivation of his whiskers; and this, together with his clean dicky, best stock and vest, and his nice plaid coat and pants, rendered him complete: so that he could view himself in the mirror not only with confidence, but with pleasure. His face now said, as plainly as face could say, "Where's my equal in person, dress, or manners?  The hired help all felt that they must look and act their best.  The housemaids dis- played, on that occasion, their new finery, in the shape of ear-rings, an extra number of finger-rings, various colored bows of rib- bon, &amp;c., with hair oiled and brushed in the first degree. Indeed, the whole establish- ment seemed bent-on appearing to advantage. Even the hostler washed his face and hands on that day of general amplification, imagining himself the " figure-head" of the Crown and Anchor.  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7378-00000035"/> " CHAPTER IX. THE MORNING RIDE. --THE LANDLORD'S IDEAS OF GOOD SOCIETY. THE next morning, our city guests   Philip Huntley, Esq., his wife, daughter, and young son-  went out for an early drive.   They were perfectly delighted with the freshness of the morning. The bright flowers, glittering with dewdrops, and perfuming the air with their sweet, soft fragrance; the birds, twit- tering and carolling their morning hymn to Him- "Who shaped their finer mould, Who tipped their glittering wings with gold, And tuned their voice to praise,"-  all, all was perfectly beautiful and glorious, and by our guests of the inn was highly enjoyed and appreciated. "Father," said young Frederic, " will you please to let me become a farmer, and live   WAIT AND SEE.      65 out in this beautiful, splendid place? I would rather not go to the university, if you please, father." "Why, my son? But never mind now: we can settle that question at some future time, and not encumber ourselves with it at present," replied Mr. Huntley. They had now reached the inn. The mother and daughter looked as fair, as smiling, and almost as bright, as the dew-gemmed flowers whose fragrance they had just inhaled, and which had perfumed their spirits even to the soul's centre, and rendered them, for the time, completely happy. Mr. Bolton was stationed near the door they would enter, determined to obtain a bow and a " good-morning;" while Mrs. Bolton, en dishabille, was peering through the blinds in an upper room. The ladies passed up to their room. Mr. Huntley, perceiving that the landlord was anxious to enter into conversa- tion, paused, and inquired if there was good society in that part of Ryefield. The question took Mr. Bolton rather by surprise. If he 6*  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7378-00000036"/> "      WAIT AND SEE.  said, Very little," he feared that the Huntleys  would leave them too soon. Nor did he, like to compromise himself by answering in the  affirmative, lest they might not give him credit for good taste. "Have the goodness to name  a few of your neighbors such as you can  recommend," said Mr. Huntley.  Bolton at length replied, "There is the Rev. Mr. Atherton (our minister) and his wife,  who would be good society if they didn't live  2: in that 'tarnal old house. Then the school- teacher (Mrs. Dorset), they say, is a rale,  ginuine lady: but, blast it! she lives like a hermit, with only one domestic, in that little brown hut just over the bridge yonder; and she couldn't entertain company in that mise-  rable place, you know.  But there is some rich people over on t'other side of the village, an' they are rale genteel, -  the Smiths, Cobbs, Spinks, and Bartols, that live in them four great grand  houses  yonder, right beyend them  great elm-trees. They would all be fust-rate society, I calculate." Mr. Huntley had been an attentive listener   WAIT AND SEE.       67 to these remarks. At their close, said he, "The Rev. Mr. Atherton? I would like to see him." And, taking a card-case from his pocket, he drew forth a card, wrote something on the back with a pencil, and then placed it in a nice envelope. 'Freddy, my son, can you find the way"-- "Oh! by no means. I will send it, sir; I will send it," said Mr. Bolton. "Here, Joe: take Mr. Hntley's card to Mr. Atherton; and be careful and not lose it. Are your hands perfectly clean? If not, go right off and wash 'em, and be ready in no time. Come, hurry!"  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7378-00000037"/> 68 CHAPTER X. THE HUNTLEYS.- THE REV. MR. ATHERTON AND FAMLY. MRS. HUNTLEY was a fair, agreeable-looking woman, but rather plain, when contrasted with the rich, glowing countenance of her husband.  But her lovely, Heaven-taught manners would soon make the most beautiful of her sex grow discontented with themselves, and strive to resemble her. Arielle, her only daughter, was merely pretty, or moderately handsome at best. She had inherited her father's brilliancy of complexion; but her features were rather large and irregular: yet the expression of her face was very lovely and interesting. Frederic, their only son and petted idol, was extremely handsome; having blended in his countenance his father's manly beauty with the sweetness and soul-lit expression of his mother.   WAIT AND SEE.       69 "That is rather a singular-looking convey- ance," said Freddy, " and seems to be coming this way. Do look, sister mine! I never saw a black sheep have white wool before; did you, sis? "If you refer to the driver of that clum- sy-looking vehicle just entering the court- yard "- "Exactly." "Well, ma bonnie bub, that which you call 'white wool' is merely gray hair; which, we read in Scripture, is a ' cxown of glory, if found in the way of righteousness.' It is very possible, that old African wears a crown superior in that respect to most of the crowned heads in Christendom." "Excellent! Why, sis Ari, you'd better change with the Rev. Mr. What-ye-call-'im, next sabbath.  Your eloquence would be irresistible. 'No stubborn sinner able to withstand The force and reasoning of your lily hand,' - especially among a certain part of the audi- ence. Ha, ha, ha!"  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7378-00000038"/> 70      WAIT AND SEE. Just then, a servant announced the Rev. Mr. Atherton and family.  Mr. Huntley   { warmly grasped the outstretched hand of Mr. Atherton. "Extremely happy, sir, to make your ac- quaintance, or rather to renew it. Thought I could not be mistaken. And you, sir,'- do you recollect Phil?" "I do, I do! Is it possible? Bless you, my dear sir!" exclaimed Mr. Atherton, still pressing the hand he held in a firmer grasp. "Pray, excuse my stupidity in not recognizing you at first. It can be attributable to nothing but your personal improvement. I congratu- late you, sir." The ceremony of introduction being over, we leave them all seated, and engaged in interesting conversation, while we tell you more about the Athertons. Theodore, their only son, was a talented, fine-looking young man, about eighteen years of age. Fanny, their youngest darling, was just entering her " teens; " a bright, beautiful child, but of a wayward temperament,-not   WAIT AND SEE.      71 amiable. Her mother said that her disposi- tion-being very sensitive--was not generally understood, but that she was very affectionate and docile to those who did understand her.  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7378-00000039"/> " CHAPTER XI. A COLLOQUY BETWEEN THE HOSTLER OF THE INN AND OLD JUBA, A FREED SLAVE. - A VERY AGREEABLE AC- QUAINTANCE FORMED. "HALLOO, darkee!" said the hostler of the inn to Juba.!"WThy the Old Boy don't you, while your master is busy with the Boston gentry, just slip off with that splendid equipage? That ole boss looks as ef he orter had his freedom 'fore now. And that carryall-faith, it must hev belonged to the family of Methu- selah, I calkerlate.  Why don't you slope, Snowhall?" "Look a heah, Mas'r Hoslem: I guess you got a heart bracker den dis nigger's face, ef you put sich debeltry into he hed." "Vell, now, Jube, I's oney in fun; that's all. But say, can't I trade with you? I want jest sich a conweyance." "You tink I sell? Wy, dis ekypage 'long to missis 'sclusively She daddy - ole Massa   WAIT AND SEE.       73 Newell - gin it to her. Gorrey! tink I sell . Oh, you git out! Guess mas'r handle you widout mittens nex' fus day, you don't .mine you hits! He, he, he!" "But he'd orter be handled with lucifer mittens, to load that poor old boss so con- foundedly. Why, blast it! here's no less than five of you; and that old rattle-trap is heavy enough for one hoss to draw down hill empty, I swear! Why didn't the young reverence drive, ef the old one was too lazy, and leave you at home?" "Jes what he wanted to: but mas'r said, ' Let the poor fellow go, he will enjoy: it so much' (dare massa right); and missis say, ' Let Juba go, by all means.'

Ef you am, give dis cullud gemman a chaw of 'backer. He, he, he!" Juba was an African by birth, and a slave, owned by the father of his present master. He 7  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7378-00000040"/> 74      WAIT AND SEE. had his liberty long years ago; but the fellow would not budge: so he was still retained in the family at the parsonage. For Mr. Ather- ton said, that, while he had a home and a shelter, his faithful Juba should share it: he could not turn him off in his old age. We have already seen that the old slave's feelings were considered and consulted before those of an only son. Mr. Atherton and family now rose to depart. They had spent an hour very agreeably. The  I families were mutually delighted; and after many cordial expressions of courtesy and heart- felt kindness on both sides, and promises of cultivating the friendship thus commenced, the parting adieus were made, the Athertons returned home, and the Huntleys decided to prolong their stay at the Crown and Anchor.   CHAPTER   XII. A SABBATH IN RYEFIELD. - GOING TO CHURCH.- THE PREACHER. - DISPLAY AND GLITTER OF THE LADIES' DRESSES. THE sabbath after the meeting of our two families rose clear, beautiful, and bright. The church-bells, with their melodious tones, were summoning worshippers to the house of prayer. The Huntleys had invited Mr. Bolton and wife to take a seat in their carriage, and ride with them to church. The Boltons were in perfect ecstasies of delight; and, though difficult for both to be absent from the inn at the same time, they wisely concluded that such invitations were not often to be had, and therefore not to be declined. Both went, rigged out in their best. Mrs. Bolton was so gorgeously arrayed, that she looked as we should imagine a comet on fire would look, with a' rainbow festooned in tasteful style many times around it. The splen- dor of the landlady quite eclipsed the plainly  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7378-00000041"/> 76      WAIT AND SEE. dressed, plain Mrs. Huntley. The latter, with her simple bonnet, and light, steel-colored silk-dress, appeared as a mere speck, an atom, beside the colossal majesty of Mrs. Bolton, be- decked with a profusion of jewelry, an orange- colored satin-dress, with pink shawl, and light-yellow bonnet, trimmed with blue and straw-colored flowers, and numerous bows of apple-green ribbon. When they drove up to the chapel, Mrs. Atherton and children were waiting their arri- val at the entrance. Her husband had entered the sacred desk some time before, and left it with her to do the pew honors to the new- comers. "You will take seats with us, I hope," said she. But Mr. Bolton vetoed that at once by assuring them that there were plenty of seats in his pew for them all. Mrs. Atherton then said she must compromise by only claiming the juniors, though she would much prefer having the whole family; but would not be so selfish as to interfere with any arrangements of theirs.   WAIT AND SEE.      " So Arielle and Frederic went with her. Next came the glad, tuiumphant face of the landlord, followed by that lovely pair, the Hunt- leys. The resplendent Mrs. Bolton brought up the rear. (And wasn't there gazing?. Gracious! if you could only have seen their eyes at the full!) Directly Mr. Atherton arose, with his benign countenance beaming a foretaste of heaven. Every eye in the assembly was turned at once on him. How beautiful he appeared on that blessed sabbath morning! His clerical robe, though ample, could not conceal the graceful form within. His face was a perfect type of manly beauty, beaming with eloquence and Christian love. The services now commenced.  In them, this faithful, humble disciple held up, not him- self, but his divine Master. On this occasion, the Smiths, Cobbs, Spinks, and Bartols were all present, and most exqui- sitely arrayed, in hopes of seeing the "Boston grandees," as they styled the Huntleys. They came within one of throwing our splendid 7*  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7378-00000042"/> 78       WAIT AND SEE. landlady into the shade by their superabun- dant brilliancy. Mrs. Atherton, though rather above middle stature, was scarcely visible to eyes which had been dazzled by such gorgeous splendor. Yet there she sat in perfect simplicity, with all her personal and moral beauty, -a lovely, grace- ful woman; a pattern wife; and a humble, devoted Christian.   Rapt in the sacred duties of the day, she saw no one, heard no one, but the messenger of truth,-  her first, last, best- beloved beneath heaven. "By him, the violated law spoke out Its thunders ; and by him, in strains as sweet As angels use, the gospel whispered peace."   79 CHAPTER    XIII. THE HOUSE OF MOURNING. - DEATH OF LITTLE MARY. WE now return to the house of mourning. It s midnight, and the wail of grief is heard From the open casement of Benjamin Darley. Reader, do you not recollect poor little Mary, whom we left sick? Here lay the beautiful ittle casket: but the gem had flown; the Ethereal essence of her young being had passed ;o that mysterious, immortal, glorious region )f the blest, where God's angels congregate to sound the anthems of redeeming love. (Her prophecy was fulfilled.) The parents were inconsolable: it was their first heavy sorrow. Mrs. Dorset, like a ministering angel, was en- leavoring to comfort and console them by every neans in her power. - She besought them to rive their darling back to her Maker without )me murmuring word, and to try to give their  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7378-00000043"/> 80      WAIT AND SEE. hearts to him at the same time; to strive to give up every cherished idol, be it what it may; to worship God, and him only; assuring them that true happiness could be found in no other way. They were humbled, and their worldly spirits broken, under the weight of this crush- ing blow. Mrs. Dorset had been unremitting in her ministrations by the sick-bed of her lovely little pupil; and now, in the hour of their heart-rending sorrow and bereavement, they leaned on her as their only stay. Poor souls! they had'not yet learned to lean on the arm of Jehovah. But the deep fount in their hearts had been stirred. The world had lost its attractions. They now felt like the dove, that could find no rest for the sole of her foot until she returned to the ark. There was a visible change in the views and feelings of this afflicted family. Their energies were crushed, their covetous feelings subdued. Their eyes were opened to view the things of this world in their true light. Their hopes were now turned to the true Source of life and light. The Lord heard them in the day of trouble,   -WAIT AND SEE.      81 and helped them. They now took the yoke of Christ, and found rest to their souls. Mrs. Dorset's finger of faith had pointed the way. They followed, and were made happy by "faith in the Son of God."  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7378-00000044"/> 82 CHAPTER XIV. MRS. DORSET'S SCHOOL. - AUTUMN. -- A LARGE PARTY AT THE PARSONAGE. - EVERYBODY INVITED. - THE ARISTOCRACY OF RYEFIELD. - OLD JUBA'S GOOD MAN- AGEMENT AS HEAD WAITER. - CHARACTER OF THE' GUESTS. - THE SUPPER. - A FLIRTATION BETWEEN FRED AND FANNY. MRS. DORSET'S school had already gained high celebrity. Many of the   aristocracy of Rye- field wished to place their children under the care of so able and so accomplished a teacher; but to send  their daughters into that " old rack, that old, mean-looking schoolhouse," was out of the question. It was now   October, and the maple, that first unfolded its " summer robes," was begin- ning  to set the fall fashions by wearing very high  and variegated colors. The other trees were preparing   to follow as fast as circum- stances would permit. The garden, so much sought and admired in its morning  and noon,   WAIT AND SEE.      83 now in its " sear and yellow leaf," with only here and there a few decaying flowers to " tell where a garden had been,"-  therefore no longer attractive, - was discovered to be only a piece of ground, and was entirely neglected and unsought. The pleasant, flower-strewed walks, the splendid bouquets it had afforded, were passed over in silence, if not wholly for- gotten. Such is the constancy of the world. The Huntleys were now beginning to think of returning to their city residence, much against the inclinations of the younger mem- bers of the family. But the Athertons could not consent to their going yet, especially as they had not become acquainted with Mrs. Dorset. They could not intrude on her by introducing genteel strangers to her at her home; for she had not, as yet, given or ac- cepted invitations to visit. It was therefore decided in the domestic conclave at the parsonage to invite company before the departure -of their city friends. The next question was, "Whom   shal  we invite, and whom leave out?"  This was a  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7378-00000045"/> 84      WAIT AND SEE. rather puzzling affair to Mrs. Atherton. She wished to do right, and give no offence. "Husband, do you decide it," said she. " ell, dearest, I will try. Is there not something about such matters in our Saviour's admonitions to his followers? Fanny, give me the Testament." He opened it, and, after turning over the leaves for a few moments, read as follows: "' When ye make a feast, invite not the rich, who can invite you again; but invite the poor, who cannot invite you again: and ye shall receive your reward at the resurrection of the just.' There, dear wife: I can give you no better counsel than that." "But, Mr. Atherton, I do hope you will use a little reason. Is not this to be got up in honor of the dear Huntleys, who, you know, are very wealthy? Do, dear, be consistent; do." "I think the best way of settling it is to invite all our neighbors, rich and poor; for they are all reputable." "You are right, husband. It is, indeed,   WAIT AND SEE.       85 the only way of arranging it satisfactorily to all." "Mamma," said Theodore, "I think that arrangement will hardly be satisfactory to some of our aristocratic neighbors. But par- donl my interference." "Very excusable, my son. I wished to know your opinion on the subject, but hoped that it would co-incide with ours." "And so it does, mother, to a fraction. I rejoice in your decision, and think some others will undoubtedly." "Mother, you have not asked my opinion," said Fanny gayly. "But will there not be some tossing of heads when Uncle Ben and Aunt Nabby, old Peter Brown, and a few more of like kind, enter t" "It would show  plainly, my dear," said her father very seriously, " that the heads thus tossed were scantily furnished within; having hearts to match, with the exception of being much harder." The invitations were sent; the written ones by old Juba, who went into perfect ecstasies of 8  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7378-00000046"/> 86      WAIT AND SEE. delight, bowing and scraping at the delivery of every note, and showing his still white ' teeth from ear to ear. "Missis hope de ladies and gemmen not fail comin'. She be bery grad when de fuss  ! ober, she so conflisticated." The Athertons went in person to invite Mrs. Dorset, knowing it would be very diffi- cult to obtain her consent to be present at the party.- She pleaded with them to excuse  . her, and not deem her ungrateful; but really she could not think of it. They then repre-  j sented to her the advantage of becoming    V acquainted with the Huntleys, and of being  ] social with neighbors generally; and finally succeeded in obtaining a reluctant consent.   Uncle Ben and Aunt N abby also thought they  - could not go to meet proud strangers, in their trouble: besides, they had nothing suitable to X wear. That difficulty was soon removed by a   little assistance from Mrs. Dorset and Mrs. Atherton.  All things being arranged in that quarter,  I and all the invitations accepted, the day ar- i   WAIT AND SEE.        87 :ived, and the party began. A carriage had been sent at an early hour for Mrs. Dorset and the Darleys. The Huntleys and the Boltons arrived early. Introductions were completed; and the Huntleys, already delighted with Mrs. Dorset, were so cordial and sympathetic with Uncle Ben and Aunt Nabby and the other plain neighbors, that they felt quite at their ease, and seemed to enjoy themselves. The Boltons followed suit; and a social time en- sued before the Ryefield aristocracy arrived. At' length several carriages made their ap- pearance, winding round the hill among the great elms. Juba was stationed at the gate to meet the comers, and take charge of their horses. The first arrival was Mr. Jedediah Smith and lady, with their only daughter, Miss Celina Olivia Augusta Smith. The next were the Cobbs, with their two daughters, Miss Wilhelmina Matilda and Miss Seraphina Agnes Aurelia Cobb. Mr. and Mrs. Bartol, with their only son, Alexander Gustavus Adol- phus (a rat-looking child, about seven years old), came next. Mr. and Mrs. Spink, with  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7378-00000047"/> 88      WAIT AND SEE. their two daughters, Miss Ludensey Lucretia and Miss Marietta Victorielle Isabella Spink, brought up the rear. At the arrival of every carriage, old Juba would bow, till his head nearly touched the ground, with "How you do, massa and mis- sus? Me bery grad to see you.   How am de family?" They then were met at the  old-fashioned folding front-door by Mr. and    Mrs. Atherton, who received them with the     utmost cordiality and refined courtesy, and ushered them into the low, large old parlor; giving very thorough introductions, that there  might be no embarrassed or uncomfortable  feeling among any of their guests. All now were seated, and a brisk conversa- tion commenced; that is to say, about a dozen voices were heard at once.  We will try to inform our lady readers about the dresses on this occasion. Mrs. Atherton wore a black-   1 silk dress and simple cap.  Mrs. Dorset ap- peared in deepest weeds; Mrs. Huntley, in  ashes of rose-colored silk, very plain, with hair braided; Arielle and Fanny, in white, trans- :I{   89 WAIT AND SEE, parent muslin, each with a white rosebud in her hair (Arielle's hair formed a crown of braids, and Fanny's loose ringlets of dark brown hung down to her waist). Some of the other ladies were dressed- plain, butall very neat. Aunt Nabby wore a black alpaca-silk apron and mourning cap. Mrs. Bolton, and the house of Smith, Cobb, Spink, and Bartol, were an assemblage of brilliant jewelry and gorgeous colors, too dazzling to be minutely described; each feeling determined to outshine the rest, and to let city folks see that Ryefield was not quite so dowdy as they might have imagined. Mr. Atherton had adroitly managed to get some of the poorer, plainer class grouped to- gether; sitting himself, like his divine Master, "in their midst;" conversing freely and fami- liarly with them relative to their domestic affairs, and then on the weightier concerns of a future life. The juniors were enjoying the freshness of life's morning in chatting, singing, promenad- ing, and weaving bouquets of the remaining 8*  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7378-00000048"/> 90      WAIT AND SEE. flowers. Theodore Atherton was too well bred to pay exclusive attention to Arielle Huntley; but we have no positive proof that he did not  grudge the compulsory attentions bestowed elsewhere. Fanny was all rapture and delight on this occasion; for the beautiful young Fre- deric was constantly by her side. What their thoughts then were, it is impossible for us to deternline. Mr. Alexander Gustavus Adol- phus Bartol, dressed in the extreme of fashion, found his enjoyment in kicking the dog, pinch- ing the cat, and cramming his mouth with nuts, fruit, and candy. The supper now being ready, all repaired to the great old dining-room. Uncle Ben and Aunt NAabby were placed next to Mr. Atherton, that they might not feel embarrassed. Mrs. Dorset sat at the right hand of Mrs. Atherton, and the rest promiscuously. After a blessing craved by the parson, the carving commenced. "Carving!" say you in astonishment? Why, yes, dear, innocent reader. Allow me to in- form you, that, in those days, people had use for their carving-knives.   " WAIT AIND SEE. The two Huntley servants, and a waiter from the Crown and Anchorj were delighted to assist on this occasion.  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7378-00000049"/> 92 CHAPTER   XV. THE MSERABLE BEGGAR.-THE PASTOR'S BENEVOLENCE; &amp;C. THE serving and supper had commenced, and every one seemed to enjoy it, except the misses of the aristocracy. They were tossing their heads, bridling and exchanging significant glances, and telegraphing ironically that they were highly honored.   Mrs. Smith, taking opportunity when the general attention was  directed another way, whispered to Mrs. Bartol that she should have staid at home, had sheI known that the hedges were to be searched, and ditches to be dragged, to complete the party.  Just then, old Juba rushed into the room  with a face full of meaning and his broadest grin.  Advancing towards his master with a low bow, he asked permission to approach. This being granted, he whispered his errand. The last sentence only was heard: ," It suthin' 'sides beggar, massa."   WAIT AND SEE.      93 Mr. Atherton calmly asked the company to xcuse him for a moment, and left the room. n the kitchen, he found the most miserable- )oking beggar he had ever beheld. He had ne arm in a sling, a patch over one eye, an wful-looking humped back, long beard, mat- ed hair, and an old slouched hat, and was lothedain tattered rags. Mr. Atherton blandly iquired if he would like something to eat. "Yes! oh, yes!" gasped he; " in Heaven's Lame!" "Set him something immediately," said Mr. Ltherton; " and let it be the same --that is, he best there is, Juba; and see that he is treated nith kindness." He then said to the stranger, You shall be well cared for. I must go now. Wait here until I return to you." Mr. Atherton apologized to the company as ie returned to the table, and observed that it vas a poor man, who appeared very needy. The supper went on most agreeably. Every hing was very nice, and beautifully served up. rhe Huntleys were very familiar and social vith the plainer, poorer class; but merely civil  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7378-00000050"/> "     WAIT AND SEE.  and polite to the wealthy proud. Some were talking on political subjects; others were con-  versing on the subject of religion; others were discussing domestic affairs and managements.  These last were mostly elderly ladies, who were  "at home" on no other subject. The juniors,  who were seated together, were chatting, in  suppressed voices, on music, dress, beauty, and fashion. The supper ended and   thanks returned,   Mr. Atherton again took leave of absence, and repaired to the kitchen. Here he found the beggar just licking his plate. "Poor fellow!" said Mr. Atherton. "Here, Juba!. Is this obeying my orders?" (pointing to the empty plate of the beggar.) "Did I not tell  you to give him the best, and enough of it?" "Yes, massa, you sartin did; but den he so famish, dat he sartin kill hesef eatin', ef he  did'n hev to pick he wittels off de bone mouful  to time." "Very true, Juba, -  true; but he must have more directly. - Do you feel satisfied for the present, my poor fellow?"   WAIT ANSI SEE.      95 "Oh, yes! Heaven bless you! Yes!" "Had you anywhere in view for lodging to-night ' " "I hoped," stammered the poor wretch, "that your reverence --- "Yes: I comprehend. You shall have a lodging and breakfast: and- perhaps I can help you to find employment to-morrow; that is, if you desire it." "Bless your dear, reverend soul!  Just what I hoped to find." "Juba, make him a comfortable lodging: I leave that arrangement to your kind, careful old hands, my boy. If he craves more food, give to him according to- your own judgment. I must return now." The evening was passed very pleasantly by all, especially by Mr. Atherton; for he felt the truth of the remark, that, " in blessing others, we win happiness to ourselves, both at the present and in the future." At ten o'clock, the visitors thought it time to return home; for "Early to bed, and early  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7378-00000051"/> 96      WAIT AND SEE. to rise," had been the motto of many of them from their earliest years.           m Before parting, the pastor knelt in their midst, and offered a fervent prayer for bless- X ings and mercies on all present, and all absent, of every grade and condition, throughout the f human family. After many expressions of civility and polite- ness, and, in some cases, of Christian love, they departed. Old Juba bowed the carriages  through the gate with the utmost obsequious-  ness; saying to each as they passed, "Good- night, massa! hope you had bery good wisit." This question was generally answered by a silver coin. "Goramighty bress you, massa!" was the rejoinder. Mrs. Dorset had been prevailed on to spend a  week at the parsonage; and the Huntleys had decided to prolong their stay another week at the Crown  and Anchor, as they wished to call on several of their new acquaint- ances,-- Aunt Nabby in particular.  Mrs. Dorset had engaged to accompany them, as she had closed her school for a week's recess.

OLD JUBA'S DISCOVERY. - THE DISGUISE. - THE SECRET DISCLOSED.- JUBA WAKES THE WRONG PASSENGER.- THE DILEMMA. - THE JOYFUL SURPRISE. - MEETING OF THE LOVERS. ON the night of the party, old Juba had conducted the beggar to his lodging, after requesting him to take out the contents of his pockets to show that he had no rum, tinder, or matches. (Juba had at last given up the hope that had made his eye shine through all his fatigue of that long evening.) When they were alone, said Juba, "Wish I knowed one ting, massa." "And what is that 1 If I can tell you, I will; you've been very good to me." "Well, den, am you real beggar . or is you oney gemman in diskies \." "What a question, Juba! Come in here in about fifteen minutes or so, and you shall know all."  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7378-00000053"/> 100      WAIT AND SEE. As soon as the old fellow had vanished, the beggar threw off his wig of matted hair, his false beard, eye-patch, and tattered clothes, and with them the hump of his back. He now washed his face and brushed his hair. He had slipped into Mr. Theodore's sleeping- room to do this. He then returned in the suit of rich clothing he had worn beneath his rags, and awaited the return of old Juba. Directly he heard him advancing; and, looking up, he saw the old fellow spell-bound with astonish- ment, his eyes dilated with something between joy and affright. "It am Mas'r Ed'ard or de Debble, one tudder!" cried Juba, and attempted to run; but the ex-beggar gently detained him, saying, "It is, indeed, your Master Edward, Juba." The poor old fellow was quite overcome with the intensity of his feelings. "Goramighty bress you!" cried he with convulsed sobs, grasping the extended hand of his young master; for the poor fellow thought his Master Edward had lost every thing, and become very poor.   WAIT AND SEE.      101 "Can you keep a secret, Juba t I used to trust you, and will now; but keep dark (a rather useless caution, by the way), and I'll tell you all. Sit down; for you must be very weary." "Neber tired when Massa Ed'ard here." "'Well, Juba, you know I left here - that is, America - about seven years ago. You recollect the cause of my going?'" ," Not 'zactly, Massa Ed'ard." "Why, don't you remember my being almost distracted about a young lady from Boston, named Alexa Winthrop, who was then visiting at her uncle's in Philadelphia? I told you all about it at the time. She rejected me on the plea of a prior engagement. My friends never knew the cause of my leaving so abruptly. You never told them my secret, Juba'?" "Neber, massa. I no Judicus; 'pend on dat." "Where is she now Do you know, Juba'?" I neber know, massa. 'Haps she dead 'fore dis time." Edward Atherton sighed deeply, and re- 9*  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7378-00000054"/> 102     WAIT AND SEE. sumed his story. "On leaving here, I sailed for Europe; thence to the East Indies. Suffice it, for the present, to tell you that I have re- turned, not a beggar, but a millionnaire. But, remember, you must not drop one hint, even to my brother. Oh! I could scarcely refrain from throwing my arms around him when he was treating me so kindly as a beggar; but that would have defeated my plan. Now, Juba, not a hint of my real wealth until the right time." "No, massa: me keep brack, bress de Lord!" "We are all weary to-night.   I will not undeceive them until morning, but shall quit my disguise then. It was a whim of mine to see if he still retained the same noble, generous heart. God bless him! Oh! I can scarcely wait for the morning; but, on the whole, I will strive to subdue my feelings, they are all so weary, and it is so late. Now show me the lodging that I should probably occupy had I been recognized as their brother. They have a spare lodging, I suppose." "Oh, yes! dis ole house big 'nough to hole   WAIT AND SEE.      103 dozen. I show you, Massa Eddy: dis way. Missis' bes' -front-chamber none too good, guess." On reaching the door, he gave Edward the light, saying softly, "Right in dare, massa." "Stay," whispered Edward.  "Come up softly in the morning, and wake me very early; then go down, and, after a few mo- ments, tell my brother and family that you have been up to the room, but that the beggar had gone, and left his old rags and scalp there. He will then come up to see if he can find out about it, just as I would have him. That's all. Now go. Good-night!" Edward, with light tread, entered the cham- ber; but, feeling disinclined to sleep, he set down the light, and, throwing himself into an old great-chair, sat absorbed in a deep revery, when he heard light footsteps approaching the door of his room, and two silvery, female voices exchanging "Good-night!" There was not a moment to lose. He covered his light, and sprang into a closet, the door of which was standing open, and closed the door without  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7378-00000055"/> 104     WAIT AND SEE. latching it. The next instant, he heard the footsteps of one of the ladies enter the room he had just left. He must have been no grandson of Eve not to just peep through the aperture of the door to see if she was going to tarry for the night, when he saw a vision of the most perfect loveliness, although not youthful, and in the habiliments of deep mourning. She set her light down at the very spot where he had placed his, and knelt in prayer. He then felt it dishonorable to look any longer. It was now evident that she was to sleep there. He was beginning to feel very mean and uncomfortable; indeed, he felt at his " wits' end;" when, looking to the far end of the closet by the dim light of his partially covered lamp, he espied an opening, partly co- vered by a long curtain. He scudded through it, and, unperceived by any one, regained the chamber he had been first conducted to by Juba. "Thank the Lord!" said he, letting out his pent-up breath. The family at the parsonage were very weary, and, one after another, were dropping   WAIT AND SEE.      105 into sleep; but others could not feel composed, much less sleep. Theodore Atherton, meditating on the lovely Arielle Huntley, could not think of sleep. Old Juba was wakeful with perfect delight, thinking of "Massa Eddy." Edward himself felt too much excited with his adventures, es- pecially the last, to close his eyes in slumber; for the face, of which he had but half a glance, was strangely familiar. He racked his brains the whole night to try to think where he had seen that face. Mrs. Dorset- for it was she who had en- tered the spare front-chamber, as our readers will perceive-felt agitated and wakeful; hav- ing heard something, as she imagined, in the closet, soon after she entered her room; in- tending, if she heard it again, to investigate the cause. Young Fanny slept sweetly in her loveliness. Blessed age of innocence, careless- ness, and delight! The next morning, the inmates of the par- sonage arose very cheerful, if not bright. Juba, at the dawn, went up stealthily to wake  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7378-00000056"/> 106     WAIT AND SEE. his "Massa Edward" according to appoint- ment. He entered the room on tip-toe, and advanced to the bed, and was just putting down his mouth to wake him, when he was trans- fixed with astonishment to find instead a beau- tiful lady, sweetly sleeping, with one fair hand thrown out upon the counterpane. Old Juba turned pale, and fled as if from the presence of a tiger, nearly distracted with affright. He rushed to the chamber where he had first conducted Edward; and there he sat, already dressed, and looking very eager. "Gorry massy, Mas'r Ed'ard, what all dis mean?"  Edward explained it all in a few words. "But who is that beautiful lady, Juba?" "I dun know, massa, less tis de teacheress. I go ax Miss Fanny." "Not now. Go and tell them what I bade you last night. You remember what to say?" "Yes, massa." And the old fellow scam- pered down stairs, looking greatly surprised, with "Missis, dat ole beggar gone. Nowhere   WAIT AND SEE.      107 in de house. Left all he ole rags an' hat an' he wig. Ha, he, he! O missis, I 'spect he am de bery Debble!" "Oh, no, Juba! I hope not, but hope your master will find him some employment to-day, and that he will go away finally; for I feel rather afraid of him. Who knows but he is a thief, disguised as a beggar?" "Sure 'nuf, missis. Here come massa. Massa, dat ole fellow gone, an' left all he old duds." "What duds, Juba?" "Why, he ole hat an' rags an' so fort. Massa, jes go up, an' I show you where him stop." "Never mind now, Juba: let him go, if he chooses." "But, massa, he cloves all left. He no go widout he closes." "I'll see what has become of him. Where did you put him?" "In de old porch-chamber, massa." Mr. Atherton ascended the back-stairs with hasty strides; for he felt rather surprised at the  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7378-00000057"/> 108      WAIT AND SEE. account given by the old African. He hastily opened the door, and entered the room. "My dear brother!" was the simultaneous exclama- tion of both, as they rushed into each other's arms; and, in that fond, fraternal embrace, we will leave them for a while. Juba came up to know if he might inform the rest of the family then. "Yes," replied Mr. Atherton: " call my wife, Theodore, and Fanny." And such a rush! and what excla- mations of surprise and joy! - all talking to- gether at the top of their voices, old Juba's a few notes higher than the rest. "Did'n I tell you, massa, when he fus kum, he no beggar? I 'scover him fust! Gorry! Ha, ha, he!" After the joyful excitement had abated a little, they all went down to the breakfast- room. Mrs. Dorset had risen early, and passed down the front-stairs, and was in the garden gathering flowers, entirely unconscious of what was passing within doors. But she was soon summoned to come in and partake of the gene- ral joy. She was introduced to the stranger, but appeared less self-possessed than usual;   WAIT AND SEE.      109 and a delicate tinge was just discernible on her usually pale cheek. Edward appeared greatly embarrassed, and blushed even to his temples. All this was too visible not to be observed, and established the fact, that they had met be- fore. 10  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7378-00000058"/> "O CHAPTER XVII.

No one seemed inclined to partake of the nice breakfast which had been served up with so much care, and it was removed nearly untast- ed. The embarrassment was contagious, and conversation became studied labor. Mrs. iDor-- set, whose heart was buried with her unfor- tunate husband, could look on Edward in no other light than she did his married brother, or at best as a brother to herself. Bu't would he view her in that light? She saw and felt that he still cherished his first love; and, though hopeless, it could not be transferred to another. True, she feared no direct expres- sion of it: it was the indirect expression of it she feared, which conveys more meaning than words, and is more difficult to check.   'WAIT AND SEE.     1" She was devising something as a plea for returning home; but, as she had engaged to spend the week, she could think of no truth- ful excuse, and could not if she would, and would not if she could, use dissimulation or make false pretences. She therefore came to the conclusion to remain, and to treat Edward precisely as she would had she never seen him before.  She had just arrived at this conclusion, when the Huntleys approached the gate on horse- back, and halted to invite the inmates of the parsonage to join them in their early ride. "Pray alight, and come in," said Mr. Ather- ton, " long enough to congratulate us; and then we will either accompany you, or compel you to stay with us, or let you pass, or per- haps all three." "Capital!" exclaimed Mr. Huntley, gayly dismounting, after receiving from his wife a nod of assent to his inquiring look. Miss Arielle had already reached the ground, thanks to the gallantry/ of Mr. Theo- dore; Mr. Atherton had very politely handed  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7378-00000059"/> "2      WAIT AND SEE. Mrs. Huntley from the saddle; while Master Fred was coming round the spacious yard on his pony, eying Fanny the while to see if she was looking at him, and if she looked pleased. They were now introduced to Edward, and much courtesy and congratulation ensued; but, when they were informed that he was the beggar of last night, they were highly amused, and voted him the " lion of the day." It was now time, as Mr. Huntley smilingly remarked to the pastor, to decide on "the ex- ercises of the day." "Ladies," said Mr. Atherton, "will you ob- lige us by making the arrangements yourselves just as you prefer to have them?" "That's right, brother," said Edward. "I am delighted to find that you indorse ' woman's rights;' for ' the very first man did the very first woman obey,' you know." "Capital!" was echoed by the whole as with one voice. Mrs. Atherton, being unanimously elected as directress in the case before them, replied, that, for herself, she must beg to be excused from   WAIT AND SEE.      113 going out, as her presence would be required at home all the morning; but she would not be so selfish as to ask either of the ladies to remain with her, and forego the pleasure of their ride on such a lovely morning, although it would be so very agreeable to her; said she should expect them all to take dinner with her, and wished them to consider that as a settled point; for she must use her authority as direc- tress, if they would not otherwise surrender. Mrs. Dorset volunteered to remain, if it would not interfere with Mrs. Atherton's do- mestic duties. Mrs. Huntley expressed the same wish; saying it would give her far more pleasure to remain, if Mrs. Atherton was quite suret that she would be no hinderance or at all in the way. 1"By no means," joyfully replied Mrs. Atherton. "I am delighted with your kind decision, if not too great a sacrifice." It was decided that all the gentlemen, with Arielle and Fanny, should proceed to the ride; but Edward, finding that " nobody " was going, and that " everybody" was to be left at home, wisely made the important discovery, that he 10*  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7378-00000060"/> "4      WAIT AND SEE. was very much fatigued. Besides, it rather appeared ungallant to leave the ladies at home and alone: he could not think of it; hoped they would excuse him, and enjoy their ride. "I will not urge you, dear brother-" said Mr. Atherton; " nor can I leave you: I could' not have you so long out of my sight." "The ride will be spoiled for us all, ma bon- nie beggar," said Huntley, " unless you grace and bless it with your presence." "That compliment deserves a suitable re- turn. I must not be ungrateful," said Edward, as he sprang, laughing, into the saddle, and went off like the wind. The rest joyfully followed. When within hailing distance, The- odore, with a-military air of authority and command, cried, "Halt!"Edward, wheeling gracefully round, rode up to Arielle in his best style of gallantry, and, with a profound bow, requested the pleasure of being her escort for the remainder of the ride. She felt quite em- barrassed, but too polite to refuse so civil a request. She thanked him, and accepted. The two rode off in fine style, and left Theodore to   WAIT AND SEE.      115 brood over his loss in silence, secretly hoping that Arielle would not be pleased at all with his uncle. Poor fellow! he would not have felt so uncomfortable had he known that Ed- ward had no other motive or thought than to neutralize the effect of his blushing embarrass- ment in the morning, when introduced to Mrs. Dorset, and to turn suspicion, if there was any, in the wrong direction. Theodore, being a tolerable tactician, as- sumed perfect composure and nonchalance; making the best of Fred and Fanny for com- panions, who would gladly have dispensed with his company then, agreeable as it might be at all other times. A little before dinner-time, our equestrian party were seen dashing up to the gate of the parsonage with flushed faces and in very high spirits. They found the three ladies who tar- ried at the house, like the three sister Graces,- Faith, Hope, and Charity, - enjoying sweet converse and interchange of thought; and, above all, true Christian union and fellow- ship.  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7378-00000061"/> "6      WAIT AND' SEE. After the dinner, - which was' partaken of with excellent relish by all, enlivened as it was with refined, intellectual, and moral sentiments, --the next discussion was, how were they to spend the afternoon to most advantage and enjoyment? They finally concluded, as the weather was very fine, to spend it out of doors in some way.  The three eldest ladies had ma- tured their own plan, and had agreed to be exclusives for a few hours, with the permission of the rest of the company. The gentlemen were compelled by common courtesy to say, "Certainly."- "But, pray, make short mea- sure of the hours that we are to be banished again from your society, precious beings, the love-lights of our existence!" said Edward with enthusiasm. The three oldest gentlemen thought they might as well fill the interval of time ensuing by going on a fishing excursion. This plan was perfectly delightful to the four young people, as it would leave them to enjoy a fine ramble wherever they chose, unshackled by the presence of dignity and sedate years.   WAIT AND SEE.      117 ,The fishers, with old Juba in high glee car- rying the fishing tackle, set out elated with hopes of luck. The girls with their sun-bon- nets, Theodore and Freddy with a basket, knife, shears, and other implements for gather- ing mosses, or whatever else the young ladies might wish to obtain, set out for the old forest. The three elder ladies then took their sun- shades, and set out on their pedestrian tour of calls; intending to call on the plain neighbors generally, and Aunt Nabby in particular. As they entered her house, in passing a low win- dow, they discovered that now changed woman so intently perusing the " good old Book" (having been taught privately by Mrs. Dorset), that she did not perceive them until the pon- derous old iron ring fell heavily from the slen- der fingers of Mrs. Dorset. Aunt Nabby was quite surprised at first; but soon overcame her embarrassment, and welcomed them very heartily. "We are sorry to interrupt you, Sister Dar- ley, when we find you so profitably engaged  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7378-00000062"/> "8      WAIT AND SEE. in obeying our blessed Saviour s injunctions to search the Scriptures,'" said Mrs. Atherton. "Law sakes," replied Aunt Nabby, c' you don't know nothin' how glad I be to hev you all come to see a poor plain body like me. Take cheers, all on ye,--do; and pull off your things. I must run and call Darley, or the fat will all be in the fire." She then went out and told her husband. Uncle Ben needed no second bidding; but, dropping his work, went directly to the stone at the well, and washed his face and hands, rolled down his shirt-sleeves, combed his hair, put on his best coat, and came in to welcome the ladies to his " old hut," as he expressed it. Christian love subdued all feeling of greater or less in this gospel-charmed circle, and they spent an hour together as they all hoped to spend eternity. At length Mrs. Atherton said, "We  must not trespass longer on your time, Brother Dar- ley. Let us not detain you from your work a moment longer: but I   have a little private business respecting domestic affairs with Sister   WAIT AND SEE.      119 Darley; and if my two friends would like a ramble about the grounds the while, and will excuse us for a few moments " "Certainly," replied both ladies; and, taking each other's arm, they sauntered forth without any definite aim. As they approached a green, mossy bank near the river, said Mrs. Dorset, "Shall we pause a few moments here?" "It would be delightful to me," replied Mrs. Huntley. They seated themselves, and made a few re- marks on the beauty of the scene, the weather, &amp;c.; when Mrs. Dorset, after sadly musing for a few moments, looked her friend in the face, saying, "You know my sad story." "I do, my love; and feel a sister's sympathy for you, even more than I can express." "How can I ever express my gratitude 1" replied Mrs. Dorset, 1" or how shall I be able to part with you? And yet I feel the time is speeding with doubly swift wings which will separate us, perhaps for ever. I must then return to my humble home and my humble duties. Oh, how desolate!"  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7378-00000063"/> 120     WAIT AND SEE. Mrs. Huntley was deeply affected, and an- swered by only a pressure of the hand; but what amount of feeling, sympathy, and love, can be thusexpressed! "That small brown house, just over the river," continued Mrs. Dorset, " is my home; and, though humble, it is home. But I can- not invite you to go and enter it. Heaven forgive my sinful pride! But, so long as I in- habit that abode of poverty, I cannot invite any but the poor- poorer than myself- to pass its threshold." "But, my dearest, you certainly cannot think of spending the winter here. It would be impracticable. Besides, we have resolved to prevail on you to spend the winter in the city with us; and we hope for a much longer time. Nay, my dear, lone dove, do not refuse us: we have all set our hearts on it. You will con- sent, love; I know you will: I read it in your eyes," said Mrs. Huntley eagerly. Mrs. Dorset grasped the hand of her friend, while large tears coursed down her pale cheeks, saying, "Do not think me ungrateful, my more   WAIT AND SEE.      121 than friend. I fully appreciate your delicate, generous invitation; but, oh! my blessed, comforting angel, I cannot leave this humble home, for many reasons. Perhaps you might think one of them was pride; for I must not, cannot, be dependent on but one Being, while he gives me ability to earn a very humble in- dependence." "But you must not compromise your com- fort and health, and perhaps your life, by remaining in this cold, damp place for the winter. Just reflect a moment, love; and you will see there can be no dependent feel- ings for you where the obligation would be all on our side. Think of that, dear; and not feel sensitive, as though you were going to receive a favor. You can be just as retired at our residence as you please; for we have plenty of room and help, and every means of enjoyment that earth can yield, but find our greatest happiness in communion with our blessed Lord, and in endeavoring to follow his precepts and obey his commands. There, my dear sister, we could worship God together in "  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7378-00000064"/> 122      WAIT AND SEE. sweet communion. Will you not reconsider my proposal? It will undoubtedly be for the happiness of both and all of us." "I fear I shall find it difficult to resist your entreaties and my own inclinations, when unit- ed; but I fear it will be impossible to gratify your benevolent wish, although I could almost sacrifice my views of humble independence rather than be separated from my Heaven-sent friend. I will take a little time for reconside- ration, if you please; and converse with Mr. and Mrs. Atherton on the subject. "That's a dear! I thought you would not be so - so positive as to pain us by a refusal," said Mrs. Huntley joyfully.   123 CHAPTER XVIII. THE SECRET. - THE PEACHES. - THE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE COQUETTE, LIZZIE. "THERE is something that I wish to communi- cate to you, my dear friend," said Mrs. Dorset, "to be in strict confidence; into which even your husband, and more especially the Ather- tons, may not be admitted. Have I your leave to proceed t" "Certainly, dearest." "I wish to avoid one, who, I fear, has not quite forgotten the Alexa of former years; not only on my own account, but his. It is Edward Atherton, the brother of our pastor; who arrived last night, disguised as a beggar, you know." She then related the whole par- ticulars respecting him, from first to last, to her surprised but interested and attentive hearer.  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7378-00000065"/> 124      WAIT AND SEE.  4 "Why, my dear Mrs. Dorset," said her friend, " great changes are sometimes effected by time,--changes in the human mind. I am greatly obliged by your confidence, and will assist you to carry out any plan you may adopt respecting it. He will doubtless seek your presence whenever he can with propriety. Could you not just admit Mr. Huntley to this confidence? He would sooner die than betray a trust; and his advice and co-operation would be more efficient than mine could possibly be." "I will not object, then, to admitting him through the best of mediums, if you accept the office of the communication, and will take the responsibility of his not thinking it perfectly ridiculous, and unworthy of his at- tention or notice." "I will be responsible at all points on that score; and shall consult him before I sleep, lest he should invite Edward to make our house his home in the city this winter: for I will keep the fox from finding my cherished bird, you may depend," said Mrs. Huntley   WAIT AND SEE.      125 playfully. "But, to be serious, do you not think that time will alter your views respecting him?" "Mrs. Huntley, I esteem him very highly; but my heart can never wed: it has gone with my poor, dear William," said Mrs. Dorset, sobbing with subdued grief. They now observed that Mrs. Atherton was waving her handkerchief from Uncle Ben's door, apparently soliciting their return to the house. As they entered, Aunt Nabby said, "We begun to be consarmed about you. So I axed Sister Atherton ef she hadn't better call you in, for fear you would ketch cold. Come, set right down an' rest ye; do. Annie and Lizzie have gone arter some of them fall peaches, down to the lower eend of the lot. I guess they can find a few meller ones." "Thank you, Sister Darley," replied the ladies. Directly, in came the two little girls, courte- sying in their best style to the ladies in ge- neral, and to Mrs. Dorset in particular; and Uncle Ben behind them, - with a basketful "*  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7378-00000066"/> 126     WAIT AND SEE. of ripe, mellow peaches, -looking so pleased and happy. Aunt Nabby had invited them to stay to supper. This they declined; but gathered around the peaches, which had been turned out into the best milk-pan, and placed in the middle of the room, on an old-fashioned round tea-table. The ladies thought them the most delicious peaches .they had tasted that season; but when they dared not" touch another one," not even to gratify their kind entertainers, Uncle Ben said that he would send the boys, when they came in from work, to carry the remainder of the peaches home for the ladies. To this kind offer they consented, intending to return the basket not empty. The little girls both looked quite neat and very pretty. But Lizzie was perfectly beauti- ful: no painter's dream could imagine any thing more lovely. Mrs. Huntley was fas- cinated with the rare beauty of this miniature "star." She tried to see the children both alike; but, like selfish persons, one eye would see more than the other. She invited Uncle   WAIT AND SEE.      127 Ben and Aunt Nabby to call on her at the Crown and Anchor, and to bring the little girls with them, before she left. This invita- tion was very pleasing to the Darleys: and they promised to call, if possible, themselves; if not, the little ones might come at any time, if Mrs. Huntley would like to have them.  "But you must endeavor to come yourselves with them. I have a proposal to make: so I hope you will not fail of coming." The ladies then took their leave, and re- turned directly to the parsonage; being too much fatigued to extend their walk or make any more calls that afternoon.  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7378-00000067"/> 128 CHAPTER XTX. THE FISH-CHOWDER. - RETURNING HOME. THE gentlemen had returned in buoyant spirits; having been very successful, and taken some excellent fish, which were being cooked in various ways for supper. Old Juba was perfectly wild with delight, being dubbed chief cook of the chowder. He said, "It take dis ole brackey to do dis 'ere kind o' ting, massa."-"It certainly does, Juba. Your chowders are always excellent." A boy had been sent to the forest to invite the young ramblers to return for supper while it was warm. Another messenger was de- spatched, in the direction the three ladies had taken; to hasten their return; and met them but a short distance from the parsonage. On entering, the ladies found " all hands" bustling about with an air of business-like   WAIT AND SEE.      129 importance and activity.- Great preparations were making to serve up the supper. Just then, gay voices were heard approaching: and the young ladies came bounding in, with rich bloom mantling their happy faces; Theodore and Frederic closely following with a basket filled with mosses, wild flowers, &amp;c., which Arielle and Fanny had only to look at to receive. Mrs. Huntley strove to remonstrate against such unheard-of intrusion as coming early in the morning, the day after making a formal visit, and spending the whole day. She feared it was " really imposing on the politeness and hospitality" of their friends. But all this was soon overruled by the Athertons, and they were all seated at the spacious supper-table. By some unaccountable oversight of old Juba, who held the double office of chief waiter as well as cook, Edward was seated next to Mrs. Dorset. Of course, it was purely accidental; but still there was a twinkle lurking in the corner of old Juba's eye, that was any thing but innocent.  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7378-00000068"/> 130      WAIT AND SEE. The supper, which was savory enough to regale the palate of a devoted epicure, was partaken of with the highest relish and satis- faction by the happy circle around it. Just as they had finished the lhst course, and the table was about to be dismissed, the two Darleys (Alfred and Ezra) entered the side- door, bearing a large basket of beautiful, mellow peaches, and two fine, large melons. They had intrusted them to Juba, and were passing out of the yard, when Mrs. Atherton chanced to see them, and sent to call them back, and to request them to wait a few moments.  The peaches and melons were served at table, and gave a splendid finishing touch to the feast. The young Darleys were invited to take supper; but, being rather diffident, declined. Mrs. Atherton then gave Juba an order in an undertone. The boys were then beckoned by Juba to follow him to the kitchen. When they had entered, Juba, with an earnest look, said, "Missis say you mus' hev some she nice, good chowder (I make um) i an' she want to know ef you drudder   WAIT AND SEE.      131 heb it out here, kaze you 'fused in tudder room 'mongst de gentlems and mis-iladies. I take you up good mess: come!" The boys were nothing loath, but enjoyed the excellent supper with a keen relish; being plentifully helped to every thing on the other table, and the; fruit also. When they had finished their supper, and received a lecture on the subject of chowder-making in general from Juba, they rose to depart. Their basket was filled with nice things, and a large tin pail full of chowder -enough for the whole family--was sent to their mother. Thus we see that kindness may be recipro- cated between persons of different grade, mind, and manner, if the opportunity is but sought. And it is worth seeking. General friendship is very desirable in a community, and can be obtained in no other way than the reciproca- tion of kindness and benevolence. The ladies being fatigued, the horses were taken back to the Crown and Anchor, and the carriage brought over to convey them home. The Athertons pleaded for Arielle to spend  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7378-00000069"/> 132      WAIT AND SEE. the night, as the. young people averred that there were many more things that they wished to procure from the forest. Mrs. Huntley consented, on the condition that Mrs. Dorset should fill her place in the carriage, and return with them to spend the night; for Mrs. Huntley had observed Edward very closely at supper, and perceived that he felt greatly embarrassed, although he strove to appear easy, and to treat Mrs. Dorset with the same courtesy he would have proffered to a stranger thus situated. She felt that Mrs. Dorset would gladly avail her- self of any admissible plea for absenting herself from the parsonage, under present circum- stances. So it was, after much debate, ac- ceded that Mrs. Dorset, if she would return early the next day, should be suffered to go home with them for that one night. Edward looked dissatisfied and sorrowful on hearing this decision, but, lover-like, forbore any re- monstrance. The parting "Good-night" hav- ing been said by all, the carriage drove off, carrying with it the first and last beloved of Edward Atherton.   133 CHAPTER XX. TH}E ADOPTED CHLD. - BUSINESS. - PARTING OF THE LoVERS. - RETURN TO BOSTON. THE next morning, instead of the return of Mrs. Dorset, an invitation was sent to the parsonage for all its inmates to spend the day with the Huntleys at the Crown and Anchor (not omitting old Juba); as Mr. Huntley's presence was required in the city, and they intended to return the next day. Vhis was unwelcome tidings to all the Athertons; but they felt that they must submit, though with much regret. At an early hour, Mr. Huntley's carriage was sent for the ladies, and all who chose to ride over; and the day was spent very plea- santly, but not gayly. Each had thoughts and regrets which were exclusively their own. But, when it was announced that Mrs. Dorset was to accompany them home to spend the 12  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7378-00000070"/> 134      WAIT AND SEE. winter, it was received with undisguised asto- nishment and regret by all except poor Edward: he looked pale and sorrowful, but uttered not a syllable. Mrs. Dorset was obliged to go to her own house, and see to the selection and packing of her wardrobe for the winter.  The two ladies accompanied her as far as Mr. Darley's, and Juba went to take her trunks to the inn. Mrs. Atherton undertook to see to her affairs, and to call the school together, and dismiss them in the name and with the blessing of Mrs. Dorset. When Uncle Ben and Aunt Nabby were informed of the intended departure of their best earthly friend, both shed tears of genuine sorrow at the thought of being separated from her, though but for the winter. Mrs. Huntley asked if they could consent to spare their little Lizzie for the winter, and let her go in Mrs. Dorset's care. At this unexpected proposal they hesitated. How could they part with her? They could not answer : each waited for the other to speak. Mrs. Huntley continued:   WAIT AND SEE.      135 "She shall receive every kindness, and be instructed in every thing that she is capable of learning; and will be -in Mrs. Dorset's charge [the two ladies had arranged all that between themselves]. Will you spare her ." Still they could not consent, though they feared it would not be prudent to refuse such an offer, and from such a source. They felt greatly tried. They were very anxious to have her well educated, - and, their other children too, if possible, - but saw no way to do it in their present circumstances, unless they accepted aid when so kindly offered. Mrs. tHuntley perceived the struggle of their feelings, and wisely forbore to urge them far- ther; saying, "You will want to reflect a little before giving a decided answer. Suppose you both come and take dinner with us to-day; and we can then decide it. Mr. Huntley has taken a liking to your sons. The oldest (Alfred), he says, he would take, and give him a good education, and then fit him for the mercantile business, and set him up, .at a suitable age, for himself, if he proves trusty  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7378-00000071"/> 136      WAIT AND SEE. and obedient as an apprentice; that is, if both yourselves and Alfred are willing. Think it over carefully; and come to dinner with us,- will ye not?" They were both so much agitated,--pleased and yet sorrowful, - that they were unable to say more than to express their thanks and promise to come to dinner.  While Mrs. Huntley's attention was attracted by some- thing out in the grounds, Mrs. Dorset took the opportunity of saying to Aunt Nabby, "It is an offer that you may never have again, and from such excellent people too; and, if you have confidence in me, I will be as a mother to them." At this, Aunt Nabby held her apron to her eyes, sobbing, "How can!" "Look to Heaven for wisdom, dear sister," replied Mrs. Dorset; "for wisdom to seek their best good, even at the sacrifice of your own present enjoyment." The ladies now bade "Good-morning!" After their departure, Uncle Ben and Aunt Nabby held a long consultation together, and made these things a subject of prayer. They   WAIT AND SEE.      137 were finally led to the conclusion that their family must eventually separate, if ever they were to get on in the world and. have any education. They were severely tried; but, after deep reflection, both felt that they must embrace so good an offer, and sacrifice their own feelinos to the benefit of their children. After settling this in their minds,. they were more composed; and changed their dress, preparatory to going to the Hunitleys'. They were kindly greeted, and received the most cordial attentions from all. Uncle Ben sought a private interview with his pastor and spiritual guide to ask his advice in this affair. "Let them go, by all means, Brother Darley: it will be for their best interest, and yours too, eventually. I know it is hard to part with our children at any time; but, if we must let them go from our sight, it is certainly best to choose the most advantageous opportunity." A capital dinner was served up in the Huntley apartments, to which the host and hostess were politely invited. Though the repast was excellent, no one appeared to feel 12*  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7378-00000072"/> 138     WAIT AND SEE. the least relish for food; for each one was pondering his own secret thoughts. True, the Boltons attempted to dispel the pensive- ness that was resting on the mind and brow of each individual, by their witty facetiousness and jocular remarks: but they did not feel very gay; for they were about to lose the most profitable guests they had ever entertained. Soon after rising from the table, the Boltons were required by the arrival of a number of new guests, and begged to be excused. The younger part of the company sauntered about the garden and grounds. Edward walked gloomily on the bank of a stream, alone. The room was now left vacant for business. Mr. Huntley then made the same proposals to the Darleys that his wife had done in the morn- ing; offering to adopt the little Lizzie as their own, if his wife should desire it, at the expira- tion of one month of her residence with them. With trembling voices, they both consentedl to accede to his proposals. Alfred and Lizzie were to be at the Crown and Anchor the next day, early in the after-   WAIT AND SEE.      139 noon. Mr. iHuntley bade their parents have no anxious thoughts about the children's clothing, as he would supply that as soon as they were settled at home.  The children were to go sometimes to see their parents, and the parents were invited to visit them. The Darleys left soon after to make the necessary preparations, and to be with the children as much as possible before parting with them. They felt the truth of a remark which they had never heard, that- "Blessings brighten as they take their flight." On arriving at home, Aunt Nabby wept for a long time with convulsive sobs. At length, Uncle Ben, as soon as he could clear his throat of a choking sensation, said, "Poh, Nabby! 'tis childish. We can see them sometimes." But his lip quivered as he, said it. The children were called in, and told what was to take place. Alfred, boy-like, was in raptures at the thought of going to live with the Huntleys at their city home. Ezra looked sad and dissatisfied at being one of the "non-  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7378-00000073"/> "O     WAIT AND SEE. elect," but did not utter a word. Anna wept long and loud; crying, "I want to go: let me go." Lizzie neither spoke nor smiled, but stood as if spell-bound. At length, with a proud, stern look, she stamped with her tiny foot, saying, "'Top 'at noise, g'eat baby!" The children who were to go were now fitted for their departure as well as the short- ness of the time would allow. How often that sorrowful mother paused to gaze on the sweet, lovely face of her youngest darling, and breathe a long-drawn, heavy sigh, to think how soon the dark curtain of separation was to be drawn between them! A deep, heart- felt prayer was put up that night, by these uneducated but Christian parents, for the safety and protection of all their children, and more especially for those who were to leave the home hearthstone, and be trained by other hands than theirs. They had thus far been trained to honesty, industry, and subordination. Had they been reared on the " moral-suasion" plan, it is doubtful whether the Huntleys would have volunteered to take them in   WAIT AND SEE.     141 charge; for a wilful, ungoverned child is not very desirable, unless to its too fond parents. The next day, at the appointed hour, the father and mother repaired to the inn with Alfred and Lizzie; looking, we may suppose, as did the patriarch, when ascending Mount Moriah to sacrifice his son. Mrs. Dorset said every cheerful, hopeful thing to them; as did also the Athertons. Mrs. Huntley, after assuring them again and again that their children should be well and kindly cared for while with her family, sent very handsome presents to the other two who remained at home. Mr. Huntley then slipped something into Uncle Ben's hand, which had every ap- pearance of being a roll of bank-bills; and said something to him, in a tone so low that no ear but the onie for which it was intended could hear: but the "Heaven bless you, sir!" from Uncle Ben, left no one in doubt. May that noble donor be an example that. will be followed by all whom God has blessed- with  ample means, and of whom he requires faith- ful stewardship!  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7378-00000074"/> "2      WAIT AND SEE. An affectionate leave being taken of the Athertons, and a very cordial one of all, the travellers moved to depart.  As Mrs. Dorset was entering the carriage, she caught the fixed gaze of Edward Atherton. And such an expression of tenderness, regret, and despair, as shaded that handsome face! She could not see it with indifference: it blanched her cheeks to a marble hue. He espied it, and a ray of hope brightened in his noble heart and speaking eye. The younger mem- bers of both families had exchanged regrets and hopes and keepsakes, but were silent at the final parting. Alfred and Lizzie were in ecstasies to ride in such a beautiful carriage; scarcely heeding their sorrowful parents, who stood strain- ing their eyes to see their children, until they were out of sight, and still gazed where they had last seen them.   "3 CHAPTER XXI. MRS. BOLTON'S NEW CARPET. -THE DUTIFUL HUSBAND.-- ABSENCE OF MND. RYEFIELD seemed a perfect blank to the bereft friends who remained in it. Edward soon dis- covered that important business called him to Philadelphia for a few weeks. Theodore was to enter the University at Cambridge in about a month; and this event had long been looked forward to with regret by his family, as it would leave them so lonely, and he would be missed so much. Alas! parting with dearest friends has ever been the lot of the human family; but then they always hope to meet, and part no more. The thought is sweet. The Darleys, after pining in sorrow for a long time, at length regained their usual cheer- fulness, and pursued the " even tenor of their way."  The Boltons counted up their gains through the liberality of the Huntleys, which  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7378-00000075"/> "4      WAIT AND SEE. had added substantially to their coffers. But Mrs. Bolton declared, that, out of that money, she would have a carpet for her best parlor, of something fit to be seen; a new silk-dress, a silk-velvet cloak, and a new chain for her gold watch. To this piece of information her worthy spouse merely snapped his fingers, with a long, shrill whistle, which stood no account; for, in a peremptory tone, she demanded the amount to cover her intended purchases: then she wisely admitted of no delay. Fearing the awful" curtain-lecture," poor fellow! he dared not refuse her; but, making a virtue of neces- sity, he submitted with a very good grace, and handed over the cash as in duty bound. At the parsonage, every one felt dull and gloomy for some time. Mr. Atherton now returned to the duties of his ministry; but was his spiritual ardor pure and bright as usualt Let his remark to his wife answer that question. "I feel sorry to tell you, dear- est, that I do not feel that engagedness in the sacred cause that a servant of the Most High should feel. I think I know the reason. Too   WAIT AND SEE.      145 much pleasant company and unusual earthly enjoyment are not good for me; that is, not in a spiritual point of view. We are apt, like Bunyan's Pilgrim, to forget our' roll,' and leave it in the ' pleasant arbor.' In that case, we must do as Pilgrim did,-- return sorrow- ful, and earnestly seek until we find it." Fanny had lost her buoyant spirits and sun- ny smile, and appeared restless and unhappy. Her thoughts and heart had followed that carriage.- Theodore was moody and' absent- minded, but had the tact to make but few blunders; and those he made were of so trifling a nature as not to deserve censure. He mere- ly, when requested to carve, cut up the vege- tables into small pieces, and left the meat untouched; put sugar on his plate, and salt into his teacup; spread butter on a slice of pork, and mustard on his bread : mere trifles in themselves, had they not proved that " not at home " should label his heart and head. Old Juba's under-lip had sagged, and his eyes drooped at the corners. Said he, "I feerd I not well; feel so flisticated. Massa Ed- X 13  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7378-00000076"/> "6     WAIT AND SEE. 'ard he goin' off too: what we gon to do den 1 I neber tell nobody. Ki!

We now leave Juba to his soliloquy, and Ryefield to its present dulness, while we follow the fortunes of city life.   "7 CHAPTER XXIT. THB CITY MANSION.-THE HAPPY HOME.- CONGENIAL MNDS. - REMNISCENCES. RELIGIOUS EXERCISES. MUSIC, &amp;C. THE return home was very pleasant to the Huntleys, and they were in excellent spirits. The thought of seeing her own beloved native city would have been very cheering to Mrs. Dorset under other circumstances, were there a permanent home to receive her. Yet no one knows how long their own home may be per- manent; but the wanderer could tell you how cheerless it is to be homeless. Late in the afternoon, the carriage drew up before a splendid mansion in Beacon Street, and the hospitable owners gave their pensive guest a most cordial welcome to their home and hearts. Arielle and Freddy were rather absent and dreamy, having left their thoughts in Ryefield.  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7378-00000077"/> "8      WAIT AND SEE. Ascending a flight of steps of the purest marble, the footman gave the silver bell-knob three distinct touches in quick succession; which soon brought Jake, the colored waiter, to the door. The whole household were in perfect ecstasies at the return of the family, and rejoiced to see " dear Miss Arielle and darling Master Freddy," as they expressed it. RMrs. Dorset was installed in a delightful par- lor, dressing-room, and sleeping-room, which were to be appropriated to her exclusive use. These rooms, like the rest of the house, were tastefully furnished with simple elegance and convenience. There was nothing gorgeous or ostentatious, but every thing seemed in per- fect keeping with its noble owners.  There were books, music, and painting apparatus, together with writing utensils. Suffice it to say, that nothing tasteful, beautiful, or con- venient, was lacking. Mrs. Huntley had ar- ranged these rooms by proxy, as her husband had been to the city once or twice previous to their return, after Mrs. Dorset had consented   WAIT AND SEE.      149 to become their guest. All was pleasant and agreeable; but memory, that sweet or pensive or bitter companion, was stirring up the deep fount of feeling in her heart, and she was calling up reminiscences of her life's rosy morning, when, as Alexa Winthrop, the only child, petted dar- ling, and wealthy heiress of her doting parents, she knew no wish ungratified. She could now see that she was completely happy then, before her true, susceptible heart had been submerged beneath Affliction's deepest waves, and become shaded and darkly overcast by painful memo- ries. She was aroused from  this revery by the clasp of a soft hand, which gently pressed her own; and a   warm, tender embrace from her more than sister. "Does the sweet, lone dove find a pleasant perch  ? Does she find rest for the sole of her tiny foot?" whispered the soft, soothing voice of Mrs. Huntley. Mrs. Dorset threw herself on the bosom of her kind friend, and a torrent of unchecked tears relieved her swelling heart. "Forgive 13*  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7378-00000078"/> 150      WAIT AND SEE. these tears," she said: " they are the overflow- ing gratitude and affection of a heart too full to form its feelings into words. Pray, accept the devotion which cannot find words to ex- press itself." A kind assurance that her feelings were un- derstood and appreciated was the response of Mrs. Huntley. She then said, "Perhaps you will not pre- fer the assistance of a servant just now; it might be a restraint on your feelings: so let me assist you to-night, dearest; for you would, under your present feelings, prefer sympathy and sisterly affection to the best tire-woman on earth, I feel confident." "Never, my precious friend, shall you for a moment serve as my dressing-maid. No: I have long been accustomed to dressing and waiting on myself: so, you see, I shall need nothing of the kind, but must reserve your kind ministrations for the' inner temple.'" Mrs. Dorset then commenced putting off her travelling dress: and, despite her remon- strances, her friend would assist her to dress;   WAIT AND SEE.      151 for true, faithful friendship does not stand on strict etiquette. The bell now summoned them to the tea- table. Mrs. Dorset was placed at the right hand of Mrs. Huntley, who said in a low tone, "This must ever be your place, if agreeable to you; from which no visitor, of any age or rank, is to displace you, dearest." Mr. Huntley, with deep reverence, now sup- plicated the Father of mercies for a continua- tion of the blessings they now so richly enjoyed, not for themselves alone, but for the whole human family: at the same time, expressing humble thankfulness for past and present pro- tection from dangers seen and unseen; and for every enjoyment, whether spiritual or tempo- ral. After renewed and affectionate welcomes to Mrs. Dorset from every member of the family, they began to partake of the nice repast be- fore them. After tea, they formed a little group in the front-parlor; and the evening was pleasantly spent in cheerful conversation on common to-  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7378-00000079"/> 152      rAIT AND SEE. pics. The hours passed rapidly, occasionally enlivened by vocal and instrumental music, as they were all proficients in that delightful art. Mr. Huntley's voice was rich, deep, and clear, with great compass; which, united with the rest, made a harmony of very sweet sounds. This lovely, pleasant evening closed,- as all evenings should, by supplicating the guardian- ship of the Most High while overspread by the curtain of night, and lying in that deathke, mysterious state,- sleep. Mrs. Huntley went in person to conduct their friend to her apartments, and to see that all was in pefect preparation. Little Lizzie had gone to sleep in her nice little crib in the nursery, beside the bed of her new nurse. The two ladies had stepped in very softly to look at her. There she- lay in her infantine beauty, smiling in her happy dream, with a large doll hugged tightly in her dimpled, chubby arms; a small bouquet of beautiful flowers in her right hand; and her left hand grasped a large cluster of fine box- raisins. How like a miser had she clinched   WAIT AND SEE.      153 her choice things, with a still tighter grasp as she felt sleep arresting her to take her from them! The ladies gazed on her for a few moments in smiling admiration. Each gave her a gentle kiss and a maternal benediction, and retired to their apartments. The blessings of peace rested on that man- sion: for its inmates had taken the 'c yoke of' Christ," and found it easy; had, put on the "gospel-armor," and found it light. They counted the world's wealth as " dross," compa- ratively speaking, that they might become partakers of the righteousness of a crucified Redeemer, and be gathered with his humble followers in the " starry crown" when the jewels of heaven are reset. They were faith- ful stewards of the wealth intrusted by the great Owner to their care, as we have already seen. There are very few such specimens of fidelity and unselfishness to be found in any grade of life.

Pro- bity and integrity of character weigh lightly in the scales of the great world now, unless wealth, or the appearance of it, is laid beside it. So long as a person can hang out false colors by appearing well dressed, whether able or not, whether by honest means or not (no matter how they obtain the means), so long as they " appear smart," there will be "no ques- tions asked; " but, if they cannot " show off," what do their virtues and merit weigh with the public? Not a feather; not a straw. Many of the human family have made this discovery, without the aid of philosophy; and, finding there was no earthly hope save in wealth, have taken courses to obtain and keep it, which they would blush to see recorded and published before the world, much more before heaven and earth. Let us pause inur course, if we are beginning to set our hearts on riches, and to " make increasing gold our trust." -- "Seek first the kingdom of Heaven and its righteous- ness, and all these things shall be,added."

DISCUSSION OF RIGHT AND WRONG IN THE ]KITCHEN. THERE was a discussion in the kitchen that evening, among the Huntley servants, re- specting the addition of three members to the family circle. Some were rather dissatisfied at the prospect of enjoying less leisure than formerly. The colored cook, being of right the presidentess,. replied, "Lawsakes! jes ef dem bootiful missis and de tudders goin' to be troubersome!" "But Misse Dinah don't seem to 'fleet," said the footman, " dat de boy [meaning Alfred Darley] is to be jest fit to lead Master Fred into all manner of mischievousness." " Och, niver fear!" said Bridget. "I'm thinking that it's not for the likes of ye to be bothering your woolly head about what doesn't belong to you at all, sure, and taking   WAIT AND SEE.      157 the masther's business into your own hands entirely, onyway." "Bad luck to 'em!" said Judy ; -"and couldn't the spalpeens staid where they wor, at home in their own country, sure?" "Let 'em alone, the darlints!" said Biddy; "for the blissed sun niver shined on a more beautifier mither and childer" (as she sup- posed they were). This interesting colloquy was interrupted by the entrance of the housekeeper, who came to give orders to the cook, and to see that all was right in the kitchen: a very good practice, which she seldom omitted. The American chambermaid -had followed the housekeeper down to the kitchen, and waited until she had returned to. her own room. She then, with a toss of contempt, said, "What on earth do you darkies and Irish find to jabber about? I dare persume that not one of you knows what subject you are endeavoring to lucify; and, such being the case, you'd better vanish, you poor, illitcherate creatures, you!

She then, with a gesture which would be equally difficult to imitate or describe, left the room just in time to avoid the wrath-storm which she saw was gathering in all their faces. She and the nursery-maid were allowed to take their meals with the housekeeper in her own room, which had set them one peg above themselves.   159 CHAPTER XXIV. 'APE-ANN HARBOR. - THE OLD FISHERMAN AND WIFE.- THE FOUNDLING. -THE IMPOSTOR.-TREACHERY.-THE PIRATE CHEF. )FF Cape Ann, in the vicinity of Gloucester larbor, lies a flat piece of land, inhabited by ishermen. Their rude huts form a Liliputian ,illage in this rock-bound atom of creation. It was a fine autumn morning, in the nonth of October, when an aged man, bent vith years, might have been seen emerging rom his fishing-boat, bearing what appeared o be a large bundle.   He entered his hut vith it. "i Here, wife; see!"And, uncover- ng it, he presented to her astonished view a )eautiful mulatto child, fast asleep. "Why, you!" said the wife. "Where on irth did you find that air little critter?" "When I went down to the boat, what hould I see but this little heap coiled up in he stern? I could do nothing with it myself,  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7378-00000083"/> WAIT AND SEE. and so I brought the little rogue to you. I guess the poor little wretch has no daddy in particular," said the old man. " Poor thing!" said his wife. "Was there any money, or writing to tell about her ? " " Not's I know on," said the old fisherman. "You go and milk the goat 'ginst she wakes." The child was laid on the bed, and the old woman hastened to obey the order of her husband. As she was hurrying to find the goat, she espied a tall, genteel-looking, middle- aged man approaching her. "Your servant, madam," said the stranger. " How do you do?" " Nicely," said she. "You well and your folks ? Come in and rest ye." "Thank you, madam: I was about to ask the favor.  Rather weary, clambering the cliffs. May I trouble you, madam, for a cup of coffee ? " " Oh, la, yes! oney I hain't got none. My old man forgot it t'other day, when he went to the Harbor. Will some milk answer?  I'm jist going to milk the goat."   WAIT AND SEE.   161   "Yes, my good woman; any thing that is most convenient." As they entered the hut together,'his eyes fell on the sleeping child. "You have a fine little quadroon sleeping there," said he. "La, 'tisn't a quadroont," said she; " 'tis a rale live child. My husband found it in the stern of his boat this morning airly, when he went down to go fishing. The massy knows what we can do with the poor thing." "She is a fine-looking child, apparently about four years old." "All of that, if not older," said she. "If you cannot keep her, I will take care of her until her parents, or whoever claims her, can be found. We have no children: and, if my wife is pleased with her, we might decide to keep her finally; that is, if she is never claimed." "Where do you live? " said the fisher- man. "In Portland, Me. My name is Samuel Long. I have the honor to command the good ship ' Merryweather,' bound to Matan- 14*    &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7378-00000084"/> 162     WAIT AND SEE. zas. We are to run into Portland on our out-bound passage. I shall go up to the house to take leave of my wife," said he musingly. "If you wish me to take the child, I can carry her directly to my own house. Let's see: can you come out to the ship with her? - my time will be so much occupied in fitting off. I have it: you can row. Your wife can bring the. child, and you can take supper and a parting glass of wine with me. You shall partake of the best my ship af- fords. I have the best and oldest wines,- Port, Madeira, and Champagne. You had best come this evening, at eight o'clock; for I cannot be on board earlier to receive you. We must spread our canvas to the first fair breeze after to-morrow morning: so that this evening will be your time." "And you promise to take the child and be good to her if we bring her to your ship to-night " said the old fisher. "I certainly do, my worthy old gentleman. May we expect you " "Why, yes," said the fisherman: "'tis   WAIT AND SEE.     163 the best thing we can do with her, in my 'pinion.- What do you think, wife?" "Me? Well, I 'spect we must let her go." "Well, we shall consider that point settled, then?" "Yes." "Do not mention any part of this trans- action, but be entirely silent. Don't even mention your having found the little colored child; although she seems to have been given to you, by her being placed in your boat. But wrong constructions might be given to the circumstance, which might result in great trouble and perplexity to yourselves. Let her not be seen or heard: that will prevent your being annoyed with idle and impertinent questions. Good-morning!" This harangue was not quite intelligible to the old couple; but they understood enough to know that they must be "still" about the child, and that they were going to have a nice supper on board Capt. Long's ship, and get the foundling off their hands, "as slick as grease," as they expressed it.  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7378-00000085"/> 164     WAIT AND SEE. We will here state that the polite, gentle- manly Capt. Long, of the good ship "Merry- weather," was, in reality, no less than Seymour, commander of the "Flash," a vessel of very questionable character, which had infested the seas at all points for several years, and been, as yet, unconquerable. Archibald Seymour belonged to one of the most honorable and wealthy families in the city of New York. His early manhood gave high promise of goodness and greatness, and a very high station for his maturity: but, alas! his towering Babel was not based on the rock of high, moral principle; and it fell, --fell even to the lowest depths of depravity. (Of how many young men might we record the same lamentable destruction!) True, he had amassed countless hoards of wealth ; but did it yield him pleasure or comfort? did it make him happy for one hour, one moment? Let his conversation with his ship's mate, Jonah Snibbs, recorded in the next chapter, answer that question.   165 CHAPTER XXV. THE PIRATE'S CONFIDENTIAL TALK WITH HS MATE. - DE- TERMNED VENGEANCE. - THE KIDNAPPED CHLD. - THE ACCOMPLICE. - THE MURDER. MAN(EUVRING.

I had every thing to make me happy: wealth, honor, and high position, were within  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7378-00000086"/> 166      WAIT AND SEE. my grasp. I was still ambitious: the splendid future was still bbckoning me onward to the zenith of fame and popularity, to the fulfil- ment of my proudest hopes. It was the day after I completed my twentieth year (an era in my life never to be forgotten), when I saw for the first time the beau ideal of my fondest dreams of loveliness. She had touched a spring and opened a fount of pure, gushing tenderness in my heart, unsealed for the first time on -that eventful day. True, I had in- dulged in fancy and in sensual pursuits. Bah! what have they to do with the heart? I loved as few could love. My heart was at once transferred to my fair charmer. But hear: in my soul's devotion, in the tenderest, fondest point of my existence, I was doomed to be baffled, and crushed to the earth. I sought an opportunity to pour out the fulness of my smitten heart, kneeling at her feet; but was, without a moment's hesitation, politely rejected. No entreaties of mine could prevail. She pleaded a prior claim (d-nation!); and I was refused with great firmness and decision,   WAIT AND SEE.      167 and requested never to speak of the thing again, as she was betrothed to another hand and heart, and the bridals were to be cele- brated very soon. 'I explain all this,' said she, ' that you may see that your rejection is not a slight or a female caprice, but as reason- able as though I were already married to the man of my choice; as I am, in the sight of Heaven.' Rejected! and for whom'? A fellow, a scamp! But never mind. Suffice it to say, that, stung to the quick with slighted love, mortified pride, and blasted hopes,- which aroused every revengeful, bitter feeling in my nature, - in that moment of bitter anguish, I vowed revenge, - fearful revenge. I took a solemn oath on the Bible. At that moment, every good angel deserted me. I then gave myself up to the temptation and power of darkness and spiritual wickedness. To work the misery, and, if possible, the ruin, of my late-worshipped idol and her husband (for she married him), has been my end and aim from that until the present time, and made me alike reckless of danger and of death:  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7378-00000087"/> 168      WAIT AND SEE. While waiting for the favorable time to strike the vengeful blow, days seemed like months, and months like years. To beguile the te- diousness of delayed vengeance and the tardi- ness of lagging time, I rigged out the ' Flash,' and took command. Satan has led me on step by step, until I am completely initiated into our present practice. The rest you know. My present trip to Boston was entirely to carry out this, plan of revenge. Yes, that proud beauty shall kneel in the dust at my feet, and kneel in vain; and that insolent scamp, her paramour, shall writhe in agony, cursing the day he dared to thwart me in my love. My plan of revenge is nearly matured. I shall need your assistance and co-opera- tion, my brave fellow. Will you bear a hand?" "With all my heart, captain. You have only to hint your wishes, if to scale the walls of the Devil's den, and it shall be done on the instant." "Thanks to your valor and integrity, Snibbs: but I'm thinking the gates of that institution   WAIT AND SEE.      169 are always accessible to Us, the officers and crew of the 'Flash,' without any efforts of ours to enter; being not only faithful subjects of the king of that court, but in his majesty's service, and constantly on duty. So, you see, that kind of service will not be required. Ha, ha! "But now we will come direct to the point. I have long had a spy to report any thing of the least importance to me respecting the objects of my determined vengeance. They are very wealthy, and -appear very happy. They had a child,- a son. One of my female agents -and you know their number is not few  got employed in their family by feigning great distress at being out of employment, and destitute of a home or shelter, until she found an opportunity to administer a slow poison to the infant, of which it died. Their physician said it died of congestion of the brain. Ha, ha!  This accomplished, she was missing very soon after. She afterwards reported the birth of a daughter. I thought it best to let this child live long enough to gain all their i5  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7378-00000088"/> 170      WAIT AND SEE. whole hearts' love and devotion, and then find it missing." "A capital idea." "Then you coincide in my plan?" "To a t, Capt. Seymour." "Let me tell you the whole of my scheme, then, Snibbs. When this child was three years of age, I thought it time to put my intended enterprise into operation: so my lady agent of Ann Street has long watched for an opportunity to get possession of this beautiful child; but it was so closely hovered and attended, that there seemed little hopes of success. They never changed their servants: so there was no chance to introduce one of our own into their service. Notwithstanding, we had a little devilish good luck. Yesterday the whole city of Boston was in an uproar on account of a lost child. The whole city was searched; large rewards were offered; but in vain. "On searching old Goody Stringer's house, they found nothing but a mulatto child, asleep; left with her, as the old woman told the police,   WAIT AND SEE.     171 ' while its mother, her boarder, went to carry home some washing she had been doing for the gentry.'" "Capital!" replied Snibbs. "But the yellow child " "Was the lost one, of course." "The Devil! How was it brought aboutt" "Easy enough. The simpletons let a young girl, about a dozen years old, take their petted darling out to ride in her splendid hand- carriage. The servant-girl started for the Common with her charge; but, being rather in doubt which street to take after leaving their residence, she paused, looking inquir- ingly, and then asked a woman to tell her the most direct way to the Common. The woman pointed down a narrow, unfrequented avenue, and said, ' That is the nearest and most direct way to the Common. But I am going a short distance that way: so, if you choose, you can follow.' They had gone about half the length of the avenue, when she stopped, and, looking round with a pleasant smile, said,' Would you like to see some beautiful white squirrels? I  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7378-00000089"/> 172      WAIT AND SEE. thought it would be so pleasing to the little dear in the carriage. If you would like to see them, you can enter this house. I live here, my dear. Go right in. I will just put the little lady's carriage into the yard to pre- vent its being stolen or injured.' The children were perfectly delighted, and quite impatient to see the squirrels. The woman said, 'Rest ye a few moments until they- are brought in. My son has gone to fetch them, and will soon, be back.  Here are some nice grapes and nuts to busy you while waiting.' The children partook of them with a keen relish, but often cast wishful glances toward the door, anxious- ly expecting to see the ' white squirrels.' ' Here,' said the woman, ' is some beautiful, sweet wine : taste of it, my dears.'-' INo, no; milk,' said the child: 'mamma does not div me wine.' The woman then tried the servant- girl. ' You can just taste of it to see how sweet it is.' -  No, ma'am, if you please : my mistress does not allow us to drink wine.' ' What of that? - she will never know it. Come, my dear, take one little sip, it is so nice!'   WAIT AND SEE.      173 And, literally holding the goblet to the girl's lips, she tasted it, exclaiming, ' How good!'- ' Drink it up, dear,' whispered the old crone: 'no one will see you.' And the girl swallowed a large quantity of the wine, after being assured by the old woman that it would not harm her, but, on the contrary, was very healthy, and would give a lovely bloom to her cheeks. The child, seeing her servant smack the wine with such zest, reached out her tiny, dimpled hand, saying, ' Please div me some dood wine, Sally.' The old woman gave her a judicious quantity, but enough to put her into a deep sleep, the wine being drugged. The servant-girl soon  became pale and  dizzy. ' Poor dears,' said the old Jezebel, ' you are so tired! Come, lie on my nice little bed, and rest you.' The squirrels, every thing, were for- gotten. They were both taken down a flight of steps, and, without fear or thought, laid on a rude couch, from which the poor servant was soon removed, a corpse, and concealed in such a manner, that discovery would have been next to impossible had she been searched for. 15*  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7378-00000090"/> 174      WAIT AND SEE. "It was but the work of a few moments to dye the child's hair jet black, to color her skin a mulatto-color from head to foot, and to dis- robe her of her beautiful, rich clothing, and put on a dress more befitting her apparent situation. This was speedily done, without arousing her in the least; and in that state the police found her. It's no wonder they had no suspicions. You will not be at a loss to know whose planning this was." "Excellent! Well planned, by Jove! And what part of this bold enterprise do you allot to your humble servant?" ". i' That is the point I am coming at. You know, the body of the girl is to be disposed of discreetly: you understand. The mulatto child is to be conveyed to-night by old Goody Stringer, colored and dressed to represent the child's mother, to the fisher's village, south- east of Gloucester Harbor, and placed in one of the fisher's boats. She is then to conceal herself, and watch for the coming of the fisher- man, who will take the child, who is to be kept under the influence of the sleeping potion.   WAIT AND SEE.      175 From the boat she is to watch, and inform us which hut he carries it to. You know, we cannot trust our common sailors with this clock-work enterprise; and the business can- not be transacted in daylight. On the high seas I fear no one, - not even the Devil; but, with these land-sharks, it will require all our tact and courage to escape detection." "Good! I wait your orders, sir, like the war-horse champing the bits, with impatience for the charge." "You know, Snibbs," replied the command- er, " that we cannot both be absent all night from the ship: therefore I leave it to your management to dispose of the dead girl. The child's carriage was in ashes in less than an hour after it left home. Look closely after the management of old Goody Stringer: I feel very little confidence in her. Send her down in a butcher-wagon; and, when you have started her off, lock her door, and keep the key: she will never want it again. I will prevail on the fisherman to come to our court- room, taking the child along, which I shall (as  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7378-00000091"/> 176      WAIT AND SEE. a kindness to them, mind) offer to take off their hands, but shall not trouble them to return home again. You will get Mrs. Stringer to come on board with you, as soon as it is dark, to receive the money for her services, you can tell her. Her just reward she will receive; and we must attend to that before the arrival of our other guests. I believe our plan is now fully matured. I trust all to your skilful hands, and will now return to the ship. Suc- cess to you! Good-night!"   1" CHAPTER    XXVI. THE BA-RREL OF BEEF.-- THE SLEEPING POTION.- THE BUTCHER. -THE PROPHETIC WORDS.- THE FEARFUL RETRIBUTION.-THE OLD MAN AND WOMAN.-THE IN- TENDED MURDER.- THE MSTAKE. THAT evening, Snibbs and the old woman had as much business as they could attend to, and were busy as " fresh-water merchants." The body of poor Sally they put into a barrel, and salted pieces of beef over her. The barrel was then headed up, and marked "Beef." This barrel was placed in the butcher's wagon with the seeming mulatto woman and child. The child was aroused long enough to swallow another potion of drugged wine, which kept her in repose until the next evening. They arrived at the place of destination about day- break. Snibbs, who drove the wagon, was dressed and disguised as a butcher, and passed along without attracting attention. On arriv- ing at the settlement of the fisheftnen, all was  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7378-00000092"/> 178      WAIT AND SEE. quiet: not a sound disturbed the silence, save the light rippling of the tide on the beach. They then left the wagon, taking the beef- barrel with them to the nearest boat. It was but the work of a few moments to release the boat from its moorings. They put the barrel in the boat; the woman, with the child in her arms, took a seat in the stern; and Snibbs rowed out to the "Flash," telling the old wo- man that she must remain on board until he returned for her. She replied, "Very well;" having no suspicions. The captain then bade the sailors take the c" beef" on board, and store it. Snibbs then assisted .the " colored woman" to get on board, and the captain called her to the cabin to receive her money before the mate returned to take her back. She per- fectly chuckled with delight when he handed her a purse filled with gold. "You need not stop to count it or to thank me: it's all yours,-- enough to support you for life. And now, my dear Mrs. Stringer, we are to be separated a long time, - perhaps for ever!" maid he with a profound sigh.   WAIT AND SEE.     179 Snibbs will soon be here. Heigh-ho!- Ah! excuse me, madam: I had entirely forgotten to offer you any refreshments. You must be greatly in need. What shall I, order?" "Nothing," said she. "'I cannot take any food: I have no appetite." "Is there nothing you could eat?" "Nothing, thank ye. The gold you gave me will be food, drink, and lodging. Ha, ha, he!" (Truly spoken.) "Ah! speaking of drink, if you have any old port, I will trouble you for about a thimbleful or so." i "Certathly, dear;- with pleasure:. it will do you good." And, stepping to the side-board, he filled a golden cup with the sparkling beverage, which she swallowed with avidity; even drained the cup. "Have your cup replenished, Mrs. Stringer '" "I am afraid it will -play the mischief with me if I take more." "Nothing of the kind, my dear lady. These old wines never intoxicate, unless taken in ex- tremely large quantities." "Well, then, I will take a very little more, thank you."  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7378-00000093"/> 180      WAIT AND SEE. She had no sooner swallowed the last (the reader will understand that it was prepared for her especial use) than she grew sick and faint. Said she, "I've taken too much. I'm tip-tip-sy!"  And she made an effort to rise, but fell back on the sofa to rise no more! Snibbs then approached. They put her into a sack with weights; and, taking a favorable opportunity, the two put her over the ship's side, together with her own victim, - the poor servant, Sally. What a fearful retribution! Snibbs then took the sleeping child, and, wrapping it up warm, placed it itr the boat, and returned, leaving the boat exactly as he had found it. In a concealed position, he waited and watched. At length, an old fisher- man emerged from his hut, and went directly to the boat where the child was.  It was the old man's boat. He gazed a moment in astonishment; and then the kind-hearted old man took the little sleeper up in his arms, and walked briskly towards his own cabin. Snibbs marked the hut with his eye, and then took himself out of the way. He had been absent   WAIT AND SEE.      181 not more than an hour, when the interview between Capt. Seymour and- the old couple (before described) took place. Snibbs rode back to Lynn as a butcher.  There, at a public-house, he took dinner, changed his dress, and sold his horse and wagon; declaring he was heartily tired of trying to live by such hard labor; that he intended to go " right back to Varmount, and work the farm with father." He next took the Gloucester stage, and arrived at the Harbor late in the afternoon. Here he treated himself to whatever he chose; promenaded the streets and the beach: in short, he was seeking what a guilty person can never find, - comfort, pleasure, happi- ness. He could find none of these: He was miserable, though his -coffers were filled with gold. At evening twilight he repaired to the hut of the old fisherman who had taken home the child, and rapped at the door. "Come in,' was the loud response.   He entered. The inmates appeared quite embarrassed at first; 16  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7378-00000094"/> 182     WAIT AND SEE. but his bland, cordial manner soon re-assured them. He then stated that he had been to the Harbor on business; that he belonged to Capt. Long's vessel, the "Merryweather," and wished to go on board directly, not being ready to go when the ship's boat returned; and, handing the old fisherman a gold-piece, requested him to take him to the ship in his boat. "This is too much," said the old man; "for I am going right there to-night." "Never mind; keep it," said Snibbs. "How soon can you go?" "I'm going there at eight o'clock. Didn't the captain tell ye?" "You seem to forget, old daddy, that I have been away from the ship all day." "Ah, yes! that accounts for it. Yes, I ken kerry you. My old woman and the young one is going too." "Capital! 'The more, the merrier,' you know.  Ha, ha! But I am very hungry; and, if I must wait, pray extend to me the hospitalities of your larder,"   WAIT AND SEE.      183 "I don't know what them .is," said the old wife; "but we can give you some victuals, ef that's what you mean." "Exactly." "Well, I'll give you some sea-biscuits: we hain't got nothin' else. We're to eat supper in the ship, the captain said." "Ah! he did? Let us start at once, then; for there is no time to lose," said Snibbs, looking at his watch. They were all safely stowed in the fish-boat; and she skimmed swiftly over the blue waters, propelled by the strong arms of the two men; and gladness nerved the arms of both, but from very different causes. (Oh, what a powerful propeller is gladness of heart!) They were soon greeted with the most cordial reception, and welcomed on board, by the captain. A splendid supper was soon served up, to which the worthy couple did ample justice. Then came the sparkling old wines, clear as amber. They appeared to be very refreshing to the old people. They were so palatable; and they drank so freely, that, had the wines  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7378-00000095"/> 184      WAIT AND SEE. not been drugged, the old simpletons would have been "C most indecently drunk." They soon fell back, and became very pale and weak. They looked around with a bewildered stare for a few moments, and then fell to the floor, - dead, to all appearance. The captain and mate found full employ- ment for nearly an hour in sacking their victims, and dropping them carefully over the side of the ship; for they did not communicate these land secrets to the common sailors. The exercises of the evening being off their hands, the officers of the ship had a merry carousal with wine, brandy, cards, and cigars, while waiting for a good breeze. Late in the evening, the wind being fair, they ran out a few miles to sea, and lay by until daylight.   185 CHAPTER XXVII.

EDWARD  ATHERTON  had accompanied  his nephew Theodore to the University at Cam- bridge; and from thence proceeded to Phila- delphia, where he had some business affairs to attend to. This over, he sauntered about without any definite aim; occasionally calling on acquaintances, but seldom attending parties, although invariably invited by the highest aris- tocracy of that city. Every managing mamma, with marriageable daqihters, felt it her duty to invite the long-absent, wealthy bachelor to her residence, to renew former friendships with themselves, and to contract new ones with their smiling daughters; for, every thing con- sidered, there was not a more desirable match within their knowledge. His return to his native city was very advan- 16*  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7378-00000096"/> 186      WAIT AND SEE. tageous to its dry and fancy goods merchants; inasmuch as their rich, costly dress-stuffs were in great demand, as there was great competi- tion among the reigning belles of that city for the admiration of the handsome, wealthy, noble-minded Edward Atherton. But- "Far other aims his heart had learned to prize;" - for not truer is the magnetic needle to the north than was the heart of Edward to its first attraction. Through hopelessness, time, and absence, those rich, pure affections re- mained unchanged. While Alexa was the wife of another, he managed to put his feelings into a form which he considered a brother's love, the sacredness of which he proved by not subjecting it to a test. He dared not analyze his feelings, lest he should discover something that his high sense of honor and duty might disapprove; but, while he could consider this cherished sentiment a fraternal affection,- 'being the same, more or less," -he could feel no conscientious scruples. Yet we see that time and absence, in his case, proved like   WAIT- AND SEE.     187 the wind, that extinguishes tapers, but kindles fires. But when he returned, after an absence of seven years, and found the object of his brotherly affection a widow and in reversed circumstances, he determined to seek her again in marriage as soon as delicacy-would permit. The intervening time seemed an age to wait. He thought, if he only knew the destiny that she would award liim, be it what it might, he could bear it better than to be suspended between hope and despair. After deep reflection, he decided to express his sentiments by letter, and at once. He commenced, but could find no language to express the deepest feelings of his heart. He could not trace them on paper, but must seek a more eloquent and refined medium. ("The eyes," said he musingly. "I will go directly to Boston, and let my tell-tale eyes insinu- ate what my faltering tongue dare not utter, and would probably make bungling work if it undertook." The next morning found our diffident but  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7378-00000097"/> 188      WAIT AND SEE. matured lover en route for Boston. He had Mr. Huntley's card, and decided to call on him first in his counting-room, and, should he find him disengaged, to seek a private inter- view; hoping to enlist his services, if not his sympathy. He was warmly welcomed by Mr. Huntley, who politely acceded to his request, and listened with great attention and interest while Edward, after placing the seal of con- fidence on the lips of Huntley, communicated to him all, from first to last, respecting the object of his love. "Do you think, my dear Huntley, that I have any ground for hopes?" Huntley, looking half mischievous and half perplexed, seemed for a few moments to be musing. He then looked searchingly into Edward's face with a meaning smile, saying, "Atherton!" "Well." " I'm more than half inclined to become a traitor." "How? Pray explain. I cannot compre- hend."   WAIT AND SEE.      189 "No, no: it's not to be expected of you to understand such incoherent abruptness. I'll be more explicit. Well, then, my dear fellow, you know that an honest lawyer cannot act for or take up but one side in a suit at law; and that must be the side on which he is retained and has received the, retaining fee. But that same honest lawyer has a legal and a moral, nay, even a sacred right to advise the parties to settle and to become united; and, if he is honest, he will do so. Is my learned, figurative eloquence intelligible?" "Why, yes; that is, I don't exactly know if your figure  is encouraging. Give me plain  Einglish, dear Huntley. A  mind on the tenter-hooks of suspense is not clever at translating." "Plain English, eh, my boy? Well, then, will not plain truth do just as well? If so, let me tell you that I think there is not a disen- gaged female heart that would not find you perfectly irresistible." "Nay, but you are only trifling, Huntley, and turning my communication into a jest."  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7378-00000098"/> 190      WAIT AND SEE. "Not a bit of it, my dear Atherton. What I stated is my candid conviction." '"Is that a real fact, Huntley?" "It certainly is, my dear fellow, on my honor. Come, let us go directly to the house. I hope you are not otherwise engaged?" "Thank you. Cannot say that I am." "I am rejoiced that you are not." They then proceeded, arm in arm, to Mr. Huntley's residence. Nothing could be more cordial than the reception of Edward by the family. Mrs. Dorset, though apprised of his presence, did not make her appearance. But this apparent indifference did not discourage him in the least: on the contrary, he viewed it as being favorable to his hopes. "If she felt only friendship," he argued with himself, "she would have welcomed me on my first arrival, like the rest of the family." After much delay and embarrassment, Mrs. Dorset descended to the parlor, and gave Edward a polite but rather diffident and con- strained reception. She endeavored to appear composed and dignified; but her cheek red-   WAIT AND SEE.      191 dened and paled alternately, proving beyond a doubt that he was far from being indifferent to her. Indeed, she could not conceal from herself that the living Edward was fast taking the place of the dear departed William in her heart. True, she 'mourned for him, and deeply, but as for a very dear brother. The conversation was rather constrained; for no one seemed to know exactly what to say. Edward praised the improvement of little Lizzie, who was now legally adopted into the family and name of Huntley as their own. He also recognized Alfred, who was now  a handsome, intelligent-looking boy, with a look of perfect contentment and happiness. After an hour's general conversation and a little vocal music, Edward rose to depart; but he was compelled to engage to return to din- ner, and to give them  " the pleasure of his company for the evening." He  pretended to stammer something about " begging to be ex- cused," but felt secretly rejoiced when Huntley said, "Cannot do it, sir. Any thing in reason; but not that."  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7378-00000099"/> 192      WAIT AND SEE. The whole family circle, with one exception, echoed the same sentiment. Mrs. Dorset was silent; but her expressive eye said, "Come." -"Indeed, my dear boy," said Huntley, " we Are going to be more exacting still, and to in- sist on your making a home with us during your stay in the city, if agreeable to you." Huntley said this with such a ludicrous at- tempt at gravity, that it was perfectly irresisti- ble. Every one present burst into a merry laugh at his expense. : Do you, dearest, express our joint request," said Huntley to his wife. "No one could re- fuse you. He must be more than human if he did not find your wishes irresistible." "4 You intend that fine speech for flattery," said Mrs. Huntley, laughing; " but I shall consider it only words of encouragement, and proceed accordingly."  Then, gracefully ex- tending her hand to Edward, she said, "Will you not promise to indulge us by consenting to make your home with us while you remain in our city?"

VISIT TO THE PICTURE GALLERY.--THE LUDICROUS MS- TAKE. -THE LEARNED BLACKSMTH- E MYSTERIOUS PICTURE OF A QUADROON. - STORY OF THE PIRATE SHP. - STORY OF HENRY SINCLAIR.-- THE CAPTURE. THE two gentlemen now took their leave. As soon as they had gained the street, said Hunt- ley, "The charm works. I congratulate you, Atherton, at a venture." "Thank you," said Edward mechanically; for he seemed in a deep revery, and quite un- conscious of his words. Again he musingly said, "Thank you;" and then, with a glowing smile, said, "Ah, yes! with double-distilled essential thanks." "Where shall we go ."   said Huntley. "Would you like to see our Athenaeum?." ' Very much. We will go there, if you please." "Well, it will give me pleasure to attend you: and, poor fellow! you will, no doubt,   WAIT AND SEE.      195 find my presence necessary; for, in your pre- sent eclipsed state of mind, you probably would not know the picture of Patrick Lyon, the in- genious blacksmith, from that of the Madonna and Child, unless my sagacity and acuteness should condescend to explain it to you," said Huntley with mock gravity. "True," said Edward in the same vein. "And may I trouble you still farther to see that I do not hold my catalogue wrong side up, and thereby expose myself to the public?" "Well thought of," said Huntley. "I am rejoiced, my dear fellow, to find, that (pardon me), under all your aberrations of mind, you still retain a vivid sense of propriety." They had now reached the entrance to the gallery. Edward, pointing to the picture of King Lear, asked his friend, in Spanish, if that was not a likeness of the " learned blacksnmith;" inadvertently substituting the word " learned " for s" ingenious." Blandon chanced to be standing at his elbow, and answered in the same language,  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7378-00000101"/> 196      WAIT AND SEE. "You do me too much honor, sir. Is the re- semblance striking?" Edward, much embarrassed, was endeavor- ing to apologize; when his friend, who was slightly acquainted with Blandon, came to his relief, and introduced them, explaining Ed- ward's mistake, which was accepted in a very gentlemanly manner by Blandon's declaring that he felt flattered, and considered it a high compliment. The three then walked several times around the spacious gallery, commenting on the works of the different artists as they passed them; until they paused before a splen- did picture. "This," said Mr. Blandon, " is, to me, one of the most attractive paintings here. It represents the beautiful little mulatto child found in that pirate's ship, the ' Flash;' which, you will recollect, was brought into Boston Harbor a few years ago. It was all new to his auditors. If they ever knew it, it had long been forgotten. Mr. Blandon, perceiving that they manifest- ed a deep interest in the picture and its history, proceeded: "The officers and crew, with one   NWAIT AND SEE.      197 exception, were hung at the yard-arm of their own ship. Seymour, their leader, had been a notorious wretch, but died apparently a sincere penitent. Henry Sinclair, a very young man, clearly proved his innocence by the officers and crew, who unanimously testified that he was a prisoner, whom the captain had put into service as cabin-waiter, finding him firmly re- solved to die, rather than peril his soul, and blast the honorable name he bore, by a parti- cipation in the crimes he was forced to witness. This beautiful yellow child, then about four years of age, was found in the ship; but no one could tell to whom she belonged. The child was so overcome with terror, that nothing could be learned from her: indeed, she seemed to retain no recollection' of the past. This likeness was taken, and advertisements in- serted in all the papers; but no one appeared to claim her, and she was-sent to be educated at an institution suited to her age." "Thank you," said both gentlemen simulta- neously, appearing quite interested. "It would be very gratifying to    know  * 17*  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7378-00000102"/> 198      WAIT AND SEE,. more of the history of the beautiful little original of this splendid picture," said Mr. Huntley. "If the captain of the pirates died peni- tent, I should think he would have given some information respecting the child," said Edward. "He did," replied Mr. Blandon; " but that communication was written and sealed. It was directed to an old gentleman in the city of Boston; I do not recollect the name: but the old gentleman was dead, and his family gone no one knew where; and there the matter rested. The pirate chief said that she would be claimed immediately after that packet was received. This was a few hours before the execution." Mr. Huntley, looking at his watch, said, "Shall we return? It is near the dinner-hour. Mr. Blandon, shall we have the pleasure of your company? It will be very gratifying if you would take pa plain family dinner with us." But Mr. Blandon begged to be excused,   WAIT AND SEE.     199 being already engaged to take dinner with a bachelor friend (who probably dined on litera- ture); and the three gentlemen passed out together.  .  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7378-00000103"/> 200 CHAPTER XXIX. EDWARD AND ALEXA. -THE PICTURE -PURCHASE.- THE GIFT. AT dinner, Edward spoke of the paintings; and Mr. Huntley was so much interested with what he had seen and heard at the Athe- naeum, that he insisted on all the ladies return- ing with them after dinner.  Mrs. Dorset hesitated; but, being overpowered by num- bers, yielded. On entering the gallery, her gaze was riveted on one picture ; indeed, she appeared perfectly fascinated with the little quadroon portrait: it seemed to recall deep, long-cherished memories. Edward, who was not an inattentive observer, ventured to ask if the picture pleased her. "Very much," was her laconic, absent- minded reply. Edward referred to his catalogue, and soon found that the picture was marked "for sale."   WAIT AND SEE,      201 He then darted off to find the committee ; and soon received a receipted bill of the picture, in Mrs. Dorset's name, after filling a check in his own for a thousand dollars. It was the work of but a few moments to send and get this cashed. He then returned to his compa- nions, his handsome face radiant with delight; and, apologizing for his temporary absence, gracefully presented the bill to Mrs. Dorset, soliciting her acceptance. She felt much surprised and embarrassed. She could not reject his present without wound- ing his feelings and appearing ungrateful; and to receive such a costly gift from a gentleman' in no way connected would appear impru- dent, to say the least, she thought. Edward was intently watching her trembling thoughts, as they rose and printed themselves on her ex- pressive features. At length, said she, "Mr. Atherton, you are too kind. I have no words that will sufficiently express my gratitude; but dowering her voice) will it not be thought-- a-that is, too costly a present for me to re- ceive, even from -a --friend?"  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7378-00000104"/> 202      WAIT AND SEE. ("Is it -not from more than a friend, dear Alexa ." whispered he. "Allow me to have it sent home for you, unless you are determined to wholly destroy me!" After a short pause and a crimson blush, she said, in a low, trembling, sweet voice, "Send it up." Edward was in a perfect ecstasy; for he felt renewed hopes of success, knowing that she never stooped to coquetry, even in early youth,--much less now, when a widow and of mature age. After tea, the picture was brought to Mrs. Huntley's, and Mrs. Dorset was consulted as to where she would like to have it placed. "Do, my dear Mrs. Huntley, decide that; as I can scarcely yet realize that it is mine." As she said this, Edward watched her face, as if his life hung on its expression and her words. "Well, then, if I am to decide," said Mrs. Huntley, " suppose we let it remain in our parlor until we make up our minds where to place it. Will that arrangement please you, dear Alexa?"   WAIT AND SEE.      203 "Very much: exactly what I should pre- fer." The evening passed off most agreeably to every one of that happy group, and to all the inmates of that hospitable mansion; and the balmy, moonlit atmosphere heightened, if pos- sible, the beauty and enjoyment, of the scene.  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7378-00000105"/> 204 CHAPTER XXX. THE PIRATE SHP AT SEA.--ESCAPE OF THE OLD FISHER- MAN AND WIFE. - SUCCESSFUL HEROISM OF SINCLAIR.-- THE CAROUSAL.--LONG CONSULTATION.--PLAN OF VEN- GEANCE. -THE INTENDED VICTIMS.--THE SURPRISE.- THE ATTACK. - THE SURRENDER OF THE PIRATES.-- THE CONFESSION. IN a preceding chapter, we left the pirate ves- sel at sea, a few miles from Cape-Ann Harbor. It will be recollected that the old fisherman and wife were invited on board by the captain, on the evening of his departure ; with what intentions on his part, the reader is already aware. Henry Sinclair, a captive, who was cabin- waiter (as before stated), had determined to escape from. that horrid place, and had long been waiting for a favorable opportunity to make the attempt. When he saw the old couple arrive in their boat, he felt quite sure that they were intended victims.  He had watched the manoeuvres of the officers, from   WAIT AND SEE.      205 a sly corner of his eye, for a day or two. On that day he had observed them very closely, without appearing to do so. In the afternoon, the captain had ordered him to bring out se- veral bottles of different wines, that he might uncork and test them; as he expected visitors in the evening, he said. While he was un- corking the wine, Henry appeared to be busy on the other side of the cabin, wiping the fur- niture, which caused him to stoop frequently. He then could peep slyly between his arm and side, and, unsuspected, watch the movements of the captain. He saw him take a paper from his breast pocket, and- open it. It con- tained a fine powder. A portion of this he infused into each of the bottles containing port, claret, madeira, and champagne. He then corked l:them up, and called Henry, say- ing, "They will do. Put them into the side- board until they are ordered." Saying this, he left the cabin. As soon as the captain had left, the young man marked the prepared bottles with a slight indentation on each cork; which impression 18  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7378-00000106"/> 206      WAIT AND SEE. no one but himself would be likely to notice. He then put them very carefully into the side- board, intending to act conscientiously when the trying moment arrived. He then brought out four more bottles of the same kinds of wine, drew the corks, and then replaced them to resemble those the captain had prepared. Placing them in the same compartment of the side-board, he covered them with loose papers and litter until they were completely secreted. Henry was always intrusted with the keys to the wine, as the officers were aware that he could not be induced to taste it or any other intoxicating drinks: a worthy example, though found in a pirate ship; which it is hoped every young man will follow. The evening before, when Mrs. Stringer came on board, Henry had an order which would keep him some time on deck, and which rendered it impossible for him to save her; not daring to warn her by any sign, for fear of her treachery: for he suspected her as an accomplice, - an agent between Satan and the commander of that vessel.   WAIT AND SEE.      207 After the conversation (before referred to) between old Mrs. Stringer and Capt. Seymour, and when she consented to take a little port wine, the captain, who gallantly served her with his own hands, examined the bottle very closely to make himself quite sure that he had got the right one. It produced the effect already described. When all the confidential business was despatched by the captain and his worthy mate Snibbs, a summons was forwarded to Henry to make himself ready to serve at supper. Thus every thing passed on in the usual way until the next evening, at eight o'clock; when  he saw Snibbs return in a fishing-boat, accompanied by an old man and woman; also a large package, which had the appearance of a child, coiled and wrapped up. He felt quite sure that they were to be victims of horrid murder; and determined, by divine assistance, to rescue them. He secretly ex- amined  the fastening of their boat, and refastened it in a  way to hold, but easy to unloose; and then sauntered about on deck,  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7378-00000107"/> 208     WAIT AND SEE. waiting an order from the captain to come below: for, as in the case of an old Bible king, it was sometimes death to enter his presence unbidden. It was not long, however, before he was summoned below to serve at table; and, when he was ordered to bring out the wine, the guests were being seated at the sumptuous board, where Capt. Seymour presided with a bland, gentlemanly dignity befitting a king. "Now!" thought Henry. Which kind, sir " "The four kinds proved this morning,' was the answer. Henry, with a trembling hand, reached into the side-board, and took the bottles he had secreted under the litter, and placed them before the captain, while the latter was con- sulting his guests as to which kind they would take first. Sinclair adroitly concealed the prepared bottles of wine under the rubbish until he could get an opportunity to place them in a more secure hiding-place. He soon perceived that the old couple were making very free with the wine. With a deep   WAIT AND SEE.      209 sigh, said he mentally, "Why will ye die " This sentence had a literal as well as a figura- tive import; for he well knew, that, if they became intoxicated, there was no hope of saving them. As before stated, they became dead drunk; were sacked, and put over- board. Henry had been ordered into the captain's stateroom to copy a deed, that he might not be present to witness the deed they were going to execute. No sooner had the sack containing the old couple been carefully lowered into the sea than the pirates left it with perfect indifference and unconcern, well knowing that it would not appear on the surface: they had taken care of that. They then went to their carousal (as before stated). The cold sea-water quickened the prisoners of the sack; and they were at once restored not only to life, but were com- pletely sobered, and in possession of their usual faculties. The shrewd old man soon fumbled out his large jack-knife, which was very sharp, and with it rent the sack from end to end, and 18*  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7378-00000108"/> 210      WAIT AND SEE. threw it off. This sent them directly to the surface.  "Don't make any noise, - not for your life!"whispered the old man to his wife as they came up together. "Let us swim for the boat," said he. "There, be careful: you like to pulled me under the water! Don't touch me! Let me get a grip on the waist of your gownd: there." And he soon found his own boat, and assisted her to get in, and then got in himself; letting the boat drift until the distance from the ship would render it safe to use the oars. But, at that time, there was not much danger of discovery, as it was in the height of the carousal, of which the crew, with one exception, were partakers. This over, a few of the crew, who were more abstemious than the rest, were not too drunk to work the ship; and they ran a few miles out, and dropped anchor until morning (as before said). Feeling in no mood of sleep, and ordering Henry to quit his copying of the deed and to turn in, our two worthies, Seymour and Snibbs, had a long consultation   WAIT AND SEE.      2" respecting the child. At that moment she cried, "Mamma! papa! Sally!" ' "D--n the squalling brat!" said Seymour. "I'm half inclinmed to choke the little trouble- some devil." "Which would end your power over its parents," quietly remarked the mate. "True, Snibbs: you are right.' We will bear with the brat for the sake of having full and complete revenge.  Will you oblige me by giving her a piece of cake from the locker, and a little drink?" "Certainly, sir," said Snibbs. "There will be no  occasion for narcotic potions here, I suppose?" "None, Snibbs; that is, if she is not too troublesome. -  But to return to our sub- ject. I have made out my   plan for the fu- ture." "Indeed, sir! Well?"

"If you had left out the second letter of that last word, you would have hit the mark to a t." After a moment's thought, Seymour roared with laughter, slapping Snibbs familiarly on the shoulder. "Good! you budget of perfect wit and humor." Saying this, Seymour helped himself to more brandy, and pushed the bottle towards his mate. "Thank you, captain; but recollect, 'sir, that my head will not bear as much as yours." "True, Snibbs: I had forgotten that," re- plied Seymour, and then renewed their former subject. His last swig of brandy had put him into a very communicative mood, and he went on revealing his entire plan to the attentive ears of his accomplice and confederate. ("You know, Snibbs, we were speaking df this troublesome child now on our hands. I   WAIT AND SEE.     213 intend now to make quick work, and delay my vengeance no longer.

I always thought that genuine love was all tenderness towards its object.

"Under such circumstances, I excuse you; but be careful not to get intoxicated: it makes a perfect simpleton of any one, and you most of all." In this way, the night had passed with them very quickly; all the crew being asleep, -even the watch on deck. Still these two   WAIT AND SEE.      215 remained wakeful, and engaged in confidential discourse. Towards the break of day, the cap- tain said, "Had we not better turn in, Snibbs?

Shall we go up, captain?" "Arm, arm!   'Tis grappling-hooks: I can- not be mistaken!" cried the captain. The officers then attempted to rush on deck; but a stern voice at the landing cried, '"Halt, and surrender!  Resistance will be entirely useless. Your drunken crew are already in irons. We arrest you in the name and by the authority of the United States." The pirates, seeing that they were com- pletely surrounded and their crew taken care of, surrendered without any attempt at resistance, well knowing that they would be cut down at once if they did not yield; and life is sweet to those who expect and deserve death.  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7378-00000111"/> 216      WAIT AND SEE. They were secured in irons, and taken to Cape Ann; from thence to Boston, to await their trial, the result of which is already known.  Henry Sinclair was pardoned (as before stated). The prisoners had the benefit of counsel, legal and clerical. Some among them were penitent, among whom were the officers of the gang; but their confessions were not necessary to justice. The oath of the old fisherman and wife, who were well known to the inhabitants of Cape Ann as honest, truthful persons, hung the pi- rates. Seymour and his accomplice felt no hopes of escape or pardon.  They owned that it was a just retribution. Seymour, who gave evidence of being a humble and sincere peni- tent, entreated those around them to pray for them, - to pray for that mercy for them which they had denied to others. " O God!" cried he, "cut us not off in our sins. Oh! give us true repentance; and, oh! forgive."

Being nearly exhausted with fatigue, and chilled almost to death, they proceeded to the nearest house, dripping with wet and benumbed with cold. "For the love of Heaven, get up, and let us in!" cried the old man, knocking loudly at the door. !"Who's there at this time o' night 1 " bawled a harsh voice from within. "Let us in, and you shall know. NWe are perishing!" cried the poor old man. "Wait a moment; I'm coming," replied the same voice ill a milder tone. Another minute, and the door was opened, and a kind   WAIT AND SEE.      219 face met them. "What is the matter? what has happened? Come right in. I'll have a fire and some dry garments. - Wife! here, get up, and take care of this poor old lady: do you hear?  Come, wake up: they are nearly exhausted with wet -and cold, and per- haps hunger. Will you get up-?" "What is it all about?" said the sleepy wife, rubbing her eyes and looking bewildered. "Get up and see," said her husband impa- tiently; and he ran to kindle a fire "I-ere," said he, throwing to them a number of blan- kets, c" make yourselves as comfortable as possible with these till the fire burns. "We'll soon have something warm for you." The comfortable wife now came sauntering out of her sleeping-room, yawning and saying, "Oh, dear! what is the matter?" Her hus- band pointed to the poor old people, saying, "Look there!"She looked, and the sight brought her to her senses instantly. "Poor creatures!" said she. "Come, my good old lady, - come right into my bedroom, and let me take off your wet clothes."  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7378-00000113"/> 220      WAIT AND SEE. They were soon got off, and the poor old shivering frame wrapped in warm blankets, and put to bed. While this was being done, her husband had got the old man into dry clothing, and wrapped up in blankets before a brisk fire. As soon as the kettle boiled, the good wife made a nice cup of coffee, of which both suf- ferers partook freely. It renovated them at once. After becoming comfortably warm, an impromptu supper was placed before them. Before tasting it, the old fisher desired the man not to mind them longer, but to raise the alarm as quick as possible, and pursue the -pirates, from whom they had but just escaped. The whole place was quickly in commotion, and a sufficient number of sturdy, courageous seamen volunteered to go in pursuit; tak- ing instructions from the old fisherman, who was personally known to nearly all of them. They took the swiftest sailing vessel to be ob- tained in the Harbor; intending to take them by stratagem and by surprise if possible, ac- cording to the old fisher's advice. //   WAIT AND SEE.      221 Several other vessels followed the first, in order to render assistance if necessary. The result is known. The colored child was taken from the pirate ship, and carried to the nearest hotel in the Harbor; where the old couple were invited to go the next day, as it would better accommodate their numerous callers. A heavy purse was soon made up, and present- ed to the old man, - a fortune- for him; and he was to remain at the hotel with his wife until after the trial. The poor oldi couple dared not return to their former residence, and were very thankful to have a temporary place of residence so generously provided for them. They could give no information respecting the child, more than finding her in their boat, and being enticed to carry her to the ship (as before stated). The yellow child soon became an object of deep interest, and was much caressed; but her memory and vivacity seemed  completely be- aumbed. She did not even recollect her own name or those of her parents, but talked often thout the "( white squirrels." 19*  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7378-00000114"/> 222      WAIT AND SEE. Seymour, in his confession, named all his crimes of piracy and murder, but withheld the names of his victims; and neither he nor his mate (the only persons living who knew) would say any thing in regard to the child found with them, but promised to send a package, giving an authentic sketch of all they knew respect- ing her, to those who would instantly claim her as soon as the package was received. Sey- mour said, that, when the packet was read, his reasons for withholding the names would be obvious. He sent all the money in his posses- sion- that is, about his person; being about a thousand dollars - to support the child until she was claimed. On the day of the trial, when the chief wit- nesses -the old couple - entered the witness- box, Seymour and Snibbs both turned pale as death, and trembled so violently in every limb, that they could not stand, and were prevented by strong arms from falling to the floor. The evidence was so direct and conclusive, that the trial occupied much less time than usual on such occasions. The prisoners were allowed (   WAIT AND SEE.      223 the most learned, able, and ingenious counsel; but it did not avail: indeed, those lawyers had each a conscience (we would like to say as much of all their profession), and said but enough to fulfil the oath taken when admitted to the civil bar. The jury, after an absence of about twenty minutes, returned a verdict of "Guilty in the first degree." It was dreadful to see the judge put on that terrible black cap, and to hear him sentence seventeen poor, ruined wretches to be preci- pitated into a dark and fearful eternity! They had now but one week to prepare for death. Some   were penitent, some entirely stupid, and others were in great mental dis- tress. Of the latter was Capt. Seymour, who declared that his sentence was just; that he deserved to have all the suffering, all the pun- ishment; that, if he had a hundred lives, he had forfeited them  all. "But, oh!" said he, "I am not fit to die." He asked for writing materials, that he might, he said, discharge an important duty to- wards those whom he had most deeply injured.  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7378-00000115"/> 224      WAIT AND SEE. "O my God!" said he, " is it possible? canst thou forgive such deep-dyed crimes?" He then wrote a long, solemn letter to Alexa, confessing all his sins and cruelty to her, who had ever been a " pattern of purity and fidelity;" beseeching her, in the name of Heaven, to pity, forgive, and pray for him. He explained every thing respecting her lost child, and confessed his plans for the future respecting herself, her husband and child. "But," said he, " behold the avenging hald of God has arrested me to cut me off for ever, and in my sins. O Alexa! you must be more than human to forgive so vile a monster. I dare not hope for it. I cannot expect you to have more mercy than Heaven. The retribu- tion of sin is a bitter draught; but I must drain that dreadful cup. My repentance has come too late.          i "Enclosed in this packet you will find all that is now in my power to bestow, not as amends,--for that can never be, --but as a token that I died with the desire of it in my heart.

The reader will recollect that this was the name and address of Alexa's father. Capt. Seymour sent to Henry"Sinclair, re- questing him to come to his cell, as he had something to intrust to his special care. Henry made no objections to enter his cell, provided the keeper would accompany him as a witness to their interview. To this condition, Sey- mour .made no objections; and Henry and the jailor entered the cell. "Henry Sinclair," said the captain, "I have sought this interview with you, first of all, to entreat your forgiveness with my own lips- be- fore I die." "May Heaven forgive my sins as entirely as I do yours, Capt. Seymour!" replied Henry. "Bless you!  May Heaven bless you!

"Oh! never mention that; a solitary act of simple justice." "And yet it saved me," said Henry. "What can I do for you, captain?" "This package is a very important one. Having the most perfect confidence in your honor and integrity, I desire- to place' it in your hands, to be delivered to its address the day after the- the execution! -- not before,- and by your own hand; delivered, not intrusted to any other.

SINCLAIR'S HISTORY. - THE SEA-FIGHT. - EFFICACY OF PRAYER; &amp;C. HENRY SINCLAIR was a native of Liverpool, ng.; where he left a happy home, kind trents, and three lovely sisters. Being an lly son, and his parents wealthy, he could dulge in whatever pleased him, provided ways that it met the approbation  of his mily and friends. Having a desire to visit nerica, his parents cheerfully consented to 3 taking passage in a vessel of their own, und to New York, and commanded by one whom they felt the utmost confidence, not ly as a commander of their vessel, but as a nporary guardian of their son; who was 'n about eighteen years of age. Henry was delighted with the anticipation his voyage and travels. He was fitted ; with the kindest care. Nothing that a 20  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7378-00000118"/> 2 30     WAIT AND SEE. mother's tenderest thoughts could suggest was wanting to render his situation pleasant and to make him happy. They sailed on the first day of September; and, having a fine breeze from the right point, soon left the white cliffs of England far behind them in the distance. The weather being pleasant, and the wind fair, they ran on at the rate of nine knots an hour for about ten days. Nothing could ex- ceed the exuberance of spirits and enjoyment manifested by young Sinclair. They had skimmed the blue waves, without a storm, or even a heavy gale, until within a few days' sail of their destined port. One day, when all was pleasant enjoyment, a hand, who had been on duty aloft, hastened down, and re- quested the captain'to look through his glass at something in the distance. The captain caught up his glass, and soon espied a suspi- cious-looking craft, apparently in pursuit of them. She came bearing down upon them with such a defiant air, that the captain, with a troubled look, shook his head, saying he did. not like her appearance, and that, if he made J   WAIT AND SEE.      231 her out right, she was that infernal pirate ship, the "Flash." "We must run for't, my boys! Resistance against such unequal force would be entirely unavailing, and rashy throwing away our ives. But there is not a moment to lose. We must not stop to manoeuvre. Spring, my learties; crowd every stitch of canvas! She s fast gaining on us. Our only chance now is o outrun her." The captain gave his orders rapidly to his ,ble seamen, saying, , You are working for ife, my brave fellows!" Young   Sinclair was, at this time, in his tateroom, kneeling in prayer. The suspicious essel - which was, indeed, the "Flash " - ras now within hailing distance. "Heave to, and drop alongside!" bawled ie pirate chief through his trumpet; but the nglish brig was straining to escape, and ap- arently took no heed. "Heave your brig to, or I'll do it for ye, ast your eyes!" again roared the pirate; but e  brig was still running for life. Vain was  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7378-00000119"/> 232     WAIT AND SEE. their flight. The report of the pirate's guns now came heavily booming over the water, and the work of death and destruction began. The English seamen were shot down at every fire of the enemy; and the brig, now dismasted and crippled, soon became an easy prey. They were instantly boarded by the pirates, and the work of rifling and carnage ensued. Every one that remained was unmercifully butchered, except young Sinclair, who still remained in prayer. "You may save that praying fellow," shout- ed the captain of the pirates. "We want a parson in our ship, and his delicate hands will be just the thing to administer the cake and wine at our table. Ha, ha, ha! And, as I am in want of a secretary, we will try him for a few days. Bring him along, nolens volens. Take every article of value from that dowdy old brig as soon as possible, and then scuttle her. "Ay, ay, sir," replied the pirate crew. The reader knows the rest. How the situation of poor Henry Sinclair   WAIT AND SEE.     233 was changed in one short hour! To be put in irons and in prison as a felon, on his first arrival at an American port, - what a reverse to his joyful anticipations! So true it is, that no mortal can tell in the morning what the day will bring forth. No one seemed willing to receive the money sent by Seymour for the child. It was finally decided to let the old fisherman take the money and the child; that, when she was claimed, the remainder of the thousand dollars was to be his, as a small remuneration for the perils, hardships, and fright he had suffered at the hands of the pirates. The old man took it without any conscientious scruples, as he came honestly by it, and knew of no one who had a better right to it than themselves, as they were to support the child, who had, at that time, every appearance of being a beauti- ful idiot. With the money he bought a snug place in a retired nook on the Cape, where they lived until the end of their days. Neither of them would ever put the wine-cup again to 20*  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7378-00000120"/> 234      WAIT AND SEE. their lips: indeed, the sight of wine or other spirituous drinks would cause them to shud- der and turn pale; it brought up fearful memories. They took the poor colored idiot to their new home, and treated her with great care and tenderness. We now leave her in their faithful hands. When the novelty of her situation had passed off, she was gradually forgotten by the public.   235 CHAPTER   XXXTTI. THE MYSTERIOUS PACKET.- HENRY'S RETURN TO ENGLAND. IT will be remembered that the package delivered to the keeping of Henry Sinclair by Seymour, a few days previous to his execution, was not to be delivered until after that fearful day. Henry had solemnly promised this; and he was therefore obliged to retain it until the time specified. On the day of his farewell with Seymour, he left the prison with the package in his hand; and being much absorbed in the solemn scene in which he had just participated, and scarcely knowing where he went until the residence to which the parcel was directed was directly before him, he was about to ascend the flight of steps, and ring; when he suddenly recol- lected that it was not to be delivered then, and proceeded directly to his hotel, and placed  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7378-00000121"/> 236      WAIT AND SEE. the paper in a secret drawer of his trunk to insure its safety. Dinner being announced, he took his seat at the table; but, feeling disinclined to eat, he was about to leave the table, when a waiter entered the dining-saloon, and asked for Mr. Henry Sinclair. "The gentleman bade me say that his business was urgent, and admitted of no delay, or he would not have trespassed on your dinner-hour," said the waiter, presenting the gentleman's card. "Show me to him instantly!" said Sinclair, glancing at the name of "Frank Howard, Liverpool, Eng." Nearly overcome by his emotions, he rushed into the extended arms of his friend. "How- ard!" -"Sinclair!" was all that either could express for some time. After becoming more composed, mutual inquiries ensued. "I have much to ask, and much to say, my dear fellow," said Howard; "but must tell you the rest on board. There is not time here. I have come to find you, and have but just. succeeded. The vessel is now about getting under way, as the wind is fair. They will   WAIT AND SEE.     237 probably weigh anchor in about an hour. Let me discharge your bill while you see to having your baggage made. ready and taken to the vessel. Not a moment to lose, my dear fel- low!" Henry, half crazed, was hurried on board by his active friend. His baggage was soon carefully stowed in their stateroom; and the "Aurora," of Liverpool, under easy sail before a pleasant breeze. The two friends remained on deck to view the city of Boston as it receded in the distance, until it appeared as a mere speck on the hori- zon. They then went below, and Henry was introduced to the captain, who welcomed him  with a cordial shake of the hand, inviting him to make himself quite at home while in the "Aurora." Henry then related to his astonished friend the eventful life he had lived since leaving home. Frank informed Henry the cause of his seeking him in such haste; that, after hear- ing of the probable loss of the brig in which he had sailed, his father had mourned the  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7378-00000122"/> 238      WAIT AND SEE. supposed loss of his only son, until he was laid on a sick-bed, and was apparently sink- ing; and that he (Howard) had taken passage to New York, - the destination of the brig. He there learned that the brig had been captured and sunk by pirates, and that the pirates were soon after captured, and taken to Boston. He had gone immediately there; and found, on inquiry, that Henry was alive. The next thing was to find him. "Being informed of your whereabouts, I went immediately to the wharf, where this vessel was just getting under sail to return to Liverpool. I hastened on board, saw the cap- - tain, and secured our berths; that is, if we were on board in two hours. Having obtained his promise to wait until four o'clock, P M., I came, post-haste, pellmell, to find and get you on board within that time; and if any human aid can restore your father, and sustain your mother and sisters, it will be the seeing you, Henry." "Ten times ten thousand thanks, my noble friend! Your persevering friendship, and   WAIT AND SEE.      239 prompt efficient aid, have laid me under an obligation that never can be repaid; nor can it ever be forgotten. Accept the gratitude that fills my heart, but which cannot form it- self into words, my best of friends!" "No more on that subject, if you please, my dear boy." "I have been seeking an opportunity to embark, and return home," said Henry; ", not wishing to remain longer in America. I have already seen too much." "I should suppose so," said -Howard. Henry continued: "I was but waiting to deliver"   Here he paused, and sprang from his seat, looking very pale and anx- ious. "What is it, Henry? Are you ill?"  "No: worse than that." "Pray explain, my dear fellow. Will you not communicate to one you style ' friend,' the cause of your present agitation?" "The package!" cried Sinclair. What shall I do? I promised Seymour, the pirate chief, and called on Heaven to witness the vow, that  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7378-00000123"/> 240      WAIT AND SEE. I would deliver, on the day after his execution, and not before, the package which he placed in my hand.  That packet lies now in the secret drawer of my trunk! I was so much agitated, when we left Boston, that I forgot it. What a betrayal of confidence! What a breach of trust! to say nothing of the sin of breaking a solemn promise!" "Don't feel so distressed, my dear friend. You have only to send it by the first opportu- nity," said Frank. "That will not do: I wish it would. I pro- mised to deliver it with my own hands, and not trust it to another." "You will, then, have to keep it until you can return with it yourself. I can see no other way." "But he said it was of the utmost impor- tance," replied Henry. "It cannot be helped now, my dear fel- low; and you had better dismiss it from your thoughts at present, as it will only pain you, and to no purpose. The time to deliver it had not arrived. You could not protract your stay   WAIT AND SEE.      241 in Boston for a day, - no, not for an hour, - under the circumstances in which you were placed, when your sick father lies languishing to see his only son. You have no just cause to reproach yourself: no blame can be attri- buted to you. Come, cheer up, my dear boy! It will all come out right at last, no doubt." "True," replied Henry: ,( there is no reme- dy until we reach Liverpool. After seeing my father and home-friends, I must then return immediately to Boston, and redeem  my pro- mise made to a doomed man, and witnessed by the Eternal; for I shall never know a mo- ment's real enjoyment until my hands and heart are free from that troublesome af- fair." 21  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7378-00000124"/> 242 CHAPTER XXXIV. DEATH OF HENRY SINCLAIR'S PARENTS.-HENRY'S UNRE- DEEMED PROMSE. - HS SECOND VOYAGE TO AMERICA. --VISITS THE OLD FISHERMAN. - TAKES THE YELLOW CHLD HOME. ON arriving at Liverpool, Henry found his father very low, but greatly rejoiced to see his son. He survived for several months on the verge of the grave. It was impossible for his son to leave him in that state with any hopes of ever seeing him again.. How often Henry regretted ever having given his word to one so ill deserving,--the cause of all their trouble and loss! At such times, he felt tempted never to give the thing another thought; but then his word --that must be sacredly kept. He at length concluded to communicate the whole affair to his mother, and ask counsel of her. "It is impossible, my son," said she, "for you to go. You must write to the address of the packet, and state all the circumstances.   WNAIT AND SEE.     243 The person to whom it is directed must come to you. You can then deliver it with your own hands, and your word will not then be, compromised." "Right, dear mother,--always right," re- plied Henry.  And he wrote immediately, stating every particular respecting the manner in which he had received the packet; that he knew nothing of itgs contents, but was informed that it was of great importance. This letter he sent by the first conveyance, and felt quite relieved. Many months had passed.   Henry's father was no more; and the deep sorrow that op- pressed the mind of his son left little room for other cares. Nothing   had been heard from Boston in answer to Henry's letter. After waiting a few months, he wrote again, thinking that: his first letter had not been received. He waited six months longer, but received no answer. He then felt absolved, in a measure, from any farther duty; and there the matter rested.  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7378-00000125"/> 244     WAIT AND SEE. Time passed on. His mother survived her husband but. a few months, and then followed him through the dark valley. His sisters were married, - the youngest to Frank Howard,- and settled in their own homes. Henry Sinclair now inhabited a bachelor's home; but found it very desolate, notwith- standing his abundant wealth. When did mere wealth ever make a human being happy? He sauntered about, restless and unhappy. His life seemed aimless; and, having no check on his liberty and pursuits, he suddenly re- solved to revisit America, and, if possible, redeem his promise, so long deferred; think- ing " better late than never." His voyage to America was pleasant. On arriving in Boston, he went directly to the street and number specified on the packet, and rang the door-bell. A footman answered his summons. On inquiring for Capt. Winthrop, he was informed that the gentleman did not reside there: the footman said he knew of no person of that address. But, on making fur- ther inquiry, he gathered the information, that   WAIT AND SEE.     245 Capt. Winthrop, a well-known and highly re- spected merchant of that city, had been dead a long time; that he left no relatives in the city, except his daughter,-an only child. She had married; but her present name was not recollected. She had left the city after their failure, and their residence had been un- known even to her former friends. He then felt obliged to give over the pursuit, but thought he would run down to Cape Ann and see the old fisher, and hear from the little mulatto. He found her with the old couple, who had become very infirm. She had grown quite tall, and much lighter complexioned. He could scarcely believe she was the same child. The old couple were delighted to see Henry, and recognized him at a glance; for to him, under Divine Providence, they felt that they owed their lives. He offered to take the child, and keep her until somebody claimed her, as they were getting too aged to educate her. They cheerfully consented, as it would be bet- ter for the child, and themselves too;, and they 21*  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7378-00000126"/> 246      WAIT AND SEE. had no fears of being deceived as they had been before. They knew Henry too well not to feel unbounded confidence in him. It was therefore settled that she should remain with them until Henry came to take her to his own home. When he returned to Liverpool, he took the little girl to his mansion, and placed her under the care of a maiden aunt who presided over his household. He appointed a nurse, aV go- verness, and a nursery-maid to attend her; in- tending to fit her for the station to which, he doubted not, she belonged. He felt sure that she was not colored by any thing but art. He recollected hearing the pirates, in their last conference together, speak of "bill of sale," "slaves," " stained," &amp;c. He could catch but now and then a word when -they spoke incau- tiously. But, putting it all together now, he made up his mind that this child was a victim of their treachery, and intended by them for a Southern slave-market. He therefore deter- mined to make her all the amends in his power: hence such attention and appoint-   WAIT AND SEE.     -247 ments for her. She grew fairer and more beautiful every day: her mental powers seemed to be unfolding from their temporary oblivion. On hearing the word "Effie " spoken, said she, "That is my name!" Sinclair kept the packet, intending, when she was twelve years of age, to open it, and let her know its contents; thinking it better to defer it until then. In the mean time, she was legally adopted into the family, and took the name of Sinclair. She soon became a very great favorite of the whole household, espe- cially with her self-constituted guardian; and nothing was spared that could in any way conduce to her advantage or enjoyment.  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7378-00000127"/> 248 CHAPTER XXXV.

What will my brother and his family think of me, when they are informed of my protracted stay in this city, and within a few miles of their residence . " When he assured Mrs. Huntley that he must run down to Ryfield the next day, she -said, "We shall miss you: how we shall miss you! But we must try to forget ourselves for a few days, while you are visiting that dear family, who hold a claim on your presence and regards beyond ours, at present."

"Duty has made that decision, my dear lady; for, had I dared to consult my inclinations, I probably should have been unable to tear my- self from the powerful spell that has so long held me not only a willing, but a delighted captive. You comprehend?" "I do, Mr. Atherton. Your speaking of captivity reminds me, that I have sometimes seen two captives, both guilty of the same crime, handcuffed and chained together, and both imprisoned in one cell." "Astonishing!" exclaimed Edward, laugh- ing joyously. "I must endeavor to escape such, trying' scenes, and shall therefore find safety only in flight." "If you are resolved to go, may I trou- ble you with a few lines to your brother's wife ." "Certainly, my dear friend. Is there any thing more in my power to do for you or your friend? Ahem! Would not Mrs. Dorset in-  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7378-00000128"/> 2.50     WAIT AND SEE. trust me with some. little commission from her?" "Thanks for us both. She will soon be in. For myself, I have something that I would ask your attention to, were it not for the fear of giving you too much trouble." "Name it, my dear Mrs. Huntley," said he. "You can ask nothing that I should not be happy to perform. Nothing could give me greater pleasure." "Thank you, Mr. Atherton. I have been thinking, that, if a convenient opportunity should offer, Alfred and Lizzie would like to go to Ryefield and visit their parents. Do you recollect the Darleys, who live in the vicinity of the mill, - not very far from your brother's residence?" "I do, perfectly; and, with your permission, shall take them in charge with great plea- sure." Alfred Darley and Lizzie Huntley, as we must now call her, entered the carriage at an early hour the next morning. Mr. Atherton allowed Alfred to drive. This gave Alfred   WAIT AND SEE.      251 great pleasure. Lizzie, radiant with gladness and beauty, was a model that a painter might well covet. Indeed, nothing could present a more attractive appearance than the three handsome, happy faces that looked out from that comfortable carriage on that delightful morning. Edward allowed Alfred to drive directly to his father's house; when he sprang out, and shook hands with Uncle Ben and Aunt Nabby, saying, 1, Allow me to lend you a couple of valuable jewels. Keep them until I call for them; which will probably be in a week or two." Saying this, he sprang into the car- riage, and drove over to the parsonage. The children's parents almost wept for joy at seeing their darlings, and seeing them look so healthy and happy. The other two chil- dren, Ezra and Anna, received them  rather coolly.  Looking at the new-comers with a leering look, Ezra made out to say, "How d'ye do?  Well, both on ye?" "Very well, thank   you," replied' Alfred proudly.  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7378-00000129"/> 252      WAIT AND SEE. Lizzie said nothing, but eyed them with a proud, indifferent, disgusted look. Uncle Ben bade Ezra go and kill " one of them fattest hens" for dinner. Ezra obeyed the command with -a sour, sullen look; but dared not re- -fuse. "Come, be spry!" said Aunt Nabby. "The darlin' critters hev rid so fur, they'll need an airly dinner." "I guess I shall hurry myself a good deal," muttered Ezra in an undertone to himself. "Anna, why don't you stir your stumps, and put things to rights?" said her mother. "What will your little sister think, coming right out of a perfect palace a'most, to see every thing topsyturvy? ;Ef you hadn't a been idlin' and quidlin' round, you mout er had every thing in its place afore now. 'Tis 'nuf to make the darlin' homesick. Lizzie, don't you want a doughnut, dear " "No, thank you," said the proud little beau- ty, with a contemptuous toss of her glossy ringlets. "I will take a little blanc-mange, if you please, madam."   WAIT AND SEE'.      253 "What on airth is the child talking about? What kind of stuff is it?" She gave her mother a freezing look, saying, "It's time you knew, madam." "What color is it, Lizzie?" said her mother, not heeding her hauteur. With a contemptuous frown, Miss Lizzie replied, "It is of no particular color. I don't wish for any now, if you please." Her mother felt hurt that there was nothing in the house that the child could eat. At the parsonage, there was much rejoicing at Edward's return; which they expressed in looks and acts as well as words. Fanny seemed very anxious to hear from Arielle, but appeared to have forgotten Fred entirely. Mrs. Atherton had read her letter, and, ap pearing much gratified, said, "We are all invited to spend Thanksgiving in the city: not one is to be left at home. You will not be at a loss to tell where." "Not at all," replied the Rev. Mr. Ather- 22  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7378-00000130"/> 254     WAIT AND SEE.  ton; "but you know, love, that we are expect- ing our boy home at that time to spend his vacation." "Very true, dear; but he is especially in- cluded in the invitation." "Very good, so far; but we seem to forget that our brother might not choose to ac- cept"-- "He does, though," replied Edward, "with many thanks." "Shall I write an acceptance?" said Mrs. Atherton. "Why, yes, dearest: I think we may ven- ture to do so. -You are sure, my dear Ed- ward, that you choose to go? I suppose to oblige us, you think?" "Not so, my dear brother: you will be con- vinced of that." "Well, then, my beloved, I have no farther objections to make; that is, if I can procure a substitute to supply my pulpit in our ab- sence." It was now about two Weeks of Thanks-   WAIT AND SEE.     255 giving, and it was fully decided for all to go. That matter being settled, and a note of accept- ance sent to the Huntleys, the little group had gathered about the hearth-stone in full enjoy- ment of domestic happiness; when old Juba came rushing in out of breath, exclaiming, "Mas'r Ed'ard! Bress you darlin' soul! Where am you comed from?   Gorrey! dis nigger 'gun to be feared you 'sconded Ha, ha, he!" cried he, shaking his master Edward's hand, and slapping him familiarly on the shoulder. On being told that they were all invited to Mr. Huntley's to spend Thanksgiving, and that he was to go also, he could scarce contain himself for joy. "Why, missis! You too good to dis ole darkee, dat is sartin. Neber was sich good massa and missis! Mas'r Ed'ard too! I so happy, dat I dusent hardly know whedder I here or some udder good place. He, he, he!" The next morning, the two brothers just looked in at the Crown and Anchor, and were received by its owners, Mr. and Mrs. Bolton,  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7378-00000131"/> 256      WAIT AND SEE. with the greatest stretch of politeness within their reach. They were little changed: the same bustling, self-sufficient pair as formerly; hoarding up wealth as if it were their chief good, and apparently having no higher aim, no purer motive. Alas! how many such there are in this world of ours! The brothers had much confidential dis- course together on various subjects. "I hope, my dear brother," said Edward, "that you will not always pen your fold in this sequestered spot. Suppose you should receive a call to return to Philadelphia?" "I consider that hardly a supposable case," replied the parson. "And why not?" said Edward earnestly. "Oh! I am too simple to please a fastidious city congregation, Edward." "And where, my reverend brother, could you find a more fastidious, stiff, self-sufficient, aristocratic set than in Ryefield . - not the re- fined, intellectual aristocracy of a city, but a set of purse-proud, bigoted, stingy, ignorant -boors!"   RWAIT AND SEE.      257 "O Edward, my dear boy! pray restrain such sarcastic feelings, or rather expressions; for I know you too well to think for a moment that those remarks came fronm your noble, ge- nerous heart.  It will not do for unskilful hands like ours to attempt pulling up the tares; for we should be very likely to pull up the wrong plants. 'Therefore we'll check our wayward feet Before they trample on the wheat.'" "I stand corrected, my dear brother. For- give my impromptu rashness: it was but a fancy speech. But I have a serious question to propose. If you should receive a call to settle in our native city, would you accept it?' "I would, my brother, provided the call was from the right source." "Good! One point is gained!" cried Ed- ward joyfully. In this pleasant manner, the brothers en- joyed day after day together. Mrs. Atherton and Fanny were deeply engaged in making preparations for their Thanksgiving visit. Mr. 22*  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7378-00000132"/> 258      WAIT AND SEE. Atherton was to have a new suit of clothes for the occasion, and Juba was to have the old ones. The old fellow said, he " hoped dey not 'spect him to set in de pulpit at Bossun, kaze he beb on massa's brack coat. Wha, ha, ha!"   259 CHAPTER XXXVI. THE BROTHER'S PREDICTION.-THE HAPPY MEETING. EDWARD ATHERTON took an opportunity, when he and his brother were taking a long walk, to open his whole heart to him respecting his attachment to Alexa. "I had suspected that something of that nature agitated your mind, before you confided it to me," replied Mr. Atherton. "And let me tell you, my brother, that you have chosen wisely and well; and may Heaven prosper your suit!" "But do you think that I shall succeed in winning that choice, brother?. There is the rub." "I certainly have no reason to doubt it, Edward. She must be apathetic indeed if she can feel indifference towards one so every way qualified as yourself to make her happy. I i  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7378-00000133"/> 260      WAIT AND SEE. make no pretensions to divination, although we are termed ' divinity students;' but I feel a prophetic inspiration that I shall have the happiness of embracing Alexa as a sister within one year." "Heaven bless you, my precious brother! Your words have made me happy; for I know that you use no words but those of candid truth." The two brothers returned to the parsonage in excellent spirits. Edward, wishing to be loved for himself alone, kept his immense wealth a profound secret from every one, old Juba excepted; but he often made valuable presents to his brother's family. The two weeks passed rapidly away, and the time had arrived to think of returning to Boston; when Theodore made his most wel- come appearance for his college vacation, and was delighted to hear that he was invited to the place where, of all others, he most desired to go. Alfred and Lizzie were to return with the party. Uncle Ben and Aunt Nabby had   WAIT AND SEE.      261 received a present from Mr. Huntley, in the form of a roll of bank-bills; which he wisely concluded would benefit them more than an invitation to Thanksgiving. The party set out for the city in two car- riages; and a happier party, we venture to say, is not often seen between Ryefield and Boston. The note of invitation specified a genuine family visit; entreating them to make arrange- ments to prolong their visit until the New Year. (Do not be surprised, gentle reader: hospitality was fashionable at the time to which we refer.) Nothing could exceed the exuberance of happy feelings manifested by the Huntleys on the arrival of their guests; which was duly reciprocated by them.  We feel quite sure that more genuine happiness was never felt by any one circle below the skies. Arielle blushed deeply when she presented her hand to welcome Theodore, and per- formed that courtesy with less grace than usual. Frederic bowed, and touched his lips  &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7378-00000134"/> 262      WAIT AND SEE. to the hand of the -beautiful Fanny, with an air of gallantry that would have done credit to a French dancing-master: but he was perfectly self-possessed; which would have proved to a practised eye that his boyish fancy was like most such ephemeral hobbies, - evanescent, and nearly evaporated.   263 CHAPTER XXXVII. A SCOLDING WOMAN. - THE DRUNKARD'S "AMEN." 'THE HAUGHTY LITTLE BEAUTY. - PARENTAL DISCIPLINE. ALFRED DARLEY ran gayly to the counting- house, inwardly determined not to be caged again at his own home. "To think," solilo- quized he as he passed along, " of their setting me to chop wood! And then mother is for ever scolding. I wonder now how I ever bore it. May the Lord deliver me from a scolding woman!" "Amen!" shouted a voice at his elbow; for Alfred, in his earnestness, had spoken the last sentence in an audible voice, and was replied to by a tipsy fellow, who had reeled very near to him, and whom Alfred, in his revery, had not before observed. He colored crimson, supposing the fellow had heard the whole; but felt very thankful that it was nobody but a drunkard.  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7378-00000135"/> 264     WAIT AND SEE. Lizzie, on being asked by Mrs. Dorset if she had a pleasant visit, said, "No, madam. If you please, I don't ever wish to go to that old, ugly place again." "Why, Lizzie!" exclaimed Mrs. Huntley. "Do you not feel very sorry that you have made that naughty answer to so kind a question " "No, madam," was her laconic reply. "Is it possible that you have forgotten the commandment to honor your parents, Lizzie?" Lizzie pouted and reddened for a moment, and then said, "If you please, mamma, the commandment does not say love; and I don't love that old cross, homely mother, - always scolding." "Oh, I am perfectly astonished!" said Mrs. Huntley. Lizzie, never let such words pass your lips again! And, to impress it on your mind, go directly to the inner nursery, and remain there until I send for you; which will not be until you are humbled into repentance." And Lizzie trudged off, swelling and sobbing, into banishment.   WAIT AND SEE.     265 Mrs. Dorset had fully redeemed her promise of motherly kindness and attention to the Darley children; and Mrs. Huntley had done the same, - even to adopting the youngest into their own name. But too much indul- gence, and admiration of her beauty, had neutralized their efforts, and made her, as we have seen, a proud, wilful, troublesome child. Her banishment to the inner nursery was her first punishment since she had been under their care: but Mrs. Huntley now saw and felt the necessity of checking her imperious temper immediately; and, with much regret, commenced what had too long been elayed. Thanksgiving morning rose clear and bright. All was pure affection and happiness in that hospitable mansion. Mr. Atherton was invited to express their united thankfulness, and ado- ration before the Most High; which he did in his own fervent, humble, eloquent manner: and the carving and serving commenced. "Where is our darling Lizzie?" asked Mr. Huntley. 23    &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7378-00000136"/> 266      WAIT AND SEE. ("She is in the nursery," replied his wife with an expressive gesture and a beseeching look, which he perfectly understood, and said, "Ah! very well;" and changed the subject. All was animation and delight.  Merry voices echoed around that plenteous board. It was, indeed, " the feast of reason and the flow of soul." -"Perhaps we are rather too selfish," said Mrs. Huntley: "but we are desirous of skimming the cream of this visit to ourselves exclusively, -that is, to enjoy its freshness in our own little domestic circle; and therefore, if agree- able to our guests, have decided to defer the party we are intending to give while they are with us, until one week from this, that we may spend this happy day with them in social enjoyment, free from restraint. Does this plan meet the approbation of our friends!" "Entirely!" "Perfectly!" was echoed simul- taneously from all present. The table was then dismissed by Mr. Ather- ton, and the guests disposed of themselves in various ways until the bells summoned them   l [Y'--  WAIT AND SEE.      267 to the house of divine worship;-where the Rev. Mr. Atherton, by special invitation, delivered an address suited to the occasion, which was deep, clear, sublime, and eloquent: so thought his audience. Before going out, Mrs. Huntley had sent to Lizzie to-ask if she was sorry for her naughti- ness. But no answer could be obtained: she remained sulky, and would not speak. Mrs. Huntley then ordered that bread and milk be carried to her, but nothing more, until she was humbled; charged Lizzie's nurse to serve her with her own hands, but not to speak a word to her unlessit was absolutely necessary; and to let no one-else enter the room. Some might:?eem Mrs. Huntley's discipline rather arbitrary-: -but, were there more just such decision in the government of families, it would be far better for mankind in general. Parents who suffer themselves, through a foolish fondness, to be governed by their children until they are six or seven years of age, cannot expect to take the government into their own hands then, and be obeyed,  &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7378-00000137"/> 268      WAIT AND SEE. unless by severe chastisement.  The first dawning of -evil passions and ill temper in a child should be judiciously curbed; but the parents must first learn to curb their own tempers. There are parents who will beat their children unmercifully, if they feel angry themselves; but, if they chance to be in a pleasant mood, then the " little darlings " can disobey them with impunity. Do what they will, say what they will, it is all " beautiful" with the misguiding parents.  This is an every-day fact, which needs no comment.   269 CHAPTER XXXVIII. THE BOW-WINDOW.-UNDERSTOOD, BUT NOT EXPRESSED.- MSS DINAH'S DINNER. - JUBA OFFICIATES. JUBA AND DINAH TETE -.A- TTE. AFTER the party returned from worship, a splendid dinner was served. Every thing was social and easy. The conversation was gene- ral and familiar. Before taking her seat at table, Mrs. Huntley sent to inquire if Lizzie was sorry that she was naughty; if so, she would come up herself, and hear her say so.  But Miss Lizzie an- swered, j' No, I'm not sorry: don't want her; don't love her!" "Very well," calmly replied Mrs. Huntley; and, being seated at table, she presided with much courtesy and grace. The golden hours sped , on doubly swift wings on that gloriously pleasant afternoon, and evening had long been waiting for admit- 23*  &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7378-00000138"/> 270      WAIT AND SEE. tance unheeded. The party had drawn off into select groups after dinner. Edward had gained the long-coveted posi- tion by the side of Alexa, and imperceptibly an interesting conversation ensued. It must have been deeply interesting, to judge from the heightened color of Alexa's complexion: but the precise words and sentences we leave the reader to guess at as we did; not being an eavesdropper, by any means. No, indeed: we should scorn the idea of such a thing! Theodore and Arielle were sitting in a bow- window, concealed, in part, by its crimson drapery; and no doubt it was the reflection of that which gave to the faces in its proximity such " celestial rosy red." Their attachment, like Night's mild planet, was calm, pure, and gentle; gradually and truly ascending from its eastern sky. Theodore had yet to graduate, and take orders in the ministry, as was his expectation, before he could aspire to the hand of his heart's elect. This chained his tongue on the subject of his tenderest thoughts; but suffice it to say, they had read each other's   WAIT AND SEE.      271 thoughts, each other's heart, and were satisfied to remain in that blissful state until the time should come when their affections might take words, and the- crowning touch of Hy- men's wand render them more, completely blest. The servants' table in the kitchen was amply spread with all the rich delicacies which so bountifully covered the first table. Dinah (the colored cook) and Juba were to do the honors of the table. Juba was appointed out of courtesy, being a guest. He sat oppo- site to Dinah, and commenced carving. "-Misse Dinah, what piece ob de turkey shall I heb de preasure to 'stend to you?" "Tank you, Mr. Juba, I no ways 'tickelar." "Hab you no preferaments at all, Misse Dinah?" Well, 'pose I trouber you for a mite ob de wing?" "Wid preasure, Misse Dinah. Will you 'mit me to add a trifle of de - de - bosom, it so condigenal to de fair sek? He, he, he!"  &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7378-00000139"/> 272      WAIT AND SEE. "Oney a mite, den, Mr. Juba; I so delikit an' abstremerous in my appetite." All at table were politely helped, but were told by Dinah to " hep theysevs, and not to 'spect any compriments." After the repast, and every thing being put to rights, the other servants dispersed in dif- ferent directions, as their fancy led, until tea-time. Thus the nice, pleasant kitchen was left to the sole occupancy of Miss Dinah and Mr. Juba. And who shall say that they did not enjoy the passing hours as completely as their more highly privileged fellow-beings of the drawing-room  "Bliss is the same, in subject or in king."   273 CHAPTER XXXIX. "TTLE LIZZIE.-A SPLENDID PARTY.-EDWARD AND ALEXA. IT. was now one week since Thanksgiving, and the large party to come off at Mr. Huntley's was expected that evening. Whole families, comprising all ages, had been invited. Mrs. Huntley had sent regularly every day to see if Lizzie was humbled enough to " strike her colors," and say that she was sorry for her naughtiness. She had been plentifully sup- plied with nice bread and milk, but very much missed the endearments and nice delicacies to which she had been of late accustomed. Her will was by this time completely subdued; and, when inquired of on the day of the party, she said, "Yes, I'm sorry. Mamma is good. I've been naughty." Mrs. Dorset and Mrs. Huntley heard this communication with great joy; for they acted   &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7378-00000140"/> 274      WAIT AND SEE. in concert respecting their little pet. Both ran up to the nursery, impatient to see and caress the little penitent. She rushed to, meet them, saying, "I'm sorry I'm so naughty!" and kneeled voluntarily as in her little prayers, saying, "Pray, forgive me, mamma and Mrs. Dorset!" "Certainly, my love," cried both ladies, and were about to raise and embrace her; when she said, "Please let me ask Him first. - Our Father, I've been a very wicked girl. I'm very sorry. Please to forgive me this time. I'll never do so again. Amen!" She then alternately rushed into the arms of both the ladies, receiving the fondest en- dearments and caresses from those tender- hearted twin-sisters in gospel charity and love. The splendid mansion of the Huntleys was open for receptions at an early hour. The evening was fine; and even the fashionables (who were unavoidably invited), knowing the republican habits of their entertainers, arrived   WAIT AND SEE.      275 early. Nothing elegant, tasteful, or comforta- ble, was wanting to render the entertainment all that could be desired. There were different rooms appointed for the different ages of the guests, yet so arranged that all might circulate freely from room to room at pleasure. Each room was brilliantly lighted with wax-lights, which made every object appear still more beautiful. Mr. and Mrs. Huntley sat in the reception- room to welcome their guests, and to introduce such as were not already acquainted to the Athertons and Mrs. Dorset, who sat on either hand, and who assisted them in doing the honors of the evening. A slight description of the ladies' dresses must not be omitted on this interesting occa- sion; for that would spoil the whole story with many of our lady readers (we beg their pardon for so poor a compliment). Mrs. Dorset appeared in a genteel but very dimple suit of half-mourning; Mrs. Huntley and Mrs. Atherton, each in a dark-purple satin dress, close-fitted to the bust, with blonde  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7378-00000141"/> 276     WAIT AND SEE. edging at the neck, fastened at the throat with a small diamond; head-dresses of blonde, and very simple: they were dressed precisely alike in every respect. Arielle wore a white crape dress, - low, tight bodice, -with short sleeves; pearl necklace and bracelets, with ear- rings and pin to match; dress trimmed with white silk-velvet and blonde lace. Her hair was put back entirely plain, with the excep- tion of a light, wavy ringlet at each temple. Though merely pretty in general, Arielle appeared very beautiful on that occasion; at least, she appeared to be the chief attraction among a host of beauties on that evening of competition. Fanny wore white Swiss-muslin made perfectly plain, and no ornaments: her splendid hair hung loose in wavy curls, and entirely unadorned save by her own brilliant beauty and loveliness, which were very attrac- tive. Frederic thought so, if we may judge from appearances. He scarcely left her side during the evening, unless compelled by com- mon politeness to show a few momentary attentions to the other young ladies. She   WAIT AND SEE.     2" was his particular star among all that bright galaxy of misses in their teens; himself the worshipped idol of many fondly beating hearts the while. Lizzie, richly dressed, was brought in by her nurse, and taken through the whole suite of rooms. "Heavens! what a beauty!" "What an angel!" "How divinely lovely!" was echoed from room to room as she passed. It took the nurse more than an hour to- make the tour of the apartments, and to answer questions respecting the child; the eyes of the proud little queen flashing with gratified pride and vanity the while, - extending her dimpled hand for her admirers to kiss, but not allow- ing them to touch her face. When the nurse approached the stairs to return with her young charge, "No, no," cried Lizzie: " please, don't go yet! They want to see me longer, nursey, I'm so pretty!"But "nursey" thought it time to retire: and Lizzie dared not resist, remem- bering the penalty she had so recently paid for her stubbornness; and, like a prudent general, surrendered when resistance was useless. 24  &#xD;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7378-00000142"/> 278      WAIT AND SEE. But we have not yet finished the description of the ladies' dresses: indeed, it would be next to impossible to go into detail. Suffice it to say, that every style of dress and every style of beauty adorned that coterie, and every thing came off just right. As for the conversation, we cannot relate any of that; for so many subjects were being discussed by so many different voices, that we could not make out a single sentence! At twelve o'clock, the party broke up, and returned to their homes, delighted with the pleasant evening they had passed. The next morning, calls were made in pro- fusion by the ladies who were of Mrs. Huntley's party. Said Miss Smith, "Were you not delighted last evening . " "Perfectly!" said Miss Gray. "What sim- ple elegance was displayed throughout the whole! Don't you think so?" "Indeed I do. 'Tis said that Mr. Huntley is a millionnaire." "He ought to be, to give such parties, and be so benevolent besides."   WAIT AND SEE.      279 Here Mrs. Holbrook and Mrs. Fisher were announced. After the compliments of the morning, said Mrs. Fisher, "How did you like the younger Mr. Atherton, ladies?" "In truth," replied Miss Smith, "I did not observe him." "Did not observe him! How could you avoid it? It was he who turned the leaves of music for our Blanche.  How  pleased and spell-bound he appeared while she was playing!" "Ah! he is only the son of a country clergyman, and  is said to be mortgaged besides. Therefore, marvel not if he has no attractions for me." "What a perfect beauty Huntley's son is!" said Miss Gray. "Did you see the Rev. Mr. Atherton's brother?" said Miss Smith. "He was the finest-looking gentleman there, I think; and rich as Croesus, 'tis said: but he had eyes for nobody but that demure-looking widow, who scarcely moved the whole evening." "Who was that lovely creature, in white  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7378-00000143"/> 280      WAIT AND SEE. crape, who played the organ so splendidlyt" inquired Mrs. Holbrook. "And that lovely little cherub in white muslin, entirely plain, who stood by her side, and sung so sweet- ly?" "The first was Arielle, only daughter of Philip Huntley, Esq., where we were received last evening: the other was Fanny, only daughter of the Rev. Mr. Atherton. Was she not beautiful " "Very!" was the response from them all. "t What beautiful child was that who was passed through the rooms about nine o'clock, led by her nurse, as I suppose her to be?" inquired Mrs. Fisher; but no one could inform her. Much information was sought, on that particular morning, by different groups who gathered to discuss the party, the entertainers, the company, &amp;c.; which is generally attended to on the following day. The golden hours had passed very rapidly at the Huntley mansion, and - all too soon -   WAIT AND SEE.      281 brought around the oft-protracted time for the departure of the Atherton Family. It was arranged between them all, before parting, that they were to form a little domestic party early in the ensuing spring, and travel together to visit England, and perhaps France, Italy, and other places. Theodore, of course, could not make one of the party, gratifying as it would be to them all; for he must shortly return to college life, and toil for the "A M." until it was obtained. The intercourse between the families was regularly kept up during the remainder of the winter; and Edward seemed to have very frequent calls to the city, which detained him there the greater part of his time.  But, reader, we have something to communicate, which you will doubtless be delighted to hear. Edward and Alexa have exchanged vows,- vows of love, faith, and devotion. What do you think of that  The marriage is to be solemnized by the Rev. Mr. Atherton, at the present residence of Alexa, on the 3d of April, 24*  &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7378-00000144"/> 282        WAIT AND SEE. - the morning of their departure on their foreign tour; or rather " bridal tour" seems the most appropriate term. "Affection's bonds are oft thus torn, And even Love forgets to mourn."   283 CHAPTER XL. HENRY SINCLAIR BECOMES LORD MORETON.- HS ADOPTED CHLD. - SHE SIGHS FOR A MOTHER. - BREAKING THE SEAL OF THE MYSTERIOUS PACKET.-ITS CONTENTS.- THE VOYAGE TO AMERICA. HENRY SINCLAIR, by the death of a relative in the male line, had succeeded to the title and estates inherent in his family; and consequent- ly became Lord Moreton, and a member of Parliament. Still, Effie Sinclair, who was now completely restored from the effects of the narcotic potions which had so nearly destroyed her senses, was his petted idol. She had now become a very bright, intelligent child; and was an object of deep interest and affection with his lordship. With his increasing inte- rest in her, he felt an increasing desire to un- ravel the mystery in which she was shrouded. There was but one way, - the packet. He at once decided that it was his duty to open, it, and repaired to the library for that  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7378-00000145"/> 284      WAIT AND SEE.       t purpose; but he found Effie sitting there, with her head resting on her hand, apparently in deep, sorrowful thought. "Effie, darling! what troubles you, my love?" said he, tenderly embracing her as a father would a cherished daughter. "I am thinking, dear guardy, how happy I should be if I had a mother. I do not need any father but yourself." "Effie," said he, "it is very gratifying to have you appreciate me so kindly; and this appears to be a favorable time to inform you of your history, so far as it is known to me. I have in my possession a sealed packet, which I have hitherto withheld from your knowledge, as it was not designed for me to open. That it relates to you, to your birth and parentage, I have no doubt; but have long been seeking and waiting for the only person who has a right to break the seal." "Oh!" exclaimed she, " pray, open it! Per- haps I have a mother, my dear Lord More- ton." "Call me ' guardy,' Effie, if you please: the   WAIT AND SEE.      285 title sounds too formal, especially when it is so new and strange to me. Effie, have you any recollections of your parents?" "I have, dear guardian; or it may have been a dream: but I have seen, or dreamed I saw, a beautiful, tender mother and a fond father, but not so dear to me as yourself" (here a flood of tears prevented her utter- ance) " and dear grandpapa," sobbed she. "What did they call him? ." inquired More- ton.- "They called him' father;' but the servants called him Capt. Winthrop," replied she with a hopeful look. Henry, whom we shall in future call More- ton, sprang from his seat, opened a secret drawer in his escritoire, and brought forth the packet, showing her the address. She nearly fainted with joyful surprise, saying, "Open it! pray, open it! It is my grand- father's name!" "I will," said he, " on condition that you- retire until I have first read it alone." To this she cheerfully consented, and with-  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7378-00000146"/> 286      WAIT AND SEE. drew. With a trembling hand he broke the seal,-for it freshened painful memories,- and read the will and confession of Seymour, the pirate; the contents of which are mostly known to our readers. He summoned Effie at once, and communicated the contents to her. Placing the document in her own hands, he said, "My only object in reading it first, dar- ling, was to see if there was any thing you ought not to know at present; but there is not. I now regret not having done before what would have been right under the cir- cumstances. I find that it is possible to carry even a sense of honor too far." He then left Effie to read the document and to her own reflections, charging her to return the papers to their secret drawer when she left the library. In the evening, Lord Moreton, being disen- gaged, summoned his ward to the library. 1"Effie," said he, " would you like to go to your inheritance? I think the will locates it in Virginia." "It-does. I should like to see it; but" ---   WAIT AND SEE.     287 - "But what, my love? I am to accompany you. You did not suppose that I intended to send you from me, did you?" "No, not that," said -she; " but I thought first of my - my mother!" "True, child: we are to attend to that at the same time. We will visit the New-Eng- land States; go to Philadelphia, New York, Boston, and the whole rounds. We will visit Cape Ann, and find the old fisherman who had a hand in saving both of our lives, Effie. I will give immediate orders for our baggage to be ready, and berths secured in the first good vessel bound to America." "Oh, I shall be so delighted!" said she. "But, guardy," cried she with a terrified look, "what will keep, the pirates from catching us again?" "( They are dead, my dear; and, if they were not, can you think of no protection?" "Yes: Heaven. But perhaps the angels might not be watching, and we might be taken as we were before." Moreton could scarce suppress a- smile at   &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7378-00000147"/> 288      WAIT AND SEE. her guileless distrust; but said, "I hope that God himself will be our guard." This appeared to satisfy her. She seemed willing to trust in God; '" for," said she,- " it was he who saved us at last from the pi- rates, after the angels let them catch us." "Good orthodox reasoning, my little di- vine," said he, affectionately patting her cheek. "We must now exchange the good-night kiss. There, now ring for your femme," said Moreton, throwing himself on a lounge of exquisite beauty and softness, where he lay in deep re- very for a long time respecting his young charge and his future plans in general. Effie lay in her downy bed draped with rich lace and counterpaned with crimson silk velvet splendidly wrought, with window drapery to match. Every thing in the room and about her was in keeping. She had happy dreams that night. It seemed that an entire new world had opened to her view. She saw again the same lovely mother smiling and caressing her; but, when she looked in her dream for her father, a stranger would stand in his stead.   WAIT AND SEE.      289 But that gave her little uneasiness, as it was a mother she pined for. Moreton had taken care that she should not feel the want of a father. In a very short time, they were equipped for their voyage to America; and, as it would be rather chilly at the North so early in the spring, Moreton decided to take his young charge directly to her plantation. Their voy- age was very pleasant; and Effie enjoyed it completely, except when a vessel hove in sight: she then would run to her guardian, panting with fear and apprehension, to ask him whether it was not pirates, and if he thought the angels were watching. 25  &#xD;<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7378-00000148"/> 290 CHAPTER   XLI. VISIT TO THE PLANTATION.--- THE SLAVERY QUESTION DEBATED. ON their arrival at Virginia, Moreton proceed- ed directly with his charge to the dwelling of the agent whom Seymour had named in his will as his executor; where they were politely received, and invited to remain during their stay in Virginia. Moreton and the agent had a lengthy conversation together that evening in the library. Mr. Hill, the agent, was very glad to have the estate settled and off his hands. 1"When I took it in charge," he said, "I had no mistrust or suspicion of the real cha- racter of its owner, until Seymour's last letter confessed it. I could not then refuse the re- quest of one so soon to be executed for his crimes, and one, too, whom I had served when free and apparently prosperous; and have,   WAIT AND SEE.       291 therefore, carried out his orders respecting the estate, to the very letter; had free papers for all the slaves as he had directed, and then hired them at a fair price to work the plan- tation. Many of them are still in our service. The crops have had a good yield. Your ward will be quite an heiress, if she never should have any other fortune." "Yes," replied Moreton, musingly: " quite enough for a young lady. But a difficulty has just occurred to me. Her identity - that must be proved in order to substantiate her claim to the inheritance. '"That is very true," replied Hill; ,but you will be able to do that, I should sup- pose." Moreton sat silent- and thoughtful for a few moments, and then replied, "The packet con- taining the will and Seymour's confession I have, 'tis true; but the identity, I fear, will be rather difficult to prove. The will designates her name as Effie Dorset; but her now legal name,- by adoption, is Effie Sinclair,. I -must send to England, and obtain testimonials re-  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7378-00000149"/> 292      WAIT AND SEE. specting her adoption; and to Cape Ann to get the old fisherman's deposition, and that of his wife, that I took the child from them to Eng- land, and that Seymour took her -from them; which is all stated in the confession which his own hand penned and sealed." "Yes," replied Hill; "I suppose that the law will require all that formula: but, for myself, your own affirmation would be suffi- cient." "Thank you," replied Moreton; " but it is better to transact business-important busi- ness, I mean - in a legal form. Yet what is legally right may be morally wrong. For in- stance (pardon me), slavery is legally right here; and yet we see that even a pirate frees his slaves, when approaching death opens the eyes of his spiritual vision. What may we we infer from this, but that, in the light of an approaching eternity, he sees that slavery is morally wrong?" "Bah! Pardon me, sir," said Hill; "but you will be obliged to quote higher authority for the basis of your theory, before it will be   WAIT AND SEE.      293 popular in the enlightened State of old Vir- ginia! Ha, ha!" "Higher authority would not be lacking, nor is truth often popular," replied Moreton. "But, as business is the subject before us, let us first discuss that, if you please; and we will, if agreeable to you, renew on another occa- sion the subject we will now drop." "Certainly," replied Hill, but inwardly in- tending to parry the subject if Moreton should attempt to renew it. "I will write immediately to obtain the pro- per documents from England," said Moreton. "In the mean time, we shall make the tour of the Northern States-that is, a part of them- until this estate can be settled. If you should have any occasion to write me, direct to Boston, if you please. This is my address," said he, presenting a card of the most exquisite workmanship, engraved ," Hen- ry, Lord Moreton, Liverpool, Eng."   The agent took it with a most obsequious bow. "I wish the estate to be advertised for sale, Mr. Hill; as I now feel confident that I shall 25*  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7378-00000150"/> 294      WAIT AND SEE. be able to produce the necessary documents; and, if so, shall wish to put her property into another form directly." Hill then brought forward his books, show- ing a large balance in money derived from sale of the crops, after paying his help, the free slaves for their labor, and subtracting his own charges.   295 CHAPTER XLII. CRUELTY TO A FEMALE SLAVE.--THE HEARTLESS SOUTH- ERN GIRL. -EFFIE'S HEROISM. THE next morning had risen in unusual splen dor for the season. Effie, with a daughter of the agent, had gone out for an early walk. They found the morning so fine, that it had tempted them to prolong their walk until they were quite a distance from the mansion; when suddenly the air was rent with loud, piercing shrieks. "Heavens!" cried Effie. "' What is that . " The little girl laughed immoderately at her terror; and, as soon as she could speak with- out laughing, said gayly, "They are only whipping a negro." "How can you laugh 1 - oh, how can you t Let us return to- the house immediately!" sobbed Effie. "I am laughing to think they took so much  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7378-00000151"/> 296      WAIT AND SEE. pains to take the negro away down there, to be out of the hearing of the English visitors," replied the Southern girl. "And to think that you have found them, and are so struck up about it! Ha, ha, ha!" The anguished cries continued, louder, deeper, and more piercing. Effie waited to hear no more, but ran with her swiftest speed to an old building whence the blows and screeches came, and rushed behind it, where the merciless torture was being applied to the naked back of an aged female slave, who had fainted with fatigue in the field the day before, and therefore had failed of fully com- pleting her task. "Stop, in the name of God!" cried the now courageous Effie. "Strike not another blow!" And she fell fainting to the ground. Her exquisite beauty, commanding voice, and energetic manner, had struck the brutal overseer with a fearful idea that he had, like Balaam,- seen an angel; and he said in a quick under-voice, "Take the cussed nigger down! I'll owe her the rest, interest and all!"   WAIT AND SEE.      297 Effie was soon restored to consciousness: but seeing no slave, and hearing no cries, she was persuaded by the artful overseer that it was all imagination; that she had better not say any thing about it to any one, as it would be put down for nervousness, - a thing very much disliked in that place; and she would only be ridiculed if she was imprudent enough to drop even a hint about any part of it. Effie, though not convinced, agreed not to mention itf to any one; for she dared not do otherwise, when that horrible creature stood before her. A sedan, which the overseer had ordered, now arrived to take her back to the house. "I fear you have taken too long a walk, my love," said Moreton at breakfast. c"You look extremely pale." The agent's daughter looked at her with a mischievous smile, but motioned her not to tell the cause. Effie replied, that she did not feel quite well, but thought she should feel better when they went Noath.  &#xD;<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7378-00000152"/> 298      WAIT AND SEE. "My dear," said Mrs. Hill, " we hope you are not home-sick?" Effie could scarce drive back the words that disputed the passage to her tongue; but a deprecating look from the girl sealed her lips for that time.   299 CHAPTER   XLIII. REMNISCENCES.- THE PEA-BLOSSOMS. -EFFIE'S LIBERALI- TY. -GRATITUDE FOR A LONG-REMEMBERED KINDNESS. THE next morning, they set out upon their Northern journey.  They went directly to Boston, and put up at a hotel.  The next day they proceeded to Cape Ann to visit the old fisherman and his good wife. Moreton reflected, as they went, that he had better get their testimony at once, if they were living; considering the uncertainty of life even to the young, and " how much more," thought he, "to the aged!" They found them living, it is true, but very aged and feeble.  They could scarcely be made to believe that the bright, beautiful creature before them was the identical yellow child of former days. But she could now remember their kindness to her when they were her only protectors; and related some  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7378-00000153"/> 300      WAIT AND SEE. circumstances that occurred at that time, which removed their doubts at once. One anecdote from her memory we will here relate. It was the first and only time that the old lady had ever spoken an unkind word to her, and it made its impression all the deeper in her memory on that very account. One early June morning, when the sweet-pease were in full blossom, Effie, delighted with their bright colors, just picked off every one of them. After gathering her apron full, she sat down very demurely to tie them together into bouquets; having torn the strings from her little sun-bonnet for that purpose. When at the full height of her enjoyment, the old woman, who had come to the garden fence to hang her milk-pail on the stake to dry, hap- pened to look that way. She dropped the pail, and rushed into the garden,- to the very spot where Effie sat entirely absorbed in her fancy-work, heeding nothing else, until she heard the wrathful voice of the old woman almost screeching out, "You little sarpent! I'll be hanged if I ain't a good will to give   WAIT AND SEE.      301 you a plaguy licking! Will you let the vines alone? - you little hussy! Will you- ever dare to- go near them againt? "No, ma'am! no, ma'am!" said the!" yellow child," awfully frightened, and trembling from head to foot. The aged couple readily and cheerfully de- posed to the identity of Effie with the little yellow- child found as before stated. More- ton and his ward spent the day on the Cape, and travelled it over; viewing the charming scenery of Annisquam Point, Sandy Bay, and the Harbor. They carried the old fisherman and wife to see their former residence on the Flats. "Here,", said the old man, "-is the very old boat I took you from, my gal." ,' Is it indeed?" replied Effie. "--Is the boat still yours, sir?" "Oh, la, no! I didn't want it for nothin' and so I telled Bill Jones that he mought hev it for ten dollars; kaze I could put that in the till of my chist, but I couldn't the boat! 'r . " True," replied Effie; " and here is some' thing to go with the ten dollars, to keep them 26  &#xD;<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7378-00000154"/> 302      WAIT AND SEE. from being lonesome." And, laughing gayly, she put a purse into his hand, saying, ",Half for you, and half for the ' dame,' as she taught me to call her." She had asked and obtained her guardian's leave for this disposal of her pocket-money. The old man had stepped to a board laid across the head of a barrel, to get out his "specs" and count the money in the purse, and divide it on the spot. "Here, you! take yourn. They is jest ten pieces; five for you, old woman, and five for me." "Be the pieces all jest alike?" asked she. "Yis ; as near as so many white beans," replied he: and looking again, more closely, to see that he had made no mistake, perceived that the pieces were gold, - half-eagles. "This won't do," said he: " the child gin us goold-pieces, an' thort they was coppers!" Moreton, - who stood enjoying the scene, with Effie, who had hold of his hand,--greatly amused, now stepped forward, saying, "There is no mistake. My dear little wardy knew that the purse contained ten half-eagles,-   WAIT AND SEE.      303 just fifty dollars, - and so did I. It is all right: keep it." The- old couple were greatly rejoiced at receiving so valuable a present; but did not think to express any thanks, though they thought of something better. "Wife," said the old man, " we orter give some of this money to them that took us in, and warmed us an' fed us, that drefful night when we went, wet and cold and hungry, in the middle of the night, to their door, and called 'em up. I'll give 'em one of my goold- pieces, ef you will give 'em one o' yourn." ' Wal," said she, "I 'spect we orter du it." "What a humble lodging honesty, kindness, and gratitude have taken up with!" thought Moreton, as he stepped forward, saying, "Not out of that. Here are two more, just like those you have: give these to the kind persons who relieved you." He then took them to a hotel, and ordered an excellent dinner, to be served in a private room, for four. While this was being made ready, he made out the necessary papers to  &#xD;<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7378-00000155"/> 304      WAIT AND SEE. put them in possession of a life-annuity of four hundred dollars per annum, to be paid quarterly; and deposited a sum of money in a bank of that place, for the purpose. After dinner, he set them down at their own door, and shook the parting hand; while they wept like infants at the thought of never seeing him or his lovely ward again in this world. "Bless you! God Almighty bless you both!"- cried the poor old people, wringing the hands of their departing benefactor and their darling Effie.   305 CHAPTER XLIV. "ORD MORETON. - HS WARD. - HER PORTRAIT IN THE GALLERY, &amp;C. OUR travellers returned to Boston, and spent the time there very pleasantly. Effie had a great desire to obtain the portrait of herself which had been taken when she was the " little quadroon." They sought it at the Athenaeum; but, not finding it there, they visited every gallery of paintings and every artist's room, but to no purpose: they could find no trace of it. They returned to the Athenaeum; and Moreton sought the committee, who informed him that they had sold it to a gentleman whose name they could not recollect; but engaged to obtain- it if possible, if the young lady would sit for her own likeness for them, to adorn their gallery. Moreton thanked them for the compliment to his ward, and ordered a full- 26*  &#xD;<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7378-00000156"/> 306      WAIT AND SEE. length portrait of Effie at his own expense, - the portrait to be his own; but he would lend it to the Athenaeum until he wished to claim it. This splendid painting, when finished, and suspended in its proper niche, attracted the admiring gaze of thousands. It was a perfect idol with all amateurs, and lovers of the beautiful. The documents from England had safely ar- rived; and Moreton decided to go immediately to Virginia, where he found no difficulty in establishing Effie's claim to the plantation. A letter of guardianship from the Supreme Court of that State was readily granted to Moreton on his petition; that is, so far as they had legal power. Mr. Hill, the agent, had advertised the estate for sale, according to his directions; and several eager purchasers stood ready for a high bid, which run the sale very high. It was finally struck off at ninety thousand dol- lars. The, revenue of the estate amounted to ten thousand more. The slaves who had been owned on the place received liberal presents,   WAIT AND SEE.      307 -each according to their age, and term of slavery, - and were discharged. Our travellers now left, and returned to the Northern States. Effie's money was placed in secure banks, twenty thousand in each bank.

EFFIE'S PORTRAIT IN THE GALLERY 'OF THE ATHEN EUM.-- SURPRISE OF EDWARD AND ALEXA. ALL Boston had been to see the far-famed, splendid picture by Tintitian, - "The English beauty, niece and ward to Lord Moreton" (so said). Among the rest of the admiring crowd was Edward Atherton, Esq., with a beautiful lady, who "Hung upon his arm with fond, familiar air." NVhen they approached the picture, Edward started in astonishment, saying, "Alexa, what a resemblance to yourself!" "Who can be the original of that picture?" cried she. The catalogue only said,- as usual in such cases, "Portrait of a Young Girl." They then consulted the committee, but with no better success, farther than this: that she was an English heiress, Lord Moreton's niece; that   WAIT AND SEE.      309 they were about to return to England, and only waited to obtain information respecting a beautiful quadroon likeness which his lord- ship would like to purchase. "What reason did he give for wishing to obtain it?" asked Alexa, visibly agitated. "None, madam: he gave- no reason," was the laconic reply. She then conversed apart with Edward. He returned to the committee, saying, "I am the person who purchased the quadroon picture. Here is my address," giving his card. "The picture cannot be bought; but I will give an exact, perfect copy of it: for this painting of the' Young Girl,' from which they can have a copy taken if they desire it. This is the only condition on which I could give them a copy." Lord Moreton was sought by the committee at once, and Atherton's proposal communicated to him. "You will oblige me by making the ex- change directly," said his lordship; " or, if you wish to copy the one in your possession,  &#xD;<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7378-00000158"/> 310      WAIT AND SEE. you have our permission, as it can be done while the other is being copied." The copying was done in due time; and Moreton, after seeing that he had a correct copy from the original picture, took possession of the long-sought portrait; and the original picture of the "Young Girl "-which was to remain in the gallery until the copy was ready to take its place -was now owned by Edward Atherton, Esq., of Philadelphia. Time rolled on. It was now about the 1st of May. Nature was putting on her earliest, brightest charms; looking forward to the time when she might with propriety deck herself in the richer, more gorgeous hues of summer.   3" CHAPTER' XLVI. EDWARD ATHERTON AND HS BRIDE. - THEIR SPLENDID MANSION AND ITS APPOINTMENTS. -ILLNESS OF JUBA. THE third day of April had come and -passed; making, in its flight, Edward and Alexa a happy one. The rites were solemnized by the Rev. Mr. Atherton. The Huntleys and Athertons made only a bridal tour to New York; thence to Philadelphia: for Edward declared that he should never feel entirely at rest until his precious bird was in her own cage just long enough to see if it pleased her. He had fitted up the paternal mansion in princely style. Beautiful gardens were in progress. Indeed, there was every thing one could imagine in attempting to build a fairy castle. On entering this splendid mansion, Alexa was installed its adored mistress by her noble husband, with an affectionate grace which was inimitable, and peculiarly his own.  &#xD;<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7378-00000159"/> 312      WAIT AND SEE. The guests were welcomed with proportionate tenderness and warmth. "' How beautiful!" cried Alexa; her tender, love-lit eyes bathed in tears of joy. "My dear, tried, and true friends," said she, " had I ten thousand hearts, they would all give you ten thousand welcomes. I can find no words to express my fervent, grateful thanks, first to the Giver, and next to yourselves, every one. Oh, I am blest!" "Sister, beloved sister!" said the Rev. Mr. Atherton, tenderly embracing her. Edward thought of his brother's prophecy when he had communicated his heart's secret to him, and could almost have worshipped him. Every one present followed the pastor's example, and embraced her. When it came to Lizzie's turn, she said, "Dear Mrs. Atherton, will you let a little girl give you kisses now, when you can have them so plentifully from all the gentlemen and ladies, and don't have to stoop down either?" "Come to my arms, you precious darling!" cried Alexa, fondly embracing her. After a short pause, said the pastor, '"Will   WAIT AND SEE.      313 it be agreeable to yot, dear brother and sister, to Brother and Sister Huntley, and to all present, to unite with me in the midst of all this happy enjoyment, and kneel before the great Giver, to render him our grateful homage for the past, and to entreat a continu- ance of his protecting care and mercy?" "Certainly, certainly, it will: many thanks to our dear and reverend brother for reminding us of a duty which we in our selfish enjoyment had well - nigh. forgotten," replied -those to whom the question was addressed. They all kneeled before the Most High, and a fervent petition was laid before the eternal throne, by the Rev. Mr. Atherton, "in behalf of all present, and all God's creatures throughout the immensity of space; and especially for the bridal pair, who had so recently plighted hands; that they might not forget in their present prosperity what they had so humbly remembered in their day of trial and adversity; that their now happy home might be dedicated to the Great Jehovah; that it might continue to be happy." In this 27  &#xD;<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7378-00000160"/> 314      WAIT AND SEE. heartfelt devotion, that good man poured out his inspired soul before the Most High. His prayer was deeply felt by every one present, and a fervent "Amen!" was the response from every heart. When the deep solemnity inspired by the prayer had gradually subsided into cheerful- ness, it was proposed by Edward to make. the tour of the- rooms, which were perfectly splendid. Nothing seemed wanting. Genuine taste was displayed in all the appointments throughout the mansion, and every thing showed that convenience had been consulted in all. We cannot go into detail, not being good at description: besides, such matters have been described so often, that we could give nothing but a fac-simile of many others. On their return to the drawing-room, re- freshments were served; but a genuine New- England supper was being prepared in the kitchen. Fred and Fanny had a rich time in racing over the premises, swinging and high- flying in great glee. Arielle was very cheerful, but missed something: there seemed to her   WAIT AND SEE.      315 a blank; but she dared not ask even her own heart what caused it. Lizzie marched from room to room, expecting and receiving homage from every one she met. After supper, the servants were presented to their new mistress. She had a smile and a kind word for each of them, which won their hearts on the instant; and her subsequent kindness to them held the hearts she had won. The Rev. Mr. Atherton and his family were obliged to return the next day, as they had left poor old Juba, who was very feeble,- at Mr. Huntley's, in Dinah's care; he being too unwell to be taken with them %t0Philadelphia. They had taken him to Boston to see "Massa Ed'ard married," and the ride had overtaxed his waning strength. "I willin' to die now, now Massa Edward got he wish, an' he so happy," said the poor, faithful old African. Both families now returned to Boston. On account of Juba's illness, their foreign tour had been postponed, as they could not take  &#xD;<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7378-00000161"/> 316      WAIT AND SEE. him with them when he was so ill: nor could they think of leaving the poor old creature behind, especially as it was pleasure they were going to seek; and hearts like theirs could find little pleasure after deserting a faithful servant, and leaving him to die, per- haps alone. No: nothing would have tempted them to forsake him at such a time. It was therefore decided by them all to delay the foreign tour until Theodore had graduated at college, and could make one of the party.   317 CHAPTER   XLVII. MRS. RUSSELL'S GRAND PARTY. - RIVALRY AMONG THE BELLES AND SPINSTERS. - THE THRILLING SONG.--THE JOYFUL RECOGNITION.- THE NEWLY FOUND PARENTS. SHORTLY after the departure of their friends, Edward and Alexa received a card of invitation to attend a party given by a very aristocratic family in honor of Lord Moreton and' his niece. (She was everywhere styled his niece, although no one had ever been told by either of them that she bore that relation to him.) They decided at once to attend it. Although they had agreed to live in a retired way, and to mix with the great world as little as possible, yet they were desirous of becoming acquainted with persons in whom they felt so deep an interest, on account of having exchanged the portraits with them, and believing there was more respecting the originals of those por- traits than had yet come to the surface. 27*  &#xD;<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7378-00000162"/> 318      WAIT AND SEE. They wisely forebore to speak of it, as they could prove nothing; but resolved, if possible, to have this great mystery, which had so per- plexed them, explained, whenever they could obtain an interview with Lord Moreton. The evening of the party arrived; and Mrs. Russell's drawing-rooms were filled with the beautiful, the wealthy, and the fashionable  of that great city. Edward and his lovely bride attracted much attention and courtesy from all present. It is true, the disappointed mammas and daughters, who had once looked forward to Atherton as a desirable match, curled their pretty lips and tossed their lovely heads, and simpered, when introduced to Mrs. Edward Atherton. Her appearance was so faultless, that there could be no just criticisms but in her favor. But one young lady, among the many who had aspired to the hand of Edward, whispered be- hind her fan, "Ma, don't you think she will be a good mother to him?" "Yes, darling, if old age can do it," replied ma with a malicious sneer.   WAIT AND SEE.      319 There were many such sneers and insinua- tions that evening among the envious; but, when Lord Moreton and niece were announced, there was a breathless silence, and the eyes of every one present were directed to the English nobleman and his lovely niece. It was also confidently whispered, that he was unmarried. This rendered him an object of still deeper interest, if possible. In short, he was com- pletely worshipped. Mrs. Atherton had composed a little touch- -ing poem; intending, if urged to sing and play, to sing it to a plaintive air of her own. Soon after the entrance of the English visit- ors, they were introduced to Mr. and Mrs. Edward Atherton.  -When Alexa touok the proffered hand of the niece, her own trembled so violently, that she could scarcely clasp it. Effie looked into her face, and saw that she was pale as marble. At this her own face turned deathly pale, and a deep, hopeful light flashed from her beaming eyes. Their hands remained clasped, and their eyes spell-bound  &#xD;<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC7378-00000163"/> 320      WAIT AND SEE. on each other, until they both became aware that they were attracting general observation; when they separated. Alexa took her husband's arm, and whis- pered him to take her into the air; that she felt ill. "What is it, dearest? What shall I bring you ." "Nothing: I shall soon recover. Edward, it is she! I cannot be mistaken. I have mistrusted it ever since I saw her likeness!" Here a flood of tears relieved her throbbing heart. "Bless and thank the Lord!" cried he, nearly as much agitated as herself. "I will fathom this mystery before I part from Lord Moreton this night. There, love: now try to feel composed. Let me go for something to restore you, dearest." "By no means, dear Eddy: I am too happy to require it. Let us return to the company before our absence is observed." They entered the drawing-room, with no traces of excitement visible on their faces.   WAIT AND SEE.      321 Soon after, refreshments were served; then music was called for by nearly all the ladies who had musical prodigies for daughters, that, if possible, his unmarried, wealthy lordship might be charmed. Several new and fashionable airs had been played by the musical divinities of the evening; when Moreton, after bestowing his commenda- tions on the different performers, with a most gallant air approached Mrs. Atherton, and, bowing, requested the pleasure of leading her to the instrument. She stammered something about being too indifferent a performer to make the attempt, especially after such a combination of sweet sounds as they had been hearing; but his lordship besought her to so far indulge him as to comply with this one request. "I will," said she, brightening, " if you will grant the first request I shall make of your lordship." "On my honor, fair lady, i will,- even to half my kingdom, supposing I had one," said -he gayly, and conducted her to the piano.  &#xD;<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC7378-00000164"/> 322      WAIT AND SEE. While passing her fair fingers over the keys, she had an inspired look which was per- fectly celestial. Every eye in the room was fixed on her in admiration; for her whole form and face seemed suddenly endowed with supernatural grace and beauty.   She com- menced'the little stanzas, the words and air of which were purely original. They began as follows:  "Oh! give me back the sweet young dove Torn from its downy nest." There were but four stanzas; which we must leave the reader to imagine, as we do not recol- lect them. Suffice it to say, that, before the piece was half performed, there was scarcely a dry eye in the room. Effie seemed perfectly fascinated. She gradually neared the per- former, as did her guardian, completely un- mindful of any thing but the thrilling words of the stanzas. 'When it was finished, Effie looked for a moment searchingly into Mrs. Atherton's face, then shrieked the word "Mo- ther!" and fell fainting on her first pillow.   WAIT AND SEE.      323 The gasping mother uttered," My child!" and was carried senseless from the room, to- gether with Effie, still clasped to the maternal breast. This scene caused great alarm and confusion throughout the hitherto gay party. Edward Atherton gave a brief explanation of the mu- tual recognition and its consequences, and begged to be excused for the remainder of the evening. As he passed out of the room, Moreton took his hand, saying, ' With your permission, dear sir, I will retire with you to a private room!; for probably we both feel too deep an interest in what has just transpired to wish to re- main." "Certainly," replied Edward. Moreton begged the ladies and gentlemen to excuse him, as it was a matter of the ut- most importance that required his attention. He then made his adieu, entreating that it might not disturb the company, or interfere with their enjbyment for the remainder of the evening.  &#xD;<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC7378-00000165"/> 324      WAIT AND SEE. Moreton and Edward then left the drawing- room arm in arm, and traversed the portico for some time in silence. There seemed to be a tacit understanding between them, and both seemed to comprehend the whole. At length, they so far overcame their embarrassment as to converse on common topics, - such as the beauty of the evening, the brilliancy of the party, &amp;c. "But," said Atherton, "I suppose you are used to so much more splendor in England, that such as we have here must appear to your lordship as a very light affair." "By no means, my dear sir. I trust that the events of this evening will be very impor- tant to our present and future happiness," replied. Moreton. They were now both summoned to the room where the mother and daughter stood, still locked in each other's arms, surrounded by ladies, who were weeping with sympathetic emotions and congratulating by turns. When the two gentlemen entered the room, Mrs. Atherton stepped gracefully forward and   WAIT AND SEE.      325 placed the hand of Effie into that of Atherton, saying, "C My husband, my daughter!"She then took the proffered hand of Moreton, and fer- vently pressed it, saying, "Dear, generous Lord Moreton, you have been God's angel of mercy to my precious darling! What can I say, what can I do, to express my feelings?. Ac- cept "--  Here tears of joy, love, and gra- titude, prevented further utterance. "You rate me too highly, dear lady," replied Moreton, deeply affected; and, touch- ing her fair hand with his lips, he led her to a seat. Edward tenderly embraced his lovely step- daughter; and, placing her by the side of her mother, he seated himself beside her. "I do not call for half your kingdom, my lord, as a promised boon; but I do ask for the whole of your leisure during your stay in this city," said Mrs. Atherton. "Yes," said her husband. "Pray, return with us this evening, and give us all the time that you can possibly spare from higher enjoy- ments." 28  &#xD;<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC7378-00000166"/> 326      WAIT AND SEE. "Thank you: none could be higher, and nothing could give me greater pleasure. And I think my niece will coincide," replied More- ton, smiling; " for I already begin to feel the truth of the remark, that- 'Blessings brighten as they take their flight.' " They then sent for Mrs. Russell (for the ladies had the delicacy to retire, and leave the parties immediately concerned together), and begged her to excuse them for creating a scene at her party. "Certainly, my beloveds: it requires no apology. I should delight to witness, every day, a scene productive of so much happiness," replied Mrs. Russell, smiling sweetly on the group before her. The carriages being ready, Lord Moreton sent his own back to the hotel, and rode home with Effie and her newly found parents. That evening, they all sat until a very late hour, engaged in deeply interesting conversation. Every thing respecting their daughter was fully explained by Moreton to their entire satisfaction.   WAIT AND SEE.     327 Alexa and her husband read Seymour's packet with convulsive shuddering. When they had finished reading it and the will, they were greatly astonished that he had proved his penitence by endowing Effie with an honest inheritance; and they fully approved of all the managements of her guardian. The guardianship of her property was not transferable; but Moreton empowered Ather- ton to act as her guardian on his own respon- sibility. The parents of Effie viewed Moreton as her preserver, and as an angel of mercy to them all. They could not think of changing her name from one so dear to them as that of "Sinclair," and only regretted that her name could not be "Henry" also. "We might insert the name of Henrietta," said her mother,  "Effie Henrietta Sin- clair." "Would you like to be so named, daugh- ter?" asked Mr. Atherton. "Very much," said she, looking affection- ately at Moreton.  &#xD;<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC7378-00000167"/> 328      WAIT AND SEE. "We will so name her, then," said her mother, " if it meets the approbation of her -her more than benefactor." "If you refer to me, dearest lady, it will be very gratifying both to my vanity and to my heart," replied Moreton with a sigh. Effie now arose and exchanged the good- night kiss with her "dear guardy" and her pa- rents, and was conducted by her mother to her sleeping-room. After caressing her, and shed- ding tears of joy on her sweet face, that tender, Christian mother kneeled before Jehovah, and poured out her joyful, grateful homage in prayer; then, again fondly embracing her -darling, bade her "Good-night!" and descend- ed to the parlor. Moreton was then conducted by Mr. Atherton to his apartment. It being a very late hour, the servants had leave to retire an hour or two before.   329 CHAPTER   XLVIII. A TRUE, TENDER ATTACHMENT.- THE PRESENT. - THE SAD FAREWELL. THE next morning, after breakfast, Moreton said that his mission to America was now ful- filled; that affairs relative, to his present posi- tion in England would render it imperatively necessary for him to return as soon as possible; that he must embark as soon as a suitable berth could be engaged; that he must leave them on that day, " and Heaven knows with what reluctance," said he tenderly. Effie had left the room, weeping bitterly at the idea of being separated, perhaps for ever, from her " dear guardy." Edward and Alexa were both much-saddened at the announcement of Moreton's departure; but, as he had said it was an imperative neces- sity, they felt obliged to submit, saying, "Must it be so?" 28*  &#xD;<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC7378-00000168"/> 330     WAIT AND SEE. "How it will neutralize the happiness of finding our own beloved, if we must be sepa- rated from one, who, under heaven, has been her guardian angel!" said Alexa, much af- fected. "We cannot remain long without you, dear Moreton," said Edward. "Will you not give us, as a consolation, your promise to honor us with a longer visit at no far-distant day?" "Depend on that, dear Atherton, if I live," said he, taking a hand of each in both of his own. I had thought that I possessed more fortitude, more manhood, than to betray to you the pang that now rends my heart. Yes, dear lady: we were speaking of half the king- dom; but I have given more. I never knew until now the depth and strength of my affec- tion for that precious child. I had never analyzed my feelings, - never was aware that I felt other than a paternal love; but, ah! I find, in leaving her, that I leave my heart's most cherished treasure." "I feel greatly surprised," said Edward. "This paternal and fraternal affection will   WAIT AND SEE.      331 sometimes forge a chain that cannot be severed, but holds for life. I speak this from experi- ence, dear Moreton." "What can we do to serve you, our dear- est earthly benefactor?" asked Alexa with tears. "Nothing, at present: we must wait for the hand of Divine Providence to direct. She is yet too young to know that I am more than. 'guardy' to her. I am /her senior by many years, and perhaps she may never think of me in any other light than she has ever done: time alone will decide that. But, should her heart feel no other preference when she has completed her eighteenth year, have I your united permission to then offer her my heart, hand, and all that it is mine to offer?" They each took a hand of his, and both said that they could not aspire to higher honor or greater happiness on earth for their dar- ling.  Moreton was greatly rejoiced at their words, but enjoined them not to inform her of this communication at present, or to ever persuade  &#xD;<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC7378-00000169"/> 332      WAIT AND SEE. her, but to let it be a voluntary affection and acceptance if any thing. That point settled, and the confidential dis- course ended, BMoreton said that he must now take his leave. "Let me once more see the darling of my soul," said he; " but in your presence, if you please." Effic entered the room, pale with sorrow. "My dear baby," said her mother, " cheer up. Our kind friend is not going to desert us en- tirely, but has engaged to write to us, and to visit us before long." At this intelligence, Effie brightened up, and, smiling through her tears, exclaimed, "Thank Heaven!" Morcton then approached her with a splen- did box in his hand, saying, "Here, Effie, is a present for the new name of'!Henrietta' which you have consented to receive. And, Effie, do you prefer the name of ' Sinclair' to' that of your father?" I do prefer it to any name under heaven," replied she, fondly clasping her hands on his shoulder.   WAIT AND SEE.      333 "Accept this box, then: it is not to be opened until one week from to-day. I can trust you, dear. Here is the key." He then shook the hand of Atherton with a warm pressure, raised the hand of Alexa to his lips, and said, "Effie, my dove, shall we exchange the farewell kiss?" The loving child threw her arms about his neck, and sobbed convulsively on his bosom. Moreton felt that his firmness was deserting him; 'and, gently disengaging himself from her locked embrace, he sadly touched his lips to her fair forehead, and in a breath was gone. He proceeded directly to Boston, and had a copy in miniature, on ivory, taken from the full-length portrait of Effie. This miniature he took with him. He then proceeded to New York, and em- barked directly for England, where he arrived safely. ,   &#xD;<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC7378-00000170"/> 334 CHAPTER   XLIX. VISITORS. - THE MYSTERIOUS BOX. -TIE PORTRAIT. THE SURPRISE.--THE MALE FLIRT. - THE RIVAL BEAUTIES. AT the house of Edward Atherton, Esq., callers were constantly announced with their smiles and congratulations. That little family were as happy as could be while feeling so deeply the absence of their beloved Moreton. We shrewdly suspect that not a few of the single ladies had an under-current of motive in calling; viz., to hear more about the Eng- lish lord, and to know what had become of him, as he had not called on them since the party, although many of them had sat in full dress, at all fashionable hours, ever since, but to no purpose. Edward had heard nothing from his bro- ther's family or from the Huntleys since their departure; and, wishing to give them a hap- py surprise, they set out for Boston.   WAIT AND SEE.      335 Effie had counted the tedious days it took to fill that interminable week that must pass be- fore she could take a peep inside of the box presented by Moreton; but, possessed as she was with- the spirit of her grandmother Eve, she had honor enough to restrain her curiosity. On the last day of that long week, in the morning, she had often looked at her watch to see if it was eleven o'clock; for at that hour she could honorably open the box. The long-waited-for moment came at last; and, in the presence of both parents, she turned the key of gold, and opened it. With what rapturous delight did she discover that it contained a perfect miniature likeness of her "dear guardy," set round with pure diamonds, with the Moreton coat-of-arms engraved on the back, headed with the word "Remember"! Below the device was engraved, "I wear yours." The box also contained a splendid diamond ring of great value. Effie was in perfect ecstasies for a long time, but shed tears of tender sorrow when she gazed on that lifelike portrait.  &#xD;<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC7378-00000171"/> 336      WAIT AND SEE. Effie was not to be introduced in her own character when they should arrive at Mr. Huntley's, but as a relative of Alexa, who was to spend a few weeks with them. The Rev. Mr. Atherton and family were still at Mr. Huntley's; for poor old Juba was very low, and too weak to be carried home. They were all greatly rejoiced to see their brother and sister so much sooner than they could reasonably have expected; but, not in the least supecting the real cause, attributed it to Edward's well-known affection for Juba. After dinner, Edward asked if they could trace any resemblance between Miss Sinclair and his wife. At this, every eye was turned to the object of his remark. Effie blushed deeply at meeting the admiring glances direct- ed to her face. Frederic's eyes, in particular, were riveted on her with quite as piercing a gaze as was consistent with a well-bred gentle- man. "I do!" "I do!" was the general response. Edward then led her forward, saying, "Dearest friends, allow me to introduce to   WAIT AND SEE.     337 you Effie Henrietta Sinclair, the daughter of our beloved Ally." The commotion that ensued would be impos- sible to describe. She was tenderly embraced with tears of joy and congratulation, except by Lizzie, who stood aloof, and looked on her beauty with a tart expression of countenance; fearing a rival, no doubt. They could scarcely realize that this was the once-lost child of Wil- liam and Alexa Dorset. Fanny looked at her with a fond but pensive smile: for she judged rightly that Fred would be deeply in love with her, as he always was with a new beauty; " and how much more," thought she, "with one of such matchless loveliness!" 29  &#xD;<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC7378-00000172"/> 338 CHAPTER   L. DEATH AND BURIAL OF JULIA. - THEODORE ATHERTON.- DEPARTURE OF REV. MR. ATHERTON. ON the third day after their arrival, Juba died. The two brothers were real mourners; for they both loved him, and so did they all. One thing could be said of this good old African, that could not of many of his proud superiors who had stepped down the dark valley before him, - "He lived beloved, and died lamented." Mr. and Mrs. Huntley begged them to have the funeral at their house, and to bury him in their lot in the churchyard: "For," said Mrs. Huntley, " he will rise our equal in wealth, in color, and perhaps our superior in honor; for he has better improved his one simple talent than we our higher and richer gifts."   WAIT AND SEE.     339 "Amen!" was the solemn response. The proposal of all remaining together was decided on, and the funeral solemnities took place from the Huntley mansion. The Ather- ton families were prevailed on to remain until Theodore came, who was expected in a day or two. While they were in Boston, Edward received a letter from Philadelphia, with one enclosed for his reverend brother, inviting him to supply the vacant pulpit in a church of his own order; and it was confidently expected that he would receive a unanimous call to settle over that church. They hoped he would find it possible to comply, and that he would be able to be with them on the first sabbath after the ensuing one; as that would be their time of sacrament, and he would be preferred to administer that ordi- nance. "Just as I would have it!" said Edward. "Why, brother, how rejoiced I am at the bare prospect of having you locate in our own beloved city!" "Do not anticipate too far, my dear boy,  &#xD;<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC7378-00000173"/> 340     WAIT AND SEE. lest you should be disappointed," quietly re- plied the parson. At the expected time, Theodore arrived for his vacation, being apprised by letter where to find his parents; and, being nothing loath, he went directly to Mr. Huntley's. After he had been duly greeted and caressed, his father took him aside, and informed him of his being invited to preach at Philadelphia. Said he, "Do you feel, my son, as if you could supply my pulpit at Ryefield during your vacation t " "Really, dear father, I am willing to try to do any thing that you suggest; but I fear that it will be very poorly supplied." "You are willing to try, then?" "Certainly; but with fear and trembling," replied Theodore. "That is right, my dear boy. I am rejoiced that you distrust your own abilities: it gives me stronger hopes of your success." The Rev. Mr. Atherton set out the next day, accompanied by his brother Edward and   WAIT AND SEE.     341 family, for his new appointment; having informed them by letter that he might be expected at the time specified. 29*  &#xD;<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC7378-00000174"/> 342 CHAPTER   LI. THE PREACHNG OF THEODORE. - CHURCH -IMEETING IN RYEFIELD. - MORETON ANNOUNCES HS INTENDED MAR- RIAGE. - GRIEF OF A TRUE HEART. ON the following Saturday, Theodore set out for his appointment at Ryefield. He invited Alfred to accompany him on horseback, as the weather was pleasant; but besought his other friends not to think of going to hear him: "For, if one of you were present, I could not even begin. I must give Darley an interesting book to bribe him to keep out of my way," said he gayly. The Ryefield society were perfectly astound- ed, on entering the meeting-house, to see Theodore Atherton in his father's pulpit, and to hear him preach an excellent sermon. He was requested to preach for them again. He modestly replied, "I will try." At the close of his vacation, and before   WAIT AND SEE.      343 he departed for his last term at college, he had, with the sanction and approval of her parents, sought his future destiny at the hands of Arielle; which was not a very stern one, as the reader may imagine. The Rev. Mr. Atherton, having received a special call to settle in Philadelphia, returned to Ryefield, and called a meeting of the church and society, asking them to release him, as it was his native city where he was called to preach; moreover, that he expected to make a foreign tour at no distant time, and would be obliged to leave them then. They were very loath to spare him: but, as it seemed to be the wish of their beloved pastor, they felt it their duty to release him; which they did with much regret.  The Huntleys accompanied them to their new abode, and staid until they were pleasantly settled. Before leaving, Mr. Huntley presented Mr. Atherton with a splendid set of books for his library, containing the best ancient and modern authors. To Mrs. Atherton he gave. a service of silver, of the most exquisite workmanship.  &#xD;<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC7378-00000175"/> 344     WAIT AND SEE. To Fanny he gave a costly rosewood piano; and a sealed paper for Theodore, to be de- livered to him on the day that he graduated from college. They then departed, after spending a day at Edward's. One morning, a servant brought his master a letter directed to him, with "Eng." on the post-mark, and sealed with the Moreton coat- of-arms. "A letter from Moreton, as I live!" ex- claimed Edward. "Here, Ally: come hither, love. See what a treasure! Where is our darling . " "She is out on a shopping expedition," said Mrs. Atherton, smiling. "But the letter is ad- dressed to you: we need not wait her return." "True," said he, and broke the seal, and read. Moreton had safely arrived; was in perfect health; had attended to his parlia- mentary duties; and had located himself in London, at the West End. "As I think of getting married before long, I thought that my lady-love might prefer a residence in London."   WAIT AND SEE.      345 This was all perfectly understood by the two; but he only sent his love to Effie in a right fatherly way. When she returned and had read the letter, the rapture that she had expressed on first seeing the well-known coat of arms vanished, and she became pale and pensive. "Why is my sweet dove sad " inquired her mother as soon as they were alone. "It is because my still dear ' guardy' seems to be done with me," said she very innocently. "When he is married, he will not love me any more." Her mother could scarce suppress a smile as she said, "Perhaps he will, my dear." Thus time passed rapidly for more than a year, and Effie was still progressing in the higher branches of polite literature and ac- complishment.  &#xD;<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC7378-00000176"/> 346 CHAPTER   LII. FRED HUNTLEY'S WIT, BEAUTY, AND GRACE. - ALFRED DARLEY; A NOBLE FELLOW. - MR. HUNTLEY'S WILL. FREDERIC HUNTLEY'S brilliant wit, beauty, wealth, and gracefulness had no attractions for Effie. For this her mother was truly thankful; for, had she no other reasons, she well knew that he would never be capable of a true, steady attachment. Fred was very much attached to Alfred Darley, and made him the repository of his choicest secrets. "Darley," said he one day, "why do you not pay your addresses to some lady? You are nearly as old as myself, and I have been flirting for years." "That's a fact, Huntley." "Yes, and might be foolish enough to wed; but the deuse of it is, among so many beauties, one is often puzzled to make a selec-   WAIT AND SEE.      347 tion. There is Fanny Atherton, -a superb creature: I did formerly think of her, but now have about made up my mind to select Effie H. Sinclair;- for she is new. I have known Fanny so long, that it would seem like marrying one's sister, you know." Alfred said, "Yes," without knowing what he said. The truth is, Alfred loved the beauti- ful Fanny himself, and had for a long time; but he always thought it a hopeless passion, and had wisely locked it in his own breast. But to see her the wife of another, he felt, would be the crowning touch of his despair. Alfred had be3n steadily advancing in the mercantile profess'on, to the entire satisfaction  and approval of Mr. Huntley, who had pro- moted him to the office of head clerk in the establishment, and had raised his salary to fifteen hundred dollars a year. Mr. Huntley had often been heard to say, that there was not as more deserving, worthy young man in the city. Alfred was a noble, interesting young man, and very highly esteemed by every one. lie  &#xD;<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC7378-00000177"/> 348     WAIT AND SEE. sustained an unblemished reputation, and bade fair to become one of the most enterprising merchants of the city. We should suppose that any sensible young lady would have pre- ferred him to Frederic Huntley as a husband; but Huntley's father was a very wealthy city merchant, and Alfred's father was nobody but Uncle Ben. Mr. Huntley's health had become rather in- firm; and his physician had told him candidly, that, from the nature of his disease, he was likely to die suddenly when his time did come. Knowing the general uncertainty of life, Mr. Huntley had his will made in writing; had signed and sealed it, and put it among his choice papers. All this was unknown to his family; he not wishing to distress them with fearful apprehensions. One object in his mak- ing his will was, that he felt sure that his son would be a spendthrift; and, to prevent his ever being reduced to poverty, he gave the bulk of his vast wealth to his wife, that she might control that which otherwise would have been bequeathed to his son. To Arielle he gave a t   WAIT AND SEE.      349 hundred thousand. The sealed paper, left as a present for Theodore, contained a check for fifty thousand more; that was his own, exclu- sively: for he wished to see them united as soon as Theodore had graduated, and wished to remove what he foresaw would be the only barrier. To Alfred Darley he gave fifty thou- sand, in the will. To Lizzie Huntley he gave thirty thousand, thinking that was better for her than more, as he felt pretty well assured that she would never apply any of it to bene- volent purposes; and, besides, his wife would have sufficient wealth to supply any lack whatever with any of them. 30  &#xD;<pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC7378-00000178"/> 350 CHAPTER LIII. MARRIAGE OF THEODORE AND ARIELLE.-ENGAGEMENT OF ALFRED AND FANNY. -FRED AND LIZZIE.-- THE HEIR. THEODORE ATHERTON   had  graduated with much honor to himself, and had taken "orders;" and it was expected that he would locate in Boston. He and Arielle were to be married on the first day of May ensuing. Rolling time soon brought that welcome day. The happy pair now sealed their vows at the hymeneal altar in the presence of the two Atherton families and the Huntley family only. Every thing passed off in a quiet way, as did their courtship: and their love, though deep and pure, was quiet, like deep waters, that flow gently and noiselessly; a proof that the " course of true love " can run smoothly. The bridal party - consisting of the happy pair, Fanny, Alfred, Frederic, and Lizzie--   WAIT AND SEE.      351 made an excursion to Saratoga and several other beautiful watering-places, and were ab- sent on their tour for a month or two. Fanny, on this occasion, showed a decided preference for the companionship and attentions of Al- fred; feeling determined that that male-flirt, Fred Huntley, should trifle with her feelings no longer. She had fancied him, it is true; but had never loved him with that devoted, yielding love that will suffer itself to be trampled on by its object. Her woman's dignity, pride, and delicacy all came to her assistance; and she was able to distance him without any pang or heart- struggle. This gave happy Fred no manner of uneasiness; for Effie still was -his last favorite, though not present (she had pre- ferred to remain with her parents). Alfred made so good improvement of his time and opportunity while on this tour, that he returned the affianced husband of Fanny Atherton. Her brother took the responsibility of her parents' consent being as cheerfully given as his own.  Arielle gave her consent, but said she regretted not being able to claim  &#xD;<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC7378-00000179"/> 352      WAIT AND SEE. her by a double tie as sister; that she congra- tulated her on having gained the affections of the best young man within her knowledge, with one exception. This she said with a sweet smile, and a significant glance towards Theodore, who sprang to her side, expressing his gratitude for the compliment in the usual form on such occasions. At this engagement, Lizzie was much grati- fied; as she had designed, whenever she be- came weary of coquetry and of jilting lovers, to become the wife of Fred; not in the least doubting her power to bring that project to maturity, if Fanny was only out of the way. "How fortunate!" thought she. "Iy bro- ther Alfred deserves to be canonized as the highest saint in the calendar for rendering me such a service." And she put on all her airs and graces.  Beautiful she certainly was; which rendered her nearly irresistible.

ALFRED DARLEY. - ADVICE O0 MR. HUNTLEY. - SICKNESS, DEATH, AND BURIAL OF EZRA DARLEY. MR. HUNTLEY now retired from business, after arranging his affairs and setting Alfred up for himself, or rather putting the business into his own hands, -giving him the whole profits; which he did not fail to improve to the best advantage: and, within one year, there was not a more respected, honorable, rising young man in the city of Boston than Alfred Dar- ley. He now consulted his benefactor, Mr. Hunt- ley, and confided to him his attachment to the lovely Fanny; asking his consent to their immediate union. "Ah! what does Fred say to all this?. I thought that he was beating that bush," said Mr. Huntley with a shrewd smile. "He had told me, sir, that Effie was his   WAIT AND SEE.      355 elect, before I ever sought, or said the first fond word to, Fanny." "The fickle rascal!" said Mr. Huntley with great good-humor. "Well, Darley, such ho- nor and fidelity as yours shall be rewarded." "Oh! pray do not mention it, sir. What a load of obligations your benevolence has laid me under, not only to myself, but to all my relatives! What shall I sayt." cried Al- fred, wringing the hand of his benefactor, while tears dimmed the lustre of his speaking eyes. "Just say nothing: let me do the talking. These half-married fellows are non compos mentis generally, the best of them, I find," said Mr. Huntley with a gay smile. "But to be serious, Alfred: I advise you to have the mar- riage solemnized as soon as possible. These long engagements are never desirable, where there is no obstacle. Suppose Iattend to your mercantile affairs while you just run over to Philadelphia. And do your best, my dear boy, to bring home the fair, beautiful Fanny as Mrs. Alfred Darley: will you?"  &#xD;<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC7378-00000181"/> 356     WAIT AND SEE. "Ten thousand thanks, my dear, generous friend! How gratefully shall I avail myself of your kindness! Would it be better to write in advance of going?" "Well thought of, Darley. It would, and they will then be expecting you. You may lay all the blame of the hurrying at my door." "Thank you, dear sir, for shielding me from harm," said Alfred with a joyous laugh; and he commenced preparations for his jour- ney, after having despatched a letter to his elect. Just as he was setting out on his journey, he received the news that his brother Ezra was dangerously ill; and he immediately turned his course. That he felt severely dis- appointed, cannot be denied; but "Duty be- fore inclination" had ever been- his motto. He had never enjoyed Ezra as a brother, he was so ungentle and irritable; but, notwith- standing, he had always endeavored to act a brother's part towards the unlovable youth. He found him very low of a fever, which   WAIT AND SEE.      357 terminated his unhappy life on the second day after Alfred's arrival. The poor old parents would now be left very desolate; for Anna was to be married'in a few months to a young farmer of Ryefield, and go out West to settle, and live in a log- house while her husband cleared a tract of land, and made it into a farm. Alfred remained until after the funeral, and sent to Boston for his sister. Lizzie was very loath to go; but as Mrs. Huntley urged her, and insisted on her going, - "Well," said she, I will go to please you, mamma, if you will not insist on my wearing black after I return. I can't endure black, it is so unbecoming!" Mrs. Huntley sighed at her heartlessness, and replied, "I shall not oblige you to wear what you dislike, Lizzie; but I must insist on your going to your brother's funeral, on your parents' account and Alfred's, if not on your own." She did go; 4but displayed so much hauteur, that she was any thing but a comfort to any one.  &#xD;<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC7378-00000182"/> 358     WAIT AND SEE. After their return to Boston, Alfred wrote to Fanny again, informing her of his brother's death, and that he probably should be there in two months from date; that he hoped she would then consent to return with him as his beloved wife. In the mean time, he had purchased and furnished a neat, convenient house near his business establishment; had been to see his parents, and see that they lacked nothing, in a pecuniary sense, to make them comfortable; and gave them the means to continue so, as far as money would do it. Ezra had never been a comfort to them; and, of late, had been very idle, and unsteady in his habits. His loss was not so severely felt as it otherwise would have been; but they mourned that he had died apparently impenitent. He went to a just and merciful God; and there we leave him, as we must the greatest and best of the human family.   359- CHAPTER LV. MARRIAGE OF ALFRED DARLEY AND FANNY ATHERTON. - THEODORE AND ARIELT F. - THE UNGRATEFUL CHLD. - THE GOOD DAUGHTER-IN-LAW. AT the appointed time, Alfred arrived in Philadelphia, where he was received with a most cordial welcome by his future parents; for, in truth, they preferred him to Frederic for a son-in-law, notwithstanding their high esteem for the Huntley Family generally. Fanny received him  with a fond, blushing look. There was but little ceremony, as the most important part of the marriage - the joining of hearts - was already performed. A few words from her reverend father, with no witnesses but her uncle's family and their own household, made them one for life. For their bridal tour, they returned to their own happy home in    Boston, and invited *  &#xD;<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC7378-00000183"/> 360     WAIT AND SEE. their family friends, but no other at that time; and the whole affair passed off in a very quiet way. They were certainly very happy; but sister Lizzie thought they manifested " no more am- bition than a couple of kittens, in the way of making an appearance." Theodore was now settled in Boston, where he gave such entire satisfaction, and was so beloved by his congregation, that there was great danger of his being worshipped instead of the Lord. And Arielle - she was almost adored, and looked up to as a pattern for all her sex. How far her perfections were magnified by being seen through her abundant wealth, we cannot pretend to say; but this we confidently say, she was one of the most amiable, intellectual women in that city or any other. They still resided at the Huntley mansion, from which they could not be spared to reside elsewhere. Alfred and Fanny fre- quently joined the happy family circle; and, if ever there was complete enjoyment on earth, it was then and there.   WAIT AND SEE.     361 When Fanny went with her husband to visit his parents,- which she considered a privilege as well as a duty, - she was the bearer of many nice presents from her mother and her aunt Atherton. Mrs. Huntley sent the heavy presents in Alfred's care. Mr. Huntley sent to Anna a wedding present of two hundred dollars, "for pocket-money," as he said; and Alfred added a hundred more. Fanny was also the bearer of a box from Mrs. Edward Atherton, containing valuable presents for every one of the benevolent per- sons who had in any way assisted or befriended her in the time of her adversity. Uncle Ben and Aunt Nabby were delighted with their new daughter, as well they might be; and how rejoiced they were to hear that "Miss Dorset," as they still persisted in calling her, had found her lost child! They both inquired for Lizzie; asking with sorrowful voices, "Why did she not come?" Fanny could not grieve the poor old parents by informing them that she would not come; that she had resisted all their efforts to prevail 31  &#xD;<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC7378-00000184"/> 362     WAIT AND SEE. on her to come with them; and she replied, that Lizzie was young and thoughtless, and had so many engagements, that it was not con- venient for her to come until they came again: "Which will be before long; for," said Fanny, "we intend to visit you often. I am your daughter now, and hope you will ever find me an affectionate one." Thus did this dovelike creature endeavor to soothe and comfort that aged pair under the unfeeling, cruel neglect of their almost-wor- shipped child.   363 CHAPTER LVI. DEPARTURE OF LORD MORETON FOR NEW YORK. THE "FAIR AMERICAN." - MOTHER AND DAUGlTrtK. EFFIE had now nearly completed her eigh- teenth year; and, according to his letters, Lord Moreton was daily expected.   Her parents had informed him by letter that they felt entirely confident that Effie had no other preference than her still dear " guardy." This assurance set all his doubts at rest, and rendered him the happiest of men,' as he thought, no doubt; and he immediately made preparations for his departure to America, His splendid residence was already prepared with every thing grand, beautiful, and de- lightful. He fitted out a vessel of his own in princely style: nothing of elegance or comfort was lacking. Her name was the "Fair American."  &#xD;<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC7378-00000185"/> 364     WAIT AND SEE. When all was ready, he entered the stateroom, and on his bended knees, committing the ves- sel, and all on board, and all that was his, to God, entreated almighty protection, and a blessing on his present enterprise. He then gave orders to put the vessel under way. Effie had been informed by her mother of the nature of Lord Moreton's attachment to her. "And can you reciprocate it, my love?" asked her mother, with an earnest, anxious look. "Joyfully, my dearest mother, with your approbation and my father's. When I was a child, I loved as a child; but I now find that my heart indorses the deeper love of the woman, together with the fondness of the child. I owe you this confidence, my dear mother; for I would not have a thought, a feeling, that might not be placed in the sacred keeping of such a precious mother." She then threw herself on the bosom of that tender mother, from whom she so soon expected to be sepa- rated, and wept as she reflected, that to be for ever separated from one whom she loved   WAIT AND SEE.      365 with all that refined, tender, truthful devotion peculiar to her sex, would be far worse. The parents felt averse to parting with their lovely young daughter: indeed, they would have felt it impossible, had not the blessed little Eli come expressly to stay in her stead. 31*  &#xD;<pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC7378-00000186"/> 366 CHAPTER LVII.

A SPLENDID ship was seen nearing New-York Harbor, which excited general observation. Her swanlike beauty, gracefully skimming the blue waves like some fairy sailing on a mist, was now an object of great attraction. So handsome and tight a craft had not before been seen by the oldest tar on terra firma. 'When she was near enough for her name to be seen through a glass, it read, "Fair Ameri- can, London." A salute from the Battery was then fired to welcome her into port. An English nobleman and suite now stepped on shore, leaving the vessel in care of its cap- tain and men; and entered the first respecta- ble-looking hotel they came to, and tarried   WAIT AND SEE.     3 67 only long enough to select a handsome carriage and four superb grays. They then proceeded by land directly to Philadelphia. If there should be any doubt, we will just inform our readers that it was nobody on earth but Lord Moreton. He arrived about ten days before Effie had completed her eighteenth year. We need not describe his reception by any but his elect. She met him with a delicate blush, - not, like his former " wardy," bounding into his arms; but, with tear-gemmed eyes and changing cheeks, extending her fair hand, without uttering a syllable. Taking her hand in his own, he stood spell-bound, gazing on the lovely child, who had advanced into the still more lovely and graceful beauty of the angelic being before him. At length, he -spoke:-- "Dearest Effie!" said he, tenderly em- bracing her; and, after a pause of mutual silence, he began:-  "You have been apprised, dearest, through the best of mediums, - your honored parents, - that I love you with a true, fervent, tender  &#xD;<pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC7378-00000187"/> 368     WAIT AND SEE. affection. I now have come to confirm with my own breath that I am yours truly and for ever. Can you, precious being, with- out a sacrifice of your inclinations, consent to become as wholly and completely mine  One little word! Let your first sentence seal my happiness or my doom." "I will!" replied Effie with solemn fervor. The scene that ensued can be better imagined than described. It was the choice of Effie and Moreton to make no display, but to have the ceremony in a plain, simple way. Edward Atherton despatched notes of invita- tion to their friends in Boston, - the Huntley Family, Theodore and Arielle, and Alfred and Fanny Darley,- requesting, in the name of Effie and Moreton, as many as could make it convenient to accompany them to London. The ceremony was to take place in the morn- ing, and they were to take their departure on the same day. After mentioning his "little rogue," as he termed him in the postscript, with all a fa-   WAIT AND SEE.      369 ther's fondness, he directed and sealed the letter, marked "Haste," and had it mailed at once. When the letters of invitation were received at Boston, they were all greatly surprised; never having heard the slightest hint that Moreton had any other than paternal regard for his fair young ward. But, as the wedding was to be private, there was no necessity of new arrangements respecting their wardrobes: and it was arranged for them to set out next morning early; for there was no time to spare, if they would arrive in season*for the bridal. "Where is Frederic?" inquired Mr. Hunt- ley. "He is gone with Lizzie to attend a scien- tific lecture, I believe," replied Mrs. Hunt- ley.. When they returned from the lecture and were told the news, and informed that they were included in the invitation, Fred rushed to his room, and locked the door. His first impulse was to commit suicide; but, not being  &#xD;<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC7378-00000188"/> 370      WAIT AND SEE. able to devise any agreeable method, he dis- missed the idea altogether, and commenced striding back and forth in great agitation, muttering curses, c" not loud, but deep." When summoned to dinner, Frederic ap. peared gay and smiling as usual. "I am delighted to see you look so comfort- able, my son," said his father. "I thought it possible that the news we got from Philadel- phia might affect you unpleasantly; coming, as it did, so unexpectedly." "By no means. It would take something more than that to make me in the least un- comfortable, dear father. I did say once to Darley, merely in jest, that she was my elect: but, pshaw! I never had any serious thoughts of her,--none; or of any one else," said Fred. "I rejoice that you are not disappointed in your views, then, my dear boy," replied his father. Lizzie was rejoiced to see her rivals drop- ping off one after another, and behaved with much suavity before the family. She sought a   WAIT AND SEE.     - 371 private interview with Fred, telling him that she had no intention of attending the wedding, or of going to ERngland either, as she was not specified in the invitation; and to go as an appendage to the family did not meet her views, by any means." "You are perfectly right, my dear Liz," said he. "Neither do I intend going myself. They will not have me in their train to grace their triumphal entry into London, I assure you." "Capital!" exclaimed Lizzie. '"Let's make- our own arrangements. I will excuse myself on the plea of not feeling quite well. You can plead some prior engagement; and we will both remain at home, and let them obtain brighter ornaments if they can," said she, laughing gayly. "Excellent, Lizzie!   You are a perfect woman at planning; a capital tactician, dear Liz.  We will do so." Their plan succeeded to a charm.

They arrived at Philadelphia in good time, bearing the regrets (1) of the engaged Frederic and the sick Lizzie.   373 CHAPTER LVIII. THE BRIDAL PARTY. - THE TENDER FAREWELL. - CONVER- SATION BETWEEN MR. HUNTLEY AND HS DAUGHTER. ON the lovely morning that ushered in the eighteenth birthday of Effie Henrietta Sinclair, she became Lady Moretoli; and a more beau. tiful, amiable bride never blessed a husband. It was not the rich gems that flashed on her graceful person, or the splendid texture of her bridal attire, that rendered her so divinely fair; but the " ornament of a meek and quiet spirit," which was her chief and brightest adornment. It was arranged, that as Mr. Huntley was rather infirm, and as Mrs. Edward Ather- ton dared not expose her little son to the bracing sea air while so young, Theodore and wife, and Darley and Fanny, should accom- pany the happy pair to London, while Mr. Huntley superintended Alfred's mercantile 32  &#xD;<pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC7378-00000190"/> 374      WAIT AND SEE. affairs at home; and that, as soon as the two couples returned to America, the seniors of the three families, and perhaps Fred and Liz- zie, should all set out to visit Effie and Moreton at their London residence. The sad adieu and the silent embrace had passed between the bride and her parents, and the dear ones to be left behind; and she was placed in the carriage, while mingled tears of joy and grief flooded her fair young face. Moreton, after affectionately kissing his new mother and the sweet babe in her arms, and taking a tender leave of the rest, sprang into the carriage, where he had previously desired their guests to be seated; and the carriage rolled swiftly out of sight. The Huntleys, after remaining a few days to sympathize with and to cheer the lonely parents of both families (for the Rev. Mr. Atherton and wife had parted with both of their children, who had gone to cross the wide ocean), departed for their home. Mr. Huntley had said to his daughter Arielle before her departure, when they   WAIT AND SEE.      3 75 chanced to be alone, "I am sorry that Lizzie is not going with you. I had hoped that some London beau, who looks on beauty as all that is requisite to make him happy, would sue for and obtain her hand." "Why, father " asked Arielle, much sur- prised. "I thought that you and mother doted on her." "Your mother, Arielle, was struck with her brightness and beauty; so much so, that she desired to adopt the child. I raised no objections, as we have enough and to spare. She made a charming little pet for us all; and so would a panther or a kitten, when very- young: but her selfish, unfeeling, imperious disposition, as she advances to maturity, has made us both very uncomfortable.  Why, Arielle, she completely rules your mother already, she is so wilful, and your mother is so yielding. As we promised to keep her, and treat her with kindness, we must do it; our word of promise must be sacredly fulfilled: but I think she is any thing but a comfort to your mother. I shall portion her, when she  &#xD;<pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC7378-00000191"/> 376     WAIT AND SEE. marries; and should think it a privilege to count out thousands to her at once, and have done with her." "Father," said Arielle, " you spoke of. the London beaux who require only personal beauty in a wife. Allow me to suggest, that this is a parallel case. They obtain the beau- ty, it is true: but it soon wanes, where there is no intellectual or moral beauty to sustain their attachment; and they then have a doll on their hands for life, which they can neither love nor avoid." "True, my dear daughter; too true in- deed." A   3" CHAPTER LIX. ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND OF THE BRIDAL PARTY. -LADY MORETON'S PORTRAIT. -FRED AND LIZZTE. THE "Fair American" arrived safely in Lon- don; and a more pleasant voyage is not often enjoyed, even by a bridal party. Lord More- ton's palace was perfectly splendid; and we could say no more if we were describing a star. The party were received with the utmost. courtesy and warmth by its noble owner; and Lady Moreton, with her winning grace, made every guest feel perfectly at home. They spent several weeks of complete enjoy- ment, and were then obliged to return; as Darley thought he could not trespass longer on Mr. Huntley's kindness in taking charge of his mercantile establishment, and Theodore felt that he could not be absent longer from his beloved charge. 32*     s"  &#xD;<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC7378-00000192"/> 378      WAIT AND SEE. The "Fair American," manned, and ready for sea, was at their disposal to return home. During their stay in London, Moreton had a full-length portrait of Effie, in her bridal dress, executed by a master artist, to send to her parents. They were in perfect rap- tures when the picture was uncovered. It fairly seemed to breathe. There were the same sweet smile, the fond, sparkling glance. How her mother almost worshipped the three loved portraits of her dear, absent daughter! They were placed in three different rooms, and were often tenderly gazed on through tears of fond affection. Lizzie and Frederic had been very friendly. and intimate during the absence of the wed- ding-party. They rode and walked, sung and danced; went to the Museum, Theatre, and painting galleries,;- together ; and were everywhere called " the handsome Huntleys." Neither of them coquetted with others for the time being. Fred, in a fit of gallantry, had requested Lizzie to sit for her portrait; which   WAIT AND SEE.      379  request she most graciously complied with, after feigning reluctance, and receiving the miniature of Fred as a sort of bribe, which she considered as a very flattering circum- stance in her favor. But soon he had other attractions. When that ivas the case, Lizzie could always com- mand the admiration and attention of any of her favorite beaux. Her dazzling beauty, sparkling wit, and reputed wealth, would do this at any time. But she never inspired a true, genuine affection; or, if so, had no moral beauty or intellectual- charm to retain what her external attractions had won. Many beaux offered her gallantry and flattery; but none of them offered her a heart, or thought of her as a wife. Fred paid particular attention to her, when none of her more favored rivals were at hand; but would have spurned the idea of being united to her for life, well knowing her utter heartlessness. Mrs. Huntley's remonstrances wer  of no avail. Lizzie was now of legal age, and had  &#xD;<pb n="380-381" xml:id="VAC7378-00000193"/> * 380     WAIT AND SEE. taken the government of herself, and, so far as it was in her power, that of the whole household, into her own hands. Frederic was now under no control but that of his own fancy and inclination; which often led him to such lengths, that he was considered one of the most reckless, wayward, dissipated young men in the city of Boston.   381 CHAPTER LX. THE VISIT TO EUROPE. - THE PRODIGAL SON. -THE MOURNING DOVE. DEATH OF MR. AND MRS. HUNTLEY. PREPARATIONS had been made for a visit to England, France, and Italy, by the  two Atherton families and the Huntleys. Frede- ric said he would go to London, but would not visit at Lord Moreton's. He would em- bark for France:; but declared his intention of meeting them in England, as he wished to be introduced to the London beauties. This last was thought rather than spoken. He de- clined, however, going in the "Fair Ame- rican ;" she being, as he supposed, the property of Lord Moreton.  He set out in advance of the rest, to meet them, he said, on their arrival; but nothing was farther from his intentions. He did not wish to have them as so many spies on his conduct, and deter- mined not to give them an opportunity.  &#xD;<pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC7378-00000194"/> 382      WAIT AND SEE. Mr. Huntley had bountifully supplied his son for the expenditures of his tour; saying, "My dear son, waste not thy substance as did the prodigal of old. You have the means of every rational enjoyment and pursuit. Do you need morel" "cc No, indeed! Thank you, dear father!" replied Fred. His parents took leave of him in his own apartment; giving him many tearful exhorta- tions and solemn warnings; eentreating him to be a blessing to them in their advanced years by adorning his high privileges, his rare talents, and his extraordinary endowments. All this Fred promised 'in the most dutiful and affectionate manner; and, fondly kissing- them both, he took his leave. Alas! how little did that wayward young man dream, when he stepped so gayly from his too fond parents, that he had seen both their loving faces for the last time! But so it proved. It had taken a considerable time to have the necessary preparations made for so long a   WAIT AND SEE.      383 tour, and it had delayed them a week or two after the departure of Frederic. The two families at Philadelphia were to meet the Huntleys at New York; where the "Fair American" lay at anchorage, ready to receive them. On the day previous to their intended de- parture for New York, a mourning dove flew into Mrs. Huntley's parlor, and gave its pecu- liar cry three times, distinctly. It then passed out; but soon returned, repeated the three moans, and fled. This was thought. rather singular and por- tentous; but, in the general stir and bustle of preparations, it was soon forgotten; That evening, Mr. Huntley sat in his libraryl until very late. Mrs. Huntley, at length, sent to apprise him of the lateness of the hour; when the servant returned, - with a piercing cry, and pale as death, - unable to utter a word. The family rushed immediately to the library. There. sat the best of husbands, best of fathers, and best of benefactors, leaning back in his large arm-chair, with his spectacles in' one  &#xD;<pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC7378-00000195"/> 384     WAIT AND SEE. hand, the other on the large Bible that lay open before him; but his soul had gone forth to meet its reward, - to receive that blessed plaudit, "Well done, good and faithful ser- vant! enter into the joy of thy Lord." The still beautiful form was cold in death. The scene that ensued cannot be described. Mrs. Huntley and Arielle had fainted on the instant; and Theodore, pale as marble, stood completely paralyzed with consternation at the sad spectacle before him. Restoratives were applied in vain; for Death had sealed that mortal form to await the "resurrection of the just." What a scene of mourning and desolation had invaded that late happy dwelling! - a sad proof that no earthly hap- piness is secure. This sad stroke had overpowered the fail- ing constitution of the bereaved wife. She was laid on her bed, from which she never more arose. She lingered for about two weeks; then joined her dear departed hus- band among the blest. What a house of mourning was there! In-   WAIT AND SEE.      385 deed, the whole city mourned the general loss. The poor- how keenly they felt the blow that laid their noble benefactors in the dust! But this lovely Christian pair had improved their "ten talents" wisely and well, and had been faithful stewards of the abundant wealth intrusted to their care. 33  &#xD;<pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC7378-00000196"/> 386 CHAPTER LXI. THE HOUSE OF MOURNING. - INDIFFERENCE OF LIZZIE. - THE READING OF THE WILL. A MESSENGER was immediately despatched to New York, where their friends were awaiting their arrival to join them in the projected tour; and, when they were eagerly expecting every hour to see them come, the shocking news came instead, which, as may be-imagined, completely overwhelmed them with grief and consternation. Both families travelled with the utmost speed until they reached the scene of deep, convulsive mourning. The face of their de- parted friend they could see no more; for the funeral and entombment had necessarily taken place before their arrival. They could but weep and condole with the living. Mrs. Huntley survived but about ten days after their arrival. She said she was resigned;   WAIT AND SEE.      387 that her dear husband had only gone a few days before her; and calmly expired. Both families of Athertons remained at the house of mourning for several weeks, where they had all spent' so many happy hours. Letters had been sent to Effie and Moreton, enclosing one for Frederic; entreating them to find out his address, if possible, and forward his letter. But, on inquiry, they found that he had left England; and they could obtain no clew to his route, and the letter never reached him. Lizzie was the only one of the whole hou-se- hold who felt calm and indifferent; but, in presence of others, she contrived to weep convulsively. She expected, from her posi- tion in the family, to be an equal heir to the inheritance. She had long been looking forward to this; and, it must be owned, rather impatiently. She therefore bore the loss of her foster-parents with much fortitude and resignation. On opening the will found in Mr. Huntley's name, it was seen that the bulk of his estate,  &#xD;<pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC7378-00000197"/> 388      wAIT AND SEE. given to his wife, was, at her decease, to be divided equally between his daughter Arielle, and his son Frederic, and Alfred Darley. Theodore and Alfred were appointed as trus- tees and executors of the will. One hundred thousand dollars were bequeathed to Arielle, the same to Frederic; fifty thousand to Theo- dore, the same to Alfred Darley:' all to be possessed at the time of his decease. To his adopted daughter, Lizzie Huntley, he had bequeathed thirty thousand, to be kept in the hands of her brother Alfred as her guardian, to be paid to her at his own discretion until the day of her marriage: it was then to be placed in the keeping of her husband. When Lizzie found that she was not made equal, and that what she had was given into the hands of her brother, she tore off her weeds at once, and showed herself in her true colors. This troubled Alfred very much: but he had, as he thought, a check-rein; and com- manded her to put on her mourning, or be stinted very much in her expenditures. "Thank you," said she: "I can marry, any   WAIT AND SEE.      389 day, and without your august sanction too, my brave guardian!" ': True," said Alfred; " and I fervently hope the day is not far distant, either." But Lizzie still persisted in dressing in the most flaunting and gaudy style. 33*  &#xD;<pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC7378-00000198"/> 390 CHAPTER LXTT. ARRIVAL HOME OF FRED. - MARRIAGE OF FRED AND TLTZZIF. - A CONFIRMED GAMBLER. - THE SUICIDE.

When he found both parents gone, he wept; ay, wept more bitter tears than a dutiful son could shed. But his grief, like all his feelings, was evanescent; and he soon became as gay as ever. Lizzie pretended to sympathize deeply; complained of her being nearly disinherited, as she was pleased to term it; and borrowed large sums of him whenever her brother refused to allow her an unreasonable sum; for Frederic, with all his faults, was very generous. Lizzie now determined to get back what she deemed her right by marrying Fred. She found that he still stood aloof from ma-   WAIT AND SEE,      391. trimony, but waited on her as before; only that he could now be more profuse in his expenditures. He went on in this way, spending his money in every possible extra- vagance, until the greater part of his inherit- ance was already spent. He had long been an occasional gambler, but now became a more frequent one, and on a larger scale; often losing thousands in one night by play- ing when his head was dizzy with intoxica- tion. His funds being nearly drained, he had now no other resource than to look forward to a marriage with some wealthy heiress; for he still had too much pride to let his friends know that he had spent all, and so soon too. Many there were who would once have thought it happiness enough in this world to have had an offer of marriage from the hand- some, wealthy Frederic Huntley; but now, his beauty impaired, his wealth gone,- why, he might go too. They would now scarcely treat him with civility, much less marry him.  &#xD;<pb n="392-393" xml:id="VAC7378-00000199"/> 392      WAIT AND SEE. Lizzie, not knowing the true state of his funds, was still intent on becoming his wife; for her proverbial extravagance had kept any of her admirers from seeking her in marriage, had there been no other reasons. At length, driven by necessity, and the hope of temporary relief from debts of ho- nor (.), Frederic offered his hand in marriage to Lizzie; and was accepted, of course. He had proposed a private marriage; telling her that it was more the ton on such occasions than display. They were united, or rather yoked; and the thirty thousand dollars were paid into his hands on the same day, accord- ing to the will. The next day, he pretended to take it to the bank; but took it to the gambling-table the next evening, where he lost twenty thou- sand, which reduced the thirty thousand to ten thousand. He then prevailed on her to remove to New York, as it was, in every respect, so much superior to Boston.  In hopes of being styled " the beauty of New York," as she had been of Boston, she readily   WAIT AND SEE.      393 consented. He first took her to a fashionable hotel, and lived on the precarious chances of the gambling-table; but having a run of ill luck, and nothing to liquidate his bills, he removed to one far inferior. Lizzie became very -cross and disagreeable: she demanded her own money; but it was gone. Fred had spent the last hundred at places where profli- gates resort. This wretched couple lived a miserable life. On being hard pushed by their landlord for the payment of his bill, Frederic was nearly distracted, and took his valuable watch and diamonds, gold snuff-box, and every thing of the kind that belonged exclusively to himself, to a pawn-broker, who had the diamonds tested, and let him have a suitable sum of mo- ney on them. He counted out the amount- of his landlord's bill, and put it by itself; saying, "The rest is mine." But it was not his long. He steered directly to a gambling hell ; played and won,-won largely; until, elated with success, he staked the whole (that is,; what- he. called his own), and lost. He was then  &#xD;<pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC7378-00000200"/> 394     WAIT AND SEE. tempted to stake what he had reserved to pay his landlord: but his benevolence, not his honor, compelled him to pay it; which he did, and gave the receipt of it to his wife, which she, with haughty spite, threw into the fire. Frederic then walked deliberately into his own room, and locked the door. The re- port of a pistol was soon heard. The inmates of the house rushed immediately to the room, broke open the door, and found a suicide! There were none present to mourn; for his wife refused to send for his friends; saying, "It is not worth while." She was secretly rejoiced to be rid of him, now that the money was gone. "I can now marry again, and wealthily too; never-fear for that. I shall not wear crape long; for I perfectly hate black, it is so unbecoming." Thus mournfully medi- tated the disconsolate (?) widow. In passing out through the room where Lizzie had burned the receipt, the landlord, observing a scrap of paper near the grate, took it up, and, finding it a part of the receipt he had just given, finished burning it, and,   WAIT AND SEE.     395 after the funeral, demanded the whole amount; which Lizzie was obliged to pay by selling a part of her costly wardrobe. The last that was ever known of the widow of Frederic Huntley, she had left New York with an Italian; whether married to him or not, no one seemed to know.  &#xD;<pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC7378-00000201"/> 396 CHAPTER LXIII. THEODORE, A GOOD SHEPHERD. - THE ATHERTONS AGAIN VISIT ENGLAND.- EFFIE'S FIRST-BORN. THEODORE and Arielle retained the Huntley mansion; where they ever after resided, a blessing to the poor, to the widow, and to the fatherless. They were greatly beloved by all classes. Theodore still continued the clerical care of his first flock; and a more humble, faithful shepherd never tended the fold of God, or fed the Saviour's sheep. The Atherton brothers, with their families, had now returned to Philadelphia. The Rev. Mr. Atherton still continued the pastoral care of the church over which he first settled, to the entire satisfaction of the society; and he received a liberal salary. Edward Atherton and his wife kept up the correspondence with Effie and Moreton, who had sent by Theodore, when he left England,   WAIT AND SEE.      397 a deed of gift of the "Fair American," with all her splendid furniture and fixtures, to the infant Eli Winthrop Atherton, subject to the regency of his parents; who were doubly de- lighted with the gift for its being thus pre- sented. When little Eli was about two years of- ages his parents, with their brother and wife, -embarked with him for England in his own vessel. They had an excellent passage, and found Effie and Moreton in perfect health, and extremely happy with a sweet little daughter, about three months old. Moreton and his wife were in perfect raptures on  seeing their beloved friends, and nothing was spared to render their visit delightful. After a few weeks happily spent, they felt obliged to return, as the Rev. Mr. Atherton could not longer be ab- sent from his clerical duties. It was hard for mother and daughter to separate: but each had a lovely babe as a salvo; and, when the heart is filled with one object, it is less adhesive to others. 34  &#xD;<pb n="398-399" xml:id="VAC7378-00000202"/> 398      WAIT AND SEE. Before they left, it was arranged that young Eli's vessel should often cross the ocean which spread so widely between them, and separated them so far; and the parting adieus were made.   399 CHAPTER   LXIV. A LAST LOOK AT RYEFIELD.-- UNCLE BEN AND AUNT l    NABBY. WE will just take a parting look at Ryefield before we close. Anna Darley was married, and had gone to the Far West, where they soon had an excellent farm, and every thing plentiful, comfortable, and convenient. She and her husband lived a contented, happy life. Mr. Bolton, of the Crown and Anchor, had been dead about three months, leaving .Mrs. Bolton a dashing widow. She wore black, it is true; but so bedizened with frills, embroi- dery, black bugles, jet jewelry, edgings, and the like, that one would almost pity her that common decency compelled her to wear black at all. Uncle Ben and Aunt Nabby lived alone, because they chose to do so. They lacked  &#xD;<pb n="400-401" xml:id="VAC7378-00000203"/> 400     WAIT AND SEE. for nothing, as Alfred supplied them bounti- fully with money, which they kept locked up in an old red chest at the head of their bed, "against a time of need," they said. They dared not appear otherwise than extremely poor, for fear of being robbed. We now leave Uncle Ben and Aunt Nabby just where we found them, and the reader to extract the moral of this story.
