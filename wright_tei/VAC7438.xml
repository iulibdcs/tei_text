THE ALPINE GIU&#xD;
BY PAUL PRESTON.&#xD;
C HAP T ER I.&#xD;
THE FETE OF SAINT THEREBE.&#xD;
"HULLo! nobody at home !" shouted a young villager,.as h&#xD;
the basement chamber of the chalet of Jean Claude, pit&#xD;
situated at the base of Mount Cenis in Savoy. " Dame G&#xD;
is doubtless within her chamber, and perchance Jean Claud&#xD;
wise there also,"&#xD;
The .young Savoyard, familiarly known to the villagers of&#xD;
let, at the base of Mount Cenis, as Petit Pierre, was one&#xD;
hardy, active and enduring peasants, whoseintegrity and cour&#xD;
rendered the name of his countrymen a proverb for zeal and&#xD;
Noiselessly he opened one of the lateral doors and exclaimed&#xD;
voice, " Hold ! there hg is sleeping amid the fern leaves ! TJ&#xD;
fellow may have toiled wearily yester-night; well," he continue&#xD;
deposited upon the table of the little apartment, or rather&#xD;
court, an ample supply of freshly gathered flowers, glisten&#xD;
the dew of early morn, "Genevieve has already prepared th&#xD;
of Saint Therese and hung up hergarland.; I willgo to work&#xD;
up the vases.&#xD;
True enough, it was upon the fete of Saint Theese in the ye&#xD;
when the Savoyard devoutly prosecuted his work of adorning&#xD;
mestic shrine of his patronal Saint. By the way of further e&#xD;
his proceedings he sang a characteristic song of his nation,&#xD;
tuneful melody, for which the hardy mountaineers are note&#xD;
verity ! the free air of the hills gives an extra rest to the pa&#xD;
pouring-of humble, yet independent, souls.&#xD;
The ,peasant had scarce finished the opening stanza of his s&#xD;
a figure emerged through the doorway he had previously op&#xD;
advanced towards him. The man bore all the appearance of&#xD;
still his clothes were rough and destitute of ornament, espeA&#xD;

over-coat from which its owner shook off the particles of fern leaves,&#xD;
adhering to it from pressure of his body, during a rude slumber,&#xD;
with an air of solicitation.&#xD;
" Well, mine host," quoth the new comer, " things breathe an air&#xD;
of refreshing gaiety, this morning."&#xD;
" Eh ?" returned Pierre, stopping short in his minstrelsy, "how ?&#xD;
-this is not Jean Claude."&#xD;
" Hold !" ejaculated the stranger, examining the peasant with a rapid&#xD;
scrutinizing glance ; " this is not Jean Claude. Ah ! from your actions,&#xD;
my fine fellow, I should be inclined to believe you a gay and joyous&#xD;
friend of the family."&#xD;
" That indeed am I," continued the peasant, resuming his labors in&#xD;
the tasteful distribution of his flowers, " and moreover I am the god&#xD;
father of their child-still I have never seen you here before."&#xD;
"That don't astonish me at all," good-hurnoredly responded the&#xD;
new corner, who appeared a hale, hearty and benevolent inai, "I lost&#xD;
my way last night in the mountains ; Jean Claude, whom I encountered&#xD;
accidentally, has, perchance, saved me from falling into some abyss&#xD;
and offered me a 1ook in his hospitable cottage, where I have slum-&#xD;
bered soundly to this hour."&#xD;
I can recognise the work of Jean Claude in that," joyfully ex-&#xD;
claimed Petit Pierre, eviineiiig an infantile admiration for his new&#xD;
mountain friend, who had honored hun by the sponsorship of his&#xD;
child.&#xD;
" Has he gone hence ?" inquired the unknown.&#xD;
" I should judge so," replied the peasant, taking his vase filled with&#xD;
flowers and disposing of them with muth taste upon a side-board at&#xD;
the end of the apartment.&#xD;
" Ah! my friend," quoth the stranger, gaily, " then to day is a holy&#xD;
day, a religious festival."&#xD;
"This day is the fete of Saint Therese," quickly responded the&#xD;
young peasant, " and upon this day not an inhabitant of the mountain&#xD;
fails either to offer a bouquet to the Saint or a prayer at her shrine.&#xD;
Hence, this very morning, at the break of day, I have rang the bells,&#xD;
yes, a double set of chimes."&#xD;
"Then you are the bell ringer ?" familiarly remarked the stranger,&#xD;
whose manners exhibited hiin a man of quality.&#xD;
" Bell ringer and wooden shoemaker at your service," respectfully&#xD;
responded the Savoyard. " It was I who rang the chimes at the mar-&#xD;
riage of Jean Claude."&#xD;
"I trust he has taken unto him an excellent wife," returned the&#xD;
stranger.&#xD;
" As excellent as she is kind,". frankly replied the peasant,." and&#xD;
beautiful as she is excellent."&#xD;
The light tread of a female disturbed the conference, and both&#xD;
turning around, beheld a young woman at the further end of the cham-&#xD;
ber.&#xD;
" You can judge for yourself," whispered the Savoyard to his com-&#xD;
panion. Then advancing to the young woman, he saluted her kindly;&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ALPINE GUIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
5&#xD;
&#xD;
'Madam Genevieve." " Good morning, Pierre," answered she, in a&#xD;
musical voice.&#xD;
The guest gazed upon the wife of Jean Claude, and was astounded&#xD;
it the surpassing beauty of, the woman whom he expected to find an&#xD;
ordinary peasant of the country. Genevieve was a young girl evi-&#xD;
dently of Italian extraction, of purely classic features, with a full&#xD;
black eye and a Madonna-like expression of countenance. Although&#xD;
garbed in the common costume of the Savoy, the chastity of the ma-&#xD;
terial, the artistic manner of its make, and above all the exquisite&#xD;
elegance of her own mien, evoked a semi-audible expression of sur-&#xD;
prise from the stranger, as- he scrutinized her personal appearance.&#xD;
Rarely had he encountered a being more beautiful !&#xD;
"I have been impatient," observed the unknown, advancing politely&#xD;
to the wife of the Alpine Guide, " to offer to you, Madam, as well as&#xD;
to your husband, my grateful thanks for your most unexpected and&#xD;
opportune hospitality -.-"&#xD;
"Poor enough, indeed," modestly interrupted Genevieve ; "still,&#xD;
such as it was, I assure you it was offered in full sincerity of the&#xD;
heart."&#xD;
"What, what, what !" interrupted Pierre, warmly, " who has a&#xD;
more sincere heart----"&#xD;
" I pray thee, my friend," in turn interrupted Claude's wife, "do&#xD;
not speak so loud-you will wake the sleeping child."&#xD;
" Pardon," replied the young Savoyard, considerately, "pardon,&#xD;
the dear little Jane sleeps-yes, we must speak lower."&#xD;
" Ah !" exclaimed Genevieve, as she turned and beheld the flowers&#xD;
with which Petit Pierre had garnished the sideboard, " what most&#xD;
beautiful bouquets !"&#xD;
" Nothing, Madam Genevieve," modestly replied the peasant, "no-&#xD;
thing but two handfuls : I could not find the chaplet of good mother&#xD;
Marianne."&#xD;
" Jean Claude, who has gone to the Grand Bourge," responded his&#xD;
wife, " has"taken it with him to have it blessed."&#xD;
" Then your husband has gone to the Grand Bourge ?" inquired&#xD;
the stranger.&#xD;
"But he will return," replied Genevieve.&#xD;
"Unfortunately too late," resumed the unknown guest, " for me to&#xD;
be able to shake his hand before I will be compelled to take my de&#xD;
parture. I am really sorry."&#xD;
" Are you going to Chambery ?"&#xD;
" Not that way," replied the stranger ; "on the contrary, in quite&#xD;
.an -opposite direction. I am  desirous of traversing over Mount&#xD;
Cenis."&#xD;
" But, sir," remonstrated Genevieve, gently, "you cannot at this&#xD;
present moment travel up the mountain."&#xD;
" And for what reason ?" politely inquired 'the guest. /&#xD;
"For one good reason," interrupted Petit Pierre, "because in this&#xD;
month we mountaineers only navigate during the night; for, you see,&#xD;
during the day the sun melts the snow, which comes down in torrents&#xD;
to our village."&#xD;

THE ALPINE GUIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Well! it's all the same," energetically replied the unknown, as if&#xD;
determined to have his own way, "I will attempt -"&#xD;
" To drown yourself to reach it the sooner," quoth the deep voice&#xD;
of Jean Claude, as the Alpine.Guide entered the apartment, amid a&#xD;
general exclamation of delight and surprise.&#xD;
" I counsel you against any such rashness," continued the moun-&#xD;
taineer, shaking the dirt and dust off his garments. Then addressing&#xD;
his wife, he continued gaily : " Good morning, Genevieve ! eh ! and&#xD;
you here, my little Pierre !" With this salutation the Guide shook&#xD;
his friend's hand warmly.&#xD;
" Yes, I am here," laughingly replied the peasant, pointing tp his&#xD;
shoes ; "I put on my new boots to pay you a visit."&#xD;
" How fresh you are this morning !" replied Jean.&#xD;
" Because I am dying with hunger," retorted Pierre.&#xD;
" Then let us have some breakfast," gaily added the Guide, who&#xD;
turned to his guest: "Await until evening, it will then be practicable&#xD;
-now it is impossible."&#xD;
Thus speaking, Jean Claude, accompanied by his wife, walked to&#xD;
the domestic shrine and attached to it a chaplet.&#xD;
" I am much annoyed at the impossibility of my departure," re-&#xD;
marked the unknown, addressing the Guide.&#xD;
" There is no use swearing," returned Jean Claude, frankly ; " it&#xD;
cannot be helped, and I will tell you the best thing to do- .&#xD;
" What is that ?" inquired the stranger.&#xD;
" To set the table, and make an excuse of breakfast," replied Jean.&#xD;
" Agreed !" gaily answered the stranger, and without more ado the&#xD;
entire party set them at work arranging the table for the simple, yet&#xD;
nutritious meal which was to be spread before them.&#xD;
"Hold, wife," observed Claude to Genevieve with a suppressed&#xD;
sigh as they walked apart at the end of the apartment ; " you&#xD;
perceive that our golden medallions have been changed into pewter."&#xD;
" It is all the same," gently responded the young woman, as she&#xD;
passed the string of a locket over her neck, " as long-as the souve-&#xD;
nir they contain remains unchanged."&#xD;
" And now I have six crowns to set us right," remarked the Guide&#xD;
affectionately ; " and how is our little darling ?"&#xD;
"tShe was as gay this morning," joyfully responded the wife, "as&#xD;
the newly risen lark."&#xD;
" And now !" inquired Jean with a sigh of inquietude.&#xD;
" She sleeps like a little hedge-hog," laughingly replied his wife.&#xD;
"And perchance," continued the Guide anxiously, " the fever will&#xD;
return no more."&#xD;
"1I pray to God that it would not," fervently returned Genevieve.&#xD;
" Come, the table is set !" gaily shouted Jean, " to breakfast."&#xD;
" I am there !" ejaculated Pierre, taking his seat.&#xD;
" Stop !" quoth Jean, seizing the stranger, who appeared about to&#xD;
leave, " an unexpected guest upon the day of St. Therese-it is a&#xD;
sign of good luck to our family ! Now serve us, Genevieve," he&#xD;
continued as-the stranger assumed his place.&#xD;
&#xD;
" And now we are'allseated," interrupted Pierre, "I must tell you&#xD;
that I have bought something by the way of dessert."&#xD;
" What is it ?" inquired Jean, as he observed the bell-ringer draw.&#xD;
ing from his pocket a piece of printed paper.&#xD;
" The account of the taking of Montmotre by the French," returned&#xD;
Pierre triumphantly.&#xD;
" It is the bulletin of the 14th of this month," remarked the&#xD;
stranger.&#xD;
Genevieve will read it to us," exclaimed Jean, joyfully, " for&#xD;
Genevieve knows how to read, to write and to make sums. Read to&#xD;
us, my dear wife, for we are all ears."&#xD;
In compliance with the request, Genevieve read as follows :&#xD;
" Upon the evening of the 14th the action commenced. After a&#xD;
combat of two hours, General Colti, who had succeeded in gaining&#xD;
the plaine, threatened to envelope the French, held in check before&#xD;
Mount motte, where Colonel Roger, finding an opportunity for&#xD;
manoeuvering the cavalry, hitherto idle, charged at full gallop with&#xD;
his regiment upon Colti 's division.  The enemy was evidently&#xD;
shaken and the Commander-in-chief, General Bonaparte, profited by&#xD;
the extraction of the left wing to order the assault. The victory was&#xD;
complete, and the general-in-chief has named Colonel Roger to be a&#xD;
general of brigade upon the battle-field."&#xD;
"Again a victory !" enthusiastically proclaimed Jean Claude.&#xD;
" Colonel Roger has gained 'his epaulets as a general !" exclaimed&#xD;
the bell ringer gaily, "let's drink his health? Madan Genevieve,"&#xD;
filling her a glass, "Here, is the health of the brave General Roger !"&#xD;
" His health," responded Genevieve, "he has my best wishes."&#xD;
" Unfortunately each victory leads to fresh combats," remarked&#xD;
the unknown. "The Austrians, who have received fresh reinforce-&#xD;
ments, have closed all the roads to Mount Cenis."&#xD;
" Yes, after the French passed," responded Pierre : "they have&#xD;
done as the worthy fellow, who bought a lock after the horse was&#xD;
stolen."&#xD;
s" Yes," resatn9d the unknown, arising from the table, "the God&#xD;
of battles will ne'v er desert the French !"&#xD;
" Oh I   would so delight in var," exclaimed Pierre, "if I had&#xD;
no fear of the great big' cannons. "&#xD;
" The noise of the cannon then is more dangerous than that of the&#xD;
big bell," responded Genevieve, smilingly.&#xD;
"Thank you!" rejoined Petit Pierre, rising from his seat, "you&#xD;
have put me in mind that I have to ring the bells for vespers. But I&#xD;
will return in the evening, Jean Claude.&#xD;
"And bring your new boots with you ?" jocularily replied the&#xD;
Guide, smiling at his allusion to the wooden shoes.&#xD;
" These boots," rejoined the bell ringer, "are of famous leather,&#xD;
however, both sole and uppers are of one piece. This leather, you&#xD;
perceive, sometimes cracks but never rips.-To-night then-"&#xD;
" To-night then, my little Pierre," replied Jean Claude as the-&#xD;
peasart emerged haQtulv to attend to his duties.&#xD;

THE ALPINE GUIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Hark ! I hear the child cry," remarked Genevieve as she&#xD;
abruptly arose to quit the apartment, and to attend to her babe.&#xD;
"Go, my wife, and bring it, hither," interrupted the Guide, "1I will&#xD;
take it into the fields with me-The air is rure outside--"&#xD;
" And I," interrupted the stranger, " will be pleased to see it."&#xD;
"I will go and bring it," replied Genevieve, " only I must dress it."&#xD;
" Dress it," smilingly replied Jean; " ever the way with mothers !&#xD;
To show you her babe, she must exhibit its clothing. Yes," he con-&#xD;
tinued to the stranger, ' it is a weakness mothers have who admire&#xD;
their offspring ;" then added in a low tone to Genevieve, " put on its&#xD;
new clothes and pretty little cap."&#xD;
"Be at your ease," confidentially responded the young wife as she&#xD;
hurriedly left the apartment.&#xD;
"Ah ! my comrade," observed the Guide, a moment after the&#xD;
departure of Genevieve, " you appear to be very sad."&#xD;
"No," replied the unknown; "I was thinking how surprising it is&#xD;
that, in this country, you could have found a woman like your wife ;&#xD;
Genevieve-"&#xD;
" Has an education ;" interrupted the delighted husband. " You&#xD;
are not the first, who have been thus astonished, and I will explain&#xD;
the reason. I was very young when an avalanche caused a terrible&#xD;
catastrophe in this region. Two days after this calamity, my mother,&#xD;
Marianne Thibaut, returned to the house in the evening, bringing a&#xD;
female child which she had found in the snow. It was cold as an ici-&#xD;
cle, but its little heart beat, and my mother soon succeeded in res-&#xD;
toring it to warmth. We could see from its little embroidered shoes,&#xD;
and- the necklace of pearls that it was an Italian. Well, both father&#xD;
and mother were dead, and we never heard of them afterwards. My&#xD;
mother searched everywhere, showing the pearl neckl ce ; one day&#xD;
she said to me, 'the little one belongs to rich people, and not people&#xD;
of evil and misery like us, for a jeweler of Chambery tells me that&#xD;
the necklace is well worth a hundred pistoles. 1 have sold it to him,&#xD;
as it is necessary that Genevieve-(we called her Genevieve)--shall&#xD;
be well brought up and not suffer from having been accidentally&#xD;
thrown among poor people. This money will serve to clothe her and&#xD;
educate her, and as to daily bread she will divide with us while the&#xD;
Good Deity gives it us.' Then.my mother paid the pastor of the&#xD;
hamlet to teach Genevieve to read the Bible, and I became a wagon-&#xD;
er, walking from town to town to gain sufficient money to last us&#xD;
during the winter. After I had made a good many journeys Gene-&#xD;
vieve had become both learned and beautiful, and my mother said to&#xD;
me, 'Jean Claude, Genevieve is now seventeen years of age, and our&#xD;
family needs a protector. You, my son, have labored hard, and let&#xD;
us now expend our earnings upon four acres of ground, and through&#xD;
Heaven's mercy we will never be forced to leave it.' From that hour&#xD;
I remained with them and we have been happy until about three&#xD;
years ago, when our poor mother died and went the way of all good&#xD;
souls."&#xD;
" Then you lost your benefactor," remarked the stranger.&#xD;
&#xD;
" And I mourn her loss deeply," resumed the Guide, "for the world&#xD;
is ever unjust. Soon was I forced to say to Genevieve, ' you know&#xD;
we are not brother and sister, and there are scandalous tongues-the&#xD;
good mother is no longer with us, and fvr the sake of your honor, we&#xD;
must needs separate ; you, Genevieve, keep the cottage-as for me, I&#xD;
will make a fortune in some - distant spot.' Genevieve commenced&#xD;
weeping, and I found it impossible to leave her. Then we found a&#xD;
means to silence scandalous tougues, and when two days after the cu-&#xD;
rate of Saint Martain married us, something in my heart told me that&#xD;
Genevieve was not created for one so poor as I am."&#xD;
" It seems, on the contrary," interposed the stranger, "that your&#xD;
marriage had been decreed in advance."&#xD;
" I know not I" resumed the Guide. " The first year of our union&#xD;
the blessing of heaven descended upon us. Heaven has given us a&#xD;
little girl an angel like her mother. Still, for two years back we have&#xD;
had but little prosperity."&#xD;
"How comes that ?" inquired the unknown.&#xD;
" At first the child was ill," rejoined Jean Claude, "and during the&#xD;
past year hail destroyed our crops. Luckily we had some savings--..&#xD;
but this year the Austrians, in passing through this place, have done&#xD;
more damage than all the storms. Our savings have been exhausted&#xD;
to the last penny. There is no means of selling our bit of land, for&#xD;
the war has driven away all purchasers. And now behold us forced&#xD;
to seek for work in large cities, which grieves me, as denevieve never&#xD;
served anybody. Now since our daughter has recovered sufficiently&#xD;
to travel with us, nothing remains but to depart upon our pilgrim-&#xD;
" But to undertake your journey," interrupted the stranger, " you&#xD;
will have need of money---and -"&#xD;
"I have enough," replied Jean. "Yes, when we were in prosperity&#xD;
I purchased two golden medallions, because, you see, necessity often&#xD;
compels me to be absent to sell our hemp---and then we had a mutual&#xD;
souvenir to console us in our absence. This may appear to you&#xD;
strange, but we have such ideas in this country, where we love one&#xD;
another so dearly."&#xD;
" And I," interrupted the unknown, " ever wear mementos of my&#xD;
wife and son."&#xD;
" Then we can understand each other," remarked Jean in continua-&#xD;
tion, " this morning I was at the Grand Bourg to exchange my gold&#xD;
for pewter, as you see, but the souvenir is not changed. Mine con-&#xD;
tains the hair and writing of Genevieve. In hers there is my hair,&#xD;
but not my writing for the reason-Hush ! here comes Genevieve, do&#xD;
not speak to her of our journey, it renders her so sad."&#xD;
" Have I kept you long waiting?" inquired the young wife as she&#xD;
entered and presented to him his angelic babe.&#xD;
"You have been long enough to dress yourself for 'a wedding,"&#xD;
laughingly ejaculated the Guide.&#xD;
"What a lovely babe !" instinctively spoke the stranger.&#xD;
" And if you knew how cunning it is !" affectionately quoth the&#xD;

husband ; " and now to the fields, where the little one can play until&#xD;
evening."&#xD;
The Savoyard tenderly shouldered his child, and gaily danced it in&#xD;
the air.&#xD;
" What are you to do in the fields ?" inquired the stranger.&#xD;
"To dig.out the ditches the Austrians have filled up," responded,&#xD;
the Guide.&#xD;
"Shall I lend you a helping hand," interposed the unknown.&#xD;
" Willingly, my friend," replied Jean Claude.&#xD;
" Au revoir, Dame Genevieve," kindly said the stranger.&#xD;
" Are you happy' and content ?" quoth the Guide to the child in&#xD;
his arms, " my little Jane, that your father carries you into the fields,&#xD;
as he gaily sings :&#xD;
"'Youp ! youp ! laliretto !&#xD;
Youp ! youp ! lalirou!'&#xD;
Come, comrade-now to the green heather.'&#xD;
" Take care and do not stumble over the stones," quoth Genevieve&#xD;
affectionately, as the Guide and his guest departed.&#xD;
" No danger," gaily responded Jean, renewing his mountain song&#xD;
as he led the way to the broken ditches.&#xD;
CHAPTER            II.&#xD;
A LESSON IN MYSTERY.&#xD;
"Poon Jean," soliloquized Genevieve, after her husband had left&#xD;
her to commence his daily labor ; " how happy is he with his treasure&#xD;
in his arms ! and yet we are poor-true the riches of the heart dispel&#xD;
not misery, and we are soon to commence our journey. Well, we&#xD;
must not grieve, for it is God's pleasure ! let' us hasten to arrange&#xD;
everything for a departure." -&#xD;
While Genevieve set about clearing away the breakfast things, and&#xD;
in arranging the apartment with neatness,&#xD;
" Pardon, Madam," quoth a stranger, who unexpectedly entered&#xD;
the cottage, " but am I far from Saint Martin ?"&#xD;
"Two leagues," affably returned the young wife.&#xD;
"Still two leagues," muttered the traveller.S&#xD;
"Are you fatigued ?" anxiously inquired Genevieve.&#xD;
" I have walked for over three hours," replied the stranger, who,&#xD;
from his dress and manners, appeared a man of good social standing.&#xD;
"I have come from the Grand Bourg, and have yet to go to Saint&#xD;
Martin."&#xD;
" Then allow me to advise you to rest awhile," quoth the young&#xD;
wife, with an air of solicitude ; "the house of Jean Claude is situated&#xD;
nearly half way."    '&#xD;
"This, then, is the place," murmured the traveller to himself; and&#xD;
&#xD;
TEE ALPINE GUIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
11&#xD;
&#xD;
speaking more loudly, he continued : " I willingly avail myself of&#xD;
your hospitality."&#xD;
" And if you would say a prayer to the saint," resumed Genevieve,&#xD;
,pointing to the chaplet hanging against the wall, "that chaplet is&#xD;
made of fragments from the grey rock."&#xD;
The traveller seated himself and continued the conversation.&#xD;
"Is this, then, the grey rock, so celebrated throughout Savoy ?"&#xD;
" The rock of Saint Therese," replied the Guide's wife.&#xD;
" I know nothing of its history,"-frankly answered the stranger.&#xD;
" Truly !" exclaimed Genevieve, with unaffected- astonishment.&#xD;
" It is stated that during the religious war, when slaughter and&#xD;
famine desolated this country, Saint Therese descended from heaven&#xD;
to bestow bread upon the little children. The grey rock on which&#xD;
she reposeed, sank beneath her to such a degree that even now can&#xD;
be seen the impression of her feet and of the folds of her long white&#xD;
robe."&#xD;
" And the beads of this chaplet," quoth the traveller, going up to&#xD;
it and examining it seriously, "are of this rock ?"&#xD;
" It is not to be doubted," replied Genevieve, "for the chaplet was&#xD;
given by a monk of Saint Bernard to the mother of my husband."&#xD;
"To the mother of Jean Claude ?" inquired the stranger.&#xD;
"Then you know his name ?" remarked the wife of Claude.&#xD;
" I know yours likewise," resumed the stranger.&#xD;
" I am named Genevieve," frankly replied the young wife.&#xD;
Genevieve is the name given to you by the mother Marianne,"&#xD;
retured the traveller complacently, " but it is not that which you&#xD;
you received from your father and mother.&#xD;
"And you know the names of my parents ?" anxiously inquired&#xD;
the young mother.&#xD;
" Your father," commenced the stranger, " Emanuel Loredan, mar-&#xD;
quis of Ferrars, and your mother, were swallowed up, with you and&#xD;
two domestics, by a terrible avalanche. You- alone, a small child,&#xD;
was saved by Dame Marianne, who found you by the roadside. At&#xD;
twenty years, you married the son of Dame Thibaut, who died a&#xD;
little while previously."&#xD;
" An'd how know you this ?" inquired Genvieve.&#xD;
" [ know it from your uncle, Antonio Loredan," replied the travel-&#xD;
ler. " He discovered a pearl necklace, with a Jew of Ferrara, who&#xD;
had purchased it from a jeweller of Chambery. He recognized the&#xD;
necklace as the one he placed around your neck at the time of your&#xD;
baptism, and had the jeweller questioned, who revealed what Jean&#xD;
Claude had told him ; and thus. was convinced of the existence of his&#xD;
niece."&#xD;
"My uncle !" exclaimed Genevieve, in astonishment.&#xD;
" Although ill, and well advanced in years," returned the stranger,&#xD;
"he desired to traverse Italy to seek after you in Savoy, but his&#xD;
expectation was deceived. Forced to stop at Milan, he died, leaving.&#xD;
a will of which I have an exact copy, which I will read to you--"&#xD;
"Is this aught but a dream ?" murmured Genevieve.&#xD;

THE ALPINE GUIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Italian took from his pocket a document, which he perused as&#xD;
follows:&#xD;
'I constitute as my sole heir, my niece and god-daughter, Maria&#xD;
Loredan, of whose existence I am recently apprised, upon the express&#xD;
condition, however, that she will inhabit my palace of Ferrara and&#xD;
resume the names and titles of her ancestors, after having annulled&#xD;
her marriage with Jean Claude Thibaut, the Alpine Guide  -"&#xD;
" Never !" emphatically exclaimed the young wife.&#xD;
" If, contrary to these provisions, Marie Loredan refuses to fulfill&#xD;
these expressed conditions, the estate will revert entire, at the end of&#xD;
a year and a day, to the monks of the Convent of the Barnabites of&#xD;
la Concordia, where 1 desire to be buried. Signed at Milan, this twen-&#xD;
tieth of April, one thousand seven hundred and ninety five, by me,&#xD;
Antonio Loredan, Count d'Este and Proveditor of Venice."&#xD;
" Still all that is but a test, an invention, a mockery," responded&#xD;
Genevieve, at a loss to realize the truth of the document.&#xD;
" If this were not the truth,"remarked the stranger, "think you I&#xD;
would have journeyed so far out of my way to communicate with you.&#xD;
Should you desire positive proof, you have but to follow me, without&#xD;
confiding your secret to Jean Claude ; in four days, we will reach&#xD;
Venice, where you will be received by a family expecting your arrival&#xD;
impatiently, and who fears seeing the palaces of the Loredans become&#xD;
the property of monks. There, you will find all proofs, incontestably&#xD;
clear ; you will obtain the annulment of your marriage, by you con-&#xD;
tracted in ignorance of your birth-and instead of being poor in the&#xD;
Savoy, you will be rich in Venice."&#xD;
" And my husband ?" inquired Genevieve, "my daughter ?"&#xD;
" We will secretly carry the child away with us," responded the&#xD;
stranger, " for there is nothing in the will against it. As to your&#xD;
husband the terms of the will are express."&#xD;
"I have Jistened to you, Sir, calmly," proudly returned Genevieve,&#xD;
'and I do not find myself insulted for I am not the woman, in search&#xD;
of whom you are. Maria Loredan has perished amid the snows ; I&#xD;
am Genevieve, who never had other family, save that of the Dame&#xD;
Marianne, who adopted me in my helplessness, and of Jean Thibaut,&#xD;
whom I love and who is the father of my child. To enjoy the rights&#xD;
of Maria Loredan, I would have to abandon my husband ; but if I&#xD;
am Maria Loredan, I can unconditionally enjoy the heritage of my&#xD;
father, ''&#xD;
"Your father," continued the stranger, "dissipated his fortune in a&#xD;
passion for traveling ; your uncle, who has husbanded his, died thrice&#xD;
a millionair'e-and you know at what price you can obtain possession&#xD;
of this immense fortune."&#xD;
'And-if I refuse," remonstrated (4nevieve.&#xD;
" It will enrich the monks of Le  _mcordia," replied the Italian.&#xD;
" Then let the monks," continue tme young wife, "erect a tomb of&#xD;
marble and fine gold to him who has so greatly enriched them.".&#xD;
" Still-" interrupted the Venetian.&#xD;
" You will say to my relative in Venice," resolutely resumed the&#xD;

wife of Jean Claude, " that Genevieve has refused to quit the cottage&#xD;
where she has lost her second mother, where her brother had cherish-&#xD;
ed her, and where her husband daily blesses her."&#xD;
"I conceive but one thing," returned the stranger, "affection ren-&#xD;
ders you indeed blind."&#xD;
"Say, rather it enlightens me," responded Gonevieve.&#xD;
" I will not insist longer in advising you," replied the stranger,&#xD;
pacing the apartment, and returning to the young woman, he contin-&#xD;
ued : "I will return when you have deeply reflected."&#xD;
S" Oh, no !" remonstrated Genevieve, "my husband may encounter&#xD;
you. For Heaven's sake remain here no longer ; avoid his sight-&#xD;
he may know you--he may have a suspicion."&#xD;
" He knows me not," returned the Italian, "I assure you, I have&#xD;
only an inclination to converse with you in private."&#xD;
" And I," resumed the Guide's wife, " have no desire to see you."&#xD;
"That will not answer my purpose," murmured the Venetian, as he&#xD;
gazed upon the pensive Genevieve. " By accidentally, as it were,&#xD;
leaving my valise, I will have a legitimate excuse for my return."&#xD;
Then he continued in a loud voice.&#xD;
"I am about to continue my journey. You have nothing to say&#xD;
to me, Madame."&#xD;
" I have only," returned the young wife, "to inquire who you are ?"&#xD;
"A Venetian Nobleman," was the response.&#xD;
"'What interest has guided you in this mission ?" inquired the af-&#xD;
flicted wife.&#xD;
"No personal interest whateverr" responded the stranger; "I love&#xD;
adventures, and I have believed it my duty to inform Genevieve Thi-&#xD;
baut that she can resuscitate a noble heritage."&#xD;
" Genevieve has not the power of doing so;" returned the wife of&#xD;
the Guide; " a clause in the will precludes her doing so."&#xD;
" You will be a better judge ere long," retorted the traveler, as he&#xD;
emerged from the cottage.&#xD;
" Is this not a dream ?" soliloquised Genevieve, as she meditated&#xD;
upon the strange relation which had been made to her. "Yes, Dame&#xD;
Marianne has often told inc that my family was rich, and of Italian&#xD;
parentage. And what have they offered to me ? Does a mother&#xD;
await me   Is it a father who'calls me ? ' No ! it is gold in exchange&#xD;
for my affection, gold in exchange for the existence of my husband-&#xD;
for if Jean, returning here some day, were to find the cradle empty,&#xD;
and the house vacant, he would lose his reason, he would emerge&#xD;
hence and go forth, shouting for us,, until he would fall down, worn&#xD;
1 out by fatigue, or dead from grief. But no, my good Jean Claude,&#xD;
the weeping Genevieve loves ,thee too deeply from \he bottom of her&#xD;
heart."&#xD;
" Genevieve," quoth Jean, in a suppressed tone of voice as he en-&#xD;
tered bearing the child in his arms, " the child is fast asleep, now&#xD;
put her to bed tranquilly."&#xD;
" Yes," murmured the young wife.&#xD;
" As for me," rejoined the Guide,1" I have come for the two pick&#xD;

axes with which we will finish our work. But what ails theeGene-&#xD;
vieve ? you have been weeping ?"t-n&#xD;
" No," replied Genevieve, taking the child into her arms.&#xD;
"No," ejaculated theGuide, "1 can notice it myself, what has caused&#xD;
you this trouble ?"&#xD;
" Nothing," replied Genevieve, "I assure you nothing."&#xD;
" But," said Jean Claude looking around him, " what is this ?" he&#xD;
continued as he stumbled over the valise.&#xD;
" A valise," said Genevieve, in astonishment, " forgotten by a&#xD;
stranger, who rested himself here awhile."&#xD;
" What is that written upon this ?" inquired the Guide, pointing to&#xD;
a brass plate attached to the valise.&#xD;
" Luidgi of Venice," read the obedient wife.&#xD;
" Luidgi of Venice," repeated the Savoyard, " has he told thee aught&#xD;
which has given you pain ?"&#xD;
" In no wise," replied Genevievp, " while he rested, I showed him&#xD;
the chaplet of the grey rock. He was ignorant of its history, which&#xD;
I related to him."&#xD;
" Is that all?" anxiously inquired the Guide.&#xD;
" That is all, my friend," returned Genevieve, "I will go and put&#xD;
our little Jane to bed."&#xD;
" Go, Genevieve, go, for sleep will do her good," replied Jean, as his&#xD;
wife glided noiselessly out of the apartment with the sleeping child&#xD;
tenderly embraced within her arms.&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
THE WAGES OF COURAGE.&#xD;
JEAN CLAUDE placed the valise upon the table, and fell into a deep&#xD;
mneditati6n upon the cause of the untoward incident he had noticed.&#xD;
Vainly could his gentle wife deny the fact of her sorrow; the traces of&#xD;
grief were too palpable to be concealed. Poor Jean heaved'a deep&#xD;
sigh ; greatly as he admired the resignation of his wife, his heart was&#xD;
embittered to think that she should pine in solitude and tears when he&#xD;
was absent from her. The mystery of her grief surpassed his com&#xD;
prehension.&#xD;
" Well, my friend, I'm waiting for you,"quoth the stranger, who&#xD;
had accepted the morning's hospitality-now entering the room.&#xD;
" Oh !" responded Jean, earnestly, " I beg your pardon, comrade&#xD;
upon entering here I found my wife had been crying, which, as you&#xD;
may say, riveted me to the spot."  ,&#xD;
" And why was 'she crying ?" kindly inquired his guest.&#xD;
"She would not tell me," replied Jean, "but I know what it is. She&#xD;
was weeping because it grieves her that we must so soon start upon&#xD;
our journey after work."&#xD;
" But tell ine," interposed the stranger, with unostentatious kind-&#xD;
&#xD;
15&#xD;
&#xD;
14&#xD;
&#xD;
ness, how much money will it require for you to remain here until&#xD;
next summer&#xD;
" A sufficiently large sum," returned Jean ; "in this country the&#xD;
cold lasts a length of time and wood is dear, hence at the commence-&#xD;
ment of the winter we had forty crowns surplus, and to-day I had to&#xD;
sell my gold medallions to celebrate the day of St. Therese-there is&#xD;
no help for it, we must make that sum before the close, of the sum-&#xD;
mer. Well, I must get the jackasses, and then we will go again to&#xD;
work.'&#xD;
As the industrious peasant glided out of the room, in search of the&#xD;
imiplements, the military stranger feeling in his pockets, drew forth&#xD;
some..golden coins,.which, after some hesitation, he slipped into the&#xD;
drawer of a table he noticed standing at the further end of the apart-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
" Forty crowns," he soliloquized, "will afford these poor people a&#xD;
deal of happiness. I do not know of any better use to which I can&#xD;
put this prize money. And who knows, but that this. may again re-&#xD;
turn to the'enemy, whence it has been taken ?"&#xD;
" Come, comrade," quoth the Savoyard returning with a couple of&#xD;
pick-axes upon his shoulder, " take this one. Come, I will now show&#xD;
you the rocky mountain which you must turn to find the rdute to&#xD;
Suze." Opening the door he continued to the guest who had now&#xD;
shouldered one of the implements," do you see that bunch of stunted&#xD;
trees beneath the heavy cloud ?"&#xD;
" Yes, I perceive them," responded his companion.&#xD;
"Come, the other landmarks can only be seen from the broad&#xD;
meadow land," resumed the Guide, as they both passed the door.&#xD;
No sooner had Jean Claude and his companion departed for the&#xD;
meadows than the Italian nobleman retraced his steps to continue his&#xD;
interview with Genevieve. Luidgi had encountered more obstacles in&#xD;
his mission than he had calculated upon. The obstinacy of the young&#xD;
wife, her affectionate adherence to her marital duties, her determined&#xD;
self-sacrifice not only annoyed, but absolutely disconcerted him.&#xD;
However he thought, upon mature reflection, that her reason might&#xD;
be convinced if it was impossible to excite her cupidity, and therefore&#xD;
he resolved upon again offering further temptations to the unhappy&#xD;
woman. The emissary possessed a strong personal inducement to en-&#xD;
sure the return of Genevieve to zer relatives. A-banished outlaw, an&#xD;
exile from Venice, he had been promised by her influential family, a&#xD;
revocation of his banishment, were he to succeed in his attempted&#xD;
restoration of the girl: and this consideration of his individual advan-&#xD;
tages stimulated a renewal of his project, after her first and decisive&#xD;
refusal to accompany him.&#xD;
While engaged in his meditations, he was disturbed by the heavy&#xD;
fall of rain. Going to the door he perceived two men running at full&#xD;
speed to gain shelter beneath the roof. Trembling to be seen to&#xD;
emerge from the chalet, and dreading to encounter the husband of&#xD;
Genevieve, the Italian determined npon hiding himself in one of the&#xD;
adjoining apartments, until the cessation of the storm would -again&#xD;

&#xD;
allow him to seek a conversation with Genevieve, after the departure&#xD;
of her husband.&#xD;
The Venetian had scarce acted upon the1suggestion of his naturally&#xD;
ingenious mind when the Guide and his guest entered the cottage tol-&#xD;
erably drenched by the passing storm.&#xD;
" What weather !" exclaimed the hardy Savoyard'&#xD;
"Hail, rain and tempest," quoth the stranger.&#xD;
" The rain enters even here, Iet's shut the door," responded Jean&#xD;
Claude, closing the only outlet to the building, which precluded any&#xD;
possibility of retreat for the Italian.&#xD;
"It won't last long, for I saw the blue sky by the side of the vine&#xD;
yards," remarked the Guide, "besides it will give us time to rest our-&#xD;
selves-so take a seat, comrade."&#xD;
The guest readily acquiesced in his wishes.&#xD;
" Well, now what shall we do ?" resumed Jean ; " by the way, you&#xD;
know how to read ?"&#xD;
" Yes, but what then ?" returned the guest.&#xD;
" Read to me again about the French victory," replied the Guide.&#xD;
" Willingly, what have you done with the bulletin ?" inquired the&#xD;
stranger.&#xD;
" I'm hunting after it," remarked Jean, turning over the valise&#xD;
upon the table-" hold, this Italian Luidgi has not come back. Don't&#xD;
lose your patience while 1 look for the paper."&#xD;
"But why do you love the French ?" inquired the stranger.&#xD;
"Because," replied the Guide, continuing his search, " I am French&#xD;
-my parents came from Chambery, but I was born at Saint Genis ;&#xD;
beyond the Rhine-I am.Swiss; still I come from the right side-the&#xD;
French side. Where can Genevieve have put that paper?  Perhaps&#xD;
in this drawer. What's this ?" he continued, as he opened the drawer&#xD;
and perceived money in it-" how came this money here ?"&#xD;
"The discovery is premature," thought the stranger.&#xD;
" What can this mean ?" resumed Jean, greatly perplexed. " The&#xD;
traveller who was here in our absence, has probably entrusted Gene-&#xD;
vieve with this money. She said nothing to me about it, and I will&#xD;
go question her about it."&#xD;
" No! that is useless," replied his guest.&#xD;
" Still--" urged Jean, pacing towards her chamber.&#xD;
" I know where the money came from," resumed the stranger, "for&#xD;
it was I who put it in your drawer."&#xD;
" You !" exclaimed the Savoyard, with evident perplexity.&#xD;
" Yes, my friend," rejoined the unknown ; " still I hoped you would&#xD;
not discover it til after my departure, when you could have.disposed&#xD;
of it without regret. As for me, I am a soldier, and in my trade you&#xD;
you know victory pays when the cannon regulates our accounts.&#xD;
Thus I had money-which you had need of, when I had none-that&#xD;
explains everything."&#xD;
"Your actions betray an excellent heart," quoth the Guide, moved&#xD;
at the generosity of his guest, " they are worthy of a soldier-still 1&#xD;
must frankly tell you that I cannot accept your money."&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ALPINE GUIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
17&#xD;
&#xD;
" And why noti?" earnestly inquired the stranger.&#xD;
"Neither would Genevieve accept it," continued Jean, "for we&#xD;
have done nothing to earn it."&#xD;
"But yesterday, you saved my life," rejoined the stranger; " with-&#xD;
out you---"&#xD;
'"Oh !" interrupted the Guide, bluntly, " those things are nothing&#xD;
in our mountains. He who is set aright in his road, says thankee,&#xD;
and he who has befriended him trusts to a return of the good on some&#xD;
future occasion ; both shake hands, and the matter is ended. There.&#xD;
fore I pray you to take back your money  "&#xD;
" And should I furnish you an opportunity to earn the amount ?"&#xD;
-interposed the soldier.&#xD;
"Ah! that would be a different matter," replied the Guide, dubi-&#xD;
ously--" but how ?"&#xD;
"At first," continued the guest, "it is necessary to know my&#xD;
namne."&#xD;
" Certainly, if we make a bargain," responded Jean.&#xD;
" Then know, that I am General -Roger," said the unknown, con-&#xD;
fidentially.&#xD;
"Vou !" ejaculated Jean, with an outburst of incredulity.&#xD;
"Then," resumed the general, taking no notice of the Guide's sur-&#xD;
prise, " if you must know the reason of my disguise. The general-in-&#xD;
chief is ignorant of the enemy menacing his outposts, and as the route&#xD;
to Suze is closed, the intelligence can only reach him by the paths&#xD;
over Mount Cenis."&#xD;
"The Austrians are in possession of them," replied Jean.&#xD;
" Yes," resumed the gallant Roger, " but as a detachment could not&#xD;
penetrate thither, I thought a single man might be able to pass along&#xD;
unperceived."&#xD;
"I understand," interposed Jean Claude.&#xD;
" It was in attempting to carry out my scheme yesterday," said&#xD;
the general, "that I lost my way ; and I am afraid of going, astray&#xD;
again. Consent to guide me, and soon General Bonaparte, warned&#xD;
that that the enemy seeks to surround him by means of the route of&#xD;
Sule, instead of exposing himself to a dubious conflict, will retire to&#xD;
the plain for a pitched battle."&#xD;
"It is perfectly correct," responded the Guide  mechanically.&#xD;
"And when," continued the general-emphatically, "you have aided&#xD;
in avoiding a useless and perilous combat, in which thousands of men&#xD;
would perish, think you not that you have honestly earned your forty&#xD;
crowns ?"&#xD;
" Then," enthusiastically replied Jean Claude, " I would have no&#xD;
longer a fear of their bringing misfortune upon us."&#xD;
"No traveling for your wife," continued Roger, "no more danger&#xD;
for the health of your little one."&#xD;
"We will start," solemnly said the Guide. "The sun is already&#xD;
down ; in an hour the road will be in good-order. Do you swim?"&#xD;
" Yes,"' replied the gallant officer.&#xD;
Then we will cross a little stream," rejoined the Guide, "and&#xD;
thus save two good hours upon the march."&#xD;

" And you trust that by to-morrow-?7" inquired Roger.&#xD;
"We will have gained the bridge St. George," replied Jean firmly.&#xD;
" whence can be seen the French camp."&#xD;
" And may God be with us !" piously ejaculated the general-&#xD;
" Poor Genevieve will await me all night long !" murmured the&#xD;
Guide, as he thought of the kind woman's affection.&#xD;
" Come, we will notify her," rejoined the general, moving towards&#xD;
the stair-way leading to her chamber.&#xD;
" No," quoth Jean, stopping him, gently, "in witnessing her tremble&#xD;
for my safety, I would lose all courage. She must be ignorant of&#xD;
my journey, and I will :goon return and my presence will quickly&#xD;
dispel her inquietude. Let each of us take a staff and forward."&#xD;
" March then," quoth the general gaily.&#xD;
" Oh !  Great God !" suddenly ejaculated the Guide halting in&#xD;
front of the domestic shrine erected to St. Therese.&#xD;
" What ails you ?" tenderly inquired the soldier.&#xD;
"Should 1 never return-" murmured Jean, despondently.&#xD;
" You are afraid !" exclaimed the general.&#xD;
No ! general," replied Jean in a tone of decision, it is my duty&#xD;
-I should strive to gain repose for Genevieve, let us start," then&#xD;
stopping near the door he paused. "Still I think-"&#xD;
"Of what, friend ?" inquired the soldier.&#xD;
" We will take with us the chaplet of grey rock," replied the&#xD;
G-uide as he took the relic frcm the wall and hung it around his neck.&#xD;
"It will protect us against the evil spirits of the mountain. And now&#xD;
to our work !"&#xD;
The Alpine Guide and his brave companion crossed the threshold&#xD;
of the cottage and soon disappeared among the shades of the night,&#xD;
falling fast upon the bleak snow-covered side of the tall mountain,&#xD;
at whose base the little hamlet was situated.&#xD;
The Venetian noble from his hiding place became an involuntary&#xD;
confident of the general's schemes. In order to perfect the designa-&#xD;
tions of the persons, the spy crept out to take a complete view of the&#xD;
departing individuals.  He particularly noted that Claude was&#xD;
clothed in a grey over coat, while his superior companion wore a&#xD;
cape and piedmontese hat- These particulars he treasured in his&#xD;
memory in order to communicate their appearance and intentions&#xD;
inore fullysand especially to the Austrian videttes, who might here&#xD;
fore capture them  with greater certainty. He was well aware that&#xD;
the Austrians spared .no prisoners and therefore was assured that&#xD;
should they fall into the enemies hands both would be massacred and&#xD;
thus the marriage of Genevieve would be annulled. But  before&#xD;
arriving at the final resolution n of their betrayal, he determined upon&#xD;
consulting with Genevieve in the hope that her sober second thoughts&#xD;
would spare him such an alternative. While he was cogitating upon&#xD;
these subjects, Genevieve descended the stair way with a lamp in her&#xD;
hand, as the shades of evening had by this time enveloped the&#xD;
cottage in complete darkness. She placed the lamp on the table&#xD;
,and commenced knitting as the memory of Jean recurred to b - -&#xD;
&#xD;
aggrated the suspense and anxiety in which she was placed. A&#xD;
sudden noise revealed to her the presence of the Italian traveller.&#xD;
" I have come, Madam," said Luidgi, "to seek after a valise,&#xD;
which, I have forgotten here."&#xD;
"There it is, sir," responded Genevieve pointing to it.&#xD;
" Thanks, madam," replied   the Italian, '1  trust that your&#xD;
,resolution."&#xD;
" Is irrevocable, sir," firmly responded the Dame.&#xD;
" You have not then reflected," continued the stranger, " that&#xD;
your high lineage requires irremedial exigencies ?"&#xD;
"And do you, sir, not believe" that the ties of consanguinity like&#xD;
wise boast theirs ?" retorted Genevieve.&#xD;
" Are you ignorant," continued the Venetian, "that you have no&#xD;
right to renounce a fortune for which you have to render account to&#xD;
your innocent daughter ?"&#xD;
"Have I not moreover to render account to her for the existence&#xD;
of her father ?" inquired the wife of Jean.&#xD;
" Then," reiterated  the Ita!ian, "do  you formally refuse to&#xD;
seperate from Jean Claude ?"&#xD;
" I will never seperate myself," replied the young wife, calmly,&#xD;
"from him, even if he should command the sacrifice."&#xD;
" This is no longer affection," murmured the Venetian, "it is&#xD;
sheer madness. Madame, I withdraw-"&#xD;
The face of Genevieve expressed her joy&#xD;
Still the Italian internally vowed that despite herself she should&#xD;
become both rich and the Marchibness of Ferrara. Halting near the&#xD;
door he added: _"May Heaven grant you repentance."&#xD;
" Heaven is just !" exclaimed Genevieve, exaltedly.&#xD;
" Its will be done ?" solemnly said the Italian as he gained the&#xD;
threshold where tarrying an instant he saluted Genevieve respect-&#xD;
fully and retired into the darkness without,.&#xD;
CHAPTER IV&#xD;
THE GUIDE'S RETURN.&#xD;
IN a little cottage, close beneath the eaves of the village church of&#xD;
Saint Martin, fifteen days after the events we have described sat the&#xD;
disconsolate Petit Pierre. toiling away upon one of those contrivances&#xD;
he was wont to hew for the accommodation of the human 'foot.&#xD;
Upon this occasion Pierre's mechanical skill was evidently at fault,&#xD;
for the result of his labor gave little satisfaction.&#xD;
" Come," he soliloquized, as he gazed upon his sabot, in course of&#xD;
construction, " that is cut down too much,'' then, taking up a pair for&#xD;
the sake of .comparison, he continued: "I have made both for the&#xD;
same foot-there is that clock again, it only wants that bell to put&#xD;
one into alin'famous humor."&#xD;

&#xD;
As the bell rang forth its peal the mechanic dashed the incomplete&#xD;
sabots violently ihs the corner and resumed his meditations even more&#xD;
pensive than before.&#xD;
" That bell torments me now, as greatly as it once gave me pleas-&#xD;
ure," he continued in soliloquy. " It recalls to me the sayings of&#xD;
Jean Claude, who used to tell me, when the wind is fair, the sound of&#xD;
the bell would reach the house as if to say to Genevieve and me,&#xD;
here is Petit Pierre sending us news. Poor Jean Claude, he is no&#xD;
longer at the cottage to hear the sound ! And since he has gone I&#xD;
have lost eating, drinking, sleep and labor-everything gone. I have&#xD;
given my place to another. And, Madame Genevieve is going too.&#xD;
The little house of Jean Claude has no more attractions for me, for&#xD;
her rich relatives are there waiting for her. Poor friend, how hap-&#xD;
py I was to carry her garlands and flowers to the field, but now her&#xD;
rich relatives have brought her trinkets of jewels and of gold, and&#xD;
it appears tc me that when I take some flowers they wither in my&#xD;
hand and die."&#xD;
" Are you the man they call Petit Pierre ?" interruped the Italian,&#xD;
whom we have heretolfore encountered.&#xD;
"Yes," replied the wooden shoemaker, " still there are other peo&#xD;
ple in the country who have the same name."&#xD;
" I come on behalf of Madame Thibaut," resumed the Venetian.&#xD;
""'hat's me, them !" joyfully replied Pierre, " for I was the tried&#xD;
friend of her husband-it must be me."&#xD;
" Yes," returned the Italian, "Madame Thibaut informed me that&#xD;
you dearly loved the unfortunate Jean Claude."&#xD;
" As if he were umy best beloved brother," returned the bell-ringer.&#xD;
" He is now unfortunately dead," rejoined Luidgi.&#xD;
" Shot by the Austrians I" replied Petit Pierre.&#xD;
" He paid dearly," resumed the Venetian, "for his imprudence."&#xD;
" It was not imprudence, but courage," returned Pierre. " He ex-&#xD;
posed himself to earn bread fbr his family. Had he been able to&#xD;
have given his family millions upon his death, he would have prayed&#xD;
the Austrians to have taken his life. You said, sir, you came on be-&#xD;
half of Madame Genevieve ?"&#xD;
" Yes, my friend," replied'the Italian, " as she is coming to hear&#xD;
mass at Saint Martin she begged me to charge Pierre to have two&#xD;
candles in the church, one at the shrine of Saint Mary, the other in&#xD;
that of St. John."&#xD;
" Yes, for Jean Claude," warmly returned the bell-ringer, " the&#xD;
other for Marianne ; you say she will be here at mass ?"&#xD;
" She desires," resumed Luidgi, " before leaving the Savoy that&#xD;
her child should be blessed by the curate of Saint Martin, who ad-&#xD;
ministered to her the rites of baptism."&#xD;
" The baptism !" ejaculated Petit Pierre, " that indeed was a joyous&#xD;
day for us-I was the godfather. I purchased a new suit at the fair&#xD;
of Saint Poins, and a capful of sugar-plums. We could not foresee at&#xD;
that time-but excuse me, sir, I hasten to complete the mission of&#xD;
Genevieve."&#xD;

&#xD;
While the mechanic was absent, the Italian paced the floor in a state&#xD;
of nervousness, as he meditated upon the success of his schemes.  -&#xD;
"Eight days ago," he soliloquized semi-audibly, ,"the cousin of&#xD;
Maria Loredan, faithful to his promises, has brought me a revocation&#xD;
of my order of exile, and I, who burn to return to Venice, I must&#xD;
follow to Milan, the heiress of the Loredans. Thus circumstances&#xD;
change resolutions. I -remarked to-day that Maria Loredan must&#xD;
contract a new marriage to forget the name of Jean Thibaut;' I am&#xD;
the- Count d'Arezzo-I am still young ; 1 and her relatives are alone&#xD;
aware of the will of the Count d'Este, and the past history of Gene-&#xD;
vieve, beside I am almost one of the family. A few months have&#xD;
scarce elapsed, since, ruined at gaining, and exiled from Venice, I would&#xD;
have yielded in despair. To-day I dream of realizing a fortune !&#xD;
Crazy indeed not to foresee and mould his fortune, a man is but a&#xD;
grain of sand, and chance is the unforseen wind which carries us&#xD;
along."&#xD;
"The candles are burning on the altar, and the curate awaits to&#xD;
perform mass," announced Petit Pierre reappearing.&#xD;
" Good, my dear fellow," returned Arezzo, " Madame Genevieve&#xD;
must be near by, I must precede her-so console yourself."&#xD;
" That is impossible," quoth Pierre.&#xD;
" Time will come to your aid," resumed the Venetian.&#xD;
" So every one says," tranquilly remarked the bell-ringer.&#xD;
" I should go to the mass," meditated the Savoyard after the de-&#xD;
parture of the Italian, " but I have no courage to gaze upon poor&#xD;
Genevieve in her black garments. No, I will go to the pond and try'&#xD;
my shrimping net; it will kill time somehow."&#xD;
As Petit Pierre took down his piscatorial implements, he heard the&#xD;
voice of Jean Claude on the outside summoning him by name, dis-&#xD;
tinctly and repeatedly.&#xD;
" Holy Virgin !" ejaculated the terrified bell-ringer, "1 hear a voice&#xD;
-am I haunted by evil spirits ?"&#xD;
" There is some one at home," murmured the Alpine Guide, as he&#xD;
entered the cottage. Then noticing Pierre he saluted him:&#xD;
" Ho ! have you grown deaf during the past month, ho ! Pierrot ?"&#xD;
" Jean Claude !" ejaclated Pierre. " Is that you?"&#xD;
" It is me !"' responded the Guide.&#xD;
"Then the Austrians have not killed you ?" inquired Pierre.&#xD;
"Not quite," responded Jean, " they thought they did and I too."&#xD;
"What! not dead !" again exclaimed the astounded Pierre.&#xD;
" Why no !" replied the Guide, "here I am solid flesh and blood?&#xD;
"«Hurrah ! my old Jean Claude," shouted Pierre, tossing his cap&#xD;
into the air and then rushing into the arms of his friend.&#xD;
"Now tell me, how is everybody--Genevieve-my child ?" in-&#xD;
quired Jean, as the enthusiasm of Pierre subsided.&#xD;
" Genevieve," Pierre replied in hesitation.&#xD;
" Well ?" nervously reiterated the Guide.&#xD;
" Fifteen days ago, the poor woman assumed mourning for you,"&#xD;
re sponded Petit Pierre agitatedly.&#xD;

" Poor Genevieve !" muttered her husband," how she must have&#xD;
suffered !"&#xD;
"I thought she would have died," continued Pierre, " had it not&#xD;
been for the sake of her darling daughter."&#xD;
" I was well assured," returned the Guide, " that here you would&#xD;
grieve for poor Jean Claude."&#xD;
"And we found your coat, pierced with fifteen balls," quoth Pierre.&#xD;
" Alas, my friend," mournfully responded the Guide, as a tear&#xD;
dropped from his eye, " I loaned it to general Roger who had lost his&#xD;
in the briars of the ravine, and he wore it when upon nearing the&#xD;
valley we were captured by the Austrians. We had been betrayed,&#xD;
Pierre, some one had given particulars concerning us as they admit-&#xD;
ted."&#xD;
"Who could it have been ?" murmured Pierre.&#xD;
" I have no doubt," resumed Jean, '- but that the spy was concealed;&#xD;
in my house."&#xD;
"That may be possible," replied Pierre, meditatingly, "for upon&#xD;
the night of your departure, as I arrived at your house---"&#xD;
" Well ?"' nervously interrupted the Guide.&#xD;
" I observed a stranger come out," returned the bell-ringer, " and&#xD;
Genevieve told me that it was a Venitian who had returned to seek&#xD;
after   "&#xD;
" A valise he had forgotten !" ejaculated Jean Claude.&#xD;
" Precisely," returned Pierre..&#xD;
" It was he then !" savagely spoke forth the Guide, the blackness of&#xD;
of this treachery in violating the sanctity of Alpine hospitality recur-&#xD;
ring forcibly to his mind, " this wretch ! and you would know him&#xD;
again. Well, the Austrians commenced an assault, and after-havina&#xD;
trampled us into the dust, they allowed us but five minutes to pray to&#xD;
God. The general asked as a favor of the Austrian chief to tell him&#xD;
whether we were betrayed by a'-Frenchman-the chief answered us&#xD;
it was by a Venitian&#xD;
" It was that fellow !' firmly rreiterated Pierre.&#xD;
"A smile of consolation," continued the Guide, "reanimated the&#xD;
veteran's face ; the general gave the command himself, and he fell to&#xD;
the earth dying like a brave man as he was."&#xD;
" And you saw all," marvelled Pierre, " you, Jean Claude ?"&#xD;
" Yes, Pierre," resumed the Guide, " while awaiting my turn ;&#xD;
whilst I was praying, I heard a great cry and confusion above my&#xD;
head.",&#xD;
"What was that ?" inquired the tremulous Pierre.&#xD;
" Oh ! Heavens !" replied Claude in tones of grateful thanksgiving,&#xD;
"it was the French, alarmed by the noise of the fusillade."&#xD;
" Ah ! ah ! ah !" shouted Pierre in triumphant excitement.&#xD;
" Oh, my friend," continued the Guide graphically, "had you only&#xD;
seen them-they fell upon the Austrians like anl avalanche. You&#xD;
would have said that the mountain was on fire-it sounded deeper&#xD;
even than thunder--it was more beautiful than the tempest-when&#xD;

found myself in the French camp where they had carried me; a sur-&#xD;
geon extracted from my wound a ball penetrating to my heart, and&#xD;
they told me that the brave General Bonaparte could not restrain a&#xD;
tear when he learned of the massacre of gallant general Roger."&#xD;
" And what became of the Venitian traitor ?" inquired Pierre.&#xD;
"They are searching for him even now," replied the Guide, " I told&#xD;
them truly that [ had seen the name of Luidgi upon the valise, but&#xD;
this appears to be but a baptismal name. At the end of fifteen days&#xD;
I was cured : I h-id regained my strength when a great man of the&#xD;
army, whom they called Massena, asked me whether I would not con-&#xD;
tinue in the wars, but I thought of Genevieve, of my child, of you,&#xD;
Pierre, and I started for home. For two days I ran the entire dis-&#xD;
tance ; I had just turned the border of the great lake, when I heard'&#xD;
the bell of Saint Martin-; then I said to myself, there is little Pierre&#xD;
calling me, and instead of following my straight road, I turned off&#xD;
into the cross roads, and here I am. Now that I have seen you, em-&#xD;
braced you---I must hurry to console Genevieve and nurse the baby in&#xD;
may arms, while they weep or laugh at seeing me safe and sound."&#xD;
" Stop," interrupted Petit Pierre, as the Guide was about hurriedly&#xD;
to quit the habitation, " first you must know something."&#xD;
Well, what is it ?" inquired Jean, returning to his companion.&#xD;
" I must tell you," resumed the bell-ringer, "or rather you know&#xD;
that when the dead come to life they will see great changes. There&#xD;
have been wonderful things here sinee you have gone."&#xD;
"What are they ?" inquired the Guide, with a presentiment of evil.&#xD;
" Then listento me with all your ears,"continued the peasant.&#xD;
" Iam listening," said Jean Claude, nervously.&#xD;
"Then you know," stammered forth Pierre, "or' rather, you don't&#xD;
know, that Genevieve has been discovered by her family."&#xD;
"Can that be so ?' murmured the perplexed Savoyard.&#xD;
" Yes, my friend," proceeded the mechanic, "her father and mo-&#xD;
ther were Italian nobles, dead long ago, but an uncle remained to her,&#xD;
who found the pearl necklace" of her infancy-and the jeweller at&#xD;
Chambery, whom they questioned, told them all--  "&#xD;
"And then " inquired the Guide in breathless.&#xD;
" The uncle, who had no children, died last month, and left all his&#xD;
property to Genevieve."&#xD;
" Can it be true ?" musingly muttered Jean Claude.&#xD;
" And they say," stammered forth the bell-ringer, "that she is the&#xD;
richest lady in Ferrara-a countess or a marchioness -"&#xD;
" A marchioness 1" exclaimed the astounded Guide.&#xD;
"Still there is a condition," hesitating proceeded Pierre, "a con&#xD;
dition attached to the will, that-"&#xD;
" She leaves me-me, Jean Claude ?" anxiously interposed the-&#xD;
Guide.&#xD;
"Hdow know you that ?" inquired the astounded bell-ringer.&#xD;
" Heaven told me that in advance," responded the disconsolate&#xD;
Jean throwing himself upon a rude bench. "Yes, ever since Gene-&#xD;
vieve has been my wife, I have a presentiment of some misfor-m'ii&#xD;
like this. And Genevieve knows all this ?"&#xD;

"She knew it well before your departure." replied Petit Pierre.&#xD;
" How was that ?" inquired Jean Claude.&#xD;
" Yes," rejoined the bell-ringer, " they came while you were from&#xD;
home; they brought her the will; they advised her to leave; still&#xD;
Genevieve had but one answer :-' I am,' she said, 'the adopted&#xD;
daughter of Dame Marianne, and the wife of Jean Claude ; without&#xD;
him I would perish in a palace-with him I could live in a humble&#xD;
cottage ; his affection is my wealth, and I will not barter happiness&#xD;
for gold-go therefore and return no more." '&#xD;
" And thus spoke she ?" enthusiastically exclaimed the Guide.&#xD;
" But they persisted in coming back," continued Pierre, "and&#xD;
Genevieve begged us to go hide ourselves until your return. But&#xD;
you came not, and when we found the fragments of youi- coat in the&#xD;
valley and they told us the general and Jean, his Guide, had been&#xD;
shot-the cousins of Genevieve brought the news-they came again&#xD;
to carry her hence."&#xD;
" And still they came," murmured the disconsolate husband.&#xD;
" Yes," proceeded Pierre in his narration, " because death dissolves&#xD;
all marriages. They found the poor woman pale and ill; but these&#xD;
people, who have their carriages, soon sent for a physician from&#xD;
Chambery, who has restored her to health. Yes, Jean Claude, these&#xD;
are the wonderful things which have happened since your departure.&#xD;
But God be praised ! Jean Claude still lives, and Genevieve will re-&#xD;
sume her distaff; remain with us, send away the rich relatives and&#xD;
the great legacy. We will talk no further on the subject."&#xD;
The Guide was lost in deep meditation, and apparently turned a&#xD;
deaf ear to the consolations of his kind and honest friend.'&#xD;
" I wished," resumed the bell-ringer, advancing kindly to his silent&#xD;
comrade, "that you should know everything before reaching the cot-&#xD;
tage, and now if you wish it, I will accompany you-yes, let us go&#xD;
forth together-come, let us go, 1 say-"&#xD;
Pierre !" said Jean Claude, recovering his former resolution, as&#xD;
he arose and extended his hand to his faithful companion, " farewell,&#xD;
Pierre, farewell forever !"&#xD;
Where are you going ?" inquired the peasant warmly.&#xD;
"To rejoin the army ; to mingle agam amid the roaring cannon-&#xD;
farewell !"&#xD;
"Jean Claude !" exclaimed Pierre, attempting to restrain him.&#xD;
"Now do you not see," quoth the Guide, his speech growing more&#xD;
and more animated as he continued, "that I am one too many in. the&#xD;
world?  Can I reappear unto Genevieve?  Can I deprive her of a&#xD;
fortune and perchance of life, to reduce her to poverty and labor,&#xD;
which will now cause her death-"&#xD;
"Still!" vairly interposed the bell-ringer.&#xD;
" And were that wound," continued Jean in a melancholic strain,&#xD;
" which I have received, to open again ; were I unable to toil with&#xD;
my arms-would [ then behold Genevieve, a discarded heiress, scrape&#xD;
the ground to nourish me ?"&#xD;
" But the fact is, that-you are thoroughly cured," added Pierre, by&#xD;
way of explanation,&#xD;
&#xD;
" I am not sure of it,' responded the Guide. " The snow and hail,&#xD;
the storms of heaven, may again be a scourge to us. And think you&#xD;
that to-day, after Genevieve has seen a fortune disappear before her,&#xD;
I could say to her: 'Come, wife, put the child upon your back, the-&#xD;
timres are hard, but the world is large ; come, let us find some means&#xD;
of gaining a morsel of bread.'-No ? that would be impossible,&#xD;
Pierre-in returning to my mother's house, I will experience nothing&#xD;
but cold and hunger, misery and pain-"&#xD;
"And who told you that riches will bring happiness to Genevieve ?"&#xD;
shrewdly interposed Pierre. " Do you think, then, with a house full&#xD;
of gold she can buy a friendship like thine ?"&#xD;
" Oh ! no ! no !" muttered the Guide.&#xD;
" Thou knowest well, contentment surpasses wealth," resumed the&#xD;
argumentative manufacturer of wooden shoes.&#xD;
" It is true, Pierre; you are right," responded Jean.&#xD;
S" Come then, Jean Claude," entreated the bell-ringer, " let us go&#xD;
and seek Genevieve once again."&#xD;
"Still," hesitatingly replied the Guide, "if 1 make my reappearance,&#xD;
her fortune will be sacrificed !"&#xD;
" What will that signify-?" remonstrated Pierre.&#xD;
" And then if our poor child, who is not strong," resumed Jean, in&#xD;
depth of meditation, "should chance to die, perchance, Genevieve, as&#xD;
she laid it in the cold ground, would mourn in silence that we had not&#xD;
wealth to have saved her. Then I would be guilty of a crime in&#xD;
causing her murder-better for me to die like a brave man with the&#xD;
battle cry of France upon my lips-farewell."&#xD;
Await for me, then," resolutely responded his comrade, "I will&#xD;
accompany you hence, yes, a long way hence-and perhaps you will&#xD;
change your ideas."&#xD;
" Come !" reiterated the Guide.&#xD;
"Wait !" whispered Pierre, as he opened the door.&#xD;
"Why so?" inquired Jean.&#xD;
"Genevieve is coming,ouutof church," replied the bell-ringer.&#xD;
" Genevieve !" exclaimed the Guide.&#xD;
"She has been to church to hear mass," rejoined Pierre, " and per-&#xD;
haps'she will come in here."&#xD;
"In heaven's name !" ejaculated Jean Claude, "conceal me."&#xD;
" And whatever happens," continued Jean, " do not speak to me."&#xD;
"Not a word !" said the bell-ringer, as he closed the door upon&#xD;
him, " I will not say I have seen you. Now, Holy Saints, guard us!"&#xD;

GENEvEvE entered the room, pale, trembling and careworn. She&#xD;
was modestly attired in deep mourning, and the grief of her heart&#xD;
seemed indelibly printed upon her beautiful countenance.&#xD;
" Good day," she said, advancing in a most friendly manner to the&#xD;

" Ah, Madame Genevieve !" quoth the humble artizan, " you have&#xD;

" Madame," responded the peasant, " I am at your service."&#xD;
At first, my friend," quoth the lady, taking a seat upon a stool,&#xD;
"it is necessary for me to bid you a long farewell."&#xD;
" You leave us then ?" inquired Pierre.&#xD;
"It is necessary," returned Genevieve. " My relatives inform me&#xD;
that I should appear at Naples to assure possession of the inheritance&#xD;
to which misfor tune gives me title. I have no longer Jean Claude,&#xD;
whose labor gave me a living. I am now compelled to accept a large&#xD;
fortune to guarantee my daughter against misery, which alone I could&#xD;
buffet. I am about to yield up to the curate of Saint Martin the four&#xD;
acres of heather land to aid in the relief of the poor-and I bring)&#xD;
you, my friend, the forty crowns for which your poor companion lost&#xD;
his life."&#xD;
" To me, Genevieve ?" tremulously inquired Pierre, as the weeping,&#xD;
Dame placed in his hand a leather purse, containing the coin.&#xD;
"You will not refuse," reiterated Genevieve, giving vent to her&#xD;
sad emotions by a copious flood of tears. " It is your share of the&#xD;
inheritance and a souvenir of your best friend."&#xD;
" Thousand thanks !" gratefully replied the bell-ringer.&#xD;
" The money will be well spent, but keep the purse-it was his&#xD;
travelling purse for many a year," sadly rejoined Genevieve, arising&#xD;
from her seat and placing a key in his hand: "Here is the key to the&#xD;
cottage of Jcan Claude. Be the master and guardian of it; and if&#xD;
you desire to inherit it-"&#xD;
"Oh, no !" warmly responded Pierre, " I could not think of living.&#xD;
there without you, without him. No, wealth has closed the poor&#xD;
cottage for a long while to come."&#xD;
"May heaven grant that the wealth which has cost me such a&#xD;
pang," resumed the still weeping lady, " will aid me in preserving my&#xD;
sole treasure-my dear daughter. Did you only know, my friend,&#xD;
how much during the absence of Jean Claude,'I have held her, either&#xD;
burning or cold from fever upon my knees ; how many times I have&#xD;
prayed God, and God heard my prayers, that her ills would cease be-&#xD;
&#xD;
fore the return of her father, to whom I have never whispered con-&#xD;
cerning the past afflictions, for my child was the mainspring of my&#xD;
life. Poor Jean Claude, Heaven knows that had he lived, I would&#xD;
have labored for his happiness." The lady sighed deeply and wiped&#xD;
the tears from her eyes.&#xD;
" I'm almost tempted to call Jean Claude," murmured the bell-ringer&#xD;
to himself, touched at the sincerity of the poor wife.&#xD;
And during my sorrows, Pierre," continued the Dame, "I'have&#xD;
a shadow of consolation in his being able from on high to say to him-&#xD;
self as he sees her growing up : Genevieve can now protect our child&#xD;
from the blasts of autumn, the snows of winter, and she will grow to&#xD;
womanhood beneath a genial sun."&#xD;
" Still I dare not summon Jean," ruminated Petit Pierre.&#xD;
" Farewell, Pierre," said the lady, shaking her friend warmly by&#xD;
the hand ; "you can still say that Rich Genevieve of Farrara will always&#xD;
be considered as a valuable friend."&#xD;
" You are too good, Madame," gratefully replied the peasant," and I&#xD;
shall ever love you truly ; still I would be unable to live among the&#xD;
great people, who summon you to them; I could only compare my-&#xD;
self to a thistle among the flowers of a garden.&#xD;
" In the valley it may bloom unnoticed, but among dIinty plants&#xD;
never !. But how long before you start upon your journey 'C&#xD;
"In an hour, perhaps," returned the lady "andl now farewell and&#xD;
may your life be a successful and a happy one."&#xD;
Madame Thibaut extended her hand to 'the humble friend of her&#xD;
infancy, who pressed it to his lips and bedewed it with his tears. The&#xD;
poor fellow, warned as he had been by the reapparition of his ancient&#xD;
comrade, viewed .the departure of Genevieve as a personal calamity&#xD;
embittering the casual comfort of his bleak aad solitary existence,&#xD;
with stammering accents he mumbled forth an affectionate, heart-felt&#xD;
farewell.&#xD;
No, sooner had Genevieve quitted the apartment than the Guide&#xD;
stepped cautiously frei his place of concealment as if to catch- a&#xD;
glance of his wife's retreating form.&#xD;
"Now," murmured Jean Claude addressing his, companion, " you&#xD;
must understand why 1 am one too many in this world."&#xD;
" Yes," stammered Pierre-" that is so !-you must not be in a&#xD;
hurry-there must be some time for reflection."&#xD;
" She will take the child to some more genial clime," quoth the&#xD;
Guide, pacing the apartment nervously. " Now. then will 1 have&#xD;
courage to face the brunt of battle-I can willingly die of my&#xD;
wounds !-Thanks to heaven, that before closing my eyes in death;&#xD;
I have seen them on the road to a happy future. ' Come, let us start,&#xD;
Pierre, my head burns and 1 must hasten-"&#xD;
At this'momeint the bell of Saint Martin commenced ringing for&#xD;
the close of service.&#xD;
" hold !" exclaimed the bell ringer, " the bell announces the close&#xD;
A mass-church is coming out-Genevieve will pass the house."&#xD;
But should she enter," interposed Jean tremulously.&#xD;

" I will bolt the door," rejoined Pierre, suiting the action to the&#xD;
word by forcing the bolt. " She will think that I have gone out-&#xD;
now perfect silence until the bell ceases."&#xD;
" Could I but see her for the last time," murmured Jean.&#xD;
Shall I draw the bolt ?" insinuated Petit Pierre.&#xD;
"No !" firmly responded the Guide, designating with his finger a&#xD;
lateral window opening upon the street. " I see the people upon the&#xD;
road way, strangers-they are her rich relatives-yes Genevieve is&#xD;
among them bearing my child-my little Jean, my only treasure !.&#xD;
Yes, they bear away my child, my everything !" still he added in&#xD;
perfect delirium: " they cannot rob a father of'his daughter's love."&#xD;
"No!" composedly responded Pierre.&#xD;
" It'is-a sacrifice," continued Jean, " perchance repugnant to the will&#xD;
of God, on high."&#xD;
" Yes, repugnant to the will of God !" repeated Pierre, "certainly&#xD;
it is,-l will go call Genevieve."&#xD;
"No !" firmly responded the Guide, " I would seek her myself,&#xD;
still-were I to be assassin of my child !-is my brain turned, or&#xD;
has my wound re-opened-I feel my head swim-my breath fails&#xD;
me.-Oh ! Pierre, you know not what sorrow is concealed within&#xD;
my heart."&#xD;
The Guide fell overpowered with grief and sorrow upon the breast&#xD;
of his ancient comrade, and shed his tears freely, as the bell continued&#xD;
to ring forth the closing chimes of the service.&#xD;
CHAPTER            VI.&#xD;
THE HOUSEHOLD SPY.&#xD;
EIGHTEEN years elapsed after the departure of Genevieve from&#xD;
her mountain cottage of the Savoy.   Many serious changes had&#xD;
transpired'during that period of time, and the general, for whose&#xD;
relief' Claude the Guide had ventured his existence was hailed as the&#xD;
great Emperor of martial France.&#xD;
It was, therefore, in the year 1813, that the domestics of a newly&#xD;
decorated mansion in the Rue de Verneil were lounging out of the&#xD;
windows to catch a glimpse of the imperial cortege, as it defiled&#xD;
through the Rue de Bac. One by one curiosity impelled them to&#xD;
desert their labors so that the main saloon of the mansion was&#xD;
deserted by all save one, who, availing himself of the absence of his&#xD;
master, was about to imitate their example when he discovered his&#xD;
exit precluded by the entrance of a gentleman of middle ,age,&#xD;
costumed with the taste and brilliancy distinguishing the new born&#xD;
aristocracy of that period.&#xD;
" Simon," said the incomer, as he almost jostled against the&#xD;
domestic, who was about passing out, "are you here alone ?"&#xD;
" Yes, Monsieur Morel," respectfully returned the servant.&#xD;
&#xD;
29&#xD;
&#xD;
"4Well, ray boy," familiarly quoth the gentleman as he closed the&#xD;
door cautiously and advanced to the domestic, " you have not forgot-&#xD;
ten that two months ago when I placed you in the house hold of the&#xD;
Count d' Arezzo, 1 promised you-"&#xD;
" That y ou would double my wages," interposed the affable&#xD;
Simon.&#xD;
" Upon condition.-"    "That I would inform you of everything&#xD;
transpiring here," replied Simon, with signal effrontery of manner.&#xD;
"There are two Napoleons," continued Morel, throwing to him&#xD;
two glittering pieces of gold.&#xD;
Thanks, sir," replied Simon; " now for your questions."&#xD;
"First," resumed Morel, " where is the Count ?"&#xD;
 He is undoubtedly at the Treasury," answered the domestic,&#xD;
where his duties as Treasurer of the Venetian contributions should&#xD;
demand his presence."'&#xD;
" No.   I have come from   the Treasury," said the gentleman.&#xD;
Has he gone out for the night?'.&#xD;
"Yes," replied Simon, pointing to a mask, which lay. upon a piece&#xD;
of furniture ; " probably he has gone to the masked ball at Frascati's.&#xD;
I found this mask and cloak in the room early this morning."&#xD;
" A masked ball !" meditated the gentleman ; "he would not miss&#xD;
one of the fetes of Frascati-he gambles heavily." Then he contin-&#xD;
ued aloud. " And the Countess ?"&#xD;
"Has gone out;" replied the servant ; "Mademoiselle Jane remains&#xD;
alone in the -hotel."&#xD;
" Is there a continual dispute as to her marriage ?" continued Mo-&#xD;
rel with an air of nonchalance.&#xD;
More than ever," continued the confidential spy, " although we&#xD;
do not hear much about it."&#xD;
"Perhaps," interrupted the visitor, " The Count and Countess have&#xD;
had an explanation ?"&#xD;
'No," responded Simon, "the Countess will come to no under-&#xD;
standin~g with her husband."&#xD;
".He still persists in witholding his consent," remarked Morel.&#xD;
" It. may be deferred until Mademoiselle Jane attains her majority,"&#xD;
observed the well instructed Simon.&#xD;
Oh, but that is far distant," continued the gentleman.&#xD;
"She will be of age in ten days," quoth Simon correcting him.&#xD;
"She will be of age in ten days," said Morel, reflectingly ; "are&#xD;
you sure of that ?"&#xD;
." I can assure y ou," observed the domestic confidentially, "that&#xD;
Mademoiselle Jine attains her legal majority."&#xD;
He will probably then demand all accounts, due during her&#xD;
minority," remarked Monsieur Morel.&#xD;
"That is a natural consequence," said Simon.&#xD;
" Who has told you all this ?" inquired the gentleman.&#xD;
" No one," responded Sinon, shrewdly. , " A  domestic, troubled&#xD;
with curiosity, learns everything naturally ; a word on one side ; nd a&#xD;
hint on the other, an intercepted letter-in a word you pay me  or&#xD;
information; ;  pick it up-I inltruet you."'&#xD;

" I have not a moment to lose," resumed Monsieur Morel, "it is&#xD;
necessary for me to see the Count this very day."&#xD;
Will you wait for him ?" inquired Simon.&#xD;
" No! I have two calls to make," returned the visitor ; "at what&#xD;
hour is it probable he will be here ?"&#xD;
" I cannot say," replied the domestic ; " often when we believed&#xD;
'aim at a distance, lie is in this very chamber: I sometimes believe he&#xD;
-'ones through the walls.".&#xD;
" I must make haste," observed the visitor. When near the room&#xD;
Joor he suddenly stopped ; " Is there a cab-stand here ?"&#xD;
" In the Rue de Bac," replied Simon.&#xD;
"Thank you," rejoined Morel; " when I return, let me in."  " Let&#xD;
you in," responded Simon in a hesitating manner, " that was not&#xD;
-rieed upon."&#xD;
" I will treble your wages," quoth Morel, taking his departure&#xD;
hastily.&#xD;
"Is that man the friend or the enemy of the Count de Arezzo ?"&#xD;
soliloquized Simon as he watched the gentleman leaving the apart-&#xD;
nent. " Is he a debtor or a creditor ?  In faith, he can be one or&#xD;
the other, provided he does not pass counterfeit money. . A carriage&#xD;
at the door !" lie continued, as he went to look out the window&#xD;
" the Count, perhaps; no, the -chariot of the Countess. And I have&#xD;
forgotten to deliver to Mademoiselle Jane the result of the commis-&#xD;
sion she entrusted me with. I must hasten to her."&#xD;
"I was just going to speak to you, Mademoiselle," he continued as&#xD;
a young and lovely woman entered the apartment.&#xD;
" I was out of patience waiting for you," returned the lady.&#xD;
" I have been to the post," replied the domestic ; " there are no let-&#xD;
ters from Italy for the Countess."&#xD;
" He has not written then," murmured the girl to herself, " fifteen&#xD;
days, and without a letter !"&#xD;
"She appears annoyed," musingly observed Simon.&#xD;
"IHenri does not love meas dearly as I love him," quoth the girl&#xD;
to herself.&#xD;
! Is Mademoiselle aware," interposed the cautious Simon, " that&#xD;
her mother, the Countess, has returned to the mansion ?"&#xD;
Think you so l" observed the lady abstractedly.&#xD;
"The horses are already unharnessed," replied the servant.&#xD;
" I was ignorant of it," remarked the young wom an, about to take&#xD;
her departure from the chamber.&#xD;
" Jane," interpo'ed the Countess, entering the room in her carriage&#xD;
costume, "I have been seeking for you everywhere-what are you&#xD;
doing here ?''&#xD;
"I came to ask a question of Simon," modestly responded the fair&#xD;
girl to this inquiry of her still young and handsome mother.&#xD;
" B it what ails y ?" inquired the Countess with an air of solicit-&#xD;
ude, " on have a ,. ressed looking air-has anything unusual oc ur-&#xD;
ed, Simon?"&#xD;
"9Nothing, Mlada ,'&#xD;

" Ilave you seen the Count ?" tenderly inquired the mother. "IHas&#xD;
he been conversing with you ?"&#xD;
No," disconsolately replied the young woman: "still, I have&#xD;
been thinking that fifteen days have elapsed without any news from&#xD;
Italy."&#xD;
An-I that grieves you," reinarked the Countess, as she seated her-&#xD;
elf' upon one of the longires, " my poor child, reassure yourself, dry&#xD;
tip your tears, and dream that Colonel Henri thinks more of you than&#xD;
lie does of himself."&#xD;
'" In the first place," rejoined the daughter, assuming a seat affee-&#xD;
t imnntely by the side of her mother, "that is an impossibility, besides&#xD;
his silence does not prove his love. About an hour ago, I saw a ser-&#xD;
vant come hither with a letter--oh ! how my heart beat, but I was de-&#xD;
Teived. It was  letter from the Marshal's wife, who invites us upon&#xD;
the fifteeitlh of this month to attend the soiree given before her de-&#xD;
parture to the country."&#xD;
"Yes. I am  aware of it,".responded the Countess, "I have just&#xD;
quitted the lady i she will call shortly to take you with her to the&#xD;
chateau."&#xD;
" What ! me !" inquired Jane.&#xD;
'Yes," resumiied the Countess, " to-day there is musical mass in the&#xD;
chapel; the marshal's wife has two places in the gallery reserved for&#xD;
ladies of honor ; one she has placed at your disposal, and will take&#xD;
you in her company. Hence, my child, make all speed, call your&#xD;
waiting-maid, and arrange yourself beautifully-"&#xD;
And you ?" affectionately inquired the fair daughter.&#xD;
I," responded her mother, " will profit of your absence, and en-&#xD;
(lea vor to speak to the Count rationally concerning your marriage."&#xD;
Listen, mother," entreated the beautiful Jaine; " 1 am too heart-sore&#xD;
.to dress myself, and think upon the vanities of fashions. Permit me&#xD;
to write a line thanking the duchess, and suffer me to remain by your&#xD;
side the rest of the day."&#xD;
Should I permit y ou," retorted the Countess, smilingly, " you will&#xD;
repent of it before long."&#xD;
Why ?" sweetly inquired the young lady.&#xD;
" Because I trust youwill see," responded the Countess, "some one&#xD;
at the Chapel, um ho will dissipate your melancholy."&#xD;
" Who ?" anxiously interrupted Jane.&#xD;
" A person arriving from Italy," replied the Countess.&#xD;
"Who brings tidings from Colonel Henri ?" quoth the young girl.&#xD;
"And who knows the reasons," continued her mother, " why he&#xD;
has not written for the last fifteen days."&#xD;
" Who knows the reason !" ejaculated the young lady.&#xD;
" I do," replied the Countess, " because he told it inc."&#xD;
" And you have concealed it from me ?" said Jane.&#xD;
"You gave me no tinmIe to communicate it to you," answered her&#xD;
mothere. "rThe Colonel has not written for the reason that the weari-&#xD;
n'ess of separntion pressed so heavily upon him that he solicited an&#xD;

" Which he has obtained," continued the matron, joyously, " he&#xD;
started for France forthwith, and now he is in Paris."&#xD;
" Henri, here !" ejaculated Jane, drying her tears readily.&#xD;
"Yesterday he was received by the Emperor, and to-day he will&#xD;
be present at the mass in the chateau," quoth the Countess.&#xD;
And is this all true ?" anxiously inquired Jane, almost beside her-&#xD;
self at this joyful revelation, "all you have told me?"&#xD;
Quite true, my child," returned the Countess, " now will you not&#xD;
go and thank the Duchess."&#xD;
"And have you seen him ?' anxiously inquired the fair girl.&#xD;
We have not time to enter into details," affectionately replied her&#xD;
mother, " now hurry and dress yourself."&#xD;
I will not be long for my heart urges me to the task," and with&#xD;
these words the beautiful creature was about to bound out of the&#xD;
room, when she noticed the entrance of the step-father, at whose as&#xD;
peet her joy was suddenly changed into a re-assumption of her pre&#xD;
vious melancholy.&#xD;
"Well, Jane," quoth the Count d'Arezzo, upon his entrance, "you&#xD;
seem to have dropped your good-humor. Are you afraid of me I"&#xD;
No, father," timidly responded the young girl.&#xD;
"In truth," continued the Count, " you almost make me believe it&#xD;
to be so. Preserve your gaiety, my girl, for it suits you admirably,&#xD;
and do not disguise it in my presence, who was but a moment ago&#xD;
thinking of you."&#xD;
" Is it possible, father 7" musingly asked the blooming Jane.&#xD;
" Yes," responded the Count, "1 have just left one of our most&#xD;
wealthy diplomatists who has a son attached to the department of fi&#xD;
dances, and I thought that-&#xD;
" You are well aware, my father," interposed Jane, energetically.&#xD;
that I am promised to Colonel Henri."&#xD;
1 am aware that the Countess, your mother," responded the Count,&#xD;
has been guilty of the weakness of encouraging the hopes of this&#xD;
young man to whom I am a stranger, and I should be much pleased&#xD;
to have a conversation with you upon the subject; will you therefore&#xD;
do me the favor of taking a seat ?      .,,&#xD;
"Jane has it not in her power to comply with your request," inter-&#xD;
rupted the Countess. interposing her person between the speakers.&#xD;
"At this moment the duchess is expected to arrive to convey her&#xD;
to the Chateau."&#xD;
I regret that my daughter can not sacrifice to me.---" resumed&#xD;
the Count.&#xD;
" It is impossible," repeated the Countess, "the duchess will be&#xD;
here, and Jane will be behind time-Go, my child, and haste thee."&#xD;
"Poor mother," musingly whispered the young girl," to leave thee&#xD;
alone to ennui -&#xD;
"Nay, trouble yourself not on my account," affectionately respond-&#xD;
ed her mother " go, be happy, and make haste."&#xD;
The beautiful Jane smiled and quitted the chamber noiselessly.&#xD;

"I fA trusted, Madame " qooth the Count, as he deposited a tnae&#xD;
of documents upon the table, " that in assigning an hour in advance&#xD;
for my daughter, I might havo reckoned upon her attendance."&#xD;
"1 am astonished, that you should solicit, at this hour, an interview&#xD;
ou have avoided for the past six months," proudly retorted the&#xD;
untess.&#xD;
aIt was because I concluded you had resolved to discnntenaime&#xD;
a project of alliance. my silence disapproved of."&#xD;
" And why this silence 7 upon what grounds do you base your di.&#xD;
approbation ?" sternly inquired the Countess.&#xD;
" Upon an interest for Jane's welfare," replied the Count ; '"and&#xD;
therefore it is my duty to resist the dangerous allurement of an affeo-&#xD;
tion which has completely bewildered you."&#xD;
"You are laboring under a delusion, sir," retorted the Countes.&#xD;
"ount happily, Ideem It proper to interpose my prudence," the&#xD;
Count rejoined.&#xD;
" Or rather, your hatred," resumed the lady&#xD;
Hatred ! for whom V' ironically asked the nobleman.&#xD;
"My daughter," solemnly spoke the Countess.&#xD;
" I entertain hatred against her ?" exclaimed the Italian.&#xD;
"You are aware, sir," responded the lady, "that I had, sworn to&#xD;
remain a widow, when the monks of La Concordia contested my in-&#xD;
heritance, after I bad been in possession over two years."&#xD;
" I remember that," nervously added the nobleman.&#xD;
" You should moreover remember," resumed the Countess, "'that I&#xD;
was subsequently informed that you instituted these unjust and illegal&#xD;
proceedings."&#xD;
"It was a calumny !" warmly said the Count.&#xD;
" You are still further aware," proceeded the Countess, energetio.&#xD;
ally, "that the Sovereign Council of Venice, unto whom I had re-&#xD;
coarse, promised me its protection upon the condition of contracting&#xD;
a second marriage with some Italian nobleman, who would becon e&#xD;
at the same time my husband and the adopted father of ay child."&#xD;
"That is all true," remarked the Count.&#xD;
" I had no choice but between the future of my child and of the&#xD;
existence of her father; my duty was plain," continued the Countess,&#xD;
"You were near me, and contrived to take possession of my cond.&#xD;
dence, and when, to preserve the fortune of my daughter, I became&#xD;
your wife, we signed a contract, recognizing the right of Jane to ones&#xD;
half her property, and constituting you her tutor. You even exacted&#xD;
by the same instrument, that this fortune should belong to you,&#xD;
should my daughter chance to die, and I yielded to the emei-gency,&#xD;
for after her loss the world would be valueless to me. From that day&#xD;
you have up to this time surrounded Janie with every care and pre-&#xD;
caution-now you dissimulate no longer-you have thrown off the&#xD;
mask."&#xD;

you not endeavor to separate my child from her mother, and prevent&#xD;
her from following us hither ?"&#xD;
" I would have withdrawn from the Countess d'Arezzo," returned&#xD;
the Italian, " a child which seemed perpetually to recall the name of&#xD;
her former husband, Jean Claude."&#xD;
"The name of Jean Claude Thibaut will always be enshrined in&#xD;
my heart," warmly responded the Countess.&#xD;
"You are welcome to your divinity," sneeringly observed the&#xD;
Count.&#xD;
"Shortly after our arrival in Paris," resumed the Countess, paying&#xD;
no attention to the sarcasm of her husband, " did I not see my poor&#xD;
child fall ill, and speedily decline, overwhelmed by your neglect, and&#xD;
wearied by domestic quarrels of which she was the object?  Did not&#xD;
the most skilful physicians prescribe for her travelling ? Have I not&#xD;
proof that your continued injustice was the cause of her malady, since&#xD;
after a month of calmness and repose, she recovered her health ; and&#xD;
when, after a two-years sojourn in Italy, Jane and I hastened to ob-&#xD;
tain your consent to her marriage with Colonel Henri, whom we knew&#xD;
at Florence, and to whom I pledged my word, have you not for six&#xD;
months placed obstacles in the way of this marriage, without explana-&#xD;
tion of your motives, as if you had a secret pleasure in tormenting&#xD;
Jane, and in anticipating dread of her happiness ? And now, tell me,&#xD;
if you do not hate my daughter, in what way do you show your,&#xD;
love ?"&#xD;
" Madame," responded the Count, with an affectation of calmness,&#xD;
CI cannot reply to accusations, 'vhich can be excused, probably, by&#xD;
the agitation of your mind, for I will not say from your anger, only&#xD;
by averring that it does not suit me to authorize the union of my&#xD;
step-daughter with I know not what young unknown Colonel."&#xD;
"Who bears a name the army venerates," returned the Countess,&#xD;
" for he is the son of General Roger."&#xD;
" I never before heard of that general," resumed d' Arezzo, with a&#xD;
profound affectation of ignorance.&#xD;
" I have already told you," responded the Countess, excitedly,&#xD;
"that General Roger was shot upon Mont Cenis-with Jean rThibaut,&#xD;
the companion in his misfortune. Do yoi not find, sir, that in the&#xD;
union of the children of these two men, murdered in the same cause,&#xD;
can be seen the hand of Providence ?"s&#xD;
"It assuredly is very romantic," replied the Count, "still quite&#xD;
impossible, for I also have a project for the alliance of my daughter."&#xD;
You ?" inquired the Countess.&#xD;
" I desire," returned the Count " that her marriage will connect&#xD;
us more intimately with the Court of France; beside, I have not as&#xD;
yet relinquished my double duties as guardian and tutor."&#xD;
"After having trampled," resumed the afflicted mother, "my poor&#xD;
Jane to the earth by disdain, and indifference for over twelve years,&#xD;

&#xD;
you, at this late period remember that you are her step father,&#xD;
because it suits you to dispose of her at your will, to sacrifice her for&#xD;
some dormant scheme of ambition-Sir ! that would be a crime ?"&#xD;
"Madam, I am astonished !" exclaimed the Italian.&#xD;
"To find in me some resolution !" calmly returned the Countess.&#xD;
In fact, that should  astonish  you.; I have ever been, if not&#xD;
submissive, at least resigned, but my resignation ceases when the&#xD;
future of my child is concerned. On your account, I have seen her a&#xD;
child, weep I have seen her a girl, weep, and on your account, I have&#xD;
no wish to see her, a wife weep ; and therefore -I tell you this&#xD;
marriage shall be accomplished because I believe her happiness, her&#xD;
I fe depends upon it. It is time that Jane should live in consolation,&#xD;
for I have no wish that the shade of Jean Claude, who died for us,&#xD;
shall come to the Countess to inquire what she had done for the&#xD;
existence of the child of Genevieve. And were I, in this struggle&#xD;
against you, to encounter even death-I Swear to you that I will face&#xD;
it without changing color--"&#xD;
You desire then," replied the Count, " War to the knife !"&#xD;
"No, sir," responded, the Countess haughtily, "I merely desire to&#xD;
solicit you- approbation of this marriage."&#xD;
"Never, Madam !" firmly answered the Italian.&#xD;
"Time has devoured space, sir," continued the mother, "in ten&#xD;
days Jane will be of age."&#xD;
"And then '' .nervously inquired the Count.&#xD;
"Free, mistress of her own actions," responded the Countess&#xD;
cal ly, "she will contract a marriage which heaven has blesssed in&#xD;
advance, and institute her return to power by demanding a state-&#xD;
ment of your accounts."&#xD;
"What, madam," exclaimed the Count in consternation, "would&#xD;
you brave scandal fearlessly- I"&#xD;
yo The devotion of a mother to her daughter's welfare," returned&#xD;
the Countess, "can never give rise to scandal-"&#xD;
"In ten days, Madam," resumed the Count, "you will seek to&#xD;
employ a rigorous exercise of right, I will therefore use all means left&#xD;
to me during the ten days to come."&#xD;
The Countess smiled, for she had resolved to remove her daughter&#xD;
from his supervision during the remainder of the period of his legal&#xD;
tutelage of the young and interesting girl.&#xD;
hI desire," continued the Count, " to interrogate my child, in order&#xD;
,hat her disobedience may be removed, then, madam, you can profit by&#xD;
my hatred, for it would be justifiable, still-I am convinced that Jane&#xD;
will recognize -"&#xD;
Force may compel her obedience in a word," returned the matron,&#xD;
"but at heart never.&#xD;
' To-morrow we shall know all," responded the Count.&#xD;
The Countess smiled again, for she had determined that her daughter&#xD;
should be far distant ere the morrow's dawn. Then she continued&#xD;
Yes, Madam," replid the Italian affirmatively.'&#xD;

" Then I will withdraw," haughtily returned the Countess, as she&#xD;
reiterated to herself her determination to send Jane out of the reach&#xD;
of her rapacious and treacherous father-in-law.&#xD;
" I have procrastinated too Long," soliloquized the Venitian as he&#xD;
paced the room in nervous-agitation," I have suffered this explanation&#xD;
to remain until too late-I was a fool for my remissness. If I cannot&#xD;
obtain Jane's consent by persuasion, by intimidation, I must devise&#xD;
some means to procrastinate the marriage. Should she compel me to&#xD;
account for her monies--I will be not only ruined, but absolutely dis-&#xD;
honored. Well ! I have yet ten days to arrange thatters ; ten brief&#xD;
days. Luckily the hero of this adventure is four hundred leagues&#xD;
hence. Let me see, I have friends at Florence, one above all, skilful,&#xD;
intriguing and daring-while I an at work here I will set him in nU-&#xD;
tion at Fiorence-he will introduce himself to the Colonel, quiet his&#xD;
suspicions, allay 1eis doubts, and plant the seeds of revengeful jealousy,&#xD;
while I poison the match here.&#xD;
" Yes," he continued rubbing his hands, and ringing his chamber.&#xD;
bell, "I will write to him, explaining my plan, and give him cause&#xD;
to be interested in our success-"&#xD;
" Did your excellency call I" modestly inquired Simon, who had&#xD;
entered the apartment in answer to the dount's summons.&#xD;
" Yes," replied the Venitian, "let the horses be put up, I shall no&#xD;
go out again."&#xD;
" Certainly, your Excellency," returned the domestic, "but I would&#xD;
inform you-"&#xD;
" What ?" inquired the Count, impatiently.&#xD;
"That Monsieur Morel-" answered the servant.&#xD;
" I cannot receive him," remonstrated the Count, "I have no time&#xD;
at present- "&#xD;
But, sir, he insists upon it," reiterated the servant.- ,'c&#xD;
" Send him away," said the Count, raising his voice to a high pitch&#xD;
--"I cannot--I am too busy-'-'&#xD;
"And. so am I, your Excellence !" Interposed Monsieur Morel, forc-&#xD;
ing his way into the apartment-&#xD;
" He's done it !" murmured Simon, gleefully, as he left the room to&#xD;
indulge in a hearty outburst of laughter at the superlative impudence&#xD;
of the Count's mysterious visitor.&#xD;
CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
AN UNEXPECTED ARR.IVAL.&#xD;
"I a terribly annoyed at disturbing you," quoth Morel, throwing&#xD;
himself into an arm-chair, without awaiting an invitation from the&#xD;
Count, "yet I am enchanted to see you."&#xD;
" What do you want 7" inquired the Count, indulging in a vehement&#xD;
outburst of rage.&#xD;
" Mer~ely to give you notice," replied the visitor, thatt I have de-&#xD;
&#xD;
posited in the bank your note at sight, subscribed to my order, for the&#xD;
sum of one hundred and twelve thousand francs for which you are&#xD;
indebted to me."I,&#xD;
"Well, sir," responded the Count, continuing the composition of&#xD;
a letter, and paying but indifferent attention to his creditor, " you&#xD;
will have the trouble of taking it out of the Bank again, for I cannot&#xD;
at present pay it."&#xD;
"You have the funds," replied Morel, 0 and I can wait no longer."&#xD;
"And why this haste, at this emergency ?" inquired the Count.&#xD;
"Simply while you are absorbed in gaming," answered his visitor&#xD;
leaning over the table, so as to address him in a low tone of voice,&#xD;
" you see not difficulties arising on all sides of you. In ten days&#xD;
Mademoiselle Jane will be of age ; she will make the customary de-&#xD;
mands upon you and after a notice of fifteen days will insist upon&#xD;
her accounts, and as your affairs are disordered I have thought prop-&#xD;
er to claim a preference among creditors."&#xD;
"And then, Monsieur Morel," returned the Cdant arising and lay-&#xD;
ing aside his correspondence, "you believe that I have not forese a&#xD;
this state of matters-that I have provided nothing to guarantee my-&#xD;
self. Such a thought is as outrageous in my case as audacious  p&#xD;
ungrateful in yours."&#xD;
"What are your expectations ?" inqatred Morel.&#xD;
"In the first place, learn," replied the Count, " tlat this marriage&#xD;
cannot be accomplished under six months, if it is at all. Accord rte&#xD;
three months and then-luck will-not forever run against me; this&#xD;
very night my vein of good fortune has commenced. A party of&#xD;
twenty determined gamesters were assembled at Frascati's; we weie&#xD;
afraid of being known, beside the rules allowed masked gambling, I&#xD;
had three thousand napoleons before me when the day broke, and bii.&#xD;
terrupted our game."&#xD;
"Wonderful!" ejaculated Mogi.&#xD;
" Twenty times," continued the Count, " I held the queen oar-d, tIp&#xD;
knave of diamonds."&#xD;
"Twenty times ?" repeated the visitoineredulously.&#xD;
" Yes, twenty times !" reiterated the gamester.&#xD;
"If you could only give me one on account," quoth Mora, exteg'd&#xD;
ing his hand towards the noble,&#xD;
a Pooh ! nonsense," replied the Count," that would appear tjpe&#xD;
confounding you with my contractors."&#xD;
"Well," returned the guest, "I do not mind that."&#xD;
"But," responded the Count, taking his friend's hand, "I have boo&#xD;
high an interest in your case for that. Well, this return of luck will&#xD;
return and last as long as has my want of success. I will moreover&#xD;
have before long other resources to pay you. Agree therefore to an&#xD;
extension of three months and leave me.'&#xD;
The Count conducted his visitor to a door at the further end of the&#xD;
apartment and continued : " I am desirous of finishing an important&#xD;
dispatch for Florence with regard to Colonel Henri."&#xD;
Colonel Henri is in Paris," replied Morel, laying his hand upon&#xD;

the knob of the door, and addressing the Count, who had resumed his-&#xD;
seat at the table and reconmenced his writing.&#xD;
"You are mistaken," remarked the Venitian nobleman.&#xD;
Not at 'all," replied Morel returning to the table. "I am certain&#xD;
of it, I heard of it at the Club. Yesterday he was received by the&#xD;
Emperor, and this morning he was present at the review.&#xD;
"It is evidently an error," resumed the Count obstinately; " The&#xD;
Countess whom I have just seen, would not fail to have informed&#xD;
. . .&#xD;
"She is either ignorant of the fact," replied Morel, " or has some&#xD;
good reason for desiring to conceal it."&#xD;
"You are crazy," insisted the Count, "it is impossible."&#xD;
"Your excellency," quoth the domestic, Simon, appearing at the&#xD;
door, 'Colonel Henri Roger desires the honor of an interview  with&#xD;
the Count d'Arezzo."&#xD;
"He is in Florence, is he ?" sarcastically observed Morel.&#xD;
" Well, Morel," quoth the Count blandly, "I am delighted to meet&#xD;
him face to face, for no business is transacted better than in person.&#xD;
Take a seat, Morel, I will receive him in your presence and in such a&#xD;
wise that his marriage will be broken off this very day."&#xD;
" That's your game," responded the visitor, seating himself.&#xD;
" I am in the humor," observed the nobleman as he issued the or-&#xD;
der to Simon to introduce the young Colonel.&#xD;
A moment afterwards a gallant young soldier, the very beau&#xD;
ideal of one of those chivalric heroes, who had, raised themselves to&#xD;
honor and renown in the army of the great Napoleon, entered the&#xD;
apartment with a manly, yet respectful mien.&#xD;
"Wil1 the Count do me the honor of receiving my salutations ?"&#xD;
respectfully said the soldier, after the fashion of the Empire.&#xD;
" What, sir, is the object of your visit?" harshly inquired t'ho&#xD;
Italian.~&#xD;
" You    not ignorant," resumed the Colonel, " that I aspire to the&#xD;
hand, in marriage, of your step-daughter. I have taken the liberty&#xD;
of addressing you several letters from Italy, which, to my regret,&#xD;
have remained unanswered."&#xD;
" Which should have instructed you, sir," replied the Count haughti&#xD;
ly, " that I could not accede to your request,"&#xD;
"I feared so, sir," modestly responded the soldier ; "but as my&#xD;
future happiness depends upon this marriage, I have determined to&#xD;
solicit your approbation."&#xD;
"I conceive it to be, sir, exceedingly strange," answered the Veni&#xD;
,.an, gruffly, " that you have ventured hither, when everything assured&#xD;
you, in advance, of a refusal, which I now declare to be irrevocable.&#xD;
"That's clear, and to the point," murmured Morel.&#xD;
" And now, Count, I come," resumed the Colonel, discarding all&#xD;
tone of inferiority or supplication, "as the bearer of a message, which&#xD;
rmay probably influence you to alter your previous determination."&#xD;
"A message !" quoth the Count, arising from his seat.&#xD;
" But before employing a means repugnant to my honor," continued&#xD;
&#xD;
I",&#xD;
&#xD;
the young soldier in a milder tone of voice, "allow me, sir, to ex-&#xD;
plain to you my situation-"&#xD;
" You stated that you were the bearer of a message," harshly inter-&#xD;
rupted the Venitian noble, "now, what is it? give it me."&#xD;
"No, Count," remonstrated the Colonel, " I do not desire to employ&#xD;
any influence--"&#xD;
aI am waiting for the message," insultingly rejoined the Count.&#xD;
" For mercy's sake," remonstrated the soldier, "just listen to me)/&#xD;
" The message, sir," imperiously demanded the Count, "or I retire."&#xD;
"Since you have forced me to deliver it, here it is," responded the&#xD;
Colonel, presenting to him an epistle.&#xD;
"I am curious to know," remarked the nobleman haughtily, "who&#xD;
dares boast power to overawe my inclinations."&#xD;
" And so am I," murmured the other visitor.&#xD;
The Count leisurely tore open the letter, and dead with an air of&#xD;
indifference, as follows:&#xD;
" Monsieur the Count: the Countess d'Arezzo has promised the&#xD;
hand of her daughter in marriage to.Colonel Roger. This young&#xD;
soldier is the son of one of my companions'in arms; I approve of the&#xD;
marriage, and will be most happy to sign the contract.&#xD;
NAPOLEON.&#xD;
"The Emperor !" ejaculated the enraged Italian, crushing the letter&#xD;
within his palsied hands.&#xD;
"The game's blocked !" muttered Morel significantly.&#xD;
"The desires of the Emperor," quoth the Count in evident confu-&#xD;
sion, " are orders in my case-still, it is--a determination imposed on&#xD;
mae, a forced consent-I must avow to you, sir, that thus taken by sur-&#xD;
prise, I have need of some days-to prepare myself-"&#xD;
" We will wait, sir," responded Colonel Roger, " and during the&#xD;
interval you will learn to appreciate me; shortly, perchance, I will&#xD;
owe to your free action a favor; for which I am at present indebted&#xD;
but to the intervention of the Emperor. Then we will forget this&#xD;
message, of which, sir, I never should have availed myself, had not&#xD;
your cool reception rendered such a step necessary. I will retire, sir,&#xD;
without visiting the Countess, and without divulging the secret of this&#xD;
Interview. I depart, sir, contented, for I believe that which had' its&#xD;
origin in constraint will terminate in friendship."&#xD;
The young man, as he spoke, extended his hand to the Count.&#xD;
" I doubt it," stubbornly said the Venitian, refusing to accept Ite&#xD;
courteous offer, " farewell, sir."&#xD;
" No, Count, not farewell--we will meet again shortly, then autr.&#xD;
voir."&#xD;
The soldier then respectfully took his leave.&#xD;
"Well, Morel ?" ejaculated the Count, disconsolately.&#xD;
"Well," responded that gentleman, arising from his seat, "let your&#xD;
Countship get out of that if you can. .As for me, I have the honor of&#xD;
wishing you good-bye."&#xD;
"Where are you 'going ?" hastily inquired d'Arezzo, as he noticed&#xD;

"To hasten the presentation of my note for five hundred and&#xD;
twelve thousand francs," coolly replied Morel.&#xD;
" Stop !" retorted the Count, " are you not aware that in ruining&#xD;
me, you cause your own ruin likewise ?"&#xD;
" Please, sir, how is that I" ironically inquired the creditor, about&#xD;
to open the door.&#xD;
"Because," growled, as it were, the Italian, "I have arranged in&#xD;
case the matter should turn out thus."&#xD;
"In what way I" resumed Morel, retracting his steps.&#xD;
" You are in debt to me for a fortune," responded the Count d'Ar-&#xD;
ezo, in a low, threatening tone of voice, " which you have acquired&#xD;
within a year through my protection. You would never have made&#xD;
gzch enorrpous profits had it not been that I, with whom important&#xD;
sums have been deposited, have assisted you in illegal transactions,&#xD;
which I dared not undertake myself. Thus I have taken care to secure&#xD;
your responsibility, that my ruin will lead you straight way to the&#xD;
tribunals of justice."&#xD;
"Lt has then been a set trap !" exclaimed Morel.&#xD;
" No, sir," replied the Count, " but an act of foresight."&#xD;
" Yu are an infernal scoundrel !" said the infuriated visitor.&#xD;
" Bless me !" calmly ejaculated the Italian, " and you are another,&#xD;
as I will prove in good time. But as we have no time to waste upou&#xD;
compliments, let us cogitate how to get out of this embarrassment."&#xD;
"Your diff ilty in no wise concerns me," responded, the infuriated&#xD;
Morelf "you subscribed an obligation, relating in no wise to our ar-&#xD;
rangements. It is strictly according to law." And the visitor attempt-&#xD;
ed to leave the room.&#xD;
" I subscribed to the order of Morel," replied the Count, impending&#xD;
lis passage, " and your name is not Morel---j-"&#xD;
"Not Morel !" replied the creditor.&#xD;
' No !" continued the Venitian, " you assumed that name, after es-&#xD;
caping from Florence where you were to be tried as a connterfeiterif&#xD;

" What! you are then awe-" interposed the visitor.&#xD;
" That upon the same day you would annihilate my credit," resurn,&#xD;
ed the Venetian - "I will give you over to the Florentine envoy, who&#xD;
will take you off my hands."&#xD;
"Should that occur," responded More], altering his tone materially,&#xD;
"1 will join my destinies so intimately to your own that we will be&#xD;
mutually compromised."&#xD;
" Now," continued d'Arezzo, calmly, " we understand each other&#xD;
most clearly."&#xD;
"You are right," responded Morel, "what shall we attempt" -&#xD;
" Anything tending to salvation," rejoined the Count.&#xD;
"Tell me, Morel ! when I saw Jane, dying, given up by her phy-&#xD;
gicians '&#xD;
" After her death," interrupted the creditor, "you will have to ao-&#xD;

" The Devil !" muttered the Florentine, " you have all the ,cards."&#xD;
" And now to sweep the board," continued the Count, " but the&#xD;
time has not yet come ; besides I have some combinations to work&#xD;
out. If you could attach yourself to the track of the Colonel-pro-&#xD;
yoke a quarrel-a duel----"&#xD;
"No, thank you," replied Mbrel, dubiously, " he would kill me,&#xD;

" I leave the Colonel to your ingenuity," interrupted the Court;&#xD;
t' to-morrow, I will hold my step-daughter in my power."&#xD;
" To-morrow!" quoth Morel, " she will be far from here."&#xD;
" Far from here ?" inquired the Count.&#xD;
" Her mother sends her hence to-night," replied the visitor, " the&#xD;
matter is all arranged."&#xD;
" Who told you this ?" marvelled the Venetian.&#xD;
" I know not," answered his companion, " but I can convince you&#xD;
of the truth of my assertion."&#xD;
" In what way ?" anxiously inquired the Count.&#xD;
" In the first place," replied Morel, "do you know of a man named&#xD;
Ambroise, who resides at Chaillott ?"&#xD;
" Yes," responded the Italian, " an old servant of the Countess,&#xD;
whom I turned away for considering he had the right to interfere in&#xD;
her disputes-"&#xD;
" The Countess has preserved relations with him," continued Morel,&#xD;
" for immediately after leaving you, she addressed a letter to hime."&#xD;
" And what does that prove ?" interrupted the Count.&#xD;
"IRead the letter," replied Morel, handing him a note, "arid yon&#xD;
will learn all."&#xD;
"How came it into your hands 7" suspiciously said the Count.&#xD;
"Siinply,," responded the Florentine, "because one of your ser&#xD;
vants was entrusted to put it in the post by the Countess, who sod&#xD;
it to me, while I was in the ante-chamber."&#xD;
" Which one of my servants V inquired the Count, foaming with&#xD;
rage.&#xD;
" What difference does that make ?" quietly resumed the Florentine,&#xD;
" read first, and get angry afterwards."&#xD;
" Excuse me, Monsieur Morel," said Simon, who entered the apart-&#xD;
ment, bearing some lighted candles.&#xD;
" What's wanted ?" warmly demanded the Count.&#xD;
" The hackman, whom Monsieur Morel has left at the door of the&#xD;
house," said S iron, apologetically, "wishes to know if there is any&#xD;
further need for him."&#xD;
" Let him wait," replied Morel, " I will leave shortly."&#xD;
" No," interrupted the Count, "let him go."  Then whispering tb&#xD;
Morel, he continued : " I have need of you to-night-the hours are&#xD;
most precious."&#xD;
"But they are waiting for me at home," returned Morel.&#xD;
"Give them notice," said the Count, resuming his writing,&#xD;

JEAN, THE HACKMAN.&#xD;
THE door opened, and, and in entered the coachman, a fine-looking&#xD;
man of middle age, whose figure, although costumed in the dress pecu-&#xD;
lian to his professional calling, evinced a manly independence and&#xD;
martial bearing, at once announcing him to have been a veteran of&#xD;
of the Empire.&#xD;
" Excuse the liberty, sir," quoth the hackman, known 'among his&#xD;
associates as Jean the Mountaineer, holding his hat in his hand r-&#xD;
spectfully, " but I have the habit of giving notice-we are too often&#xD;
forgotten-and there is discontent for time goes on according to law."&#xD;
"You can go," replied Morel.&#xD;
" Then I did right in notifying you that the coach was below," re-&#xD;
sponded the hackman ; then looking at his watch, he continued: "You&#xD;
engaged me at half-past four ; it is now half-past nine; ive hours&#xD;
exactly."&#xD;
" And I' owe you ?" interposed Morel.&#xD;
"Forty sous the first hour," replied Jean, "and thirty sous each&#xD;
hour after *"it is easy to reckon : eight francs exact."&#xD;
" Iere1 -e ten !" answered More; giving him the coin.&#xD;
"And here are two in exchange," responded the coachman, taking&#xD;
out his purse.&#xD;
"I t is unnecessary," interposed the Florentine.&#xD;
 Thad you, sir !" said Jean retiring towards the door.&#xD;
"Hold !" quoth Morel, " you are carrying money you have not&#xD;
fully earned."&#xD;
" Pardon, sir, but I thought-" apologized the hackman.&#xD;
"You will go to the Place des Vosgeo, number seven, and inform&#xD;
tiem that the master of the house will not be home to-night," quoth&#xD;
Morel, laying stress on the direction.&#xD;
"Yes, sir," murmured Jean. " Place des Vosgeo-still another&#xD;
course    "&#xD;
" What are you saying ?" inquired Morel, bluntly.&#xD;
"I was saying that it was another course," responded the Backman&#xD;
frankly. " It may not be for other cabmen, who put up at Piepus&#xD;
or Sainte Antonine-but I live at the Barrierdes Bonnes HIommes, and&#xD;
in going from the rue de Verneuil to Passy, the- Place des Vosgeo is&#xD;
not exactly the shortest cut."&#xD;
" That's well enough," interrupted the Count impatiently ; "di,-&#xD;
pense with your reflections-you are paid-go !"&#xD;

&#xD;
" The gentleman is too polite, for one not to hurry on his errand,"&#xD;
returned the hackman, placing his hat upon his head.&#xD;
" What's your number !" inquired Morel.&#xD;
" Two hundred and twenty-six, sir," replied Jean.&#xD;
Well,-' responded the Florentine, " if I find, to-morrow, that you&#xD;
have not done my errand, I'll have you put in the workhouse-now,&#xD;
go !"&#xD;
" No danger," replied the Hackman, " I owe you a course, even if I&#xD;
make it on foot."&#xD;
Ihen as the mountaineer departed from the room, he was almost&#xD;
tempted to return the money and request his employer to secure the&#xD;
services of some other of his companions. A fear, alone, of the coni-&#xD;
missary of police, prevented this ebullition of spleen on his part, so&#xD;
he emerged the apartment with a determination to make the most&#xD;
of a bad bargain.&#xD;
" Well!" said Morel, arising and going to the Count.&#xD;
" You have read this letter ?" inquired the Italian.&#xD;
" I merely cast my eyes at its contents;" replied Morel.&#xD;
The nobleman handed him the note, which read:&#xD;
"Ambroise : The Count d'Arezzo wishes to employ the last hours&#xD;
of his authority over Jane to torture her-and I can do no better&#xD;
than concealing hei- with you. At ten o'clock precisely Jane will&#xD;
leave the mansion, going down the rue de Verneuil to that of du Baca&#xD;
Hasten ; be at the corner of these streets, where you will meet her&#xD;
Conduct her first to your house at Chaillot-on the morrow depart&#xD;
for Fontainbleau, where you must remain for ten days. Do riot&#xD;
write ; the letters may indicate your retreat; in everything else Jane&#xD;
will counsel you."&#xD;
" It now wants but a few minutes of ten," quoth Morel drawing&#xD;
out his watch and making a calculation.&#xD;
I have no time to prevent this departure," resumed the Count,&#xD;
walking in agitation. " No ! I should not desire to do so, now I aui&#xD;
instructed of it  More! can I not join Jane, and see her without&#xD;
dread of her mother's intervention ?"&#xD;
" You can, I suppose," tranquilly responded Morel.&#xD;
"Instead of tearing her from me," continued d'Arezzo, " the Coun-&#xD;
tes has thrown her in my arms, and I shall be annoyed should she&#xD;
change her plan-let us see what passes."&#xD;
The Count went to the window, and withdrew the curtain, whi'l&#xD;
Morel concealed the burning candles behind somne.pieces of furniture,&#xD;
t.bat their forms might not be seen before them.&#xD;
" No one in the Countess' apartments," whispered the Count as ha&#xD;
gazed out through the window ; "yes, some one opens the vestibule,&#xD;
the door opens; the Countess embraces her daughter; Jane leaves her;&#xD;
the door has closed-Jane has gone !"&#xD;
" Perhaps, not meeting Ambroise, she will return to the mansion,"&#xD;
suggested Morel.&#xD;
"No !" replied the Count in agitation ; " she will continue on to&#xD;
Chaillot, expecting to meet him-it is ten o'cloc :?"&#xD;

"Yes, Connt," returned Morel.&#xD;
"Morel," resumed the Count, earnestly, " should we not prevent&#xD;
this marriage, think you I will be imprisoned after the fifteen days&#xD;
of notification ?"&#xD;
I am certain of it," responded his companion.&#xD;
* And the slightest confusion in my case will seriously compromise&#xD;
you with me," quoth the Italian.&#xD;
"'That is what I dread," moodily answered Morel.&#xD;
"Morel," said the -Count in a tone of decision, " we must follow&#xD;
upon the trace of' Jane-we have not a minute to spare."&#xD;
The Count d' Arrezzo summoned Simon to him and gave directions&#xD;
to bring fresh candles, alleging as a reason that Morel apd he had a&#xD;
long series of accounts to arrange, which would require their atten-&#xD;
tion all night. Particularly cautioning them not to suffer them to be&#xD;
disturbed in their nocturnal work, the Count dismissed his domestic&#xD;
a7d cautiously bolted the door after him: an operation Morel viewed&#xD;
with astonishment.&#xD;
"some, Morel," continued the Count after finishing all his precao-&#xD;
tions, " let us hasten after her."&#xD;
" You told your people," interposed the Florentine, " that you&#xD;
were to remain hese locked up all night, and now they will see you&#xD;
go out."&#xD;
No !" replied the Italian opening a secret door in the 'Wall, " this&#xD;
conducts us to the garden, whence we can pass into the street unseen."&#xD;
" Very well," said Morel, taking his hat, while the Count produced&#xD;
a couple of masks, from a drawer in one of the pieces of furniture.&#xD;
" Take this mask," the Count continued, " and I will use this one."&#xD;
"   mask !" remonstrated Morel, " why a mask !"&#xD;
For prudence sake," responded the Italian.&#xD;
"What are you going to do ?" inquired Morel hesitating.&#xD;
" I have not made up may mind," said the Count ; " we will think&#xD;
of it as we go along."&#xD;
Still," remonstrated Morel.&#xD;
"Will you leave all traces of Jane ?" inquired the Count.&#xD;
" No," replied his companion.&#xD;
" Then let us staet," nervously said the Venitian.&#xD;
I am ready," sullenly responded Morel.&#xD;
As an act of further precaution the Count took off his rings, which&#xD;
he usually wore, and cast them upon the table. In a moment after&#xD;
the two passed through the secret door and disappeared as it closed&#xD;
solemnly upon its hinges.&#xD;

Ti main feature of the habitation of Jean, the owner and driver&#xD;
of carriage No. 220, situated at the Barrier des Bonnes 1-lommes,&#xD;
upon the top of one of those steep hills whence the citizens of Passy&#xD;
are accustomed to gaze down upon the Parisian metropolis, was a&#xD;
lhce cellar the ordinary receptacle of the appliances belonging t his&#xD;
dail~ing. In this emporium  things necessary, Jean found him hard&#xD;
at cogitation upon some occurrences which had marked his eventful&#xD;
career, In the open court yard stood his bright green hack, while in&#xD;
the reriote corner of the subterranean apartment tranquilly dozed&#xD;
one of his companions, an occasional member of Jean's household,&#xD;
which was managed and controlled by the Dame Champagre, an aged&#xD;
and half, deaf woman, a kind neighbor he maintained from charitable&#xD;
motives, for Jean leaving the mountains, still maintained an inkling&#xD;
of their generous hospitality.&#xD;
"Hulo, you there, Dame Champagre," quoth Jean, perceiving the&#xD;
old lady upon the stair way leading to the inhabited quarters of&#xD;
Jean's mansion, " wait a moment. I have something to give you for&#xD;
the young lady."&#xD;
Jean went out into the court.yard and the Dame, whom he had&#xD;
forgotten to be afflicted with deafness, disappeared up the stair-way-&#xD;
and left her host in possession of the deserted premises, holding in his&#xD;
hand a little package which he had taken from the hack with a deal of&#xD;
preaution.&#xD;
"Well," soliloquised Jean, depositing the package upon a piece of&#xD;
furniture, "It will do at some other time. The old lady's deaf, and&#xD;
I shouldn't speak loud for fear of waking Pierre, who has worked&#xD;
hard at his shop during the fete of St. Cloud, tnd the fellow want&#xD;
.leep. He'll stay here until Sunday, then he will go and amuse hin-&#xD;
self, according to his habit, at the criminal courts. Well, every man&#xD;
to his taste."&#xD;
The hoar of opening the public fountain having arrived, the back-&#xD;
man took his buckets and startedto water his horse, and thus save&#xD;
himself a superfluous journey to the Seine.&#xD;
Jean had not expended many moments upon this branch of his&#xD;
labors ere the occupant of the straw gave signs of animation and&#xD;
finally leaped to the ground with a somerset of decided agility.&#xD;
" Only a fly," muttered the sleeper, wh6 was no less a personage&#xD;

the carriage of Jean in the court-yard, "Jean has come back ! yes.&#xD;
there's the green hack and I hear the Negress and Marego munehin.&#xD;
their oats iin the stable like happy beasts as they are; but where is&#xD;
Jean ? I will seek him in his chamber."&#xD;
Petit Pierre was about to ascend the stair-case when he remem-&#xD;
bered that Dame Chanpagre had inforImd him that it was in the&#xD;
occupation of an unknown lady.     So the Savoyard halted and&#xD;
prosecuted his researches elsewhere.&#xD;
Ilo, my little Pierre," shouted Jean, appearing at the entrance&#xD;
of the cellar with his buckets in his hands, " what, up and kicking as&#xD;
weil as ever'"&#xD;
" Yes, Jean," replied the peasant," light a candle."-&#xD;
 What woke you there ?" inquired the Hackman.&#xD;
A fly," responded Petit Pierre, scratching his nose.&#xD;
loid !" quoth Jean, looking into the stables, "old Marengo has&#xD;
gi elt the fresh water; coming, old boy, coming."&#xD;
-That's right !" responded Pierre, " give Marengo fresh water, he&#xD;
wi l never drink it younger ; as for me I'll take a bite.&#xD;
Pierre went to the cupboard, took out a loaf of bread and cut off a&#xD;
slice.&#xD;
"Everybody served ! nobody wants anything !" gaily said the&#xD;
the hack man, as lie entered his depository. "Pierre, I have not seen&#xD;
you since your return."&#xD;
" At six o'clock this morning," replied Pierre, beating upon his&#xD;
lhand, "you had gone-when I had got back."&#xD;
" I was on the stand," rejoined Jean, as he commenced blacking the&#xD;
traces hanging against the wall, " at five in the morning ; that gives&#xD;
trie time to rest the horses in the middle of the day. \But tell me,&#xD;
are you content with your little journey ?"&#xD;
The end was good," replied the Savoyard. " I sold my portraits ;&#xD;
see. there only remain a Monsieur and Madame Denis, and one Na-'&#xD;
pdleo n and two old rabbits."  As lie spoke he opened the euphord arid&#xD;
drew forth some plaster images'which he placed upon a board to re-&#xD;
arrnish, then he continued; " I must fix up my store-still the two&#xD;
ir4 day's from a continual rain."&#xD;
Oh, yes," interrupted Jeancontinuing at his labor, "I thought of&#xD;
-voi and said to mrynself, if we only knew it would turn out so, Petit&#xD;
I'ierre would not have started for two days."&#xD;
You may believe it," resumed Pierre, intent upon the work of&#xD;
roLtoring his images from  damage, " for then iy figure -would not&#xD;
have been vet, and I could have been present at the sentence of the&#xD;
pretty bar woman, tried for having two husbands&#xD;
She has been condemned," responded Jean, toiling at the traces,&#xD;
that pretty bar wonan, to ten year's imprisonment."&#xD;
" Ten years !" exclaimed Pierre. " How I should like to have been&#xD;
there, I, who had listened to all the interrogations&#xD;
You were there theta I"&#xD;
No ! replied Jean," I heard it yesterday, at the Prefecture."&#xD;
\V hat were yu doiig at the lPretoet ire'?" said the Savoyard.&#xD;
&#xD;
" To deposit there a pocket book," responded the hackman, " which&#xD;
a young nt forgot in my cab. I could not find out where his home&#xD;
was, for 1 set him down at the gate of Luxembourg, so I took it to&#xD;
the place-for reclamations, where i heard about the pretty woman and&#xD;
her two husbands."&#xD;
" Do you think it right ?" inquired Pierre.&#xD;
Yes, it is right," responded Jean, " but there are many who&#xD;
have two husbands-still it is the law-that's all we can say !"&#xD;
"That's all we can say," reiterated the peasant, " and you, my poor&#xD;
J enn, you have beeni thrown into the water ?"&#xD;
fHow do you know ?' srmilingly inquired the hackman.&#xD;
"'This morning, also, when I came," rejoined  Pierre, " I was&#xD;
going up to your roon, when t net that venerable youth-the Dame&#xD;
hliainpagne, who told ine something-but the young girl said you&#xD;
saved toy lite-that she owes it to von-"&#xD;
No, to Marengo," responded Jean.&#xD;
"Marengo!" ejaculated Pierre, mysteriously.&#xD;
I was returning Thursday evening from the place des Vosges,"&#xD;
'luoth Jean, leaving his work to narrate the adventure, "I wanted to&#xD;
take Champs Elyses, but Marengo turned to the left to take the river's&#xD;
edge-that was not my idea but his-and as I was not engaged, f&#xD;
u old not disappoint the poor beast and we took the side of the&#xD;
river. When we arrived by the heighth of the Bridge of Jena, I&#xD;
heard something fall into the water. As the waters are low, I drove&#xD;
lose to the edge of the pier and then I could plainly see a woman,&#xD;
struggling in the river. I soon sprang over a pile of wood' and&#xD;
thence drew forth the poor creature-not a single passer-by to aid&#xD;
Inc."&#xD;
Not a single one," replied Pierre, deeply interested.&#xD;
"None," resumed Jean, " for it was going on midnight-but old&#xD;
Marengo-you know he follows me like a dog-well, he dragged the&#xD;
Negress after him and there they stood about fifty steps to come up&#xD;
to tile. I put the poor creature in the hack, for the hospital wag fir&#xD;
off and my house was near. I was soon here, I woke up our neigh-&#xD;
bor, Dame Champagne, and the doctor, and what a night we passed.&#xD;
The next day she was no woman, but mad-devoured by the levei-&#xD;
and I would not leave her a moment with Dame Champagne, fearing&#xD;
each convulsion would be the last. . However, during the night, she&#xD;
became cam; and yesterday the doctor told us that the crisis woi'ld&#xD;
not return again, and that she was saved. Then, you c6uld not iia-&#xD;
giiie nily lhappiess, to have gazed upon that beautiful young girl-o&#xD;
near perishitig-and to know her out of danger. At that moment&#xD;
above all I thought of you, and l said to myself: ' Here is a piece of&#xD;
joy, and Petit Pierre is not here to take his share in it.'"&#xD;
Oh, yes," interrupted Pierre, "I would rather not have gone to St.&#xD;
Cloud, and this young woman, would she drown herself?"&#xD;
"' That is not certain," resumed Jean, sagely, " but there is no ques-&#xD;

one nathed Ambroise. I dared not refuse and there we learned that&#xD;
Ambroise had started two days before, to his sisters at Melun. I&#xD;
feared this little promenade would fatigue her, but no, I saw upon my&#xD;
return and she is well and has related tier history."&#xD;
" How then did it all happen 1" inquired Petit Pierreh&#xD;
" We   greed," resumed Jean, "tlat is, Dame Champagne and I,  he&#xD;
bd wished to destroy herself, not from misery, for she had silk gown&#xD;
and embroidered petticoats-it would not be anything but love--&#xD;
" It could be nothing else," interrupted Pierre, eagerly.-&#xD;
"Well, it was something else," replied Jean: he continued his nar-&#xD;
rative : " As she was going late in the evening to Ambroise'q at Cha-&#xD;
Iot-.she had passed the es lanade, when suddenly two brigands--rob&#xD;
bern in masks, Precipitated themselves upon her ; the  oor girl was&#xD;
seized before she could cry aloud ; they tore from her er necklace,&#xD;
watch and chain, and threw her into the river."&#xD;
"Good heavens !" ejaculated the kind hearted Savoyard.&#xD;
Yes, Pierre," responded Jean, "such scoundrels are to be fiund."&#xD;
"1I am aware of it," replied Pierre, " I see them at the Court of&#xD;
ises,-     d you have learned all this to day  le you were asleep."&#xD;
"Butn a  little while ago," responded Jean, "1whileyoweeaepi&#xD;
"Then P11 run to the commissary." ejaculated hierre, excitedly,&#xD;
"id lodge a ('rnplaint-"&#xD;
"No at all !"rmntrated the hackmnan, "not at all."&#xD;
"But, yes," insisted Pierre, "1you know nothing about such affairs.&#xD;
It is  criminal matter-we commenced by a complaint-the police&#xD;
will hail the assassins and it will finish by a sentence. By all that's&#xD;
good ! it will be a brilliant affair and every one will have to get up&#xD;
early to secure a good seat-1 shall be on the other side of the bar as&#xD;
a witness I will see all without a farthing---I shall run to the commis-&#xD;
sary.".                                .&#xD;
"Await first," said Jean, stopping his exit.&#xD;
" But," interposed Pierre.&#xD;
" Think you, I had no inclination," resumed Jean, " to run to the&#xD;
pcyice ats soon as I learned all this."&#xD;
"Well," observed Pierre seriously, " what prevented youo&#xD;
*" The young girl," resumed the'hackman, " who begged of me to&#xD;
await until she returned to her family, and she is too ill yet to expose&#xD;
her to new emotions. It is necessary to punish these brigands,yes;&#xD;
and they cannot escape, but above all it is not right to injure the inno&#xD;
cent to be avenged upon them. Let us await until the young girl is&#xD;
recovered--you know not what she is called, Pierre ?-now what&#xD;
think you is her name?&#xD;
"What is it?" said the perplexed Savoyard.&#xD;
"Jane " replied Jean the hackman.&#xD;
"Jane 4" hesitatingly mused Pierre.&#xD;
"The same as the little one," murmured Jean, " of the cottage"&#xD;
"Yes the same as the little one," repeated the peasant. "&#xD;
" What has become ot her ?" quoth Jean, in a pensive humor, "of&#xD;
my daughter and Genevieve. The blessing of Heaven should have&#xD;
acornpanied them in their riches."&#xD;
&#xD;

"Poor Jean Claude !" meditated Pierre, silently, "he often thinks&#xD;
of his wifeand child"&#xD;
"Eighteen years soon passes !" continued Jean in his reflections.&#xD;
" Jean !" exclaimed Pierre, advancing to the hackman and awaken-&#xD;
ing him from his day-dream," come, let's see Mademoiselle."&#xD;
"Yes," replied Jean, " distraction will do her good ; you go first&#xD;
and I wvil charge you with a little message."&#xD;
"well, what is it ?" exclaimed the delighted Pierre.&#xD;
"Yesterday," responded Jean, "when I took her to Chaillot, it&#xD;
was necessary to be all dressed-her silk gown, her petticoats-and&#xD;
we dried them well, before they were put on-but at the moment of&#xD;
starting I saw she looked for something to put on her head. She is&#xD;
the daughter of rich folks, you see, and not accustomed to go out into&#xD;
the streets bare-headed. I said nothing, for she is so young, so hand-&#xD;
some,-we could not offer her a hat of Dame Charnpag   , eso hnd&#xD;
"By no manner of means !" interrupted the Savoyard.&#xD;
"This morning in passing by the market of St. Jacques," confiden-&#xD;
tially continued the hackman, "I saw a pretty little bonnet with rose-&#xD;
colored bands, ad Ibought it. And as I don't know how to offer&#xD;
it to her, you will give it to her on my behalf."&#xD;
Ths speaking, Jean took the package, which he had originally in-&#xD;
tended to send by Dame Champagne, and handed it to Pierre.&#xD;
"It's agreed !" replied the honest Savoyard.&#xD;
"I've just time to blacken Marengo's collar," responded Jean, "and&#xD;
I will com and join you."&#xD;
"vA little time hence," murmured Pierre as he ascended the stair-&#xD;
way, "and I will make her a little present. I bought at Cloud's a&#xD;
shawl with flowers, which I intend to give to the flower-girl who takes&#xD;
charge of my shop when I go into the palace of justice-I will buy&#xD;
her another; it cost me three francs fifteen sos, but I'll give her&#xD;
your bonnet first."&#xD;
" Above all," cautioned Jean, " don't speak of the commissary."&#xD;
" " replied Pierre. "but don't-you want to make a complaint ?"&#xD;
"No," sharply answered the hackman, "I don't wish i&#xD;
" Nor I either," responded Pierre, " here's to your errand."&#xD;
CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
THE SOLDIER's soN.&#xD;
JEAN, the coachman,, was well satisfied with the return of his com-&#xD;
panion, for he would feel the departure of the young girl less bitterly.&#xD;
As he had been seated by her side the previous evening, while she&#xD;
was arranging her toilet, the poor man thought he saw Genevieve.&#xD;
The dream of twenty years hung over him.&#xD;
" Thisis the place," quoth a young gentleman, entering the court-&#xD;
yard; "yes, the number 226-the very man himself."&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7438-00000026"/>&#xD;
"What's wanting ?" inquired the hackman respectful ly.&#xD;
"Yes, now I recognize you," continued the young nan.&#xD;
" I don't recognize you," responded Jean, perplexed&#xD;
" I forgot a pocket-book in your carriage," resumed the gentlemnthe -&#xD;
" Ah, it is you !" quoth Jean, " I no longer have it - it is at the&#xD;
Prefecture to be reclaimed."&#xD;
" It was returned to me this morning," replied the young man.&#xD;
"I am glad," responded Jean, " it has reached its owner." bank-&#xD;
"Sir" resumed the gentleman, " the pocket-book, besides&#xD;
bills, contained papers of vital importance to me ; and grateful at the&#xD;
act of probity which has restored them to me, I have hurried to your&#xD;
house to beg you to accept a just reward."&#xD;
"No, sir, no," interrupted Jean earnestly, "I consider it theft to&#xD;
take possession of anything belonging to another, andno nioan deserves&#xD;
a reward for not having stolen."&#xD;
"Monsieur Jean," spoke the young man in a tone of pride, "you&#xD;
are an honest man."&#xD;
"I believe so, sir," replied the hackman.&#xD;
"1I have a proposition," continued the gentleman after a moment's&#xD;
reflection, " to make to you."&#xD;
"tWhat is it, sir ?' modestly inquired the coachman.&#xD;
"sMy fortune permits me to keep horses," i ejoimed the young man,&#xD;
" and if you would take charge of my stables, as an honest man can&#xD;
never be over-paid, I would leave you to arrange your own terms."&#xD;
"I am thankful to you, sir," proudly answered Jean, drawing hnim&#xD;
self to his full height, "it would be necessary to wear livery, and&#xD;
when a man has been a soldier--"&#xD;
"You have served then ?" inquired the stranger.     .    I&#xD;
" For fourteen years," responded Jean; with a military air. "n&#xD;
the 6th dragoons, styled the War-Dogs, in which regiment for ten&#xD;
years I have been lance-sergeant."&#xD;
" I crave your pardon, sir," replied the young man, " the livery can&#xD;
never replace the uniform. I know it, for I am a soldier, and the son&#xD;
of a soldier."&#xD;
" You a soldier !" warmly exclaimed Jean, "I served from '95 to&#xD;
1809."&#xD;
"You made the campaigns of Italy ?" quoth the stranger.&#xD;
"The first and the second, and that of Egypt between them," re-&#xD;
joined the hackman, with a glow of enthusiasm. e,,&#xD;
"1How then have you remained so long a sub-officer I earnestly in.&#xD;
quired the gentleman, interested in the veteran's story.&#xD;
"tAh !" responded the veteran with a sigh, "I know neither how to&#xD;
read or write. Since I quitted the service Ihave learned a little of&#xD;
both-to be a coach-driver it was necessary to read the names of the&#xD;
streets and the numbers of the houses. Had I known as much before,&#xD;
I never should have been' uneasy as to the  ure&#xD;
"I have, Monsieur Jean," joyfully resumed the stranger, "a retreat&#xD;
I can offer you."&#xD;
"Truly, sir," interrupted Jean, gratefully.&#xD;

i'In the forest guardians," returned the gentleman, " who wear as&#xD;
we may say, the veteran's uniform. Thanks to- my position in the&#xD;
Italian army of occupation, I can place at your disposal the situation&#xD;
of frontier guardian ni the forest of Piedmont."&#xD;
"That is something like," responded the veteran, " sir, I would like&#xD;
to end my days somewhere in Piedmont, where I could view the lofty&#xD;
peaks of the Alps ; still I would be unwilling to give up my business&#xD;
as long as I have Marengo."&#xD;
" And who is Marengo ?" inquired the young soldier.&#xD;
" My old horse," replied Jean, " another of the 6th dragoons y we&#xD;
were together at Marengo, and a slash intended for me there cut off&#xD;
his left ear ; we were moreover together at Cautzig, both down, and I&#xD;
believed he never rose from the field.,,,",a&#xD;
" Still you have found him again ?" said the gentlemen.&#xD;
"Two years after, at the market," resumed the veteran; "I was&#xD;
buying a hack and horses. I knew enough to husband the proceeds&#xD;
of victory, and in passing the mart where old horses are sold I recog-&#xD;
nized Marengo, from his lost ear. As soon as he heard my voice, he&#xD;
rushed to my side. He was for sale at sixty francs, a horse who had&#xD;
seen Rivoli, Cairo, and Austerlitz. I bought him immediately, and&#xD;
for five years we have toiled together."&#xD;
" Can he do duty still as a hack-horse ?" inquired-the soldier.&#xD;
" I must say," exclaimed Jean, "that I joined with him the Negress,&#xD;
a black mare of great strength, and she gently leads him along when&#xD;
in harness. However, although twenty-five years old, Marengo, still&#xD;
has a heart. Why, sir, the other day, during a sham fight on the&#xD;
Champ de Mars, they fired cannons and sounded the charge. Well!&#xD;
no sooner did Marengo hear a noise of battle than he dressed his ear,&#xD;
since he has but one, looked at me whining, as if to say: 'Oho, Jean!&#xD;
to the saddle ! the Austrians are at hand.' Well, sir, it made me&#xD;
laugh as well as cry, and I could not help saying to himdOho, my&#xD;
boy ! the Austrians are no longer in the field.' Who would believe&#xD;
it ? there are stances when I talk to that old horse as if he were a&#xD;
human being."&#xD;
"Sub-officer Jean !" quoth the young soldier kindly, "the situation&#xD;
of forest guard, which I offer you, will be at your service whenever&#xD;
you wish to take advantage of it."&#xD;
" In that case," thankfully responded the veteran, "I may have&#xD;
time to reconsider my refusal."&#xD;
"You can always find my address at the war office," continued the&#xD;
soldier;-" this is my nane, Colonel Roger."&#xD;
"There was a general by that name," sadly rejoined Jean.&#xD;
ie was my father," responded the young man.&#xD;
" Your hither !" earnestly exclaimed the veeeran, gazing upon the&#xD;
young soldier fixedly.&#xD;
"- W ho was shot upon Mount Cenis by being betrayed." murmured&#xD;
the hackman.&#xD;
"Did you se-ve beneath his orders ?" warmly inquired the gentle-&#xD;

"I, no !" thoughtfully replied Jean. " I Jean, the Mountaineer,&#xD;
commencednmy campaign under Massena.           " whenever you&#xD;
" It's of no consequence," resumed the Colonel;"wevryo&#xD;
desire it, the post of guard is at your service. Now I have another&#xD;
request."~&#xD;
"And pray what is that, Colonel ?" in turn inquired Jean.&#xD;
" Before leaving, I must see Marengo," replied the soldier.&#xD;
"Tht i eay eouh !"ro ended Jean delightedly. " Please to&#xD;
pass through the stable, whence a door leads to the street. But don't&#xD;
expect to see a gallant steed, still you know many a gay lancer ends&#xD;
his career an invalid-this way, Colonel."&#xD;
The hackman with aaproud step marshalled the young soldier into&#xD;
the court-yard, while at the same moment Pierre appeared on the&#xD;
staircase and descended the steps with precaution.g around him,&#xD;
and then addressing the young girl, he continued: "Come down, ma-&#xD;
demoiselle, there .is no one here."&#xD;
"Has Monsieur Jean gone out then ?" inquired the young lady,&#xD;
who, in addition to her costume, wore the little bonnet purchased for&#xD;
her by the kind old veteran.&#xD;
" Oh ! no !" responded Pierre, as he caught sight of the hack, still&#xD;
standing in the court-yard ; " perhaps he is in the stable: shall I call&#xD;
hin, Miss ?"&#xD;
"Donot disarrange him," modestly replied the young maiden.&#xD;
" Here he is !" exclaimed Pierre, as he noticed Jean coming from&#xD;
the stable.&#xD;
"The son of General Roger !" quoth Jean, talking to himself; then&#xD;
observing his guests, he gaily said, "Ah, Pierre ! and Mademoiselle ?"&#xD;
"We have been waiting for you," observed the beautiful girl,&#xD;
gently.&#xD;
"You did not come, so, as I wished to thank you-for the pretty&#xD;
bonnet you had the kindness to buy me, I come to you. How do&#xD;
you do this morning!",~&#xD;
" Good heavens   how beautiful !" exclaimed Jean in raptures-&#xD;
" after all, it is not the bonnet-but since your color has returned&#xD;
"I trust it has," interrupted the girl, taking a seat. " Monsieu&#xD;
Jean, we will have a long account to settle. So many cares ! such&#xD;
kindness, and so much money spent for me, every day !"&#xD;
" Money mademoiselle !" stammered the hackman, ' don~ t speak&#xD;
of that ! we always have it ! that is to say, Pierre and I have a little&#xD;
which always sleeps in our money box-"c                 -i-h&#xD;
"Yes, we have a money box," quoth the Savoyard, coming to his&#xD;
rescue.&#xD;
"rAnd I have something more," modestly said the damsel, in&#xD;
tones of gratitude, "to request from your inexhaustable goodness-&#xD;
" Perhaps a little shawl," thought Petit Pierre to himself; "now&#xD;
is the time to offer mine," and he went off to search for the precious&#xD;
article in the cap box.&#xD;

It is four days," resumed the girl, ," since I have been with you ?"&#xD;
"Yes, mademoiselle," responded Jean, " four days."&#xD;
tI have had but a few hours," continued the young maiden, "when&#xD;
the light of reason dawned upon me, when I have been    'prmited&#xD;
the use of my senses-d   nug        ur I iha     en permitted&#xD;

"Your poor mother," sighed forth the generous Jean, "must be&#xD;
sorely distressed on your account.'&#xD;
"No, happily," gratefully replied the girl, "she does not expect&#xD;
me--she bieves me absent on a journey."&#xD;
"That is indd luky"       '    d&#xD;

holding behind him the bundle containing his intended present, "and&#xD;
your father, Mademoiselle ?"b'&#xD;
"My father !" mournfully added the damsel, "it was to escape&#xD;
" He loves you not !" ejaculated the wonder-stricken Jeau.&#xD;
"mHe !" exclaimed the maiden disdainfully, "he is not my father;&#xD;
my mother has lost her first husband.y&#xD;
" Then he is but your step-father ?'" insinuated the hackman.&#xD;
"Yes," replied the lady sadly, "my good mother who never&#xD;
wished to marry again, sacrificed herself for my welfare to save my&#xD;
fortune, and she has been sadly recompensed. On account of my&#xD;
step-father, I do not fly, this very instant, to the arms of my mother&#xD;
whom I will expect to-morrow, and whom 1 wish to apprize in&#xD;
secret-not of my accident, but of my unexpected arrival. Dare I&#xD;
supplicate you, beg of you to take charge of a letter to her ?"&#xD;
During these remarks, Petit Pierre passed to the opposite side of&#xD;
the lady and gaily unfolded his cherished shawl.&#xD;
"That is an easy task," replied Jean.&#xD;
"You will please to hand to her a note in private, and to her alone,"&#xD;
resumedthe damsel; "for should the letter fall into the hands of my&#xD;
stepfather, evil will come of it."Y&#xD;
"RPest easy on that score," responded Jean ; " it will soon be eve.&#xD;
ning, I will soon go to my stand for the night. Does your mother&#xD;
live in Paris ?"&#xD;
"Rue de Verneuil, No. 8," replied the lady.&#xD;
" No. 8 r" ejaculated Jean, "are you not mistaken in the number ?&#xD;
"No," returned the girl.&#xD;
"No. 8!" rejoined Jean, "that is a magnificent mansion."&#xD;
"'Which belongs to my mother," resumed the young lady.&#xD;
"To your mother !" exclaimed Jean, while Pierre who had unrolled&#xD;
his shawl to surprise her by throwing it over her shoulders, remained&#xD;
petrified, as it were.'&#xD;
" There," continued the maiden, following out her plan of instruct-&#xD;

"You, Mademoiselle !" repeated the hackman, in redoubled aston-&#xD;
ishment.&#xD;
" The daughter of a Countess !" murmured Petit Pierre to himself,&#xD;
"the shawl is too small," and he vigorously rolled it up again.&#xD;
"And I," resumed Jean, "have dared to offer you-oh ! it was not&#xD;
a bonnet, it should have been a hat ! but I did'nt know and-you must&#xD;
pardon me."&#xD;
" That bonnet, Monsieur Jean," warmly responded the young girl,&#xD;
" I would not exchange for a diadem.--It will be treasured as the best&#xD;
souvenir of my life."&#xD;
" In truth ?" interposed Pierre, then he internally resolved to pre&#xD;
sent her with the shawl, which he unfolded again.&#xD;
" Go hide yourself with your three livre shawl," uoth Jean to the&#xD;
Savoyard, and who was approaching the girl, cap in hand.&#xD;
" It won't do then," muttered the disconsolate Pierre as he retired&#xD;
to refold up his unfortunate purchase.&#xD;
"Madam, you have suffered probably from the poverty of your&#xD;
host," apologetically asserted the humane hackman.&#xD;
" All the treasures of the earth," responded the young maiden en&#xD;
thusiastically, " could not have drawn me from the river ; we cannot&#xD;
purchase courage and devotion."&#xD;
"That is true," mused Jean, " for it is not wealth which gives a&#xD;
heart."&#xD;
" Oh, yes, you are right," responded Jane; " and have a care that&#xD;
my letter does not fall in the hands of the Count d'Arezzo."&#xD;
" Have no fear," answered Jean.&#xD;
"I will hasten and write it," joyfully exclaimed the girl.&#xD;
"Yes, Mademoiselle," replied Jean, " Pierre will guide you to the.&#xD;
chamber and bring you everything you want."&#xD;
"Come, Mademoiselle," kindly quoth Pierre, " everything is in the&#xD;
chamber."&#xD;
" And while you are writing," resumed thehackman, "I will ha'l&#xD;
ness up the team ; it will not be long."&#xD;
" This way, Mademoiselle," gallantly quoth Pierre, guiding the&#xD;
young woman along the stairway. Then as he gazed upon the fair&#xD;
creature his thoughts turned upon his intended present, and he for a&#xD;
moment wavered in determination between giving it to the flower girl&#xD;
or converting it into a waistcoat.&#xD;
CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
THE LOST TREASURE IS FOUND!&#xD;
HONEST JEAN, the hackman, reflected seriously upon the narrative&#xD;
of the young girl, and wondered intensely how a step-father could&#xD;
render this treasure of a girl unhappy. She was the daughter of a.&#xD;
Countess, and the worthy man thought to himself that his Jane night&#xD;
&#xD;
TIIE  ALPINE    GUIDE.                  55&#xD;
be one too, for Genevieve was of a noble family. As the bewildered&#xD;
hackrnan sought for his reins which he unhooked from the wall and&#xD;
hung around his neck, he meditated that his daughter would soon be&#xD;
twenty-one years of age, and was now perchance married to some gay&#xD;
nobleman. Jean soothed his conscience by the reminiscence that upon&#xD;
each succeeding anniversary of her birth, he had caused mass to be&#xD;
said to ensure the blessings of Providence upon her.&#xD;
" After all," soliloquized the perplexed Jean, "the young creature&#xD;
calculates upon me and I must make hate-where are my reins? I&#xD;
had them a moment ago-ah ! here they are-l scarcely know what I&#xD;
am about ; my head is wool-gathering."at&#xD;
" Jean !" exclaimed Pierre, coming down the stairway out of breath&#xD;
and violently agitated, "there is no need of harnessing up the horses;&#xD;
I'll carry the letter to the Countess. You must not go there with it."&#xD;
" And why not ?" inquired Jean.&#xD;
" Listen to me," resumed Pierre, nervously ; "a moment ago as&#xD;
the young girl was about to write, I said to her something like this: 'if&#xD;
your mother is a Countess, are you not one too, my little woman?'&#xD;
'No,' said she to me, 'fathers alone give titles to their children,and&#xD;
my father was a poor man, who was killed upon Mount Cenis in guid-&#xD;
ing a French General.' "&#xD;
" My God !" exclaimed Jean, as the realization of his daily dreams&#xD;
flashed before his brain.&#xD;
" And what was his name ? I asked," continued Pierre, " and with.&#xD;
out hesitation she told me-Jean Thibaut."&#xD;
" It is my daughter-my Jane !" quoth the hackman in plenitude&#xD;
of joy, as he advanced towards the stairway.&#xD;
" Where are you going ?" interposed Pierre, stopping him.&#xD;
" Are you certain she spoke that name ?" again inquired the joy&#xD;
bewildered Jean, returning to his ancient comrade.&#xD;
" As sure as Jane," replied Pierre, " that the Countess d'Arezzo is&#xD;
no one but Genevieve."&#xD;
"Both living !" exclaimed Jean, raising his hands to Heaven in&#xD;
mute thanksgiving. " Yes, Pierre, I know now why Heaven has spared&#xD;
my life against cannon ball and grape shot--it was that at some future&#xD;
day, I should snatch my daughter from the jaws of death. What!&#xD;
this beautiful girl is the little babe I have nursed. Great God above,&#xD;
I am repaid for all my sorrow. Conduct me to her, let me see her !"&#xD;
Calm  yourself, Jean," remonstrated Pierre, as he noticed. the&#xD;
temporary delirium into vhich his friend had relapsed, "don't go on&#xD;
so ! look at me, see how cool I am."&#xD;
"But you are not her father," murmured Jean.&#xD;
" Am I not her god-father ?" argued the Savoyard, " she's my god-&#xD;
daughter-she's both our daughter."&#xD;
"Yes, my friend !" responded Jean, affectionately and rationally,&#xD;
"e have but one heart and one thought, dear little Pierre. And so&#xD;
the good God has conducted her to my Poor roof."&#xD;
Pierre could not withstand the expression of his comrade's confi-&#xD;
deuce, as he threw himself into his arms wild, while Jean wgnec k&#xD;
away the tears rollingr down his rugge d cheeks.&#xD;

" It was likewise a kind Heaven," continued Pierre, earnestly,&#xD;
" which inspired me to prevent you going to the commissary, for he&#xD;
'would have compelled all of us to appear, you, the Countess, and her&#xD;
step-father. And justice would have her eyes open wide, and would&#xD;
have found a woman again with two husbands like the pretty bar-&#xD;
woman, as you know,-and ten years of imprisonment."&#xD;
" But Genevieve is not guilty !" exclaimed Jean, " she thought me&#xD;
dead; she would not marry again, as Jane has said, only through de-&#xD;
votion for her daughter."&#xD;
" I know all that," responded Pierre, sagely, " still law is law ; you&#xD;
let her think you were dead when you were not. Beside Genevieve&#xD;
with you was poor ; with another she is rich and a Countess, and if&#xD;
they find out that her first husband lives--"&#xD;
"You are right," sternly said the hackm'an, " they would dishonor&#xD;
her ; still they shall know nothing about it. Still 1 dread that Gene-&#xD;
vieve will cause her own ruin-she will insist upon seeing him who&#xD;
has saved her child."&#xD;
"And should she see you," interrupted Pierre, cautiously, " danger&#xD;
may come of it."&#xD;
" Have no fear," firmly responded Jean, " for Genevieve will never&#xD;
see me again. I have been offered a post in Piedmont. I have the&#xD;
Colonel's card, who offered it to me. I will find him out and then see&#xD;
you."&#xD;
" Hush !" interrupted Pierre, "here she comes."&#xD;
And as the light, agile, and truly beautiful figure of Jane descended&#xD;
the stairway, the veteran exclaimed, in warmth of paternal pride :&#xD;
"It is, it is her, indeed !"&#xD;
" Monsieur Jean," quoth the young woman to the astounded, won-&#xD;
der-stricken hackmnan, " here is my letter."&#xD;
"I, Mademoiselle," said Pierre, advancing to her, " am  going to&#xD;
carry it. Jean, who commenced work so early, is fatigued, but I have&#xD;
slept late. Beside I am going to work, as every day I do a little upon&#xD;
the Quai Voltaire, which is but two steps from the Rue de Verneuil,&#xD;
and so you may rest assured that your letter will be delivered into&#xD;
the hands of the Countess."&#xD;
"I thank you in advance," gratefully said the maiden as she remit-&#xD;
ted the note gracefully into his hands.&#xD;
"Jean," quoti the Savoyard, advancing to the hackman, who seemed&#xD;
lost in deep meditation, " Eh ! my old Jean, won't you give me a&#xD;
shake of the hand before I go."                 1&#xD;
" Willingly," responded Jean, extending his hand.&#xD;
" You will not leave before my return,' whispered Pierre, so as not&#xD;
to be overheard by the beautiful damsel.&#xD;
" No !" replied Jean in a similar tone of voice, " 1 will wait until&#xD;
Mademoiselle Jane is asleep; I long, before I go, to kiss her as she&#xD;
sleeps."&#xD;
"'Here we go !" gaily said the Savoyard, as he lifted.upon his head&#xD;
the board loaded with the plaster images which had survived the sale.&#xD;
at the fete of St. Cloud.&#xD;

E All right !" ejaculated Jean, as he kindly steadied the board.&#xD;
" Now we're off !" quoth Pierre, with the shop resting firmly above&#xD;
him, " au revoir, Mademoiselle Jane ; be here shortly, Joan !' and&#xD;
the gay Savoyard, with his humble stock-in-trade, moved into the&#xD;
street, where his voice was soon heard, exhorting passers-by to pur-&#xD;
chase the unrivalled specimens of art he had for sale at marvellously&#xD;
low prices.&#xD;
Jane stood in silent meditation, and her face beamed in joy as she&#xD;
thought that her mother would soon have her letter, and on the mor-&#xD;
row she would be secreted in the hospitable mansion of the gallant&#xD;
Colonel Roger.&#xD;
"To-morrow," quoth Jean to himself in deep meditation likewise,&#xD;
"I will seek Colonel Roger, but I must first spend a few hours with&#xD;
my dearest long-lost daughter."&#xD;
" Monsieur Jean," interrupted the young girl, " are you going to be&#xD;
so kind as to spend some time with me ?"&#xD;
Yes, Mademoiselle," replied the hackman, " we will go into your&#xD;
room where there is a good fire burning."&#xD;
Jean took his daughter gently by the arm, the heart of the honest&#xD;
man filled to overflowing, and his suppressed joy could only find vent&#xD;
in a few straggling tear-drops.&#xD;
CHAPTER            XIII.&#xD;
A MOTHER'S SOLICITUDE.&#xD;
COLONEL ROGER was seated in his house in the rue de la 'Paix,&#xD;
reflecting over the contents of a letter purporting to come from his&#xD;
betrothed announcing her approaching arrival from Fontainebleau&#xD;
and her intention to conic to his house to secretly rejoin her mother.&#xD;
".I trust," so soliloquized the young soldier, " that a fresh departure&#xD;
will not intervene before our marriage, for the Count d'Arezzo has&#xD;
made a formal apology to me, overwhelmed me with compliments,&#xD;
and finally agreed to a reconciliation with his wife. How astonished&#xD;
will Jane be at ascertaining this marvellous change ! The emperor's&#xD;
letter has effected a miracle, and I am happy for it, for the five days of&#xD;
.Jane's absence appear to have been as many centuries."&#xD;
" I take the liberty of announcing myself at your service," respect-&#xD;
fully said a servant entering the apartment.&#xD;
" Ah, Benoit !" responded the Colonel, "I was waiting for you.&#xD;
Do you know the hour of the arrival of the diligence from Fontaine-&#xD;
bleau V-&#xD;
"Between twelve and one," replied the domestic.&#xD;
" Take my cabriolet," resumed the Colonel, "and drive to the office&#xD;
-you know the daughter of the Countess d'Arezzo ?"&#xD;
" I have seen her with her another frequently, Colonel," was the&#xD;
answer.&#xD;
' She will be a passenger doubtlessly, in the diligence," continued&#xD;

the soldier, "You will tell her that I have sent you in advance for&#xD;
her."&#xD;
The Colonel's sentence was cut off by a sharp ring at the bell.&#xD;
"News from the Rue de Verneuil; see who is there ?" quoth the&#xD;
domestic who almost immediately ushered in the Countess d'Arezzo.&#xD;
" Good morning, Madame," said the Colonel with an affectionate&#xD;
salutation, "now, Benoit, lose not a moment."&#xD;
The servant left the room, while the Countess, whose solicitude and&#xD;
agitation was apparent, seated herself by the Colonel.&#xD;
" I have many things to tell you," said the lady.&#xD;
Nothing disagreeable I hope," inquired the Colonel.&#xD;
"Quite the reverse," responded the Countess, " Good news."&#xD;
" I have sent it in advance to Mademoiselle Jane," resumed the&#xD;
soldier.&#xD;
She will be here in two hours," quoth the Countess, " the dili-&#xD;
gence arrives at half past twelve."&#xD;
" Now, Madame, I can listen to you-" resumed the Colonel as he ar-&#xD;
ranged his papers on the table and took a seat opposite to her.&#xD;
You must know that when you quitted the mansion last evening,"&#xD;
commenced the lady, " you left me in conversation with the Count."&#xD;
" Yes, Madame,'' nervously interrupted the young Colonel.&#xD;
" We talked for a long while about Jane," resumed the Countess.&#xD;
" I have found the Count embarrassed or rather repentant, after accu-&#xD;
sing himself of a coldness, involuntary on his part, or rather irre-&#xD;
flection, he passed a eulogy upon you, and he said he would be happy,&#xD;
for the sake of a reconciliation with her, to hastei your nuptials by&#xD;
giving a consent he had hitherto witheld."&#xD;
It is preferable both for our reputation and his own," responded&#xD;
the soldier, " that the marriage be arn aged amicably."&#xD;
" You are right, Henri," resumed the Countess, " and in the hope of&#xD;
attaining that object, I have announced to the Count that to-day - hope&#xD;
to meet Jane."&#xD;
"But," interrupted the Colonel, " you did not communicate to&#xD;
him the contents of the letter."&#xD;
" Oh, no 1" warmly replied the lady ; " I could not ; the bearer of&#xD;
the note forbid such a movement; so I invented a little falsehood. I&#xD;
told him that when Jane left for about ten days of absence, she had&#xD;
upon our separation agreed to return secretly to embrace me at Paris&#xD;
and that we were to meet on the fifth at your house -which is to-day&#xD;
-that Jane, faithful to her promise, arrived here to pass an hour with&#xD;
meand that I, by announcing the happy resolution of her father-in-&#xD;
law, could prevent her from leaving again."&#xD;
"'Very good, indeed," exclaimed the delighted Roger.&#xD;
" The Count," proceeded the lady, "upon hearing that I anticipated&#xD;
seeing Jane to-day, could not, restrain his emotions, and has given me&#xD;
authority to unite his requests with ours in a word, he is coming here,&#xD;
and I have hurried to let you know of the arrangement in advance."&#xD;
"Malame, " gleefully observed the colonel, " everything works&#xD;
well."&#xD;

"Now," continued the Countess, " I have let you know of my an-&#xD;
ticipation, let me explain my inquietude."&#xD;
" What can- it be ?" interposed the young man anxiously.&#xD;
" I cannot define them," responded the lady, " but they are based&#xD;
upon this letter of Jane's-perceive how singularly it is sealed."&#xD;
" It is not easy," remarked the Colonel, after examining the seal,&#xD;
to find allnecessary writing materials at a village inn."&#xD;
"Still, Jane," continued the Countess, " carries a seal, attached to&#xD;
her watch, which is engraved with her initials-besides, see how the&#xD;
hand writing trembles."&#xD;
So it does," corroborated the Colonel.&#xD;
" And further listen to the sonbre style of the composition," re-&#xD;
marked the Countess as she read :&#xD;
" Dear Mother-I cannot live away from you and yet I dread to&#xD;
encounter the Count, that man who would cause our death, were not&#xD;
Providence to watch over us."&#xD;
"You perceive," observed the Countess, pausing in her reading,&#xD;
"it would be impossible to exhibit this to the Count."&#xD;
" Certainly, it would re-awaken his enmity," replied Roger, as the&#xD;
lady continued with the epistle:&#xD;
" Towards the middle of the day, I will arrive at the dwelling of&#xD;
the Colonel ; hasten to precede me there, and think in advance of&#xD;
some means for my concealment, where you can console the poor&#xD;
daughter who loves thee so dearly.                    JANE."&#xD;
"That letter was conceived in a profound state of melancholy," he&#xD;
remarked, as the sound of a carriage called him to the window. "It is&#xD;
the Count ; conceal the letter while I go to receive-he Count d'-&#xD;
Arezzo."&#xD;
"Henri is right," soliloquized the Countess, as she concealed the&#xD;
note and took off her h t and shawl. " The Count would gain no-&#xD;
thing, but lose all, by deceiving us. I know the reason, but I an&#xD;
tormented despite myself; I would to Heaven the day was passedd"&#xD;
i" Gentlemen, enter," quoth the Colonel, ushering in the Count and&#xD;
his inseparable companion, the Florentine forger-; "the Countess&#xD;
whsp is ready here, awaits your coning."  .&#xD;
Colonel," said the Count, entering the apartment, "I have taken&#xD;
the liberty of being accompanied by my friend, Monsieur Morel,,&#xD;
who, as you will hereafter judge, may be useful to us."&#xD;
"You are welcome, sir," responded. the Colonel politely.&#xD;
" Colonel, you really do me very great honor," quoth the Floren-&#xD;
tine with obsequious humility.&#xD;
" My step-daughter has not yet a'rived?" remarked d'Arezzo.&#xD;
"She will not be long behind us," responded the Countess.&#xD;
-" My dear Count," warmly spoke the yonng soldier, " the Countess&#xD;
has filled my head with joy by announcing to me you good-disposi-&#xD;
tion with regard to us---"&#xD;

opposition to this union," returned the Count with affected disinter-&#xD;
estedness, " and I have deemed. it proper to crush them by accele-&#xD;
rating its consummation. It is therefore necessary to enter upon&#xD;
some important examinations; and therefore I have brought with me&#xD;
Monsieur Morel, who will present you with the balance sheet of my&#xD;
account of Jane's guardianship."&#xD;
"Here are the documents," said Morel, producing them.&#xD;
For my part, gentlemen," quoth the frank soldier, "my fortune&#xD;
is open to inspection. The Emperor Napoleon, to reward the father&#xD;
in the person of the son, has conferred upon him the forests of Pied-&#xD;
mont; to it he has added the pension of my rank, and a little pleasure&#xD;
mansion, which has been bought since my return to Paris."&#xD;
" Colonel," interposed Morel, " the marriage contract of the Count&#xD;
d'Arezzo proves that the estate of Mademoiselle Jane was, at the&#xD;
period of his taking charge of it, valued at twelve hundred thousand&#xD;
livre. Had the speculation of tife Count turned out always profitable&#xD;
this fortune would have been doubled during the past twelve years,&#xD;
but it has progressed in a proportion which you can determine and&#xD;
appreciate only by examining the accounts which I place at your dis-.&#xD;
posal."&#xD;
" In the evening I will charge my notary with their examination&#xD;
and with drawing up the marriage contract," responded the Colonel,&#xD;
placing the documents in the hands of his secretary. " I think I hear&#xD;
some one walking in the adjoining apartment.&#xD;
" It is doubtlessly my daughter," said the Countess, rising in agita-&#xD;
tion, as the Count and Morel likewise quitted their seats. The hopes&#xD;
of the mother were disappointed ; it was but Benoit who returned&#xD;
and spoke to his master.&#xD;
"The daughter of the Countess," replied the domestic aloud in re-&#xD;
sponse to a question of the lady, " was not in the diligence from Fon-&#xD;
tainebleau."&#xD;
"Are y ou quite certain?" interrupted the Count, with a significant&#xD;
glance at his companion--the counterfeiter.&#xD;
"The diligence brought but three persons, and Mademoiselle Jane&#xD;
was not among them."&#xD;
"There are other coaches which stop at Fontainebleau, which like-&#xD;
wise take passengers."&#xD;
"The diligences from Lyons and Orleans, but they will not arriv-e&#xD;
before evening" returned the domestic.&#xD;
" Very wei!' responded the Colonel as the domestic left the room.&#xD;
"I cannot explain this delay," quoth the Countess, with evident&#xD;
uneasiness of manner.&#xD;
" If Mademoiselle Jane was to have left Fontaineleau this morning,&#xD;
it is to be presumed that she has taken the post coach," interposed&#xD;
Morel.&#xD;
"In that case she would have arrived sooner," interrupted the&#xD;
Countess.&#xD;
" Doubtlessly," remarked the Colonel, likewise uneasy.&#xD;
" I have a presentiment of some misfortune," said the Countess;&#xD;
" I must leave, and go find it out."&#xD;
&#xD;
ii&#xD;
E&#xD;
&#xD;
"Be not tremulous concerning her, madame," interrupted the&#xD;
Count. " Reflect for a moment that your daughter has agreed to re-&#xD;
turn to Paris in five days, that is to-day, and some very trivial inci-&#xD;
dent may have detained her."&#xD;
"Hark, some one at the door !" exclaimed henri.&#xD;
" It must be her !" ejaculated the Countess sorrowfully.&#xD;
" I humbly trust it is," replied the Colonel, who gallantly proffered&#xD;
his arm to the tremulous mother, and led her forth to welcome her&#xD;
child, should she have arrived.&#xD;
C H A P T E R XIV.&#xD;
RESUScITATION        OF THE DEAD.&#xD;
" Tun moment of dissimulation has nrived, Morel," quoth the&#xD;
Count to his companion in iniquity, when alone.&#xD;
The Countess will doubtlessly proceed to Fontainebleau," remark-&#xD;
ed Morel, in a whisper to his companion.&#xD;
" Or rather to Chaillot," observed the Count.&#xD;
" The Colonel," said Morel, " will not have time to occupy himself&#xD;
with his notary or with the accounts which you dictated."&#xD;
" Happily not," returned the Venitian.&#xD;
" The Countess will soon be informed of her misfortune," continued&#xD;
Morel ; " I commence to tremble already."&#xD;
" Why so ?" inquired the Count.&#xD;
From fear suspicion iay fall upon us," replied Morel.&#xD;
" The disappearance of the jewels will remove every suspicion from&#xD;
us," returned the Italian.&#xD;
" Still you are the heir of Jane-" resumed the forger.&#xD;
In faith, a good reason, that !" interrupted the Count. " Think, we&#xD;
are in our own apartments, seen by our servants, at half past ten,&#xD;
and within an hour afterwards we were served by them in the same&#xD;
apartment. whence none saw us go out."&#xD;
"That is true !" remarked Morel with satisfaction.&#xD;
"So much towards an alibi !" rejoined the Count ; " and now the&#xD;
fatal hour approaches--it causes me a fever, which will be mistaken&#xD;
for agitation arising from  grief-Hark, they come ! now put a good&#xD;
face upon the matter."&#xD;
" God be praised !" exclaimed the 'Colonel upon his entrance,&#xD;
" here is your step-daughter."&#xD;
S" My step-daughter !" ejaculated the Venetian with a vacant stare&#xD;
of incredulity.&#xD;
" Yes, father !" quoth Jane, as the Count stood petrified and his&#xD;
brother culprit trembled from head to foot.&#xD;
" They tell me," meekly resumed Jane, " that you have consented&#xD;
to sanction our nuptials--nay, you do not reply ?"&#xD;
Excuse me," stammered forth the Count, trembling as if he&#xD;

beheld an apparition fron the grave, " we were all--yes, all were--&#xD;
uneasy-"&#xD;
" Our inquietude have vanished," replied the young girl, unsuspi-&#xD;
ciously ; " embrace me, father."&#xD;
The Count, almost ready to faint, leaned forward and kissed his&#xD;
daughter upon her forehead, who turned, after his embrace to her&#xD;
not her.&#xD;
" Mother, Henri !" affectionately quoth the maiden, tear-drops&#xD;
standing in her eyes, " I am happy in being with you-I have suffered&#xD;
so much, while I was away from you."&#xD;
"Suffered !" ejaculated the Countess, " why not send for me?"&#xD;
"I could not, mother," replied the girl.&#xD;
"But where was Ambroise ?" inquired the anxious parent.&#xD;
I have not seen him," returned the maiden.&#xD;
Not seen him !" ejaculated the astonished Countess.&#xD;
" The absence of Ambroise," replied the girl, " caused me to be&#xD;
the victim of a misfortune, so terrible, that I would not have men-&#xD;
tioned it had I not contracted a debt which all of us must join in&#xD;
repaying."&#xD;
"1 tremble from head to foot," sighed the Countess.&#xD;
A misfortune !" inquired the Count in dissimulation.&#xD;
" Ambroise came not to meet me," continued Jane, "and I&#xD;
continued along toward Chaillot ; 1 trembled, for the long way grew&#xD;
more and more deserted, when profiting by my isolation two men in&#xD;
3nasks threw themselves upon ne."&#xD;
Great Heavens !" ejaculated the Countess.&#xD;
" Stricken by terror," Jane proceeded, " I became insensible in&#xD;
their hands, when the two wretches, doubtlessly to annihilate the&#xD;
evidence of their crime, threw me into the Seine.-&#xD;
" Thou ! my daughter !" exclaimed the Countess, clasping her&#xD;
arms around her most affectionately-&#xD;
" Weep not, mother !" soothingly resumed the damsel, " I am here&#xD;
with you again ; weep not, for Providence has saved thy child-"&#xD;
" By what miracle ?" exclaimed Henri.&#xD;
" What passed for three days," continued Jane, I know not, for&#xD;
during that time my reason wandered, but after that the light of in-&#xD;
telleet returning to me, casually through the intervals of fever, 1 dis-&#xD;
covered that a passer-by--a haekman, thme best and most courageous&#xD;
otf men, -had dragged me fi'omn the water at the peril of his own lite,&#xD;

" The mrme of this noble maim ?" ingmired the Countess.&#xD;

"IL is mY own, let him await a mmniiieut," said the Colonel ; after the&#xD;
servant had gone out, he discovered some writing upon the back.&#xD;
" What is this," he continued, as he read : " I have reflected, Colonel,&#xD;
and beg of you to accord to ne, as soon as possible, the place of for-&#xD;
est guard in Piedmont, which you have promised me."&#xD;
Turning to Jane, the Colonel whispered: " It is the Mountaineer!"&#xD;
Advancing to- the Counitess, who had put on her hat and shawl, the&#xD;
Colonel said to her gily :" Madame, remain ; the man who sent this&#xD;

"Monsieur Jeaii, come in !&#xD;
"Excuse me," quoth Jean, who had entered the apartment unaware&#xD;
of other persons being lpr'esent, " you have company, I will retire."&#xD;
" Nay," said the soldier, kindiv restraining his departure, " there&#xD;

" Carry me hence," murmured the Countess, in a state of semi-con-&#xD;
sciousness. The Colonel hastily opened the door of an inner apart-&#xD;
ment, and conducted the trembling lady within it, accompanied by&#xD;
her equally agitated daughter, but not, however, until her lips whis-&#xD;
pered the solemn words: " Jean Claude still lives !"&#xD;
The Count paced the room in meditation ; a fresh enigma was pre-&#xD;
sented for solution, and for a moment he was at a loss to comprehend&#xD;
the reason why the presence of this obscure man could exert so pow-&#xD;
erful an influence upon the emotions of his wife.&#xD;
"Wretched man as I am !" murmured Jean, in a paroxysm of grief&#xD;
which seized upon his sensitive soul.&#xD;
" Jean!" quoth the Count, " styled the Mountaineer."&#xD;
"Your star is accursed !" whispered Morel to his companion.&#xD;
Perhaps," whispered the Venetian in return, " but, Morel, leave&#xD;
me alone with this hackman, go!."&#xD;
Morel gazed for a moment upon them both, and murmured to him-&#xD;
self: " what can he hope to do now ?" and with this observation, he&#xD;
took his departure from the chamber..&#xD;
"I must haste to leave this house," muttered Jean, advancing to&#xD;
wards the door with a moody, melancholic step.&#xD;
" Stop, sir !" interposed the Count, " I cannot let you go thus ; I&#xD;
owe you a tribute of gratitude ; I am the father-in-law of Jane."&#xD;
" Ah! you are the man, then !" said Jean, with a gesture of con-&#xD;
tempt.&#xD;
" Yes," continued the Count in a familiar manner, "I became the&#xD;
second husband of Genevieve Thibaut, widow of the father of this&#xD;
young lady."&#xD;
" You have then gained," responded Jean most tranquilly. "a very&#xD;
kind, gentle girl, and very beautiful."&#xD;
" I owe her return to you," resumed the Count in a tone of perfect.&#xD;
dissimulation, " and therefore-I desire--[ pray of you that you will&#xD;
consider my.house, as I may say, as your own."&#xD;
" Unfortunately," replied the hackman, "I an about to quit France."&#xD;
" Soon ?" inquired the Count.&#xD;
"In an hour," responded, " My comrades are waiting for me."&#xD;
" But the Countess will be inconsolable," interrupted the Italian, Itif&#xD;
you g6 hence without her being abloto thank you, you see; I will go&#xD;
and let her know."&#xD;
" No !" quoth Jean, attempting to stop his movement. "I wish to&#xD;
tell you that I am an old soldier, very rough at that, and I know not&#xD;
the way of talking to your high-bred ladies-I would rather go, and&#xD;
you can arrange all the rest."&#xD;
" It is impossible," said the Count, " here comes the Countess ; she&#xD;
will accuse me if I suffer you to leave without her seeing you, and-&#xD;
not to annoy you-I will leave you together alone.'&#xD;

CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
THE TEST OF LOVE.&#xD;
THE heart of the Mountaineer beat rapidly as the Count made a&#xD;
sign as if going through one of the doors as the Countess entered&#xD;
throu h another. Instead, however, of leaving the 'apartment, the&#xD;
wily Venetian mer elf glided behind one of the curtains, whose dam&#xD;
ask folds concealed the windows.&#xD;
" Pardon me," said the Countess in a half-stifled voice, " if my&#xD;
emotion at first paralyzed my speech ;" then casting her eyes about&#xD;
her, she continued, " Where is the'Count ?"&#xD;
" le is there," responded the hackman, gazing around the room,&#xD;
when not being able to see him, he murmured to himself; "is he con.&#xD;
cealed somewhere ?"&#xD;
" He is listening to us," whispered the lady, "I heard the curtain&#xD;
shake."&#xD;
"Let us be upon our guard ?" quotrh Jean cautiously.&#xD;
"Without you, sir," commenced the Countess, her eyes intently&#xD;
fixed upon the curtain, "the mother who now speaks to you would be&#xD;
dying with grief."&#xD;
"You would have been very much distressed," calmly responded&#xD;
the Mountaineer, "had the young woman perished:"&#xD;
" I would," proceeded the Countess, " that my gratitude could equal&#xD;
the courage displayed by you in saving her from death."&#xD;
"Oh, my courage !" tranquilly answered Jean, " why, you see,&#xD;
Madam - that would be a'good deal for some people, and nothing for&#xD;
others. When a man has been twelve years a soldier, when he has&#xD;
marched across battle-fields, exposed to every kind of peril, then he&#xD;
learns the necessity of aiding his fellow-creatures ; of picking up one&#xD;
who has fallen, or of tendering the hand 5to one who is down--and&#xD;
you may say that, without forethought, Providence impels some to&#xD;
assist others."&#xD;
" Oh, you are right," interrupted the Countess, " the ways of&#xD;
heaven are unfathomable mysteries, which humble the strong and&#xD;
succor the weak, which unite and--separate."&#xD;
" We are certainly overheard," whispered Jean as he mastered his&#xD;
emotions.&#xD;
" Yes," continued the Countess as she drew a medallion from her&#xD;
bosom. " Providence teaches us to bless a man to-day, of whom we&#xD;
knew nothing the day before."&#xD;
While she spoke, she directed the attention of the Mountaineer to&#xD;

&#xD;
a medallion of pewter, which the Alpine Guide had bestowed upon&#xD;
his wife upon his return from the Grand Bourge many years before.&#xD;
Upon the sight of this relic, Jean, who was about to speak, suddenly&#xD;
become mute, while the tears coursed rapidly down the cheek of the&#xD;
unhappy lady.&#xD;
" Have you children, Monsieur Jean ?" inquired the Countess.'&#xD;
" No, madam, I have never been married," replied the Mountain-&#xD;
eer  " An orphan frominfancy, I have ever been alone in the world."&#xD;
The Mountaineer drew from his bosom the counterpart of the mne&#xD;
dallion, and secretly exhibited it to Genevieve.&#xD;
"Since you have no child upon whom I can shower.my gratitude,"&#xD;
resumed the Countess, " it is with you, Monsieur Jean, that I must&#xD;
settle my debt aind obligation."&#xD;
" I understand, Madam," replied Jean, disguising his feeling by an&#xD;
outburst of laughter, while the tears trickled down his rugged cheeks;&#xD;
" you would pay me for what I have done; well, I accept the offer,&#xD;
only I don't know how much it was worth."-&#xD;
" First take this purse," said the Countess, drawing forth a purse&#xD;
which at first he hesitated about taking, but finally accepted.&#xD;
" This purse is indeed a heavy one," said Jean. as he jingled its&#xD;
contents ; " after all, it is perhaps but the price of service.&#xD;
" With this gold I will have a glorious revel; [ will spend it with-&#xD;
out remorse, for I have no family."&#xD;
" Poor Jean Claude !" murmured the lady.&#xD;
"I will assemble my companions," continued Jean, " and we will&#xD;
recommence the celebration of Saint Medard, fete of hackmen, and&#xD;
we will drink, for the Mountaineer stands the shot, to the health of&#xD;
Mademoitelle, as well as yours. Ever thanking the Countess, I have&#xD;
the honor of saluting you."&#xD;
The Countess made an attempt to restrain his departure, but Jean&#xD;
insisted that his absence was requisite, as he was on the verge of a&#xD;
journey... The Countess heaved a deep sigh, and with her eyes filled&#xD;
with tears, disappeared through the doorway, announcing her deter-&#xD;
mination to summon her daughter.&#xD;
"Poor Genevieve !" murmured Jean, sorrowfully, " wealth has&#xD;
not given her happiness."&#xD;
"1It is not him'!" quoth the Count to himself. " Besides, he alluded&#xD;
to his journey, and is waiting to see Jane again."&#xD;
" She was right !" meditated Jean, without noticing the Count.&#xD;
" Heaven has mysterious ways ;-ah t the Count is listening ; I&#xD;
was well aware that he' was in that game."&#xD;
" So you have seen the Countess," inquired the Italian.  .&#xD;
"Yes, sir," responded the hackman, concealing his emotions.&#xD;
" How excited he is," quoth the Count internally as he crossed in&#xD;
front of Jean to assume a seat upon the lounge, " 1 am not quite cer-&#xD;
tain, yet-it may be possible that instead of remaining among the&#xD;
dead, Jean Claude has arisen to avenge himself. He must submit to&#xD;
another test."&#xD;
" Monsieur Jean," exclaimed Jane, entering the apartment, " they&#xD;
told me you wished to speak to ine."&#xD;

67&#xD;
&#xD;
Yes, mademoiselle," replied the hackman.&#xD;
And I have so many things to tell you !" responded the girl&#xD;
" You waste your time, Miss," interposed the Count, arising from&#xD;
the lounge and placing himself between the speakers; " for Monsieur&#xD;
Jean his but a few moments to spare, and I wish .to take advantage&#xD;
of them, for I have something serious to speak of to him."&#xD;
Wita ine ?" ejaculated Jean.&#xD;
Yes, with you," returned the Venitian.&#xD;
Can you imagine," interrupted the maiden, "that I have nothing&#xD;
serious to say to him-yes, sir, I I"&#xD;
"I do not seek," responded the Count, speaking violently, "to rob&#xD;
you of an opportunity. I beg you to withdraw, and will wait until&#xD;
you are gone."&#xD;
"But, sir," remonstrated Jane.&#xD;
"In a word !" exclaimed, the Count, imperatively, "your father&#xD;
commands you--obey-begone !"&#xD;
"You are not my father," responded the maiden, indignantly,&#xD;
knoww it well, Miss," sarcastically resumed the nobleman," in that&#xD;
I have committed an irrevocable fault-in receiving you into my&#xD;
house, in becoming the husband of your mother-,concealing beneath&#xD;
a noble title the shame and ignominy of a prior marriage."&#xD;
" Shame !" exclaimed the young woman; "shame ! there was no-&#xD;
thing shameful in my mother's marriage-my father was poor, it is&#xD;
true-"&#xD;
So poor,' interrupted the Count, " that he was a beggar !"&#xD;
The hackman, however, was sufficiently keen-witted to catch the&#xD;
drift of the Count's assumed anger, so he leisurely retired to a distance,&#xD;
whence he endeavored to catch the eye of the young- woman to put&#xD;
her on her guard.&#xD;
"A beggar ." exclaimed Jane haughtily, " It is false !"&#xD;
"A t least I have been told so," remarked the Count.&#xD;
My father," continued the maiden, excitedly, " was indeed a poor&#xD;
man, a guide in the mountains, who walked night and day, frequently&#xD;
upon his bare feet, to earn money to nourish his household, which he&#xD;
blessed by his presence. There are others, Count, like you, soulless,&#xD;
heartless-&#xD;
Jane," interrupted the noble, "you weary my patience."&#xD;
Heartless man," continued the girl, not heeding his interruption,&#xD;
who outrage both the living and the dead,"&#xD;

Whose presence is a cirse," resumed the damsel.&#xD;
Mademoiselle'!" ejaculated the Count in a frenzy of rage, rushing&#xD;
at the girl as if to strike.&#xD;
"Count !-sir-I never," interrupted Jean, throwing himself in&#xD;
front of the Italian with a demonstration of forcibly resenting any&#xD;
personal violence offered to the trembling Jane.&#xD;
"What do you want ?" calmly inquired the Venetian.&#xD;
'Nohing" .responded the hackman mastering his anger-and at-&#xD;
tempting to smile, "I have a bad habit of mingling with other peo-&#xD;

"It is truly Jean Claude," murmured the Count to himself.&#xD;
" I saw you lift your hand," continued Jean, going up td the Count&#xD;
and attempting to excuse his conduct, " and then my bad habit came&#xD;
upon me-I as I told you, always meddle in what don't concern me ;&#xD;
I ought to have gone-I will go now."  Then reflecting that Jane&#xD;
might not be safe when left unprotected, the mountaineer proceeded&#xD;
to address her: " Mademoiselle, it would be better for you to retire&#xD;
-the Count is angry."&#xD;
" He shows an interest in her safety," murmured the Count.&#xD;
" Retire, I beg of you," continued Jean.&#xD;
"But, Monsieur Jean," hesitatingly replied the girl.&#xD;
" For my sake, do retire," solicited the mountaineer, " as a favor."&#xD;
" For you, as a favor to you, Monsieur Jean, I withdraw ;" thus&#xD;
speaking the young girl left the apartment, kissing her hand as if in&#xD;
adieu to the warm-hearted Coachman. Jean turned around, and rapidly,&#xD;
wiped away a tear falling from his eyes.&#xD;
" He has wept," exclaimed the Count, "he wipes away tears."&#xD;
"I have truly asked your pardon," continued the Mountaineer, " I&#xD;
did not intend offence-but I was excited ! was wrong'! I am. as&#xD;
harmless as a chicken, but when a young woman is threatened then-.&#xD;
I-I break something-i'll be going."&#xD;
Jean the Mountaineer without further ado precipitately departed&#xD;
from, the chamber, while the Count clapped his hands in undisguised&#xD;
glee, as he gave vent to an exclamation: " She is a bigamist ; I am&#xD;
saved !"&#xD;
CHAPTER X V I .&#xD;
GENEvIEvE, AGAIN!&#xD;
S"WHAT a curious idea of the Count," muttered Simon, as he ar&#xD;
ranged the recept'on-chambers of the Mansion d'Arezzo in the rue de&#xD;
Verneuil, " who ordered me, should a hackman call, to show him into&#xD;
the parlor."&#xD;
"Yes," quoth Jean, speaking to himself, " I did right in responding&#xD;
to the summons of the Count. I cannot leave Paris, yet; my flight&#xD;
would doubtless augment the suspicions he entertains. What can he&#xD;
want of me I"&#xD;
As the hackman meditated he seated himself pensively on one of&#xD;
the large arm chairs standing in the centre of the chamber.&#xD;
" He takes things easy," murmured Simon, advancing to Jean, and&#xD;
touching him upon the shoulder ; " Coacher, just get up or you will&#xD;
spoil these arm chairs."&#xD;
" Pardon," quoth Jean, still in a pensive mood, passing to another&#xD;
in a different part of the saloon.&#xD;
" He takes the arm-chair for a box seat," ironically murmured Si-&#xD;
mon as he dusted off the article of furniture.&#xD;

"Again !" exclaimed Simon on entering, Jean assumed another&#xD;
seat ; "It is scarce worth the trouble of making you get up if you go&#xD;
from one to another;"&#xD;
"Excuse me," responded Jean, still in a brown study, "I did not pay&#xD;
attention-I was thinking," and Jean walked about in a state of ab-&#xD;
straction.&#xD;
"I wonder how the Count will suffer," muttered Simon, as he dust.-&#xD;
ed off the second chair, " such people as these to come into this sa-&#xD;
loon.&#xD;
"Happily," continued Jean, walking around as-he followed his train&#xD;
of thought, "none save Genevieve and Pierre know that Jean Claude&#xD;
is still in the land of the living---.."&#xD;
You didn't wipe your feet before coming upon this carpet," in-&#xD;
terrupted Simon, again advancing to the Mountaineer.&#xD;
'  Yes," responded Jean, looking at his feat, " I am rather dusty,&#xD;
for I have walked a considerable distance."&#xD;
"Then go and wait in the ante-chamber," gruffly commanded the&#xD;
domestic.&#xD;
"Just as you please," responded Jean ; " which way ?"&#xD;
"File this way," replied Simon, taking him by the shoulder.&#xD;
"Hullo !" quoth Jean, remarking him seriously for the first time,&#xD;
"you are a lacquey, you ?"&#xD;
" I am head valet of the house," returned Simon.&#xD;
" Head valet, eh ?" retorted Jean, displacing all the chairs within&#xD;
his reach; "arrange this furniture, earn your wages and hold your&#xD;
tongue.&#xD;
" Do you think," exclaimed the astounded valet, arranging the&#xD;
chairs in their places, "I'm here to wait upon you ?"&#xD;
" Simon ?" quoth the Countess, " my daughter requires you."&#xD;
" The Countess !" ejaculated the Mountaineer, taking off his hat re-&#xD;
spectfully and holding it in his hand.&#xD;
" You are doubtless astonished, Madame," said Simon to the Coun-&#xD;
tess, "to find this man here in this saloon, but it is by order of the&#xD;
Count." Thus speaking he left the room.&#xD;
"Jean Claude," resumed the Countess, after having closed the&#xD;
doors, "we are now alone."&#xD;
" Imprudent woman !" ejaculated the hackman,&#xD;
" The Count has been unexpectedly called to the Treasury," ex-&#xD;
.claimed the lady.&#xD;
l He can return and surprise us," remarked Jean.&#xD;
"Some one is on the watch !" returned the Countess.&#xD;
"But should we be betrayed ?" observed the hackman.&#xD;
" Our guardian will never betray us," rejoined the lady.&#xD;
"Depart, I pray of you," implored Jean, " for I have lost confidence&#xD;
in all mankind."&#xD;
"In Petit Pierre !" naively inquired the Countess.&#xD;
"In him, I have," gaily replied the veteran.&#xD;
" He has worked his way to me," resumed the Countess," he watches&#xD;
en one side, your. daughter upon the other."&#xD;

"They will be faithful to their trust," replied the hackman.&#xD;
" I have desired," resumed the lady, " to profit by this hour, when-&#xD;
ever we will be without witnesses, for that, before being uneasy as to&#xD;
the estimation of the world at large, 1 desire to secure that of Jean&#xD;
Claude."&#xD;
" Madame !" exclaimed Jean.&#xD;
" For a long time, I swear it," proceeded the Countess, " although&#xD;
having the proof of your death before me; I lived as in a bewildered&#xD;
dream. While awaiting an impossible return, while awaiting the sole&#xD;
riches of the soul, affection and confidence, I regretted my sudden&#xD;
prosperity. But passing days destroyed my hopes, and realized the&#xD;
bitterness of my disappointment. At the end of five years I saw&#xD;
the future of my child menaced, and on her account solely I was forced&#xD;
to sacrifice myself and accept the name of another  "&#xD;
"Seek not to justify yourself," interrupted J ean' Claude, " I am&#xD;
aware of the deepness of your sorrows."'&#xD;
"You !" ejaculated the Countess in surprise.&#xD;
"I was miraculously saved," rejoined the Mountaineer; "I hastened&#xD;
to our home; there I learned that my presence would tear you from&#xD;
the titles and wealth of your ancestors ; yes, upon the very day when&#xD;
you came in grief to bid farewell to Petit Pierre. Jean Claude in&#xD;
concealment, not able to restrain the impulse of .his heart, was about&#xD;
to throw himself at your feet, when I overheard you say that opu-&#xD;
lence might prove the salvation to our child then, Jean Claude, who.&#xD;
had courage to preserve silence, was prostrated in grief at the thought&#xD;
of leaving you a widow and an heiress."&#xD;
" Unfortunate man !" returned the Countess, " if you only knew&#xD;
how many torments wealth has occasioned me, how envy of my&#xD;
portion engendered hatred, how much, in fact, I suffered daily !"&#xD;
" I likewise," interrupted the hackman, " have shed many tears-&#xD;
have eat hard bread, and counted hours of wretchedness, still my&#xD;
little Jane was in refuge against the blasts of autumn and the colds&#xD;
of winter. Hence, while the mother was in sorrow, and the Lather&#xD;
dragged his wounded limbs on the battle-field, the child has grown up&#xD;
beneath a genial sun."&#xD;
" And it was for her," responded the Countess, " that thou. hast ac-&#xD;
cepted isolation and misery ; pardon me for having accused thy cour-&#xD;
age and thy will-thou, the only husband of Genevieve, thou, the&#xD;
martyr she has wept for in silence."&#xD;
The Countess leaned upon the shoulder of her husband, and wept&#xD;
most profoundly.&#xD;
" Genevieve !" exclaimed the mountaineer firmly, as he wiped away&#xD;
the tears from her eyes, " now that you are Countess, I'll tell you&#xD;
that which you have to do. If the Count could assure himself of the&#xD;
existence of your first husband he would probably institute proceed-&#xD;
ings against you, perchance with success, for men cannot rightly in-&#xD;
terpret a silence which has preserved wealth unto you. Still, that&#xD;
may not take place ;. when I followed the army, rather for death than&#xD;
glory, I was aware that the revelation of the name of Thibaut might&#xD;

-a&#xD;

&#xD;
ruin you, therefore I volunteered under the name of Jean, the child&#xD;
of accident. I have never pronounced the name of my mother, nor&#xD;
that of Jean Claude Thibaut-come what may, you would be unaware&#xD;
of my existence, and could remain a widow in security."&#xD;
" Yes," interposed the Countess, "but Jean the Mountaineer has&#xD;
saved the life of my daughter. Have I no right to see him ?"&#xD;
" As soon as it is proven," cautiously returned Jean, "that Jean&#xD;
Claude Thibaut is no longer in this world."&#xD;
" The Count approaches the hotel," quoth Pierre, entering from one&#xD;
of the lower doors with precipitation.&#xD;
" Already ?" exclaimed the Countess.&#xD;
"Fly !" said Jean, leading her to the door of the apartment.&#xD;
" [ go," returned the Countess, "remember, Jean Claude, that while&#xD;
the Countess, must resist, Genevieve, from the bottom of her heart&#xD;
invokes blessings upon you. Farewell."&#xD;
And the lady retired rapidly from the saloon.&#xD;
"You know, old fellow," said Pierre to his comrade, " where to find&#xD;
me. I am under the coach yard gate with my shop. If there is any&#xD;
need of me, first a sign, and I'm here."&#xD;
" I will reckon upon you," replied Jean.&#xD;
" I always carry a good cudgel," resumed Pierre, "for we don't&#xD;
know when it is necessary to use it."&#xD;
"Oh, no," replied Jean, "no violence here."&#xD;
" Well, as you will," responded Pierre, " but it won't do to be&#xD;
beaten without a return. Here comes the rascal, and I'm of;" then&#xD;
halting near the door, he continued, "you know, if needs be, you will&#xD;
find me."&#xD;
"You will be where ?" inquired the hackman.&#xD;
"Under the gate-way," replied the Savoyard, "by the side of the&#xD;
watch-dog."&#xD;
CHAPTER XVII,&#xD;
AN INKLING OF THE TRUTH.&#xD;
"PIERRE and Genevieve !" exclaimed Jean, as he was left alone&#xD;
after the departure of his guardian angel of the plaster image store,&#xD;
"just as they were twenty years ago. Come, I must drive every kind&#xD;
emotion from my heart. I must arm myself with restraint and dis-&#xD;
trust, and take care -tb disembarrass myself with everything which&#xD;
can compromise me."&#xD;
"You will watch in the vestibule," said the Count, entering with Si-&#xD;
mon, to whom he gave his hat. and cloak, " and as soon as Colonel&#xD;
Roger calls, you will tell him I am impatient to see him, and show&#xD;
him at once into'the saloon."&#xD;
"Good !" said the domestic, retiring into the vestibule.&#xD;
"You have been told, Monsieur," quoth the Venetian, "  Tse1y&#xD;
aired to see you."&#xD;

72                 THE   ALPINE    GUIDE.&#xD;
"I have come hither," frankly responded the mountaineer, "to see&#xD;
what you wanted of me."&#xD;
" Have you no suspicions ?" asked the Count.&#xD;
" None whatever," replied Jean.&#xD;
"I sent for you to inquire," continued the Italian, " what sum of&#xD;
money you received of your wife to consent to pass as dead."&#xD;
" I !" responded the Mountaineer, "my wife !-I don't understand&#xD;
your meaning."&#xD;
"Are you a gambler ?" resumed'the Count.&#xD;
"Thank God, I am not !" replied the Mountaineer.&#xD;
"Then how are you so poor at present?" continued the Count.&#xD;
" You should have taken your share of the bargain which brought to&#xD;
your wife an inheritance of three millions."&#xD;
" Three millions !" answered Jean, with a forced laugh.&#xD;
" It is true," resumed the Venetian, " that time and the alehouse&#xD;
Will ruin a man."&#xD;
" You evidently mistake me for some one else," rejoined Jean, with&#xD;
a movement evincing his anger, "and your error almost amounts to&#xD;
an insult, therefore--"&#xD;
"Be not angry quite yet, Jean Claude," calmly interrupted the&#xD;
Count, " I have a long story to tell you."&#xD;
"What name did you mention ?" inquired the Mountaineer.&#xD;
" That of your father !" returned the nobleman.&#xD;
" I never knew I had one," replied the hackman, " I was a found&#xD;
ling."&#xD;
" A foundling!" smilingly resumed the Count, " then you are not&#xD;
the son of dame Marianne of Chambery ?"&#xD;
" I know not who was my mother," answered Jean.&#xD;
" Then," continued the Count in his examinations, "you did not&#xD;
marry in the Church of Saint Martin in the Savoy, Genevieve, adopt-&#xD;
ed daughter of Marianne ?"&#xD;
" Never heard of her," determinately replied the Mountaineer.&#xD;
"Did you not," again resumed the Count, " when Genevieve as-&#xD;
sumed the titles of her ancestors, suffer her to contract a second mar-&#xD;
riage upon conditions still more shameful than the first, by which&#xD;
you agreed to continue as if 'dead and thus make her be believed a&#xD;
widow ?"&#xD;
" Count," responded the Mountaineer in evident anger, "my pa&#xD;
tience is exhausted-finish this examination."&#xD;
"The examination is finished !" said the Italian.&#xD;
" It is very instructive," murmured the mountaineer.&#xD;
"Do you know whence I have just come r" resumed the Count in a&#xD;
threatening manner.&#xD;
" I knew not, neither do I care," returned Jean contemptuously.&#xD;
"From your residence at Passy," answered the Italian.&#xD;
".My residence !" exclaimed the hackman-" the door is locked.'&#xD;
"I caused it to be broken in," resumed the Count.&#xD;
"What ?" rejoined the mountaineer, choking his inquietude beneath&#xD;
an outburst of rage, " that is a burglary."&#xD;

" Make a complaint against me if you dare," responded the count,&#xD;
in a defiant manner. " You have told me you never knew Gene-&#xD;
vieve, once poor, now wealthy-I wish I could believe you. Then&#xD;
how comes it I found this medallion in your possession ?"&#xD;
The Count arose, and going to the Mountaineer, exhibited to him&#xD;
the original souvenir of Genevieve in its pewter locket.&#xD;
"It was given to me by a sister, who died," replied Jean, after a&#xD;
moment's hesitation.&#xD;
" But you were a foundling," sneeringly replied the Italian.&#xD;
" All foundlings are brothers and sisters," returned the coachman.&#xD;
"And Genevieve was likewise a foundling?"&#xD;
" Yes," replied Jean, sullenly.&#xD;
" The tribunal wiil judge of that," quoth the Count, as he noticed&#xD;
a trembling seize upon the frame of the Mountaineer. " And you&#xD;
deny that you are the son of Dame Marianne?"&#xD;
"Most positively," responded Jean.&#xD;
"Then how comes it that I find at. your house this chaplet, which&#xD;
was given to the Dame by a monk of St. Bernard ?"&#xD;
" AIl'chaplets are alike," said Jean, as he recognized the relic.&#xD;
"Not all," rejoined the Italian ; " this one is rather peculiar, as its&#xD;
beads are made of the grey rock, and it hung eighteen years ago in&#xD;
the cottage of Jean Claude, at the base of Mount Cenis."&#xD;
"Whoever told you so, has told you a wilful falsehood," tranquilly&#xD;
responded the Mountaineer.&#xD;
"-No one told me of it--I saw it there." replied the Count.&#xD;
" Then you are, yourself, in error," answered Jean.&#xD;
" Further to convince you," exclaimed the Italian, with a vehe-&#xD;
mence of manner, "I will summon the Countess d'Arezzo, who cannot&#xD;
deny that eighteen years ago, in the month of May, upon the festival&#xD;
of saint Therese, 1 entered to rest myself into the cottage of Jean&#xD;
Claude, and that she herself, then called Genevieve, showed me this&#xD;
selfsame chaplet and told me its history."&#xD;
" You are not the man who rested upon that -day at the house of&#xD;
.the Guide !"&#xD;
" How do you know ?" inquired the Venetian.&#xD;
"That man, who likewise left the valise, was named Luidgi," an-&#xD;
swered Jean.&#xD;
" Who told you so ?" exclaimed the Count.&#xD;
"I have been told so," tranquilly replied the hackman.&#xD;
" Can you prove it?" inquired the nobleman.&#xD;
"Possibly, I can," again answered Jean.&#xD;
" And I can just prove that I am named Andreis Luidgi, Count&#xD;
d'Arezzo !" resumed the Italian, excitedly.&#xD;
" You !" interrupted the Mountaineer, as he gave vent to an excla-&#xD;
mation of exultation: " You are the man !"&#xD;
The Count was inwardly congratulating himself upon having estab-&#xD;
-lished the identity of Jean Claude, when the servant, opening the door,&#xD;
announced Colonel Henri Roger.   '&#xD;

THE' TABLES TURNED.&#xD;
" You desire to speak to me ?" inquired Colonel Roger, as he enter&#xD;
ed the apartment.,&#xD;
" Yes Colonel," replied the Count.&#xD;
" I deem it my duty to give you warning," commenced the Colo&#xD;
nel, " that I refuse in advance every amicable arrangement you may&#xD;
proffer ; and now be brief-what have you to say ?"&#xD;
" I desire to counsel you to renounce all idea of this marriage," re-&#xD;
turned the Count.&#xD;
"tWherefore ?" in turn inquired the Colonel-" for what reason?"&#xD;
"Suffer me to refuse all explanation," rejoined the Italian.&#xD;
"Still, Count-" urged the young soldier.&#xD;
" It will be for your interest," returned the Count.&#xD;
"It appears to me," continued the Colonel, " I have a right to re&#xD;
quire-to insist-"&#xD;
" A right !" exclaimed the Venetian.&#xD;
"Yes, sir," deliberately retorted Henri, " the right-----"&#xD;
"Well, sir, permit me merely to give you advice," resumed the&#xD;
Count, with renewed gravity. " People don't generally marry the&#xD;
daughter of a woman, to be tried before criminal courts."&#xD;
" What do you mean ?" inquired the Colonel testily.&#xD;
" Simply that the Countess is a'bigamist," replied the Venetian.&#xD;
" Bigamist !" exclaimed the Colonel.&#xD;
" That man," quoth the Italian, designating Jean, " who is disguised&#xD;
beneath the name of the Mountaineer   -"&#xD;
"That is Jean the hacknan." returned the Colonel.&#xD;
" That is," continued the Count emphatically, " Jean Claude Thi&#xD;
baut, the Countess' first husband, whom she deefares to be dead."&#xD;
" Wait a moment," quoth Jean with animation as he passedin front&#xD;
of the Colonel; " your pardon, sir. The Count is seeking after Jean&#xD;
Claude Thibaut, native of Saint Genis, an Alpine Guide, who lived&#xD;
near Saint Martin-yes ; I knew him well-he was slain upon the&#xD;
Mountain."&#xD;
"Along with my father !" interrupted the Colonel with a sigh.&#xD;
" Who was betrayed," resumed Jean, " by a Venetian, who, on the&#xD;
day of Saint Therese, concealed himself, within the cottage of the&#xD;
Guide." Then addressing the Count -he continued : " Oh, I could&#xD;
talk to you of that story. Poor Jean Claude died in my arms, Count,&#xD;
saying that the traitor, whose none he had on his valise, was named&#xD;
Luidgi."&#xD;
&#xD;

" Impudent wretch ?" muttered the Count to himself.&#xD;
"And the general Bonaparte," continued Jean Claude, to the Colo-&#xD;
nel, " although then a poor man, offered a handful of gold to whoever&#xD;
would discover the family of Luidgi. Now I am  sure that to find&#xD;
out the betrayer of his companion-in-arms the Emperor Napoleon&#xD;
would give more that twenty conquered standards-still we have&#xD;
never been able to discover the family name of this accused Venetian,&#xD;
and you, Count; have never heard mention made of this assassin,&#xD;
you who were born at Venice ?"&#xD;
"I," said the Count, in trepidation, "I was born at Florence."&#xD;
" During eighteen years," musiugly quoth the Oolonel, " this mur-&#xD;
derer of my father has doubtlessly died."&#xD;
" We can't say," resumed Jean, his eyes fixed intently upon&#xD;
d'Arezzo, "ferocious animals live longer than others, and you&#xD;
have believed, Count, that I am Jean Thibaut, because I am named&#xD;
Jean and because I am  a child of the Mountains. Reassure your-&#xD;
self, and to be convinced of your error, hold, here are the records of&#xD;
service of Jean the Mountaineer. Examine them, read them, there&#xD;
are only wanting the records of my birth and baptism. The first,&#xD;
my father forgot to put in the basket with me, and as to the second&#xD;
my companions christened me the Mountaineer. As for Jean Thibaut&#xD;
-a wicked idea of your own, devised to torment the Countess, it&#xD;
may some day bring misfortune on your own head. Sooner or later,&#xD;
as you well know, evil actions are punished and the older we grow,&#xD;
the more convinced we must be of all the justice of Heaven. Fare-&#xD;
well, Colonel."&#xD;
"Arc you going ?" inquired the young soldier.&#xD;
.Yes, but it will not be long before we meet again, replied," Jean ,&#xD;
then turning to the Count he continued: "1 will return to demand&#xD;
the. papers of Jean, the foundling, surnamed the Mountaineer. To a&#xD;
speedy meeting !"&#xD;
He is gone;, murmured the Count, as he heard the doors close&#xD;
after the exited Mountaineer ; then taking up the documents, which&#xD;
had been 1 brown upon the table by the veteran, lie made a semblance&#xD;
of examining them.&#xD;
'[hat man was-right," resumed the Colonel, "particularly when&#xD;
he charged you with inventing tortures for your wife. And by what&#xD;
odious suspicious do you not se ek to wound, to injure her, and above&#xD;
all to break off my marriage, which you dread so deeply ? Still in&#xD;
spite of your obstinacy, the motive for which is revealed, that mar-&#xD;
riage will tale place without your consent and within the shortest&#xD;
space of time possible. For I have hastened to recall to you that no&#xD;
tie of blood connects you with Mademoiselle Jane, and to prove to.&#xD;
you that the Countess will find in me a son, who will know how to&#xD;
protect and defend her. Upon that head I pledge- my solemn oath.&#xD;
I have solicited peace from you, sir ; now I desire war."&#xD;
With a look of mingled defiance and contempt the young soldier&#xD;
stalked majest ally out of the room, leaving the noble criminal to,&#xD;
his own reflections.&#xD;

" War !" shouted the Count, tossing the documents, which he held&#xD;
in his hand, disdainfully on the table. "Yes ! I could vanquish you&#xD;
all, were it not for this terrible fatality which ever pursues me. This&#xD;
man, this Thibaut possesses a terrible secret-but will he be believ-&#xD;
ed ?  Yes, old soldiers are ever listened to in France. How can I&#xD;
deliver myself from him?  He has my secret, but that of the Coun-&#xD;
tess. To avoid compromising Genevieve he will, doubtlessly, fly&#xD;
far from hence. He can be disposed of, how to get rid of the Col-&#xD;
onel and the Countess ?"&#xD;
The Count mused sullenly and was awakened from his revery by&#xD;
the sudden entrance of a man through the window of the parlor.&#xD;
" Who is these? exclaimed the Count in affright.&#xD;
"6th Dragoons," responded the Mountaineer, "in the enemy's&#xD;
camp!"&#xD;
"You commit burglary ?" shouted the Italian, ferociously-&#xD;
" You broke open my door," responded Jean, energetically, "and I&#xD;
have opened your window. A friend whom I encountered in the-&#xD;
court-yard made himself into a short ladder and I have taken a short&#xD;
cut into the room."                                  /&#xD;
"Sir," added the enraged Count., "you are quite venturesome."&#xD;
"Oh ! don't get angry yet awhile," responded the veteran in a calm&#xD;
collected manner; "I've a long story to tell you, but, first, the&#xD;
chaplet of my mother-"&#xD;
" Is it this which you want ?" quoth the Count handing him the rel-&#xD;
ic ; "now ydu avow yourself the child of Marianne Thibaut ?"&#xD;
" The child of Marianne," replied Jean, gravely, " has come to&#xD;
avenge Genevieve .'"&#xD;
"Or perchance to ruin her, " retorted the Venetian.&#xD;
"Not as yet, Luidgi !" replied Jean.&#xD;
"I am not the Luidgi, to whom you allude," rejoined the Vene-&#xD;
tian.&#xD;
" It is too late to deny it," reasserted the Mountaineer.&#xD;
"What proofs have you of my being the person ?" inquired the&#xD;
Count.&#xD;
" In the first place I will prove it," answered the veteran, " be-&#xD;
cause being determined upon the death of the Guide, you caused the&#xD;
General to be massacred : you were interested in the death of Jean&#xD;
Claude."&#xD;
"I !" ejaculated the Count, " for what purpose ?"&#xD;
"To enrich Genevieve and then to rob her," returned Jean.&#xD;
"To rob her !" muttered the Italian.&#xD;
"I have not time to pick out my words," resumed the veteran.&#xD;
" I have said it and 1 mean it; and perchance I will prove it before&#xD;
long that you went masked to throw a young female into the Seine."&#xD;
" Can you suppose-?" interrupted the Count.&#xD;
"Yes," rejoined the mountaineer undauntedly, " still I dare not&#xD;
complain of it, for, by means of this crime, I have been enabled to&#xD;
save my daughter's life, and to find out my Genevieve ; I could, if I&#xD;
would, in return conceal myself to waylay you; but when a man has&#xD;
&#xD;
KE&#xD;
&#xD;
served a dozen years beneath the banner of France, he does no such&#xD;
things. We attack our enemies, face to face, and summon them to&#xD;
combat loyality in a duel,-wrong, perhaps still it is the custom.&#xD;
Now that is the reason I have hurried here to ask of you in two words&#xD;
--th'e hour and place of meeting."&#xD;
"Your passion," interrupted the Count, " your insolence and anger&#xD;
seems to have prevented your thought of the distances-&#xD;
" Excuse me," responded Jean, " 1 know you to be a rascal, while&#xD;
I am an honest man, and I throw the distance in as a bargain for the&#xD;
difference--"&#xD;
" There are unfortunately," replied the Venetion, " limits, which&#xD;
the laws of nobility do not permit a man to trauscede-I am the&#xD;
Count d'Arezzo, chevalier of St. Mary-"&#xD;
" And I am of the Legion of honor," remarked the Veterarn&#xD;
proudly, " and I will wager I have had more trouble to gain my&#xD;
cross than you had for yours--But we will not speak of that."&#xD;
Nevertheless," interposed the Italian.&#xD;
" You are a Count and chevalier, say you ?" quoth Jean, " you are&#xD;
a coward-"&#xD;
Sir !" exclaimed the Count, indignantly.&#xD;
" You are a wretch, and have been so for more than twelve years,"&#xD;
continued the Mountaineer, in a sonorous tone of voice.  " You&#xD;
have robbed, harassed, tortured during that period, two defenceless&#xD;
women, an when the father and the husband comes to challenge the&#xD;
assassin of his family, you speak of distance. Ohl have a care.&#xD;
Luidgi, that the old soldier may not for an instant, forget the dictates&#xD;
of honor. Now let us ,determine the hour for the meetings, let me&#xD;
counsel you."&#xD;
" Should I accer t your challenge," responded the nobleman, i' who&#xD;
would be your second ?"&#xD;
"= It is a matter of no consequence," returned the veteran.&#xD;
"Mine would desire -to know," resumed the Count.&#xD;
" My second will be Petit Pierre," replied Jean, "a friend of my&#xD;
Childhood, devoted-to me as a brother."&#xD;
I will not be able to find a single one of my friends," resumed&#xD;
d'Arezzo, promenading the room, unconcernedly, " who would consent&#xD;
to regulate the conditions of a duel with Petit Pierre, and that&#xD;
renders a duel impossible."&#xD;
" Is that the case ?" rejoined the veteran, with a smile, " well, we&#xD;
will arrange it in a different manner. I will seek my old commander&#xD;
at the Battle of Arcola, who was an intimate friend of General&#xD;
Roger and of Massena and who, at the present time, is Marshal of&#xD;
France. Prince d'Essling and Duke of Rivoli-who ran over the&#xD;
ground swearing that he would shoot Luidgi in the evening were I to&#xD;
miss him in the morning. And if your friend finds the Marshal too&#xD;
small a man, I know of no one higher, unless it be the Pope or the&#xD;
Emperor. But the Pope forbids duelling and the Emperor they say,&#xD;
has no time to attend to it.  Come," exclaimed the veteran, observ-&#xD;
ing the uneasiness of the Count at his suggestion, " you prefer, I' see,&#xD;

Petit Pierre to the Marshal-I go then for Pierre, and we will have&#xD;
no further words. Now, the place of meeting ?"&#xD;
The Count after a moments reflection designated the Bois de&#xD;
Vincennes.&#xD;
"The Bois de Vincennes!" ejaculated Jean, "it is a large place."'&#xD;
"Porte St. Maude," said the Italian, "at the guard house."&#xD;
"Very well," returned the veteran, " now the hour'?"&#xD;
"The'break of day," replied the nobleman.&#xD;
"1All agreed upon," quoth the Mountaineer, "but not without&#xD;
somd trouble,"&#xD;
" I will be punctual, Monsieur Jean," responded the Count, " and&#xD;
I trust to chastise you for your msolence."&#xD;
" All in good time," answered Jean, " you will have need of your&#xD;
courage as well as your bill."&#xD;
Then as he was about emerging through the door, the veteran&#xD;
turned and addressed the Count: "To-morrow, Luidgi, and to the&#xD;
death !"&#xD;
CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
THE PORTE ST. MAUDE.&#xD;
TOWARDS the break of day, Morel, the. bonfidential friend of the&#xD;
Count d'Arezzo, proinenaded in front of the guard-house,-at the Porte&#xD;
St. Maude in the Bois de Vincennes. The gentleman was strangely&#xD;
transformed in personal appearance, for instead of his usual costume&#xD;
he wore the full uniform of a forest guard. le amused himself, while&#xD;
walking about to resist the chill ot the morning, imagining by what&#xD;
means the Count had obtained the consent of the ordinary guardian&#xD;
to prmmnit him to stand about in borrowed plumage, but finally con-&#xD;
ciilMil that fair promises as well as good pay had wrought the miracle.&#xD;
Here I am, under aurs," soliloquized the Florentine, " but I cail-&#xD;
not divie what can he the intentions of the Count, whom I blindly&#xD;
serv-etill I trust that it will lead to the payment of my five hun.&#xD;
dred ad twelve thousand francs. The Count told me to await here&#xD;
the e:rriv;al of the coacimnr, and then warn him,1as I would meet hin&#xD;
i the grand avenue.  W ly the Count has thought proper to get rid&#xD;
f the guard, I cao't Sa ,bu  the mystery will soon be expbaied. I&#xD;
h t ethis Jean won't discover me-here comes some oine-it is him."&#xD;
Is this ihe road to the guard-house upon the road to St. Maude ?"&#xD;
inquired Jean the Mountaineer, as he entered, bearing a pair of pistols&#xD;
i .his hands.&#xD;
"This is the place," answered the counterfeit guard.  " you are&#xD;
travelling early in the wood ?"&#xD;
j   arl so m ei' 1oe icn, absorbed in other thoughts.&#xD;
" I miut iake my round," resumi. d MIrel, " this is a good tine to&#xD;

&#xD;
You will find some not far ofi," returned Jean, " I heard some one&#xD;
treading upon the grass near the grand avenue."&#xD;
I will go see," replied the false forester, " it must be the Count."&#xD;
Jean walked about in meditation, awaiting the arrival of Pierre, as&#xD;
he had started before tiat individual in order to have time to say a&#xD;
prayer while on his way. The worthy Savoyard did not, however,&#xD;
hep hini long waiting, for, deemimg the presence of a carriage an act&#xD;
 of precaution, he drove up the green hack, and shielding it from ob-&#xD;
servation among the dense underwood of the fores', hurried to the&#xD;
guard-house.to enter upon his duties as a second. Pierre was a prac-&#xD;
Ieol phlosopher ; a earrig :was a necessary to a duel, serving as a&#xD;
hearse for the deceased, or the means of escape for the survivor.&#xD;
"I was cert;n you vWould 'ot be behind time," quoth Pierre, enter-&#xD;
lug upon the ground in front of the guard house " you are alone."&#xD;
"Yu see Iam waiting ori this Luidgi," replied the veteran.&#xD;
"[he will be always too soon," remarked the Savoyard.&#xD;
Why so " inquired the Motntaineer.&#xD;
Because," said his companion, " it should be forbidden that a brave&#xD;
man, like you, should risk his life against that of a felon, like him."&#xD;
How otherwise," calmly remarked the veteran, ' can I disincum-&#xD;
ber the world of hin, unless through a duel ?"&#xD;
Bah !"'quoth Pierre with a significant expression of disdain, " let&#xD;
inc do it,-with my stout cudgel."&#xD;
" Be perfectly easy," returned the Mountaineer, " I have my mo.&#xD;
thenrs ehaplet with me, and I have prayed to the God of the Brave.&#xD;
However, Pierre, we should anticipate all accident : should my des-&#xD;
tiny deterinmate that a ball should open my road to my last home,&#xD;
you will go, Pierre, to Colonel Roger, and declare to him that the&#xD;
Count caused his father to be shot, and you will join him in watching'&#xD;
over my Jane."&#xD;
'here is no need in telling me that," responded the Savoyard&#xD;
aloud, who iurmnurel inaudibly: "If he only knew that I have told&#xD;
the Colonel ail about it."      r&#xD;
,V bhieh of you is named Pierre ?" inquired  Morel, returning&#xD;
from his walk.&#xD;
TnatLs me," replied the Savoyaid, " what's wanting I"&#xD;
A gendiemami, w) o ias just arrived on horseback," replied the&#xD;
false guardian, ' charged Inc to announee to you that as second to the&#xD;
adversary of your friend, he is at your service."&#xD;
-- W hore is he i" inquired Pierre.&#xD;
" I will conduct you to hiu," said Morel, trembling for fearof being&#xD;
detected.&#xD;
. I n vith you," replied Pierre, taking up the pistol with repug.&#xD;
nance.&#xD;
" Pierre, you know the rules," calmly said Jean, '" fifteen paces amid&#xD;
fire until one&#xD;
" All right," responded Pierre, following Morel to the grand avenue.&#xD;
One hour hence," soliloquized the veteran, " and the hazard of the&#xD;
lie will be decided ; sold unisfirtune arrive, Pierre and the Colonef&#xD;

who survive me, will be protectors to my wife and child." And Jean&#xD;
paced the ground resignedly.&#xD;
" The Guard House," whispered the Countess to Jane, as the two&#xD;
ladies made their appearance from the opposite side of the domicile&#xD;
of the forest ranger.&#xD;
"This must be it," responded Jane, when seeing Jean, she pointed&#xD;
him out to her mother who immediately advanced towards the impa-&#xD;
tient veteran.&#xD;
" Genevieve !" exclaimed the mountaineer, in astonishment.&#xD;
" Genevieve !" returned the Countess, in a voice of unaffected en-&#xD;
dearment, " has heard of your appointment to fight the Count d'Ar-&#xD;
tzzo, and has hurried to prevent the combat."&#xD;
But, Madam," replied Jean, inflexibly, "a man has sacred duties,&#xD;
which he must perform."&#xD;
- " The most sacred of duties," resumed the lady, "is that which&#xD;
preserves those dear to us, and at the hour of duelling I come armed&#xD;
with your daughter."&#xD;
"You have then entrusted Mademoiselle Jane," quoth the veteran,&#xD;
moved at this exhibition of affection.&#xD;
"Everything," interrupted the beautiful girl, "oh, father ! I had no&#xD;
need of this to love you, but now I have the right of informing you&#xD;
that you are no longer your own property, and therefore' cannot ex-'&#xD;
pose days which belong to the ch:ld, who entreats you to preserve her&#xD;
wealth."&#xD;
"My daughter !" exclaimed Jean, in sincerity of affection.&#xD;
" Only think," continued the maiden, her tones augmenting in affec-&#xD;
tionate interest, "that my mother taught me in my earliest infancy to&#xD;
pray God for you, father, and now, after having suffered so much from&#xD;
the disdain of the man usurping your name, I find you-the object of&#xD;
my early prayers and after sorrows, on the eve of a duel I But you&#xD;
will not fight, father, for 1 have need for you to live, that I may love&#xD;
and cherish you."&#xD;
"1My Jane !" exclaimed the Mountaineer despondingly, " you will&#xD;
renderine a coward and poltroon--1 likewish at this moment contemn&#xD;
the duel ; I too dread death, when my daughter stands before me, a&#xD;
treasury of kindness and affection."&#xD;
"W hat can we do to prevent this duel ?" interposed the Countess.&#xD;
" \ie can do nothing, my poor woman," responded Jean. "I must&#xD;
see Pierre, who is at this moment engaged in arranging the conditions&#xD;
of the combat."&#xD;
" W here is he !" inquired the Countess,&#xD;
Not far hence," replied the veteran. " I will go join him, and he&#xD;
may be able to assist us."&#xD;
Jean walked leisurely in the direction in which Pierre had disap-&#xD;
peared, when he perceived the Count coming towards him and invol-&#xD;
untarily announced the fact.&#xD;
" He here !" exclaimed the Countess, " we will remain with you."&#xD;
" No," replied Jean sternly, " he might insult one of you."&#xD;
"1Then the duel will be inevitable," interrupted Jane.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ALPINE      GUIDE.                  81&#xD;
"If we could only hide ourselves," quoth the Countess.&#xD;
"Where l" responded the veteran, going to the guard-house,"this&#xD;
door is closed-no ! it opens- enter here."&#xD;
" Yes !" replied the Countess, taking her daughter with her by her&#xD;
arm; then, standing upon the threshold, she entreated Jean to pledge&#xD;
his word to abstain from the combat.&#xD;
" I swear to adjourn the duel if within my power," responded Jean,&#xD;
as the ladies concealed themselves in the house ; "no ! I cannot fight&#xD;
at this moment, my eyes are filled with tears and my hand trembles."&#xD;
" Morel has doubtlessly given Pierre the wrong direction," quot&#xD;
the Count as he entered. "Some time must elapse ere he can find&#xD;
his way again."&#xD;
" A h, 'tis you, Count ?" said the Mountaineer, accosting him.&#xD;
"-Before taking our positions," commenced the Italian, "I have some.&#xD;
thing to say to you particularly."&#xD;
And I also desire to speak to you," responded Jean.&#xD;
"You !" exclaimed the Count in surprise, " proceed, I listen."&#xD;
" I believe," said Jean, with embarrassment, " that each one of us&#xD;
-upon sober thought, might---that is-instead of the duel-for the&#xD;
duel-"&#xD;
" Well?-' interrupted the Count.&#xD;
" We will," stammered out the veteran," leave the matter entirely&#xD;
to chance."&#xD;
"1 did not expect to find you with such ideas," responded the&#xD;
Italian, although distrustful of the man's sincerity, "and if they are&#xD;
really your own, you can annul the combat---"&#xD;
Upon what conditions ?" interrupted the Mountaineer.&#xD;
" Upon condition," replied the Count, " that on the morrow you&#xD;
depart for America with your daughter Jane--"&#xD;
"But she loves the Colonel," interposed Jean&#xD;
" You will teach her to forget him," replied tie Venetian.&#xD;
"And -her mother ?" inquired the veteran, " what will become of&#xD;
her, deprived of her exiled child ? no-no-it is impossible "&#xD;
"Impossible, do you say ?" quoth the Count, sarcastically.11 "Prob-&#xD;
ably you are not aware that 1 can rid myself of you, who have fallen&#xD;
into this trap.&#xD;
" Trap !" ejaculated Jean in amazement.&#xD;
" Here I could slay you without the presence of a witness" said&#xD;
the Count, drawing a pistol from his bosom, and presenting it full&#xD;
cocked at the mountaineer, who folded his arms, and prepared to meet&#xD;
his death with the courage of a soldier.      Pe         m&#xD;

CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
MARENGO's LAST JOB.&#xD;
" You are deceived !" exclaimed the Corrtess, suddenly appearing&#xD;
from the guard-house, followed by J ane.&#xD;
"The Countess !" exclaimed the astonished culprit.&#xD;
" Have a care, mother !" implored Jane, as she interposed her per-&#xD;
son between the Count and her parent.&#xD;
"Away, my daughter !" quoth the Countess, tenderly repelling&#xD;
her, as she continued excitedly, " the Count is your heir, but at my&#xD;
death he loses everything, and therefore I can brave hin. I can, and&#xD;
no blood will be spilled-no duel-I will summon him before the&#xD;
law which will decide my destiny."&#xD;
" Genevieve !" exclaimed Jean, somewhat terrified.&#xD;
"The law !" muttered the Italian, sarcastically.&#xD;
" I desire," continued the lady, elevating her voice in passion, "to&#xD;
appear before the Court with my two husbands,-he who succored&#xD;
me in indigence, and he who tortured me in wealth. I wish them to&#xD;
krow that my daughter belongs to the poor man she honors, and not&#xD;
to the rich man she despises. In a word I wish to be tried. The&#xD;
world, absolving me in advance, will learn that which nmy family has&#xD;
forgotten-that.true nobility belongs to the heart."&#xD;
" You are ignorant, madame," interposed the Count, smilingly,&#xD;
" that a judgment will come to you with dishonor."&#xD;
"Dishonor !" ejaculated the lady, " I 'can be dishonored no more&#xD;
than by the name I bear. I defy you and put my trust in God."&#xD;
"I accept the struggle as I hurl back defiance," wildly responded&#xD;
the Count. " There are men whom difficulties overwhelm, but there&#xD;
are others who can break them down like rushes. Destruction to you&#xD;
all, and may you fall into the abyss you have toiled 'to dig for my&#xD;
feet !"&#xD;
Humiliated, frenzied, and infuriated, the Count d'Arezzo took his&#xD;
departure. casting glances of defiance upon the family who had ex-&#xD;
pelled the caitiff from its bosom.&#xD;
"1Thanks, Genevieve," murmured the Alpine Guide, as the tears of&#xD;
gratitude rolled from his eyes, " who would offer yourself for sacrifice&#xD;
in my place. Still you know not the new danger which threatens&#xD;
you--"&#xD;
" A new danger !" ejaculated the lady.&#xD;
" You knpw, poor woman," resumed the Mountaineer, Ifthat they&#xD;
ever condemn good souls--you are perchance right in placing your&#xD;
trust in the justice of man-unfortunately they can neither condemn&#xD;
or absolve you."&#xD;
&#xD;
c2o&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
Why ?" inquired the Countess.&#xD;
" Because," replied Jean, " the Count can never be your accuser,&#xD;
and will remain more than ever your enemy."&#xD;
"And will you not defend my mother ?" pathetically inquired Jane.&#xD;
" Reassure yourself," returned the Mountaineer, "I undertake the&#xD;
defence of your mother, and when I perish with that assassin--...."&#xD;
"Perish, my father !" exclaimed the maiden.&#xD;
"YWould I not deem myself guilty of all the evil that malefactor&#xD;
has created for you, and will continue to create, unless I follow .his&#xD;
guilty footsteps," acnd thus speaking wildly, the Alpine Guide started&#xD;
to follow in the wake of the Count.&#xD;
" Jean,! father !" entreatingly exclaimed the sorrow-stricken ladies&#xD;
endeavoring to restrain his departure.&#xD;
" What is that ?" exclaimed the Mountaineer, as the report of a&#xD;
couple of pistol shots followed each other in rapid succession.&#xD;
"Some one comes from the grand avenue," exclaimed Jane.&#xD;
"It is Henri !"&#xD;
" What has happened ?" said Jean, musingly ; and then addressing&#xD;
the Colonel, who was accompanied by the ever faithfulPetit Pierre;&#xD;
what is it, Colonel ?"&#xD;
"The Count d'Arezzo," quoth the soldier.&#xD;
"Well!" interrupted the Mountaineer, nervously.&#xD;
"Thanks to the revelations of Pierre," replied the Colonel.&#xD;
" I have forced the assassin of General Roger to fight."&#xD;
" The assassin of the General !" exclaimed the Countess.&#xD;
" Yes, Madame," rejoined her future son-in-law, " and Jean Claude&#xD;
Thibaut can prove to you that I had a father to avenge."&#xD;
"And now, 1Genevieve," interposed the Savoyard, joyfully," the&#xD;
child can go home with Jean Claude, and I have exactly No. 226 on&#xD;
the field and I'm a going to drive."&#xD;
"What !" exclaimed Jean deliriously, " I ride in my own -carriage&#xD;
with Genevieve, and the child of Jean Claude; it is a dream, let us&#xD;
start before it disappears--come, friends, come."&#xD;
As he spoke the green cab, withi Pierre on the box drove up to&#xD;
them, and the worthy Savoyard soon forced the party to take their&#xD;
seats within it. Snapping his whip with the most approved science of&#xD;
a coachman, Pierre drove off in triumph as Jean exclaimed to his&#xD;
sanguine companions:                                         s&#xD;
"Courage, Marengo, old fellow ! it is your last job!"&#xD;
That night the Emperor pardoned a duel, and sanctioned a marriage.&#xD;

THE ALPINE GUIDE.&#xD;
THE WITCH.&#xD;
&#xD;
IZEKIAH Noarms was one of those who in the latter part of the&#xD;
17th century, emigrated from England to this country for the purpose&#xD;
of enjoying, in peace and without molestation, those religious privi-,&#xD;
leges which at home were prohibited, under the most severe penalties.&#xD;
He was one of that class of plain religionists denominated Puritans,&#xD;
who considered that the surplices and vestments used by the clergy&#xD;
of the episcopal church, were an abomination in the sight of the Lord,&#xD;
and he looked upon the beautiful ceremonials of that church as being&#xD;
but very little removed from the gross abuses that had crept into and&#xD;
almost swallowed up the imposing ceremonials and strict ritual observ-&#xD;
ances of her elder sister of Rome.&#xD;
Whether the opposition of the Puritans to the established church&#xD;
was right or wrong, I must leave to the decision of wiser heads than&#xD;
mine; but I-ezekiah Norris held the opinion of many stout and stern&#xD;
hearts of the same period, that he and they did perfectly right in&#xD;
opposing it, and all that belonged to it, to the utmost exent of his&#xD;
and their ability.&#xD;
His wife, as in duty bound, held the same opinion, and when they&#xD;
had received some gentle hints ~from the authorities of the place in&#xD;
which they resided, that from their obstinacy in religious matters,&#xD;
their small property was in danger of sequestration, Hezekiah very&#xD;
wisely resolved to sell it, square accounts with the world, put trust in&#xD;
Providence, and with his wife and two small children, emigrate across&#xD;
the Atlantic.&#xD;
 " By the blessing of God," as our friend Hezekiah expressed it, they&#xD;
had a pleasant passage, and all arrived safe at Plymouth on the 16th&#xD;
of the following July.&#xD;
This goodly place not suiting the fancy of our worthy pilgrim, in&#xD;
the spring of the next year he removed to Salem, where with his&#xD;
family he soon became permanently located. With the proceeds of&#xD;
the sale of his former property, he soon built him a snug little house,&#xD;
near the spot where now stands the large brick edifice known as the&#xD;
Franklin Building. He also possessed a little garden in which his&#xD;
wife, assisted by the little Anna, their daughter, cultivated some&#xD;
flowers which they had transplanted from their former little garden&#xD;
in "merrie England."  And careful, very careful were they con-&#xD;
strained to be in this harmless occupation, for the red sous of the&#xD;
forest, become jealous of the encroaching whites, were at that&#xD;
period making sudden irruptions upon families, and in many instances&#xD;
whole villages fell a prey to their cunning and savage warfare, thus&#xD;
rendering necessary the greatest caution it carrying on even the&#xD;
most common avocations of life. But a few days prior to the open-&#xD;
ing of our story, two men, while at work in the fields, had been shot&#xD;
at and killed by an unseen foe, and several other indications of a&#xD;
warlike nature having been shown by the Red Men, rendered it neces-&#xD;
sary for the settlers to be ever vigilant and always upon their guard,&#xD;
Therefore, every one kept their fire-arms within their reach, and&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
*       ,&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
It&#xD;
&#xD;
seldom was it a family retired to rest, during that dark period in the&#xD;
history of our venerable town, without having a sentinel of some kind.&#xD;
to watch for the appearance of their savage and implacable foes.&#xD;
In the night that our story opens, Hezekiah, having just returned&#xD;
from the labors of the field, entered the door of his humble dwelling,&#xD;
and having deposited his loaded rifle safely in its place, called out,&#xD;
BCome, wife, my dear, supper, supper."&#xD;
But his wife did not answer him, she being at the same time en-&#xD;
gaged in the garden with little Anna and the flowers.&#xD;
lezekiali soon found them out and joined them, reminding them at&#xD;
the same time that the hour for supper and evening devotion was&#xD;
at hand. Upon hearing this, they left their pleasing employment,&#xD;
and joining Hezekiah, proceeded to the house. The evening being&#xD;
warm and sultry, the doors and windows were thrown open, whilst&#xD;
(after a blessing had been craved) this little family eat in religious&#xD;
silence their evening meal. After it was finished, "little John," the&#xD;
brother and son, having just returned from a neighbor's took down&#xD;
the large family Bible, and placing it upon his father's knee, the old&#xD;
man opened it, and read a portion of it aloud, at the commencement&#xD;
of evening worship. This done, they all rose, then dropping upon&#xD;
their knees, he poured forth a simple, devout, and fervent prayer.&#xD;
.At its conclusion, as he arose from his knees, he was surprised to&#xD;
find that an unlooked-for and unknown visitor had been in attendance&#xD;
during part, if not the whole of his short supplication.&#xD;
He was soon aware that his visitor was a woman of tall and stately&#xD;
form, dressed after the manner of the Indian women of that period,&#xD;
and that she bore in her arms a beautiful babe, delicate and fair as&#xD;
the whitest rose. The woman spoke-&#xD;
"Man of the pale face and strong arm! Nature, the spirit of the&#xD;
clouds -commands me to confide this child to your protection and care&#xD;
-take her; let her be brought up as your daughter ; and mind! as&#xD;
you dread an lndian's vengeance, that no harm ever befals her. At&#xD;
the end of every yeay, come to the cavern that you wot of by the&#xD;
side of the Indian Oak, and you will find money sufficient for all her&#xD;
expenses. Answer me not, but take her, and remember that you&#xD;
have once seen her of whom you have often heard-aye, even Zoraida,&#xD;
the Witch of Naumkeag.'&#xD;
So saying, she stepped forward, and depositing her burden in the&#xD;
lap of lJrs. Norris, with a proud and stately step, she left the house,&#xD;
and ere the astonished inmates could muster presence of mind enough&#xD;
to follow her, she had turned into the woods, and speedily vanished&#xD;
from their sight.&#xD;
We must now take the privilege assumed by all the romancers, and&#xD;
transport the attention of the reader to the mansion of an English&#xD;
nobleman, situated in London. In the drawing-room of this mansion,&#xD;
about two years previous to the time mentioned in our last chapter;&#xD;
might have been seen, sitting at a small round table, sipping his&#xD;
chocolate late in the morning, the Right Honorable Lord Henry Fitz-&#xD;
sinuinous. He was dressed in a loose morning-gown, and the appear-&#xD;

ance of a bandage round his head, together with the redness of his&#xD;
eyes, gave pretty strong tokens of an overnight debauch.&#xD;
" I have a great mind," said this- Right Honorable Lord, soliloqui-&#xD;
zing : " to leave off drinking this cursed wine, it makes one have such&#xD;
confounded headaches. Good Heavens ! how my temples throb now,&#xD;
in spite of Camphor, Eau de Cologne, and all other such remedies-&#xD;
past 11 o'clock," exclaimed he, looking at his gold repeater, "I shall&#xD;
not be able to take my seat in the House of Peers to-day," so say-&#xD;
ing; he remained silent till a servant entering, announced that Lord&#xD;
George Herbert was below.&#xD;
" Show him up," said his master, and the servant departing, soon&#xD;
returned, and ushered in Lord George, whose countenance,.like that&#xD;
of his Right Honorable companion, bore visible marks of recent dis-&#xD;
sipation and excess.&#xD;
" Good morning, Lord Herbert," exclaimed Fitzsimmons, as soon&#xD;
as his companion had seated himself, "how does your lordship feel&#xD;
this morning ?"&#xD;
"Indifferently well," replied Lord George, "as regards bodily&#xD;
health, but a strange circumstance has recently occurred, which bids&#xD;
fair for the future to seriously endanger the health of my mind."&#xD;
"And what lamentable accident, if I may take the liberty to ask,"&#xD;
said Fitzsimmons, "has taken place to impair the strength of that&#xD;
hitherto-considered impregnable fortress of thy bosom ?"&#xD;
" Indeed," replied Lord George, more seriously than before, " I am&#xD;
scarcely prepared to answer that question ; but this much I will in-&#xD;
form you, that after the party at Lord A -  's last evening had&#xD;
broken up, I returned home as you well know, much excited by wine,&#xD;
and entered my wife's chamber. Judge of my surprise at finding it&#xD;
untenanted. I immediately called together all the servants, but all&#xD;
the information I could gain of them concerning her, was that she had&#xD;
walked out in the early part of the evening aid had not since re-&#xD;
turned. It was late-I knew not what to think, or how to act. In&#xD;
turning to look towards the bed, I discerned a note lying upon it-in&#xD;
a moment I had opened it, and read as follows :-&#xD;
' " LORD GEORGE HERBERT:&#xD;
" 'False deceiver, farewell-I leave you now forever. Thinkest-&#xD;
thou that the heart of woman, weak and tender though it may be, can&#xD;
have ,the sharp-pointed dagger of jealousy pierce to its very core, and&#xD;
not feel it ? Thinkest that thy criminal flirtations with that wretched&#xD;
hag the Countess of A---e have been witnessed by me unheeded ?&#xD;
Satisfied as I am from I what I have seen and heard, aye, seen, that&#xD;
you have proved recreant to all ties of honor and true love, I have&#xD;
resolved never more to see you. Live and be happy if thou cast&#xD;
with thy paramour, but never shall it be said that the proud daughter&#xD;
of Duncan of Scotland brooked such deadly insults, even from the&#xD;
partner of her bosom. But oh, Herbert, though almost turned to&#xD;
stone by the mortal injuries, my lacerated heart still clings to thee,&#xD;
when 1 reflect that ere long I shall become the miserable mother ot'&#xD;

your child, and if-but oh, no, it cannot be, between us there is fixed&#xD;
an impassable gulf.&#xD;
"'I shall embark as soon as possible for America, but-if you have&#xD;
any regard for your own life or that of your child, seek not to foflow&#xD;
me.&#xD;
" 'Thus writes for the last time the much injured&#xD;
"'EMILY HERBERT'"&#xD;
".Ods blood," exclaimed Fitzsimmons, as his friend finished reading&#xD;
this epistle, "what a woman, high spirited as a young lioness, methinks&#xD;
if she had been my wife I could have loved her for that attribute alone.&#xD;
Why could you not love her ?"&#xD;
Why;' replied Lord George, " I did love her as I could, but there&#xD;
was a certain something, in her manner and temperament, a- boldness&#xD;
that I could hold no sympathy with. Young and gay, with the repu-&#xD;
tation of Eing handsome, I courted pleasure and congenial spirits.&#xD;
On the other hand she lived mostly in an ideal-world of her own cre-&#xD;
tion, where sue conjured into her presence, dark phantoms of roman-&#xD;
tic madness. Yet she was young and stately, and beautiful, and had&#xD;
she condescended to inhabit the earth, and partake freely of its pleas-&#xD;
ures like myself she would not have driven my love into other and&#xD;
criminal ena'nels. But be that as it may, I have determined to sell&#xD;
all my estates, place the proceeds in the funds, and start immediate.&#xD;
ly for America. As for her I know she is in possession of a large&#xD;
property in her own right, therefore she will need none of mine."&#xD;
I am 'lad to hear," replied Lord Fitzsimmnons, " that you are&#xD;
going to Anerica, I intend soon to do the same thing myself, as I&#xD;
have large estates mnVirginia that sadly need my oversight in per.&#xD;
bon-.My young and only son will accompany me, and if it suit&#xD;
your convemience,my dear Lord George, we will both go at the&#xD;
same time, and by the same conveyance."&#xD;
"A thousand thanks, my dear Lord Henry, for your generous of-&#xD;
fer, and I gladly accept it, as I am  firmly resolved to leave nothing&#xD;
undone in the endeavor to gain tidings of my injured wife and child."&#xD;
So saying the noble Lords shook hands and parted.&#xD;
Meantitmetlie little Zoraida, (for that name had been applied to her&#xD;
from the first,) grew up to be a fair and delicate girl. She knew no&#xD;
other parents then Iezekiah and his wife; to little Anna, she confi-&#xD;
ded all hr joys and sorrows during the period of her childhood, and&#xD;
aloshared with Anna the little affe t(,5ofhi-brterGore&#xD;
eatio~ns of her brother George.&#xD;
Though gentie in her manners and disposition as the most timid of&#xD;
her white playmates, she would show symptoms, when in the least&#xD;
excited, of the high spirit and bold daring of the brave Indian.&#xD;
Although the junior of Anna, by four years, she greatly excelled-&#xD;
her in travellin the wild woods, and climbing the rocky precipices,&#xD;
and unlike her too, she appeared to be very fond of the Indians, and&#xD;
they of her.&#xD;
The money found at stated times in the cavern was punctually&#xD;
aproieed tt- use, and nothing occurred to her worthy of  &#xD;

THE ALPINE GUIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
At that time, upon a fine summer afternoon, when the- sun. was&#xD;
shedding his farewell beams on the departing day, she and Anna&#xD;
might have been seen seated on a board seat that George had prepared&#xD;
for them at the bottom of a little flower garden before spoken of,&#xD;
in conversation apparently important and interesting to them both,&#xD;
for they heeded not the presence of a tall dusky form, that stood&#xD;
erect behind the little hedge that divided the garden from the woods&#xD;
beyond.&#xD;
" So, Anna," said the lovely Zoraida, looking up into the blushing&#xD;
face of her companion, " I have heard that m  your late visit to&#xD;
Boston, you have attracted the attention of a young gentleman and&#xD;
are about to be married to him. Tell me now, my dear Anna, have I&#xD;
heard true or false !"&#xD;
" Dear Zoraida," replied the still blushing Anna, "in the course of&#xD;
our young lives 1 have never kept from you a secret, and I shall not&#xD;
begin now. What you have heard is true. You know that I have&#xD;
spent the greater portion of the last year with my invalid aunt, in&#xD;
Boston. "Twas there I first met and soon after loved, Henry&#xD;
Fitzsimmons. He is soon to visit us, and ask the consent of my&#xD;
parents, to our immediate union, and dear Zoraida, when you see&#xD;
him, all gentleness and beauty as he is, you will not wonder at my&#xD;
choice."&#xD;
" Oh I" exclaimed Zoraida, as the burning tears coursed down her&#xD;
pale cheeks, " how lonely I shall be when you are gone. On whom&#xD;
else shall I bestow my love ?"&#xD;
" Do not talk so, my more than sister," replied Anna, "are you&#xD;
not-called the pride and beauty of the village ? Do not all the hand-&#xD;
some young men of the village, to say nothing of the proud Indian&#xD;
Chief Chenusa, strive in every way to gain your favorable attention.&#xD;
Ha !" continued the fair girl, playfully, "if I had half so many beaus&#xD;
at my heels as you have, I should have been married long ago."&#xD;
",Alas !" replied Zoraida, " I love them not, I heed them not. But,&#xD;
Anna, I have often thought if perchance such favors were ever granted&#xD;
to us wicked mortals, that I should like to tear away the dark veil&#xD;
that separated us from the future, and become acquainted with its in-&#xD;
penetrable mysteries."&#xD;
" Your wish shall be gratified, if you have the courage to brave the&#xD;
dread ordeal," came from behind the hedge. In an instant the hedge&#xD;
was cleared, and Zoraida, The Witch of Naumkeag, confronted the as&#xD;
tonished and bewildered maidens.&#xD;
"Tremble. not," said the Witch to Anna, whose slender frame shiv&#xD;
ered with horror and surprise at the sight of the strange being before&#xD;
her-" my business is not with such as thee. I would speak a few,'&#xD;
words with thy fearless companion, who but now expressed a fatal&#xD;
wish to penetrate the dark made of the future.&#xD;
"Maiden of the pale face, but the brave heart," continued the&#xD;
Witch, suddenly assuming in a measure, her Indian manner and lan-&#xD;
guage, "art thou willing to depart for a short time from thy pale-raced&#xD;
companions, in company with the daughter of the Chief of the Golden&#xD;
&#xD;
Waters, in order to have revealed to thee something as regards thy&#xD;
future destiny ?".&#xD;
" Lead on !" exclaimed the feArless Zoraida, "I will follow."&#xD;
" Oh, dear Zoraida," exclaimed the weeping and trembling Anna,&#xD;
as both she and the Witch began to-move away in the direction of the&#xD;
woods; "do not go with that fearful being. Remember what our&#xD;
father has told us of the dark doings of the emissaries of Satan, who&#xD;
have of late appeared among us in the shape of old women, whom&#xD;
he has entangled in his toils, and then led to death. Again," said she&#xD;
more vehemently, as the distance between her and her companion in-&#xD;
creased, "I adjure you, Zoraida, not to depart inl company with the&#xD;
Witch."&#xD;
But her solemn adjuration was neither heeded nor answered, for erp&#xD;
it was concluded, the fair form of Zoraida, and the tall, stately, ana&#xD;
noble form of the Witch, had disappeared amongst the gigantic oaks&#xD;
and pines of the adjoining forest.&#xD;
Hurrying her companion through woods and over plains, the Witch&#xD;
thus addressed her:&#xD;
" Brave girl, a sorrowful moment will it be for thee, when the wish&#xD;
that you expressed to yon trembling girl shall be gratified. When&#xD;
at your age, the same desires and thoughts, and feelings, had taken A&#xD;
strong hold upon my mind, so strong, that ,I haveever since lived in&#xD;
the future. But 'twas a terrible life. The imagination of such vision-&#xD;
aries will conjure up a thousand phantoms of misery, which, concealed&#xD;
under the bright mask of glory, tends to lead on the pursuers, until&#xD;
they find themselves engulphed in a horrible reality of cares and sor-&#xD;
rows. But perhaps, maiden, thou understandest not the meaning of&#xD;
my wild wrds, and happy would it be for thee, if thou shouldst al-&#xD;
ways remain ignorant of their sad purports."&#xD;
Zoraida did not attempt to reply to the lofty words of her compan-&#xD;
ion, and they hurried on in silence, until emerging from the woods,&#xD;
they found themselves overshadowed by the ancient branches of the&#xD;
Indian oak, and near to the cavern before spoken of.&#xD;
Easily finding, bg the light of the bright full moon, the entrance of&#xD;
the cave, which Indian ingenuity had contrived to conceal, and pushing&#xD;
aside the thick foliage of two bushes, which served instead of both&#xD;
outlet and entrance, the Witch, followed by Zoraida, entered the cav-&#xD;
een ; the Witch telling her companion to remain still, as the darkness&#xD;
was intense, until she should strike a light. Zoraida, whose courage&#xD;
now for the first time began to falter, tremblingly obeyed, whilst her&#xD;
companion groping her way to a shelf at the side of the rock, took&#xD;
from thence a small box, and, by the Indian mode of obtaining fire,&#xD;
that is, by rubbing two dry sticks violently, one against the of her, she&#xD;
soon succeeded in accomplishing her object. As the lamp threw a&#xD;
brilliant light around the cavern, both the Witch and her companion&#xD;
were surprised at seeing crouched in the farthest corner of it, the&#xD;
dusky and savage form of an Indian Warrior. He arose and confront-&#xD;
ed them as soon as he became aware of their presence, but the Witch&#xD;
was the first to break the silence.&#xD;

"What seeks Wacumea of the Narragansetts, in the dark wigwam&#xD;
of the daughter of the Chief of the Golden Waters ? Let the Red&#xD;
Warrior reply."&#xD;
" The Great Spirit," answered Wacumea,    is angry with the&#xD;
Narra gansetts; the son of their Chief is sick, his bones are weak,&#xD;
he hears the war-whoops, of the Pequods, but the strength of his arm&#xD;
is gone, he cannot answer it. Let the medicine woman of Naumkeag&#xD;
go to him, and he will again be strong, and the scalps of the enemies&#xD;
will again be seen in his wigwam. Will the daughter of the Chief&#xD;
of the Golden Water go ?"&#xD;
"Seest thou, Wacumca," replied the Witch, pointing to Zoraida,&#xD;
"tbis young squaw of the Yengees; she is dear, very dear to me ,&#xD;
I have just oaken her from her parents ; her feet are young and tender ;&#xD;
she is tired and would rest. Ere many morns, and the daughter of&#xD;
the Chief of the Golden Waters will leave her a wigwam, and go to&#xD;
the far off Spirit Land, and who but she, the young Zoraida shall take&#xD;
her place. The wigwam of Wacumca is far off and enemies are in&#xD;
the path, but ere five suns have gone from east to west, the medicine&#xD;
woman of Naunileag, and the beautiful and brave Zoraida will visit&#xD;
it. Will Wacumca say more."&#xD;
" The daughter of the Chief of the Golden Waters is wise,"&#xD;
replied the Warrior, " and her words are fair ; Wacumea is satis-&#xD;
fied." So saying, he drew about him his deer-skin robe, and immedi-&#xD;
ately left the cavern.&#xD;
"Notest thou, fair maiden," said the Witch, after the departure of&#xD;
the Warrior, " the power that I possess, so that the bold- and brave&#xD;
Warriors of the Red Race come from far distant tribes, to have their&#xD;
sick braves raised up by the skill"of the medicine woman?  Still&#xD;
although they think so, and although the pale faces think so too, yet I&#xD;
am not of tuem, 1 was once-but no matter, we are tired and will&#xD;
now rest."&#xD;
Thus saying, she removed a broad flat stone from the entrance to&#xD;
another apartment of the cavern, which by the assistance of the&#xD;
Indians of the neighborhood, had been rendered much more commo-&#xD;
dious than the outer one. It contained a table, two large oaken seats,&#xD;
and a sinll but comfortable looking bed, and a large oaken chest&#xD;
also occupied one corner of this strange abode. After they had&#xD;
entered, the Witch open the chest, and taking froin it a basket, she&#xD;
locked it, and carefully placed the key in her bosom. She then uncovered&#xD;
the basket, which contained provisions, of tlhe nicest quality, and&#xD;
setting them in order upon the table, she thus addremed her&#xD;
companion&#xD;
"Eat, daughter, and refresh thyself, for to-morrow thou mayest&#xD;
avert need, but not title. If thou repentest not the bold step thou&#xD;
hast taken, I see before us a long, a weary, and a perilous journey.&#xD;
Therefore daughter, if thou thinkest thou hast not courage and&#xD;
strength equal to the undertaking, I will to-morrow return thee in&#xD;
safety to thy parents, and prosecute my journey alone."&#xD;
Mother,'' replied Zoraida, " I know not why it is, but when in&#xD;

&#xD;
your presence, I feel as though I was where I ought to be; I feel as&#xD;
though I was where I was beloved. I have often heard my parents&#xD;
speak of you; they called you Witch; said that you possessed&#xD;
charms; that you ought to' have been hung along with the poor&#xD;
wretched unfortunates who have suffered that cruel penalty. And&#xD;
when they said such words, some invisible agency seemed to prompt&#xD;
me to a terrible and deadly revenge, aye, revenge against the best of&#xD;
parents, but I crushed such horrid feelings, and after such seasons had&#xD;
passed, I would retire intd the dark woods, and weep for whole hours,&#xD;
and pray that such vindictive thoughts might be totally eradicated&#xD;
from my bosom. And now, although in your presence, I feel a sort&#xD;
of strange dread which I cannot define, yet I will not leave you.&#xD;
Whither thou goest, there also will I go."&#xD;
Daughter," replied the Witch, in a softer tone than she had ever&#xD;
before assumed in conversation with her, " thou sayest that thy&#xD;
parents called me Witch ; I have passed through severe and fiery or-&#xD;
deals to gain the title, and n it lays the whole secret of my power.&#xD;
But now we will retire to rest."&#xD;
In a few moments, this strange being and her young companion,&#xD;
were wrapped in the happy forgetfulness of sound repose.&#xD;
About an hour after the old folks had retired to rest, a slight rust-&#xD;
ling was heard among the bushes in frontof the house, and soon the&#xD;
light and graceful form of the fair Zoraicla was seen toemerge from&#xD;
their covering, and approach the open window of Norris's house.&#xD;
" I wished to see you, my Anna," said she, after she had got within&#xD;
speaking distance, " for the purpose of bidding you farewell, as I ant&#xD;
about to depart to-morrow with the Witch, as you call her, to some&#xD;
distant part of the country, where her talents as a medicine-wonan&#xD;
are to be put in requisition."&#xD;
Dear Zoraida," exclaimed Anna, " you shall not go, nay ; you&#xD;
must not: come, do come in. lIenury Fitzsimrnons is here, and I&#xD;
wish you to be made acquainted with him."&#xD;
I may be glad to make his acquaintance," replied Zoraida, " for&#xD;
the selfish purpose of requesting his company back with me to the&#xD;
place front whence I came, for in my progress hither, I saw several&#xD;
suspicious and dusky forms, that seemed to watch me, and I feel some-&#xD;
what fearful that all is not right."&#xD;
Seeing that Anna was about to speak, she said&#xD;
Do iot urge me to slay, Aana, for it w;ll be useless, as I have&#xD;
given my word to her whom you call the Witch and it cannot nor&#xD;
shall no,, be forfeited. Therefore, if Mr. Fitzsiminons will acompa-&#xD;
ny me back, I will thank him."&#xD;
" Certainly," said our chivalrous hero, starting from his seat, and&#xD;
preparing to go, "thatis, if Anna here will promise not to be jealous"&#xD;
So saying, and telling Anna to be a good giol till he returned, he&#xD;
left the house, and joining Zoraida, they immediately took the path&#xD;
leading to the Witch's Cavern.&#xD;
But an unexpected stop was soon put to their careerfor theyhad&#xD;

party of about eight or ten Indians darted out of the thick woods,&#xD;
and in less time than it will take to chronicle it, had taken Henry and&#xD;
Zoraida prisoners, gagged and bound them, and immediately disap-&#xD;
peared again into the woods, taking their prisoners along with them.&#xD;
Under the verandah of a commodious mansion, situated upon one&#xD;
of the finest plantations on the confines of James River, in Virginia,&#xD;
about a month previous to the events related in the last chapter of.&#xD;
our history, might have been seen -sitting a person who has before&#xD;
been introduced to the reader under the title of Lord Henry Fitzsim-&#xD;
mions. In his hands he holds a letter, which he seems to be diligently&#xD;
perusing, when all at once he starts, and pacing backwards and for&#xD;
wards, exclaims:&#xD;
" Well, this is a pretty kettle of fish; Ilenriy Fitzsimmons junior,&#xD;
son of a lord of that ilk, very good-humnoredly and peremptorily an-&#xD;
nounces to his indulgent father that he is engaged to be married to&#xD;
the daughter of one Hezekiah Norris, whom he denominates as one&#xD;
of the most substantial farmers of that den of witchcraft and super-&#xD;
stition, Salem.&#xD;
" Here," said the old man, speaking to an Indian In attendance,&#xD;
who appeared to be servant of the family ; "go to the library and&#xD;
acquaint the minister that I wish him to join me here immediately."&#xD;
" What has happened, my dear Lord Henry," asked the minister,&#xD;
entering the apart ineit, " to cause such an unusual excitement in your&#xD;
manner and bearing ?"&#xD;
" Happened !" exclaimed his enraged companion, thrusting into the&#xD;
minister's hand the opei letter, then pulling it away again, he threw&#xD;
it on the ground, and continued " Why, you see, George, that my&#xD;
dutiful son to show his gratitude, I suppose, for my making the&#xD;
trouble and expense of giving him the best education the country&#xD;
aflrds, sends me word very coolly that he intends taking to wife the&#xD;
accomplished daughter of a substantial farmer ."&#xD;
"I do not see what objection you can have to that, my dear Lord&#xD;
Henry," replied the mninister.&#xD;
" Objection, why only think, I say, for an instant, of the complete&#xD;
absurdity of iny son-the son 6f' an English Peer marrying a farmer's&#xD;
daughter ! But if I can I will prevent it. I will to-morrow start for&#xD;
Boston, and my object in sending for you, Herbert, was to see if you&#xD;
Would not hear me company."&#xD;
Certainly, Lord Henry," replied thenim.ster, 1 will gladly go with&#xD;
"on, although I think, as it regards your sots case, it will avail but&#xD;
little, for where a man really loves, let the ooject of his affections be&#xD;
high or low, he will seldom be entreated much less compelled to give it&#xD;
up. But how are you going "&#xD;
tW by," answered his companion, " we wits take passage in Capt.&#xD;
O ulter's sloop which sails fromthe town to-morrow with a load of&#xD;
tobacco. Then we must trust to Providence, and our good luck, if&#xD;
we happen to have any, for a conveyance to Boston."&#xD;
Therefore the next morning after getting every thing in readiness,&#xD;
Sur friends took their departure, and in about a fortnight arrived sate-&#xD;
&#xD;
THE' ALPINE     GUIDE.93&#xD;
ly in New York, where they had the good luck to find another sloop&#xD;
bound to Rhode Island and- Providence plantations, and on board of&#xD;
her they went, and off they started, but they had not proceeded more&#xD;
than two days' sail, before a violent storm arose, and they were driven&#xD;
ashore upon the Connecticut sea-board, where they had hardly time&#xD;
to offer up thanks for their deliverance from the perils of the sea, be-&#xD;
fore a party of Pequod Indians had seized upon and made them pris-&#xD;
oners.&#xD;
" Ah !" exclaimed Lord Henry, upon finding that his journey bid&#xD;
fair to end very tragically, " if I had dreamed of this, Henry might&#xD;
have married all the infernal Indian squaws in the country and be&#xD;
hanged to him, before I would have troubled myself about either him&#xD;
or them."&#xD;
Their enemies having led them in triumph to their village, they&#xD;
were all placed in a large wigwam, and well guarded, whilst their In-&#xD;
dian captors proceeded to hold a council-to determine their ftte. The&#xD;
council soon assembled in the centre of the village, when after sitting&#xD;
for some time in silence, an aged warrici' opened it as follows:&#xD;
Brothers, the Great Spirit has given into our hands these&#xD;
pale faces, who burnt our houses, and took.our scalps-that in return&#xD;
we might take theirs also. Let the pale faces die. I have spoken."&#xD;
A stifled narmur of approbation ran through the council at these&#xD;
words, and the prisoners were dooined to innediate torture and&#xD;
death. Each one of the prisoners was then brought forth, stripped.&#xD;
and bound to stak s, and the Indians were about commencing the&#xD;
death-song when another warrior spoke as Follows:&#xD;
Brothers, shall the pale face and his sister, whom  we took from&#xD;
the Narragausetts, die ?  I say let the pale face, warrior die, but let&#xD;
the squaw, his sister, live. I have spoken."&#xD;
Another murmur of approbation ran round the circle, another stake&#xD;
was planted, and the young Henry Fitzsinicons, followed by the beau&#xD;
tiful Zornada, was led to the stake of death.&#xD;
In van did the weeping and distracted girl plead for him ; in vain&#xD;
did she throw herself between hun and death, for. her merciless and&#xD;
savage foes soon bound her, then gagged and left her on the ground in&#xD;
a state not to be described. They had piled faggots around the un-&#xD;
fortunate prisoners, and they were preparing to set fire to them, when&#xD;
suddenly the shrill war-whoop was heard, and a band of Mohawks,&#xD;
with which nation t ie Pequods were then at war, completely surprised&#xD;
them, killing many and taking the rest prisoners.&#xD;
These new visitors then unbound the white prisoners from the&#xD;
stakes, and substituted in their stead the Peqod warriors they had&#xD;
just taken. The fires of death were lighted, and they soon underwent&#xD;
the same cruelties which just before they were about to inflict upon&#xD;
the pale faces.&#xD;
After the departure of Henry Fitszimmons w th Zoraida as before&#xD;
noted, poor Anna sat for some tine in a patient but anxious expeeta-&#xD;
tion of Henry's return.-But hour lifter hour rolled by, and still he&#xD;
did not return, sad, and melancholy, and despairing hours were they&#xD;

to Anna Norris. At last her delicate frame gave under the agonizing&#xD;
suspense caused by the prolonged and unaccountable absence of&#xD;
sury, and insattempting to rise, for the purpose of calling her fa-&#xD;
ther,,her strength failed her, she sank in a deadly swoon upon the&#xD;
floor.&#xD;
Meantime, there was one, waiting as patiently, and expecting as&#xD;
anxiously the return of the young Zoraida, as Anna was that of&#xD;
eiry,s ai that one was the Witch of Naumkeag, the, solitary inha-&#xD;
bitant of the Cavern by the Indian Oak. But after hours had elapsed&#xD;
and she did not return, the Witch rose from the bed, upon which she&#xD;
had reclined, and hastily putting on her Indian dress, she left the&#xD;
Cavern and took the path leading to Norris's house.&#xD;
aV   en she arose from the bed," soliloquized the Witch, speaking&#xD;
of Z-orida, as she swiftly travelled the path by the light of the full&#xD;
nidnighlt ioon, "she told me that she was only going to bid her sis-&#xD;
ter 0rew ell, and then she would directly return, and I took her at&#xD;
her word ; and were it not that I believed that she was too much like&#xD;
her mother to forfeit it, I should think they had persuaded her to re-&#xD;
main with them. But be it as it may, I will now unravel the mys-&#xD;
tery."&#xD;
Thus soliloquizing, she walked on more swiftly than before, and had&#xD;
nearly reached the open space in front of Norris's house, when a tall&#xD;
shadow darkened the path, and immediately the stately form and&#xD;
features of Wacumca, second chief of the Narragansetts, boldly cou-&#xD;
fi cited her.&#xD;
The medicine woman of the Naumkeag," said he, addressing her,&#xD;
" seeks her lost bird of the forest. Let her seek in the lodge of the&#xD;
Narragansetts. Wacult no has spoken."&#xD;
No saying and before his auditors had time to answer him, the In-&#xD;
dian warrior had darted into the woods and disappeared.&#xD;
intimately acquainted as was the Witch with the metaphorical lan-&#xD;
guage of the Indian tribes, she was at no loss in coming to the c.n-&#xD;
glusio that Zoraida had been entrapped and carried off by the&#xD;
attendants of Waeumaca, in order that she, the far famed medicine&#xD;
oman, might speedily hasten to the lodge of the Chief Sachem, for&#xD;
the purpose of curing his sick son ; but for all that she had a latent&#xD;
y ip that she might find the object of her solicitude at the house of&#xD;
Norris. She therefore emerged from the woods and seeing the door&#xD;
ot the house open, she abruptly entered the lower apartment, where&#xD;
the first object hat her cager gaze ecuntered was the prostrate form&#xD;
of Anna,  ho was jut begittninu to recover from the swoon into&#xD;
which she had fallen.&#xD;
Anna Noreis," said the Witch, dropping for the time her Indian&#xD;
mannerf speaking  " tell me, I a jure thee, if thou knowest aught of&#xD;
mn  orai a. Have you seen her ? Has she been here l"&#xD;
" Out upon thee, Witch !" exclaimed the indignant, Anna, as soon&#xD;
as she had recovered sufliciently to speak, " well dost thou know&#xD;
where she is. Begone instantly, tell deceivet, or I u ill call my&#xD;
father."&#xD;

lut there was no need of that, for the old gentleman at that instant&#xD;
descended the stairs, having been awakened from his sound repose by&#xD;
the loud tone of the Witch's voice, which she had assumed in speal..&#xD;
iltg to tti. His wvife sootijolited hill, and theni, in that little roinml,&#xD;

m igantly at the tall and stately form of the Witch, while&#xD;
site, totally tititnoved, stood against the wvittdow, calmly awaiting the&#xD;
the issue of the scene ; and Ilezekiah aind his wife, suddenly aroused&#xD;
fiom a sound sleep, coitfused and bewildered, invested the whole with&#xD;
ati air of' solet ti ltdicrousutess, which would have formed an equally&#xD;
happy subject for the poet as well as the paintter.&#xD;
h'aput to return.  Alter J4ezekiah had in a measure recovered from&#xD;
his unfeigned surprise,'he demanded of the Witch the cause of the ii-&#xD;
trusion imito his house at that late hour of the night.&#xD;
I came," siuswered the witch, calmly, "to seek her whom, when&#xD;
she was an infant, I left in thy safe-keeping ; but she is not here.&#xD;
And-" she was about to have said more, but the old man sternly&#xD;
bid her to remain silent whilst Anna proceeded to give an account of&#xD;
tCe re-appearance of Zoraida and her departure with Henry .Fitzsin-&#xD;
mons, and concluded by saying,&#xD;
"Father, I solemnly and sincerely believe, that the limb of Satan,&#xD;
that Witch, who now stands so lofty in your presence, has delivered&#xD;
the nboth p to our Indian enemies, with whom    I know she is in&#xD;
close leainue.&#xD;
Begone from iy house instantly    exlaied Hezekiah, incensed&#xD;
by the words of.Anita, " and never agaim dare to desecrate its thresh-&#xD;
old with thy presence."&#xD;
Slowly, yet with a firm and lofty step, the Witch moved towards&#xD;
the door, which having gained, she turned and casting towards Anna&#xD;
a look of withering contempt, she said,&#xD;
Prou' girl, feeling as I do the bitter injustice of thy words, I&#xD;
could curse thee for them, but I will not ; for, if my own-eyes tell me&#xD;
true, ec you bright moon cmes again to its fullness, thy fair ft'im,&#xD;

So say itng, this strange being departed from the house and wended&#xD;
her wVay back agaimi to the Cavern.&#xD;

&#xD;
After they had feasted their savage cruelty upon their enemies in&#xD;
true Indian style, the band of Mohawks before mentioned, with their&#xD;
yhite prisoners, took up their line of march northward towards the&#xD;
location of their tribe.&#xD;
In a few days they arrived with the prisoners at the lodge of the&#xD;
Chief Sachem of the tribe, where they were civilly 'treated, and ac-&#xD;
quainted, through an interpreter, with the cause of their singular&#xD;
capture and detention.-Through this medium, they learnt that Wa-&#xD;
cuica had formed and executed the curious stratagem of taking them&#xD;
prisoners for no other purpose than that of receiving the prompt and&#xD;
immediate attendance of the famed medicine woman upon the sick&#xD;
sun of their Chie.&#xD;
But they did not have time to await the success of their strange&#xD;
project, for a detachment frontt the large and peaceful tribe of Pequods&#xD;
with whom they were then at war, cane upon them the very next&#xD;
day after Hlenry and Zoraida had arrived at the lodge, killed their&#xD;
Chief Sachem and his sick son, burnt theix wigwams, and carried off&#xD;
a large numiner of prisoners amongst whom was Henry and his com-&#xD;
panion.     .&#xD;
leaving made the above explanation to his father, Henry with the&#xD;
rest of the prisoners and their Indian captors, being greatly fatigued&#xD;
by their forced marches, laid themselves down upon nature's green&#xD;
carpet, with no covering except the broad canopy of the summer&#xD;
sky, and were soon enjoying the repose which their tired and exhaus-&#xD;
ted situations rendered necessary for theta. They might have been&#xD;
thus reposing some two or three hours, when the guard suddenly&#xD;
gave the alarm, crying out, "the Yeugees ! the Yengees !"&#xD;
Upon hearing this alarmit, both prisoners and captors sprung almost&#xD;
sirnultaneously to their feet, and dire was he constarnatiou ainongs-t&#xD;
the lIndians aind great was the joy of the prisoners when they heard&#xD;
the cheering sound of an approaching drum, and the shrill notes of&#xD;
the martial fife.&#xD;
Ere the miinus could gather their weapons, or yell forth their&#xD;
horrid war-whoop, they were surrounded by w company of whites, the&#xD;
captain of whom eotmatnded them instantly to  surrender, under&#xD;
pain of being immediately fired upon if they refused.&#xD;
Being hemmed in upon all sides, and finding that they could not do&#xD;
any better, the Mohawks were forced to agree to an unconditional&#xD;
and iinmediate surrender when their white prisoners soon recieved&#xD;
the congratulations of the brave soldiers, who had so providentially&#xD;
and unexpectedly released them from bondage.&#xD;
What a strange and unaccountable passion is true love. Confine it&#xD;
as we may, under all conventional forms and usages 'of civilized so-&#xD;
ciety, and still it vill secretly penetrate bosoms 'where it has no-&#xD;
right t, enter, and there, locked up in the most secret recesses of&#xD;
the  heart, drive its unfortunate victims to despair and death.&#xD;
Thus it was with the young Zoraida.&#xD;
After her unexpected capture by the attendants of Wacumca, when&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ALPINE GUIDE.                       97&#xD;
the beautiful light of the' ensuing morning first revealed to her the,&#xD;
handsome features and noble form of Henry Fitzsimmons, the conisu-&#xD;
ming, burning ardor of the most passionate love took immediate pos.&#xD;
session of her sensitive bosom. But being fully aware of his situa-&#xD;
tion towards Anna Norris, she betrayed not to him, either by word or&#xD;
look, the least symptom of, her hopeless passion, but she nobly re-&#xD;
solved to endeavor to eradicate it from her bosom; Poor thing, she.&#xD;
little knew what a Herculean task she had undertaken to perform..&#xD;
But, in accordance with her determination, although in their strange&#xD;
situation she and Henry were necessarily together, she treated him&#xD;
with a coldness and reserve, which, considering her as he did to be&#xD;
Anna's sister, pained and surprised him. Therefore on the night to&#xD;
which we have brought our story, when at supper, George had obscure-&#xD;
ly hinted at Henry's future union with Anna, sharp pangs of jealous&#xD;
despair had pierced the heart of the unfortunate Zoraida.'' And that&#xD;
night, when she retired into her tent she wept, and then prayed that&#xD;
such unholy passions might be driven away from her bosom, but it&#xD;
was of no avail; so towards morning, being unable to sleep, he left&#xD;
her tent, and passing the guard, she paced wildly and swiftly tae little&#xD;
open space upon the border of the dark pine-woods. She had not&#xD;
walked long before a low voice interrupted her by calling out,&#xD;
"Zoraida ?"&#xD;
She turned and beheld George Norris standing beside her.&#xD;
" Be not alarmed, dear Zoraida," he said, "at my intrusion upon&#xD;
your privacy, for I felt anxious to speak to you a few words ere we&#xD;
depart from this spot."&#xD;
" George," answered Zoraida, " in the bygone days and happy hours&#xD;
of our childhood, you were always wont to speak your thoughts and&#xD;
wishes to me without restraint, and I know not that your absence has&#xD;
debarredyou from now taking the same privilege. Speak on."&#xD;
"Dear Zoraida," replied George, " I will not longer conceal from&#xD;
you the true feelings of my heart. By accidentally overhearing a&#xD;
conversation between my father and mother, I became acquainted&#xD;
with the fact, that you were not my sister ; and having always felt&#xD;
towards you more than brotherly love, now' that you have given&#xD;
me the privilege of speaking my feelings, I will tell. you, that to-&#xD;
wards you they are none ocher than feelings of the most deep and&#xD;
fervent love. If so be, dear Zoraida, that my suit be favorably re-&#xD;
garded by you, here on this spot, with yonder ntorning star for my&#xD;
witness, [ pledge to you my hand and heart."&#xD;
"George," replied Zoraida, turning towards him her pale and care-&#xD;
worn features, "although before it was never whispered to me by&#xD;
mortal lips, that I was not your sister, yet from  my earliest child-&#xD;
hood I always felt within my bosom the most incontrovertable evi-&#xD;
dence of the fact, therefore in respect to that, you have a right to&#xD;
love me if you will, but I must tell you, George, for the first and,&#xD;
last time that your passion can never by me be returned. It grieves&#xD;
me.to wound a.heart so noble and true as I believe yours to be, yet&#xD;
I must solemnly entreat you, by the remembrance of our earlier&#xD;

and happier days, never more to lisp to me that cruel, yet sweet&#xD;
word, Love. No," continued she drawing herself up to her full height.&#xD;
"if you would not drive me from your presence into yon dreary wil-&#xD;
derness, avoid forever speaking to me as you have this morning.&#xD;
Ask me no reasons for what may appear to you unaccountable and&#xD;
ungenerous conduct on my part, for the time may soon come when&#xD;
you will learn all. When we meet again let us be as we have al-&#xD;
ways have been, brother and sister." So saying she turned abruptly&#xD;
from him and entered her tent ?&#xD;
Poor George, stood for some time motionless. Thunder-struck at&#xD;
the fatal blow his long cherished hopes had just received, it was some&#xD;
time ere he could decide how for the future to act. But with a&#xD;
buoyant heart always alive to man's sweetest and best angel, Hope,&#xD;
he said-&#xD;
"Perhaps by paying her every little attention, and striving in&#xD;
every way that I can to show my deep devotion to her I may yet&#xD;
succeed in gaining her affections. Indeed I will try."&#xD;
Having formed this very reasonable and philosophical resolution.&#xD;
Norris, with a heart somewhat lighter than when Zoraida first left&#xD;
him, turned and entered the encampment. In his way to his .tent he&#xD;
discovered our friend Drubbits, the chaplain, advancing towards him&#xD;
with a countenance so extremely lugubrious and disconsolate that he&#xD;
could hardly refrain from laughing aloud at poor Jerry's uncouth&#xD;
appearance&#xD;
"Our worthy chaplain," said George, " seems to have taken the&#xD;
field early this morning. How happens it in"&#xD;
"Capt. George," solemnly replied Jeremiah, "I have discovered&#xD;
in this camp, aye, even in the very apartment where I have spent the&#xD;
night, my mortal enemy, yea, even him who did smite me unto the&#xD;
earth with his fists in the beautiful little garden which lays behind&#xD;
your father's house. Lo, Lo, the Lord hath delivered him, even mine&#xD;
enemy into my hand, and vengeance is mine, and I, even I, will re-&#xD;
pay it."  So saying he began to make sundry war-like demonstra-&#xD;
tions with his withered fists, which, if George ha- not stepped back,&#xD;
would have come in contact with his nose, but of which he took no&#xD;
farther notice than to laugh outright, saying at the same time:&#xD;
" My good Mr. Drubbits, allay your wrath till after our morning&#xD;
meal, when I will inquire into this matter, and have it definitely&#xD;
settled, ere we leave this place."&#xD;
" Verily," replied Jerry, "although the young man hath wounded'&#xD;
me in a sore point, inasmuch as he came between me and the beloved&#xD;
of my heart, still if he repenteth and asketh my forgiveness, as I am&#xD;
a wuan of peace rather than war I will grant it unto him."&#xD;
" But," asked George, as he took the worthy chaplain's arm and&#xD;
walked with him towards the tent, " how did you happen to recog-&#xD;
nize the young man, your enemy as you term him? V&#xD;
"1Why," replied Drubbits, "amongst the rest of the prisoners&#xD;
which the Lord  through our instrumentality, delivered from; the&#xD;
blood thirsty Indians was a godly pious man whose name was&#xD;

Herbert. When we were about retiring to rest last night, this man&#xD;
asked the privilege of returning thanks to God for the happy deliver-&#xD;
ance of himself and companions from their enemies. The privilege&#xD;
having been by me joyfully granted to him; he commenced and made&#xD;
such a fervent, and such an appropriate prayer, that verily my bowels&#xD;
yearned towards him, even as a mother for her child, and at the&#xD;
conclusion of it I could not refrain from taking him by the hand and&#xD;
warmly-embracing him. In a conversation which I held with him&#xD;
after the rest of the company had gone to sleep, I found out that&#xD;
this Henry Fitzsimmons, who aspires to your sister's hand, was the&#xD;
person who so unceremoniously knocked me down as I have told you&#xD;
before, in the little. garden. What vexed me more was that the&#xD;
young man had made a jest and sport of me to his father and Mr.&#xD;
Herbert, concerning this same affair. Surely it hath sorely troubled&#xD;
me, and the evil spirit rises within me, yea, even the unhallowed&#xD;
spirit of revenge, whenever I think of it."&#xD;
Having arrived at his quarters as Jerry concluded with this state-&#xD;
ment of facts, George immediately gave directions to have the men&#xD;
musteredd, and breakfast prepared, which was soon accomplished, and&#xD;
All had met at their respective stations to enjoy their morning meal.&#xD;
The same guests who had graced the table of Capt. Norris, the night&#xD;
previous, did not need a second summons to -appear in the morning.&#xD;
Soon seated at the table was the cheerful Lord Henry, and his&#xD;
anxious and impatient son, the mild and dignified, yet melancholy&#xD;
Herbert, Zoraida, with her countenance deathly pale, yet betraying&#xD;
no other sign of her recent emotion, and last but not least, our good&#xD;
friend Drubbits. He having craved a blessing, George common&#xD;
conversation by saying-&#xD;
"Henry, my dear fellow, our friend the chaplain here has entered&#xD;
a serious complaint against you for knocking him down in my father's&#xD;
little garden, coming in between him and his beloved, and so forth ;&#xD;
now, we, as being umpire upon the occasion, would like to hear your&#xD;
version of the affair."&#xD;
Henry then proceeded to give a distinct and true account of the&#xD;
occurrences in the little garden, and after he had concluded, rose and&#xD;
gave poor Jerry his hand in token of repentance.&#xD;
"Verily," said Jerry, as he took Henry's extended hand, "young&#xD;
man, I forgive thee from the bottom of my heart." And so, dear&#xD;
reader, that matter ended.&#xD;
After breakfast was over George ordered immediate preparatians&#xD;
to be made for their departure, which being soon done, the whole&#xD;
company were quickly on their way to Salem.&#xD;
It was some days after the strange disappearance of Henry and&#xD;
Zoraida, before the burning fever had left Anna Norris. But it did&#xD;
leave her, although in such a weak and debilitated state as to give&#xD;
but small hopes of her ultimate recovery. After the wild delirium&#xD;
under which she had suffered during the fever, had left her, the fair&#xD;
sufferer called her mother to her bedside, and .thus addressed her-.&#xD;
" Mother I feel that my time in this world of cares and sorrow is&#xD;

short, and that soon I shall be called to depart to another and a better&#xD;
world."&#xD;
" 0 say not so, Anna, " answered her weeping mother, "the fever&#xD;
has left you, and I hope and trust that you will soon recover."&#xD;
" Mother," replied Anna, and her eyes sparlded with supernatural&#xD;
brilliancy as she spoke, " my hopes of happiness in this world were&#xD;
all centered upon one being, and in the deep devotion of my love for&#xD;
him, in the wildness of my fervent attachment, I had forgotten that&#xD;
my highest affections should have been bestowed upon my blessed&#xD;
Redeemer. By this sorrowful and afflicting dispensation he has been&#xD;
pleased to show me mine error, and now my thoughts of this world&#xD;
ars, as nothing to me, and I now feel it my duty to prepare myself as&#xD;
soon as may be for the change which I feel certain awaits me, yet, mo-&#xD;
ther I have prayed, and I hope there may not have been sin in the&#xD;
prayer, that -1 once more might behold my Henry, and my dear Zo-&#xD;
raida. Mother, come to me and kiss me, for I am weary and would&#xD;
sleep."  And her mother went to her and kissed her, and the beauti-&#xD;
ful girl sank gently back upon her pillow and slept, but 'twas a fear&#xD;
ful and troubled sleep, for every few moments she would give a con-&#xD;
vulsive start and say, "0 God ! the Indians ! the stake ! the fire ! my&#xD;
Henry-oh, save him !" and then her mother would soothe her, until&#xD;
she seemed to drop into-a peaceful sleep-and then her mother left,&#xD;
hoping that when Anna awoke she should find her better. Mrs. Nor-&#xD;
ris then joined her husband, and related to him Anna's conversation-&#xD;
with her, but the stern old man only answered, " the Lord's will be&#xD;
-done."'&#xD;
Next morning Anna awoke somewhat refreshed, but that evening&#xD;
she was weaker than before.&#xD;
As her father at her request was performing evening service a loud&#xD;
knocking was heard. The old man opening the door, Henry Fitzsim-&#xD;
mons rushed past him into the -apartment. When he had recovered&#xD;
sufficient breath he asked-&#xD;
" How is my Anna, is she still alive ?"&#xD;
" She is ;" replied the old man, " but Henry, the days of that dear&#xD;
child are numbered. It is the will of the Lord, Henry, and we should&#xD;
not murmur at it, but oh, (and the tears ran down the old man's burn-&#xD;
ing cheeks as he spoke,) human will asserts its prerogative and we&#xD;
must mourn, we must weep."&#xD;
Whilst the old man thus spoke, Henry began to weep convulsively&#xD;
and there they sat, two manly and stern specimens of God's handi-&#xD;
work ; the one young, the other old. bitterly weeping at the very&#xD;
idea of the death of that young and pure being so sincerely, yet dif-&#xD;
ferently loved by both.&#xD;
Whilst this scene was going on below, Anna, having heard, and&#xD;
immediately recognized that voice, suddenly seemed gifted with super-&#xD;
natural strength, for, throwing over her emaciated form some articles&#xD;
of clothing, she exclaimed, " It is him !" and with a quick step de-&#xD;
scended into the room below, and throwing herself into Henry's arms,&#xD;
she said-&#xD;
&#xD;
S&#xD;
L&#xD;
&#xD;
100&#xD;
&#xD;
*&#xD;
&#xD;
"Henry, if thou couldst have been blessed with the vision I had&#xD;
last night, thou wouldst not weep. henry, I dreamed of Heaven, but&#xD;
my tongue cannot describe its glories. And Henry, I felt too that it&#xD;
would be hard to part with thee, and my fervent prayer was, that I&#xD;
might live to behold once more the dear form of my affianced hus-&#xD;
band. God in his infinite mercy having seen fit to grant my prayer,&#xD;
I can now depart calmly and in peace." Throwing her eyes up to&#xD;
the window, she suddenly gave a wild scream of terror, and cxclaim-&#xD;
ing, "The Witch ! the Witch !" fell back in Henry's arms in a deadly&#xD;
swoon. Upon looking up, the old man beheld, standing upon the&#xD;
same spot where she had so prophetically pronounced the doom of&#xD;
Anna upon the night of Henry's departure, the stately form of Zorai-&#xD;
da, the Witch of Naumkeag ! But it was only for an instant, for the&#xD;
old man rudely grasped her arm, and said,&#xD;
" Witch ! how dare you taunt me with your accursed presence in&#xD;
this bitter hour of my distress ? Art thou not satisfied ?"&#xD;
"Hezekiah Norris," replied the Witch, mournfully, "I am no ene&#xD;
my to thee or thine, yet when in the sorrowful hour of my separation&#xD;
from her who is as dear to me as this pale flower is to you, you&#xD;
spurned me from your presence, I was constrained in the galling&#xD;
bitterness of my heart to utter the fatal prophecy. Your child dies&#xD;
peacefully and calmly in the home of her father, surrounded by those&#xD;
who are dear to her ; but mine oh, God ! has no home." Thus speak-&#xD;
ing, the woman rushed into the woods.&#xD;
Meanwhile Mrs. Norris, with the aid of the almost distracted&#xD;
Henry, had borne Anna to her chamber, where she again sank into a&#xD;
troubled sleep.&#xD;
The next morning the loud sound of a drum, gave notice to the&#xD;
denizens of Salem of the approach of their soldiers from a victorious&#xD;
campaign.&#xD;
Foremost amongst those who greeted the soldiers' return was&#xD;
Hezekiah Norris. Besides being a prominent town officer he felt a&#xD;
father's pride arise in his bosom at the thought of meeting his son,&#xD;
crowned as he was with the laurels of victory.&#xD;
Captain George dismissed the men, and hastened to inquire of&#xD;
Anna.&#xD;
"And here, father," said George, " see I have brought my other&#xD;
sister, the fair Zoraida, and should also have brought Anna's truant&#xD;
lover, Henry, but he stole a march upon us, and I suppose is here,&#xD;
ere this."&#xD;
" True," repiied Hezekiah, "he is here, he arrived last night in a&#xD;
state of great exhaustion and fatigue. And now my son George,"&#xD;
continued the old man, " you and your fair companion Zoraida( must&#xD;
.ccompany me without further delay to the bedside of that fair and&#xD;
'esigned sufferer."&#xD;
" But stop, dear father," said George, " ere we depart, suffer me&#xD;
to introduce to you' Henry's father, Lord Fitzsimmons and Mr.&#xD;
Herbert, a worthy minister of our Lord and Saviour."&#xD;
I should consider myself as doing injustice to both, were I to un-&#xD;
dertake to 'i'c '4he the meeting of Zoraida with Anna.&#xD;

THE ALPINE GUIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Having .bolstered the weak sufferer up, her mother descended, leav-&#xD;
ing the three together as Anna had desired, after which she called&#xD;
lenry to her bedside, and said to hii,&#xD;
" Henry dear, I feel that I am fhst going. I wish to speak to you&#xD;
concerning the sister of my heart, the friendless Zoraida.&#xD;
Henry Fitzsiinmons," said the dying girl solemnly, " to your pro-&#xD;
tection and in your care I leave her. Refuse ine not, Henry, my last,&#xD;
my dying request, but swear to ine that you will cherish and protect&#xD;
her, as you would me, if it should have pleased God to have suffered&#xD;
me to remain ou earth."&#xD;
"I swear," replied Henry, solemnly. As he concluded, Anna sank&#xD;
back upon the pillow, and her pure spirit returned unto him who gave&#xD;
it.&#xD;
The wild shriek of Zoraida, and the heavy fall of Henry brought&#xD;
quickly to the apartment the agonized parents, and their sympathising&#xD;
visitor.&#xD;
The remains of the gentle girl were shortly afterwards deposited in&#xD;
a new made grave in the village burial ground. After which they&#xD;
took the path leading to the Witch's Cavern.&#xD;
On arriving at the Indian Oak, the party halted, and soon the tall&#xD;
form of the Witch moved towards them from the cave.&#xD;
" I bid you all welcome," she said, coming up to them, " to the&#xD;
rough, yet secure shelter of my wild abode, and I ask you to enter&#xD;
my cave and partake of such poor hospitality as I may be able to show&#xD;
you."&#xD;
The young Zoraida was the first to press forward and in a few mo-&#xD;
mnents they had all entered that dark and romantic place of refuge.&#xD;
The witch soon struck a light, and turning to her visitors, said :&#xD;
"Methinks I see one among you, who young in years and strong in&#xD;
limbs, should be amongst these brave soldiers, who even now are con-&#xD;
tending with the savage enemy."&#xD;
Zoraida stepping forward, anticipated him by saying-&#xD;
" Mother, speak not harshly to the young man, for it was his ardent&#xD;
wish, expressed to Captain Norris, upon the receipt of your note, to&#xD;
go forth with him and fight by his side, but the captain reminded him&#xD;
of a solemn oath which dear Anna extorted from him, to protect me,&#xD;
yes, ine and her poor and friendless Zoraida."&#xD;
" Ah, that is well," replied the Witch, and continued she musingly,&#xD;
" two so young and handsome, surely there must be love at the bot-&#xD;
tom of all this ; however I shall soon ascertain the facts."  She had&#xD;
spoken the latter part of this speech in a low tone of voice, and at its&#xD;
conclusion, she turned suddenly to Lord Herbert, and looking him&#xD;
earnestly in the face, while her voice trembled with emotion, she said :&#xD;
" Your dress, sir, bespeaks you to be a minister of the Gospel; if&#xD;
I might take the liberty, 1 would ask, sir, if that be a fact."&#xD;
" In answering your question, madam," said Herbert, "I would&#xD;
merely state, that having spent my youth in giving loose rein to my&#xD;
wild passions and vicious habits, a sudden and unexpected calamity&#xD;
that came upon me as a thief in the night,' had the effect to bring&#xD;
&#xD;
a&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ALPINE GUIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
me to my senses, and led me seriously to reflect upon my previous&#xD;
conduct. I had taken for the partner of my bosom, a being beau-&#xD;
tiful and fair as the uncloudy sky, and as pure as she was beautiful,&#xD;
yet totally unfit for the station she had assumed. I could have no&#xD;
pleasures in common with her, and I soon became in a measure&#xD;
weaned from her, and sought amongst women of a lower and more&#xD;
congenial order, to spend my leisure hours in the grossest debauchery&#xD;
and dissipation. But this gentle and pure being, could not brook to&#xD;
be neglected and dishonored by him to whom she had given her&#xD;
young affections, therefore she suddenly left me, and since that, 1&#xD;
have never been able to gain any information whereby I might be&#xD;
enabled again to see her. I will inform you now, what I should have&#xD;
told you before, that I was formerly an English nobleman, and after&#xD;
my injured wife left me, I accompanied my friend here to his planta-&#xD;
tion in America, where I accepted a call to preach to the few inhabi-,&#xD;
tants of the vicinity in which we resided."&#xD;
She said nothing, but motioning Zoraida to follow her, she removed&#xD;
the broad flat stone, and then both of them entered the inner apart-&#xD;
ment, where the Witch, opening the large oaken chest before men-&#xD;
tioned, took from it several articles of dress suitable for her sex and&#xD;
stature of the finest quality, and strictly conforming with the fashions&#xD;
of that period, with which, after divesting herself of her Indian&#xD;
apparel, she proceeded, assisted by Zoraida to array her person. She&#xD;
then removed an Indian mask from her face and neck, showing as she&#xD;
did so, a skin of the most transparent whiteness.&#xD;
" My child," said she to the astonished and amazed Zoraida, "I&#xD;
now declare myself to be your mother, my child, and the time has now&#xD;
come when it is proper that I should explain to you my reason for&#xD;
putting you away from me, to be brought up amongst strangers.&#xD;
"I was married when young to an English nobleman, and lived&#xD;
with him about two years, when I learnt that-, but it matters&#xD;
not; I left him secretly, and by the assistance of friends, was enabled&#xD;
to obtain a passage to America. Always romantic and'wild, and vis-&#xD;
ionary in my thoughts and ideas, and sorrow and trouble having&#xD;
blighted my young hopes and made me sick of the busy world, I re-&#xD;
solved as soon as I arrived here, to live altogether retired from it.&#xD;
Delighting as I did to roam about in the wild woods, enjoying in soli-&#xD;
tude the luxurious melancholy of my own wild thoughts, I heeded&#xD;
not danger beset me, till I was suddenly captured in one of my ram-&#xD;
bles, by a party of Narraganset Indians. I believe that they at first&#xD;
intended to have put ne to death, but my courage and bold bearing&#xD;
excited their admiration, and although they still held me captive, yet I&#xD;
was allowed every other privilege I could wish for. Soon becoming&#xD;
used to their manners and.customs, and having been carried far away&#xD;
from the white settlements, I relinquished for the time all thoughts&#xD;
of escape, and resolving to adapt myself to their ways, I sat myself&#xD;
down with them, and become as one of them.&#xD;
" And now, my dear child, having said all I have to say to you at&#xD;
present; we will join our companions in the other apartments."  So&#xD;

saying, the Witch took outa large golden necklace from the oaken&#xD;
chest, and putting it upon her neck, and telling Zoraida that it was&#xD;
her husband's gift upon her bridal night, she proceed ed, followed by&#xD;
Zoraida, to the outer apartment.&#xD;
No sooner-had she presented herself in her English dress, to the&#xD;
astonished and admiring gaze of the inmates of that apartment, than&#xD;
Herbert, suddenly springing from/ his seat, caught her in his arms,&#xD;
exclaiming:&#xD;
" I know that necklace--oh, my much injured wife, forgive, oh&#xD;
forgive your suffering and repentant husband !"&#xD;
"[have no- doubt," exclaimed she, speaking in a soft, mild tone,&#xD;
" George, that you have suffered sufficiently for your injustice towards&#xD;
me, and I now freely and uidonditionally forgive you. Embrace your&#xD;
daughter," said she, pointiig to Zoraida, and in an instant she was&#xD;
clasped to his paternal $osom.&#xD;
" Zoundsd!"' exclaimed Lord Fitzsimmons, starting up and seizing&#xD;
his friend's hand, and/then in the exuberance of his joy dancing and&#xD;
capering about theapartment, " this is what I like to see. Forget and&#xD;
forgive is my motto. The minister said to-day that in the midst of&#xD;
life we are in death ; that is very true, but I should think that he might&#xD;
now add in the midst of death we are in life. Hurrah ! a man and&#xD;
wife Teunited after a long and painful separatian ! 4 daughter found !&#xD;
ZOds. I can hardly contain myself."&#xD;
- Here Drubbits entered, exclaiming:&#xD;
"Verily I bring glorious-news from the soldiers of Israel; the Lord&#xD;
hath delivered the enemy, even the Indian Philistines into our hands,&#xD;
and many of them are now the captives-of our bows and our spears.&#xD;
Captain George hath sent me to acquaint this worthy coinpanf, that&#xD;
. you can now return in safety to the house, in which I opine that, the&#xD;
accommo atidhs are somewhat better than they are here."&#xD;
Great as the astonishment. and first surprise of Hezekiah Norris&#xD;
and his wife at- the strange denouement that had just taken place,&#xD;
whereby Lord George and his wife, had become reconciled to each&#xD;
other; and Zoraida had found her real parents, but after it had in a&#xD;
.measure 'subsided, they both approached Lady Herbert, and each&#xD;
taking a hand df hers, the old man said :&#xD;
"'My lady, 'I humbly ask your forgiveness for the harsh and bitter&#xD;
words I have spoken to you, and for which, having found how little&#xD;
you deserved them, I now feel heartily sorry."&#xD;
The forgiveness that he asked, having been speedily and cheerfuly&#xD;
granted, -the whole company, headed by Henry and our friend Dru-&#xD;
bits, made the best of their way to Norris's house, where George&#xD;
had made hasty preparations for their reception.&#xD;
