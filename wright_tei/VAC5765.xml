               <p>THE morning rays had dispelled the darkness of night; the genial effulgence of a bright May day broke upon the great city of New York. A mixed population crowded its thoroughfares; the din and bustle of busy life filled the air, and from thousands of chimneys arose the smoke of industry. In a street noted for its grandeur, in a<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC5765-00000005"/> mansion, the home of luxury and fashion, sat Dora Elveston; looking through one of the spacious windows of her apartment, her eyes rested upon the clear blue sky, which imparted comforting softness. Dora was an orphan. Her mother having died before she completed her third year, her recollections of her were faint and childlike. Her father, for whom she cherished the deepest affection, perished at sea a few months previous to the commencement of this narrative, his ship having foundered in a terrible gale. Locked in her apartment, surrounded by every comfort and luxury, Dora had cried and sobbed the morning away. Her heart was sore with pain; her brain reeled, as thoughts of the happy past, gone to return no more, glided by in recollection's train. Poor, dear, kind father, ever indulgent father, sleeping in old ocean's cave; no monument marks thy resting-place, naught but the plashing wave sings thy requiem. Never more should she welcome him from the rough and raging sea; never more would he clasp her in his strong embrace; never more would she be the recipient of his kisses of endearment, his kisses of tender love. Silent forever, forever silent that dear voice which was sweet music to her ears. Merciful God! Why could she not have perished with him? Why could they not have clasped their hands in death, to awaken in Heaven? If she could have wiped the death-sweat from his brow and smoothed his pillow, if she could have caught the faint dying whisper, it would have been a comfort, a support in this hour of affliction. Soothing tears flowed thick and fast, and with them came the remembrances of sunny childhood. Happy days those, which were spent with her dear old auntie (now dead and gone) in the quaint New England village of Milford. Her girlhood's home loomed up; the dear old mansion, with its peaked roof covered with time-worn shingles; the odd windows, with their tiny panes, looking quainter than ever; the great green door, with its huge, funny knocker, to which the village boys tied strings, with which they kept a continual knocking, much to auntie's annoyance. What a polishing this old ornament and its companion piece, the door knob, received every Saturday from Hannah; and Sunday mornings, with what feelings of admiration would auntie gaze upon these family relics. Above all, how white and clean the paint appeared that covered the dear old house. How her childish heart clung to the lofty elms that stood like sentinels each side of the doorway, in which every spring the robin-redbreasts built their nests, and through which with awful solemnity the cold winds whistled in the fall. Her greatest joy was when her kind and loving father came home from his long voyages. In the summer what frolicsome rambles had they taken through woods and dales; what chases across the green fields after yellow, dancing butterflies; what beautiful bouquets of wild flowers had they culled; and when wearied<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC5765-00000006"/> with romping, seeking some shady nook, and reclining upon soft mosses, with what delight had they listened to the peculiar notes of poor Bob White, or the cheery murmur of some romping brook. In winter, when the snow drifted deep around the old homestead, and the wind howled piteously down the broad chimney, causing the wood fire to burn luminously, revealing in its mellow light the ancient dining-room, with its comfortable furniture, which had served several generations, how she had crawled with more than ordinary delight into her father's lap, and nestling her head of golden locks in his soft and flowing beard, listened to his stories of the sea. When the old-fashioned clock, that stood in the corner and ticked so loud, struck nine, how he used to place her upon his back and carry her up to her cosey little chamber at the head of the stairs. She thought of the years she had spent in Madame Duvale's fashionable school; how her associates cared for nothing but parties and dress, and the manner in which they practised all kinds of deceptions to allure brainless fops. She thought of the manner in which she had become an inmate of her uncle's home; how she and her cousin Sadie had made their <foreign xml:lang="FRA">entrée</foreign> in fashionable society; the complete possession of them which it had taken; the fascinations by which it had ensnared them into a condition akin to slavery, from which she was freed by the sad news of her father's death.</p>
               <p>Thus she pondered through her tears, regardless of the passing hours, until a rap, accompanied with a pleading voice begging for admittance, interrupted her reflections. She arose and unlocked the door. The intruder was her cousin Sadie, a personage of medium height, with a well-rounded form and exceedingly graceful and stylish manner. Her Grecian features were finely set off by raven hair and dark, brilliant eyes, while her roguish mouth exhibited teeth of pearly whiteness. Sadie Stranford was a woman of remarkable beauty, and although she had hardly passed her twentieth birthday, her life of show and fashion had dispelled all the warm and natural affections, which add so much to woman's loveliness. Self was the motive of her life—self-glorification. In costly apparel and rare jewels, she sought to be admired, not for her companionship and sympathy, but for her queenly appearance.</p>
               <p>"Why, Dora," said Sadie, as she stepped lazily into the apartment; "still crying? your eyes look horridly; Bosway is to dine with us this evening, you will be a perfect fright. Come, dry up those tears, it is useless to weep so. Your father is better off; it is wicked to mourn in this way. Mother requested me to inform you that we are through lunch, and that Terence is waiting your direction in regard to the table. I promised to meet Harry Van Vickle at Ball &amp; Black's by three this afternoon, to select a philopœna present, and if there is any errand I can do for you, I am at your command."<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC5765-00000007"/> Completing this information, she sauntered out of the room humming a lively air.</p>
               <p>Dora closed the door, and going to the basin, bathed her face with cooling water and cologne. She stood before her dressing-table, and unwound her tresses of golden hair; the mirror reflected a loving, gentle face; the sad look which the features wore added much to their attractiveness; her soft gray eyes possessed an irresistible charm. It could not be called handsome, but it was a winning face. In form she was tall, more commanding than Sadie; her bearing was that of refined grace and culture. After arranging her toilet, she passed downstairs to the dining-room, where she found her aunt. Mrs. Stranford was an exceedingly portly lady. Her features expressed indolence and good-nature. She had evidently led a life of ease and luxury. Fond of dress and show, she desired her family and self to be admired above all others who moved in their favored circle, and had accordingly trained her only child to make subservient to a life of deceptive fashion, all noble instincts of the soul.</p>
               <p>"Dora, I was fearful you were sick, and requested Sadie to ascertain the cause of your detention; why, you have been weeping, how could you do so? you know what you promised Mrs. Dawn. What will she think of you when she returns this evening!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, auntie, I could not help it; I felt so wretched, lonely, and miserable."</p>
               <p>"It seems to me, that if I was a marriageable miss," continued Mrs. Stranford, "I wouldn't cry my eyes out, especially when company was expected to dinner, and such company as the handsome Joseph Bosway. I have requested Sadie to invite Mr. Van Vickle also, and he will accept without a doubt; I hope, Dora, you will strive to appear in your most charming mood."</p>
               <p>Dora made no reply, but ate sparingly of the luncheon. Mrs. Stranford, after giving Terence a few unimportant instructions, proceeded to her room for her afternoon nap.</p>
               <p>Dora was again closeted in her apartment. "So Joseph Bosway is coming here to dine. I must make a little effort to look at least passable. Joseph was my constant escort last winter. Hardly a day has passed since father's death without some kind remembrance from him in the shape of lovely flowers. Joseph is so good a friend, I shall do my best to look and act agreeably."</p>

               <p>SADIE STRANFORD hurried toward Broadway, where she signalled the driver of a stage which was going down-town. On entering, she opened her porte-monnaie, and taking from it the required amount, waited patiently, until a gentleman sitting opposite, who wore a large diamond pin, volunteered to hand up her change; after which she took a position to observe those who were passing on the sidewalk. Sadie recognized several acquaintances; to some she nodded very haughtily, to others graciously, arranging her recognitions in accordance with the position they occupied in her "set." The possessor of a noble heart and seedy coat might be favored with a stiff bow, while a debauched millionaire, with a gaudy watch-chain, would receive the most coquettish and winning smile. Meanwhile, she pondered over the way in which she could manœuvre to obtain a costly present from Harry Van Vickle.</p>
               <p>The stage stopped.... A woman entering, took a seat beside her. Sadie moved, so as to keep her rich apparel from contact with the new-comer's worn garments, while an indignant look flashed from her black eyes. The woman, a poor, careworn creature of toil, did not appear to observe her neighbor's heartless manner. Had Sadie possessed the least spark of compassion, that pale, haggard face would have fanned it into a blaze of sympathy. Those neatly patched garments exhibited dire want, while the sunken cheek and hollow eye proved how near starvation dwelt to this poor lonely one. Such a sight should have pleaded touchingly; its influence should have proved more powerful than the most fluent tongue or the mightiest efforts of a gifted pen. But, Sadie thought too much of self; no impulse could unbar the door, and release her imprisoned heart. Before she had attained maturity, that heart slumbered in selfish apathy. If tears moistened her eyelids (which seldom occurred), they were caused by disappointment, vexation, or affectation.</p>
               <p>By this time the stage was passing Ball &amp; Black's. Sadie made an effort to pull the strap, but the gentleman with the large diamond pin showed his agility by reaching his hand to the same. So suddenly did he apply ten times the necessary force, that he almost pulled the driver from his seat.<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC5765-00000009"/> Sadie, looking at his pin, quickly estimated its value, and thanked him. As she descended from the stage, the gloved hand of Harry Van Vickle was extended to aid her.</p>
               <p>"My dear Miss Stranford, what delayed you? I have been waiting at least an half hour; it was very tedious, I can assure you. I began to think you were hoaxing me. However, I am delighted at your appearance."</p>
               <p>Sadie made no reply to this peculiar nonsense; she appeared pleased, and laughed quite heartily. The usher opened the ponderous door, and they entered Ball &amp; Black's brilliant store; she to use her cunning arts in obtaining a costly present, and he to fulfil, in a foppish manner, a philopœna pledge. Harry Van Vickle, the rich banker's son, had spent a winter in Paris, and acquired a smattering of the French language. He had wandered through the principal cities of Europe; visited various points of attraction, and in a dreaming mood, observed enough to express his views in accordance with the expectations of fashionable society. This peculiar individual had breathed for twenty-five years—I cannot say lived, for he had never soiled his womanly hands with work. His round form and inexpressive face were undeniable proofs of his indolence. His light, sandy hair and scant side-whiskers corresponded with the whiteness of his baby skin, his soft, grayish eyes, and the pettish curl of his upper lip. Fond of a varied toilet, because it pleased the ladies, he appeared in many styles, cut after the English mode. At various times the most costly jewels decorated his person. Being exceedingly light-footed, and graceful in the dance, he was a lion in the circles of fashion.</p>
               <p>"Now, Mr. Van Vickle," remarked Sadie, "you do not suppose that I expect a present; if so, I shall immediately bid you adieu."</p>
               <p>"Why, Miss Stranford," replied Harry Van Vickle, in his most foppish way, "do you imagine that I am not a man of my word, or that I have the least hesitancy in paying what I lost? I shall feel provoked if you do not allow me to liquidate this debt of honor. I say honor, Miss Stranford, because it is in compliance with the bearing and conduct of a gentleman that such obligations should be fulfilled. You must allow me the pleasure of selecting a souvenir."</p>
               <p>"But, Mr. Van Vickle, I fear to permit you," remonstrated Sadie; "you know your failing is generosity; you will choose something enormous in price and princely in appearance. Do not compel me to accept such; I should always feel under obligations to you, and I know you would not like me to entertain such a feeling."</p>
               <p>This was said in such a pleasing way, accompanied with such a pleading, bewitching look, that it caused Harry Van Vickle's heart to beat in responsive tune. He concluded to open his purse to the fullest extent. "It must be a diamond," he<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC5765-00000010"/> muttered; "I could not offer her less. Show us your most brilliant solitaires."</p>
               <p>The clerk, who had been a listener to their conversation, complied with his directions.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Van Vickle, I cannot permit you to squander your money," broke in Sadie.</p>
               <p>"Be quiet, Miss Stranford, I shall do as I choose with my own, and you must consent, or Harry Van Vickle will never know Miss Sadie Stranford."</p>
               <p>"If such is your decree, I shall bear it, although it is very hard." She threw a glance of humble submission, mingled with a slight confusion, which made Harry Van Vickle's heart feel queer again.</p>
               <p>The clerk placed upon the show-case a tray loaded with diamond rings, of various descriptions and sizes. Harry Van Vickle selected, without the least hesitation, one of the largest and most brilliant; then, directing Sadie to unglove her hand, he placed the ring upon her finger. The gem seemed to glisten more radiantly than before. A smile of satisfaction passed over Sadie's face, which the soft and gallant Van Vickle observed with joy.</p>
               <p>"What is the price?" he inquired.</p>
               <p>"Five hundred," replied the clerk.</p>
               <p>"Will you take in payment a check drawn on the banking-house of Van Vickle &amp; Co.?"</p>
               <p>"With pleasure," responded the clerk; "any thing to accommodate the representatives of such a firm."</p>
               <p>"Pen and ink," said Van Vickle, assuming an air of vast importance, which was aided by the compliment his father's firm had just received.</p>
               <p>"Step this way, if you please," said the clerk, making a very humble bow.</p>
               <p>Mr. Van Vickle followed him to the cashier's desk, took from his pocketbook a blank check, which he filled for the required amount; and signed the same with a signature, which extended across its face. The juvenile colored boy again opened the door, and the clerk bowed in a manner which, for its ease, would have won pupils for a dancing-master. Sadie and Van Vickle passed into the street.</p>
               <p>"I am exceedingly weary, Miss Stranford; you will not rebel if we take a coupé." He handed her into one, which opportunely was waiting for a customer, and directed the driver to proceed to Number — Twenty-third Street. They were soon in rapid transit toward Sadie's home.</p>
               <p>"Allow me to thank you, Mr. Van Vickle, for this costly present," said Sadie, as she viewed its bewitching sparkle; "are you aware that you placed it upon the engagement finger?"</p>
               <p>"How singular! how fortunate!" ejaculated Van Vickle; "I hope you will allow it to remain?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly; but people will talk, you know, and what shall I say?"</p>
               <p>"Why, say we are engaged."</p>
               <p>"That would never do; you have not asked my<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC5765-00000011"/> parents; I would not enter into such a compact without their consent."</p>
               <p>"I intend to ask them this very evening."</p>
               <p>"You must not; you have given no indications; it would appear exceedingly strange and hasty—"</p>
               <p>"I do love you, dear, sweet, angelic Sadie. Behold one, long since your slave, one who has been afflicted with the heartache, that trying pain which your dazzling eyes have kindled in so many poor creatures of my sex. Let me breathe a free, a welcome breath of joy; say that I may possess this fair white hand forever; say that I may cherish the hope that at some future date you will condescend to become Mrs. Henry Van Vickle. Do speak one cheering word; do not let me faint with anguish; soothe my poor heart with the balm of love. Call me Henry; call me darling; call me pet."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Van Vickle," cried Sadie, "are you crazed? Stop this nonsense."</p>
               <p>"Call me Henry, only Henry, simply Henry."</p>
               <p>"You have forgotten yourself, Henry. I am calm. I must have time to consider."</p>
               <p>"How long must I suffer this? How long will you require?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot tell—"</p>
               <p>"Then I must await your pleasure; my fate is in your hands." He would have said more, but the coupé stopped in front of the Stranford mansion.</p>
               <p>"Mother," said Sadie, extending her hand, "look at my philopœna present; is it not elegant?"</p>
               <p>"Is it possible, Mr. Van Vickle, that you have honored Sadie so much? Why, it is princely; she does not deserve it."</p>
               <p>"Now, ma, don't talk in that way; it is dreadful mean. Mr. Van Vickle will have a horrid impression of me."</p>
               <p>It was evident Mrs. Stranford was highly pleased with the appearance of matters, and concluded, in her sagacious manner, to let well enough alone. Sadie excused herself and withdrew to arrange for dinner. Entering Dora's apartment, she found her completing her toilette by arranging a spray of heliotrope in her hair.</p>
               <p>"I have a great surprise," said Sadie. "Look, Dora," and she held up her hand and displayed the ring in a boastful manner; "don't you wish you had philopœnaed with Henry Van Vickle?"</p>
               <p>There was a slight rattling of the latch-key, the medallion knob twisted and turned several times before the front door opened to admit Mr. DeWitt Stranford and Joseph Bosway. Mr. Stranford was exceedingly portly; his face was round and full; the top of his head bald, the back and sides being slightly covered with gray hair. His beard was confined to his chin, the remainder of his face being closely shaved; his mouth evinced cunning policy; while his stubby nose gave slight signs of the coloring process; his small twinkling eyes had a sharp look, which the wrinkles in their corners heightened to craftiness; always clad in black, with linen of<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC5765-00000012"/> exquisite whiteness. He applied himself with diligence to his profession, which was law. Now for a look at Joseph Bosway. Tall, graceful, and commanding; neat in dress, and affable in manner; every feature expressed intellect. His large black eyes beamed with a genial kindness, while his dark hair, pushed back from his temples and lofty brow, added to the frankness of his handsome face. He entered the employ of Mr. Stranford at the age of ten; attended night school, studied assiduously, and at the end of fifteen weary years of perseverance, occupied a position of great promise. A year previous to his introduction to the reader, he had been admitted as junior partner in the firm of DeWitt Stranford &amp; Co.</p>
               <p>"Joe, step into the parlor; the girls are anxious to see you; go right in, I will join you presently."</p>
               <p>Joseph Bosway did as directed. The company arose to welcome him. The first eyes that met his were Dora's. In their gaze he read more than ordinary recognition, and it gave him an inward pleasure, which animated him during the entertainment. Dinner having been announced, the party were soon seated to a sumptuous repast. The topics of conversation being foolish, nonsensical, gossip, need no record here. The clock chimed nine; Joseph Bosway had spent a delightful evening, and would have lingered longer, had he not promised Mr. Stranford that he would join him at that hour. Joseph arose, and bidding the company good-night, proceeded to the library.</p>
               <p>After his departure, Dora lingered a short time, pleaded a trivial excuse, and retired. On entering her apartment she drew a heavy sigh, sorrow and grief again settled around her heart, again her utter loneliness forcibly returned. Tears flowed down her cheeks unrestrained.</p>
               <p>Terence had admitted Mrs. Dawn. She entered the parlor, and after various inquiries, withdrew to join Dora. She knocked, and before Dora could reply, entered. Her face, beaming with sympathy and love, sent a ray of hope to Dora's dreary soul.</p>
               <p>"Your eyelids look swollen, my dear; I fear you have been crying," said Mrs. Dawn.</p>
               <p>"I couldn't help it," replied Dora.</p>
               <p>"May I lay my things on your bed?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly; allow me to assist you in their removal."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, that is a great relief; my cloak and furs are rather heavy for this weather." Mrs. Dawn loosened and pushed back her soft black hair intermingled with gray. Dora gazed into her face; its expression wore a sadness of the past; her gentle eyes beamed with a radiant hope, that reached far beyond this vale of tears.</p>
               <p>"I wonder if we can't love each other," said Mrs. Dawn, still pushing back her hair; "I being the oldest, you must be willing to be guided by my wishes, to a certain extent."</p>
               <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC5765-00000013"/>
               <p>"I will, with joy," replied Dora.</p>
               <p>"If you do not object, I will turn out the gas."</p>
               <p>"As you desire," said Dora, being interested by her oddity.</p>
               <p>"There; now draw up the shades."</p>
               <p>Dora obeyed. The round, laughing moon was well up in the sky, its mellow rays entered the apartment, and shed their soft and soothing light over the massive furniture. Mrs. Dawn drew an easy-chair near one of the spacious windows, so that she could look out on the night; then seating herself, she said, with a pleasing smile, "Dora, do you feel too big to be petted? Come, let me hold you."</p>
               <p>Dora sank upon her lap, and softly rested her head upon Mrs. Dawn's shoulder. Her heart was too full for utterance. No one had extended to her such soothing sympathy; no one had ever evinced such tenderness of feeling, except her father. Mrs. Dawn's arms twined gently around her; Dora's sobs of gratitude broke the stillness.</p>
               <p>"Come, my precious pet, don't cry. I am going to love you, to place you in my heart next to poor Edmund."</p>
               <p>"Your kindness makes me weep."</p>
               <p>"My love, I want to whisper comfort; I want to ease your troubled mind. Dry up your tears, that is a good girl, and look up into the canopy of heaven. How quiet, how tranquil, what beautiful serenity. If lasting joy has a home, it must be in yon azure sky. Remember your father no longer in death, but rich in eternal happiness. If I had endless time, and the knowledge of the universe at my command, I should be unable to give the faintest description of his peaceful rest; a sparrow, in his winged flight, could more easily reach the end of space. Forget cruel death; death is only the agent of Him who conquers all. Your father has the treasures of heaven, a crown of radiant life,—would you in your selfishness wish him back? Observe how quiet all is above; now look down to earth. What a change! There placid peace, here despair, disease, and death. Would you wish him back? No, no, I am sure you are contented to leave him with the Master who doeth all things well."</p>
               <p>"Oh! Mrs. Dawn," cried Dora, "you have removed such a weight from my poor heart; how can I repay you?"</p>
               <p>"With your love."</p>
               <p>"May I call you mother?"</p>
               <p>"Call me what you please."</p>
               <p>"My dear mother," said Dora, throwing her arms around Mrs. Dawn's neck, and giving her a childish hug, "I love you fondly."</p>
               <p>A bright smile lit up the countenance of Mrs. Dawn. She folded Dora in a close embrace, and ever after, their hearts beat as one.</p>

               <p>DEWITT STRANFORD, robed in a beautiful wrapper, with his feet adorned by a pair of exquisitely worked slippers, reclined in his easy-chair near a cheerful fire. A volume of smoke, produced by an Havana, occasionally issued from his mouth. Near his chair stood a small table, on which was a silver tray, containing a pitcher of ice-water, several highly polished goblets, and a decanter of old Hennessey brandy. The sides of the room were lined with shelves crowded with valuable books. Mrs. Stranford dozed in a chair, which, in point of comfort, excelled the one occupied by her husband.</p>
               <p>"Well, Joe, you are prompt; draw up that large arm-chair near the fire."</p>
               <p>Joseph seated himself. Mrs. Stranford, being aware of the nature of their interview, uttered several sleepy expressions and withdrew.</p>
               <p>"Joe," said Mr. Stranford, "I propose to have a strictly private talk." Pouring out part of a glass of brandy, he offered it to him, then handed him a Havana. Mr. Stranford monopolized the conversation. "Fifteen years ago, this spring, I visited the institution of charity in which I found you; although a small boy of ten, your aptness won my approval; I desired you, and you became my messenger. It is needless for me to review what has happened since; except that through your own exertions, and my consideration for your welfare, you have risen to a position to which few men of your years ever attain. These years of association have led me to look upon you as a son." Mr. Stranford made a pause, poured again from the decanter into the glasses, and both drank. He then continued: "Yes, Joseph, you are very dear to me; I have observed every change in your life with almost parental interest." A long pause ensued, in which Mr. Stranford lighted a fresh cigar, and then said, rather hesitatingly: "Joseph, you are in love."</p>
               <p>Joseph was somewhat startled. Mr. Stranford, without seeming to notice his agitation, continued:</p>
               <p>"It pleases me exceedingly, my dear boy, to know<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC5765-00000015"/> that the object of your affections is my niece, Dora Elveston."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Mr. Stranford," said Joseph, "how did you discover my secret? I try to conceal it, but I will confess to you, my benefactor, that I have loved Dora for years."</p>
               <p>"She must be yours; it is for this reason I sought this interview. Dora is wealthy. I am the executor of her father's estate; she will receive at least one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. It will be a difficult task for you to win her. She would never consent to become the wife of a man (pardon me, dear Joseph) of unknown origin, unless such an individual portrays indications of future greatness. You can take my word for that. Dora is exceedingly proud; her father was so before her. You must enter politics; you must run for Assemblyman this coming fall. Leave it to me, and do as I direct."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Stranford, this is what I have desired, what my soul has thirsted for; I will obey your instructions, and if lasting gratitude can repay you, mine you will ever possess."</p>
               <p>Shortly after the conversation terminated, Joseph Bosway withdrew. In the hall he met Mr. Van Vickle, preparing to leave. Sadie Stranford ushered them out, then tripped lightly to Dora's room, where she found Mrs. Dawn and Dora, as described in the last chapter.</p>
               <p>"All alone," said Sadie, "here in the moonlight; one would think you were lovers. I have been terribly bored by that silly Van Vickle; however, a five hundred dollar ring will pay for an evening's annoyance."</p>
               <p>An hour after, the heavy tread of Mr. Stranford and the sly tread of Terence were heard on the stairs. Mr. Stranford locked his door; the cat-like step of Terence died away in the attic, and once more the Stranford mansion was hushed in repose. Joseph Bosway and Harry Van Vickle proceeded up Twenty-third Street to Fifth Avenue, where they parted, Van Vickle sauntering up the avenue, reflecting over the effect which his present had produced upon Sadie Stranford. Joseph, quickening his pace, proceeded toward Washington Square. He reflected over the wonderful change which Stranford proposed:</p>
               <p>"Stranford is a strange man, a very strange man; when I first entered his employ, he treated me harshly. In the course of time I became useful; then his manner changed to that of consideration and interest. Of late he has used me graciously, extending to me many hospitalities. How peculiar that he should have observed my love for Dora. He is right; Dora is proud. I must have position, or she will never become my wife."</p>
               <p>A man without an origin must exhibit some indications of prominence, before he should think of such a prize. A man without an origin. Oh! how that remark stung me—sunk into my very heart—<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC5765-00000016"/> although uttered in the most feeling and courteous way. Terrible to enter life without a known parentage; to have one's earliest recollections associated with an institution of charity. To spend the sunny hours of childhood in such a dreary abode. To be pushed into the cold and cruel world, to gain a scanty livelihood before you have shaken off your childish thoughts. After days of weary toil, studying night upon night, by the dim light of a tallow dip, striving to obtain a few treasures from the realms of knowledge. Fighting, ever fighting, to gain a step out of the depths of degradation, to raise one's self to a plane of refinement and ease. That word mother, meaning so much; so sweet and dear to the human race, having no charm. Even a mother's love becomes a vague and senseless sound. To be deprived of a father's guidance and protection, and the joys of a happy home, lit by the faces of brothers and sisters dear. Isn't this enough, without having humanity point at you the finger of disgrace, and breathe into your face the stigma of an unknown parentage? Oh! that mankind could feel the pangs that tear my heart to-night. No more would innocence be branded for others' wrongs.</p>
               <p>By this time Joseph Bosway entered Washington Square, crossed the Park to Fourth Street, ascended the steps of a neat, two-story house, applied his night key, and was soon in the front chamber of the second story. This was Joseph Bosway's home. The ceiling was low, the furniture plain, but an air of comfort and exquisite neatness pervaded the apartment. A hundred or more volumes filled a book-rack which stood in one of the corners; a glance at which revealed the choicest treasures of literature. A bronze clock, which ticked at a famous rate, with a pair of vases, adorned the mantel-piece. Joseph, having removed his hat and coat, took from the centre-table a book in which he was interested, and seating himself in an easy-chair, was soon rapt in its perusal.</p>
               <p>We left Van Vickle sauntering up the avenue, pondering over the effects of his diamond present. He traversed several blocks, stopped, cast a lazy glance at a massive building, on the opposite side of the way, which was brilliantly illuminated. Facing about, he took another but exceedingly wistful glance; placed his hat upon the back of his head; thrust his hands deep into his pockets, and commenced soliloquizing: "Jolly fellows, fine time, something glorious going on; promised governor I would be home early—can't help it, half an hour won't make any difference. I'll just run over and look in, simply to gratify curiosity."</p>
               <p>A few moments more found Mr. Van Vickle in the spacious hall of the club-house. Hardly had he entered, when he was accosted by a tall, slim individual, in the most familiar manner. "Halloo, Van Vickle, how are you, old boy? Glad to see you; good for sore eyes;" at the same time bringing his hand down upon Van Vickle's shoulder with great<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC5765-00000017"/> force. "I say it is good for sore eyes; give us your hand, old softy."</p>
               <p>"Stop, stop, Vinter, you have a grasp like a vice," roared Van Vickle, his face expressing pain; "I will never shake hands with you again."</p>
               <p>"Wont you? queer; d—n queer; chicken-hearted, soft-handed." After another squeeze, which twisted Van Vickle up into a corkscrew shape, he relinquished his grasp. Van Vickle examined his hand, to see if any bones were broken. Being satisfied that in an hour more it would return to its former whiteness, he drew a breath of relief.</p>
               <p>"Just in time, Van Vickle, old boy; fun upstairs; gay party of our boys; Dayles' birthday night; lots of wine; come along;" and Vinter grabbed Van Vickle by the coat collar, and hurried him along at a furious rate up the broad staircase. "No use to say no;—won't do. Got you this time, old chap."</p>
               <p>Van Vickle was perfectly submissive. He knew Vinter was no one to differ with, especially when his breath smelled strong of a beverage distilled from rye.</p>
               <p>"Here we are," cried Vinter, as he opened the door and tugged Van Vickle into a brilliantly lighted room, in which were five other gentlemen of fashion; "here is this old cuss of a Van Vickle; shake hands, fellows; let's all be jolly."</p>
               <p>"Van Vickle," said Dayles, "I hope you were not trying to give us the slip; you won't refuse me the pleasure of joining us."</p>
               <p>"I don't mind spending a short time in such agreeable company."</p>
               <p>"Wine, wine," cried Vinter; "waiter, hurry up that bottle of wine." Before Vinter had ended his vociferous cry for wine, the waiter entered, and placed upon the centre-table a tray filled with glasses, and the desired bottle.</p>
               <p>"Head off, old Bonaparte," said Vinter, trying at the same time to poke the waiter in the ribs with his forefinger.</p>
               <p>Without any parley, the Frenchman severed the cords around the bottle's neck, and pop went the cork, dancing over Van Vickle's head into a remote corner. Van Vickle winced a little.</p>
               <p>"More scared than hurt; next time pop you in the eye," laughed Vinter.</p>
               <p>"Pick your glasses," said Dayles, which they accordingly did.</p>
               <p>"With your permission, gentlemen, I should like to propose a toast," said a large, portly personage, with eyes that blinked and twitched behind a pair of gold spectacles.</p>
               <p>"Let's have it, Winks," said Vinter.</p>
               <p>"Our host," continued Winks, assuming an air of importance; "may his life be like this sparkling wine, ever rollicking and gay."</p>
               <p>"Good," rejoined several voices.</p>
               <p>"May I be allowed to add, if he ever weds may the lady of his choice possess a like versatility of spirit."</p>
               <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC5765-00000018"/>
               <p>"Ha! ha!" broke forth the company, and Vinter shouted, "drink," which they did with a hearty will.</p>
               <p>"Waiter, another bottle of wine," said Dayles.</p>
               <p>The wine was quickly produced; pop went the cork, which danced up to the ceiling and down on Winks' bald head, producing considerable merriment.</p>
               <p>"Never mind, Winks, it will make your hair grow, old covey," shouted Vinter.</p>
               <p>"May I propose this time?" said Van Vickle.</p>
               <p>Dayles nodded an assent.</p>
               <p>"My wishes are, gentlemen, that—that Mr. Dayles' future may be bright and happy, like—like—this beautiful night—and when—and when—this anniversary again returns, may—may—he be—may he be surrounded by such—"</p>
               <p>"Jolly cusses," interrupted Vinter.</p>
               <p>"Yes, may he be surrounded by such a jolly crowd," continued Van Vickle.</p>
               <p>"Drink," shouted Vinter, and all drank again, and the glasses were placed upon the table.</p>
               <p>Van Vickle said, "My turn, gentlemen; waiter, another bottle." This was dispatched, like its predecessors.</p>
               <p>"Waiter," shouted Vinter, "another bottle." So matters continued. Bottle after bottle was called for and dispatched, until Van Vickle began to have some misapprehension in regard to his equilibrium; and continually requested the company to have a care of his clothing, and not spill wine upon him. Winks, perceiving the change affairs were taking, finding a favorable opportunity quietly withdrew.</p>
               <p>"Where's Winks?" roared Vinter.</p>
               <p>"Gone home," replied Van Vickle.</p>
               <p>"Find the sneak," shouted Vinter.</p>
               <p>"Where?" replied Van Vickle.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dayles interrupted: "We must excuse Winks; he is a married man."</p>
               <p>"Winks married!" rejoined Vinter; "thought so; why, the old cuss's eyes winked and blinked so violently I knew he was keeping up a tall thinking behind those goggles. I guess Mrs. Winks will make him wink when he gets home. What a petticoat! Hang his picture."</p>
               <p>"Where?" said Van Vickle, in a husky voice.</p>
               <p>"Did you say where?"</p>
               <p>"I did," responded Van Vickle.</p>
               <p>"When I say where, I mean everywhere," shouted Vinter, at the same time bringing his fists down on the table, causing the glasses to dance and rattle; "yes, sir, I mean everywhere,—all over,—on church steeples, on tombstones, on the trees, on the mountains,—on the—on the deserts,—on the valleys, on everything, man or woman—black or white—that's what I call where. Waiter, another bottle."</p>
               <p>Each succeeding "on" was rendered more forcible, and when he ended with "Waiter, another bottle," his shout could be heard for a block. Three of the party were very peculiar men; two were exceedingly<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC5765-00000019"/> ceedingly quiet, and never failed to put away all the wine the others paid for without the least hesitation or trouble. One had a countenance expressive of melancholy; the face of the other was rather long and lean, portraying a nervous disposition; the last of the three possessed a round laughing face, rather red, probably from the effects of the wine. No one could say anything but that he laughed; when Vinter shouted the loudest and hammered the table, he laughed violently. When Van Vickle assumed an air of importance, and begged the gentlemen to have mercy on his new clothes, and not spill wine over him, convulsions of laughter would almost roll him on the floor. A change came over this jolly little man; his face became grave, very grave. After finishing a glass of wine, he seemed to ponder—still holding the glass—and simply nod to what he previously laughed at. In this state, it would be impossible to decide whether it was some defect in his eyesight or the effects of a powerful imagination which led him to believe the table was in front of him, when in reality it was at his back. However, he released his fingers from the glass, which fell, and striking the floor, was shattered to pieces. He remained motionless, and simply smiled. The melancholy man proposed that he had better take a seat on the sofa, to which he willingly consented.</p>
               <p>"Waiter," shouted Vinter, "more wine; no more bottles—d—n bottles—baskets, baskets."</p>
               <p>"Yes, baskets," joined in Van Vickle. "They think we are tight, Vinter, but we ain't, are we, Vinter? We will show them; conspiracy against us—conspiracy against us, Vinter, but we will show them." Van Vickle, while rendering this speech, was gracefully easing himself, first on one foot, then on the other, with his knees slightly bent.</p>
               <p>"Wine," shouted Vinter; "we will walk on wine, we will swim in wine, we will float on wine, in the clouds, in the soft, airy clouds of love, rejoicing."</p>
               <p>"Look here, Vinter, are you going to let that ninny on the sofa off this way?"</p>
               <p>"He has not drunk his wine the last two rounds," said the man with the long, lank face.</p>
               <p>"I believe I am his substitute," said the melancholy man.</p>
               <p>"None of that," cried Vinter; "every tub on its own bottom, here. Waldy, get up and drink your wine."</p>
               <p>No response from Waldy.</p>
               <p>"None of that skulking," said Vinter, staggering toward him. "Come, get up." No response. Vinter seized him by the coat collar, and hurled him across the room. Poor Waldy's head struck against the corner of the mantel-piece; Dayles picked him up insensible, and carried him back to the sofa. The waiter immediately handed Dayles a piece of ice, with which he bathed Waldy's head. The melancholy man shook his head, and said:</p>
               <p>"Mr. Vinter, you will remember this until your dying day."</p>
               <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC5765-00000020"/>
               <p>This expression, and the serious change of affairs, had a tendency to sober Vinter, and made Van Vickle stand straight. The individual with the long, lank face felt of Waldy's pulse, and said he thought "there wasn't much danger." Dayles felt and expressed serious alarm. Individual with long, lank face felt again, shook his bead, and said, "Pulse is very low." Placing his hand upon Waldy's brow, he immediately withdrew his hand, and shouted:</p>
               <p>"He is dying; the cold damp sweat of death is on his forehead. Where is the doctor? Send for a doctor." Looking around and observing that no one started, without a moment's hesitation, he darted out of the room in search of a physician. Had he or any of the party reflected a moment, they would have perceived that what appeared to be a cold sweat, was nothing more than the effects of the ice. Waldy had perfectly recovered before the doctor came, who pronounced the injury slight. The doctor retired, and the party left for their respective homes, with the exception of Vinter, Van Vickle, the melancholy man, and the long, lank-faced individual, who returned to the wine, and guzzled down glass after glass. Vinter soon became perfectly wild; demanding satisfaction of all in the room—threw off his coat and vest. Van Vickle staggered about after him, shouting whatever Vinter shouted, and likewise threw off his coat.</p>
               <p>"We'll lick them all," said Vinter.</p>
               <p>"We will lick them," hiccoughed Van Vickle.</p>
               <p>"Everybody, somebody, nobody, any one," continued Vinter.</p>
               <p>"We are the boys," croaked Van Vickle, "that can do it; we will fight the whole of creation."</p>
               <p>The last part of this tirade he endeavored to make forcible by a powerful gesture with his left hand, and in doing so lost his balance and tumbled on the floor. The melancholy man aided him to regain his feet, and helped him on with his vest and coat, while the individual with the long, lank face aided Vinter in like manner.</p>
               <p>"More wine," shouted Vinter, "more wine."</p>
               <p>The waiter who had evinced so much alacrity in supplying the previous calls, concluded that discretion was the better part of valor, and was wise enough to perceive that another bottle would have the effect of ruining the carpet and destroying the furniture. Finding that their requests were not acceded to, and that no more wine was forthcoming, the party held a consultation, and concluded that the best place was home. They accordingly proceeded down the broad stairs into the street, the melancholy man aiding Van Vickle, while the individual with the long, lank face took charge of Vinter. After Van Vickle and Vinter had embraced each other several times in front of the club-house, and sworn eternal friendship and lasting love, the party separated. Van Vickle and the melancholy man going up the avenue, while Vinter and the individual<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC5765-00000021"/> dividual with the long, lank face endeavored to proceed down. Vinter was exceedingly boisterous. When any one passed, he would make a fearful effort to grasp him, the result being a struggle between him and the individual with the long, lank face, which terminated by both falling heavily, the individual of the long, lank face underneath. The last desperate struggle occurred immediately after a small specimen of humanity passed.</p>
               <p>"That man insulted me," cried Vinter, at the same time trying to extricate himself from his companion's grasp.</p>
               <p>"No, no, he did not."</p>
               <p>"Let me go, I say," shouted Vinter, extricating his right hand and dealing a powerful blow on the left eye of his over-persistent guide, which had the desired effect. The harmless little man, who heard the cry and threats of Vinter, took alarm and fled. By the time Vinter was in pursuit, he was many blocks up the avenue. On ran Vinter at a terrible rate; about a block after followed his associate. Vinter in his blindness ran into a tree, which partially stunned him and turned him completely around. His companion, perceiving this, stopped, but his stay was rather transient when he saw Vinter rushing at him, maddened with the severe hurt he had received. He fled in dismay; Vinter soon overtook him, and grasping him in his arms threw him, and commenced hammering him at a rate that would soon have deprived him of his senses, had not a guardian of the peace come to his rescue, who, having feelings of compassion, found them lodgings free of charge for the night. Noble philanthropist!</p>
               <p>What a fine picture Van Vickle and the melancholy man presented as they zig-zagged up the avenue. He knew everybody, took off his hat to all who passed; smiled, laughed, muttered to himself something about Sadie Stranford's black eyes; saw the wonderful diamond sparkling in every direction.</p>
               <p>Arriving at the Van Vickle mansion, the melancholy man procured the latch-key from Van Vickle's pocket, opened the door, shoved Van Vickle in, and proceeded on his way home as if nothing had happened.</p>

               <p>THE Stranford mansion was in a great commotion. Its inmates had risen unusually early, and partaken of a slight repast. Two large trunks were being removed from the hall into an express wagon which stood in front of the door; a travelling satchel, and several other articles followed. Mr. Stranford surveyed complacently the transportation, executed by Terence and the express-man. Shortly afterward the baggage wagon disappeared, and its former position was occupied by an elegant equipage bearing the Stranford coat of arms. In the meantime, Mrs. Dawn and Dora, followed by Mrs. Stranford and Sadie, appeared in the hall, where all the usual endearments of parting were exchanged. Mr. Stranford, after hurrying the ladies into the carriage, looked at his watch and discovering that it lacked half an hour of train time, directed Francis to drive rapidly to the Jersey Ferry. The distance was soon traversed. On reaching the ferry they were unexpectedly met by Joseph Bosway, who presented Dora with a choice basket of flowers. Mr. Stranford opened the carriage door and requested Joseph to enter.</p>
               <p>"When you parted with us last evening, I thought you intended to make it your final adieu," said Dora.</p>
               <p>"So I did, but knowing that you were passionately fond of flowers, I presumed a few would be a solace during your journey to Mount Glibe."</p>
               <p>"How kind and considerate," replied Dora.</p>
               <p>On arriving at Jersey City, they drove to the depot, where they alighted in the midst of confusion. No one knew when or where to turn, or which way to go; short, fat men ran against tall, lean men, while heavy weights of solid flesh crushed every diminutive portions of same; illustrating, forcibly, that no two bodies can occupy the same place at the same time. Old ladies looked exceedingly anxious, as though they had fearful apprehensions that something terrible was going to happen; possibly they might lose their sunshades, or veils, or some other superfluity, equally dear, from past associations. Young misses threw contemptuous glances, and pouted, as their precious forms were twisted by the motley crowd into all kinds of ridiculous shapes.</p>
               <p>"Mind the ladies, Joe; I will procure the tickets and attend to the luggage." Mr. Stranford proceeded to the ticket-office, where he found a promiscuous<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC5765-00000023"/> miscuous gathering swaying to and fro. Every man for himself, and each individual trying to thrust his money through an opening.</p>
               <p>"It will never do to wait; I must battle the crowd," thought Mr. Stranford. He pushed into the thickest of the human swell, almost reached the window, when a desperate struggle of the wave sent him back to where he started; this occurred several times. At last he lost his patience, and pulling his hat down over his eyes, he made a strenuous attack upon all who happened to be near. His efforts were triumphant, and he procured the desired tickets; but in so doing, suffered severely from sundry punchings in the ribs by sharp elbows; his carry-all before was terribly pommelled by a little man, who felt highly indignant that such rotundity should push him so unceremoniously away. In the baggage department he found greater confusion; trunks rolled and tumbled in every direction. Immense, heavy, dog-house Saratogas were slammed down on frail poverty's, and frail poverty's were heaped on hat-boxes or old ladies' satchels, generally filled with medicine vials. Baggage-men cursed express-men; express-men cursed baggage-men. Hack-men cursed both baggage-men and express-men. Considering the confusion, Mr. Stranford succeeded in having the baggage checked with remarkable dispatch. Probably the glittering silver quarter which he held in his hand aided him. He found Joseph Bosway and the ladies comfortably seated in the last car. Joseph and Dora were holding a conversation in an undertone. It was clearly discernible that Dora felt sadly at parting with her friend, while Joseph's handsome face reflected deep emotion.</p>
               <p>"Had a dreadful time," said Mr. Stranford, puffing like a porpoise. "Speak quickly, Joe, we haven't a moment to lose; the train is about to start."</p>
               <p>A long, loud whistle, a loosening of the brakes, and a gentle motion began. This alarmed Mr. Stranford; he shook hands hastily, and started for the door; Joseph did likewise, requesting Dora to remember her promise. They stepped off as the train was changing its rate to a more rapid one. Its rumbling noise soon died out in the distance upon the morning air. The depot was almost deserted, and confusion had succumbed to her adversary, order. Mr. Stranford and Joseph entered their carriage, and returned to the city, where they were driven to their office, where we will leave them, with their legal cases, and accompany Mrs. Dawn and Dora to Mount Glibe. Mrs. Dawn evincing a desire to remain quiet, Dora was left to her own thoughts. She examined Joseph's basket of flowers, which mingled its fragrance with the fresh morning air that entered through the open window.</p>
               <p>"If I allow my heart to guide me, I soon shall learn to love him. That would never do; I must consider him in the light of a friend—a dear friend, and nothing more. Like myself, he is motherless<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC5765-00000024"/> and fatherless, but he has no cherished remembrance of a dear father's love, no childlike vision of an angel mother. Oh! that such a noble spirit should receive its life from an unknown source. Heavenly Father, have mercy upon him; smooth his path; give him fortitude and courage to bear the slur which others left him as an heritage. I will keep my promise and write him very often; every line in each letter shall evince a sister's consideration. But no more of this." She resolutely cast her eyes out upon the country, through which the train was running at a maddening speed. First came a broad expanse of swamp grass; then hills and dales, followed by smiling fields covered with their canopy of green. Towering forests, in their new robes of verdure, majestically waved their branches as they glided by. Huge stones scowled by the wayside, and rocky crags from their lofty summits frowned down upon them. Occasionally a silver, romping brook, or a green, sluggish stream added to the varied scene. "How like life," thought Dora; "broad green fields of happiness; then steep hills of trouble; followed by vales of despair. Forests of lofty principles, frowned down upon by rocky crags of temptation; silver, romping brooks of innocent pleasure, laughing joyously near green, sluggish streams of vice." The rumbling car-wheels beat in responsive time to her musing. Chun-ker, chunk-ker, chunk! "Away, away, away we go, life behind and death before us. Open graves will soon be filled, and level plots will be rounded into the mouldering homes of the departed." Such thoughts vibrated through Dora's mind. Unheeded by her, farm-houses chased huge barns, and long files of rail and stone fences glided by. Station after station was reached and passed, but Dora was rapt in her veil of thought, from which Mrs. Dawn aroused her. The brakeman opened the door and shouted Mount Glibe. They were soon seated in a neat country carry-all, which was drawn by a span of beautiful bays. On entering the principal street of Mount Glibe, two rows of tall silver maples reached out their branches across the thoroughfare, and in the gentle breeze of June, seemed to toss Dora a welcome. The quaint aspect of the stores, and of the old-fashioned, comfortable houses which lined at even intervals each side of the way, excited her curiosity and filled her mind with ponderings of the good Old Times, when such abodes were the domiciles in which dwelt the patriot heart of the nation. The Old Stone Church produced its share of wonder. It was situated in the centre of the village green. On its lofty spire stood the emblem of suffering, transmitting in bright effulgence redemption to fallen man. Its arched windows of dark-stained glass appeared like mournful sentinels watching the sleeping dead until the resurrection day. The gravestones, in solemn silence, were marshalled in ranks; cruel army of never-ceasing time, beneath your austere frowns<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC5765-00000025"/> what joys and hopes are laid; upon your never-changing faces we read thy trophies' names; then pause, to think of cheeks now wan and eyes bedimmed with lasting tears. In a short interval the village lay in their rear; and the wild grandeur of the surrounding scenery aroused Dora to ecstasies of delight. Their vehicle was slowly winding up a road which was a succession of steep hills, the summit of each presenting a view more imposing than its predecessor. The final elevation brought them upon the table-land of Mount Glibe. Dora could find no words to describe the emotions which the magnificent grandeur of the view had awakened. Far off to the right was the frowning, perpendicular front of the towering Palisades; at the foot of which gracefully twined (in fantastic shapes, through a green, marshy meadow) a noble river, which reflected from its bosom the soft blue canopy of heaven. On their left were huge hills, covered with dense forests of giant oaks and lofty pines, in the rear of which a stupendous mountain lifted its snow-capped peaks into the summer sky; while clouds of the finest tissue hid portions of its immensity in their white veils of vapor; in the rear was the steep, rugged road over which they had come, with its deep ravines and frightful precipices. In front lay the undulating table-land, with its richly stocked farms and grain-laden fields. Mrs. Dawn had been engaged in a conversation with Abraham, in regard to home matters, during her absence. Abraham was an African by descent. Having served the family for two generations, he was quite a personage about the Dawn Estate.</p>
               <p>"De fust ting that happen, mistuss, was de old brindle cow tried to jump de fence down by de spring one evening; it was milkin time, ye see, mistuss; she had been in de young clover lot unbeknownst to us; 'spose it made her frisky; the critter wouldn't wait for me and the obber kind, but try de jump, and somehow brake one of her horns. Don't worry, mistuss, I took good care of ole Brindle, she is doin' well now. De next trouble was, Phebe went out to hive a swarm of young bees, but de bees wouldn't be hived, and Phebe got presumptious, and all the bees got mad and hived Phebe. Golly, how dat nigger gal did holler!" Here Abraham broke out into uproarious laughter. "I can't help it, mistuss; you would laugh if you had seen de gal rolling like a big pumpkin on de grass; why la, mistuss, she wasn't hurt a bit, only skeart. De next misfortun was, Columbus brake loose from de horse-post in de front of de house, where Master Edmund tied him, and ran up and down all ober de place. Golly! it was hours 'fore we kotched him; he came near sp'iling the flower-garden. Ye see, Jim Attobee skeart him; don't wonder, for dat fishing hat of his would skar any one critter; lucky Columbus was under the saddle, for no vehicle could stood it."</p>
               <p>"How is it that Master Edmund did not come to meet us?"</p>
               <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC5765-00000026"/>
               <p>"Don't know, mistuss."</p>
               <p>"Is he home?"</p>
               <p>"No, mistuss; he went a fishing with Jim Attobee."</p>
               <p>"Did he make any remark about my coming home?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, mistuss; I heard him tell Jim Attobee dat you'se gwine to bring home a petticoat, and he thought he would steer scarce of the house."</p>
               <p>Dora was startled, and somewhat amused by these remarks.</p>
               <p>"I suppose," said Mrs. Dawn, "that Jim Attobee has been the constant companion of Master Edmund during my absence."</p>
               <p>"La, mistuss, all de time, night and day."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to hear it; he exerts a bad influence over Master Edmund."</p>
               <p>By this time they had arrived at a turn in the road which brought them rather abruptly upon an inn. Its large sign-board displayed in glaring letters the inscription, Friendship's Home.</p>
               <p>A shade of pain passed over Mrs. Dawn's face; she turned her head the other way. Dora read aloud, "Friendship's Home," and added, "What a horrid abode for friendship!"</p>
               <p>"You'se right, mistuss," replied Abraham, with a broad grin; "a very funny place. I'se seen men go in dar with best of feelings toward each obber, and in an hour come out in de most awful rage, and commence battering and bruising each obber with fists, full of de love got in dar; dat is funny friendship; Abraham wants none of dat ar sort."</p>
               <p>After this remark, they rode in silence until they came in sight of the Dawn mansion, which stood on a lofty summit of the Glibe table-land. The structure was of granite, and in architecture resembled the old castles of England which were built during the reign of Elizabeth. At one end a massive tower, covered with ivy, loomed up above the roof, and near its top the face of a large clock seemed to add to its antiquity. The edifice was surrounded by an immense park and a dense forest of giant pines stood some distance in its rear. A beautiful lawn, decorated with choice shrubbery, aged evergreens, and massive oaks, undulated gracefully away on all sides. Arriving at the porter's lodge, the gate swung open, and a winding drive soon led them to the entrance of the Dawn homestead. The ponderous doors opened, and several colored servants, with ejaculations of delight, welcomed the mistress's return.</p>

               <p>ABOUT a mile and a half down the road from the Dawn Estate stood the Friendship Inn. It was well located at the fork of two highways, one of which made an abrupt turn around a high bluff. A lovely valley occupied by farms, apparently cared for, stretched in its front. The inn and its out-buildings, which consisted of a dilapidated shed and barn, presented an odd appearance. Time had almost removed from its weather-beaten boards all traces of paint, which gave the rookery an aged look. On each side of a verandah that extended across its front stood two massive oaks. The door and windows were broad and low; tiny panes of glass fitted each window-sash, and shutters that were once green swung in their position by the aid of worn-out hinges. The bar-room, with its low ceiling and sanded floor, was a dingy apartment. A round rail, which ran parallel with the counter's top, protected it from loungers; a set of greasy decanters occupied its rear; a dozen or more of spacious arm-chairs, bearing evidence of hard usage from many jack-knives, with a table to match, completed the furniture.</p>
               <p>Three men lounged on the verandah in chairs that corresponded with their associates of the interior. One of the three was Abel Stickney, the portly proprietor of the Friendship. In his shirt sleeves he reclined, with his feet resting on one of the verandah pillars, as high as his head, and drew leisurely upon a half-consumed cigar. On Abel Stickney's right sat Uncle Bizzle. His silver locks and whitened beard heightened the glow of his bloated features. Being tall and slim, his dilapidated garments hung loosely around him. His shiftless indifference to gentlemanly appearance was aided by dirty stockings and worn-out slippers. Louie Von Idler completed the group. He was a stubby individual of German extraction. True to his name, day after day he idled away and tested the generosity of Stickney's customers. The trio viewed the happy valley without observing its beauties. Unheeded by them, the warbling songsters of the forest poured forth their joyous strains. Uncle Bizzle was the first to break a long silence.</p>
               <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC5765-00000028"/>
               <p>"I tell you, gentlemen, I have seen many changes in this neighborhood during the last forty years. I remember Silas Dawn, Edmund's grandfather. He came from England and located here. Let me see; I think it was in the spring of 1810. He was a fine old gentleman, and looked as handsome as a picture in his knee-breeches and patent-leather shoes, with their large silver buckles. That was long before people thought of railroads. Then grand folks travelled in their own conveyances with outriders. He was exceedingly queer. It was by chance he came here. They say he was completely charmed by the scenery. I shall never forget the day he first passed through the village of Mount Glibe, which was almost as large then as now. My! what a sensation he created. How the villagers did stare. Shortly after he bought the present Dawn Estate, and built that odd-looking mansion, which puzzled the brains, and startled the wits of the country folks for miles around. He took great pleasure in laying out and beautifying the grounds. What were rugged rocks and barren plains on his coming, under his careful supervision assumed the appearance of a fairy land. Strange he should live there seven years all alone, without kindred or friend. After a short illness he died. It was in the depth of winter, on a terrible stormy night, when he expired. I remember how the wind howled; the next morning the snow-drifts were as high as a man's head. His attendants said that when the old clock in the tower struck the midnight hour, he drew his last breath. His funeral was very plain. They buried him in accordance with his own request, near the Old Stone Church. The snow covered the ground to the depth of at least a foot. When the coffin was lowered into the grave it impressed me with a horror that will last until my dying day. Spring returned; rank weeds rollicked in the beds that were once fragrant with flowers. The winding drives and paths were lost in the embrace of tall grasses. The spot that a year previous was a garden of Eden, had now become a desolate waste. The old clock ceased to mark the hour, and moping owls on dark nights hooted their doleful notes from the portals of the tower. Strange stories went the rounds about the place being haunted. Some solemnly declared that an old gentleman walked the grounds after dark. Others avowed that they had passed the place at midnight and heard the old clock strike twelve, and mingled with its tones they distinguished the screams of a dying man. Many of the people avoided going past the place after nightfall. This desolation reigned for over five years, and would have continued until the end of time, if Edmund's father, William Dawn, had not forsaken his friends in England. He came and restored the place to its former condition. Talk about your beautiful women, Abel; you should have seen Mrs. Dawn when they first came to Mount Glibe; she was the most superb creature I ever beheld. A year<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC5765-00000029"/> afterward Edmund was born. When he was about five, his father was thrown from his horse, and received injuries which proved fatal. There was another grave down by the Old Stone Church. Again silence reigned throughout the Dawn Estate; desolation resumed its sway. Four years fled before Mrs. Dawn came back. Edmund must have been nine then.</p>
               <p>"What a bright, happy boy, a perfect little daredevil. He used to ride a white chubby pony over all the steep crags and dangerous slopes that could be found. He often terrified his old tutor by such exploits. I can see the old man now, scowling at a furious rate and shaking his head. I can hear the boy's merry laugh, as he tried something more daring. You know what a passion Edmund has for hunting and fishing. He was fifteen when he evinced his love for these sports. His constant companion was a girl of his own age. Her name was Elsie Olcot; she lived with Aunty Fawn. Some say that Elsie was her grandchild; others have it, that they were not related in any way. We need not trouble ourselves in regard to that. She was bold as a lioness; few boys of her age have half her courage. She was a good match for Edmund. Wherever he led, she followed. It was a happy sight to observe them traversing green fields, roving through forest dells, and climbing steep mountain-sides. I can see them now, he in advance, in his high-top boots, every cord of his muscular frame full of action; she close behind, slender in form, but quick in step, with her golden tresses tossing freely in the breeze. When they fished a stream for trout, she always caught her share. When Edmund missed his game on the wing, her true sight and quick motion generally brought it down. Day after day, for two years, they enjoyed these rural sports. Edmund was compelled to leave home, having to enter the Freshman Class of Old Yale. A great change came over Elsie. She no longer wandered in search of game, she became absorbed in books and exceedingly tidy in her dress. Each year added grace to her womanly charms. All the young sparks for miles around paid homage to her beauty. She treated them all kindly, but nothing more. She had only one thought, and that was for Edmund Dawn. During college vacations, they wandered through fields and forest dells. Many times they were seen in yonder grove, by the murmuring brook, reading some interesting work. Often in the moonlight did they climb to the lofty peak of Mount Glibe. Five years ago, this very month, Elsie disappeared; no trace could be had of her, nor has any one heard of her since. A few weeks after Elsie's departure Aunty Fawn died—they said of a broken heart; and the old cot that sat on yonder hill was deserted. A week after Mrs. Fawn's death, it was destroyed by fire. A month elapsed, and Edmund Dawn returned home, a graduate of Yale. One beautiful morning in<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC5765-00000030"/> July, he rode up and dismounted from his black horse. I shall never forget the bright, joyous expression of his eyes as he said: 'Uncle Bizzle, I have won my sheepskin.' He then turned rather abruptly around, and looked over the valley. 'Why, what has happened to Aunty Fawn's cot?' he exclaimed. 'Burnt down,' I replied. 'Where does Aunty Fawn live?' he asked, with alarm. 'In heaven,' was my answer. He walked the stoop in great agitation for several minutes; then knitting his brow, confronted me with a terrible gaze, and in a choking voice said, 'Where is Elsie Olcot?' I whispered, 'Gone, without a trace, no one knows where.' 'Great God!' he cried, pushing back his hat and wiping his brow, 'I can never endure this.' His face turned pallid as that of a corpse; he drew his soft hat over his eyes, so that it would shade his features, and ever since I have observed that he wears it in that manner. He entered the bar-room, and calling for liquors, drank glass after glass. That evening I saw him home. It was the first time that I had seen him under the influence of drink. Ever since, he has frequented this place, and although young, he is one of us, a poor, bloated wretch!"</p>
               <p>"Ha! the old man is getting sentimental. He is beginning to preach temperance," cried Abel Stickney.</p>
               <p>"I only speak the truth when I say he is one of us—a poor, bloated wretch. We have all passed the bounds, and can never again return to manhood!"</p>
               <p>"I should like to know what my dear old uncle calls manhood—"</p>
               <p>"You can't tantalize me, Abel; I will give you my version. It is a life founded upon the rock of unswerving principle. It is a sphere of purity, which raises one nearer to his God."</p>
               <p>"Why, you old hypocrite of a Methodist parson, where is your white choker and neckcloth?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! you can't jeer me, Abel, and although you act as though your ears were stuffed with cotton, the truth is sure to sink into every heart."</p>
               <p>"I should like to know, Mr. Philosopher, what you call a bloat?"</p>
               <p>"You shall be gratified. A bloat is an individual whose first thought is the glass; whose breath is always tainted with drink; whose intellect is befogged and inactive. Bloats are of two degrees—the developed and the undeveloped. The former illustrates in its features the inward decay, that will bring the latter to its horrid maturity. I hope you understand me."</p>
               <p>"Why of course I do, old man; you allude to yourself."</p>
               <p>"And you also, Abel."</p>
               <p>Two men followed by a large dog came loitering up the road. They were not observed by Stickney and his associates until they commenced ascending the steps of the verandah.</p>
               <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC5765-00000031"/>
               <p>"What luck, boys?" said Uncle Bizzle.</p>
               <p>"Seven small trout," answered Jim Attobee; "a long tramp for such remuneration."</p>
               <p>Attobee and his companion laid their fishing-poles away, under the roof of the verandah, and the party were invited to drink by Attobee's associate, who wore a soft hat well over his eyes. After indulging they returned to the stoop, formed a circle, and then ensued all manner of idle talk. The man who wore the soft hat seated himself at some distance from the others, and the large dog lazily stretched himself at his feet, and wistfully gazed into his master's face.</p>

               <p>EDMUND DAWN remained motionless for hours. His gaze rested upon the distant hills that stood on the opposite side of the happy valley. The glees of Old Yale rang in his ears. His college life unrolled its scroll, and rehearsed his boyish pranks. Elsie Olcot's happy face, with its angelic beauty and loving eyes, loomed on his vision as of yore. Oh! the painful, weary years of useless search; these had crushed the noble inspirations of his young heart; a cankering rust of woe and sadness was his only lot. The shades of night had shut out from his view the happy valley and its vine-clad hills. He arose, and entering the inn drank freely, in hopes that he might drown all thought in apathy.</p>
               <p>Hours fled; the old clock back of the bar<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC5765-00000032"/> sounded ten before Edmund parted from his associates. On reaching the road, the ever-faithful Carlo seized the lappel of his master's coat, and made every exertion to aid him in getting home. Fire-flies flashed across their path; the cat-bird screeched in the thicket; katydids sought to outvie the mountain locust, while croaking swamp frogs produced the bass for the concert of darkness. Edmund Dawn thought of the visitor which his mother had brought to Mount Glibe, young, and probably beautiful; he shrank from the idea of meeting her. He could never return her innocent gaze with his bloodshot eyes. "What feelings of repulsion and horror will possess her when she beholds my bloated face, full of loathsome corruption. She shall never view my fallen condition; Dora Elveston shall never know Edmund Dawn; a few weeks and she is gone, I hope never to return." He entered a side gate of the main entrance, and followed a shady path, which brought him out upon a lawn that surrounded the mansion. He approached the porch, without observing his mother or Dora, bounded up the steps, glided through the spacious hall to the library, and closed the door with a decided slam.</p>
               <p>After tea Mrs. Dawn and Dora had seated themselves upon the porch, and patiently waited for Edmund's coming. When he passed, without a word of welcome, a pang of sorrow shot through his mother's heart, but the darkness concealed her emotion, and Dora would have been unaware of her suffering, if a tear had not fallen on her hand.</p>
               <p>"Don't weep, dear mother; his neglect is compulsory; my presence annoys him; you should not give way to tears, you have every reason for hope. Did you not observe how he covered his face with the brim of his hat? that indicates a keen sense of shame. When this exists, the promptings of manhood still remain."</p>
               <p>These expressions comforted Mrs. Dawn, and strengthened her faith that he might be reclaimed.</p>
               <p>The next morning Edmund was away before breakfast, and the day passed without his presence. Late in the evening his quick step sounded upon the gravel walk. He glided through the hall and closeted himself in the library. Each day came and went as its predecessor. Dora had many hours of leisure, and she explored the old homestead from garret to cellar. Her wonder was greatly excited by the oddity of each apartment. Her curiosity induced her to trespass, and she entered the library, examined the contents of the towering bookcases, viewed with pleasure the landscapes and life-size portraits that decorated the room. With trembling hands, she turned a miniature picture that hung with its face to the wall, and distinguished the beautiful features of a young girl. Returning it to the position in which she found it, she took a general survey of the apartment, and retired with the conviction that a mystery surrounded Edmund Dawn.</p>
               <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC5765-00000033"/>
               <p>Mrs. Dawn and Dora were left wholly to themselves. Each day's enjoyment consisted in pleasant drives, or romantic walks in the great pine forest that stood in the rear of the house. They often culled and arranged flowers in various shapes, and decorated different rooms with them. When other pleasures tired, they sought diversion by perusing some interesting book. A month had receded into the past, and Dora had only seen Edmund's gliding shadow. Appearances indicated that she would return to her home a stranger to him.</p>
               <p>It was a lovely afternoon; Mrs. Dawn and Dora had gone into the pine forest, and after a sauntering stroll, in which they had filled their aprons with wild flowers and fern leaves, they seated themselves upon a moss-covered log, for the purpose of arranging their treasures into bouquets. This task was soon completed, but neither sought to rise; each seemed to be rapt in puzzled thought. By and by Dora exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"If he could be freed from his associates, we might surround him with attentions, that would awaken him to the reality of his condition."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Dora, if you only knew what years I have spent, what efforts I have made to redeem him, to shield and protect him from these vile contaminators, you would not think there was any prospect of changing his life."</p>
               <p>"Remember, dear mother, while there is life there is hope. I only wish I knew him, I should never cease to watch and plead with him. No sister could evince more consideration or interest than I would. Why should he so determinedly avoid me? I have a great mind to beset him, and make him recognize me. I should like to mount Chubby tomorrow morning, and ride to the Friendship. It would be impossible for him to escape me. I should request his aid to dismount, and after securing the horse, inform him that I came to spend the day with him and his associates."</p>
               <p>"That would never do, Dora; Edmund is strange—he is not himself; you would exasperate him, and your good intentions would meet with a cruel rebuff."</p>
               <p>"Oh, how can we save him?" cried Dora. "How can we awaken him to the trueness of life?"</p>
               <p>"By prayer and patience; hoping that God will send the opportunity."</p>
               <p>Dora sought to push no further a conversation which she knew was painful to Mrs. Dawn. They returned home with sad hearts, and being more than ordinarily fatigued, retired an hour after tea.</p>
               <p>That evening Edmund came home unusually early. Uncle Bizzle and Jim Attobee accompanied him to the entrance. A little after midnight Abraham knocked on her door, and arousing her, informed Mrs. Dawn that Edmund desired to see her. She arose, and throwing a dressing-wrapper around her, proceeded to his apartment. Shortly after Dora heard Abraham's step pass through the hall,<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC5765-00000034"/> out the back door, and around the house to the stable. A few moments of silence elapsed, then the clattering of a horse's hoofs broke the stillness, and died out in the distance. Dora becoming alarmed, arose, dressed, went down to the parlor, where she waited patiently for new developments. More than an hour had passed, when the night's stillness was again broken by the rumbling of a chaise. Nearer and nearer the sound approached, until it ceased in front of the house. Shortly afterward Abraham entered, followed by Doctor Miller. They disappeared in Edmund's chamber. A half hour of suspense followed before the doctor, Mrs. Dawn, and Abraham came out.</p>
               <p>"Obey my instructions implicitly," said Doctor Miller; "watch him closely, and all will be well."</p>
               <p>He climbed into his chaise, nodded good-night, and his vehicle was soon lost in the darkness. Mrs. Dawn was about returning to Edmund, when Dora beckoned to her from the parlor. As she approached, Dora whispered:</p>
               <p>"Do let me aid you to-night; don't refuse, I can be of great service."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dawn hesitated, but Dora continued to plead with so much feeling, that she consented. They glided into the sick-room. The light was placed in the broad fireplace, and shaded by a large book, so that its rays could not disturb the sleeper. They seated themselves near the bed. Edmund lay upon his back in a restless sleep; a hot flush covered his bloated face. His long black hair was matted in ringlets, and his half-closed eyes added to the hideousness of his expression, which filled Dora with horror. A deep scowl knit his brow, a groan occasionally escaped his lips. At length his features relaxed; a smile played around his mouth; he murmured that soft music charmed him. Then his breath came thick and fast; a shade of pain settled over his face; again, with set jaws, he ground his teeth. He raised his arms with clenched fists, as if contending with a deadly foe. Then followed a few short moments of repose. Then he sat upright in bed; his crazed laugh broke the silence of the room.</p>
               <p>"See, see," he cried, with his arms extended; "she leaps from crag to crag! She is on the highest pinnacle of Mount Glibe! She staggers—she reels.—Help, help; Great God! She falls. No, no; she clings to a rocky jag. The mountain thorns tear my flesh. I am almost there. Thank God! I can reach her now. Ah! I have her in my strong embrace; she is saved! No, no. I am growing weak. There, there; tighter, tighter in my grasp; more courage, more nerve. I see—I see her mangled corpse. She is lost! She is lost! Her spirit haunts me. Snakes curl from her eyes to sting me; the flames of hell leap from her mouth and scorch me; take her away!" he screamed, crouching in a far corner of the bed, as if to evade her grasp. His eyes glared from their very sockets; fear had placed her sign on<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC5765-00000035"/> every feature of his now pallid face; shriek after shriek rent the air; his hands passed through and clutched his dishevelled hair. The paroxysm passed away, and he fell back on his pillow, like one in a swoon. Towards evening of the following day, when the medicine having soothed his delirium, he awoke from a quiet sleep, consciousness had returned. A soft hand gently pressed his swollen brow. His eyes opened, and met the tender gaze of Dora's smiling eyes.</p>
               <p>"I resolved," he uttered, "that you should never look upon my fallen condition. Vain resolve. I am as weak and powerless as a babe. 'Man proposes, but God disposes.'"</p>
               <p>"If my presence annoys you, I will go," said Dora, softly; "but I should like to nurse you as a kind sister would a dear brother."</p>
               <p>He gazed inquiringly into her face. Her sympathy had awakened a tender emotion in his breast, and he cheerfully assented to her remaining.</p>
               <p>It was weeks before Edmund regained his former strength. Dora felt that this was the opportunity for which they had prayed. She devoted herself wholly to him, and exerted herself in every way to awaken his manhood's reason. She searched the library for the choicest literary gems, and read to him with all her powers of feeling and eloquence. Her exertions were fruitful. His proud spirit soon commenced to feel the inspiring purity of her influence. He neglected the Friendship and his old associates. He occupied his mornings by diligently reviewing his college studies; the afternoons and evenings were spent in his mother's and Dora's society. Happiness crept into the old abode, and joy into the mother's heart.</p>

               <p>WHAT ails you, Abel, this morning?" said Uncle Bizzle.</p>
               <p>"Don't bother me; I have a toothache."</p>
               <p>"I suppose it is the same old tooth that always annoys you when you feel displeased."</p>
               <p>"Maybe it is and maybe it isn't, old man."</p>
               <p>"I wonder if temperance hasn't something to do with it?"</p>
               <p>"Well, what if it does aggravate me, to think that matters in Mount Glibe have come to such a pass that the old tea-guzzlers can meet and defame my business. I wish I had the power, I would soon disperse their gathering in the Old Stone Church tonight."</p>
               <p>"If wishes were horses, Abel, beggars would ride."</p>
               <p>"Why you don't say so; how bright the aged boy is getting in his young days!"</p>
               <p>"It is your fire-water that makes me so, daddy."</p>
               <p>"Don't talk about my fire-water, as you call it; it's as good as you or anybody can find in this country."</p>
               <p>"Do you think that exalts it to the standard which it bears?"</p>
               <p>"You are trying to be awful funny, arn't you? but I can't see where it comes in."</p>
               <p>"Why in the toothache, and the temperance meeting, Abel."</p>
               <p>"Come, stop this cross-firing, Old Chap; you touch me on a sore point. If you were in my place you would growl like an old bear. What right have they to interfere with other folks' business? I don't see how it concerns them what other people do. I hate these temperance croakers, a nice kettle of fish they would make of it if they had their way. Isn't this a free country? hasn't every one a right to do as he pleases? Isn't that what our forefather, George Washington, fought for? Here these fanatics are trying to deprive us of the liberty which he bequeathed us. Great Christianity, to talk against a poor, honest man's living, and try to take away his bread. It shouldn't be allowed; there ought to be a law preventing such meetings."</p>
               <p>"You may be right; you may be wrong," said Uncle Bizzle.</p>
               <p>"I am right, of course I am right, and I could prove it to them, if I had the opportunity."</p>
               <p>"But you will never get the chance," replied Uncle Bizzle, rubbing his bony hands.</p>
               <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC5765-00000037"/>
               <p>"Won't I? you see if I don't."</p>
               <p>"What could you say to a gathering?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! I don't propose to speak; I have another to do it for me."</p>
               <p>"That is good, but I don't perceive where you can find a substitute in these parts."</p>
               <p>"I have a plan; wait until to-night. You will see and hear something that will puzzle your old brain."</p>
               <p>"Jim, ain't you a going to attend to what we talked about last night?"</p>
               <p>"That's what I have been pondering over all the morning; it will be a difficult job," replied Jim Attobee.</p>
               <p>"I thought you had such influence."</p>
               <p>"So I have; but you know he is a rare crooked stick; besides, I don't like to go to the house, I don't fancy the way his mother looks."</p>
               <p>"If you don't bring him, he never will come; it is over four weeks since he entered that door; if you want me to comply with my part of the promise, you must fulfil yours."</p>
               <p>"I intend to."</p>
               <p>"That is a nice way to talk."</p>
               <p>"Now don't you worry, and get into a sweat," said Jim.</p>
               <p>That afternoon Jim Attobee stood in front of the main entrance to the Dawn Estate. After considerable hesitation he entered, and sneaked up the thick shaded path which came out on the lawn near the house. His hand rested upon the bell-knob, but his fortitude forsook him. Willingly would he have skulked away had not his promise to Abel Stickney involved a selfish end.</p>
               <p>Molly rapped at the library door, and informed Edmund that James Attobee desired to see him.</p>
               <p>"Presently," was the reply.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dawn and Dora were out in the flower-garden, which was in the rear, between the pine forest and the house. Attobee, discovering that he had a clear course, had regained courage when he heard Edmund's step approaching.</p>
               <p>"Why, Edmund, my dear friend, what has kept you from your old associates? Oh! I see; a little woman-struck. But you should not forsake us altogether. Come, get your hat, we will take a walk around by the old mill."</p>
               <p>A thoughtful expression came over Edmund's face. After some minutes he said:</p>
               <p>"I have promised to accompany my mother and Miss Elveston to the lecture this evening."</p>
               <p>"You will be back long before it is time to go. I intend to go also. Come, Edmund, for old acquaintance sake, grant this favor."</p>
               <p>Edmund yielded, and shortly after they sauntered down the winding drive, followed by Carlo. A pleasant walk through meadow and dale brought them to the bridge, which spanned the main brook that fed the old mill-pond. They paused here. Jim Attobee took from his pocket an old rusty<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC5765-00000038"/> knife, and commenced cutting large scallops into the rail of the bridge. He was baffled and puzzled; he began to fear that his boasted influence was of no avail. Something had changed Edmund.</p>
               <p>"I want to show you the trout I caught yesterday; he is a real three-pounder; Stickney is keeping him on ice, expressly for your benefit. He says the sight of it will please Dawn more than new territory would delight a king." Attobee then went into a long description of the difficulty he had in taking his prize.</p>
               <p>Edmund's eyes rested upon the smooth water of the murmuring brook. He listened with much interest to the narrative; of all sports, trout-fishing was his favorite. It possessed for him a charm which amounted to fascination. Attobee was aware of the interest he had awakened, and after some persuasion, he prevailed upon Edmund to accompany him to the "Friendship" for the purpose of seeing the much-admired trout.</p>
               <p>That night a drunken crowd filled the Friendship Inn. Abel Stickney had forgotten his meanness, and through his hospitality rum flowed like water. The frequenters of the old rookery were jubilant, for Dawn had returned; Abel Stickney watched with glowing satisfaction the demon growing in his eye. "Now or never," he thought.</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen," he cried, so that his voice could be heard over the gross laugh and obscene jokes of the company; "I mean friends," he continued, after order had been established. "You are all aware that the temperance croakers are holding a meeting down in the Old Stone Church. It is against my living; they denounce us as outcasts; as a nuisance in the community; they are trying to take our rights away. I propose we break this meeting up."</p>
               <p>"That would be rather rash," said Uncle Bizzle.</p>
               <p>"Then I offer as a substitute, that we go down there in mass, and have Dawn vindicate our cause. He can do it. He has the ability. What do you say, Dawn?"</p>
               <p>"I am afraid you overrate me."</p>
               <p>"No, we don't; will you do it?" cried several voices.</p>
               <p>"I will try," replied Edmund.</p>
               <p>"That is a bargain; fall in, fellows. We will show these cold-water bummers that they can't have it all their own way," shouted Stickney.</p>
               <p>The Friendship was soon deserted, and the drunken mob was on its way to the Old Stone Church, making night hideous with its wild shouts.</p>
               <p>"What a triumph we will have," said Attobee to Stickney, as they neared the church. "Think how Mrs. Dawn and her busybody of a visitor will feel when they see Edmund in an intoxicated state, trying to address the gathering. I reckon they will learn in the future not to meddle with things that don't concern them. If it hadn't been for them and Dr. Miller, there wouldn't have been any temperance folderol."</p>
               <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC5765-00000039"/>
               <p>"Are you sure that Edmund will have never enough?"</p>
               <p>"You leave him alone for that."</p>
               <p>By this time the crowd were stumbling boisterously up the steps of the church. The body of the edifice being filled, they were compelled to remain standing. Soon after their arrival, the lecturer concluded.</p>
               <p>"Now, Dawn, now is your time; be a man and show the people of Mount Glibe what stuff you are made of," said Abel Stickney.</p>
               <p>Edmund went boldly up the main aisle, followed by Carlo. His hat was drawn well over his face. His step was firm. Without the least hesitation, he mounted the rostrum. Every one was startled by his sudden appearance. None were more shocked or alarmed than Mrs. Dawn and Dora. Removing his hat, he calmly gazed upon the assembly, while Carlo crouched at his feet. "My!" thought Uncle Bizzle, "he looks like a lion at bay." Mrs. Dawn covered her face with her hands to hide her feelings of shame; Dora dropped her head and breathed a <choice>
                     <sic>fevent</sic>
                     <corr>fervent</corr>
                  </choice> prayer.</p>
               <p>"Ever forgive," rang out in a clear, loud voice, that resounded through the church; "Ever forgive the poor, bloated wretches, that drive happiness from your homes. Ever forgive those who have fallen victims to cursed rum. You all know me—Edmund Dawn—drunken Edmund Dawn; wasted in body and weak in mind. Many of you remember ber me, a bright, happy, romping boy. Look at the change, the awful change! What did it? Rum! What blighted all my energies? Rum! What has made me this loathsome creature? Rum! Young man, have a care how you tamper with the deluding glass! Don't touch it; leave it alone. For God's sake, for your own sake, and for poor Edmund Dawn's sake, keep your hands from it. For, once within its grasp, it will rob you of all joy. Life and health will soon bear their yoke of pain. Day after day its claws of anguish will tear hope from your soul. Before death seals you for the tomb, its brush of sin will paint your features as the devil's own. Under its influence life becomes a vacant dream—existence loses its alluring smile. For years I have wrung my mother's heart; the child which she nurtured in kindness, in manhood becomes her bane. The heart that should overflow with gratitude pours forth 'streams of affliction.' The existence that should be given to her comfort, as recompense for her fostering care, is lost in the mist of debauchery. Hell reaches out her hand beyond that of death and claims its captive. Every noble instinct becomes petrified. The billows of time beat unheeded against the coast of mortality; their warning fills the air of life, their music of flight becomes monotony to the ear; the soul slumbers in its case of perishing clay, until death awakens it in the tortures of everlasting destruction.<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC5765-00000040"/> My friends, pity me! pity the hopeless condition of Edmund Dawn."</p>
               <p>Silence reigned throughout the church; tears moistened every eye. He passed down the aisle and disappeared as strangely as he came.</p>
               <p>Abel Stickney and his associates retired soon after they discovered the purport of Edmund's remarks. They had returned to the Friendship and were indulging in base curses against his treachery. A quick foot neared the inn, and bounded up the steps. There in their midst stood Edmund, confronting them with angry scowl, his gray eyes flashing forth terror.</p>
               <p>"I have come for the last time," he said, speaking with great determination, and rather quickly. "Beware, James Attobee and Abel Stickney, how you, in the future, tamper with Edmund Dawn."</p>
               <p>Before the crowd had recovered from the shock of his presence, he had gone. The night was calm; not a leaf rustled; the stars glimmered from a clear azure sky; a crescent moon added faintly to their dim light. Edmund paused on the lawn in front of the tower. Taking off his hat, he dropped upon his knees, and turned his face heavenward; for the first time since he in childhood had knelt by his mother's knee, he prayed for aid and strength. In the calm, still night, in its soft starlight, it arose as incense before the Seat of Mercy, where angels caught its theme and sang with joy to the Redeemer King. Unconscious that he was observed, he arose and entered tered the house. Two dark forms in one of the Gothic windows of the tower mingled their tears of joy. That night happiness drove from the Dawn Estate the gloomy harbingers of grief; and the coming morn awoke the household with rays hopeful of brighter days.</p>

               <p>DORA reined up her horse by the side of a deep, jagged ravine. Edmund did likewise.</p>
               <p>"It pains me to hear you say you can't refrain; you have not sunk all the hopes of manhood; you are far above the lowest depths of despair; as high above the miserable, lost condition of the confirmed drunkard, as this hill-top is above the marshy meadow at its base. You have no half way, Edmund Dawn. To-day you have a firm foothold on the mountain of life. You must either go upward or downward. Which shall it be?" she continued, looking him in the face earnestly; "up to spheres of ennoblement and spiritual grandeur, or down the foreboding precipice, with its jagged rocks of pain, to the mire of irredeemable degradation. This analogy may appear strange, but, nevertheless, it is true. You cannot nurse your most cursed enemy in your closet and expect to resist his outward allurements. You must be wholly and solely temperate, or you will soon seek the Friendship and its low contaminations."</p>
               <p>"I intend to resist by degrees, Miss Elveston."</p>
               <p>"Ah! that is your mistake, Edmund Dawn. You propose to fight your most powerful foe with a weak intention. You will fail; thousands have failed before. Gradualism never conquers bad habits. Even the devil laughs at such miserable warfare. They say that hell is paved with good intentions; but you can rest assured that the system of resisting bad inclinations by degrees fills it. There is no easy manner of meeting your adversary. In the battle of life! No compromise! If vanquished, who shall receive mercy or forgiveness? Buckle on your burnished armor of principle; cover your head with the helmet of reason, and in the strength of your will subdue this demon of your existence."</p>
               <p>"Your illustrations are powerful, Miss Elveston. The knight of your fancy outvies Ivanhoe, and is worthy of a lady more beautiful than the fair Rowena. In her excitement, I fear my exhorter has<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC5765-00000042"/> forgotten the miserable weakness of the individual she seeks to elevate."</p>
               <p>"We are all weak when confronted by sin, but in our weakness we have the victory through prayer. Excuse my enthusiastic manner, and if my expressions are harsh, forgive them. I only intended to be sisterly," she added, with a smile.</p>
               <p>"Your consideration and kindness have made me your debtor, and this effort to convince me of my error has added largely to the gratitude which I owe."</p>
               <p>She drew up her reins, with a jaunty toss of her head, and said:</p>
               <p>"I wish I could make you feel the importance of my assertions."</p>
               <p>"We will talk about that some other time," he replied, laughingly. "I believe in letting destiny hang around these old mountains for a while, and enjoying our ride. Which way? Down by the mill, or across the plain?"</p>
               <p>"Down by the old mill," said Dora, putting her horse into a gallop.</p>
               <p>They rode at a rapid gait for a quarter of a mile, then allowed their horses to subside into a walk.</p>
               <p>Late that evening, Edmund Dawn was seated alone in the library. Unobserved by him, the hands of the clock had crawled around to the first hour of morning. A terrible strife had been raging in his soul. The force of habit made every fibre of his flesh quake with desire. Each moment weakened ened his determination and lent strength to the demon within. The longer he pondered, the more powerful became the temptation to quaff the glass that could soothe his shattered nerves. The gnawing, craving appetite mounted in his throat and held his swollen tongue almost powerless. His brain reeled; a delirium seized him.</p>
               <p>"I must have drink; I cannot endure this torture. Life is worse than hell." A few minutes after he carried a glass of the damnable beverage to his lips. An impulse seized him. Dora's exhortation came forcibly to him now. "Gradualism? the devil laughs at that. Resisting bad habits by degrees fills hell. If vanquished, who shall receive mercy or forgiveness? Buckle on your armor, Edmund Dawn; cover your head with the helmet of reason; and in the strength of your will, subdue this demon of your existence." He threw the glass and its contents on the floor; and clasping his hands, walked the room shivering with agitation, suppressed groans of anguish occasionally escaping his lip. Large drops of sweat stood on his brow. "Conquer now, or fill a drunkard's grave. Now and forever make this desire subservient to self-control. Years have I wandered in a labyrinth of indifference. Dora's illustration is apt; a deep ravine intercepts my progress. This very night I stand trembling upon its verge. Shall I leap into its depths of despair? A hand is extended, shall I clasp it? Oh! prayer, to thee I cling; each fervent<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC5765-00000043"/> vent breath brings resistance. Oh? Thou who hast redeemed mankind, help! Oh! Christ, help! save me from this fearful eternity!" He seated himself, and wrote in a firm hand:</p>

               <p>A week after this conflict Mrs. Dawn and Dora, on retiring, were astonished by finding in the centre of their bed a huge basket laden with broken glass, and on the pillows lay two communications, one for each of them. Mrs. Dawn breaking hers open, read aloud:</p>
               <p>"MY DARLING MOTHER,—Please find inclosed a document, that, with God's assistance, will make a man again of your poor fallen son; and through each declining year of your life, by its aid, he will fold around you an arm of protection, and smooth, with a hand of gratitude, the face of frowning care. Ever forgive the past. Let the prospect of a bright future throw its mantle of joy over all remembrances of sorrow. Pray for your loving son, Edmund."</p>
               <p>She finished with a choked voice, and wept grateful tears of joy.</p>
               <p>"Now for the contents of mine," exclaimed Dora, her face beaming with smiles.</p>

                           <p>"Dear Friend,—For the interest you have evinced in my welfare, and the powerful influence which you have exerted in arousing me from the sleep of drunkardness, I bequeath to your keeping this basket, which contains the fragments of the decanters and bottles that once protected my deadliest enemy. I sincerely hope that your good judgment will consign them to a place fully adapted to their position of degradation. Accept my thanks for your sisterly kindness, and believe me,</p>

               <p>They were amused by the oddity of the last epistle, and looked laughingly into each other's eyes. Mrs. Dawn drew Dora to her, and kissed her lovingly many times.</p>
               <p>"How can I ever repay you for this victory of Edmund's?"</p>
               <p>"Please don't allude to it," said Dora. "If I did anything it was selfishness that actuated me. If you knew how my poor heart rallied from its grief when your sweet words and smiles of sympathy kissed its bruised surface. If you knew how wearily it lay down, like a poor bleeding lamb, in the quiet pastures of your love, you would discern<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC5765-00000044"/> the motive that interested me in Edmund's welfare."</p>
               <p>The next day Dora knocked at the library door, and requested Edmund to listen to a proposition which she had to make, concerning her charge, the basket of broken glass.</p>
               <p>"Promise me you won't be cynical to what I propose."</p>
               <p>"I shall endeavor to receive it in its proper light, it will appear so much the better," laughed Edmund.</p>
               <p>"I desire you to aid me in burying the basket and its contents beneath my favorite rose-bush."</p>
               <p>"With pleasure will I comply with your request, Miss Elveston."</p>
               <p>"And furthermore," continued Dora, "I want it to remain a secret between us."</p>
               <p>"I must confess your idea is rather strange, but I will do as you wish."</p>
               <p>In the afternoon Mrs. Dawn went to the village of Mount Glibe to make sundry purchases. During her absence Edmund and Dora buried the basket and its contents beneath her favorite bush, which stood in the centre bed of the flower-garden.</p>
               <p>"There," said Dora, after the work had been completed, "I think that is the most befitting place I could find for such fragments," looking at Edmund with a bewitching sparkle in her eye. "Your curiosity would like to know my motive. It shall be gratified. In the future, when its buds burst into beautiful flowers, they will remind me of the noble instincts of your heart, that are germinating into lofty principles, and such thoughts will bring me hope, that the desire to quaff the poison that found a home in the broken mass is buried equally deep by fortitude and resolution." Plucking a rose from the bush, she continued: "I present this as a token of my friendship and the pleasure your manliness has caused me." She paused, and dropped her eyes to the ground.</p>
               <p>Edmund took the rose and seized her hand: "In the future let the twin sisters of this lovely token be a symbol that Dora Elveston is pleased with the battle of life, waged by her knight, Edmund Dawn."</p>

               <p>IT was late in the afternoon. The day had been unusually close. Mr. Stranford and Joseph were seated in their private office. The former, in his shirt-sleeves, with his wilted collar unbuttoned, had been exceedingly quiet during the day; the intensity of the heat had made him stationary for hours; even the waving of his palm-leaf fan had become irksome.</p>
               <p>"Oh! my rotundity," he muttered; "would that I were the sprightly youth of eight-and-twenty; those were the days that were not affected by the extremes of the weather. I can't imagine why some people go into such ecstasies over summer. For my part, I would much rather be a Laplander, or at the North Pole itself. Give me Old Winter, with his biting frost and bracing air. But this kind of soliloquizing is absurdity; we have to take it as it comes—the wet and the dry, the heat and the cold." A slight sea-breeze floated in through the open window, and its resuscitating power revived Mr. Stranford's drooping spirits.</p>
               <p>"If I were you," said Joseph Bosway, "I would join Mrs. Stranford and Sadie. The waters of Saratoga are very efficacious, especially in such sultry weather; you require the change. Our business is light, and the duties will not be arduous. If anything of importance should transpire requiring your presence, I can notify you by telegraph."</p>
               <p>"I agree with you, Joseph, and shall make my arrangements for departure early next week."</p>
               <p>"There is no necessity for your delaying until then. I can attend to the preparing of the papers in the suit of Van Vickle against Botter. The best thing you can do is to go home and pack your bag, take the morning train to-morrow, and arrive in Saratoga before the heat of the day."</p>
               <p>Mr. Stranford was confident that Joseph was equally able as himself in opening and constructing any papers which would be required for the above-mentioned suit, and this being really his only detention, he was easily induced to accept Joseph's offer. After a long interview, in regard to the principal bearings of the case, and a lengthy catalogue of various instructions, he bid Joseph farewell, and<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC5765-00000046"/> started for home to prepare for his departure. He summoned Terence to the library, and after instructing him in the way, he desired his baggage to be packed; he removed his coat, and drew up his easy-chair by the open window. The elder Van Vickle dropped in and spent the evening with Mr. Stranford. Their conversation at first alluded to business topics. Losses and profits, bank shares, and railroad securities enlisted their attention; home matters were also discussed in a bachelor tone.</p>
               <p>"By the bye, Stranford, did you see the Saratoga letter in the <title>Herald</title> this morning? It represents your daughter as the queen of the season; her beauty and charms are extolled as those of a goddess."</p>
               <p>"The ridiculous absurdity of some brainless correspondent," replied Mr. Stranford, concealing his feelings of gratification and paternal joy.</p>
               <p>"You are wrong, Stranford; Sadie is equal to the description. The young bloods will vindicate the veracity of the correspondent's letter. My son Henry seems to have a weakness that way also; I don't blame him, for if I was single, as old as I am, I should be taken in the same quarter."</p>
               <p>"I don't doubt it," said Stranford, calmly. "Old fogies make better jumping-jacks than young sparks."</p>
               <p>"Have it your own way. It don't make any difference; old fogies and young sparks are equally willing to do homage to beauty; rich and poor, wise and simple, are bewitched by women's charms. It is becoming of you to assume a blindness to Sadie's triumphs, but your father's heart feels its own pulsations of pride. If I am fogyish, Stranford, I know that no one could love an only child more than you."</p>
               <p>"Your discrimination is wonderful, Van Vickle. Do you exert it to such an extent in your business transactions?"</p>
               <p>"If I didn't, Van Vickle &amp; Co. would soon be counted in the past. Why, Stranford, no banker could keep from bankruptcy without it. You have no conception of the schemers and would-be defaulters that haunt us. Lawyers have their discernment of men, but it differs entirely from the scrutiny of a financier. You obtain your judgment of an individual by cross-questioning; we form ours at a glance."</p>
               <p>"Sometimes your glances prove exceedingly costly, and your legal friends profit by your hasty mistakes."</p>
               <p>"Well, what if they do? It would prove a poor livelihood for your profession, if no one made mistakes. What we lose you gain."</p>
               <p>At this part of the conversation Mr. Van Vickle arose, and wishing his friend a safe journey, departed. Mr. Stranford proceeded to his bed-chamber, where he found Terence, who had just completed the packing of his baggage.</p>
               <p>"I am going to Saratoga, Terence, to spend several<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC5765-00000047"/> eral weeks. I leave the house in your charge. On my return I will promote you to the position of office messenger. If you serve me faithfully I will make a man of you." Terence thanked him many times, and withdrew, seemingly delighted over his future prospects.</p>
               <p>"A sly, cunning fox," muttered Stranford; "just the tool I require, invaluable to me for certain purposes. I will feed him with the hope of elevation, and make him as pliable to my touch as putty. Van Vickle is right, I am an indulgent parent; no one could love an only child more than I do Sadie. I know that I have allowed both wife and daughter to influence me into extravagances which are ruinous, but there is no use of pondering over such burdensome expenses. It is either triumph or woe in the fashionable world. Keep up a brave heart, DeWitt Stranford; that's the only hope for a man involved; Sadie will marry enormous wealth. Aye, and her husband will have to save the reputation of his wife's family, by returning the portion of Dora's estate already squandered; but I must have a surer, a deadlier aim than this. Let me think. Joseph Bosway, elevated and honored, can shelter me from this coming disaster. If Dora remains single I need have no apprehension or fear; for under such circumstances I could appeal to her for mercy, and she would forgive me. But a woman of her disposition is sure to marry, and Bosway must be the man. He has great abilities, and, with slight pecuniary aid, would soon become distinguished. Dora would then overlook his origin; her friendship would ripen into love, and Joseph would then become the successful suitor. I should then throw myself upon his clemency, and plead that my love for him influenced me to use Dora's wealth in obtaining the nominations which exalted him and made her his wife. His noble, generous soul would forgive all, and she would never know of DeWitt Stranford's embezzlement. How fortunate that Dora desired to spend the summer with Mrs. Dawn. No fascinating beaux there to win the heart, except that drunken son of the widow's, and there is no danger of such a piece of humanity engaging her affections. All depends upon my aptness to take advantage of the offerings of time, and my shrewdness of execution."</p>

               <p>JOSEPH BOSWAY sauntered in the park of Washington Square, endeavoring to arouse his dejected spirits. Miss Danton was in the country, consequently he was the only occupant of her abode. Few windows of the houses that surrounded the Square were illuminated. Many of the edifices presented signs of desertion, and seemed to frown with a dreary aspect, forgotten by those who dwelt within their sheltering arms in the stormy winter. Joseph seated himself upon a bench, and listened to the murmuring water of the fountain that glistened in the dim rays of the park lights. "Each succeeding generation tion of man forms a fountain of life," thought Joseph. "Actuated by the same desires, they rush forth from the mouth of existence; leap madly up for fame; reach the zenith of their strength, and falling through succeeding intervals of age, lose their boasted identity in the waters of death. Time in its rapid flight will soon carry me to the zenith of my strength, from which I shall fall to the bosom of death, in whose waters will be lost all traces of a life that came from a source equally obscure. How merciful that death should be a mystery, that the sceptre, that wafts life from the tenements of earth, reigns with terror over every animated breast. If we knew whence we came, and whither we go, life would be eternal. If we could explain the mystery, this would be heaven or hell. Man is uncertainty, he is surrounded by uncertainties; he builds his earthly hopes on uncertainties; he seeks to gather erratic joys from the hand of uncertainty; he tries to preserve treasures which in the breezes of adversity soar away on the coquettish wings of uncertainty; each distinct division of existence, that is, each breath, is uncertainty." A little girl was playfully throwing pebbles into the reservoir of the fountain; her merry laugh caught Joseph's ear, and he amusedly watched her capers. An adjacent gaslight revealed her form, and partly showed the poverty of her garments. Perceiving that she was favorably observed, she became bold, and approaching Joseph, gazed<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC5765-00000049"/> into his face with a smile. There was something about the child that interested and induced him to speak kindly to her. She crawled upon the bench beside him, and commenced in a playful way to slap his hands, and trifle with his watch-guard.</p>
               <p>"What is your name?"</p>
               <p>"Amy Ray."</p>
               <p>"How many brothers and sisters have you?"</p>
               <p>"None; nor no father, nor no mother."</p>
               <p>"Who takes care of you then?"</p>
               <p>"Why g'am'ma."</p>
               <p>"You poor little innocent," said Joseph.</p>
               <p>"No, I am not poor," replied the child, opening wide her eyes. "I am rich, ga'm'ma says. I have a great big Father up in the sky, and oh! He is ever so rich; and she says when I grow up to be a big girl, if I am good, He will love me, and give me nice things; and when I die He will give me a crown, and a harp, and nice white wings. Oh! then won't I be happy, and won't I fly, ever so fast and ever so high? I'll go to the sun for a golden beam, and I'll go to the moon to see the old man, and get some green cheese; I wonder how it would taste? I've got lots of nice things at home. I got a doll without a head; I didn't break it; ga'm'ma got it, just that way, from a little girl that lives in Fifth Avenue, and I got lots of little tiny bits of colored glass, and I got a piece of broom, and an old tin cup, and an awful big bone. I have lots of fun. G'am'ma goes out a-washing all day, and I play with Tommy—you don't know Tommy; he is a big black cat, with a white spot between his eyes. You couldn't play with him, he would scratch you; I love Tommy and he loves me. Can you stop cats from purring? I can't stop Tommy. He makes an awful noise."</p>
               <p>"I like to hear a cat purr," said Joseph.</p>
               <p>"But you would not like to hear Tommy. He often wakes g'am'ma up in the night; that's why I should like to cure him. G'am'ma says Tommy is a happy cat, and that by his purring he is trying to imitate a bird."</p>
               <p>At this juncture a woman, who had been seated upon an adjacent bench, approached them, and said:</p>
               <p>"Come, Amy, we must go home. I hope she has not troubled you, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Not the slightest," replied Joseph. "On the contrary, she has been highly entertaining." Amy obeyed without a murmur, and bid Joseph goodnight, taking the woman's proffered hand.</p>
               <p>Shortly after their departure, Joseph arose, and proceeded homeward. The child's voice echoed in his ear. He had learned from little Amy his first lesson of contentment. Mrs. Ray and Amy passed leisurely down Wooster Street. On nearing Bleecker, they entered an old dilapidated building, and climbed a rickety staircase which led them up to the attic. They entered an apartment, the furniture of which consisted of a table with one leaf<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC5765-00000050"/> gone, and a spliced leg; three chairs, fit associates for the table; a small cooking-stove that could claim undoubted credentials of having served several families. A row of pans and plates stood on a shelf, underneath which, from two spikes, hung a water kettle and a huge iron pot. The sides of the room were defaced in many places where the plaster had entirely deserted the lath, the ceiling diversified in like manner. The apartment was lighted by two small windows, the broken panes of which had their discrepancies covered with bits of pasted paper. The poverty of Mrs. Ray's abode had not excluded cleanliness; every article testified to its presence. Amy had repeated her evening prayer, and her childish glee was hushed in the land of slumbers. Mrs. Ray had seated herself by the open window, where the fresh air of night could fan her cheek. A slight glance would reveal to the reader that she was the same poor creature, who, in a previous chapter, had irritated Miss Sadie Stranford by being allowed to ride in a public conveyance.</p>

               <p>COME, Vinter, join in the dance; it an't fair that you should remain a mere looker-on. Dayles and I can't begin to attend to the ladies of our acquaintance."</p>
               <p>"I can't help you, Van Vickle; I an't a going to blister myself, old boy, for the gratification of a few stuffed silks. You and Dayles can have the glory; I know you like it, but, you see, I don't."</p>
               <p>"My dear fellow," remonstrated Van Vickle, "remember that beaux are very scarce this season, and many fair creatures are actually compelled to become wall-flowers."</p>
               <p>"I don't care; it an't my fault that the market is overstocked; their old governors should have had better perception than to have brought their wares to a market where they are not appreciated. You see, I take a simple business view of the matter. You can't blame me, Van Vickle; I understand this fashionable flutter; it's just like horse-dealing. This<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC5765-00000051"/> town of Saratoga is a regular market; there is more swapping of pockets for human souls and human souls for pockets than in any other spot on this tumbling world. I haven't been here five seasons for nothing. For instance, there is that Miss Watt; she comes every year with fifty-two trunks, one for each day of her stay. Consequently, first morning after arrival she appears at breakfast in an elegant morning negligée; after breakfast walks to the springs in another costume; at dinner she appears with graces and smiles, and still another change; twilight finds her arrayed in something else, and every night she trips the light fantastic toe in a different ball dress. Second day still greater changes, and the third increases on the second, as much as the second on the first; so matters continue until time has exhausted the contents of her trunks, when she quietly withdraws with the qualification of having filled each fair angel's heart with a heavy weight of envy.—She is only a sample. To a certain extent they all ape her. They leave home for a change, and I must confess, it is a continued change, and you can just bet your last dollar it is a change, that takes the last change out of a good many squeezed pockets. Why, there are so many changes, that if a man don't keep his eyes open and his wits about him, he will become confused, and d— me, if he can tell who is who or what is what. Now, don't consider this a lecture, old covey; it is only a slight effervescence."</p>
               <p>"You are an odd stick, Vinter."</p>
               <p>At this moment the orchestra commenced a gliding waltz; Van Vickle left Vinter and hastened to enjoy the dance with Sadie Stranford. Sadie was the undisputed belle of Saratoga; there was no end to the list of her admirers; no end to the hosts that gathered around her and heaped upon her the most deceitful flattery. Her smile had become more coquettish, her carriage more haughty, and her triumphs had made more perceptible her supreme selfishness. Mr. Stranford watched her graceful form in the dance. His heart glowed with satisfaction, and a joy possessed him which rendered him forgetful of the steps he had taken from the path of honor. To pamper his idol, he was willing to make any sacrifice; to gratify her, he could use, without the least hesitation, the entrusted funds of his orphan niece. His indulgence had become so great, that sooner than deny his own child, he would willingly beggar his sister's. Van Vickle had finished waltzing with Sadie, and was capering (as Vinter would say) with another piece of saleable goods. Sadie had taken the proffered arm of Major Bigby, and they had gone out on the verandah. She looked bewitchingly up into the handsome Major's face; there was something about the Major that she liked; she really enjoyed his society, for he differed greatly from all her other admirers. He had annoyed her many times by his plain speeches, but his gentlemanly<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC5765-00000052"/> manly manner of expressing himself prevented her from cherishing any serious umbrage.</p>
               <p>"Why is it," said Sadie, in a half-modest way, "that your society pleases me more than that of others?"</p>
               <p>"Because I jeer instead of flattering you," replied the Major, laughingly.</p>
               <p>"I know you do," said Sadie; "you told me yesterday afternoon, down by the spring, that I would be an irresistible little woman but for one thing—and that one thing was selfishness. I think it mean of you to talk to me so horridly; why do you think I am selfish?"</p>
               <p>"To be candid, Miss Stranford, you are too fond of admiration, and in my opinion, that is the worst symptom of selfishness."</p>
               <p>"You horrid man, I won't promenade with you. Admiration! selfishness! I never heard of such a thing. I don't seek to be admired; if the men are attentive, I can't help it."</p>
               <p>"But every one is answerable for her dress, and if you seek notoriety by a continual change of costly apparel, it is evident that you love to shine in the eyes of others."</p>
               <p>"Why, what strange ideas you have; how dress can possibly affect one's generosity I am unable to discern."</p>
               <p>"You are young yet; age will make you realize the truth of my assertions."</p>
               <p>"I am glad of it," said Sadie, "I shouldn't like to appreciate them until old Father Time wrinkles my forehead. Come, Major, let us have some pleasant topic. What do you think of Miss Claston's dress?"</p>
               <p>"There you go again; I refrain from an opinion."</p>
               <p>"Well, if that don't suit, tell me something about the stars," said Sadie, coquettishly.</p>
               <p>He complied with her wish, and went into a long, mystical narrative, that interested Sadie greatly. In the meantime, Van Vickle was in great distress. He tried to be gallant, but his efforts were not successful. After an hour had elapsed, he resolutely went in search of the major and Sadie.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to relieve you of your charge, Major, but Miss Stranford must go in; she is liable to take cold."</p>
               <p>"I will not allow you to dictate to me in that manner, Mr. Van Vickle," said Sadie.</p>
               <p>"When the lady desires to return to the ballroom, I think I am abundantly able to conduct her there without your interference."</p>
               <p>"What do you mean, sir?" retorted Van Vickle.</p>
               <p>"That you had better mind your own business," said the Major.</p>
               <p>"You've insulted me, sir."</p>
               <p>"Don't make a fool of yourself," replied the Major.</p>
               <p>"I demand satisfaction or an explanation."</p>
               <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC5765-00000053"/>
               <p>"The former you shall have, but the latter, never," coolly laughed the Major.</p>
               <p>Sadie appeared greatly amused, and joined in the Major's laugh. She had no apprehensions that Harry Van Vickle's demands amounted to anything but bluster. Van Vickle went off in a towering rage to find Vinter. He discovered that distinguished gentleman in the bar-room. After relating the affray, Vinter calmly advised him to challenge the Major.</p>
               <p>"You old cuss you, don't you be afraid of a man because he wears shoulder-straps; half of them are cowards. Be a brave boy; don't let him brow-beat you."</p>
               <p>"But," said Van Vickle, "he might accept."</p>
               <p>"No he won't; it an't in him. You do as I dictate, and he will leave Sadie Stranford alone in the future."</p>
               <p>"I suppose I must," said Van Vickle, with a sigh.</p>
               <p>"Here is the Major now," said Vinter. "I'll soon settle this. Major Bigby, a few words, if you please. Mr. Van Vickle has requested me to tender you an informal challenge; if agreeable, we will meet you by four o'clock to-morrow morning, three miles up the road toward Balston Springs. About a mile beyond the old red farm-house. There is a deep ravine to the right of the turnpike; a quiet place, where you gentlemen can procure satisfaction without interruption. I have a splendid brace of pistols, just the thing."</p>
               <p>"This is child's play," interrupted the Major. "There is no necessity for such a step."</p>
               <p>Van Vickle had been quaking with fear; but when he heard the Major's answer, he became as bold as a lion. "Sir," said he, rising, "I demand satisfaction; if you are a gentleman and not a coward, you will grant it."</p>
               <p>"If that is the manner in which you express yourself, you shall be accommodated."</p>
               <p>This reply had a tendency to make Van Vickle hesitate and quake again.</p>
               <p>"But this matter is getting serious," said Major Bigby. "Come, let us shake hands and be friends."</p>
               <p>Van Vickle would listen to no compromise. He demanded satisfaction or an apology for the insult of the Major in the presence of Sadie Stranford.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Van Vickle, I shall never comply with your demands. I have extended to you the hand of peace, which you have rejected. I will therefore meet you at the time and place designated by your friend, and with the weapons of your own choice settle this difficulty." His black eyes glistened with a fearful determination as he turned and left the bar-room.</p>
               <p>"You see what you have done, Vinter," said Van Vickle, turning white. "I shall be killed, murdered, butchered by this fellow. It will never do; Vinter, you must prevent it."</p>
               <p>"Don't talk like a child; take a little brandy and you will feel better by and by. Prevent it! how<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC5765-00000054"/> can I prevent it? Do you think I am going to intercede with the Major and ask him to overlook your folly? Why, it would be cowardly, disgraceful, and, besides, it would be the gossip of the Springs for a month. But don't think he will appear; he is a regular bluffer; I'm sure he is."</p>
               <p>These remarks of Vinter's had rather a soothing effect upon Van Vickle's nerves. The night was whiled away in drinking and smoking, until about two o'clock, when Vinter brought from his room his brace of pistols, and presented them to Van Vickle for inspection. That gentleman examined them closely, and for a few moments became very thoughtful; then broke the silence by saying in a low, confidential voice:</p>
               <p>"My dear Vinter, my dear friend, I have a request, a serious request to make; will you grant it?"</p>
               <p>"What is it?" said Vinter.</p>
               <p>"Promise you will grant it."</p>
               <p>"I will say probably," replied Vinter.</p>
               <p>"Then," whispered Van Vickle, placing his mouth near Vinter's ear, "when you load the pistols leave out the balls."</p>
               <p>"Why, you piece of absurdity, that would spoil all the fun."</p>
               <p>"You may call it fun, Mr. Vinter, but if you were in my place you would consider it anything but fun."</p>
               <p>"Van Vickle, old boy, what ails your pluck? Has your blood turned to water?"</p>
               <p>"Don't talk to me about blood, pluck, and water. I know my life is in danger, and that is serious enough, without making light of it."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Vinter, in a drawl, "if it will calm your shattered nerves, I will fool the Major by assenting to your proposition."</p>
               <p>"My best and dearest friend," said Van Vickle, "how can I ever repay you?"</p>
               <p>"Don't speak of it, my boy—don't speak of it."</p>
               <p>The morning began to streak the sky; a man dismounted, and after fastening the bridle of his horse to a low branch of an old oak, drew his army cloak close around him and proceeded towards two dusky figures in the distance.</p>
               <p>"Here he comes, all alone," said Vinter.</p>
               <p>"He has no intention of being injured," responded Van Vickle.</p>
               <p>"Good-morning, gentlemen," said the Major, extending his hand to Vinter, and then to Van Vickle: "The sooner this work is done the better. What are your weapons? Pistols? Very well. Mark the space out, Mr. Vinter."</p>
               <p>Van Vickle and the Major took their positions; Vinter counted one—two—three!—a loud report broke the stillness of the morning; the smoke arose, and Van Vickle and the Major stepped uninjured from their places.</p>
               <p>"Foul play, gentlemen; I'm sure there's foul play. I never miss my mark. Who loaded?"</p>
               <p>"I," said Vinter.</p>
               <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC5765-00000055"/>
               <p>"We must have another exchange of shots," replied the Major. "I will load; you gentlemen can witness the operation and judge of its fairness."</p>
               <p>The loading was soon performed, and the duellists had resumed their former positions. "One—two—" before Vinter counted three, Van Vickle had fallen in a swoon, which put an end to the contest, and prevented the Major from shedding the gallant Harry Van Vickle's blood. Vinter was unable to resuscitate his friend until the clattering hoofs of the Major's horse echoed in the distance.</p>

               <p>DORA placed the last article in, and closed the lid of her trunk, and then looked languidly out of the window. Nature was slumbering in Winter's icy grasp; lofty mountains, broad fields and lowly valleys were decorated in the apparel of King Frost. The moaning wind and blurring light of December increased the sadness of her heart. To-morrow she would part with her dearest friend; to-morrow she would leave the Dawn mansion—the only abode in which she had enjoyed the endearments of home since her sunny childhood—and return to the cold, fashionable surroundings of her uncle's house. Gladly would she<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC5765-00000056"/> have tarried in her present home, and basked in the gentle affection of Mrs. Dawn, until the links of her life's chain were drawn out; but necessity forced her from this sphere of enjoyment into the stern reality of duty. Reverence for a dear father's wishes was the incentive which urged her to return. Life would be an Elysian dream, a placid summer lake, if parting, with its tornado of pain, did not upheave our bosom of existence; but if our barks forever floated over the waters of peaceful fellowship, would not earnestness, with its admonitions of futurity, be smothered in our hearts by selfishness?</p>
               <p>Tranquillity is a dangerous pilot to steer one's course through the narrow, rocky straits which lead to the haven of rest. Frailty and weakness are better sailors; they awaken us to the unavoidable changes of time, and through all vicissitudes keep our eyes upon the Guiding Star. Dora was aroused from her meditations by the approaching step of Mrs. Dawn; she turned from the window, and brushed away a tear.</p>
               <p>"Through packing? why, I came to aid you."</p>
               <p>"You have my gratitude, as though you had rendered me the most valuable assistance."</p>
               <p>"I have a surprise for you, Dora, in the shape of an odd present," said Mrs. Dawn, as she took from her pocket a small jewel case. "A quaint locket and chain, isn't it? See if you can recognize the likeness?"</p>
               <p>Dora took the locket, and scrutinized the features, but was unable to discern whom it resembled.</p>
               <p>"Why, Dora," said Mrs. Dawn, laughingly, "is it possible you do not see a resemblance? Recall the faces of your friends."</p>
               <p>Dora looked again, but confessed her inability to recognize the original.</p>
               <p>"Would you be surprised if you learnt that it was I?"</p>
               <p>"Dora laughed outright; but on taking another look at the miniature, wondered that she had not observed the resemblance at a glance.</p>
               <p>"It was taken just after my marriage; I was eighteen then. Promise me you will wear it. This may appear strange to you, but it is a whim. Your mother was a dear friend of mine; we shared the happy romps of childhood, and sympathized in loving maidenhood. I married; we parted, never to meet again. That day comes back to me now, with its joy and sadness. I gained a true and noble husband, and lost my friend. We corresponded; nevertheless an estrangement grew up between us. I, the matured wife and mother, looked upon my early friend as a bright spirit of the past. Two years after Edmund's birth she married, and then all intercourse between us ceased. I grieved for her sad and sudden end, with a sister's grief; and have reproved myself, many times, for the neglect that chilled our friendship. It will please me, that my likeness, taken in those early years,<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC5765-00000057"/> should be associated with her child. You resemble her so closely, that sometimes when I am conversing with you, I imagine myself young again, and back in the dear old village of M—. Now that smile is just like your mother's; if you knew what sweet recollections of the past your presence calls up, if you knew how those recollections twined around the girlhood form of your dear mother, you would not wonder at this odd fancy of mine."</p>
               <p>Dora received the gift, and passing the chain to which it clung over her head, adjusted it.</p>
               <p>"Besides, Dora," continued Mrs. Dawn, "remember what you have done; but for your efforts, Edmund would never have been reclaimed; how can I repay you, child of my childhood's friend?"</p>
               <p>"His will and fortitude are the good giants that vanquished his deadly foe."</p>
               <p>"Yes! but the charm of your influence roused them from their slumbers, and each blow of these goodly giants was often strengthened by your earnest prayers."</p>
               <p>A bright fire of dry hickory crackled upon the broad hearth, and its smoke curled gracefully up the great chimney; bright embers threw out their glow and mingled peacefully with the rays of a huge Astral lamp. Around this cheerful fire were gathered Dora, Edmund, and his mother. Dora's head rested gently upon Mrs. Dawn's shoulder; the wind howled furiously without, and whistled down the great chimney; the fire leaped and crackled cheeringly, and occasionally, with renewed vigor, gave a greater glow, that danced boldly into the room, flitting along the walls, and lighting up the huge shelves of books, adding life to the portraits, and shedding lustre on each face. Dora gazed into Edmund's face; the features had lost their distorted and bloated look; the eyes, no longer bloodshot, beamed with a quiet peace. A feeling stole unawares into Dora's heart; she saw that Edmund Dawn was growing handsome.</p>
               <p>The next day Mrs. Dawn bade Dora farewell, and went to her room, where she wept for hours. Dora hushed her sobs and dried her tears; but the look which Mrs. Dawn had given her—the long, pleading look—went with her to her home, and in after years often came to her with its saddening effects. The rumbling car-wheels, and Edmund's continuous narrative of college jokes and boyish pranks, partly restored Dora's usual spirits; and the warm welcome which she received at the end of her journey, made her quite herself again.</p>

               <p>MISS DANTON looked inquiringly through her spectacles at Joseph Bosway. Scanning his features with more than ordinary scrutiny, she observed the troubled look that was beginning, at times, to assume a supremacy where hope and joy hitherto had had undisputed sway.</p>
               <p>"Come, Joseph, do try and eat something; it won't do for you to live in this way; you will make yourself sick; you partook of a very slight breakfast this morning, and I presume you neglected to have lunch down-town. Be honest; you haven't eaten since breakfast, have you?"</p>
               <p>Joseph smiled at her earnestness, and confessed his omission. The good old lady placed a dish of buttered toast before him, and coaxingly induced him to try a piece. He took several mouthfuls and a cup of tea, but her best endeavors were of no avail; Joseph could not be induced to even taste the choice delicacies with which she tried to tempt him, and with a sigh of disappointment, she relinquished her efforts. Joseph saw her discomfort, and laughingly said:</p>
               <p>"My dear Miss Danton, you have not forgotten the old saying, 'You may lead a horse to water, but cannot make him drink;' I appreciate your kindness, and would gladly partake of your bountiful supper, but my system seems to have a thorough aversion to food; I hope you will not censure me for it."</p>
               <p>"Why, you foolish boy, I do not blame you, but I do wish you would eat."</p>
               <p>"Never mind, don't worry; my appetite will come back again; some morning I will come down to breakfast, and eat you out of house and home; this is only a temporary flicker, it will pass away in a day or two."</p>
               <p>He looked humorously into the old lady's face, and she, forgetting her distress, smiled.</p>
               <p>"Never mind, auntie," said Joseph, rising and patting her on the back. "Your boy will do justice to the knife and fork yet."</p>
               <p>Joseph went to his apartment, and Miss Danton returned to her cosey parlor, and taking her seat by the fire, resumed her knitting; she sighed and muttered, and muttered and sighed, and between her sighs and mutterings, gave vent to short soliloquies: "Political intrigues—death of him—I wish<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC5765-00000059"/> all the wire-pullers, as they call them, were in Jericho—they have no faculty for gaining a livelihood, except by bothering other folks, and twisting comfort out of every creature that comes near them. I wish they would stop harassing him; it is bad enough to make him a public servant, without taking his appetite away. These elections are strange things; I thought, after the day with its commotions had gone, that Joseph would lose his anxiety, and brighten again; but his genial humor does not return. Botheration! I wish old Stranford would leave the boy alone, and not put such trash as political elevation in his head; it will be the ruin of him." She drew on her yarn, and a yard or two loosened from the ball in her pocket, and coiled about her dress; she caught up a stitch and continued her knitting.</p>
               <p>Joseph had been an inmate of Miss Danton's home for over fifteen years. She had forgotten that he was merely her lodger; the gentleness of his disposition, and his long residence with her, had made her consider him wholly her own. Joseph, on entering his room, seated himself in his old armchair, and commenced perusing the evening papers; the topics of the day failed to engross his attention, and shortly after, he laid the paper down and gazed into the cheerful fire. "Shall I go to Stranford's party?" After long reflection he decided not; he would not venture into the presence of Dora Elveston, without assurance from her that she desired his company. The love for her which he had nurtured must be conquered; he must strive to live a different life, one more in accordance with his birth; one that did not seek an alliance that was impossible; one that would be purer, and nobler in purpose, than the gilded one Stranford had pictured for him. He tried to become interested in Milton's "Paradise Lost," but after an hour's weary effort, he laid down the work, and rising, paced the floor, the query still in his mind—should he go to Stranford's or not? He looked at his watch, then paused in front of Dora Elveston's likeness, which decorated the wall above the mantel-piece. It called back many happy hours of the past; he turned, and opening his desk, took out her last epistle. Its sisterly sympathy increased the ardor of his love, his glowing impulse decided the query. Two hours later he was the centre of attraction in the parlors of the Stranford mansion; mothers with marriageable daughters were exceedingly gracious, some were even bold, in their anxiety to pay him homage. The fair and beautiful used woman's art to win his recognition; old men with their millions grasped him warmly by the hand, while dandy fops, of the Vinter and Van Vickle style, hated and envied him. In former gatherings of this kind he would have passed unobserved. What had produced this change? What had turned a fashionable circle from indifference to flattering adulation? It could not have been his appearance, for that, with the exception<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC5765-00000060"/> ception of looking older, and more careworn, was unchanged; it could not have been his name, for he spelled it the same. No! it was an affix that gained him such distinction. The Hon. Joseph Bosway was a rising man; it was this that made him the lion of the evening. He avoided Dora during the first hours of the entertainment, and intended to go home without showing her marked attention. But she baffled his purpose. Approaching him unawares, she tapped him playfully with her fan. He turned, and met the full gaze of her radiant eyes.</p>
               <p>"Ah! Mr. Bosway, your success has taught you to forsake old friends," said Dora, in a coquettish accent.</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, Miss Elveston; I did not intend to slight you. I should gladly have sought you earlier in the evening, but you were surrounded by those who are much more capable of interesting their auditors."</p>
               <p>"A very poor excuse, Mr. Bosway, considering that this is my first appearance after a long absence. But I will not be haughty or incredulous; I will endeavor to appreciate your motive, and believe you did not purposely slight me for new acquaintances. I hope fate has dealt leniently with you since our parting?"</p>
               <p>"I have no reason to complain, Miss Elveston; popular opinion has elevated me in the <unclear>estimation</unclear> of man, but my spirit thirsts more than ever for advancement, more than ever do I crave renown."</p>
               <p>"Is this what you battle for?" replied Dora, with a slight tone of pity.</p>
               <p>"No; there is a brighter, far nobler hope, that whispers courage in my lonely hours."</p>
               <p>"And that hope? Pray tell me."</p>
               <p>"Ask me no more; the future will make it a reality of joy or a crown of woe."</p>
               <p>Sadie had monopolized Edmund, partly to rid herself of Van Vickle, and partly to excite the Major's jealousy. She entertained him in her most delightful manner; he often smiled at her pettish ways, and seemed so greatly pleased that the little vixen flattered herself that she was reducing the battlement of his heart, and would soon obtain an easy conquest. The guests had partaken of a sumptuous repast; the elders were quietly withdrawing from the scene, whilst the younger portion of the gathering were preparing for a German, under the leadership of the exquisite Van Vickle and gallant Major Bigby. Strange to relate, since that eventful morning, in which the Major met Van Vickle in the secluded grove, that gentleman had paid devoted attention and manifested a firm attachment for his dear friend, the Major. Boisterous shouts occasionally came from the supper room; Vinter, in all his glory presided; champagne corks flew thick and <unclear>fast.</unclear> Blinks added also to the merriment by his numerous toasts. His little wife, dressed in a plain<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC5765-00000061"/> brown silk, had spent a lonely evening in a remote corner; her shudder was discernible when the hilarious noise from the dining-hall penetrated to the dancing-room. Joseph was Dora's partner; Edmund, being a poor dancer, took a position in one of the doorways leading from the parlor into the hall. Mr. Stranford stood near him. Edmund's appearance was so different from the idea he had entertained of him, as the drunken son of Widow Dawn, that he was perplexed and startled. He felt considerable uneasiness, and feared that by allowing Dora to spend the summer at Mount Glibe he had jeopardized the arrangement which he had made for Joseph; but the twinkle came back to his selfish little eyes when he perceived that Dora was Joseph's partner. It was Joseph's and Dora's turn to lead; they glided by in a graceful waltz.</p>
               <p>"A well-mated, handsome couple," said Mr. Stranford; "with all their protestations to the contrary, I believe they have been lovers for over a year. This is stupid work, Dawn, watching this whirligig; come, join me in a bottle of wine."</p>
               <p>"I thank you; but I must decline."</p>
               <p>"I can't admit of it; you are my guest, and should favor me by taking one glass, if nothing more."</p>
               <p>"You will really have to excuse me, Mr. Stranford; I must refrain. I am a temperance man."</p>
               <p>"Pooh! nonsense; it won't hurt you: temperance men never refuse wine on these occasions; don't become a blue-nose at your age."</p>
               <p>"Nor a red-nose either," replied Edmund.</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! good, very good; but we arn't dealing in noses."</p>
               <p>Mr. Stranford withdrew to join the wine-bibbers; he felt his nose, wondering if Dawn intended to cast any reflections upon his prominent feature. He was too happy, however, to be troubled by so casual a circumstance; his mind had been relieved, and hope gilded his future expectations.</p>
               <p>Poor Edmund's heart sank within him. Mr. Stranford's remarks had crushed him; Dora Elveston was loved by another; that love, he had every reason to believe, was reciprocated. The festivity had lost its allurement. He quietly withdrew from the Stranford mansion. Approaching daylight dispersed the brilliant gathering. Dora retired to her apartment. "What a strange expression," she mused; "the future will make it a crown of joy, or a reality of woe. What could Joseph Bosway have meant? Edmund departed strangely; what queer, odd beings men are, anyway." The singular expression and sudden departure had marred the pleasure of her evening.</p>

               <p>THE night was dark and gloomy. A storm of snow had been raging for two hours; its white flakes began to thicken and hush the rumbling of vehicles. Walking was difficult, especially where the quick hands of the wind had heaped up the drifts. The street lamps, covered with flakes and ornamented with icicles, were the only objects that lent a cheer to the dreary night. A storm also raged in Edmund's heart. He drew his cloak tightly around him, and proceeded towards Broadway. This spacious thoroughfare was almost deserted. At Fifteenth Street he paused in the shade of the Old Stone Church. One, two, sounded the deep-toned bell, and the furious storm bore the echoes far away. The trees in Union Square tossed their boughs and groaned beneath the pressure of the gale. Among these dismal tones mingled the plaintive cry of a child. Edmund looked from whence it came, and discerned upon the step of the church a little creature, crowded in a heap, sobbing bitterly. "Little wanderer," he said in a gentle tone, "what keeps you here this dreadful night?"</p>
               <p>Before the child answered, a rough voice said, "Don't heed her, stranger; she is here every night, and sets up just such a pitiful wail. I have been deceived by the little devil at least a dozen times."</p>
               <p>"I shan't desert a child on a night like this," replied Edmund. "I will carry her home, if she has any."</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha!" laughed the man. "That's good; you are surely green. Why, you couldn't take her half a block before her debauched mother would overtake you and demand the young one. She is probably lurking in the rear of the church now."</p>
               <p>Edmund was aware of the deceptions practised in large cities. He heeded the man's warning, and after dropping a few cents into the child's lap, joined his adviser. They walked several blocks in silence. A voice whispered to Edmund, "Dora Elveston loves another. Tear down this bearer of a pledge; drown your grief in drink. You made it for her sake, why keep it? She will never be anything to you. Don't fight any longer; give way. One glass won't hurt you; it will strengthen you, and stop the gnawing pain of disappointed love." They were passing a drinking saloon, or devil's church. The stranger, grasping Edmund by the arm, said:</p>
               <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC5765-00000063"/>
               <p>"Come in and join me. Ninety-nine doctors out of a hundred would recommend it on a night like this."</p>
               <p>Edmund hesitated. That hesitation has ruined thousands; has filled hell; has robbed heaven of its fairest angels, and drawn a chain around the world, the links of which are the shackles that hold millions in misery and despair. The variegated lights flickered, and seemed to say, "Come in; warm welcome from the storm."</p>
               <p>Poor Edmund, pity him! His body chilled by the storm without; his heart frozen by the storm within; pity and ever forgive him. The bar was a fashionable one, if such places can boast of a distinction of fashion; they all deal out the same inevitable ruin, no matter how they serve it, whether in costly glasses or common earthenware. On every brow they all chisel the same brand of drunkard. No refinement can prevent this imprint, nor can wealth buy immunity.</p>
               <p>"Here's to the renewal of our acquaintance," said the stranger, as their eyes met.</p>
               <p>Edmund dropped his glass, exclaiming, "Great God! You here, James Attobee, to tempt me, to urge me back to the path of degradation."</p>
               <p>He said no more, but rushed wildly into the night. After going a few blocks he calmed his passion. Then clasped his hands and raising his face heavenward, gave praise for his strange deliverance. The pleading cry of the child echoed in his heart; changing his course he hastened toward the Old Stone Church; the steps were deserted. He stood bewildered and perplexed, reproaching himself for heeding the stranger who turned out to be James Attobee. He resolved to find the little outcast or her abode. This he could do by tracing her tracks. The rays of the light which stood in front of the church revealed which way the little feet had gone; each succeeding lamp distinctly showed the footprints in the pure white snow. He quickened his pace, and after a long run discovered the object of his search seated upon the base stone of the iron fence of Washington Park.</p>
               <p>The little unfortunate, weary from her tramp, and benumbed by the cold, had sought a rest which would have ended in death but for his timely rescue. He raised her, and covered her with the folds of his cloak; then drew his arms around her, and held her close to his great warm heart.</p>
               <p>"Come, little one, tell me where you live?"</p>
               <p>The child sobbed at "Number — Wooster Street."</p>
               <p>"Pray, what brought you out this terrible night?"</p>
               <p>The poor little creature made no answer, but commenced to weep bitterly.</p>
               <p>"Don't, little mite; dry up your tears, and tell me did any one compel you to come out?"</p>
               <p>"No," said the child, almost inaudibly, through her sobs. "G'am'ma, poor G'am'ma is so sick. We have had nothing to eat for two days."</p>
               <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC5765-00000064"/>
               <p>"Can it be possible," thought Edmund, "in this large city of plenty, where wealth and extravagance abound, that any human being should want bread? Is there a just God, to hear the prayers of the starving, to behold their emaciated forms? Then what final retribution awaits those who throw into the whirlpool of dissipation and folly that which would alleviate the wants of the homeless, and drive starvation from the land?" He walked in a meditative mood for some time, then stopped and said: "Is this the house?"</p>
               <p>The child put her little head out from under his cloak and directed him to the top floor. There was no light in the room. A lamp from the opposite side of the street threw up just enough glimmer to reveal the outlines of the various objects in the apartment. Edmund had placed the child upon the bed, and was about retracing his steps in search of food and fuel, when the woman motioned him to stay, and said in a depressed tone:</p>
               <p>"Kind sir, don't trouble yourself about me; it is too late, too late; as for Amy, I am sure she will have plenty on the morrow."</p>
               <p>"I don't feel hungry, G'am'ma," cried the child; "I wish you had something to eat, and fire to warm you. Oh! G'am'ma, how cold your cheek is."</p>
               <p>"Yes, darling, no earthly warmth can remove it; to-morrow little Amy will be alone."</p>
               <p>"Why, G'am'ma," said the child in a tone of anguish, "are you going to leave me, poor little Amy, all alone?"</p>
               <p>"Don't weep, darling, you will be cared for."</p>
               <p>Edmund extending his hand, rested it upon the woman's brow; the chill that met it went to his very heart's core. He removed his cloak, placed it over the woman and child; then drew up a chair beside the bed, and taking the sufferer's rigid hand, inquired if he could be of any service in this hour of darkness.</p>
               <p>"Ah, sir! I know not how you came; the angels must have guided you hither to watch the last flutterings of my life." With a great exertion she raised herself upright in the bed; the few rays that entered the window played softly around her face. Edmund saw the expression of her pale and wasted countenance. Death had commenced to make its cast; the eyes shone bright with radiant hope reflected from the skies. Each feature wore a weary, tender look; patience and long suffering were pictured there. Hesitatingly she said:</p>
               <p>"Dear, kind sir, this hour would be a bright, a happy one, if Amy, poor little Amy, had a loving friend to care for her, to give her the protection of a home. If a strong arm was folded around her childish form, Death would be welcomed. Pity her, poor little friendless Amy; promise me that you will be that friend."</p>
               <p>"I will," replied Edmund, "and may God give me power to be faithful to your charge."</p>
               <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC5765-00000065"/>
               <p>"He will bless you—God will bless you," gasped the woman. "I have another trust, and you must swear that you will keep it." She made a violent effort, and drew from under her pillow a roll of parchment. Will you swear never to reveal the contents of this document until you find those who are concerned?"</p>
               <p>"I most solemnly do."</p>
               <p>"Thank God, I can die happy," and she fell back on her pillow exhausted.</p>
               <p>"Don't cry, pet, Grandma is happy, very happy," she whispered; "put your little arms around my neck, that is a good child; tighter, tighter, Amy; be a good girl, and love your new protector. Goodnight, darling, good-night."</p>
               <p>A few heavy sighs, a deep, long hush, the spirit had gone. Death was there, and in his presence dwelt that awful silence that calls forth dread and fear from the living. Amy lay motionless in the arms that a few moments ago had twined around her their last earthly affection. Edmund bent over the living and the dead, and coaxed Amy from the remains of Mrs. Ray. His gentleness sank into the child's heart; without the least resistance she allowed him to remove her. He took his cloak from the dead, and throwing it over his shoulders, drew it tightly around the living; then seated himself, and waited patiently for the coming morn. The dreadful silence of the chamber of death was only broken by Amy's sobs. Edmund's reflections carried him back to the brilliantly illuminated mansion of DeWitt Stranford. Again he heard the soft tones and dulcet swell of music; again he saw the dancing throng; again the thoughtless laugh came forth from the banquet; the bright smiles, the radiant eyes, the flushed cheeks, haughty pride, malice, jealousy, flattery, hatred, and revenge, blended in his vision. "Children of assumption, fortune, and waste," thought he; "children of deception, tell me, On what rock of ages do you lay your secret hope? On what gossamer thread of salvation do you swing your souls over the ocean of eternity? Oh, how soon will time's rotation awaken you, cruelly awaken you from these dreams of emptiness? Alas! how many awaken too late; their eyes open to the realities of life, when the shroud of death enfolds them. Come with me to this abode of poverty, crawl up those rickety stairs to this chamber of death, and in its awful silence, stand by the side of this almost coverless couch. What does this haggard face and these wasted limbs portray? Starvation, did you say? Aye, cruel starvation, fostered by you. You, who are born in the lap of opulence, by you who bask in the sunshine of extravagant indulgence. Have you forgotten the Avenger? The Hand that made this form corruption will reach into your abodes of selfish luxury. It will rest upon your gilded couches, its dreadful silence will pervade your chambers of repose. Poor, trembling souls, how will you meet the great judgment, and hear the<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC5765-00000066"/> Master say, 'Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.' Through our endless eternity the voice of starvation shall upbraid you."</p>

               <p>SHORTLY after daybreak Edmund procured the assistance of an old apple woman, named Malloy, who occupied an apartment on a flight below. He had some difficulty in inducing her to desert her occupation. The cunning old hag was manœuvring for a handsome fee, which he promised her. Edmund went back to the garret, and waited an hour or more for her coming; presently her step sounded on the stairs, and she came bunglingly into the room, and after taking a view of the remains, seated herself indifferently on the couch.</p>
               <p>"Did you know her?" inquired Edmund.</p>
               <p>"Of course I did, and a poor old crittur she was; she is better off than living the scanty way she did. Are you going to take the young one?"</p>
               <p>"Most assuredly; I am her protector now."</p>
               <pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC5765-00000067"/>
               <p>"Maybe you'll gim me your whereabouts, in case any one asks about her."</p>
               <p>"Quite right, my good woman." He wrote it out for her, informed her that he would return in the evening, then folded Amy in his arms, and proceeded to his hotel. During the afternoon he made the necessary arrangements for the funeral. Mrs. Malloy received him in a dreadful plight; she had been imbibing, and was naturally very superstitious. She declared she wouldn't stay after dark, indade she wouldn't, no, not for all the world. Sure, her life would be endangered by the ghosts.</p>
               <p>"My good woman, calm yourself; there is no such thing; it is ridiculous; the apparitions only appear in the imagination of the frightened."</p>
               <p>"Do you think I believe the likes of you; och! I know, me old mother, she was a wise old crittur, she was the one that could discarn about the sperrits. I often hard her say, that if one was troubled by something in life, they come back and haunted the house they lived in."</p>
               <p>"But, Mrs. Malloy," interrupted Edmund; "this woman died happy, and if there is any reason to believe your interpretation, her spirit will not return; she had no life annoyance as you describe."</p>
               <p>"Don't tell me that; I know better nor that, sir; no one writes their life, like she did, without something unknownst to the world destroyed them."</p>
               <p>"How do you know that she wrote her life?"</p>
               <p>"Becase I often sees her writing, and often wondered what a lone creetur like her would write for; so one evening I went to the garret when she and the child were out, and larnt her saycret."</p>
               <p>"My good woman, I hope you will quiet yourself and remain here during the night."</p>
               <p>"Do you think a poor crittur like me would risk her life—all she has? No, sir, I wouldn't stay if you gave me New York."</p>
               <p>Without any more ado, she threw her ragged shawl over her head, and left him alone with the corpse. He felt rather disconcerted, and provoked at the credulity of her Irish nature. As the night wore slowly away, he thought of Amy, and wondered if she would be fretted by his absence. The child had worried, and was unhappy; the loss of her grandma, and the sudden changes, startled and confused her; but the good chambermaid whom Edmund had enlisted in his service assuaged her grief and petted her to sleep. Mrs. Ray received a Christian burial, and little Amy was provided with a handsome outfit. Edmund was sorely perplexed by the selection of her apparel; he would gladly have summoned Dora to his aid, but feared her presence would only strengthen the feelings which he sought to conquer.</p>
               <p>Dora rang for her maid, to aid in the arrangement of her toilet; on entering, Lucy handed her a note, the seal of which she immediately broke, and read as follows:</p>

               <p>Dora was startled by the purport of this note, but she had no time for reflection; Joseph Bosway was momentarily expected, to take her a sleigh-riding. In her hurry and flutter, she returned the note to its envelope, and dropped it upon her dressing-table. The afternoon was bright and balmy, Fifth Avenue and the Park were crowded with gay equipages; the merry jingle of silver bells filled the air, and the clattering hoofs of Goshen's finest steeds beat out a cheerful unison of sound from the crisp snow. In the tide of fashion none were happier than Joseph and Dora; the rapid gait of his steed had borne them far beyond the environs of the city. Their conversation was entertaining, and the scene was charming; space and time passed away unperceived, nor were they fully aroused from their absorption until the messenger of rest commenced to fold his wings across the evening sky. Joseph headed his horse about, and the distance between them and home was slightly shortened before the azure canopy of heaven began to glisten with its emblems of purity. By and by the round, mellow moon came laughing out from behind a hill-top; everything seemed to dance with joy in the light of her good-humored face. They were also affected by her entrancing magic. It influenced him to relate the trials and privations of his early life; it called from her deep expressions of sympathy. It gave him courage to whisper how for years he had loved and cherished her image. How every noble aspiration that had actuated him was founded upon the hope that in some future day her love would recompense him a thousand-fold for his sufferings and struggles. He urged his suit with eloquence and feeling. A tender emotion of pity and respect, mingled with a desire to be loved and admired by such a true and noble soul, influenced her to softly murmur "yes." On her return her thoughts were too active to notice Edmund's note, which she had left in her hurry upon her dressing-table. Joseph went home in a state of ecstatic joy; he entered Miss Danton's cosey<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC5765-00000069"/> parlor, and actually kissed the old lady, much to her agitation and surprise; then patted her cheeks with his cold hands, and laughingly said that her boy could now play a good knife and fork.</p>
               <p>Miss Danton's face was wreathed in smiles, her dear old heart lost all its sad forebodings in the presence of his happy face. She stopped knitting, and removed her gold spectacles to wipe the moisture from her eyes.</p>
               <p>"You are always knitting," he said, and in a playful way he took up the stocking which she had laid down, and made a feint of pulling out the needles.</p>
               <p>"Don't, don't! it will take an evening to catch up the stitches, and that would be so much time lost."</p>
               <p>"I will ruin your work," he said. He made another feint, and then laid the sock down uninjured. This prank pleased Miss Danton exceedingly; he perceiving it, kissed her again, and whistling a lively air, went up to his apartment, where he settled himself down for a good night's study. Miss Danton composed herself, and resumed her knitting, but her mind was leading her into a discovery.</p>
               <p>"Politics! how absurd that I should have imagined that this was the cause of his loss of appetite and his unhappy demeanor. Why, I might have known a woman was at the bottom of it!"</p>

               <p>OF late Mr. DeWitt Stranford had made it a special duty to visit Dora's apartments during her absence; he had provided himself with a key that unlocked her escritoire, and was fully prepared to examine her correspondence. The events related in the last chapter gave him a golden opportunity. He searched, but found nothing that alarmed his suspicions. Restoring the packages and papers, which he had tossed topsy-turvy, to order, with a complacent smile, he closed the escritoire, tried the lid several times to make sure it was fast, and was about leaving the room with a cat-like tread, when his eyes rested upon Edmund's note. "How fortunate! what luck!" he chuckled; "here I was searching the private lock-up, and the document of my uneasiness lay in bold relief." Stranford<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC5765-00000070"/> straightened himself and gazed into the glass; his eyes possessed unusual cunning. He opened and perused the note several times; folded and replaced it in its former position. The glass reflected a different man from the crafty, foxy one, who, a few moments previous, had chuckled so knowingly. His cunning face wore a slight shade of remorse, and his little eyes seemed to twinkle with anxiety. DeWitt Stranford repeated incessantly one word, as he passed down the spacious staircase to the library. Mrs. Stranford, seated in her comfortable chair by the fire, which filled the apartment with a cheerful glow, had been enjoying one of her naps, which invariably produced a snore that sounded like the purr of a great tom-cat. Being awakened by the entrance of her husband, she yawned and prepared to resume her doze. But her better half did not take his usual seat; he paced the floor with a nervous step, and she found it impossible to return to the condition from which he had aroused her. When he had taken several turns, she remonstrated, by saying,</p>
               <p>"Please be seated, my dear; you annoy me."</p>
               <p>"Presently, my love."</p>
               <p>"You are not going to resume that horrid habit you gave up years ago?"</p>
               <p>"I have no intention of renewing it, my love."</p>
               <p>"Well, come to a standstill then."</p>
               <p>"By and by, my love."</p>
               <p>"DeWitt, what ails you, what possesses you to act with such disregard to my comfort?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing; business of importance requires deep reflection, and walking seems to aid me exceedingly, my love."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Stranford, if you don't appreciate my company sufficiently to grant this slight request, I will retire."</p>
               <p>"Very well; I do not wish to detain you, my love."</p>
               <p>"Always the way," cried Mrs. Stranford; everybody before me; never mind, DeWitt, I will remember this; do you hear, sir? I will remember this."</p>
               <p>"Yes, my love, I hear."</p>
               <p>"And I will teach you," she added with great emphasis, "I will teach you, DeWitt Stranford, to respect me, sir."</p>
               <p>"Thanks, thanks, many thanks, my love."</p>
               <p>During such tirades Mr. Stranford always managed to "keep the even tenor of his way," and his utter indifference almost drove his wife to distraction. She left the room, taking good care to slam the door as an indication of the anguish of her lacerated feelings. Mr. Stranford ceased his walking, and throwing himself into the easy chair which his partner had vacated, gazed into the glowing fire, and half breathed and muttered one short word—that word was a name, that name called him back long years in the past—called him like an echo from happy, youthful days, and pierced his cold and worldly heart. Remembrance brought a bright, loving face. It was Amy's: poor, trusting, forsaken Amy. He shuddered; it was only momentary; he<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC5765-00000071"/> arose to his feet and wiped the cold drops of sweat from his brow, then was himself again. He lit a cigar and reflected; Terence should work it up; if the Amy whom Dawn had sworn to protect had any connection with the Amy he knew of former years, he would soon ferret it out; but it couldn't be; there was no possibility of such an occurrence; he would banish such a ridiculous thought. He would investigate the matter; it might develop something in regard to Dawn. He didn't believe in such remarkable characters—so disinterested and philanthropic—as the note displayed; there was something more in all this than mere charity. "Ha!" he muttered, as he held his hands out to the warm fire and then rubbed them leisurely; "if this should be a cover, I will know it, and publish it to the world. It isn't the first time a man has taken home his own child in that way; but a mere name is a poor clue; I'll be patient; a few months will bring developments that will reveal all." The next morning Mrs. Stranford exhibited a slight sulkiness, with which she blended an injured air. He took no notice of her manner. During breakfast Dora was exceedingly talkative. Mr. Stranford made many efforts to draw her out in regard to Edmund's note, hoping that through her explanations he might obtain a link; but she proved to be as much bewildered as himself. Sadie interceded for a new dress—the required sum was only one thousand dollars. She could not think of going to the Waldy's reception without it; her extensive wardrobe had been exhibited; she hadn't a dress that had not been worn once; she desired something especially grand for the occasion. Mrs. Stranford lost her sulks, and also her injured air, and pleaded in Sadie's behalf. He drank his coffee, replied in monosyllables; then arose and said he would think about it. Sadie, ever persistent, followed him to the door, and after helping him on with his greatcoat, coaxed so urgently, that he partly assented to her wish. She clapped her little hands, kissed him several times, and called him a "dear, good pa," then laughingly bade him "good-morning." He went out in a happy mood, for her merry laugh went with him, and, for the time being, shut out from his mind the <choice>

               <p>MR. HENRY VAN VICKLE came from his barber's, where he had gone through his usual afternoon adornment, and sauntered up Broadway, working his hands into a pair of new kids of exquisite color. A fearful poke in the ribs almost threw him from his equilibrium; this salutation was accompanied by—</p>
               <p>"How are you, old boy? Give us your hand or I will blister you."</p>
               <p>"No, I thank you, Vinter," he responded, when he had regained his presence of mind; "you must excuse me for not appreciating your kind motive; but the pain, the excruciating pain, I can't endure it."</p>
               <p>"None of that, old boy; put out your paw, like a man; if any bones give way pick your doctor, and send the bill to me."</p>
               <p>"I would rather be denied the felicity of choosing a doctor."</p>
               <p>"Well, as you like it; either a grasp of the hand or a twist of the arm."</p>
               <p>Van Vickle had tested this twist of the arm, and fully appreciated the manner in which Vinter seized one by the elbow, and elevated it to a level with the ear; after some hesitation he concluded to proffer his hand; so, with some timidity, he pulled off the glove he had on, and received so hearty a welcome, that it distorted his face, and diffused a tingling sensation throughout his whole frame.</p>
               <p>"There, I will let you off easy this time; thank your stars that I insured you, or it would have been useless for you to attempt to put that glove on."</p>
               <p>"I don't doubt it," replied Van Vinkle, shaking and blowing his hand; "I don't doubt it, my dear fellow, not in the least."</p>
               <p>"If you do," laughed Vinter, "we will try it again."</p>
               <p>"I have no desire to avail myself of your kind intentions."</p>
               <p>"As you appear to be going my way, I will consider your company as a compromise."</p>
               <p>Much to the delight of Van Vickle, Vinter clasped his arm, and they proceeded up Broadway.</p>
               <p>"You will have to go to Jerry's with me, Van Vinkle; I take a lesson in self-defence and face-hashing this afternoon; come, old sport, say yes, or chew your tongue <choice>
                     <sic>befor</sic>
                     <corr>before</corr>
                  </choice> you rattle no; it won't do<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC5765-00000073"/> any good, if you make a no as big as an elephant; sacrifice yourself easy, young fellow, and don't put on such a mysterious face. I'll show you how a thoroughbred can handle the gloves."</p>
               <p>Van Vickle had a desire to see the wonderful Jerry, so he acceded to the wish of his obstinate companion. They bowed and nodded to various individuals; stopped twice or more to indulge in the essence of chain-lightning for the purpose of opening their eyes and hardening their muscles, and finally brought up in front of an old-fashioned, squatty building, its shattered blinds and broken eaves presenting a most dilapidated appearance. Vinter hammered the ancient knocker; the wonderful Jerry opened the door, and welcomed them with a smile that added an expression of deeper cruelty to his scarred face.</p>
               <p>"Walk in, gentlemen; happy to see you."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Daniels, my friend, Mr. Van Vickle."</p>
               <p>"Happy to make your acquaintance; hope you have concluded to perfect yourself in the art of self-defence."</p>
               <p>"Not at present, Mr. Daniels; simply came to see my friend Vinter use the gloves."</p>
               <p>"Oh!" responded the pugilist, "you have a treat, I can assure you; another quarter will make him one of the best amateurs in the city."</p>
               <p>This compliment, paid to Vinter's aptness, was said with a view of inducing that gentleman to continue his instructions another term, as the present one was about expiring. Such expressions had induced Vinter to continue month after month; but they were beginning to lose their effect; in this instance, in the presence of a friend, they accomplished the desired end. Vinter had prepared himself, and was waiting for his instructor to begin.</p>
               <p>"Now, sir," said Daniels, in a fierce tone, "mind your eyes;" and at it they went. Vinter parried the well-aimed blows, and danced around the room, first into the centre, then into a corner, then into the centre again, then down on one knee, then upon his feet, and round in a semi-circle; all of which evolutions resembled very much the antics of a cat when ridding itself of one of its numerous lives. By this time Vinter was puffing and blowing at a terrible rate; hostilities were suspended for a short interval.</p>
               <p>"Time!" cried the teacher, and directing him to act on the offensive, at it they went again. Vinter put every blow in with a zest. Daniels cried, "Well done; splendid action; quicker, if possible; that's it; that's the way. Now, then, look out for your smeller, sir;" and away went a well-directed poser toward Vinter's nose, which he parried in a scientific way, and saved that feature from adding variety to the scene by producing a copious flow of blood. Van Vickle viewed with complacence the manner in which his friend manœuvred, weighing in his mind the value of Vinter's acquaintance; if he should ever get into a street squabble, he sincerely hoped Vinter might be there. He admired the cool<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC5765-00000074"/> manner in which the pugilist parried Vinter's powerful blows; wondering how the victor of several combats could refrain from not retaliating a little. An hour or more was spent in this pleasant recreation, as Vinter termed it.</p>
               <p>The numerous compliments which Jerry Daniels heaped upon his pupil had the desired effect, before leaving, Vinter concluded to take another quarter, whereupon the instructor in the manly art explained to him the lowness of his purse, and pressing necessities, which demanded immediate attention. Mr. Vinter, with great magnanimity, offered to settle the pecuniary portion of the coming quarter. Mr. Daniels, with equal consideration, concluded to accept of the generous offer. Vinter paid the required amount, Mr. Daniels, with a complacent smile, booked him for another quarter. Vinter and Van Vickle were again sauntering up Broadway, staring into the various faces, which flirtation presents on this spacious thoroughfare.</p>

               <p>THE winter had been remarkably long and severe. Spring, in its ethereal mildness was never more welcome to the inhabitants of Mount Glibe. May, with its unfolding beauties, had receded into the past. Mountain sides and sequestered dales were robed in Nature's living green, reflecting on the soft blue sky the glories of Nature's god. Again the sweet songsters of the woodland thicket poured forth their carols; again the forest brooks murmured in the lonely dells. Creation had awakened to exultingly praise the ever-watchful Dispenser—the ever-loving God. In this paradise, little Amy was aroused to the realities of her<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC5765-00000075"/> changed life. Since her arrival at Mount Glibe, she had improved greatly in appearance; her hazel eyes danced with childish joy, the dimples in her round, laughing cheeks had grown deeper, and her flaxen hair, tossing in loose ringlets, added an irresistible coquettishness to her little dumpling form. She was not long in winning her way to all hearts; all loved her, and called her Fairy Queen, and her childish charms secured her the gratification of her slightest wishes. Her presence pervaded the old mansion with a laughing joy; her merry voice resounded through the spacious halls, and brightened the hitherto dull and gloomy rooms. The frowning tower, with its mantle of ivy, attracted her attention; while the dial of the warning time-piece excited her greatest wonder. Edmund became her instructor, and devoted the morning hours to her improvement. She was exceedingly apt, and learned rapidly. Sometimes, when her lesson was more than usually difficult, she pouted, and in childish peevishness slapped his hand, and called him her big, bad father. Taking her up he would kiss her tenderly, then the roguish look would steal back into her eyes, and she would return to her task with renewed earnestness. When he rode out with her, she persisted in driving Columbus. Occasionally he would indulge her, by placing her between his knees, and allowing her to take hold of the reins. When he laid upon the lounge, she would scramble up behind him and nestle her saucy little cheek against his. There was no end to their romps; every evening they took a tumble-toss, in which she would get twisted and rolled about like a lump of dough. What a merry laugh she had, what an exciting shriek, when he threw her up in the air, and caught her in his strong arms, to receive an extra squeeze and half a dozen kisses. This romping play did not make her boisterous; she desisted when he stopped, and taking a seat near him, would gaze lovingly into his eyes. A firm friendship had grown up between her and old Abraham. At milking time he searched for the cattle in a happy glee, if "Pumpkin Pet," as he called her, was seated upon his broad shoulders; he would shake his old sides with laughter, when she in ecstasy clapped her tiny hands and declared she heard old Brindle's tinkling bell. The <choice>

Carlo came in for his share of devotion; he never remained indoors when she was out; he appeared delighted in her presence, and was her constant companion. Rebecca, the housemaid, and Phebe, the waitress, eagerly vied with each other in their efforts to gain the largest share of the little favorite's affection; and but for the wise provision of Mrs. Dawn, that each should have alternate nights in putting Amy to bed, they would probably have ended the dispute in open hostility. Such was the<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC5765-00000076"/> change this lovely child had wrought, turning the dreary apathy and monotony of a country life into pleasant activity and enjoyment.</p>

               <p>HOW good and kind of you, dear Aunt Betty, to so cheerfully desert your home duties, and take care of mine. It is adding to the debt of gratitude which I shall never be able to pay," said Mrs. Dawn.</p>
               <p>"La, don't talk in that way, child; it is the delight of my heart to serve you. Home affairs may get topsy-turvy, but, la! bless you, that's nothing; Ben don't care a whip of his thumb, and I shan't be there to witness the show. Don't worry about my affairs, I won't return to Markland until you are better; so stop worrying, child, about what you cannot change, and be reconciled." Aunt Betty went into the kitchen, and baring her arms, she<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC5765-00000077"/> busied herself in producing one of her rarities in the shape of an old-fashioned pot-pie.</p>
               <p>Aunt Betty was one of those remarkable women who are seldom found, except in New England. She was something of an oddity, but with all her peculiarities, she was a house-wife that filled the inner man with gladness; her pies and pickles left a lasting impression; linen under her supervision was bleached into a whiteness that vied with the purest snow. Her regulations were exact; the rules which she had formed for the duties of each day could not be abridged or improved. She was tall and rigid in figure, and although upward of sixty, was as agile as a girl of twenty. Her masculine face expressed more than ordinary good nature, and a firm adherence to right. Such was the individual who had taken the keys and assumed the supremacy at Mount Glibe. Mrs. Dawn was the last woman to seek idle indulgence; she reluctantly gave up; she fought against the painful necessity as long as her strength permitted, but after being warned and coaxed by Dr. Miller and Edmund, she was obliged to surrender. The cold which she had contracted in the winter was making dreadful havoc; the most strenuous efforts on the part of the doctor had not succeeded in allaying it; her strength had gradually wasted, it became of vital importance that she should give up household cares. A few evenings after Aunt Betty's arrival, Mrs. Dawn was seated upon the front porch; Amy had cunningly nestled her head of flaxen locks in her lap, while Mrs. Dawn gently patted her cheek and twisted her hair. Mrs. Dawn appreciated the beauty and solemnity of the hour. Twilight, bearing in its fading softness tributes of floral perfume, brought the vesper praises of the forest choirs. The depths of her soul went forth in loving humility and fervent prayer. The twilight receded before the gathering darkness, and bore to the throne of heaven its incense, song, and prayer. Sombre night was now supreme; reverie went back to childhood; year after year marched in review, bearing their banners of joy and sorrow, temptation and triumphs. The procession halted; and recognition threw a bright lustre down the vista of time. Retrospection brought back soft whispers and loved faces of the departed. The past went, the present came, with its wearied aspect and fearful awakenings; a slight tremor, an inward groan, and then a submissive sob. "'Thy will be done.' Dear Edmund, how can he bear it? Oh! God, strengthen him; give him resignation to bow under the blow. How I tremble, poor, miserable creature that I am." The tears flowed down her cheeks, and she sought not to repress them.</p>
               <p>"There is my star, there is my star," cried Amy; and jumping up, she clapped her hands, and gave a merry laugh that shook her little dumpling form; "Oh! you beautiful star. That is Grandma Ray<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC5765-00000078"/> watching me; she said she would, and she always keeps her promise."</p>
               <p>"By and by little Amy will have another star," said Mrs. Dawn.</p>
               <p>"I don't want another," replied the child.</p>
               <p>"You don't want Grandma Dawn's star to watch you?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! yes," replied Amy, excitedly; "I want your star here, not in the blue sky; here, where I can kiss and love it; why, Grandma Dawn, you are crying." She climbed into Mrs. Dawn's lap, folded <choice>

                     <corr>her</corr>
                  </choice> plump arms around her neck, and kissed her many times. "Don't cry, grandma, don't; Amy will be good to-morrow, she loves you better than Phebe, or Rhoda, or Abraham or Aunt Betty; she loves you better than anybody in the world, except her big, naughty pa, who makes her learn such horrid lessons."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dawn pressed Amy to her heart. The clattering gallop of a horse upon the broad, winding drive that approached the mansion, caused Mrs. Dawn to calm her emotions and dry her tears. Edmund dismounted, and handed the bridle to Abraham; Amy rushed forward to welcome him. He caught her in his arms, kissed her, called her his little cherub, and putting her down embraced his mother. Edmund had been absent for several days, business requiring his presence at the county-seat, where he had visited prominent lawyer. That evening, after Amy had said her prayers and kissed Mrs. Dawn, she went to Edmund, putting up her arms coquettishly, drew his head down, and in an exceedingly confidential whisper, told him that Grandma Dawn had been crying; she then kissed him, and went off with Phebe to bed. The child's manner sank into his heart; he took a book, made a pretence of reading, but his eyes wandered from the page; he tried to scrutinize his mother's face, without being observed. Mrs. Dawn was crocheting; she continued her work, not perceiving his stolen glances. After awhile she pleaded weariness, and bidding him an affectionate good-night, left him to his own reflections. He arose and paced the floor in great dejection. In that quiet, patient face he read something that alarmed him, something that impressed him with dreadful forebodings, and awakened keen anguish in the depths of his soul. The calm resignation, the hectic flush, the gentle lustre of the eye, warned him and added to his fears.</p>

               <p>THERE, Mr. Joseph Bosway, what do you think of my decoration," said Dora, with a smile, at the same time placing her hat, around which she had woven a wreath of oak leaves, upon her head.</p>
               <p>"You are a witch," replied Joseph, playfully.</p>
               <p>"Why, Joseph Bosway, have you, above all others, the audacity to brand me with that appellation? I thought better of you than that," and she broke out into a gleeful laugh.</p>
               <p>You did think better of me, did you? I am sorry, but it does not influence me in the least to alter my opinion; you are a pleasing witch. I'll tell you why: This wreath was of your own choosing; you appreciated the contrast between the dark leaves and your golden hair, which being somewhat disarranged by our wild and bough-obstructed walk, could not have been better prepared for the ornamentation which you have so artistically and tastefully interwoven."</p>
               <p>"Really, sir," interrupted Dora, with an assumed displeasure, "your criticism is entirely uncalled for."</p>
               <p>"I was trying to explain why you are a witch," continued Joseph, not the least abashed by Dora's interruption. "Dora—I mean Miss Elveston—" he hesitated for a moment, then, looking into her eyes, continued: "Ever since the eventful sleigh-ride which we took last winter, and which you undoubtedly remember, you have in the most bewitching manner managed, until this present hour, to prevent me from having a private interview. We had an understanding on that evening; I still consider it sacred. You may have changed your mind; if so, now is the opportunity to retract." He paused for her answer, but she remained motionless, with her eyes cast down upon the soft carpet of green moss. Much agitated, he continued:</p>
               <p>"Dear Dora, speak, I beseech of you. Answer; shall I look upon you as my affianced, or must I forever give you up?"</p>
               <p>She raised her eyes to his; though bedimmed with tears, in their gentleness he read his fate. Taking from his vest pocket a diamond ring, he raised her hand, and placed it upon the engagement finger.</p>
               <p>"Will you wear this as the emblem of our betrothal?"</p>
               <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC5765-00000080"/>
               <p>She faintly assented. He folded her tenderly in his arms, and stole from her ruby lips a kiss. It was Joseph Bosway's first kiss, the first he had ever in his recollection bestowed upon any human being. His happiness was complete. There was no shadow or sorrow now; he no longer felt the sting of an unknown parentage. The queenly beauty whom he had worshipped for years—the idol of his heart—was his betrothed—his future bride. He trembled with emotion, but it was only momentary. His eyes wore a brilliant lustre; from each feature of his handsome face was banished every foreboding; a radiant happiness had changed his whole appearance.</p>
               <p>Dora had consented more through pity than love. Her sisterly sympathy for Joseph had absorbed her to such an extent, that, like many others, she misinterpreted it for love. However, she was content, and being content she was happy. A ringing, merry laugh rang through the old pine grove. They looked up from whence it came, and discovered Sadie Stranford seated upon an elevated moss-covered rock. Behind her stood the ever-valiant Van Vickle.</p>
               <p>"Come up here, Dora, do," cried Sadie, clapping her hands. "I want you to see how nice it is. Make her come, Mr. Bosway."</p>
               <p>Dora and Joseph were somewhat embarrassed by Sadie's sudden appearance. However, they complied with her wishes, and were soon on the rock.</p>
               <p>"Here, Dora, sit down; here is a mossy cushion," said Sadie, as she pushed her plump little white hand into the folds of luxuriant rock-moss. "My, how becomingly you are decorated; I suppose Mr. Bosway aided you. Don't blush, although confession in any form is good for the soul. There, I won't tease you any more. You are just in time for the show. Here is my valiant knight, who boasted that he could climb like a cat. There is a majestic pine; come, Mr. Van Vickle, prepare for the ascent, or I shall conclude that you are a vain braggart."</p>
               <p>"I hope that you will not insist, Miss Stranford, for really I am not in condition for such an undertaking."</p>
               <p>"Excuse you! Why, you know you can't climb; if you could you would soon commence the feat to reach the lower limb of that sturdy pine."</p>
               <p>"It is not fair to place me in such a plight."</p>
               <p>"Then do your duty like a man."</p>
               <p>"Do you really desire to have the exhibition begin?"</p>
               <p>"Most decidedly I do; and if I did not wish it you would not persist in declining, you horrid, obstinate, mean creature!" she gave him a whimsical, vexatious look, and he immediately prepared to comply with her wish.</p>
               <p>"Is this the tree?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," she replied, with a mischievous triumph in her eye.</p>
               <p>Van Vickle put his hands upon the solid old monarch<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC5765-00000081"/> arch who had braved the storms of centuries, and looked up to the branch, the designated goal, about thirty feet above. He was fully aroused; he must make the attempt, even if he failed. He threw his arms and legs about the huge trunk, and commenced slowly to ascend. Every inch that he gained was a desperate struggle; the attraction of gravitation grew stronger every moment, while his strength was fast diminishing. A few feet more would achieve success. Another desperate effort brought him triumph.</p>
               <p>"Bravo!" shouted Sadie. "Bravo! my most valiant knight. You have risen considerably in my estimation. Come down and receive your reward—your wreath of glory."</p>
               <p>There was no necessity to command Mr. Van Vickle to descend. He was soon on the ground, but presented a sorry sight. His garments were besmeared with pitch and green wood-damp; he was in a comical plight. The woods rang with Sadie's merriment. Dora and Joseph could not refrain from joining. Van Vickle concluded that he did not care about his wreath of glory; the only reward he thought of was the hotel, and a change of clothing. When the merriment had subsided, Joseph, at Dora's request, sought Van Vickle, for the purpose of making an ample apology. Sadie calmed herself, and giving Dora a searching look, said:</p>
               <p>"How is it that you and Mr. Bosway absented yourselves so soon after breakfast? I had Van Vickle and the Major looking for you in every direction."</p>
               <p>"Because we chose to have a quiet walk, for a purpose which concerned us only," responded Dora, coolly.</p>
               <p>"I should say so; the termination must have been delightful. I saw him kiss you."</p>
               <p>Dora sought no further concealment. She laid her hand in Sadie's. The ring told the tale. Sadie placed her arm around Dora's waist, and drawing her close, kissed her, and congratulated her warmly. She sought to learn the history of their morning's stroll, but Dora positively declined to relate a single sentence. She then contented herself by examining the ring; compared it with Van Vickle's, and concluded that Dora's was more brilliant.</p>
               <p>"Oh, dear!" she sighed. "I shall be glad when next week comes."</p>
               <p>"Why?"</p>
               <p>"Because Van Vickle is going to the city for a week or more; you see, then I can walk out in the woods with the Major, and I will act so cunningly that he will give me a ring."</p>
               <p>"Why, Sadie, would you engage yourself for the sake of a ring?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know," was the response. "Any way, I would do a heavy amount of flirting for a handsome diamond."</p>
               <p>"Sadie Stranford, how can you talk so? It is<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC5765-00000082"/> terribly wicked. The diamond would be poor compensation. You must have some feeling; you surely would not be so cruel!"</p>
               <p>"Do not call fun cruelty. Why, that is all men are good for."</p>
               <p>"You will think differently some day."</p>
               <p>"Maybe I shall, but I hope not. I think these love-sick women are horrid. Say I loved Henry Van Vickle; that would be the end of Sadie Stranford's fun. But, on the contrary, not loving him, and making him think I do, I have an abject slave, who serves me uncomplainingly. This same Henry Van Vickle, although unconscious of it, has often made me the belle of a ball-room. For instance, at Mrs. Sydney's, last winter, his jealousy and flurry, with but slight encouragement on my part, brought the gentlemen as thick around me as bees about a hive. All the beaux require is a little encouragement, a 'soft' of their own sex to torment, and they will humbly kneel at your feet."</p>
               <p>"You heartless creature," cried Dora; "I won't encourage you by listening to such talk."</p>
               <p>"Poor, dear cousin," retorted Sadie, with a smile. "She is so tender-hearted! Here comes Josie; run and meet him like a pet spaniel, that's a good girl."</p>
               <p>"Sadie Stranford, what possesses you? Have you gone mad?"</p>
               <p>"If so, you had better run, for I might bite Josie's spaniel." She broke out into a gleeful laugh. Joseph, by this time having approached rather near, remarked that she had better save some of her merriment to pacify the gallant Van Vickle.</p>
               <p>"Is he really provoked?" asked Dora.</p>
               <p>"I don't care if he is," rejoined Sadie.</p>
               <p>"No, he is not provoked, but feels rather grieved that his stunning, irresistible suit is destroyed. Miss Sadie will have to console him. The mail having just arrived, I took the liberty of bringing you this letter, Miss Elveston. It appears by the postmark to be from Mount Glibe."</p>
               <p>It was from Edmund Dawn, relating in the briefest manner the critical condition of his mother. Before finishing its perusal, Dora resolved to go at once; she handed the letter to Joseph, who read it, then looked inquiringly into her face. After a long silence, during which she betrayed the intensity of her emotion, she said:</p>
               <p>"I must go. I must start this very day. I must take the next stage that goes down the mountain."</p>
               <p>"I will accompany you, Miss Elveston, as far as New York," said Joseph.</p>
               <p>"But, Dora, our summer-party; you surely won't desert us, you will ruin our pleasure. If you and Mr. Bosway go, it will make an odd couple, you know how detestable that is in travelling. I declare it is too bad. Only one week from home, too, and all the prospect of enjoyment destroyed."</p>
               <p>"Don't complain, Sadie," responded Dora. "I must and will go to Mount Glibe."</p>
               <p>That evening Mr. Bosway and Dora were upon<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC5765-00000083"/> the steamer bound from Catskill to New York. It was one of those clear, beautiful evenings which deck night in her most bewitching garb. They remained on the deck until almost midnight; Joseph was considerate, he knew the agitation and alarm that oppressed her; he sought only to console her. He did not allude to their engagement, though his heart beat fast, and he longed to manifest his exuberant joy. He had learned through a long school of adversity to be patient, and his manhood dictated forbearance. The next day when he had seen to her baggage, and aided her to a seat in the cars, he waited for the starting signal, then pressed her hand, and bade her good-by.</p>
               <p>"God bless you," she murmured; "your consideration is only surpassed by your kindness."</p>

               <p>DORA'S journey to Mount Glibe was not an eventful one; it was late in the afternoon when she arrived. Aunt Betsey met her at the door, and conducted her to the same apartment she had occupied during her last visit. Dora did not inquire about Mrs. Dawn's condition; her apprehensions, and Aunt Betsey's manner restrained her. When Aunt Betsey had closed the door and taken a general survey of the apartment, she said in a faltering voice:</p>
               <p>"I hope, Miss Elveston, that you will exert every effort to control your feelings, and refrain from exhibiting alarm or anxiety during your stay in Mrs. Dawn's apartment."</p>
               <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC5765-00000084"/>
               <p>"Is it possible," replied Dora, with great emotion, "that she is so low? why was I not informed before?"</p>
               <p>"Because this serious change has taken place within a few days. We all had hopes that each hour would bring some token of improvement; we did not wish to give you any unnecessary alarm—"</p>
               <p>"Therefore you waited," interrupted Dora. "How could you be so cruel?"</p>
               <p>"Be calm, Miss Elveston, control your emotion; the sick read every feature, and notice every sign of alarm in the faces of their friends." With this advice, begging to be excused as she might be wanted, she left the apartment.</p>
               <p>Dora, left to her own reflections, was overcome by her emotions, and gave way to a flood of tears. She felt a premonition that something dreadful was going to happen; she made several attempts to hush her sobs, but each effort resulted in a renewed burst of tears. An hour or more had passed, and still she wept. A gentle tap upon her door aroused her to action; she calmed herself, wiped away her tears, arose, and opening the door, looked up into the face of Edmund Dawn. The pain portrayed in each feature, his pallid whiteness, his calm demeanor, told her but too plainly how his great and noble heart suffered. He extended his hand, and led her without a word to the chamber of sickness. On entering, she was startled by the changed appearance of Mrs. Dawn. She went to the bedside and looked down upon the wasted form; then bending over, she kissed the poor, bloodless lips, and took into her warm clasp the cold, emaciated hands of the sufferer; her heart uttered an inward cry of pain. She was not recognized; Mrs. Dawn was unconscious. Oh! what a dreadful moment for poor Dora; her form became rigid, she whispered almost unconsciously to herself, "Too late, too late." At this juncture Doctor Miller retired to the adjoining room; Edmund took a seat near the bed. Aunt Betty was seated at the foot. Amy crept out from the corner, in which she had remained, unperceived, sobbing for hours, and going to Edmund, climbed into his lap, then threw her arms around him. The servants were in an adjoining apartment. A dreadful stillness settled upon them, which was only broken by the heavy breathing of the sufferer. Presently a change came; consciousness returned; the heretofore closed eyes opened, their brilliancy seemed to illuminate the room. Dora was noticed, and kneeling down, received an affectionate embrace.</p>
               <p>"Do you love me, Dora?" was uttered in a gentle whisper.</p>
               <p>"With all my heart."</p>
               <p>"Then I will ask a favor of you; promise me that you will always be a sister to poor Edmund, that you will not leave him to grieve alone when I am gone."</p>
               <p>"I do promise," cried Dora fervently.</p>
               <pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC5765-00000085"/>
               <p>"God bless you—God bless you." Drawing Dora down, she kissed her many times. She then spoke endearingly to Aunt Betsey, mentioned kindly each one of the servants, expressing a hope that they might live better and purer lives, requested Amy to be placed upon the bed beside her, and kissed her. Then turning her gaze upon Edmund, she said:</p>
               <p>"Poor, dear Edmund, my poor, dear boy, how can you survive this blow?"</p>
               <p>He knelt by the side of Dora, the sufferer folded her arms with tender love around them; she ceased speaking that she might gather more strength. Amy softly stroked her brow. Soon after she began again in a weaker voice; she would not exact any promise of Edmund; he knew her wishes, and should exert his manhood to fulfil them; she paused for breath, then continued in a still fainter voice; there was one thing which she desired to impress upon them; it had been her motto, ever since Edmund, at the temperance lecture, had made those eloquent remarks. "Ever forgive, dear Edmund and Dora, ever forgive. This, and love for Christ our precious Saviour, is the fountain, the all, of earthly happiness. Ever forgive, as you expect to be forgiven." There was another pause; when she resumed, it was in a soft whisper. She was forgiven; she, one of the lost, was redeemed; the Saviour was near her; she had no fear of the dark valley of death; the love she bore for Christ would light and cheer her—this night she would sup with her Lord in Paradise—she could hear the angelic host of heaven sing—she would soon be in that celestial city, where pain and care are no more, where the weary enter everlasting rest. Her mansion was prepared, her heavenly crown of glory was in her Saviour's hands; she could wait no longer, she would go to receive it, with the assurance of welcome—"Well done, good and faithful servant, enter into the joy of thy Lord." She ceased whispering, her breath came thick and fast. She drew them closer, then heaved a long sigh—no distortion of the body, no contraction of the muscles. A momentary silence, in which Dora's hot tears flowed on Edmund's pallid cheek.</p>
               <p>"Dead!" said Edmund, as he lifted his head and kissed the hushed lips. "Dead! dead!" He then arose and left the room.</p>
               <p>Dora, no longer restraining her emotion, kissing the remains, called in the most endearing terms upon her friend to come back, and not leave her in her loneliness. Mingling with her moans was the wailing of Aunt Betsey and the servants, whilst little Amy, crying piteously, ran after Edmund.</p>
               <p>Hours had passed, and all was quiet about the Homestead; the windows of the chamber in which lay the remains of Mrs. Dawn were opened. The sad, gentle wind of twilight, which wafted back the soft, delicate curtains, seemed to sing dirges in the<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC5765-00000086"/> forest pines, mournfully rustled through the aged oaks, and tossed in a weeping sway the drooping branches of the willow. The news of Mrs. Dawn's death had spread throughout Mount Glibe and the vicinity; the same sad wind entered every house, in many a lonely abode whispered sympathy to the weeping occupants. Good deeds were the emblems of her life; charity, with its bright, effulgent lustre, would enshrine her sacred memory. Many a heart sought rest that night with its bereavement, conscious that it had lost its truest and most worthy friend. Young and old, rich and poor, widows and orphans, all realized the incalculable loss of her endearing presence. Early the next day, while the sweet songsters were pouring forth their morning praise, they came with their tokens of love; some with luxuriant buds of the greenhouse, arranged tastefully in wreaths and crosses; some with the humble blossoms of the cottage garden, clustered in well-proportioned bouquets; and some with the wild flowers of the forest, loose and unarranged—beautiful tributes, coming from the hands of the poor and needy. How good and kind of a merciful Father, in giving to the poor, as well as to the rich, flowers—emblems of heavenly purity. They placed their floral offerings in the chamber of the dead, bedewing them with their tears. Edmund and Dora were moved by the gratitude and love which the humble and lowly of Mount Glibe evinced. All these endearments ments of the neighbors made Edmund realize, more and more, the dearness of his mother, and his irreparable loss. He and Dora were constantly with the remains, gazing by the hour upon the emaciated face, portraying its long suffering; but still in its cold death-cast retaining gentle patience and meek resignation to the will of "Him who designs for all." How different the manifestation of their affliction; she pouring forth her grief in tears, he grave, immovable, and pale as marble; she the soft, loving, tender woman, he the resolute, lion-hearted man; but how deeply the blow sunk into their hearts no one but God could tell. Sunday, the day appointed for the funeral, brought to Mount Glibe more than usual quiet; the day appeared to be clad in a deep holiness. Every inhabitant felt the solemnity of the occasion. Afternoon came, with it the funeral cortége. There were no vehicles in the procession; the remains were borne from the house to the Old Stone Church by those who deemed it their duty and privilege to pay the most marked respect to the departed. Rich and poor, young and old, with drooping heads and eyes suffused with tears, followed in the funeral train. The deep-toned bell in the Old Stone Church rang forth its saddest strain—all Nature wore a sympathetic appearance. The services were read, the prayers said, the box lowered—an interval of silence broken by the steady fall of earth—then<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC5765-00000087"/> a mound; and the vast assemblage sorrowfully and slowly dispersed, some carrying in their hearts a new-made grave which would remain until life's end.</p>

               <p>"You don't deserve it, don't you; well, that is good. Look here, May Greenly, if you don't turn over a new leaf, and stop putting on such d— airs, I'll teach you better manners; do you hear?"</p>
               <p>"Jacob Vinter, what do you mean by this overbearing conduct?"</p>
               <p>"That." And he slapped her severely across the face.</p>
               <p>"You brute," she cried, in a towering rage; "am I to be treated like a dog?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and even worse; you are nothing to me."</p>
               <p>"This is your lasting affection, this is your eternal devotion. Oh! fool that I was to trust you. Why<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC5765-00000088"/> did I ever allow you to tempt me from the path of virtue—just retribution."</p>
               <p>"Here, no more of that. Any one to hear you gab would think you were my wife."</p>
               <p>"Am I not as sacred? you have often told me so."</p>
               <p>"That was only talk; woman, are you crazy? You as sacred as a wife? Humph! you who have given up your purity!"</p>
               <p>"It was you," she interrupted savagely, "who robbed me of it; you, with your false promises and wicked deceptions; no one else but you, Jacob Vinter."</p>
               <p>"You insolent d—liar," he cried, rushing at her, and in his maddened fury he would have knocked her down, if she had not, by her agility, evaded the intended blow. He spat at her, called her "an infernal she-devil;" slammed the door, glided down the stairs, and was soon in the street.</p>
               <p>May paced the room; the most revengeful feelings filled her soul, urging her to crimes of hideous nature. She would pay him for this; she would make him rue it all the days of his life. She would disfigure him—she would do worse—she would take his life. What cared she for the prison; she had no fear of the gallows—it would end her wretchedness. A wild fire of desperation gleamed from her now unearthly eyes—she had decided upon the manner in which he should die; poison administered istered in his drink; in this way she might escape detection. She would procure the drug and poison his liquor this very night when he returned in his usual state of drunkenness. He would drink her hate and his own damnation. "Ah! Jacob Vinter, you who won my love, then deluded and deceived me, little dreamed that the poor, half-clad sewing girl, whom you tempted with your soothing lies, whom you influenced to desert her baby child, would gloat over being your assassin.—Oh! my baby, my poor baby;" she sank down upon the lounge, her pale, rigid features relaxed from their firmness and were softened by her grief. She was no longer the desperate woman, but the dejected mother; everything that was tender and loving came to her now. She rubbed her throbbing temples with her hands, and wished that she could die; then her spirit rebelled, became resolute at such a thought; she would be more of a heroine, not a poor, miserable, fainting woman; she would seek and find her child. She wept, the weeping changed her—changed her heart from revenge to forgiveness. She understood his motive; he wished to rid himself of her, she would go; she would remain no longer to annoy him. Go? where could she go? She knew not, cared not; anywhere rather than to live where her presence was so obnoxious. She would seek employment, some honorable means of obtaining a livelihood, her departure should be immediate, she would take nothing that did not fairly and<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC5765-00000089"/> justly belong to her; she would leave his costly gifts, she would take nothing but one suit, one change of clothing. Her preparations being completed, she left a short note stating her reasons for departing, and also expressing her forgiveness.</p>
               <p>The evening found her a wanderer and an outcast. She walked rapidly for some time; then paused in front of an old dilapidated building, and entering, climbed up a rickety stairway to the attic. She knocked, and knocked again, but no sound answered her summons. With trembling fingers she raised the latch and opened the door. A cold, chilling darkness pervaded the room, and proved her only welcome. She closed the door, crept down the creaking stairs, her heart giving way to the wildest emotions and deepest grief; at the entrance she met a woman of whom she learned that death had been in the garret. Her brain reeled, she leaned for support against the doorway. She nerved herself, and said tremulously,</p>
               <p>"The child, oh! where is the child?"</p>
               <p>"Taken away by a kind-hearted gentleman, who is able to give her a home, and bring her up like a lady."</p>
               <p>"Thank God," she muttered; "his name, do you know his name?"</p>
               <p>"I have his directions on a bit of paper, me honey; if ye will come up to me room I will show it ye." They went, and when Mrs. Malloy had struck a light she fumbled in the drawer of an old cupboard and produced the desired paper. May seized it with trembling hands, read it, and gave a shriek of joy; then stood like a statue, faint and speechless, then broke out into an ecstatic laugh, thanked Mrs. Malloy, and went out quickly into the night. Her heart beat high with happiness, her forsaken child was protected and provided for by Edmund Dawn. She cared not whither her steps led; she walked block after block rapt in her joyous discovery. It was late, very late before she became roused from her reverie to the necessities of her position. She had met with no friendly adventure, the station-house was the only lodging that she could obtain. She sought its hospitality, and on its hard bed of charity had a sweeter repose than she had enjoyed for years.</p>

               <p>ELSIE was up bright and early the next morning, and throughout the day made every exertion to obtain employment, but without success. They all made the same excuse, asked the same questions in regard to her recommendations, and how long she had lived in the last place, none of which she could answer. No one took compassion on the poor girl, except to give her an occasional pittance. Night found her again in the station-house. So matters continued for several days, during which she suffered greatly; still she had no prospect of employment. What should she do? She could not starve in the streets; she had been warned, if she continued to seek lodgings in the station-house, she would be arraigned for vagrancy and sent to Blackwell's Island. She knew of no place except home; would she dare return, after so long an absence? Probably she was forgotten. No, she could not, would not, go home. She wandered across the city, and went out on one of the great piers. The busy bustle of the day was hushed in the quiet shades of evening. In her loneliness, in her utter misery, she cast her eyes upon the blue, rippling water, then raised them to the opposite shore, whose sloping bank, in the lingering rays of the setting sun, loomed up as a bright haven of rest. She sat there for a long time, quiet and motionless; the last rays of light had gone; the opposite bank had faded from her vision; nothing but darkness and the murmuring water were near her now. She shuddered; she quaked with inward fear. Only a jump, only a splash in the cool, placid water; all would be over then. Husband and child would never know of her untimely end. Better dead than live to cause them shame. She closed her eyes and clasped her hands. One resolute step—Oh God! she could not die! She turned her eyes, full of terror, to the canopy of heaven; the soft starlight melted them to tears; she crouched down and sobbed bitterly. By and by she overcame her emotions, and again looked heavenward. A serenity crept into her poor bleeding heart, the twinkling emblems of a Father's love comforted and consoled her. Wearied and exhausted, they hushed her into a sleep; in that sleep a child's voice called her back to her girlhood's home. The<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC5765-00000091"/> largest and brightest star of all came, and with its golden beams made a radiant path for her across the turbulent river, to the Elysian fields on the opposite shore.</p>
               <p>The next day she went into the cold and cruel world; but the dream went with her, filling her heart with fortitude and joy. Yes, she would go home, even to be rejected; she could die happy there, amid the green fields and wild flowers. Probably when her story was told she would be forgiven. But how could she go without means? To whom could she apply? She stopped in front of a handsome mansion, then ascended its lofty stoop. She inquired for the lady of the house, and received a severe rebuff from an Irish servant.</p>
               <p>"Do ye think that me lady is at the beck and call of the likes of ye? I'm sure ye should larn manners, and go to the basement door, where ye belong, and not come ringing folks' bells that are above ye!"</p>
               <p>"What does she want, Bridget?" said a soft voice within.</p>
               <p>"Go down to the basement, where you belong!" said the irritated domestic, without heeding her mistress's call.</p>
               <p>"I don't want to talk to you," responded May, warmly. "I desire to see your betters." Pushing past her, she stood on the threshold of the apartment from which came the sweet voice of authority. A delicate young woman looked blushingly ly into her face. She related briefly her utter poverty and want, ending with an appeal for means to take her home. The Irish servant interrupted her several times with uncouth expressions, but she continued, without replying to her cruel assertions.</p>
               <p>"Don't believe the low-lived creetur; sure it's the likes of her that rob yer houses. For shame! a big, able-bodied girl like her begging. Sure ye know that it is her own wickedness that has brought her to all of this. Hunt her out of the house, miss, she's too foul for yer sight."</p>
               <p>"Go down-stairs, Bridget, and attend to your duties," said an old gentleman in a commanding tone. He sat on one corner of a huge sofa, and had seemed quite indifferent to the conversation.</p>
               <p>"Young woman," he continued, "I don't doubt your veracity; but I have been imposed upon so much, that I hardly know whether I am doing a good or bad action."</p>
               <p>"Remember your failing, pa," said the delicate young woman. "You are too credulous; you had better save your money for some cause you are sure is worthy of aid."</p>
               <p>"You may be right, my dear; but if I am deceived, I can't help it." After a nervous fumble in all of his pockets, he produced the required amount, and handed it to May. She bent over and kissed his hand. Turning his head, he waved her with a slow motion of his hand out of the apartment;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC5765-00000092"/> then wiped a tear or two from his old eyes, muttering something about the cold-heartedness of the world.</p>
               <p>She was on her way home. How her head reels! She was almost there; every moment seemed hours now. The whistle shrieks—the train slackens—stops! Filled with emotion she steps off on the platform. She trembles lest some one should recognize her, but it is not likely; it is too dark. The train is gone; the station is deserted. She will wait a moment, to calm herself, to reflect. There, now, her courage has returned. She will not take the road; she will go over the hills, through the dell; she don't mind the darkness, she is familiar with every inch of the path; she is nearing the abode, the home of her childhood, where she has spent so many happy hours; her heart beats high with hope; she stops; she only has to round that bluff, then she can see the dear old house; she proceeds; the bluff is passed. But—"Great God!" she exclaims; "is this the end of my dream? the end of my happy home?" and she sinks down, broken-hearted, by the charred remains of old Aunty Fawn's cot.</p>

               <p>I MAY GREENLY no longer, but poor, forsaken, ruined Elsie Olcot; yes, the same Elsie that was once so bright and happy. Great God! What a change! She shuddered as she compared the joyous recollections of the past with her present condition and prospects. Still in all her gloom, as she sat by her ruined home, the poor wretched girl had one more hope, and that was Edmund's forgiveness. She remained by the ruins, silent and motionless, all night, pondering over the days in which they had wandered, sung, and read together. She thought of his jealousy, of his insisting upon secretly marrying her; and when he knew her condition, that she was shortly to become a mother, how he neglected her and did not answer any of her appeals. At first she resolved to throw off the mask, and declare herself openly as his wife;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC5765-00000093"/> then she concluded she would suffer anything, even death, rather than breathe their secret. She would not claim him, she would leave it to his honor to do her justice. Then she thought she would seek him amid his classical studies in Old Yale. She would appeal to him for her unborn babe. Then she became morbid; he had forsaken her; she would trouble him no more; she would go away to the great city of New York, she would get employment and care for herself and her babe. He should never find her. Providence would deal severely with him for the cruelty with which he had treated her. "Oh! fatal step," she groaned, "that I ever left my home. Oh! if I only had had some one to advise me, I should not have fallen; I should not have been the prey, like many others, of the vile and wicked that inhabit New York. I will go with the morning light to the Dawn mansion. He will forgive me when I tell him my sufferings and anguish. I will not seek to be recognized as his wife—simply to be aided to live a good, virtuous life."</p>
               <p>The gray morn came and conquered night, and in its mystic light Elsie Olcot arose from her seat by the ruins of the old cot, and commenced her walk. She stopped to cull many a wild rose, bedecked with its dewy gems. The woods rang with music, lovely birds poured forth their sweetest songs of sympathy. She preferred the rugged path to the road—the path that lay over hills and dales, through forest thicket and level plain. She passed many spots which she remembered fondly. At each she paused, while some childish freak or girlish joy awakened her reflections, absorbing her to such an extent that it was noon when she came in sight of Edmund's homestead. She lingered in a shady grove of pines that lay adjacent to the road, through which ran a romping, sparkling brook. This was the dearest spot of all. She threw herself down on the moss-covered ground, and listening to the murmuring waters, called back many happy hours that she had spent there with Edmund. She remained for an hour or more in reverie over the past, from which she was aroused by the approach of horses that came slowly cantering up the road. She arose, so that she would be concealed by the underbrush, and have a perfect view of the riders as they passed. They were Dora and Edmund. She uttered a groan, then fell cold and lifeless on the ground.</p>
               <p>"Now, Uncle Abraham, why don't you run? You ain't half so nice as you used to be; I shan't help you any more to look for old Brindle with the bell. You know I always hear the tinkling first. Come, Uncle Abraham, if you don't run I shan't have you for my horse; if you don't run I must get down, for I won't ride lazy horses."</p>
               <p>Uncle Abraham, chuckling and laughing, started on a run, and Amy clapped her hands and shouted in a happy glee. On ran Uncle Abraham, down into<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC5765-00000094"/> the pine grove where lay Elsie Olcot, partly concealed in the thicket. He would never have discovered the lifeless form, he was too much absorbed in the occupation of putting his huge feet down carefully lest he should trip and injure his precious burden.</p>
               <p>"Stop, Uncle Abraham, let me down quick," cried Amy; "there is a woman in the thicket."</p>
               <p>"Where?" said Uncle Abraham, letting her down.</p>
               <p>"This way," replied Amy, and taking him by the hand, she led him into the enclosure.</p>
               <p>Uncle Abraham trembled with fear, being conscious, then, for the first time, of the great wrong he had done Elsie Olcot. He stood spell-bound until Amy awakened him from his lethargy by crying,</p>
               <p>"Fan her, Uncle Abraham; Uncle Abraham, fan her; she is gasping, see her lips quiver; fan her, Uncle Abraham, fan her."</p>
               <p>Elsie was soon restored from her fainting by their exertions. She remembered Abraham, but he gave her no reason to believe that he recognized her. She was too weak to speak; gladly would she have welcomed death.</p>
               <p>Abraham feared to communicate her presence to Edmund; neither would he desert her; he would conceal her for the present in the barn, where he could provide for her. He would pledge Amy to secresy; she would be of great help to him.</p>

               <p>IT was over two months since Mrs. Dawn's death; Dora was still a visitor at Edmund's home. She had kept her promise; she had been a good, kind sister to him. Joseph Bosway had written to her in the most generous terms every week; but she had only replied twice, and then more from compulsion than choice. She had removed his diamond ring the day of her arrival, and had not restored it to her hand. She hesitated and shrank from doing so, because she could not bear to have Edmund see it. She could not bear to have him know that she was claimed by another. A feeling had grown upon her that was more than sympathy, more than sisterly love. She<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC5765-00000095"/> tried to conquer, to control it, <choice>

                     <corr>but was</corr>
                  </choice> not fully aware of its strength. She had been Edmund's companion, morning, noon, and evening; they had ridden, walked, and read together; each succeeding day she felt that his society was more ennobling, more elevating, to her womanly nature. She was never happier than when in his presence; he became dearer to her every hour. But it was too late; she had made a vow to Joseph, and that vow she must keep. For this reason she had resolved to leave Mount Glibe, and every preparation had been made for her departure on the following day. This was to be the last evening of her visit. Edmund had a revelation to made, and after tea she accompanied him to the library. He was reluctant about beginning, talked upon many topics, until the old clock in the tower struck nine. Then, as if aroused to the necessity of speaking, he began:</p>
               <p>"I am about to relate, Miss Elveston, what I have never had the inclination or power to communicate before. I hate to revive it, for it completely unnerves me. When I was a mere boy, there lived in the vicinity of Mount Glibe an elderly lady, whom the neighbors called Aunty Fawn; with her lived a child, younger than myself by three years; whether she was her grandchild or not, I have never been able to discover. One day I went out hunting; after traversing the country for an hour or more, I met this child, who, in her tattered garments and bare feet, excited my pity. She was rather tall of her age, and very slender; her large hazel eyes beamed with so much melancholy, that I could not refrain from speaking kindly to her. She appeared pleased by my notice, and insisted on following me. I was rather amused by this peculiar whim, but consented, and continued my tramp, followed by this strange child. The hunt was unsuccessful; I had shot only a few birds, and they were small. However, an opportunity presented itself, in the shape of a wild pigeon, which flew over my head. I drew up my gun and fired; the bird commenced to fall; in my excited joy, I ran to catch it, heedless of my steps; across my way lay a green, deceptive bog, in which I was soon floundering, and would have perished, but for the timely aid of my companion. From that hour she became my associate, shared in all my sports, and soon became more dexterous with the fishing-rod, and a better shot, than myself. This continued for two years, at the expiration of which time I had finished with my tutor, and entered Yale. When I commenced my college course she gave up wandering in the woods, and took to study; each succeeding year that brought to me academical triumphs, brought to my child companion rare beauty and superior accomplishments. I returned home at the end of the third year to spend my summer vacation, and found my companion, the savior of my life, developed into a fascinating, beautiful woman. Her form had<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC5765-00000096"/> changed its slenderness to rounded symmetry, and her large hazel eyes had added to their melancholy an intellectual expression, through which seemed to dart rays from her brilliant mind. I loved her; God only knows how I loved her; I loved her with all my soul. But I controlled my feelings, and kept my secret. I returned to college, hoping I would forget her. Impossible; I could not. I returned home during the holidays—my last recreation before graduating. I found her the recipient of universal attention. She was the undisputed beauty of the county. Many a young man of promise and wealth stooped, to be refused. I could refrain no longer. I confessed my love, which she professed to reciprocate ardently. My jealousy urged me still further;" he hesitated, looked at Dora, and perceiving that she did not appear astonished or excited, continued: "I insisted; after considerable resistance, she yielded, and we were secretly married. The holidays passed; I returned to college. I wrote to her continually; weeks and months passed, and I had not received a line. I was distracted; I thought I would confess to my mother, but I feared the shock to her. I would rather wait until I could tell her in person. I was ambitious, and could not leave college to go home, even for a day; my standing was among the honored men; a few weeks more, and I would graduate; all would be well. I graduated with the highest honors, returned home to find the green grave of Aunty Fawn, the cottage a charred ruin, and my young, childish, beautiful wife gone. Then came long years of search, full of anguish and despair; those horrid years in which I sank to the depths of drunkenness in which you found me!"</p>
               <p>He arose, and took down a small likeness which had remained with its face turned towards the wall, the very picture that Dora had examined during her previous visit with so much curiosity; handing it to her, he added: "This is Elsie Olcot. Would you think that beautiful face represented so vile a creature? No one would believe that its possessor could have been so false or cruel. Thank God I can view it, and talk about it calmly now; it used to almost drive me mad. I kept it turned to the wall, lest its appearance should call too vividly to my poor shattered mind the original. There," he added, taking the portrait from her, and laying it on the centre table; "that is the last of Elsie Olcot; she is nothing to me. Several months ago I visited the county seat, where my counsellor, Mr. Layer, resides, for the purpose of obtaining a divorce. I received a letter to-day from him, informing me that the papers are ready, and the only thing required to complete the separation was my signature and presence for a few hours."</p>
               <p>During Edmund's revelation, Dora had remained motionless; she had not betrayed the slightest feeling; silence prevailed for some time. He sat with his head resting upon his hands, as if wrapt in<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC5765-00000097"/> thought. Dora prepared to leave the apartment by bidding him good-night. He motioned her to remain, and looking up, began with a voice trembling with emotion:</p>
               <p>"I love you, Dora; I have loved you ever since you watched so tenderly and patiently by my bedside; I have tried to conquer, to reason with this infatuation, but it is useless. Dora, is this feeling reciprocated? and if so, will you forgive and forget the past? will you be my wife?"</p>
               <p>Startled and bewildered, without attempting a reply, she sought to depart; her hand rested upon the knob; in a moment she would be gone. He sprang to his feet and intercepted her. Removing her hand from the knob, he held it, and implored her to speak, if but to say that it was impossible; that he must forget her.</p>
               <p>Her voice was choked, she could not speak; her frame quivered; perceiving her agitation, he clasped her in his arms. She nerved herself, and would have been freed from his embrace, but a storm that had been rumbling during the evening about Mount Glibe, broke in all its fury. From a child, she had feared the flashing lightning and deep rolling thunder. She gave way, and became subservient to his will. He led her to the sofa, and requested her to be seated, then placed himself beside her, and folding his arms around her, drew her close to his heart. She made no resistance; she appreciated his strong embrace, it seemed to shield her from the stern fury of the storm; it consoled her, quieted her fear, and a joy which she could not resist pervaded and thrilled her with ecstasy and delight.</p>

               <p>A WEEK had passed since Abraham and Amy had found Elsie Olcot in the Pine Grove. During the first few days of her sojourn in the barn, she was quite ill, but the good nursing of her secret friends soon restored her to her wonted health.</p>
               <p>"Abraham, do you suppose your master is made of gold? It is shameful that a man of your age shouldn't know better than to give such victuals to a dog. You wasteful hypocrite," cried Aunt Betty, with much excitement, "you have enough in that 'ere basket to give any good Christian three sumptuous meals; I tell you this must be stopped; I will inform Master Edmund."</p>
               <p>Abraham turned his head, and silently walked away; he would have deserted the kitchen, but the exasperated housekeeper intercepted his exit.</p>
               <p>"Oh! auntie, don't scold him, don't blame him, he is doing it all for me, your dear little Amy."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense, child, what could you do with so much food?"</p>
               <p>"I have got a play-house in the barn; Abraham is the father, I am the mother, and Carlo is our only son; we must live like real folks, and have breakfast, dinner, and tea."</p>
               <p>"La, child, it is a perfect waste, it is wicked to encourage you in such extravagance."</p>
               <p>"But you would not spoil your little Amy's fun, would you, Auntie?" She turned up her roguish face, and offered a kiss, which Aunt Betty took, and drove them playfully out of the kitchen; she then returned to her pastry, muttering something about ruined children and wicked indulgences.</p>
               <p>Abraham bore his heavily laden basket triumphantly to the barn, while Amy clapped her hands exultingly, and danced around him for joy. Elsie Olcot was in a variable mood. At times she would cuddle Amy up in her arms, and in her wild joy cry over, then kiss her rapturously, pat her cheeks, and fondle her flaxen hair. At other times she would push Amy away in her despair, then, in a moment after, repent of her cruelty, gather her up in her arms, hold her close to her aching heart, and call her endearing pet names. She waited with more than usual impatience for Amy's coming;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC5765-00000099"/> when she entered with Abraham and the laden basket, her mother's heart yearned to tell her all. When Abraham withdrew, in her ecstasy she forgot herself, and kneeling down, looked into the child's hazel eyes, and called her by her name "Amy Ray." The hazel eyes opened wide with wonder:</p>
               <p>"How did you know my name? but that an't my name now, it is Amy Dawn."</p>
               <p>"Because I knew your mother," replied Elsie, trembling with great emotion.</p>
               <p>"I never had any mother."</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, you had a bad, wicked mother, that left you;" she could say no more—her sobs choked her.</p>
               <p>"No, I hadn't any mother, either, but I had a Grandma Ray, and Grandma Dawn; they went away, and turned into two big bright stars. They come every night and watch their little Amy when she is asleep. Phebe says that Pa is going to get me a Ma; that he is going to turn Aunt Dora into one; ain't that funny."</p>
               <p>"No, no; he can't do that, you have only one mother; she loves you better than all the world, more than life."</p>
               <p>"Where is she, why don't she come to her little Amy?"</p>
               <p>"She is near you now." She puts her arms around you, she would have added, but she dared not reveal herself then, in her miserable poverty and wretchedness. From this hour she was miserable in the extreme treme. Another woman had supplanted her in her husband's affections; she would become his wife, and teach her child, her all, to call her mother. That night she watched from the barn the light, which cast its rays from the Gothic window of the library. The demoniac desire for self-destruction filled her soul; she had the weapon—a table-knife—which she had secreted and sharpened; what a bloody deed—but then she would go from this vale of tears and sorrow. A crazed glare was in her eyes; she looked at the burnished blade, and placed it to her heart. At this moment the vivid flash and deafening crash of a storm broke forth in fury. She sprang to her feet in wild excitement; she could not die unrepentant, steeped in guilt; her feelings of frenzy were suspended by fear, and with quaking heart she fled from the barn, out into the storm; in her despair she went close to the Gothic window; the light was comforting, she was tempted; she looked in. Fear left her; the raging storm, the vivid flash, the deafening crash, had lost their terror; she cared not for the falling torrents that drenched her to the skin. She was engrossed by Edmund and Dora's actions. Hate, love, and revenge mingled in her bosom—the past with its overpowering affections had a momentary triumph. She loved him, loved him more fondly than ever. An hour passed, the storm subsided; Dora had gone, Edmund paced the floor, his heart fluttering with joy. His life had opened a new scroll, on which<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC5765-00000100"/> were engraven years of bright hopes, of dreamy pleasure, and inspiring, noble love. He sat down to weave mythical illusions, an Elysium of existence—Elsie opened the casement softly, and stole into the room. With a cat-like tread she approached him, and laid her hand on his shoulder.</p>

               <p>EDMUND, startled, turned his head, and met her gaze. He struggled to recover himself. Could it be possible? Yes, it was she confronting him. He shuddered, and whispered almost inaudibly,</p>
               <p>"My God! Elsie Olcot!"</p>
               <p>"No," she retorted, with a scornful voice; "not Elsie Olcot, the outcast, but Elsie Dawn, the forsaken, the degraded wife of Edmund Dawn. See what you have made me! Dare you think of what I was? Behold this wasted form, these tattered garments, and read in the villany of your black heart the fallen condition of your lawful wife. I am here to avenge." She drew from beneath the folds of her dress the glittering knife, and raised it in a position to strike.</p>
               <p>Edmund folded his arms and looked quietly into<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC5765-00000101"/> her pale and desperate face. He gazed into her eyes; they possessed a horrible foreboding.</p>
               <p>"You once saved my life; you may take it. I will make no resistance. Come, avenge yourself on the man who has so fearfully wronged you! Strike, for he can welcome death!"</p>
               <p>The influence of his soft gray eyes held her spell-bound. She fell upon her knees, and seizing his hand kissed it passionately, and bedewed it with her tears.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Edmund! pity and forgive your fallen wife! Oh, have mercy upon poor Elsie, the mother of your child!"</p>
               <p>"My child!" he gasped.</p>
               <p>"Yes, your forsaken child." She saw the cold, forbidding look that had settled on his face, and desisting from her pleadings, she gave way to wilder grief. He arose, with an air of authority demanded the knife, then instructed her not to leave the apartment without his consent. She tremblingly promised compliance. He left the room, passed into the hall, and procuring his hat, went out into the night. Every vestige of the storm had disappeared; the mellow moon floated in a clear blue sky. He went down the broad avenue, and turning into the deserted road, continued his walk, in an agony of meditation. After the lapse of half an hour or more, he paused in the shadow of the Old Stone Church; his hand rested upon the wicket gate; he entered, and going to the right, knelt by the side of his mother's grave. He groaned with anguish. Great drops of sweat stood on his brow. Must he give up Dora? Must his only ray of light and hope be shut out, to leave him evermore in darkness? He tried to pray, but could not; the tempestuous heavings of his soul prostrated him; he lay by the side of his mother's grave and wished that he was dead. Almost in a swoon he lay there. By and by a change came over him. He seemed to hear his mother's voice; its sweet accent whispered, "Ever forgive." He arose to his feet a stronger and a better man. "Ever forgive" was the still, small whisper. "Ever forgive" pervaded the whole of Nature, and myriads of voices chimed it in his ears.</p>
               <p>On entering her apartment, Dora seated herself by the window, and gave way to a flood of tears. Oh, how his burning words of love sunk into her very heart. With what weakness did she try to prevent his discovering that his passion, his ardent affection, was reciprocated. With what ecstasy did his touch fill her. With what power had it awakened her to the magnitude of her love. She had made a promise; she must fulfil it, and neglect the man whom she loved more than her life. No, she could not, would not. She would be more selfish than to sacrifice her happiness, and make the world a blank. On the morrow, when she returned, she would tell Joseph all, and ask him to release her, to forgive her, to think of her as a sister only. She would<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC5765-00000102"/> pray for him, pray that he might love some one more worthy of him; truer and more devoted than she could be. She calmed herself, and felt quite happy for a while. She saw Edmund go down the broad avenue to the road; wondered where he went, and watched for his return. She remained by the window for hours. When he came back, she bathed her swollen eyes and throbbing temples; then sought her couch, but found no rest. In her anguish of heart, she tossed to and fro, and breathed through her bloodless lips, "Too late! too late!" Morning came, and found her an early riser. She went out before the sun had wiped away the dew; went to the summer house, which stood in the centre of the flower garden in the rear of the mansion. She seated herself beneath the drooping branches of the sweet-brier, which grew in profusion over the arbor. The morning air, with its fresh fragrance, gave her strength. She would remain here for a short time and consider; then seek Edmund, and conceal nothing. She had hardly settled herself for reflection when she perceived him coming toward her. He stopped and plucked a rose from her favorite bush, beneath which was buried the basket with its contents of broken glass. The scene returned; his words of that afternoon pounded in her ears. "In the future, let the coming sisters of this beautiful flower be symbols that Dora Elveston is pleased with the battle of life waged by Edmund Dawn." He seated himself beside her, and handed her the rose; then took her hand within his own, which was cold as death. She looked into his face, and was startled by the change. It wore a pale and anguished look. She covered her face with her hands and wept bitterly. Presently she raised her head, and said:</p>
               <p>"I have a confession to make. I should have informed you before, but could not find the courage. I would have prevented you last evening from expressing your passion, but was powerless. I love you more than I had ever hoped or wished or dared to love another. Before I was aware of my heart's promptings, I promised another. Pity and sympathy were the advocates that influenced me to become Joseph Bosway's affianced. From this hour, I am dead to all purposes, lost to all hopes and joys."</p>
               <p>"My angel Dora, you shall not sacrifice yourself; a dark, foreboding cloud hangs over me also, but brave hearts will dispel these threatenings. Elsie Olcot, my deluded and wandering wife, has returned. She is this moment beneath my roof."</p>
               <p>Dora uttered a cry of pain, and started to her feet. He caught her almost fainting in his arms.</p>
               <p>"Oh! my darling, have courage; I will drive this base outcast, this woman who has been the bane of my life, from my home. You must break this rash engagement, cost what it may. We will live to make each other happy."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Edmund, don't add to my misery, don't<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC5765-00000103"/> tempt me from the path of duty." Her demeanor changed, she became resolute and released herself from his embrace; her eye met his with a calm fortitude, and she added: "Edmund Dawn, you must do your duty. You must 'ever forgive.'"</p>
               <p>She had gone. He had made no effort to detain her. He watched her enter the house. An hour later the carriage was at the door; her trunks were strapped on, Dora took her seat, and was soon on her journey home. The rumbling sound of the wheels dying out in the distance, awakened him to the reality of his loss. The last ray of his life had gone out. Each moment drew closer around his soul the folds of total darkness; hour after hour passed, and still he sat unconscious and powerless. The evening twilight came, and with it the sacred whispering of his mother's voice—"Ever forgive." By its benign influence he grew strong; with a firm step he approached the house, and entered the library. Taking Elsie by the hand, he led her into the spacious hall, up the broad staircase to the apartment which was formerly occupied by his mother. An air of holiness seemed to pervade it, which made it the dearest spot on earth to him. He felt that if spirits ever communed with man, his mother would be there. He took Elsie's hands and looked down into her haggard face:</p>
               <p>"From this hour you are mistress of my home. I forgive, and will try to forget the past." He returned to the library, and traversed the floor, conscious scious that he had done his duty. His feelings of triumph were only momentary, however. He was soon overcome by the great sacrifice he had made; he roamed about the apartment almost devoid of reason. Midnight found him prostrated and dejected. He had nothing to live for, nothing to look forward to, nothing but misery and despair. He would go back to the maddening cup; on the morrow he would visit the Friendship. He would join his old associates in debauchery, and benumb his sensibilities. He would dream life away in apathy, even to the end. A voice broke the stillness of the night. It was Phebe's, in prayer. Its soft earnestness pleased him. He listened. His heart melted, his soul poured forth homage and devotion. All was quiet again. Edmund Dawn was changed. He had found a work. His life should be devoted to liberty; to the emancipation of an oppressed race. Ever after, his iron will and lion heart were bent to this new purpose of his existence.</p>

               <p>TWO years had elapsed since Dora parted from Edmund in the arbor. It had been a terrible battle for her, yet she had conquered, and could now look back with complacency to the hours in which she had suffered so much. No one had discovered her secret, not even Joseph Bosway. Her brilliant color deserted her for awhile, but her friends attributed it to some other cause, and never imagined that her proud and noble heart had passed through the severe ordeal of a disappointed love. The Stranford family, including the insipid Van Vickle, had gone to Washington, for the purpose of witnessing the closing scenes of Congress. The capital was unusually gay; the thoughtless, the frivolous, and the selfish, had gathered from all parts of the country, like chattering swallows about a smoky chimney. The wives and daughters of this conglomeration were crowding the thoroughfares, thronging the receptions and ball-rooms by their mystical deceptions. At last the great day of the season had come; in its bright and balmy air, thousands flocked to the capitol. The hall of Representatives was packed; many went away unable to gain admittance. The Stranfords, Dora, and Van Vickle, with Major Bigby, had procured front seats in the gallery. The question to be discussed had disturbed for years the prosperity and peace of the nation. It was the absorbing question whether slavery should be carried into the Territories. The ablest men on both sides had debated, with the exception of New York's young and gifted son. The House was called to order; amid profound silence the gentleman from the Empire State had risen. The past two years had been a season of success and triumph to Hon. Joseph Bosway. This was his second term; his abilities were considered second to none of the representative men of the country. He was the acknowledged leader of the slavery party in the house; he argued the necessity of slavery, showed how it had existed through ages past; alluded to the Bible to prove that it was sanctioned by God; deduced scientific arguments to illustrate the inferiority of the African race; contended that they were incapable of providing for themselves; that their care and protection exemplified Christian love, and concluded by urging with burning eloquence the<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC5765-00000105"/> unconstitutionality of excluding them from any territory, declaring that slave-owners had rights that every loyal citizen was in duty bound to respect. His polished delivery, his logical deductions, his rhetorical periods, held the audience spell-bound. Amid prolonged applause he took his seat. The Speaker, restoring order, said if the House was ready for the question, he would put the vote. After a moment's silence, a member arose from one of the remote seats in a far-off corner; being recognized by the Speaker, he was allowed the floor.</p>
               <p>"Who is that who attempts to respond to such a brilliant, unanswerable effort?" was the whisper that went through the gallery.</p>
               <p>"That is the new member from Pennsylvania," was the reply.</p>
               <p>At first the speaker was scarcely heard, he spoke so low, and his voice trembled with emotion; uncomplimentary remarks were paid him in the gallery. "Audacious fool!" said one. "What a piece of presumption," said another. "More fit to herd swine than represent the sovereign people," added an elderly gentleman of portly appearance.</p>
               <p>"I guess you are right," chimed a Down-easter, "hoeing corn is undoubtedly his profession."</p>
               <p>The Southern chivalry smiled exultingly. Many northern countenances expressed utter disgust for their champion. Dora was perplexed and alarmed; the trembling voice was familiar to her ear; could it be possible—yes, it was he whom she had not seen or heard from since the morning she parted with him in the arbor at Mount Glibe. He here; confronting the man whom she had promised to marry; the man she had put off from time to time with petty excuses, because she could not give him her whole heart.</p>
               <p>It was Edmund's maiden speech, but he was unprepared; emotional impulse had brought him to his feet. He realized the giant he was about to attack, and the rashness of his undertaking. He was tremulous lest he should fail; a feeling of his own weakness almost overcame him. His fears were only momentary. A consciousness that he was battling for the right fired his lion heart. His voice changed from a weak tremulousness to a sonorous fulness, and its rich tones rang through the Representative chamber, and brought conviction into the hearts of his hearers. There was a higher law than man's credulity; there was a nobler, purer justice than man's discernment. It was the law and justice that regulated the arm of Omnipotence. It was the fruition of God's grandeur—the light of salvation which a merciful Father had given to all ages. "The learned and honorable gentleman from New York would have you circumvent that law; he would seek to persuade you, by his seductive eloquence and honeyed accent, that misery was preferable to happiness; that slavery, with the shackle and lash, was a state of Elysium in which the African could bask, protected from the neglect<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC5765-00000106"/> and cruelties of liberty. He would delude and flatter you with the unction, that because your souls wore white habiliments, they were more acceptable in the eye of the Creator; more worthy of Christ's blood, that was shed for all. He holds up to your gaze, bondage, dripping with gore, resounding with the cries and groans of three millions of sufferers, and bids you behold Christianity and love exemplified. Salvation, by his forensic pleading, is no longer free; it is circumscribed and perverted by lordly masters. Thousands of souls are hampered and driven from the ways of chastity, from the love of Christ, by the braided lash. Yet the honorable gentleman with his mask of hypocrisy, clad in his armor of false fallacies, stands here in the very capital of a nation that boasts of its freedom and equality, and proclaims to the American people that every loyal citizen must bow in obeisance before the monarch of bondage; that every upholder of the Constitution must cheerfully submit to the Divine institution, that pampered the indolence of the lordly aristocracy of the sunny South. Sir, this is the course that he, as a beneficent legislator, would have us pursue; this the light in which he would present freedom, as interpreted by a nation of freemen to a civilized world. He would have us bind the fetters tighter. He would have us knot the lash, and bury it deeper in the flesh of suffering humanity. He would direct us to make every city, town, and hamlet throughout the vast dimensions of our happy land, a mart for the traffic in human flesh. And then with a bland smile, he assures us that such is exemplified Christian love. God forbid that we should ever live to enjoy such Christian love, and may He in His infinite wisdom deliver America, the land of our birth, from the all-powerful demon of slavery!"</p>
               <p>When Edmund had concluded and taken his seat, the silence of conviction, caused by his earnest eloquence, pervaded the chamber. The exulting smiles of Southern chivalry had faded into an expression of revengeful hate, and the utter disgust of the Northern constituents had brightened into a triumphal glow of patriotism. The vote was then taken, which resulted in a great victory for the Radicals; Edmund's speech had wrought a powerful effect. Slavery ever after regarded him as its most formidable adversary.</p>

               <p>THE evening of the last day of the session, President Buchanan gave a levee. The concourse of people that flocked to pay the Old Bachelor homage was unusually large. Hon. Joseph Bosway entered with Dora on his arm; Sadie was escorted by Major Bigby. After paying their respects, he conducted her from the motley throng into one of the corridors of the hall; his face wore an expression of sadness, he drew from his note-book an official communication, and asked her to peruse it; she did so, returning it with a slight expression of sorrow. Hesitatingly, he said, "his life, in the Western wilds, would not be so lonely if he could carry with him the best wishes of his friends."</p>
               <p>"If such are of any avail, I assure you you have mine," replied Sadie.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Miss Stranford, but I hope for more than that."</p>
               <p>"Probably your hopes can be realized," she added, with a bewitching cunning in her eye.</p>
               <p>"Then this order of banishment from civilization which I have received from the War Department would have at least one bright side."</p>
               <p>"You see it is not all darkness, after all," she remarked, smilingly.</p>
               <p>"No, not if you are willing to send the light with me."</p>
               <p>"Why, Major," she retorted, assuming a perplexed air, "what light can I give you?"</p>
               <p>"A promise."</p>
               <p>"I don't mind giving you that as a parting gift."</p>
               <p>"I fear you would if you realized its purport."</p>
               <p>"Try me and see."</p>
               <p>"I will take you at your word." He bent slightly towards her and whispered in a tremulous voice. She drew her arm from his, and flashed at him an indignant, haughty look.</p>
               <p>"You absurd, ridiculous man; to think that I should bind myself for two years," and she laughed coldly in his face.</p>
               <p>"Never mind, you may be sorry some day;" and without making another appeal he led her back to the parlor.</p>
               <p>Edmund Dawn came alone and late. He attracted more attention than any other notable. Around him the gathering was the greatest. Dora was attracted with the others, and looking, met his cold, placid eye. It did not excite any unusual emotion<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC5765-00000108"/> tion, and that evening, when she retired, she wondered how she had ever been so infatuated. The next morning Sadie related to Mrs. Stranford, in the presence of Dora and her father, her interview with the Major; her mother commended her sagacity, and told her she was far too precious to compromise herself by making a promise to poor gallantry. Dora censured her conduct, and thought the part she had played, cruel and shameful.</p>
               <p>"If you did not love him you should not have led him to acknowledge his passion."</p>
               <p>Sadie laughingly replied, "You dear, good girl, if you desire a greater number of beaux you must be more worldly. I would not possess your sympathy for anything; it would destroy my pleasure and my happiness."</p>
               <p>"Your fantastical delusions, Sadie, will come to grief, some day," said Dora, rather warmly.</p>
               <p>"Not so long as men pay homage to rare beauty," chimed in Mrs. Stranford.</p>
               <p>"That is no excuse, aunt; she should not use her prepossessing appearance to fascinate and then inflict pain."</p>
               <p>"Dora, you are severe, you are unreasonable; how can the girl protect herself from the weakness of men? If they will be fools, like the Major, and love beyond their purse-strings, they must expect rejection."</p>
               <p>"It is the same old story," cried Dora, "barter and trade."</p>
               <p>"Exactly," responded the ambitious mother; "no one will give diamonds for stubble, or beauty for withering buds of affection."</p>
               <p>"Then you base your choice of a life partner on the extent of his possessions."</p>
               <p>"Exactly; interest, hard-working, never-ceasing interest, can give more comfort and happiness than a world full of Cupid's darts."</p>
               <p>"But interest is the offspring of wealth, and sometimes takes flight, deserts the home of luxury and flies across the ocean of losses."</p>
               <p>"Quite right; but a girl should be sagacious, and select a man who has this artful power imprisoned in good securities."</p>
               <p>"What do you call good securities?"</p>
               <p>"Why, bank shares, railroad certificates, and the most substantial of all, real estate, or <foreign xml:lang="LAT">terra firma</foreign>."</p>
               <p>"Oh, aunt! these are mere baubles; they all have perishable values: I should rather select my partner with a more lasting, elevating view: one possessing noble inspirations, and having high ends to accomplish."</p>
               <p>"You have the worst of it, my love; Dora has the knotted end of the rope," broke in DeWitt Stranford. He secretly agreed with his wife, but professed to differ, for he desired to turn this golden opportunity to Joseph's advantage. "There is nothing like honor; give me honor, distinction that shall live in the grateful hearts of my country for ever."</p>
               <pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC5765-00000109"/>
               <p>"There is your oddity, again, Dewitt; you are a child in many respects."</p>
               <p>"My love, you misconstrue."</p>
               <p>"No, I don't; distinction won't support a luxurious home, with its equipages and servants, nor will honor pay for a box at the Opera, nor produce the wherewith to obtain laces and satins. Give me an income, and you can have your titles, and flatter yourself with your poor distinctions."</p>
               <p>"If all the world agreed with you, my love, there would be no law-makers, no path-finders in the road of progress for coming generations."</p>
               <p>"You and Dora may cherish your absurdity, but give me a man, sagacious enough to accumulate revenue, one who is able to give his family every enjoyable indulgence."</p>
               <p>"Why, my little episode of last evening has made quite a discussion," cried Sadie. "I am afraid so many doctors will kill the patient; but I will try and profit by what I have heard from you, expounders of wisdom. I feel inclined to lean to the substantial. If I ever choose, I will more than <choice>
                     <sic>ikely</sic>

               <p>WASHINGTON was deserted by its pleasure-seekers. The members of the Senate and House had gone to their homes. Edmund returned to his with a happy consciousness that he had done his duty in battling for the cause of humanity. The inhabitants of Mount Glibe welcomed him with enthusiastic joy. The old antique buildings were decorated with flags, the air was deafened by the roar of artillery, and at night flaming bonfires threw out their glaring blaze from the surrounding hill-tops. Amy met him at the depot, and in her childish glee gave him an excruciating hug. The carriage rolled up the winding drive; Elsie, in one of the dormitories of the old tower, secreted behind a blind, watched him alight. After<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC5765-00000110"/> tea Amy had her romping, toss-and-tumble frolic on the floor; she crept into his lap, and rested her chubby, roguish head against his beating heart.</p>
               <p>"You big, naughty pa, to go and leave your little Amy so long alone. If it hadn't been for dear, good Elsie, she would have cried all the time. Elsie tells me beautiful stories, and is a better teacher than you are. When I have a hard lesson, she helps me, and that is more than you, big, naughty teacher, did. I wish you knew her; I know you would love her as much as I do. Why is it that she always avoids you, pa, and never comes into your presence? If it wasn't for me, she would cry all the time. I have to pull her hands down and wipe her tears away; then she smiles. Her cheeks are awful pale; I pinch them sometimes to make them rosy and red. Do you know she says I have a mother, a real mother, that loves me, and some day I will know who she is? Is it true, pa? and if it is, why don't mother come home to make you and all of us happy? I have made you sad, haven't I, pa?" and she put her arms around his neck and kissed him. "Do you know Carlo is turning from a dog into a Christian? So Aunt Betty says. He won't eat meat unless it is cooked; ain't that funny? and my pussy cat has got three kittens—one with a white-spot face and two as black as Phebe. Why, you won't talk, will you? You want to be alone, so I will give you a big kiss for good-night, and go to Elsie; she will cry if I stay away too long."</p>
               <p>He walked the floor. Amy's little plaintive appeal for Elsie had sunk into his heart and filled him with the enormity of his own meanness. Here was a poor fallen creature, whom he had forgiven, yet he shrank from acknowledging it to the world. This was the narrowness of the good action which he had sought to do. He had given his young, deluded wife a home, but was not that home a prison—even worse, a hell—in which she was ever reminded of the greatness of her transgressions and of all that she had lost? Why shouldn't she be pale and weep? Hadn't the years she had passed beneath his roof been those of remorse and agony? And yet he had flattered himself that he had forgiven her, that he had grown stronger, nobler. But Amy's voice had awakened him to the extent of his weakness and his selfishness.</p>
               <p>Late one evening, about a week afterward, while examining the contents of his escritoire, he read the instructions which accompanied Mrs. Ray's narrative. He scrutinized the roll of parchment in which was sealed her secret, and laid it away, wondering whether he should ever discover the interested parties. Abraham knocked, and was admitted. The old man stood by the fireplace and looked bewildered into the fire, and in reply to his master's inquiring look, intimated with fear that he had a confession to make. Edmund told him to be seated. After considerable hesitation, in which his eyes wandered about the room in a vacant stare, he ejaculated:</p>
               <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC5765-00000111"/>
               <p>"Oh, master, have mercy upon your poor old servant; he's so wicked; he wrong you, master; he have caused a great misery; he did it for the love he have for the misstus, God bless her! for the love he have for your mother. Oh! my noble master, what will you do to poor Abraham when you know all?" He covered his face with his hands and moaned piteously.</p>
               <p>"Come, Abraham, my good old man, you are fretting yourself with some foolish misapprehension which will prove a mole-hill."</p>
               <p>"No, it's not, master; I have been so awful wicked; but I will tell you all, master. I kept the letters, the ones which Miss Elsie gave me to post for you, and the ones that came to you from her." He drew out from under his coat a package and handed it to Edmund. "Oh, my master, my poor master, your Abraham has ruined you, has ruined your happiness; he never would have done it if he did not think that he was separating those whom your mother—your mother—dear angel, feared would be joined." He sank down upon his knees, and clasping Edmund's hands, with the most bitter cries of anguish implored forgiveness.</p>
               <p>Edmund sat like one in a trance. He did not hear or heed the old man's cry. Her sufferings and his sufferings absorbed every faculty. In his overwhelming anguish he was almost forced to open his mouth and curse his old servant. By and by the intercessions of Abraham were felt. His heart softened; he pitied and forgave. Then Abraham blessed him and went off with a lighter heart than he had possessed for years.</p>
               <p>Edmund examined the package and found all of his letters to Elsie, and also all of hers—which far outnumbered his. None of the seals were broken; they were in the same condition as when Abraham received them.</p>
               <p>Elsie had hushed Amy to sleep, and tucked her away in her crib, when a tap on the door summoned her. She opened it, and Edmund, entering, strewed upon the bureau the intercepted letters. His unexpected appearance startled her. He here, in her apartment! he, under whose roof she had found a shelter, but not one word or look of recognition. What could it mean? She felt weak and faint, she extended her hand to a chair for support.</p>
               <p>"Oh! Elsie," cried Edmund, "I have wronged you, I have cruelly misjudged you; forgive me, for I was ignorant. Look; here are our letters in the condition they left us. Abraham intercepted them. Will you forgive me, and be as we were in happy days and brighter years?"</p>
               <p>She could not speak—her heart was too full. In his eagerness he seized her in his arms, and kissing her, called her his own dear Elsie, his wife. Tears trickled down her pale cheeks. She muttered that she had forgiven him years ago, ever since the night she had sought his forgiveness in the library. They stood in each other's embrace for a while, and<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC5765-00000112"/> the noble prompting of their hearts as husband and wife came and buried for ever the horrible past.</p>
               <p>Elsie's face had lost its paleness; a bright color had transfused it, and her eye shone with a radiant joy. She had a revelation to make. She took Edmund to the side of Amy's crib.</p>
               <p>"Bright, beautiful, innocent; isn't she handsome? Oh! Edmund, little Amy is not an outcast or a wanderer. God, in his goodness, has made you the rescuer and protector of your own child."</p>
               <p>He could not comprehend her for a moment; he was bewildered; but he looked into her calm, truthful eyes, and realized the truth—Amy was no longer his adopted but his own darling child. His heart yearned with parental affection; in ecstatic joy he seized the child in his arms, and rapturously kissing her, aroused her from her sleep.</p>
               <p>"Oh! pa," said Amy, opening her large hazel eyes, "I dreamed mother came home."</p>
               <p>"So she has, my darling pet; Elsie, dear Elsie, is your mother."</p>
               <p>"My real mother?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, your real, beautiful, loving mother."</p>
               <p>"Oh! pa, Amy is so glad, Amy is so happy."</p>
               <p>She put out her arms, and clasping her mother about her neck, clung to her tenaciously,—father's and mother's tears of joy mingled on her flaxen hair.</p>

               <p>IT was a bright morning. Mr. Stranford went across the way to a building opposite his office; he climbed up three pair of stairs, opened the door of a dingy apartment, and inquired for a young lawyer named Mayton.</p>
               <p>"The gentleman was out, but would shortly return," was a small boy's reply.</p>
               <p>Mr. Stranford seated-himself, and soon the individual of whom he was in search entered.</p>
               <p>"Mayton, sit down and write what I dictate."</p>
               <p>The young counsellor did as directed.</p>
               <p>"When you receive the answer, send it to my office with the bill for your services."</p>
               <p>A few days after, the answer came from Mayton; Mr. Stranford broke the seal and read: "The child was found at No. — Wooster Street.</p>
               <p>"EDMUND DAWN."</p>
               <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC5765-00000113"/>
               <p>"Good," he muttered, "the very clue I require;" and he struck the silver bell upon his desk, and instructed the messenger to inform Terence that he desired his presence immediately. He was explicit and brief in his directions to Terence. He was to go to the number indicated in Dawn's communication, learn all he could in regard to the child and her associates, spare no time or expense, and he should be well rewarded.</p>
               <p>That evening Mr. Stranford buttoned up his greatcoat, and went home sad and dejected. Things were going entirely different from the way in which he had calculated.</p>
               <p>The long delay of Joseph's and Dora's marriage was bringing him fast to the brink of ruin. Something must be done; he would seek the elder Van Vickle, and through his advice, enter into any speculation that had the appearance of profit. After tea he visited his friend, and was heartily received by the wealthy banker. It was a long while before he spoke of the purpose of his call; when he did, it was done so adroitly, that the shrewd financier never imagined that was the sole motive of his coming.</p>
               <p>"I must confess, Van Vickle, if I saw a good chance, I would step out of my profession for a few weeks, and try my luck in Wall Street."</p>
               <p>"You would make but a poor go of it, if you were not advised by an old stager."</p>
               <p>"I should expect you to take that supervision over me," responded Stranford.</p>
               <p>"Are you serious?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Then I will let you into a secret. Our house is forming a combination to corner a certain stock; if you really mean business we will let you into the pool."</p>
               <p>"I most assuredly do."</p>
               <p>"Then all you have to do, is to deposit with us fifty thousand dollars and take a twentieth interest; I will guarantee you against loss, and you will more than likely make over one hundred per cent."</p>
               <p>"I am your man, but I must confess that your liberality is beyond anything I ever heard of."</p>
               <p>"That may be, but it is in the family," retorted Van Vickle, with a knowing wink; "Henry and your black-eyed Sadie will get it all in the end."</p>
               <p>Terence had great difficulty in following up Mr. Stranford's clue. The only person who knew anything about the child was the old apple-woman, Mrs. Malloy. He went to see her many times, but each time she became more reticent, and declared she would tell nothing, except to the proper person. Stranford directed him to bring her to the office; accordingly, one afternoon when business was over, he ushered her into his master's presence, and retired.</p>
               <p>"Be seated, my good woman. Can you inform me," he inquired, "in regard to this child Amy?"</p>
               <pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC5765-00000114"/>
               <p>"Ay, I could, but what does the likes of yees want to know for?"</p>
               <p>"Because I wish to further her interest; don't be obstinate; you shall be well rewarded."</p>
               <p>"How much will you give me?"</p>
               <p>"Whatever is just; will twenty dollars be sufficient?"</p>
               <p>"No, nor thirty."</p>
               <p>"Then say sixty."</p>
               <p>"Ah! sure yees are deceiving me."</p>
               <p>"No, I'm not," and he counted sixty dollars and held the roll of bills in his hand, saying: "This is yours if you will answer my questions."</p>
               <p>"It's a go," replied Mrs. Malloy.</p>
               <p>"Did the old woman who died, ever write anything that you know of?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>"How do you know?"</p>
               <p>"Because I used to go into her room when she and the child was away."</p>
               <p>"That was how you discovered that she had written a narrative of her life for the edification of some unknown persons."</p>
               <p>"Exactly so, sir."</p>
               <p>"Did she have a mole on her left cheek?" continued Mr. Stranford, hesitatingly.</p>
               <p>"For sure she did, sir."</p>
               <p>"Could you swear to it?"</p>
               <p>"Indade and I could, sir—and her name was Ray," responded Mrs. Malloy.</p>
               <p>"That will do," and he handed her the money. She curtsied herself out in a jaunty manner, giving expression to various exclamations, such as, "Long life to ye, and the blessing of an old critter go with ye forever." Mr. Stranford arose and paced his private office in a nervous, fitful mood. His cunning, crafty face had a troubled look; it was some time before he calmed himself, and summoned Terence, to whom he said rather sharply:</p>
               <p>"I have always been your friend, have I not?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>"Did I not raise you from a common butler to a position of respectability and comparative ease; one which compensates you generously? I expect you at my house by eight; I will then test your gratitude. If you prove worthy, your remuneration shall be large; you can go; remember, to-night at eight."</p>
               <p>"Time for action," muttered Mr. Stranford, when he was alone. "Joseph must know all, and be implicated." Stepping to the door which led to the main office, he called Joseph, who came immediately. Stranford locked the door; drawing close together two chairs, he motioned Joseph to one, while he took the other. After a short silence, Mr. Stranford said, in great agitation,</p>
               <p>"I am ruined; I am the most wretched of beings; to you, and to you only, can I appeal for assistance. I throw myself upon your tender mercies; to you I will confess. I am a defaulter,<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC5765-00000115"/> a robber; calm yourself, and listen. I have appropriated for my own use the larger portion of my ward's, my niece's fortune."</p>
               <p>"How could you, sir?" ejaculated Joseph; "how could you defraud an orphan, your sister's child?"</p>
               <p>"Be patient, Joseph; it was the extravagance of my family which drove me to it; and you, dear Joseph, my love for you led me into foolish fancies. Your election to Congress has cost me thousands; every nomination which you have received has been solely through the influence of my money."</p>
               <p>"Indeed, sir," replied Joseph, "I was not aware that you were my benefactor to such an extent."</p>
               <p>"You never would have known it if I could have worked out of this trouble alone; do not desert me, dear Joseph; be as a son to me; aid me with your counsel in this hour of trial." Mr. Stranford's distracted grief had a tendency to soften Joseph. Stranford fully understood that his protégé's weakness was sympathy; and by Joseph's expression, was aware that he had succeeded in exciting it.</p>
               <p>"An opportunity presents itself, by which I can rid myself of this embarrassment. Last evening I called on the elder Van Vickle, and he informed me that his house was forming a pool to corner a stock, and if I had fifty thousand to deposit with him, my profit would be one or two hundred per cent. I should incur no loss, he would give me a written guarantee. I thanked him for his kind, generous friendship, and stated that I would probably bly avail myself of his liberality. I should have accepted then, but was resolved to tell you all, <choice>
                     <sic>aud</sic>
                     <corr>and</corr>
                  </choice> be directed by your discretion. Think of it, Joseph; to-morrow we will confer again. Oh, have mercy, have mercy upon your fallen friend!"</p>
               <p>Joseph left Mr. Stranford's presence with a sad heart. At first he thought he would go immediately and inform Dora; but he could not betray the confidence of his benefactor. Mr. Stranford felt greatly relieved after the interview. He was certain, come what might, that Joseph Bosway would be implicated with him from this hour. If disaster came, Dora would forgive Joseph, and that would save him also.</p>

               <p>TWO horsemen rode up a wild and rugged road; the night was dark and cold, but they were well protected against the severity of the weather; their horses trotted at a brisk rate; neither appearing anxious to talk, they rode in silence. They had travelled many miles, and finally dismounted in front of the Friendship. The larger of the two rapped at the door, which was opened by Abel Stickney.</p>
               <p>"Halloo, my braves!" he exclaimed, while he fastened and barred the door; "you are earlier than I looked for, by two hours."</p>
               <p>"Nothing like taking time by the forelock," retorted the tall man. "Let us drink something that will warm us. Riding on such a cold night is anything but pleasant. Draw the table near the fire, and let us have a warming-up both in and outside."</p>
               <p>Abel obeyed, and the three were soon seated around the table. The tall man proved to be Terence, and his companion Jim Attobee.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Stickney, I see you have performed a portion of your work; you have the brute well chained to the leg of the stove."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir; that is the famous Carlo. No one could get near the Dawn estate if he was at home; he'd soon arouse the household, niggers and all. I tell you I had a hard time to capture him; it was only this morning I succeeded. He's a knowing dog, you bet, but I entrapped him. You see, I knew it would be folly for you to attempt anything if the dog was not secured; so, after trying various modes, all of them failing, I took my gun and went over to Dawn's; going to the stable, I entered into conversation with old Abraham. By and by Carlo made his appearance, and when he saw the fowling-piece, he was in for a tramp. I told the darkey I was off for a hunt across the fields and down by the old mill, and if he didn't mind, I'd take the dog for a little run. Shortly after I left, got over the fence, and went into the great forest back of Dawn's mansion. Carlo followed, and became my prisoner."</p>
               <p>"Bravo!" said Terence; and he laughed heartily at Stickney's shrewdness. They filled their glasses, and drank with more than usual relish.</p>
               <p>"Now to business, boys," said Terence. "A wealthy gentleman, a friend of mine, requested me to take this little job in hand; he assured me that no harm should come to myself or associates; he<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC5765-00000117"/> can protect and shield us if the adventure should prove unsuccessful. But there is no danger of that; we are too shrewd to be caught in any way that the law can touch us. What he desires to procure is a paper, a confession of an old woman, which he has every reason to believe is in the possession of Edmund Dawn. We are instructed to enter the Dawn mansion by one of the library windows, force open the escritoire, procure the document, give the house an appearance of having been searched for valuables, and then withdraw. A little, pleasant, quiet job; no risk of body or reputation. Stickney, are you willing to join us and receive a fair proportion of the pay? I will give you two hours to reflect," continued Terence, as he looked at his watch. "By that time we will have to start. I am going to take a cat-nap here in the corner. My, how that dog's eyes glare. Any one would think he understood as well as a human being. Now for a doze. Don't let Attobee have too much rum; if you do he will be good for nothing; business first, Jim, and pleasure after." With these admonitions, he settled himself in the corner, and drew his slouched hat over his eyes.</p>
               <p>"It is a good many years, Abel, since I have been in these parts," said Attobee. "I suppose the same old crowd come here?"</p>
               <p>"Not by a long shot," responded Stickney; "that infernal Dawn has ruined my business. You see, he influenced Uncle Bizzle to go to the inebriate asylum, in Jersey, and the old man came back the worst teetotaller you ever met. I had some hopes of winning him over, but Dawn outwitted me by making him his private secretary. Even the good-for-nothing Louie Von Idle has deserted us; they got a hitch on him some way or other; he signed the pledge, and what is worse than all, he kept it. His greed for money has a good deal to do with it; he has learned that hard work brings the shiners—whilst sitting around a bar-room don't keep poverty out of a house. You know how dilapidated and neglected his mother's farm used to be. That's all changed now: the fences are straight, and the premises are well taken care of. Widow Von Idle's farm is the prettiest and most productive in the valley. It's funny for one to be talking against their own business, but, Jim, I know to whom I'm talking."</p>
               <p>"You bet you do, Abel. All your misfortune comes from that temperance lecture. These advocates of charity can only see one side; what do they care for your losses? You had a nice business before they interfered. Dawn might have left the others alone, if he did want to quit drinking himself."</p>
               <p>"A good old crowd it was, too," responded Abel. "But, Jim, I forgot to tell you that the gal that kicked up all the fuss, that Dora Elvesta, or Elvestic, or whatever they called her, didn't get him and his fortune after all. You see, soon after Mrs. Dawn died, Elsie Olcot turns up one day like a<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC5765-00000118"/> ghost, and spoilt her little plan. It seems Dawn was married to Elsie all the time he was courtin' the New Yorker."</p>
               <p>"That's nothing new, Abel; I took out of Dawn's pocket, years ago, his marriage certificate. When he used to get loaded I used to go through him for a little spare change; that's how I came to find it. I thought it might be useful some day, so I kept it in my pocket ever since; it was a tarnation shame that the gal came back; it sp'ilt a nice job for me and Terence. The old gentleman that sent us on this adventure was going to give us a nice sum, if we found Elsie; but it's just my luck, when there is a good stake to be had, something turns up and spiles it. But we have got them this time; there's no slip to this chance. An hour's work will be rewarded by the wealthy old reprobate coming down handsome; the best thing you can do, Abel, is to help us."</p>
               <p>"I would, Jim, if I wasn't afeard of the clutch of the law."</p>
               <p>"Oh! you skeart shadow; do you think that Jim Attobee is a-going to do anything that will shut him in prison? We have the thing all fixed; there's not the slightest danger of detection."</p>
               <p>"I'll take your word for it, Attobee, and will be one of your party."</p>
               <p>"Good; that sounds like a man; now let's have a little sleep, and we will be all the fitter for our work."</p>
               <p>Terence's mind was too much occupied for sleep; he was willing to stake his whole future upon the result of his desperate undertaking. If success rewarded him, he would be no longer De Witt Stranford's servant, but his master. Nothing should thwart his ambition; he would not allow this opportunity to pass unimproved; come what may, he was determined to possess the paper. He would then be able to extort from Stranford whatever terms he liked. He would live like a lord; what a lucky chap he was, to have such confidential business entrusted to him. Stranford has mistaken his man, this time; he thinks Terence a good, stupid fellow; a perfect tool for his foul work; so he is, and a sharp one that will cut both ways. Such thoughts occupied his mind until the clock struck two. He then arose and woke his associates. Terence and Attobee went out to place their horses in a thicket, some distance behind the inn, while Abel replenished the fire, buttoned up his greatcoat, pocketed his revolver, and after taking a general survey, blew out the light, and locked the door. He waited in front of the Friendship for Terence and Attobee, who soon joined him. The three men then walked in silence until they approached the Dawn estate; here they halted, and Terence gave, in a low whisper, his last instruction. Attobee was to watch, and if a light was discovered or noise heard, he was to give the alarm. Terence would enter the house himself, and in case of a surprise, Stickney was to<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC5765-00000119"/> aid in his escape. They proceeded cautiously, until they entered an enclosure in the rear of the homestead, and then crept, cat-like, around the north end, and discovered the light which was in Elsie's room. They drew close together in the shade of a huge willow, and held a consultation. Their voices were muffled by the masks they wore. Stickney and Attobee were for putting it off to another night; but Terence would not listen to it. If they would not aid him, he would attempt it alone, and pocket the stake. Besides, he was willing to do the dangerous part of the work himself; all that he asked was for Attobee to watch the light, and give the alarm if it even flickered. Stickney might conceal himself, but be on the alert and tender aid if wanted. After some hesitation they assented to his plans. Terence commenced operations upon the library window. He took from his pocket a piece of prepared paper, and a bottle of solution, with which he saturated the paper; he then placed the same over a pane, and allowed it a few minutes to dry; then broke the glass without making the slightest noise, and withdrew the paper, with the broken particles adhering. He passed in his hand and pushed back the bolt, opened the window, and crept in. He soon found the escritoire, but its complicated lock was difficult to force without noise. Hark! the howling of a dog broke the stillness of the night; it came nearer and grew louder every moment. What did it mean? Could Carlo have escaped? He became desperate; he would die sooner than lose his prize. He gave the lock a powerful wrench; it parted, the escritoire was opened, its contents overturned, the paper found. The howling of the dog was almost deafening now, and very near the house; Terence, approaching the window, passed out. A light leaped up into the sky, illuminating the country. Attobee and Stickney had fled; his course was intercepted, he was in the powerful grasp of Edmund Dawn. He strove to extricate himself; it was impossible. He became wild with fear; in his frenzy he knew nothing, heard nothing, saw nothing. He raised his knife, then buried it to its hilt in human flesh. The powerful grasp relaxed—he was free—he fled.</p>

               <p>STICKNEY had fastened Carlo in a careless manner to the leg of the stove. After their departure he became enraged, and in his struggles to get free drew the stove around the bar-room, when its legs fell out, thus setting him at liberty. The grate, with its contents of living embers, rolling over the floor, scattered conflagration in every direction. The brute bounded through the low sash of the window, and sped his course, like a deer, toward his master's home, keeping up the most incessant howl. The Friendship was soon wrapt in flames; it was the light of its conflagration that bewildered Terence. The howling of the dog awoke the whole household; Edmund and Elsie were still in the happy reverie in which we left them in a previous chapter. He went quickly out to ascertain the cause of the animal's mal's distress, and in his search for Carlo intercepted Terence's escape. Without his knowledge, Elsie, moved by her love, followed him, determined to battle with any foe that should assail him. She was about to aid him in the desperate struggle, when she discovered, by the light of the flames that were devouring the Friendship, the assassin's poniard raised in the attitude to strike. Quick as thought she threw herself between them, receiving the wound intended for Edmund. He carried her to the library, where every effort that could be devised, was resorted to to stanch the flow of blood; but vain and useless were the attempts. He knelt down, and bent over her, to catch the faintest whisper; without a groan or murmur, her noble life had fled. He bathed her pale features with his tears, and gently closed her loving eyes. Oh! what anguish and horror filled his soul. Elsie, poor, loving Elsie, cold and lifeless; she who had saved him twice, the last time at such a dear expense. What a wretched villain he had been; how cruelly he had treated her; what a life of misery hers—all caused by his own weak selfishness. She, a corpse in the room in which he had kept for years her picture turned to the wall; in the apartment in which he had offered to another her rights as wife and mother. Why did not a just God destroy him? All the mountains of misery in the past melted into sightless vapor, her dishonor and disgrace were gone, nothing remained but pure, noble, loving Elsie.</p>
               <pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC5765-00000121"/>
               <p>The morning light struggled in through the windows and found him still kneeling by the lifeless form.</p>
               <p>Terence, after committing the murder, ran down the broad avenue; on reaching the porter's lodge he left the drive, and took a short cut across the lawn. Approaching the fence, he sprang over it with the agility of a cat, and entering the highway, proceeded toward the grove in which he and Attobee had secreted their horses. The inn, being old, was soon licked up by the fire's forked tongues; and the light of the conflagration dimmed and died in the darkness, before he had reached his destination. Pushing his way through the underbrush, he reached the spot where the horses were tied; here he was confronted by bitter disappointment; Stickney and Attobee had taken the horses and fled. He sank upon the ground, and for a moment was overcome by despair. But fear soon conquered every feeling. In a few hours Mount Glibe and its surroundings would be aroused; the country would be scoured; he would be captured and hanged to the first tree. He arose, and cursing the treachery of his associates, commenced groping his way out of the thicket. On returning to the road, he took an opposite direction from Mount Glibe, and by fast walking and running, put fifteen miles between him and the scene of his crime before the break of day. Early in the morning, he entered a small village, and proceeding to the public-house, partook of a slight repast, and swallowed several glasses of brandy. He then entered a barber's shop close by, had his hair clipped and his flowing beard removed. He exchanged hats with the knight of the razor, and to allay any curiosity or suspicion which he might have aroused, said that he was a seafaring man, that he had been from home for years, and sought to be changed, so that on entering his native place no one would recognize him. Continuing his flight, he kept to the fields and woods; he would have procured a vehicle, but he was fearful of pursuit, for by such a mode of travelling he could easily be traced. About mid-day he entered a dell, in which several men had felled a huge pine. They had gone to dinner, having left their ragged overcoats upon the ground; he exchanged for the most dilapidated, and with his knife made rents in his boots, then besmeared his face with the black mud of the forest. He had a perfect disguise now, in which he could play the part of a beggar, and in this character work his way to New York. When once there, Stranford would have to secrete him, and at the proper time aid him to leave the country.</p>

               <p>ON the very day that Terence completed his disguise, there was a great commotion in Wall Street. Van Vickle &amp; Co. had cornered gold-mining shares; this was the day on which they proposed to squeeze the shorts into a settlement. Mr. Stranford had taken the advice of the elder Van Vickle, and deposited the required amount. Everything looked bright and propitious for the combination. Mr. Stranford went downtown excessively happy—success was certain. Today the battle would be fought; night would bring victory, with its spoils. During the morning hours Van Vickle &amp; Co. called in all their stock, which advanced gold-mining to double its value of the previous day. At this price they demanded a settlement; the small capitalists in the Bear party were compelled to surrender, to save themselves from ruin; but the old Bruins, who controlled large means, refused to settle at any price. Van Vickle &amp; Co. advanced the shares another hundred per cent. and again demanded settlement, which the Bears obstinately refused. In the meantime, a prominent Bear operator advanced the rate on money to a ruinous per cent.; Van Vickle &amp; Co. were sorely perplexed to raise sufficient to carry their collaterals; the hours for banking were drawing to a close; their accounts were largely overdrawn; they were unable to make them good. Before three o'clock their trouble became known in the Stock Exchange. The corner collapsed; gold-mining shares fell off three hundred per cent., and Van Vickle &amp; Co. were irredeemably ruined. Such were the fortunes of a day which had opened with every promise of enormous gains to Mr. Stranford. He had staked all that remained of Dora's wealth upon this venture, and had lost. Leaving Wall Street in a state bordering on desperation, he sought his home, where he tried to console himself with the idea that Van Vickle &amp; Co. would refund to him what they had guaranteed. Joseph Bosway had remained all day in the office, attending to the business of the firm. He had been influenced by Stranford to acquiesce in this venture; and he felt the responsibility which he had assumed. When he received the news of the great fall in gold-mining shares, and the failure of Van Vickle &amp; Co., he became completely prostrated, from which he rallied<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC5765-00000123"/> into a state of wretched misery. In the nobility of his nature, he did not seek to blame Stranford; he only thought of the gross wrong he had aided in perpetrating against Dora.</p>
               <p>A week after, Dora and Joseph took a drive in the Park; Joseph's appearance had greatly altered; he was exceedingly low-spirited, and he avoided conversation. She did not seek to disturb him, and they rode in silence for a long distance, during which he was revolving in his mind whether he should tell her of the loss of her property, or leave it, as Stranford desired, for him to communicate. He decided to act the sneak no longer; he would make a clean breast of it. Turning to her, he began abruptly by stating that the failure of Van Vickle &amp; Co. had affected him seriously.</p>
               <p>"My dear Joseph," replied Dora, "don't take your misfortune so much to heart; I have large means, and they shall always be at your disposal."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Dora; but this disaster has reached further than you imagine; its effects will be felt by many who never contemplated that they were involved."</p>
               <p>"I don't see how that alludes to me."</p>
               <p>"It has taken from you what remains of your princely fortune. Your uncle deposited the last fifty thousand with Van Vickle &amp; Co., and took an interest in the gold-mining combination, which has proved ruinous to all who were connected with it."</p>
               <p>It was a terrible blow to Dora; she was bewildered dered and staggered; she saw herself a beggar through the treachery of her uncle and the counsel of her lover. She would have responded with vindictive wrath, had Joseph not persisted in being heard.</p>
               <p>"Do not say what you may be sorry for; listen! then I will receive your judgment, and not ask for a pardon."</p>
               <p>He related how he had been influenced to counsel Mr. Stranford to venture the remnant of her wealth; he assured her he had nothing to gain, he had simply hoped the venture would have proved profitable, so that she might have had her own, unimpaired, and that her uncle could have been relieved from his embarrassments. He did not seek to shield himself; he was fully aware of the enormity of his offense; he would not ask or hope for her forgiveness. He had saved, through years of weary toil, a few thousands, which he would give her, with the exception of a hundred or more. With this he intended to procure a passage to Europe. His life was blighted; he sought to flee from the influence of Stranford—to live where he could act as his conscience dictated, and not be hampered by craftiness.</p>
               <p>With womanly instinct, she perceived that he had only been a tool in the hands of her crafty uncle; she could not reasonably attach to him any blame; when he spoke of giving her his hard earned savings she was melted to tears. The thought of his leaving her alarmed her more than the loss of her<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC5765-00000124"/> wealth. He was all that she had to cling to now; if he was determined to leave the country to avoid her uncle, she was resolved to go with him. She looked into his face, her eyes suffused with tears.</p>
               <p>"You would not leave me in this hour of trouble—you who have ever been dearer than a brother. Joseph, I expect to become your wife. I have acted giddily and foolishly; for years I have been absorbed in a life of thoughtless fashion; I have often given you pain, evaded you many times; but through all I loved you, and always considered our engagement sacred. I forgive you a thousand times. You have been misled and deceived by a man who now shows himself in his true character. I perceive his motive in implicating you. He undoubtedly hoped that my love and consideration for you would be the means of sparing him. You must act as I direct. I mean to save all I can from the wreck. Van Vickle &amp; Co. are not as badly off as they would lead people to suppose. You must demand an exhibition of accounts from DeWitt Stranford, and also the receipt, which Van Vickle &amp; Co. would be glad to redeem at a third of its value. My father's will empowers my uncle as executor until my marriage. I must become your wife." She hesitated for a few moments, then continued, in an agitated voice, "We have no time to lose; drive to Rev. Dr. Hall's."</p>
               <p>"Dora," interrupted Joseph, "do not seek to do in haste what may cause a life-long regret."</p>
               <p>"Joseph Bosway, do you think that for all the world I would marry a man I did not esteem and love; it is humiliating enough for me to require this hasty marriage, without being perplexed by your remonstrances; besides, it is not like a sudden freak; we should have been man and wife years ago, if I had been true to my promise." She broke into a flood of tears. He tried to console her, and headed his horse for the clergyman's residence.</p>
               <p>She dried her tears, saying it was for their mutual interest, so that he could be empowered to act as her agent; after the ceremony they could easily arrange matters.</p>
               <p>"My uncle will have no other alternative, on the presentation of your authority, than to give up whatever he possesses of mine. After we have gathered up the few fragments that remain, I will cheerfully accompany you to Europe, for, like you, I am anxious to free myself from present associations. We will leave none to mourn our absence; we are both alike destitute of parents and kindred; in a foreign land we can forgive and forget the past. We will be nearer and dearer to each other there than we ever could have been here. I am sure we shall be happy."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Dora! dear, noble, generous girl, it shall be as you desire; may God give me strength to grow more worthy of you."</p>
               <p>They found the Rev. Dr. Hall at home; he assented to their request, without the least remonstrance<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC5765-00000125"/> strance. Dora had long been a member of his flock, and he was confident her motive in seeking such a hasty marriage was instigated by sound judgment which he had no right to question. After the ceremony, he congratulated Joseph upon his good fortune in having gained such a prize, and promised that their marriage should remain a secret until they wished it otherwise. When they reached the Stranford mansion, darkness was supreme. Joseph folded her to his breast, kissed her, and called her his angel wife. The accents of his voice awakened her to reality—a radiant light of joy seemed to surround her, she felt in his embrace that he was the sturdy oak on which she could lean through life's pilgrimage; she never realized how much she loved him till now. Her heart went forth with all the devotedness of a true wife. She entered her home with a brighter face; not even the loss of her wealth could detract from her happiness.</p>

               <p>THE following day Joseph waited until late in the afternoon, before he sought an interview with Mr. Stranford. When they were seated in the private office, he overcame his nervousness, and looking calmly into Mr. Stranford's eyes, said—</p>
               <p>"I am about to perform a painful duty; this paper explains what it is."</p>
               <p>Mr. Stranford examined the power of attorney by which Dora had authorized Joseph to act in her behalf as his judgment dictated. He was startled and perplexed, but he concealed his agitation, and examining the document with a forced smile, replied that, "it was highly gratifying to perceive the confidence Dora had placed in her affianced husband; he would comply with pleasure, but her father's will required him to act as executor until her marriage."</p>
               <pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC5765-00000126"/>
               <p>"This will release you from that trouble," interrupted Joseph, as he presented the marriage certificate.</p>
               <p>Stranford was momentarily dumbfoundered; he arose and exclaimed, in a towering rage—</p>
               <p>"You low-born villain, is this your gratitude? You sneaking coward, how dare you betray my confidence? Plotting against me in my own house; clandestinely marrying my niece, then seeking to expose and disgrace me. Out of my sight." He seized Joseph by the arm and made an effort to eject him.</p>
               <p>"No violence, sir," said Joseph, calmly and respectfully, "I may forget your age; remove your hands from my person." There was something in his voice that made Stranford release his hold at once.</p>
               <p>"What I require is justice; neither Dora nor myself wishes you any harm; she simply desires an account of your stewardship, and Van Vickle &amp; Co.'s receipt."</p>
               <p>"You presumptuous bastard."</p>
               <p>"Stop," exclaimed Joseph, with a voice of authority. "I care not for your abuse, but don't cast insinuations against my mother."</p>
               <p>"Your mother, you never saw her," retorted Stranford, with a sarcastic sneer.</p>
               <p>"You shall not insult the idea which I cherish of her." A wild fire flashed from his black eyes, and in the presence of his rage DeWitt Stranford trembled.</p>
               <p>"I must and will see him," remonstrated a voice in the front office.</p>
               <p>"He has no time to waste on beggars," was the clerk's reply. A slight scuffle ensued, the persistent beggar forced his way to the door, and so lustily did he hammer, that Mr. Stranford was compelled to answer by opening it. Without the least hesitation the intruder entered, and turning quickly, closed the door in the clerk's face. Mr. Stranford and Joseph viewed him with wonder.</p>
               <p>"You don't know me; good; that shows the perfection of my disguise." He removed his hat, which had partly concealed his countenance, and they discovered Terence.</p>
               <p>"Great God," cried Mr. Stranford, turning a deathly hue; "what does this mean? speak, man, what has befallen you?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing, except that in executing your bidding, I shed blood."</p>
               <p>"Oh! Terence, how could you be so rash?"</p>
               <p>"No time to explain; I must have means for escape; give me immediate aid, or they will capture me."</p>
               <p>"I will not shield nor help you to evade the just retribution of your crime."</p>
               <p>"Very well," said Terence, "I shall be taken, and <choice>
                     <sic>coufession</sic>
                     <corr>confession</corr>
                  </choice> is good for the soul."</p>
               <p>"Stop," cried Mr. Stranford; "how much will you require?"</p>
               <p>"One thousand dollars within five minutes."</p>
               <pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC5765-00000127"/>
               <p>"Impossible; it is beyond my power."</p>
               <p>"Then I shall hang, and you will go to State Prison as my accomplice."</p>
               <p>Mr. Stranford shook with emotion. He appealed to Joseph to save him, to spare his child; to consider her beauty and youth, and not allow her to be blighted by a father's dishonor. Falling down, he clasped Joseph by the knees, and besought him in the most imploring manner.</p>
               <p>Joseph was too noble for revenge; he forgave the gross insults he had received a few moments before, he only saw the wretched misery of a fallen man, and his compassionate heart was ever ready to alleviate the sufferer. These promptings saved DeWitt Stranford.</p>
               <p>Joseph, feeling crushed and despondent by the revelations of the day, sought his chamber early in the evening. His sad reflections here were interrupted by Miss Danton's rapping at his door, and informing him that a strange man insisted upon seeing him.</p>
               <p>"It is Terence," he muttered; "show him up."</p>
               <p>Terence entered Joseph's apartment in a different mood from the bravado he had exhibited a few hours previous.</p>
               <p>"I am lost," he exclaimed; "they have traced me; my escape is impossible; they will capture me before morning; oh! Mr. Bosway, protect me; you, who have always been so kind and generous, don't turn your back upon poor Terence; promise you will come to him when he is in prison, and by your influence and power endeavor to save him from an ignominious death. I am too wicked to die, sir. I cannot meet my Maker in so short a time as justice will give me to prepare. Oh! merciful God, why was I not spared from the clutches of DeWitt Stranford?—he tempted me, and my ambition made me his willing tool. Thank heaven, Mr. Bosway, your uprightness and integrity saved you from any implication in his vile plots. Here is the thousand which you furnished for my escape: it is useless; if you don't protect me, I will confess immediately after my capture. The villany of DeWitt Stranford shall be exposed. His family will be disgraced; Miss Elveston will also receive her share. You cannot blame me. If my friends desert me, I must strive and save myself at their expense."</p>
               <p>"For the sake of the innocent only will I defend you, and use every effort to save you from the death which your crimes merit."</p>
               <p>"God bless you, Mr. Bosway. The deed was not premeditated; I struck without knowing; it was only yesterday that I learned my victim was Mrs. Dawn. I must go, I would not be taken here. This manuscript is the document which Mr. Stranford covets; read it, you will then know the depths of his wickednesss. You shrink from it because it is stained with human blood. I don't wonder; it has required all my resolution to conceal it beneath my coat; its bulk keeps its presence in my mind; it has<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC5765-00000128"/> been a great coal of fire, burning into my very heart."</p>
               <p>With a shudder, Joseph took the manuscript, and Terence departed in haste. An hour or more elapsed before Joseph felt inclined to peruse the document which had come so strangely into his hands. He read it with great care, each succeeding page engrossing him more deeply. He finished, and re-read it slowly; then laid it down. There was a wild, unnatural glare in his eye, his features had lost their usual expression, the color of his face had faded to an ashy whiteness. The perusal revealed to him a secret which made his life unendurable. There was no bright hope; even Dora's love was no compensation to him now. The charm of life had fled, and his grief would go with him through life. The anguish which filled his mind had crazed him, and given such a gloomy hue to the future, that self-destruction seemed preferable to existence. Taking his pen, he wrote:</p>
               <p>"MY DEAR, DARLING WIFE,—I have discovered my parentage from a paper which Terence handed me; I am lost in the abyss of despair. Existence is irksome; forgive me for leaving you so soon, forgive your ever-loving, your poor, lost husband, no longer Joseph Bosway, but JOSEPH RAY."</p>
               <p>He arose and procured from the closet two tin boxes. To one he consigned his private papers and effects; in the other he placed the manuscript; he then locked them both, and wrote on a piece of paper: "To be opened in the presence of Edmund Dawn." He glued this label to the lid of the box which contained the manuscript. He then took his brace of pistols and faced the glass. There was a slight hesitation, a momentary nervous trembling of the frame; a dark shadow passed over his countenance; he muttered: "No one shall read in my face the agony of death." He placed a pistol on each side of his face, and fervently breathed, "God have mercy on my soul." A loud report broke the stillness of the night, and aroused Miss Danton's household. Forcing open the door, they found the lifeless body of Joseph Bosway. The morning papers announced his demise, and an astonished public wondered what incentive had induced the Hon. Joseph Bosway, whose voyage of life promised to prove so brilliant and successful, to end his own existence. The Stranford mansion was alarmed early in the morning. Dora received and read Joseph's epistle before rising. The terrible information threw her into convulsions, which, after a day's duration, terminated in a low fever. During this critical juncture, Mr. Stranford never deserted her bedside, not even for his meals. Day after day, and week after week, when her life hung by a thread, the wretched man sat and watched. Dora had always worn the locket which Mrs. Dawn had given her; often, in hours of loneliness, she derived great comfort from gazing at the beautiful likeness which<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC5765-00000129"/> it contained. Mr. Stranford's curiosity was excited; he examined the locket, and was greatly moved when he discovered the miniature of his sister's youthful friend. He had loved his sister devotedly; the picture awakened the softer and better part of his nature. Dora also bore such a strong resemblance to her mother that he was startled, and wondered at his blindness, that he had not discerned it before. It was this resemblance that made him Dora's devoted nurse. When she slept, he would often bury his face in his hands and weep bitter tears of repentance. When she commenced to improve, a weight seemed lifted from his heart; but still he was greatly depressed. It was many months before Dora was herself again. In the meantime, Terence had been captured, convicted, and hung; but strange to relate, died without implicating Mr. Stranford.</p>

               <p>THE elder Van Vickle made all manner of promises to Mr. Stranford; he quieted the uneasiness of the latter gentleman, by stating that he expected large sums which were due from various correspondents in the West; that when they were received, he would be able to redeem the receipts which he had given him, and also to liquidate all his indebtedness. At any rate, he would take care of his old friend. Mr. Stranford, having no other alternative, acquiesced, and humbly added, that his confidence in the integrity of Van Vickle &amp; Co. was unshaken. In this manner, the old banker appeased his anxious creditors, whilst he accumulated a large fortune from the assets of his firm, after which he absconded to Europe. Upon Harry Van Vickle devolved the care of conducting his mother and young brother to the destination selected by his father. A few evenings previous to their departure, Vinter rang the bell of their palatial<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC5765-00000130"/> tial mansion, and demanded an interview. Harry was sorely perplexed, and tried to evade his former friend; but the persistent Vinter would not believe he was out, and without regard to the butler's remonstrances, insisted on remaining until his master should return. Van Vickle, to corroborate the assertions of the butler, stole down into the basement, passed out into the street, and entered by the main entrance, much to the surprise of Vinter.</p>
               <p>"Look here, Van Vickle, old boy, you served me nicely yesterday; I waited all day in your banking house, but you did not appear, as you promised. Is that the way you intend to use me, after all my friendship for you? I will soon teach you manners; you need not think you are going to escape me, as your governor did. I won't take any more pledges; I want my money; you know what I deposited with your father's concern was the last of the princely fortune left me by the old gentleman. I told you so at the time, and when you inveigled me into the infernal speculation of gold-mining, you said I should be protected, come what may."</p>
               <p>"So you shall; you see, the governor was so complicated that he had to leave suddenly; but previous to his departure, I explained to him your condition. He said he would make provision on the other side, which will restore to you your wealth; you must be patient, Vinter; all will be settled satisfactorily."</p>
               <p>"How can a man be patient who has not a dollar in his pocket? Every one is aware that the suspension of Van Vickle &amp; Co. has ruined me; my friends all give me the cold shoulder, and my landlady has intimated that I must settle my last month's arrears, or find other quarters. It is hard on me, Van Vickle, old boy. I was never brought up to work, and can't find any occupation in which I can earn a living. Besides, I am completely broken down; my fast life has shattered and ruined the robust constitution which I inherited; my physician says that it is only by great care I can prolong my existence. Ever since May Greenly disappeared, things have been going down-hill with me; more than likely it's a just retribution for the manner in which I treated her. I suppose if I had married her, I should have escaped these calamities; the old saying is always true: 'there's no rest for the wicked.'"</p>
               <p>"Nonsense, Vinter; your treatment of the girl has nothing to do with your present condition; it is the black bottle that is playing high stakes with you; why can't you be sensible like myself and the other boys? We use it for enjoyment, and don't let it get hold of us."</p>
               <p>"That is just the way I used to talk, Van Vickle. All of you smarts will be clutched before you know it."</p>
               <p>"Oh! but you gave way to it. A man with a good head cannot be captured."</p>
               <pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC5765-00000131"/>
               <p>"But, old covey, how long will a good head last, if its owner puts into his mouth what steals the brains away?"</p>
               <p>"That is the point, Vinter; keep your eye on the mark, and you are all right."</p>
               <p>"A nice time a fellow would have, looking at a mark, when his eyes get dim. There is no use arguing this point any further; we look at it with different optics. To return to our former talk: I wish you would manage to let me have a hundred or two by Saturday. Landladies must have their pay, or out into the street their boarders go."</p>
               <p>"I will arrange that for you, Vinter."</p>
               <p>"It is a small bite of the cherry, Van Vickle, but it is better than a street lodging for Sunday."</p>
               <p>The next day was Friday, and Van Vickle was very active. On Saturday he was huddled with his mother and brother in a small state-room of one of the Cunarders. For hours did they remain in confinement, not venturing out until the cry of all ashore was heard, and the Leviathan had left her moorings. As the last hawser was thrown over, Van Vickle went to the stern of the ship, and among the motley crowd on the dock discovered Vinter. The sad countenance of his friend caused him a momentary pang. He regretted that he had acted so despicably, by deserting him without leaving him a dollar; but by and by the shore grew dim and faded, with it the sad face had gone, and the vast waste of the Atlantic soon separated him from the life he had led. A brisk breeze drove him into the main saloon; he scrutinized the faces of his fellow-passengers, and resolved to be as lighthearted and happy as ever.</p>

               <p>PEEPING into the Dawn mansion, we discover that Aunt Betty has returned from Makeland, and is again housekeeper. Uncle Bizzle has also found a home in Edmund's domicile, and is Amy's instructor. Edmund's public duties rendering it impossible for him personally to attend to her advancement, he was willing to entrust it to Uncle Bizzle, not only on account of his scholastic attainments, but also because of the interest and pleasure which the old man took in Amy's society. Besides, he was continually from home, and during his absence it required a judicious old man like Uncle Bizzle to care for his interest. Amy was no longer the little prattler which had come to Mount Glibe. She had grown remarkably large for her age, and in culture was considerably beyond her years. Her old-womanish ways gave strangers the impression that she was older than she really was. Such were the occupants of the Dawn mansion when, early in the spring of 1861, the nation was awakened from its long sleep of security by the attack upon Fort Sumter. The spirit of patriotism and sacrifice which fired the heart of the loyal North had aroused Mount Glibe to preparation for war; the rolling drum and shrill fife resounded through its dells and echoed against its rocky crags; the banner of liberty waved from every housetop. A meeting was called by prominent citizens to advocate the necessity of aiding the Government in its peril. Thousands assembled upon the village green. The Hon. Edmund Dawn with passionate eloquence aroused the populace to the danger of the hour. A thousand young men, the strength and flower of the country, chose him for their chieftain. Every expedient was resorted to to secure their immediate departure, and the Rangers of Mount Glibe were among the first regiments that mounted the defences of the nation's capital. On a bright morning in May a sorrow-stricken people assembled upon the green. Mothers, wives, sisters, and sweethearts breathed out their parting prayers. Some, in the old Spartan spirit, calmly aided their loved ones in the choice of trusty weapons; while others, overcome by their premonitions that this was the last parting, gave way to feelings of despair. The tears and wailings of the women in their agony illustrated true patriotism, pure, sacrificing devotion to country. The last kisses and embraces were exchanged. The<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC5765-00000133"/> command was given, and the regiment was moving to the seat of war. Down the mountain-side they marched, followed by kindred and friends. Their burnished bayonets glistened in the sunshine; proud and triumphantly floated their banners in the breeze. The strains of martial music struck a responsive chord in each man's heart, which made him a hero for the strife. Edmund, with his usual calm demeanor, rode at the head of his regiment. He was mounted upon a black charger of splendid mettle. By his side rode Amy; her horse was not so powerful as his, but possessed equally fine spirit. Her habit was of black cloth; she wore a soft regulation hat looped up at the side with a silver star, and ornamented with a long white feather. Her gauntlets and horse's bridle were made of the whitest buckskin. When she learned that her father was chosen Colonel of the Mountain Rangers, and had decided to accept, she tried to persuade him to change his mind. On discovering that she could not prevail, she threw her arms around his neck, and, with a flood of tears, declared she would go and die with him. His expostulations, commands, and entreaties were of no avail. He finally consented to her accompanying him as far as Washington, in hopes that a few weeks of camp life would convince her of the absurdity of her resolution, and induce her to return home.</p>
               <p>It is needless to trace Edmund Dawn's misfortunes and successes during each interval of the great struggle. A few scenes of the closing year of the war, however, were memorable and important enough to be recorded. One evening, after a day of weary marching, General Dawn was ordered to report immediately at head-quarters. He entered the commanding general's tent, and found that officer looking over a map.</p>
               <p>"Here, Dawn, here is our position; this is the point," continued the General, sticking a pin into what appeared to represent a ridge of hills upon the map; "if we do not dislodge the enemy from that position, we are defeated and routed before tomorrow's sun goes down. I propose to carry this stronghold by storm. Will your command take the forlorn hope?"</p>
               <p>"I fear General Bigby asks too much," replied Edmund.</p>
               <p>"Is it possible the most intrepid, the bravest general in the army hesitates? You who have won the appellation of 'Mad Dawn!' Oh, Edmund, my dearest friend, my brother companion in arms, we cannot avoid this dreadful expedient, if we would avert an overwhelming defeat. The fate of the country hangs upon the results of our action. If we are vanquished, all the carnage and bloodshed through which we have passed will be of no avail. Think of the millions of treasure squandered, and of the noble lives sacrificed—"</p>
               <p>"I do not hesitate for my own life or safety, but, General, my brave boys—my poor, brave boys—it<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC5765-00000134"/> will be terrible upon them," said Edmund, with tears in his eyes.</p>
               <p>"Better that they should be sacrificed than the whole army."</p>
               <p>"True," sighed Edmund; "it cannot be averted. The Mountain Rangers, under my personal command, will lead the forlorn hope."</p>
               <p>"No, no; you must not think of leading the advance; it will be instant death; the cause of Union and Liberty would be jeopardized by your fall. Your men will fight just as gallantly, if you command from a position of safety."</p>
               <p>"'Mad Dawn,' as you have just addressed me, will never order his boys into a forlorn hope, unless he leads. I could never go back to Mount Glibe knowing that I had not been in the thickest of the fight, and think of the green graves that were made by the conflict of this night."</p>
               <p>General Bigby, embracing him, said, "May the God of battles spare you to receive the gratitude of your countrymen."</p>
               <p>Amy slept upon a rough cot in her father's tent. He had not succeeded in sending her home as he had anticipated. She had determinedly remained with him, and had been near every field of carnage in which he had battled. The hardships of camp life and continual solicitude for her father's safety had given this lovely girl of sixteen a much older appearance. Several exploits had made her a heroine in her father's division. He entered the tent, and stooping down, gently kissed her. He decided not to awaken her. Far better that she should sleep on than be awakened to the tortures and anxieties of this dreadful night. He gazed long and tenderly upon her, and thought how closely she was beginning to resemble her mother. With this reflection he went out, and standing in the pale moonlight, trembled with emotion. Large drops of sweat stood out upon his brow; he tried to calm himself, but he could not; he had a premonition that this was to be his last battle. The moon had risen to its highest, and in the fulness of its mellow light had sketched the shadows of the forest pines upon the hillside; its quiet light seemed to pervade all Nature.</p>
               <p>In deathlike stillness the Mountain Rangers had formed in line of battle behind a thicket. The order being given, they marched out from under cover; with fixed bayonets they advanced upon the enemy's works. The rebels' artillery, with a thundering peal, broke the stillness, and belched forth its shower of death. Exposed to this galling fire, the line hesitated and wavered, but only for a moment. Mad Dawn led, and every soldier would follow him into the very jaws of death. The line again advanced, scaled the parapets, and drove the enemy from the coveted position. Gradually the deep roar of the artillery ceased, and the quiet of night was restored; the pale moon shone as calmly upon the dreadful scene of carnage as it had<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC5765-00000135"/> shone an hour previously upon the quiet, peaceful dell. General Dawn had fallen near the parapet; a piece of exploded shell had shattered his right arm. He became weak from the loss of blood, and was almost unconscious. He was aroused from his stupor by a man who, supposing him dead, was ruthlessly rifling his pockets. He attempted to make a slight resistance. The villain scanned his countenance, and recognizing him, said, with a devilish smile:</p>
               <p>"I will soon end your existence!"</p>
               <p>A quick flash of a pistol, and the would-be assassin fell lifeless on the ground.</p>
               <p>"Who fired that shot and saved me?"</p>
               <p>"I," replied a voice near by.</p>
               <p>"May I inquire your name?"</p>
               <p>"Guy Remington, first lieutenant, Fourth Alabama."</p>
               <p>By this time Lieutenant Remington had crawled up by the side of Edmund; he was a handsome youth of nineteen.</p>
               <p>"Are you badly wounded, General?"</p>
               <p>"I fear I shall lose my arm. What is your injury?"</p>
               <p>"A flesh wound in the thigh."</p>
               <p>"Are you aware," continued Edmund faintly, "that you have saved one of your enemies?"</p>
               <p>"I was fully aware that I was protecting the life of Mad Dawn, our deadliest foe, and the bravest man in the Union Army."</p>
               <p>"Why did you spare me?"</p>
               <p>"Because I could not bear to see a man of your courage die such an ignominious death."</p>
               <p>The terrific war of artillery awoke Amy from her slumber. When she learned that her father was the leader in the thickest of the fight, she sank down in her girlish weakness, and prayed for his deliverance. After the cessation of hostilities, learning that he was among the missing, she instigated an immediate search and discovered him with his noble defender in a fainting condition. Both were carefully removed to Edmund's tent, where their wounds were promptly attended to.</p>
               <p>After this midnight engagement, the two great armies lay inactive, watching each other, for weeks. It soon becoming apparent to General Bigby that the enemy, having received large reinforcements, were preparing to act on the offensive, he made preparations for a general assault, by concentrating on his centre both his right and left wings. The day after he re-formed his line of battle, the enemy drove in his pickets, and advancing their entire line, brought on a general engagement. Hour after hour of dreadful strife ensued, in which neither side gained advantage. The rebels charged and re-charged the Union lines without being able to break them. Late in the afternoon the sounds of artillery ceased, the rattle of musketry died away. This was the hour of suspense; the crisis of the conflict had arrived; the enemy were dressing up their shattered ranks, preparatory<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC5765-00000136"/> to their last final charge. General Bigby knew this would be the decisive struggle of the war. Could the Union line resist another desperate, furious attack? The reports of losses and demoralization which came in by every aide made him tremble for the consequences. In the death-like stillness a faint and distant cheer comes up from the extreme left. It comes nearer and grows louder. It finally breaks into a storm of vociferous cheers, which make the rocky dells vibrate and tremble. A man rides down the Union lines; his black charger is covered with foam; his long hair streams in the breeze; he holds aloft the stump of a shattered arm.</p>
               <p>"It is Mad Dawn, God bless him!" is heard on every side. "He has come to save the day."</p>
               <p>Tears stood in every eye, and in their joy comrades embraced each other.</p>
               <p>Edmund, placing himself at the head of the Mountain Rangers, cried,</p>
               <p>"Follow me, and save the day!"</p>
               <p>With wild cheers the men bounded after him. On they rushed across the green fields covered with the slain, into the very jaws of death. The rest of the division was fired by their courage, and with a loud huzzah, made a charge that swept the enemy from their position. The victory was complete; the rebels were dismayed and panic-stricken; their army suffered a general rout, in which thousands were captured, and the broken remains of their once invincible force entered the city of Richmond like a disorganized mob.</p>
               <p>On the morning of the battle when Mad Dawn heard the rumbling of artillery, in spite of his attendants he arose from his couch in the hospital, and on his black charger rode twenty miles and saved the day!</p>

               <p>JUST you wait until the schoolmarm comes," cried a bright, laughing little girl; "she will trounce you soundly for kissing the girls."</p>
               <p>This was addressed to a roguish-looking boy, whose black eyes flashed out more than usual fire.</p>
               <p>"Oh, you tell-tale; I don't care; let her wallop. I am General Dawn; pa says I am going to be like him. When he was a boy he didn't care how much they walloped him, and if I do I won't be like him."</p>
               <p>The young rascal commenced pulling the golden locks of his remonstrating schoolmate, to which she strenuously objected, much to the merriment of the other scholars. By and by the teacher came; the roguish boy skulked off into his corner, and the bright, laughing little girl, without alluding to her trouble, welcomed her with a kiss. The school opened with worship; the first hour was devoted to writing, during which their teacher read aloud from the newspaper. She was well posted in regard to the war; better informed than any man in the village as to the position of the armies and the abilities of the Generals. When the church-bells rang for a Union victory, she never hesitated to grant a holiday. Writing was followed by spelling, history, geography, and arithmetic. These studies, with French twice a week, composed the routine of each day. Occasionally, after school, the teacher and her favorites would go down to the beach and have a right merry time by the side of old ocean.</p>
               <p>One morning the school was opened as usual; the children were employed in writing; the teacher took up the morning paper, and, previous to reading aloud, ran her eye over the headings of the news from the seat of war. Her heart fluttered, but she conquered her emotions, and muttered the last words of a paragraph which had startled her—"An amputation—an empty sleeve—for our brave Dawn." She did not read aloud, but put the paper away, and went through the duties of the day mechanically. Some of the scholars observed her paleness, but refrained from inquiring the cause.</p>
               <p>Several weeks after, on a Sunday evening, the huge bell that hung far up in the spire of the Methodist church, proclaimed the approaching hour of worship. The Rev. Dr. Alton was Milton's favorite<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC5765-00000138"/> vorite, and the villagers flocked every Sabbath evening to hear his eloquent discourses. Among the assemblage was the school teacher, for she was one of the Doctor's most enthusiastic admirers. The preacher began with a prayer which was touchingly beautiful. It came from a noble, loving heart—a heart overflowing with Christian sympathy for the dying and wounded on the field of carnage. It created in the audience a deep feeling of reverence. After his prayer, he informed his hearers that a terrible battle had been fought, and that the slaughter had been so great that it had completely unnerved him, and rendered it impossible for him to preach. He advised them to go to their homes, and in their closets seek consolation from Him who rules in tempest and sunshine, in peace and war. With a benediction he dismissed them; they congregated around the portals and approaches of the church, and with whitened faces and trembling lips waited for the good doctor, that they might learn more of the desperate conflict. Hours wore on, and the gathering had dispersed. Midnight found the village hushed in stillness, but not in sleep. Few slumbered, for each home had its dear one fighting for the cause of humanity and Union. The next day came with its bright sun and its long list of dead and wounded. In the deep sorrow and affliction that ensued, the little school teacher was the beam of consolation. Her gentleness and tender, soothing ways, comforted the poor sufferers in their bereavements. School was suspended for a week; and the first morning of its resumption the school-mistress, as usual, took up her paper, but almost immediately laid it down. Her face had lost its color and hopefulness. The scholars were soon affected by the change, and deserting their tasks, crowded around their dear teacher. The little girl with the golden locks wept bitterly, and the boy with the roguish eyes hoped he had done nothing wrong. The teacher covered her face with her hands, and remained for a few moments trembling in their midst.</p>
               <p>"I am better now; go home, dear children; my thoughts will render it impossible for me to hear you to-day."</p>
               <p>They withdrew quietly in small groups, and presently she was alone. She folded the paper, and putting it in her pocket, passed out and locked the school-house door. It was a beautiful day; weeping willows drooped their branches across her path; birds sang their joyous lays in the thicket, but her heart was very sad. She did not go to her home, nor did she seek the closely settled portion of the village. She avoided both, for she desired to be alone. Down by the sad sea she roamed; behind an old barren rock, which had stood the splash of waves for ages, she seated herself in the loneliness which she desired. With much hesitation and fear she drew the paper from her pocket, and read the following:</p>
               <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC5765-00000139"/>
               <p>"We are compelled to announce with feelings of the deepest sorrow, that the hero of our recent victories, the brave and intrepid General Dawn, is lying near the point of death, from relapsing fever, at his beautiful home in the mountain region of Pennsylvania. After the amputation of his arm, he was progressing towards a speedy recovery, until the morning of the last great battle, when, in spite of his hospital attendants, he arose and rode twenty miles to save the day. It would be impossible to estimate the disaster which the Union cause would have sustained, but for his timely presence. His rashness, however, which saved us from an irredeemable, overwhelming defeat, caused a severing of the ligaments of his wound; a fearful loss of blood ensued, and his system being reduced from its former vigor, he sank into the dreadful disease which has taken so many of our braves to their final homes. Let us pray with devout fervor to the All-wise Dispenser, that he may live to wear the laurels which the hearts of his grateful countrymen have entwined around his brow."</p>
               <p>Hot tears flowed down her cheeks. She recalled every incident of her intercourse with him. She had vowed, when blessed with wealth and friends, that she would strive to forget him; but now, when want had superseded wealth, and compelled her to teach for her livelihood, and friends with heartless indifference forgot her, she yearned for his brotherly love, but was too proud to make known her present position, lest he might misconstrue her meaning, and imagine that she in her poverty sought his aid. Oh! how foolish she had been! In a few short years how many vicissitudes and sorrows had come to her. Edmund dying, and she hundreds of miles from his bed of suffering. She had promised to be a sister to him. She had been false, and had not kept the vow she had made to Mrs. Dawn upon her death-bed. With a sudden impulse, she sprang from the rock, and brushing away her tears, went to her home with a heavy heart.</p>

               <p>HER hand rested upon the green wicket gate, that closed the entrance to the home of her childhood; the huge knocker and doorknob glistened in the waning sunlight; the lofty elms still stood like sentinels on each side of the doorway, and the descendants of the robin-red-breasts which delighted her in girlhood, had built their nests in the same old nooks of the aged trees. On the stoop sat Miss Danton, engrossed in her knitting; she had promised to furnish the sanitary commission a large number of socks in the coming fall, and felt it incumbent on her to devote diligently every moment to their production, feeling that each pair would add to the comfort of some noble defender. She did not raise her eyes when Dora opened the wicket, and took a seat beside her; but after an interval of silence, looked up, and exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"La! child, what ails you? you are as white as a starched shirt bosom."</p>
               <p>"Oh! my heart, my broken heart, he is dying," and she clasped her hands, and sank her head upon them.</p>
               <p>The almost finished sock and the knitting needles fell, and the ball of yarn rolled into a flower-bed—for the busy fingers that plied them, and kept each in its place, were softly stroking Dora's head.</p>
               <p>"Come, tell your old friend all; who is it that is dying?"</p>
               <p>"Gallant, brave, noble Edmund Dawn, and I miles away; I, who promised to be a sister to him."</p>
               <p>"Why do not you go to him?" was the gentle response.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I cannot, I cannot; I forsook him in affluence, I cannot go to him in poverty; I cannot tell what associations time has placed around him; they would misconstrue my meaning; they would not receive me; they would not allow me to soothe his dying pillow."</p>
               <p>"If I were you," said the old lady, after she had removed her spectacles, and wiped the moisture from her eyes, "I would put aside pride and fear, and go to him."</p>
               <p>There was something in this remark that broke the spell of Dora's delusion; two hours later, she was travelling at lightning speed towards Mount Glibe. The next day Miss Danton did not apply herself so closely to her knitting; she had to wipe<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC5765-00000141"/> her glasses too often. She tried to divert herself by watching the twittering swallows; but the thoughts that harassed her would not be dispelled. Her poor, dear Joseph seemed to be very near, whispering to her in the soft summer air; again, she saw the gentle, loving boy, who came to her in poverty, fatherless and motherless; she saw him ripen into noble manhood, and from his obscurity rise to honor and distinction. Then came the horrid end, which had cast Dora and herself into the sorrow and affliction that had drawn them together, and made them more than friends. Years had passed since that dreadful morning, and in each other's love they had reared some buds of peace and hope, which now she feared would wither away and leave her desolate and alone.</p>
               <p>Never did a mother watch and nurse her sick and dying offspring with more devotion and tenderness than Dora did Edmund. For weeks she sat by his bedside, forgetting everything but his suffering. Oh, how she cherished the hope that he might be spared! for he was more than life to her. The crisis came; he lay cold and rigid. Dr. Miller placed his hand over the dying man's heart, and solemnly shook his head.</p>
               <p>"No, no, it cannot, must not be," cried Dora; and in her wild agony she applied every restorative that could be devised. Her efforts of an hour were rewarded by a slight trembling of the eyelid, which renewed her hope, and increased her exertions. Warmth gradually came back to the rigid form; the pulsations became distinct and strong, and Edmund Dawn returned to life. It was a long, tedious progress which brought him to convalescence.</p>
               <p>Dora had been absent many weeks from her little school, and Miss Danton was becoming impatient, and had written, desiring her early return. She sought Edmund in the summer-house, to inform him of her intention of complying, as soon as possible, with the request. She handed him the communication; he read it, looked thoughtfully into her face, then dropped his gaze and remained quiet. Some minutes elapsed, and then he spoke with great agitation. He reviewed the past; his life had been one scene of vicissitudes and trials; he had been beaten down and vanquished many times in the battle of life; but never so overwhelmingly as the morning, years ago, when she had parted with him. The past, with its echoes and vibrations of sorrow and disappointment, must die out upon the morning dawn of a new era; the sweet and inspiriting voice of hope filled his soul, and whispered that the few remaining years of his life might be bright and happy. Dora had removed to a remote corner, and stood with her back toward him, that she might conceal her emotions. She nervously twisted and toyed with a small sprig of honeysuckle which hung out carelessly from the arbor. He approached her, and bent forward so that he could look into her face—she could no longer hide the truth; naughty tell-tales<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC5765-00000142"/> tales in their crystal joy, were stealing down her cheeks.</p>
               <p>"Am I, the poor, old, careworn, scarred, and decrepit soldier, loved as in the days of my vigor and strength?"</p>
               <p>She turned her head to hide the radiant color which suffused her cheek. He drew his remaining arm around her, and folded her close to his throbbing heart. She made no resistance, but sobbingly rested her head upon his shoulder.</p>
               <p>"Am I loved as of yore?"</p>
               <p>It was some time before she succeeded in subduing her agitation, and then her sweet voice murmured that she loved him more devotedly, more tenderly, than ever. A light step approached them; he kissed her, and went out to meet Amy, whom he was awaiting when Dora sought him. After his departure, she remained in the arbor wrapt in a vision of happiness which burst in all its joy upon her, and in its effulgence pictured a life which more than recompensed her for the dreadful suffering of the past.</p>

               <p>MR. JERRY DANIELS entered one of the numerous drinking saloons situated near Fulton Ferry, and called for a little old rye. He did not observe the poor, decrepit wretch who stood in a remote corner, and would have gone out after having his wants supplied, had not the man recognized and intercepted him.</p>
               <p>"Don't you know me?" said the miserable man who confronted him.</p>
               <p>"My God!" he exclaimed, as it broke upon him who his interlocutor was. "What ever brought you to this? Can it be possible that this is the dashing Vinter of the past?"</p>
               <p>"The very same, Jerry; your old pupil, whose agility and prowess you took such pride in."</p>
               <p>"But what has lowered you so?"</p>
               <p>"False friends and rum."</p>
               <p>"Ah, the same old story."</p>
               <pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC5765-00000143"/>
               <p>"Yes, the same old story, Jerry; good-hearted, too lavish, more money than judgment, no occupation, and inherited wealth—these paved the way to the beggary in which you find me."</p>
               <p>"I never imagined you would come to this, Vinter. I thought you would be shrewd enough to keep a certain portion of your wealth."</p>
               <p>"I thought so too, but you see it slipped away. I did what I thought would restore the portion that I had squandered, and lost the little that remained."</p>
               <p>"How was that?"</p>
               <p>"I'll tell you. You remember the chap that came with me once to your house, named Van Vickle, don't you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, it seems to me I do."</p>
               <p>"Well, you see, his father was a great banker, and this Van Vickle professed to be one of my best friends. Why, we were like two brothers, always together. Well, one day he said to me, 'Vinter, why don't you bank with the old man? You will get a large rate of interest, and, besides, have a chance now and then to make a little profitable speculation.' I hesitated, for, fool as I was, I had some doubts as to trusting all I possessed with a Wall Street house; but after a week's consideration, I partially took his advice, and deposited two thousand. I tried my luck, as he called it, and under his supervision doubled what I had deposited. Confound it! that was the only money I ever made, and that was the bait that made me nibble the hook that brought me up high and dry, and ruined me. I became infatuated; disposed of what real estate and securities I had left, and went in heavy. But previous to doing so, I told Van Vickle that I was placing all I had in his father's hands. He laughed at my timidity, and assured me that, come what might, I should never lose a dollar. Then came the great corner in gold-mining stock. If that had succeeded, I should have been richer than ever. You remember the commotion it created in the city, don't you? The rapid advances in the price raised me to the height of joy, and its sudden collapse left me destitute—without a dollar. Van Vickle's old man eluded his creditors and fled to Europe. I was terribly disconcerted, but Harry quieted me by assuring me that what I had deposited should be restored. I believed him, and at the time had no idea that he contemplated following his father. He made several promises to meet me at the banking-office and supply me with sufficient money to provide for my present wants, but failed to keep any of his appointments, and with his mother and brother clandestinely departed to join his father. An old servant of the family took compassion on me, and informed me on the day of his sailing. I hastened to the wharf and arrived just in time to see the hawser cast off and the steamer moving into the stream. That's the friendship I experienced, Jerry, from a man whom I had always treated like a<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC5765-00000144"/> brother. I was penniless; my landlady demanded her dues; I could not pay, so was thrust into the street; and then began my downward career. It is easy for a man to go up, Jerry, for the higher he goes the stronger become his friends; but when he sinks, every one seems to take pleasure in forcing him down. Oh, Jerry, if you only knew what I have been through you would pity me! You see, I have lost all my gayety, and even the slang which I used to consider the only language for a sport. All my friends have deserted me—all except an indigent old man who used to be a porter in my father's store. I got so low I had to apply to him, and I have lived on his charity for the last six weeks; but it is pushing him dreadfully. He, noble, generous soul, would not say so if I took his last crust. He has a little cottage on the outskirts of Brooklyn. Jerry, lend me a few dollars, so that I can show him some gratitude."</p>
               <p>"You would forget your gratitude, and drink it up."</p>
               <p>"No, I wouldn't; I have not drunk any in two days."</p>
               <p>"Ah! you're only waiting for me to ask you."</p>
               <p>"Don't ask me; I am craving it, and could not refuse. Besides, I promised the Rev. Dr. Hall I wouldn't; he is trying to get me into St. Luke's Hospital; you have no idea how far gone I am, Jerry; you see, my legs swell terribly every night, and my breath is very short."</p>
               <p>"Why, man, you are trying to quit too suddenly. You must take a drink; what shall it be?"</p>
               <p>"Bourbon."</p>
               <p>"Aye, that is right; pour out a big one; that will make you feel more like living than dying."</p>
               <p>"You see, Jerry," said Vinter, after he had wiped his lips with his ragged coat; "you see, I cannot stand much now; the smallest quantity goes right to my head. Ain't you going to lend me some money?"</p>
               <p>"You mean give it you."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, I don't! See, I will put it down in my memorandum book as borrowed."</p>
               <p>"But that won't pay me back. Come, take another drink."</p>
               <p>"I can't, Jerry; it will make me unable to go home."</p>
               <p>"Pshaw! nonsense; a little more won't hurt you."</p>
               <p>"You will be responsible?"</p>
               <p>"I will guarantee you."</p>
               <p>"But I shouldn't, Jerry; I promised Dr. Hall I wouldn't."</p>
               <p>"Don't talk about ministers, but put it away, man."</p>
               <p>"Then you will let me have two dollars?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, anything to satisfy you. There, don't you feel better? Now you see you can stand more than you thought."</p>
               <p>"But, Jerry, you're not going to leave me?"</p>
               <pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC5765-00000145"/>
               <p>"No, boy, I am going across the street to get a bill changed; you be patient for a few moments, I'll be right back."</p>
               <p>When Mr. Jerry Daniels had gained the street, he congratulated himself on having shaken off the drunken Vinter so easily; two drinks, costing twenty cents, was a cheaper way than lending two dollars that would never come back. Poor Vinter waited patiently a long time for Jerry; by and by the poisonous liquor took effect, and the inhuman bar-tender ordered him out. The blackness of a dark night filled the streets, and in his bewilderment he trudged his way to Fulton Ferry.</p>
               <p>"A man overboard," shouted a small boy, and the waiting passengers rushed out on the bridge. In the midst of the commotion, the life-preserver was thrown at a black mass which came to the surface of the water.</p>
               <p>"He cannot reach it," was the cry; "where is the ladder? Quick, or he will drown!"</p>
               <p>The ladder was flung out, but the black mass had gone down, and did not come again to the surface.</p>
               <p>"It is all over," said the ferry-man, crawling up the ladder; "whoever he is he has settled up his accounts—passed in his checks." With callous indifference, he restored the ladder to its rack, and fished the corks up and laid them out to dry. Shortly afterward the boat came in, and bore the waiting passengers away. The turbid water in the slip quieted into its black sombreness, and gave no token of the life that had gone out in its cold embrace. The following day a body was picked up in the Narrows, taken to the nearest police precinct, and thence to the Morgue for identification. The ragged garments were searched, and in a pocket nearest the heart was found a soiled and almost worn-out piece of note paper, on which was the following:</p>
               <p>"I leave you to seek a better, purer, and happier life. I forgive you the cruelty with which you at times treated me. God bless you, and in the end bring you to everlasting life.—MAY."</p>
               <p>No relative, no friend, no claimant, a pine box, a pauper's grave, unknown!</p>

               <p>GRIM-VISAGED war" had ceased; the noble braves "came marching home with glad and gallant tread." City, town, and hamlet throughout the domain of the loyal North were exultant with joy. But above all others, Athens, in Illinois, was wrought up to a frenzy of joy and gratitude. A great general was coming, and every preparation had been made for a festival of welcome. The sun had melted away the night, and the long looked-for day had come at last. Noel Layton had his best team harnessed to his new farm wagon, in which bright golden sheaves of straw of the latest harvest were placed. With the assistance of Ned Enos he was gathering up a load of robust country girls. They stopped for the last time in front of an old-fashioned abode, and a shout went up from the laughing group in the wagon. The door partly opened, and a merry voice cried out, "not a-going." The door closed; a slight shade of disappointment passed over the faces in the wagon, but it disappeared as they left the cottage in the distance, and a happy shout came back to the possessor of the merry voice behind the door. For a moment she sat moody and unhappy on the stairs. "But we could not all go," she muttered. "If I went, father and mother would have been obliged to stay at home." A light kindled her eye, and a pleasant smile parted her lips, for she thought how bright and pleasant they looked after she had helped them into the old chaise drawn by shaggy Billy. She broke out into a joyous song, and went about her household duties. The wash-tub was filled, and in a large heap lay the linen that was to be cleansed, and the little woman looped up her neat calico dress, revealing a pair of small, pretty feet and shapely ankles; she bared her round, plump arms, and commenced with a zest her weekly washing.</p>
               <p>"What a fine time they will have; how I should like to see the fireworks; above all I should enjoy the ball. No, I don't know that I should, for he would be there, and if he should recognize me it would make me wretched, and if he didn't I should be wretched, too; so I should probably have been unhappy, and it is best that I was wise enough to stay home." She broke out again in song, and piece after piece was rubbed, wrung, and thrown into the basket. The large pile had slowly decreased in<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC5765-00000147"/> size; the sun was sinking in the western sky, and the little red knuckles were still rubbing.</p>
               <p>In the meantime, in Athens, the long procession, the firing of cannon, the ringing of church-bells, the cheering of the populace, and the speech-making, had passed off as arranged. Toward evening the great general stole away from his surrounding admirers, and mounting his horse, rode away alone over the hills. After proceeding a few miles he dismounted, and fastened his horse to a neat paling in front of an old house; he then stole cautiously around to the rear, and seeing the little woman who was still rubbing at the wash-tub, touched her lightly on the neck with his riding whip. She turned, and with an exclamation of joy threw herself into the intruder's arms; then indignantly pushed him away, and going to the end of the arbor, seated herself upon a bench and covered her face with her hands, as if seeking to hide her confusion. The General took a seat beside her. By and by he pulled down the little red hands, revealing the handsome face suffused with a color which reflected the loving warmth of her heart.</p>
               <p>"Oh! you cruel man, to take me so unawares."</p>
               <p>"My darling, there's nothing like a surprise either in love or war."</p>
               <p>"But look at my plight."</p>
               <p>"More becoming than the handsomest ball-dress you ever wore."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense! do not talk so ridiculously. How did you find me? How did you know my whereabouts?"</p>
               <p>"Your mother told me you refused to come to the celebration, so I decided that, after the day's festivities, I would ride over here and see if a certain little lady would accompany me to the ball; and if she wouldn't, why, the inhabitants of Athens would know the next day that it was she who had kept the General away."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I can't go; father and mother aren't home, and I have nothing to wear."</p>
               <p>"Is this the only dress you have?" he asked ironically.</p>
               <p>She laughingly replied she "hoped not."</p>
               <p>"Then what is to prevent you from going? I arranged with your father and mother that they were to come home after the fireworks; we can then take the chaise and arrive at the ball at a fashionable hour. You see you are captured, and there is no use in your trying to fight your way out."</p>
               <p>"I suppose I will have to surrender."</p>
               <p>"Most assuredly you will."</p>
               <p>The golden light in the western sky had faded, and the General took advantage of the twilight to steal his arms around the maiden and in his iron grasp imprisoned one of her soft hands. In the rapture of love's dream time flew unheeded by until the rumbling of an approaching vehicle startled them. She went to her room and commenced a hasty toilette, whilst the General lit a<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC5765-00000148"/> cigar and went to the gate to meet the chaise. By and by the moon came out, and the little woman who had labored all day at the wash-tub came into its full light. The fleecy folds of her dress floated around her like a soft white cloud. He looked admiringly at her, and remarked as he handed her into the chaise, that "he thought she had nothing to wear."</p>
               <p>"Neither I have," she saucily responded; "this is an old dress that I rejected years ago. But times have changed, and I don't care, because I am happy."</p>
               <p>The General's lady was the acknowledged belle of the evening. The small hours of the morning had been ticked by the clock when they were again in the chaise. Shaggy Billy took his time in getting home, and when Sadie Stranford parted with General Bigby on the front porch, daylight was streaking the eastern sky.</p>

               <p>BOB, you can go home for the remainder of the afternoon," said an old decrepit lawyer. The boy put away his writing utensils and bounded out of the office with a step quickened by the thought of a few hours of play.</p>
               <p>"Married at last," muttered the old lawyer; "all my intervention for naught. Who would have believed it?" To make sure that he was not in a dream he took up the wedding cards and read them again: "Mr. and Mrs. Edmund Dawn. I wish them joy." He wiped the moisture from his eyes, then went to the closet and brought out an old tin box; after dusting it, he looked at it some time before he opened it. He took a document from it, read it, then put it back and exclaimed, "Oh, DeWitt Stranford, what a wretch you have been!" He locked the box and arose to return it. No one should ever know the magnitude of his crime. But<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC5765-00000149"/> the remorse—the deep remorse—was eating his life out each day; its weight grew heavier on his heart. It was fast dragging him to the grave. He would confess and seek forgiveness, for his conscience would then be quiet and give him rest. He sat down and wrote slowly for a long time. When he had finished the document he inclosed it in an envelope, and put it in the box with the roll of parchment. He wrapped the box in strong paper and wrote an address upon it, then went down the stairs into the street, and, after leaving it at the express office, headed Shaggy Billy towards home.</p>
               <p>Several days afterward Edmund and Dora Dawn were seated in the library and on the table was the old box.</p>
               <p>"What can it mean? 'To be opened in the presence of Edmund Dawn.'"</p>
               <p>"We will soon see," replied Edmund, breaking open the lock and turning the contents on the table. At a glance he recognized the roll of parchment; he sank down in a chair, and rested his head on the table.</p>
               <p>"I will read it," said Dora.</p>
               <p>"No, no; I cannot bear it now."</p>
               <p>"Shall I read it to myself?"</p>
               <p>"If you wish."</p>
               <p>"Here is a letter from Uncle DeWitt also. Shall I read that likewise?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>She went to a remote corner, first perused Mr. Stranford's letter, then the parchment. She arose, went to Edmund, and laid her hand trembling upon his head.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I must tell you; I cannot endure it alone. Mrs. Ray was Joseph's and Elsie's mother, and DeWitt Stranford, my uncle, my mother's brother, is their father." She could say no more, but sank down on her knees beside him.</p>
               <p>A month or more after the reading of Mrs. Ray's narrative, a party, consisting of General Bigby, Lieut. Remington, Miss Sadie Stranford, and Miss Amy Dawn, started for a ride to the highest summit of Mount Glibe. On their return, the Lieutenant and Amy speeded their horses, leaving the General and Sadie to their own reflections.</p>
               <p>"Ralph," said Sadie, after a long pause, "there is one cloud upon my sky of happiness."</p>
               <p>"Pray, what is it?"</p>
               <p>"The remembrance of that evening on which I treated you so cruelly at the President's levee."</p>
               <p>"You thought to deceive me by your haughty airs, but I understood you better than you did yourself. You loved me then, but were too proud to confess it."</p>
               <p>"I believe that was my sin."</p>
               <p>"And it is the thought of this that mars your happiness?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Then I will have to do as Dawn is always doing—forgive you."</p>
               <pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC5765-00000150"/>
               <p>Edmund and Dora took their usual evening walk down to the Old Stone Church. Two more graves had been added to the number—Joseph's and Elsie's.</p>
               <p>After tea that evening, the two Generals in the library smoked their cigars and talked over the campaigns in which they had participated. Dora entertained Sadie in the hall.</p>
               <p>"Do you remember the summer we went to Catskill, Dora?"</p>
               <p>"Most assuredly I do."</p>
               <p>"You have not forgotten how you censured me for saying I would do a large amount of flirting for a ring; and how I wished the silly Van Vickle would go home so that I could win one from the Major?"</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>"Well, I have won the ring and lost my heart."</p>
               <p>"Pa," said Amy, coming into the library, her cheek suffused with color, "I want to tell you something in confidence."</p>
               <p>"What is it?"</p>
               <p>She put her lips close to his ear, and whispered, "Guy Remington kissed me."</p>
               <p>"I am afraid, judging from appearances, for such offences you will ever forgive him," was the reply.</p>
               <p>She tapped him saucily with her fan and went out on the porch to join Guy. Shortly afterward her merry laugh indicated to Edmund that he had judged aright.</p>

               <head type="sub">A New Edition.</head>
               <p>Among the numerous editions of the works of this greatest of English Novelists, there has not been until now <emph>one</emph> that entirely satisfies the public demand..... Without exception, they each have some strong distinctive objection, ... either the shape and dimensions of the volumes are unhandy—or, the type is small and indistinct—or, the paper is thin and poor—or, the illustrations [if they have any] are unsatisfactory—or, the binding is bad—or, the price is too high.</p>
               <p>A new edition is <emph>now</emph>, however, published by G. W. Carleton &amp; Co. of New York, which, it is believed, will, in every respect, completely satisfy the popular demand.... It is known as</p>
               <p>"Carleton's New Illustrated Edition."</p>
               <p>The size and form is most convenient for holding, .. the type is entirely new, and of a clear and open character that has received the approval of the reading community in other popular works.</p>
               <p>The illustrations are by the original artists chosen by Charles Dickens himself ... and the paper, printing, and binding are of the most attractive and substantial character.</p>
               <p>The publication of this beautiful new edition was commenced in April, 1873, and will be completed in 20 volumes—one novel each month—at the extremely reasonable price of $1.50 per volume, as follows:— <list>

                  <item>"Mrs. Holmes' stories are universally read. Her admirers are numberless. She is in many respects without a rival in the world of fiction. Her characters are always life-like, and she makes them talk and act like human beings, subject to the same emotions, swayed by the same passions, and actuated by the same motives which are common among men and women of every day existence. Mrs. Holmes is very happy in portraying domestic life. Old and young peruse her stories with great delight, for she writes in a style that all can comprehend."—<title>New York Weekly.</title>
                  </item>
                  <item>"Mrs. Holmes' stories are all of a domestic character, and their interest, therefore, is not so intense as if they were more highly seasoned with sensationalism, but it is of a healthy and abiding character. Almost any new book which her publisher might choose to announce from her pen would get an immediate and general reading. The interest in her tales begins at once, and is maintained to the close. Her sentiments are so sound, her sympathies so warm and ready, and her knowledge of manners, character, and the varied incidents of ordinary life is so thorough, that she would find it difficult to write any other than an excellent tale if she were to try it."—<title>Boston Banner.</title>
                  </item>
                  <item>"Mrs. Holmes is very amusing; has a quick and true sense of humor, a sympathetic tone, a perception of character, and a familiar, attractive style, pleasantly adapted to the comprehension and the taste of that large class of American readers for whom fashionable novels and ideal fantasies have no charm."—<bibl>Henry T. Tuckerman.</bibl>
