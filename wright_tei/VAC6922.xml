                BABBLETON was an Vacient village near the city of Philadel- phia. It had a wharf
                where the steamboats landed, and a depot where the locomotives whistled. Hence,
                although the principal mansions were situated on commodious lots, and in many
                instances separated from each other by broad yards and close fences, it is not to be
                inferred there was ever a monoto- nous deficiency of noise and excitement in the
                place. It had its proud and its miserable, its vanities and its humiliations its
                bank and its bakers, its millionaires and its milliners; and was not unfrequently
                the scene of some of those entertaining comedies of life, which have been considered
                in all enlightened countries worthy of preservation in veracious and impartial
                history. Such a record we have attempted to produce; and although the direct manner
                of narration adopted may offend the taste of the fastidious critic, yet the less
                acutely discern- ing reader may possibly deem himself compensated for the labor of
                perusal, by the reliable assurance of the authenticity of the story, and the
                interest attending the occurrences flitting before his mental vision. 1 <pb n="2-3" xml:id="VAC6922-00000007"/> 2
                THE WINKLES. At a convenient distance from the trafficking centre of the town, was
                an old, square, two-story brick dwelling, embowered with overhanging trees. In the
                rear and on the south were a few acres belonging to the premises, which had been
                originally planned for a magnificent lawn, but were subsequently, for cer- tain
                reasons, devoted to more useful purposes. The grounds, at the most distant extremity
                from the house, were bounded by a sparkling brook, whose source was in a range of
                hills a few miles distant. This stream had always been, and is yet, as every one
                knows, famous for its abundance of small trout. It was in the glimmer of twilight,
                and the lamp suspended in the hall of the old mansion had been lit by Biddy, the
                widow Winkle's housemaid. The rays illuminated the ancient wainscoting, where some
                forgotten son of genius had once exercised his powers of creation in the production
                of a number of animated pictures, which the commendable taste of the Winkles had
                preserved from the modern invasion of paste and gaudy paper. On one side might be
                seen a party of the early settlers falling into an ambush of the savages; a sketch
                of one of Cromwell's battles with the royalists; and then the execu- tion of the
                conscientious Episcopalian, the unfortunate Charles. On the opposite side were
                landscapes-chasing and angling; and over them, with their frames reaching to the
                ceiling, were half a score of portraits of the Winkle Lamily. A monastic silence
                reigned in the hall. A king Charles spaniel lay upon the floor, with his head
                between his feet, as if patiently awaiting the arrival of his master. The crickets
                came out, but did not sing. A mouse ran noiselessly under the green settee without
                attracting the notice of Dew, whose eyes only wandered from the broad, bright rods
                on the stairway to the huge lock of the front door, without observing that the arms
                of the red warriors were in motion; that Cromwell's unhelmeted brow was assuming a
                darker frown; that the lips of the royal victim on the scaffold were moving in
                prayer; that the pant- ing buck was actually shaking his antlers in defiance, and
                that the floundering trout on the greensward really seemed to be opening and closing
                his gills-which might have been easily perceived by any gazer sufficiently
                imaginative. But although the illuminated hall was so still and silent, one
                apartment, among the many the old mansion contained, exhibited no deficiency of
                animation or mirthfulness. This was the sitting-room of the family. It had large
                bookcases MSS GUSSET. 3 well stored with volumes, in three of its corners, and in
                the fourth, in the good old style, was a fireplace filled with fresh boughs from the
                umbrageous trees in the yard. Mrs. Winkle, a portly widow of some five and fifty
                years, sat in her great high-baced chair beside a dark mahogany centre-table. On the
                opposite side was seated one of the tolerated gossips of the town, a retired
                milliner, a pale, small woman, something beyond thirty years of age, with thin lips
                and a Roman nose, but with an humble expression of eye, and a soft insinuating
                voice-particularly when in the presence of any of her old patrons. Mrs. Winkle had
                in former years contributed liberally to the worldly acquisitions of Miss Gus- set;
                and the latter, for certain reasons, which will appear, was not in readiness to
                repay the obligations she owed with the - ingratitude so generally returned for
                benefits conferred. "Sit still, Gusset," said Mrs. Winkle, smiling, and clip- ping
                off the curl of the wick of the spermaceti candle. ' Thank you, Mrs. Winkle," said
                Gusset, recomposing her- self on the chair from which she had been about to rise.
                "It will afford me pleasure to stay, if my company is agreeable, until they come. It
                is quite time they were here,"--she con- tinued, drawing forth a huge gold watch,
                pending from which were several seals, and a most ponderous pencil case,-" a whole
                quarter past the usual time, I declare I hope no serious accident has happened. If
                so, I know they'll regret not coming in the early boat; and I'm sure I haven't the
                least conception why they staid for the late one, unless they didn't wish to be seen
                in my company. But they needn't have alarmed themselves-I had a book - " "Bravo,
                Gusset! I thought something had occurred to wound your sensitive little heart. You
                have hardly spoken ten words during the last hour, and I doubt whether you have been
                listening to my diverting histories of the parvenue aristo- crats of Babbleton. You
                have not laughed as usual. Pooh, Gusset! You know there is nothing in this world I
                hate so much as a grave displeased visage. Relax your blond features and tell me the
                whole story." ' It's a very short one, Mrs. Winkle, and I don't think it will give
                you pleasure to hear it. I never. like to allude to any thing unpleasant before you;
                you who were born with a smile, as the Honorable Mr. Winkle used to say, and will

                Winkle, still smiling, although tearlets sparkled in the corners of her eyes. "It is
                better to laugh than to cry; and I believe it is quite as acceptable to our Maker. I
                will really strive to be cheerful to the last. They say I have been as mirthful
                since the loss of our fortune as before. I'm glad of it. Ha! ha! ha! The idea of
                laugh- ing on one's death-bed! Well! Suppose one is at peace with Heaven, and has no
                burden on the conscience? A smiling corpse! Really I think it would be better thus
                to strengthen the hopes of the beholders of such spectacles, than to chill them with
                horror. Give me wax candles and beautiful bou- quets. But go on, Gusset-tell me what
                happened in the city to-day." "We had a most delightful time going down. The day was
                beautiful and the company pleasant. Lucy was as gay as an oriole-- "My daughter, you
                know, is what is termed a ' chip of the old block.'" "La, Mrs. Winkle, you are not
                old! You could pass for thirty. And Mr. Winkle "Call my son Walter, or you will
                certainly make me feel old. A boy recently out of college called Mr. " Walter was
                charming "Who was he charming?" "Miss Virginia Oakland, as sure as my name is
                Griselda Gusset!" "Nonsense-mere child's play! Go on." "Mr. Ralph Roland is
                thirty-five, I'm sure-so he's-no child. Well, he played against Walter, and Walter
                won." "Pooh! Some people think Rolandis playing for Lucy. If I thought so, I'd soon
                put a stop to the game!" "Why, after Mr. Plastic, and the emperor-I mean your
                brother-in-law, Mr. Napoleon Winkle-he is thought to be the richest man in the
                country." "No matter, Lucy's heart is above all price. Never marry for money,
                Gusset." "Not I My income, from what I have been able to lay up with your aid, and
                the patronage of others, is enough to keep me comfortable, and independent, too!
                When we got to the city, Mr. Roland walked with us until we met your sister-
                in-law-the princess, call her-Miss Wilsome Winkle-and you know she's sixty." MSS
                WILSOXE'S PORTRAIT. 5 No such thing, Gusset-no such thing." La! didn't I hear you
                say so yourself the other day, when the emperor-I mean Mr. Napoleon Winkle-her
                brother, said it would be impolite to marry before his sister, wno was two years
                older than himself?" "I said she would be sixty in six weeks, and it has been only
                three since then," replied the widow, laughing very hear- tily. "And you met Miss
                Wilsome while Roland was with you? I wonder she spoke at all." "If you could have
                heard her speak! You know what a raven-like voice she has-but I'm sure she can't
                help it-and with that, such as it was, she said, taking Lucy by the arm, 'Come away,
                child, from that horrible brute!' And she ac- tuallv forced Lucy to go with her!" Ha
                .ha! ha! Just like Wilsome. You imitate her per- fectly. What did Roland say?" "Not
                a word. But he ran into the middle of the street and jumped into an omnibus." "Where
                was Walter?" "With Virginia, behind, laughing himself half to death." "Every body
                knows Wilsome's strange ways. No one cares what she says or does." "Nor herself
                either. I'm sure Mr. Ralph Roland is per- fectly gentlemanly in his manners, a
                handsome man, and as rich as -" "Riches are nothing in WilTome's estimation."
                "Excuse me, Mrs. Winkle, if I venture to think differently. I am convinced that if I
                had been rich, she wouldn't have wished to shake me off as she did!" "Why, Gusset,
                have you not just been saying that Roland was rich, and that she almost thrust him
                into the middle of the street?" "It's a mystery. I can't unravel it." "I can. He
                grievously offended her once. How do you suppose, now, he incurred her displeasure?
                You could never guess. Accompanying some ladies away from her mansion one night, it
                being late, for they had been playing whist, he chanced to tread upon her white
                tom-cat's tail. The animal scratched his ankle, and not knowing exactly what it was,
                for the lady had screamed and overturned the wax candles (she will not have gas), he
                kicked violently, and killed poor Tom. She has never forgiven him, for she has not
                yet been able to <pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6922-00000009"/> 6 THE WINKLES. obtain another cat of the same color and
                disposition. Roland has had some twenty white kittens under the tuition of his
                housekeeper, and does not despair of achievinig a reconciliation. But how did
                Wilsome look? how was she dressed?" "I cannot help it, Mrs. Winkle, but really it is
                painful to look at her. You know I am a simple and an humble wo- man, grateful for
                all the favors you and your family have be- stowed on me, and ever conscious of my
                low origin and inferiority. Of course I could never be so vile as to say an
                ill-natured or malicious thing against any one who assisted me in the time of my
                need; or against any of their friends or connections. Yet when such as you, who know
                my inoffensive disposition, ask my candid opinion on any subject, I feel bound to
                give it. Then, as to Miss Wilsome's form, it is a very good one. Her shape is,
                indeed, elegant, and sets off a dress to perfection. And her feet and hands are very
                fine. But she walks more and more on her heels as she grows older, and it can be
                perceived that her knuckles become more bony. Her face-bless us!-why it is plastered
                over with paint; and yet such crow's feet and wrinkles are seen below her eyes -her
                enormous eyes-down her cheeks and along her neck, that every one who beholds her is
                shocked, absolutely stunned. We feel, alas! that art cannot conceal the frightful
                inroads of age; and it is a very melancholy thought, Mrs. Winkle, for we are all
                growing older every day." "But just now, Gusset, you were complimenting me-- "Oh,
                you don't show age, because you are always merry. I wish I could grow fat, too!"
                "You must be merry, first. Yet my sister Wilsome is often very merry." "I fear it is
                only on the surface, madam; a mere imita- tion of the young miss, and it is horrible
                to witness it. But forgive me, I would not give offence for the world. And I declare
                when one sees Miss Wilsome's form without looking at her face, she might pass for a
                reigning belle; for she is al- ways arrayed in the most beautiful and costly
                apparel. It is fashionable too. Indeed she generally has an extra flounce or so, and
                I am sure I do not blame her for turning her eyes away when the young gentlemen in
                the street are attracted by her gay exterior, and have an idle curiosity to survey
                her fea- tures. Several such impertinents followed us many squares; sometimes coming
                up even with her, and finding her face al- SHE PAINTS. 7 ways averted when their
                eyes were turned towards it, there was nothing left for them but to fall back again,
                and admire her magnificent form. She did right no doubt to mock them thus. I do not
                blame her for not gratifying their idle curi. osity." "I am afraid, Gusset, you were
                just then a little incensed. What motive can any woman have for displaying a fine
                form and rich attire, and at- the same time concealing from the ad- mirers that may
                be attracted the face of the proprietor? Unless she be known, how can she reap any
                of the credit? Then why go to the expense, and take the pains?" "The pains! True,
                Mrs. Winkle, for I heard her declare she was in an agony. She said her corns were
                throbbing at every step. I declare, as you say, I cannot see the motive. But motive
                or no motive, I have known other ladies to do the same thing. And you know, as soon
                as Miss Wilsome gets within your door, she will, as usual, call for her easy
                slippers. Still, you must not suppose she was harsh to me. Oh no! The moment after
                we entered her fine mansion, and the door closed behind us, she turned round and
                almost smothered me with caresses. To think she should shake both my hands for five
                minutes, as if we had just met, when we had been walking together more than a mile!
                Oh! and she had every thing nice-cakes and wine. She is no prohibitory disciple; but
                it isn't wine that gives her such a color. ' Come, Gusset, I am really rejoiced to
                see you,' croaked she,' take it, dear'-as the silver salver paused before me-- be at
                home in my house, be happy,' and so on." "Gusset, that was Christian treatment." "No
                doubt. Just as many Christians act. Sisters at the communion table-haughty despisers
                in the street. How I long to be rich and in high station, just to give an example to
                the world " "To the world, Gusset? But tell me how Wilsome in- curred your
                displeasure." "Forgive me, Mrs. Winkle; I meant Babbleton, and not the whole world.
                Miss Wilsome was very kind, very, indeed -too kind! Never had I such sumptuous
                entertainment before-never before so splendid a dinner-all ordered I be- lieve from
                a restaurant's, and costing at least five dollars. And when the time came to depart,
                Miss Wilsome, for the first time, let me know she intended to return with Lucy, and

                inconvenience on her account. Oh no! she would not detain mne-she was sorry to be
                separated-but she would soon have the pleasure of my company again, at Babbleton."
                "Ha! ha I ha I And so she will, Gusset." "And when I was endeavoring to get in a
                word to the effect that I was quite at leisure, and altogether disposed to pass the
                remainder of the day: in the city, she was as deaf as a post, and rattled away
                with--' My dear Gusset, I hope your interests may not 'suffer in consequence of the
                time we have detained you here. But I am so fond of your company, and it has been so
                long since we met, that I could not bear to part with you. You shall not lose by it,
                Gusset. I hope your apprentices will not do any mischief in your absence-and that no
                customers may be lost on my account. Now do not, dear, good Gusset, be offended at
                me for having kept you from your business so long--and when you get home, Gusset
                dear, let sister Winkle know that I have Walter and Lucy in charge, and that I will
                be with her to-night, and shall have a rubber at whist.' That's the way she ran on!
                Just as if she didn't know I had long since closed my shop! and before I could reply
                to her she pushed me out of the room with an attempt to kiss my cheek!" ( Ha! ha!
                ha!" "You may laugh, for it was fancied. And here is a print of her rouge on my
                ribbon, and you can see the wrinkles in it, as plainly as you can see the dirt on
                the frog-catcher's face!" "Who is the frog-catcher?" "Why the march-boy, as they
                call him, who lives in the ditches on Mr. Napoleon Winkle's estate. He hunts terra-
                pins, mushrooms, and such things for the emperor and Ser- geant Blore. Have you
                never seen Bill Dizzle?" "Oh, yes, and I pity him." e He's the happiest person I
                know. There they are!" cried Gusset, rising, as Dew was heard to bark furiously in
                the hall. "Sit still, Gusset," said Mrs. Winkle, "Biddy will open the door." A few
                moments after, Biddy entered softly. "Who is it?" asked her mistressa "Dill Bizzle,
                ma'm." "Dill Bizzle?" BILL DIZZLE. 9 "She means Bill Dizzle," said Gusset. "You know
                Biddy always blunders in her speech. But I felt sure it was Miss Wilsome and Lucy."
                "Biddy, tell him to come in;" said Mrs. Winkle. "Yes, ma'm," replied Biddy,
                withdrawing into the hall, where the boy was in waiting. Immediately after the maid
                uttered a loud cry, and ran into the room screaming fight inlly. Havingflungthe door
                wide open, Bill Dizzle appeared in view. e wore an old cap, its original color
                obliterated, and the material of which i; had been constructed, unknown. His carroty
                hair hung in long locks down his neck, behind and over his ears. His thin face, as
                usual, was bespeckled with the mud of the marshes. His forehead was low, his eyes
                small, gray and twinkling; his nose short and broad; his mouth wide, and his lips
                sufficiently pated to exhibit a most formidable array of teeth. He wore a yellow
                homespun sack, girdled round with a black leather belt. His pantaloons and. boots
                were, of course, of the color of the last ditch he had plunged into. "What have you
                there?" demanded Mrs. Winkle. smil- ing encouragingly, and gazing at a rod in the
                boy's hand, upon which was strung a row of what might have been taken for the hind
                quarters of squirrels, nicely prepared for the kitchen. 'Are they a present from my
                brother, or Sergeant Blore " The boy replied by an affirmative nod, and a smile.
                "Are they squirrels " The boy shook his head, but continued to smile. Oh, la!" cried
                Biddy, finding the power of utterance gain, which had been suspended, "s Missus!

                leave them with the cook." a Bill nodded and started away, but paused suddenly, and

                CHAPTER II. THE GAME BEGUN. THE CAT OUT OF THE BAG. THE arrival of Miss Wilsome and
                Lucy produced a gene- ral commotion throughout the establishment. They were ac-
                companied by Mr. Jonathan Dowly, an old bachelor, who had been one among the
                numerous ompetitors for the hand of Miss Edith Blount, some thirty-five years before
                the date of Miss Edith Blount..,-- : Sumittiug in silence to the events recorded in
                this history. Submitting the victory of his rival (the late Mr. Winkle), he had
                aban- doned the city, and lived ever afterwards in seclusion and solitude near the
                village of Babbleton, contenting himself with dreamy visions of his first and only
                love. He was never known to smile except when in the company of Mrs. Winkle, or some
                member of the family. Lucy was a perfect dupli- cate, in mercantile parlance, of
                what her mother had been whe young; and Mr. Dowly, happening to be returning from
                heiyn the same boat, and seeing the aunt and niece un- accompanied by a protector,
                had ventured timidly to make a tender of his services, which had a ready acceptance
                on the part of Lucy- THE GAME BEGUN. " "Stop, Gusset-don't go yet, that's a good
                creature," said Miss Wilsome, forcing the retired milliner back into her chair. "I
                made some shameful blunders to-day. Lucy has been telling me. You must forgive it; I
                had forgotten that you were no longer in business. It would have been so pleasant to
                have had you at dinner with us-for-we had no company-- and your conversation on the
                wearisome boat would have been a great relief. I hope you are quite comfortable,
                now." "I thank you, Miss Wilsome, and your munificent family, for the little
                independence I enjoy. My wants are few, and expenses light. I ought to be satisfied
                with the moderate means I possess. I am an humble body, and must never for- get what
                I once was. I amz not worthy of having any apolo- gies bestowed on me-but since you
                have so condescended, I am thankful." "Good Gusset-that's a kind creature! Now stay
                to tea, and afterwards we'll have whist. I'm so glad you have no girls to watch over
                at home. Sister, invite Gusset to stay to tea." "Certainly, she will oblige us,"
                responded Mrs. Winkle, who had been insisting upon Mr. Dowly's remaining likewise.
                "But Wilsome, what have you done with Walter, and Vir- ginia Oakland, and Mr.
                Roland? "Oh, I made Walter stay to take care of my house. The burglars are breaking
                in somewhere every night. The maids get too ungovernable if left to themselves--" "I
                hope you don't suppose Walter can keep them in or- der?" "He can tell me if they
                misbehave." He can if he will." "Will! my will governs in my house. But the
                principal reason why I left him in charge of my establishment, is that I want him to
                keep my coach in motion every day until the horses are thoroughly tamed. My
                housemaid, my coachman, and my horses are all spoilt by indulgence in idle habits.
                Do you know I have not rode in my own coach for a month? The last time I was out, I
                thought the horses were going. to mount up in the air, like the mythological teams
                we read of at school. They pranced and reared so outrageously, that I had to call a
                policeman. My man Snapper could not control them. Walter seemed delighted with the

                sent him to Coventry. Of course, Gusset has told you how that was." "I hope,
                Wilsome, Walter will be wise enough to take care of himself," remarked Mrs. Winkle,
                gravely. "I gave him particular instructions, and of course he will regulate his
                habits accordingly. Has your old beau consented to stay to tea? But no matter; he
                never could play. Yet, he is as silent as a sarcophagus. He didn't speak a dozen
                words on the boat-but just laughed with his eyes at Lifcy. There was, however, a
                very gentlemanly somebody smitten with us. I have seen him at Madame R.'s, but don't
                know him. He shifted his position continually, but never got a front view of me. I
                wonder why the men are never con- tented with. the aspect presented them! But here's
                the tea. Lucy must wait on her ancient beau. I have not heard his voice to-night."
                And Lucy did so very assiduously. She spread the snowy napkin on Mr. Dowly's lap,
                and held the sugar-dish for him, while he helped himself in silence. Mr. Dowly was
                past sixty and quite gray. His form was tall, slight, and quite erect for one of his
                age. His face was very pale, and the texture of the skin almost as delicate as a
                lady's. His eyes were large, very dark and expressive; but beneath them were huge,
                wrinkled cavities. His mouth generally protruded into a wo- begone, melancholy
                expression. But his nose was large and finely shaped, redeeming many of the traces
                of time and sorrow on his manly countenance. His dress was remarkable: he wore
                sometimes a blue coat, made thirty years before, and sometimes a brown one,
                fabricated fifteen years after the blue one, and both seemed to be as bright and
                free from the evi- dences of dilapidation as when they issued from the hands of the
                tailor. His hat, too, although shining in aspect, belonged to a former generation;
                and, in accordance with the good old fashion, his neckerchief was of a snowy
                whiteness. Poor old Mr. Dowly had 'deeply loved Miss Blount, and never sought the
                smiles of any other. He had been rejected for Mr. Winkle; but it produced no other
                sensation in his breast than that of melancholy regret. He had never ceased to gaze
                with pleasure on Mrs. Winkle, and, as we have said, never smiled except when in the
                presence of some member of her family. In his dreams he was always young again, and
                Miss Blouns MR DOWLY. 13 unmarried. By day he lived in the past; scenes and senti.
                ments of former years filled his reveries. He had always been in the habit of
                occasionally visiting the family, but was ever a silent guest, unless compelled to
                respond to the friendly words addressed him. He had not been a more frequent visitor
                in the days of Mrs. Winkle's widowhood than during the lifetime of her husband. It
                was too late in life to renew his addresses, and he preferred his accustomed
                contemplations of the past to any of the realities of life which might now be
                presented to him. He lived on a small farm, a short distance from town, employing a
                careful Welsh housekeeper and an industrious gardener, her son. His circumstances
                had been good; but no one now knew any thing of his fortune. Most people believed
                him to be poor, simply because they never knew him to incur any expense that might
                be avoided. What- ever investments he had were in the city, and of course they were
                past finding out, since he never spoke of his affairs to his neighbors. Lucy being
                called away by her aunt, who waa arranging the preliminaries for the rubber at
                whist, Mrs..Winkle occupied the seat vacated by her daughter, and seemed inclined to
                engage her old beau in a conversation. The old gentleman's large dark eyes were
                immediately illuminated. Here, we sit together again, Mr. Dowly, just ask we did
                thirty years ago. It seems to me very wonderful that at the completion of three
                decades, after the many storms of 'the world, and all the vicissitudes of life, you
                and I, and a few others should be left together upon the shore of time, while so
                many we knew, younger than ourselves, and apparently with stronger constitutions,
                have vanished from the scene for ever;' Mr. Dowly made no reply, but assented by the
                liquid elo- quence of his eyes, and a shrug of his shoulders. I strive to be
                cheerful, Mr. Dowly," resumed the widow, and find it more pleasant to laugh than to
                repine. I see in my daughter a counterpart of myself, when at her age -" She's
                beautiful-lovely-good," said Mr. Dowly. Ha! ha! ha! Precisely what you said of me,
                some thirty years ago! And believe me it is as gratifying to hear it now as it was
                then. You never reproachedme for the preference I gave Mr. Winkle." ?nT .pA o <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6922-00000013"/> "

                was my friend, and I his." "And I should be sorry to think you have been unhappy. I
                wonder you did not marry." "No; I have been very happy. I live in the past. My
                thoughts by day-my dreams by night; and so it shall be to the end. I am glad I never
                married. I never will marry. But you will let me be your friend. That is all I ask."
                "Most certainly." "And Lucy; she may want a friend." "How?- Oh; you mean my lamented
                husband died a bankrupt. But have we not friends? There's sister Wilsome and my
                brother-in-law-both unmarried like yourself, and the last worth a million, and as
                generous as the prince he supposes himself to be, in his fits of strange
                hallucination." "I hope they may be always mindful of their duty. I have no
                relations. This property, I believe, is all your hus- band left." "All. JIa! ha! ha!
                Small as it seems, the few acres attached are made to yield me a large revenue, I
                assure you, by the industry of good old Dibble and his son David, the gardeners."
                "You are fortunate in the Dibbles. But is not the place encumbered by a mortgage?"
                "I believe so; but my brother Napoleon attends to the interest. I really don't know
                who holds the mortgage." "I do; but no matter. Only this-if you should ever have a
                serious necessity for the use of funds, which your family may be slow in offering,
                don't forget John Dowly. Nobody knows any thing in relation to that old man's
                pecuniary means, and no one has any right to know-but you. Don't forget him."
                "Forget you! How can that be possiblel For the last twenty years not a week has gone
                by, that some little present has not come to our house to remind us of the existence
                and uniform kindness of good John Dowly. The only difficulty is, how to repay with
                gratitude the munificence of our generous friend." "Forget that! forget that! I am

                young. I am merry. Good night." And the old man departed, his large brilliant eyes
                glistening the more from the slight humidity that per- vaded them. "How shall we
                contrive it?" asked Wilsome, seated in a rocking chair near the table, and
                addressing Lucy in relation to the proposed game. "Let me see," responded Lucy,
                archly. "Ma, you know, has an aversion to the grave silence imposed on the players.
                You have often said she was too merry for whist. Gusset plays very well; but should
                there not be a man among us?" "There should be. I forgot that when I made Walter
                stay in town. But who would have supposed there was. not a single man to be had in
                all Babbleton?" "There are an abundance of single men here," said Mrs. Winkle,
                smiling. "Deuce take the bachelors! I mean a single gentleman, married or unmarried,
                for one's partner at whist. I can't play with a lady partner. Why, Lucy, have you no
                beaux? Don't blush so, child! 'Really, you begin to look like a woman. Behold her,
                sister; she is taller than you, and yours was a good height. See her broad
                shoulders, her almost Juno neck, her full rounded bust, her ivory forehead, her
                cloud of dark chestnut hair, her beautifully flushing cheeks, the white and red
                contending for the mastery t I never noticed her before. She is a lovely creature!"
                "Aunt Wilsome!" responded Lucy, laughing heartily. "What should I do if I were to
                hear some gentleman utter such a speech?" "Do? Why, if he were one approved by your
                family- which, never forget, is a good one-you might recline your head on his
                shoulder, and surrender your heart. But never be precipitate; ten years hence will
                be time enough. You see am in no hurry. Still, I think you are old enough, and
                handsome enough to have beaux. At least some -visitor capable of playing whist as my
                partner. ' Is there no such one?" "There is a gentleman living in the white cottage
                oppo-. site, who sometimes visits Walter, and who remarked last evening that the
                game was a sensible one." "He's a sensible man. Who is he, Gusset?" "A mysteribus

                but Mr. Walter, and he goes nowhere, except occasionally, to return Walter's visits.
                But he is handsome, and only about twenty-five. He is tall, pale, and sometimes very
                sad." "What is he doing here? Has he no profession, no businesss?" "It seems not. He
                has taken the cottage, and brought some furniture and a great many books from New
                York." Does he live alone?" "He has an old housekeeper, he brought with him-and she
                is English, for she says ouse instead of house, and hair instead of air." "How does
                he dress? What sort of feet and hands?" His clothes are very genteel-but not
                foppish. His feet and hands are small and handsome, the latter very white-" "So! He
                is either a gentleman, or a black-leg, or forger, or fugitive, or something of the
                sort. What do you think, Lucy? 2 "I kuow him to be a gentleman, aunt-and an educated
                gentleman, who has been accustomed to the best society. He has read every great
                author, and is very agreeable in conver- sation. He is a musician too, and sings
                delightfully." "Oh, I see you like him. I don't think he can be one of the opera
                troupe. What's his name?" "Lowe-Edmund Lowe," said Gusset. "But surely he won't play
                cards with us-----" "Why?" demanded Miss Wilsome, abruptly. "Because, one Sunday,
                when the rector's wife was taken suddenly ill, and her husband was sent for, Mr.
                Lowe, stranger as he was, stepped forward and offered to read the service. Surely he
                won't play cards!" "That don't follow. But did he read?" He did indeed," said Mrs.
                Winkle, " and I never heard the prayers better read in my life." "That will do. Send
                for Mr. Lowe to be my partner." Lucy whispered to Biddy, the message she wished to
                be delivered. A few minutes after, Mr. Lowe was ushered in, and introduced with due
                formality to the old maid, whose partner he became without the slightest hesitation.
                "I'm afraid you will repent of your complaisance," said Lucy to Mr. Lowe, who sat at
                her elbow while her aunt shuffled the cards. ' My aunt plays very patently " A
                SALUTE. 17 "Of course I do," said Miss Wilsom'e; "the game loses its interest when
                neglected." "I am very fond of the game, and have been called a good player,"
                replied, Mr. Lowe. "I'm glad to hear you say so," said Miss Wilsome, secretly
                planning to employ as much of his time as possible during her stay at Babbleton. "My
                aunt sometimes indulges in long sittings," pursued Lucy, with an arch glance at the
                composed features of the gentleman. "I frequently retire at three in the morning,
                and rise at eleven," was the imperturbable reply. "You are the very partner I want!"
                cried Miss Wilsome. "Fortunate sister," said Mrs. Winkle, laughing; ".but you must
                have pity on Lucy. If she remains awake too long after the usual hour of going to
                rest, she will have shocking eyes the next day." "There is too much brilliant fire
                sparkling in them now," said Miss Wilsome, "to be immed so easily." "I declare, Mr.
                Lowe," said Lucy, "my aunt has done nothing but compliment me ever since this game
                was proposed." "Pay attention to your cards, Lucy, and assort 'them be- fore you
                begin. It is Mr. Lowe's lead," said Miss Wilsome. "How could she do otherwise?" was
                Mr. Lowe's calm response, whilst leading a trump. "That's the knave, I believe,"
                said Miss Wilsome, staring at the card. Her vision was impaired by age, but it was
                ob- served that she never used her glasses when unmarried gentlemen played with her.
                "Sir, you do me honor," she continued, with her lips contracted into a simper. "But
                it's my trick!" said Gusset, triumphantly, playing the ace. Before the first game
                was ended, a tremendous explosion was heard in the distance, and was followed
                quickly by a suc- cession of startling reports. "Bless my life! What's that?" cried
                Miss Wilsome springing up from her chair, and running to a window. "See that flash!
                Just listen f" she continued. "It is a salute, said Mr. Lowe, joining Miss Wilsome.

                responded Miss Wilsome, angrily, and returning to the table. "Take up your cards. It
                is only my crazy brother. He should be confined in a madhouse when those fits are on
                him." Your brother?" asked Mr. Lowe. "Yes, sir. Is it possible he has been quiet
                since you have been residing here, so that you have not heard all about him? Yes, it
                is my brother Napoleon Winkle. He is a mono- maniac on the subject of Bonaparte's
                campaigns-in other matters he is rational enough." "He is an amiable, generous,
                noble-minded man," said Gusset, with emphasis, though timidly. "Why, Gusset, what do
                you know about-him?" asked Miss Wilsome, fixing her large searching eyes upon the
                re- tired milliner, and then, seeing Mr. Lowe evinced some in- terest in the
                subject, she continued: My brother, although really eighteen months youngerthan
                myself, and still a' bachelor, is proprietor of one of the largest estates in the
                county, which was mostly inherited from our father, who di- vided his fortune
                equally between his three children. Na- poleon, preferring land- to money, holds the
                old homestead plantation, which he has most singularly divided and subdi- vided into
                tracts after the plan of the map of Europe. Every state of Europe, whether empire,
                kingdom,' principality or duchy, may be found on his farm. Of course he resides in
                France. He reads nothing that does: not glorify his great model; and so fascinated
                has he become with the bloody career of that detestable butcher, that he sometimes
                fancies that the spirit of the conquering demon has been transmitted to him, and
                animates his corpulent body . He has been told that he resembles Bonaparte-and he
                really does look like the prints of him-and of course that:fact exercises a powerful
                in- fluence over his imagination. He has likewise picked up somewhere an old
                sergeant-one legged, one armed, and one eyed-who served under the Emperor, believes
                he was a God, and that his soul has taken up its abode in the breast of my poor
                brother. They have a perfect identity of ideas and feelings; and so they have

                victories. That is the solution of this startling rumpus to-night. I dare say my
                sister Winkle there, who is turning over the leaves of Alison's history, will soon
                be able to tell us what battle occurred on this day of the month. The magistrates of
                the county ought to put a stop to such a ridiculous nuisance, for the whole country
                is often startled and shocked at an unexpected moment by such Quixotic operations."
                "All the justices in the state would not venture to attack the good man," said
                Gusset. "Gusset, you are the only one I ever saw who was willing to defend my
                brother-and truly he does not need any one to defend him. No doubt if the officers
                were to approach his premises for the avowed purpose of suppressing his amuse-
                ments, he would conceive them to be invaders from some hostile country, and would
                send bombs and grape-shot in their midst. He has eight or ten old cannons, large and
                small, and a mortar or two. In one of his engagements he had a horse killed under
                him " "You mean an imaginary horse, Miss Winkle?" re- marked Mr. Lowe. "No indeed!
                He was fighting over the battle of Lodi- forgetting, I believe, that the first
                Napoleon was then on foot -when one of the old pieces, which Sergeant Blore was
                firing with a slow match-himself out of danger-burst into a thousand pieces. The
                horse was torn to atoms, while the rider remained unhurt. Then the sergeant embraced
                his master, and called him the ' Little Corporal!'" "Never have I heard of the
                actual existence of so singular a character," said Mr. Lowe. "It reminds me of
                Sterne's fictitious Uncle Toby and Corporal Trim." "Yes. And often have I told my
                brother that he was a plagiarist; but he assured me upon his honor that he had never
                read a word of Sterne, and it cannot be denied that he is a man of strict veracity
                and honor. But he banished me from his territories for even suggesting such a thing.
                He called me a meddling Madame de Stael, and told me, most imperiously, to go and

                Austrians was not complete until after nightfall. Poor uncle Toby!" "I do not think,
                Ma," said Lucy, "that uncle Winkle copies Sterne's hero. He does not fight with
                jack-boots, and there is no widow in the case." "No, truly," said Gusset. "And I've
                often heard Mr. Winkle say no widow could ever carry his heart." "And you remember
                the saying?" interrogated Miss Wil- some, darting a glance at the milliner. "My
                brother, I suppose, has no notion of marrying at all, at least not im- mediately."
                "No, aunt," said Lucy. "He has often said he would wait until after the 4lebration
                of your nuptials." "And, mypretty niece, that may occur sooner than you suppose. But
                if it should not, pray don't let it be a re- straint upon you." "Oh, mercy, aunt!"
                "Then don't meddle with sharp instruments. What amuses my partner? He is almost
                convulsed. Pay attention, sir! Gusset would not have won that 'trick,' as she calls
                it, but for your inattention. Being third in play, you should have secured it." "But
                I have the honors, and we win the game. I was thinking of an incident I witnessed
                during the battle of Buena Vista, which our resumption of the game brought to mind."
                "Were you in thatlbattlf?" asked Lucy. "Oh yes. Merely as a spectator. I have been a
                wanderer "The incident-the incident," said Miss Wilsome, deal- ing the cards. "The
                mounted regiment from Kentucky, as you must be aware---" began Mr. Lowe. "No, I did
                not read a word of the war, because I was opposed to it." "The Kentuckians were
                ordered to maintain a certain position. After every charge they returned to the
                ground specified. That their horses might continue in wind, the riders, after every
                attack, dismounted, and choosing partners, sat down and played cards on the ground.
                And I noticed that whenever the order came for them to mount and charge the hostile
                lancers, each one put down his cards, the trumps carefully concealed at the bottom.
                And when they returned TOM, OR HS GHOST. 21 if the amusement had not been
                forestalled by the loss of a partner-and I believe one in every five of the regiment
                fell -the game was resumed with a nonchalance equal to our own after the cannonading
                we heard just now." "Well, Biddy? well? What do you want?" asked Mrs. Winkle, seeing
                her maid open the door leading into the hall, and standing in a hesitating attitude.
                "It's Dill Bizzle, main." "Bill Dizzle, she means," said Lucy, smiling at the habit-
                ual blunder of Biddy. "What does he bring, now? Mushrooms or terrapins '" "It's in a
                bag, mam-and he sis it's for Miss Milsop." Wilsome-you stupid dunce!" cried Miss
                Winkle, her temples as red as her cheeks. "Remember that, Biddy. It is the second
                time you have made that blunder. Let it be the last." "Ye-s mam." "I don't like to
                be called man, either. But what has the boy brought me 1 Tell him to come here with
                it. With your permission, Mr. Lowe." Mr. Lowe bowed his assent. Dizzle was ushered
                in with a bag on his arm. In vain it was conjectured what its contents might be.
                Lucy retired to the furthest corner of the room, and her mother did not ap- proach
                nearer to the messenger or his mysterious burden. "What in the world is it "
                demanded Miss Wilsome, in a loud voice. "I'll show him," said Dizzle, with his
                invariable smile, striving for some length of time ineffectually to dislodge the
                object from the sack. "Mercy on us! It moves Is it alive?" cried Lucy. "In course
                he's alive," said Dizzle, violently jerking up the closed end of the sacks and
                forcibly extricating the animal. It was a beautiful white cat. And it stood quite
                motion- less in their midst, and during the breathless silence that ensued, gazed
                round in utter bewilderment at the strange faces. It then uttered a piteous cry, and
                walked slowly to- wards Miss Wilsome, who sprang upon it with spasmodic delight and
                hugged it in her arms. "It's my poor Tom, or his ghost!" cried she. ' He's one of
                the family, and jest as good as the old Tom," said Dizzle. <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6922-00000017"/> 22 THE WINKLES, "Poor
                puss!" continued Miss Wilsome, delighted to see the pet appreciating her caresses,
                "where in the world did it come from? Excuse me, Mr. Lowe, but I had a cat I loved
                so much-he died-or was cruelly murdered by a dog named Roland-and this is a perfect
                picture of him. Who sent it to me, Dizzle? Here's a dollar for you." "He told me,
                before I told you, you must tell me " "I must tell you?" "If it was going to make
                you mad." "Mad? Why no! If-if-if it is only another-like the one I had," continued
                Miss Wilsome, gazing affectionately at the humming and purring creature-"I mean if
                it should be another--" "Don't you see it's another?" responded Dizzle. "Jest as
                much like your old Tom as two peas-not a black hair on him-and not a bit wicious! "I
                mean, Dizzle, if it has the same name-and the same disposition-and----" "His name's
                Tom, arid in course-- Mr. Roland said you'd as soon have a nanny goat about your
                house as a biddy cat. He's a innocent fellow, too, Iknow." "You think he never
                murdered a mouse?" asked Mr. Lowe, which was succeeded by half suppressed explosions
                of laughter from Lucy and her mother. "Dizzle!" continued Miss Wilsome, "if Mr.
                Roland sent me this pet, tell him he has made amends for his unlucky act -and that I
                forgive him. Go now, Dizzle. Mr. Lowe, please excuse me for desiring to postpone the
                game until to- morrow. You can have no conception of the deep interest I take in the
                poor dumb domestic animals which are generally so cruelly treated. I am aware of the
                censure I incur; but I defy the scandal of idle tongues. Good-by, Gusset. But
                whatever affords us any degree of happiness, however insigni- ficant the object
                which produces it may appear, should not be despised." Mr. Lowe assented readily to
                the proposition, remarking that one of his aunts had been so fond of a poodle as to
                carry it always in her carriage, and she made it a rule to kiss the dear little
                creature every night before retiring to rest. He then took his leave; and Miss
                Wilsome, giving full vent to her long pent up affection, almost distracted poor Tom
                with her infinite fund of endearments. ON A LARK. .23 CHAPTER III. ON A
                LARK-WALTER-THE STUDENT-THE POET. "EFT soleamaster of his aunt's establishment in
                the city, young Winkle resolved, as most young gentlemen of his age and dis.
                position would have done, to make the most of his opportunity, and reap the greatest
                possible amount of enjoyment from the means and time placed at his disposal.
                Therefore, no sooner had his aunt and sister departed for the boat, than he tossed
                the book he had been reading-"The Mirror of Moral Pro- priety," written for the
                edification of credulous dupes-to the farthest extremity of the parlor, and leaning
                back, rang the bell very violently. "Tell Snapper to have the carriage at the door
                as soon as possible," was the young man's order to the housemaid, who gazed with
                eager curiosity. "Iss, sir." "And when you have done that, Rose, come Aback- to me.
                I shall want you." "Iss, sir," responded the maid, springing away to do the young
                man's bidding. Then Walter promenaded the magnificent saloon, with a proud step and
                a sounding heel. His hands were thrust into his pockets behind, and his eyes,
                disregarding the statuary and fine paintings surrounding him, were fixed upon the
                ceiling. "If I could only meet with one of the fellows, now 1" said he, "what a time
                we would have! If I thought my aunt would stay away several days-but she never knows
                herself- I could write to Princeton, or to New York, and get one or two-- "Iss,
                sir," said Rose, standing before him at one of his turns, and dropping a slight
                courtesy. - "Oh, you told him, did you?" "Iss, sir." 'All right, Rose. Rose, I
                suppose my aunt told you all that I was left master of the house!" "Is sir." <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6922-00000018"/> 24
                - THE WINKLES. "And of course every one will do whatever I desire?" "Oh iss, sir."
                "Then tell the cook I may have company to a late supper; and if I do, I shall want
                at least five hundred oysters roasted in the shell. Is there any champagne in the
                cellar?" "Iss, sir." "See that the cobwebs are brushed off some half-a-dozen of the
                bottles." "Iss, sir." "I suppose my aunt don't smoke cigars?" "Iss-Oh la, no, sir."
                "Then I'll buy some. She gave me her purse. Let the bill for the oysters-and a brace
                of woodcock-be presented in the morning- .... "It can't be done, for it's
                onreasonable!" said the great fat colored cook, who had been listening in the hall,
                and now came boldly forward, as matters pertaining to her jurisdiction were
                discussed. "Why, Griddle? Pray, why is it unreasonable?" "Why? Why who ever heard of
                oysters at this sea- son " A "True-I didn't think of that." "There's none but milky
                ones-and the cholera's bad enough without helping it any." "True, Griddle. You are a
                philosopher. But what is there nice for me to invite a friend to, if I should meet
                with one?" "Plenty. I can get woodcock, and if you can afford it- for Miss Wilsome
                wouldn't-I can get fresh salmon- " "That's it. Get a dollar or so's worth. I hear
                the bell -see who it is, Rose. [Exit Rose.] Now, my good Griddle, I may rely on
                you?" "That you may! Say nothing more about it. It does my heart good to see young
                people enjoy demselves in reason, if they behave demselves. And I saw old Snapper's
                eyes blinking, and his teeth grinning, as he went to the stable. It does our old
                hearts good to get a sight of the young gentry once in a while." "Iss-it's the
                coach, sir." "Is it down fore and aft? Stop, I can see through the blinds. Yes,
                all's right." "Snapper'll do right 1" said Griddle. He'll have every A FAIR START.
                25 thing open and displayed in grand style. And he's got on his new coat with the
                silver buttons." "Iss, and his new hat, with the broad silver lace band." "I can't
                tell when I'll be back," said the young gentleman, pulling on his kid gloves. "But
                have the supper and the champagne ready when they are called for." He then strode
                through the hall, and descended the flight of marble steps in front with the
                elasticity of buoyant youth enfranchised from every species of restraint, and
                exulting in the possession, as he supposed, of the m'eans of commanding the most
                perfect happiness. No indivi dual in the street of decent exterior escaped his eyes
                as he mounted into the luxu- riantly cushioned carriage; and he was quite sure that
                no eye could withhold its admiring glance from his handsome person and brilliant
                equipage. Nevertheless Walter Winkle was not excessively vain, and he was now
                engaged in his first fit of ex- travagant folly, an indulgence mainly attributable
                to the re- action which sometimes follows a long imposed restraint, or is one of the
                incidents of healthful youth, and accompanying the exuberance of spirits so often
                inseparable from it. Snapper had now an opportunity of taking off the wiry edge of
                his high-mettled and almost ungovernable horses. His whip sounded startlingly over
                their astonished ears. Their nostrils were turned out, their eyes emitted luminous
                rays, and their bits were covered with foam, before the expiration of the first hour
                of their exercises. Walter, alone in the car- riage, reclining on the rear seat, had
                already traversed most of the fashionable thoroughfares, and had doubtless been
                stared at by thousands of dark flashing eyes, for the gay season at the
                watering-places had not yet commenced. "Snapper!" cried Walter, as they were
                returning slowly through Chestnut street, and when opposite the custom house -"
                follow that mian with the straw hat-the one with a blue coat and metal buttons. I
                think he's a friend of mine. Deuce take the omnibuses and drays-" "The drays are
                loaded with kags of silver and gold," re- plied Snapper. "And Uncle Sam's specie
                seems to be the only money in the country that passes too slowly. Can't you get
                round it some how I'm afraid we'll lose the blue coat and brass but- tons. I wish
                some of the Washington officials were here!" Snapper succeeded in extricating the
                horses from the 2 <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6922-00000019"/> 26 THE WINKLES. throng, 1y dint of hard whipping, a comnanding
                voice, and his silver lace and buttons, just in time to come up with the pedestrian
                when opposite the door of the American hotel. "George Parke! Huzza!" cried Walter.
                "How are you, old fellow," he continued, leaping down and seizing the hand of his
                friend, who was really younger than himself, al- though " old fellow " was
                repeatedly uttered by them both. "Whose carriage is that, Winkle?" asked Parke.
                Mine-mine for a day or two, at the very least. But where are you going?" "To the
                American, here. You know what that means. Out of money. Uncle Johnny at Princeton,
                you know, thinks differently. Have you seen any of the boys? Our class is off for
                the vacation. I don't go South this summer; but have written home for money. I have
                only a shilling left for cigars, and do't know how I am to get to the opera
                to-night, unless the landlord will lend me some cash. I'm glad the college is in
                good credit here." "Say no more!" cried Walter. "Let me fling your car- pethag in.
                Now jump up yourself. You shall be my guest. Aunty's away, and I am master of her
                establishment. Jupiter, Mars and Saturn But I am glad I met you! What would I have
                done there alone, or with only a Pack of .grinning ser- vants laughing at me, a
                noisy parrot, and a mischievous mon- key? We'll enjoy ourselves, Parke, and you
                shall be at no expense. Drive home, Snapper! Parke, old fellow, there is a beautiful
                girl in the city---" "A thousand, you mean." "No, I don't. But there is one, above
                all others, the queen of beauty-the, the Oakland." "Is she here?" "At her
                uncle's-Dr. Nitre's. I brought her down to- day. After rubbing up a little we'll go
                there and have her to ride with us." "Won't her aunt Nitre go along?" "I hope not.
                But if she does, you know Virginia's my prize. That rich snob, Ralph Roland, is
                still following her- but she says he's not the thing. And I flatter myself---" "But
                Winkle, you must let me have a fair start with yonl." "Parke! It may be well for us
                to understand each other, and then there can be no mistake. Virginia and I are--"
                UTTER CONFUSION. 27 "What?" "Engaged! Now you have it. We expect to wait a year or
                so-but the thing is understood between ourselves. That's all. Don't whisper it in
                your dreams. Now, you may flirt with her as much as you please, and I can rely upon
                your honor,. "Oh, yes-I understand. The old trick." "I assure you I am serious,
                George, though I cannot for the life of .me look grave. If it were not so, what
                objection think you could I have to your falling in love with her, and she with you?
                None, whatever, believe me. But you forget Julia Nitre! If the old lady should take
                it into her head to be one of the party, I don't suppose her daughter is to be left
                at home." "I've heard some accounts of Miss Julia; and if she be half as handsome as
                they report her, you may enjoy your real or pretended affianced to your heart's
                content. Is this your aunt's establishment? It is stately enough." They descended in
                front of Miss Wilsome Winkle's man- sion, and without delay -mounted to the third
                story. The apartments had been hastily prepared for the accommodation of Walter, but
                nevertheless, there were many evidences re- maining of the idiosyncrasy of the
                proprietor. Broken fur- niture, fractured china, and old slippers; the accumulation
                of some thirty years, were packed away under the beds and in the corners. Even dingy
                doll babies, probably arrived at the mature age of threescore and ten--for they had
                amused the little Wilsome some sixty years before-were visible in the closets. And
                on the mantel-piece, preserved in a glass case, was an antique silver pin-cushion,
                filled with pins blackened by the damps of departed generations, and duly labelled
                as the one used by Miss Winkle's mother, or grandmother, it is not recollected
                which, on her wedding-day. In another case, were the high-heeled wedding shoes. In
                short, Miss Wilsome was one of those remarkable characters who literally preserve
                every thing, and in emergencies can find nothing, because of the superabundance and
                confusion of their acquisitions. .And although she was quite as parsimonious and
                economical as might be consistent with the habits of life, yet she never knew the
                exact state of her finances. Having originally one hun- dred thousand dollars, in.
                money, the entire sum was invested in such securities as the cashier of the bank
                where the deposit <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6922-00000020"/> 28 THE WINKLES. had been. made, advised; and she never inquired
                further in relation to the safety of the investment, or in regard to the
                fluctuations of the stocks. The investment had been made when the stocks were fifty
                per cent. below par; and they had subsequently declined most alarmingly, without
                causing her a painful thought. But they were now fully at par; that is, worth double
                the sum she had paid-and yet she did not seem to be aware of the gain. The dividends
                were passed to her credit in the bank, and she drew upon them without number- ing
                her checks, or keeping any account of the balance subject to her order. She relied
                upon the annual publication of balances which the law required the banks to make, to
                ascer- tain in an indisputably authentic form, the exact statement of the amount of
                funds subject to her demand at stated periods. Such was her peculiar financial
                system; and the most acute banker would have failed in any attempt to convince her
                that her income might be materially increased by the adoption of any. other. "See
                here, Winkle!" said Parke, "are we not in the wrong chamber? This looks like a
                nursery, or a museum." It looks like aunt Wilsome's mind precisely--but I will see
                if any other room on this floor is in a better condition. No!" he continued,
                endeavoring to open other doors. "All locked. Just like her. She won't trust us in
                any other chamber than the one allotted to us. Some of them they say have not been
                entered for years by any one but herself. She creeps about alone with a candle in
                her hand at all hours of the night. So say the servants, who have watched her. But
                if you are ready, let us be off." "How does that look?" demanded Parke, adjusting

                bloods descended to the street, and were soon sitting in the coach in the attitude
                of unfeigned satisfaction. A few minutes afterwards the young gentlemen were enter-
                ing Mrs. Nitre's parlor. They found themselves rather ab- ruptly in the presence of
                the young ladies, and were joined a moment after by Mrs. Nitre and the merry-faced
                doctor. "We came to propose-- " said Walter, stammering and hesitating, after the
                ceremony of introducing his friend, and laboring under some degree of embarrassment,
                notwithstand- ing his predetermined impudence, or boldness; and as all eyes were now
                turned upon him, and a silence prevailed, he found it impossible to proceed. "The
                deuce you do!" at length exclaimed the doctor, rising comically. "If that be- the
                case, Mrs. Nitre, should not you and I withdraw?" "Don't attempt to be witty,
                doctor," replied his wife; "no one is amused at you; all can see that you merely
                affect to be serious." "We came to propose," continued Walter, blushing in unison
                with the girls, "to the ladies---" and again he paused. "Of course, to the ladies,"
                said the doctor, "who else could it be to?" "To Mrs. Nitre, and-" pursued Walter,
                forgetting his previous resolution of omitting her name, but aware there would not
                be room for five in the carriage. "Oho " cried the doctor, " then it must be a
                proposal of some other nature." "If such a thing were possible, the doctor would not
                ob- ject to see me proposed for and taken away," said Mrs. Nitre, who was one of the
                few dames who habitually depreciate their husbands in the presence of their guests,

                they must neces- sarily degrade themselves by such practices. "I mean that we came
                to propose a drive in my aunt's car- riage, which is waiting at the door," said
                Walter, now quite recovered. "And to slight me-deliberately to cut me," said the
                doctor, apparently not heeding Mrs. N.'s allusion. "But my own carriage will be at
                the door in a few minutes. I have to call at the Girard to see some friends-the
                'Gaffs of New York -and Mrs. Nitre has agreed to accompany me.". "I believe I won't
                go," said Mrs. Nitre. "The Gaffs are not intimate acquaintances of mine. They made a
                fortune selling drugs by the dose, soda-water by the glass, tooth-brushes, co.

                the aristocratic order. "Then I need not delay. I will excuse you on the plea of
                company," said Dr. Nitre, rather gravely; "but I hope, my dear, that I may invite
                them to tea to-morrow, and that you will call on them this evening." And he departed
                without further delay. "No doubt the vacation is a carnival," said Miss Oaklandf who
                had engaged in a free conversation with young Parke, and was exerting her powers of
                fascination, for she was piqued at Walter for having, it might be unconsciously,
                surrendered a beautiful rose to Julia. O "It is indeed. And we endeavor to seize the

                placing her hand on the youth's arm, "you must first get into the senior class, my
                dear boy." "But the sun is sinking," said Walter, " and the carriage waits." "There
                is room for only four in the carriage," said Julia, looking out of the window. '
                That's awkward," said Mrs. Nitre. "I cannot trust the girls alone with such madcaps.

                with us to the opera, if we do?" asked Walter. "Not to-night." "Why not, mamma?"
                asked Julia. "I don't go to such places often. Our rector does not ap- prove of it.
                But it is probable the Gaffs may be there, and then my husband might be suspected of
                uttering or conniving at a falsehood." Mrs. Nitre, although she habitually strove to
                mortify the doctor when in his presence, was remarkably kind to him behind his back.
                "Then you will stay?" asked Julia. "I sup --" began Walter. "You recollect our
                positive engagement?" said George, quickly. 'Hem--yes! I came near forgetting it.
                I'm very sorry; but we cannot break the engagement," replied Walter, wonder- ing
                what sort of a story George would invent. "So you are engaged for other company, Mr.
                Parke?" asked Virginia. "Yes," said George, without hesitation, "Several fellows
                from Princeton are to meet us there. But if we can find them before the doors open,
                perhaps we might persuade them to come here.". "Do so," said Mrs. Nitre. "The girls
                will expect you." The young gentlemen departed, promising if possible to re- turn in
                the evening. "What fellows from Princeton did you mean, George?" asked Walter, as
                the carriage proceeded slowly towards the theatre, the horses being now quite jaded,
                and altogether tame enough. "Ourselves, of course. I thought we were to have a lark
                to-night." "Good And I was not well pleased with Virginia's con- duct. She had
                nothing to say to me." "Oh, you had no rose for her." "Julia snatched it. Ha! ha!

                us. Tell cook to have a glorious supper in readiness-- and take a bottle or so into
                the kitchen for yourselves." The young gentlemen soon grew weary of the opera. There
                was not a fashionable audience present; and although they might be able to translate

                had antici- pated. At the end of the first act they abandoned the place. "Back to
                Nitre's?" asked George. "No," said Walter; we're on a lark." "Where shall we go?"
                "Let me think." "To Abraham Laban's! What say you?" "The Jew pawnbroker's?" "Yes."
                "Why? I have plenty of money." "Why? For the fun of the thing. Great Nose knows me."
                "No doubt of it." "And perhaps he'll permit us to have a glance at his cus- tomers.

                this is his night for the three balls. Let us see how much we can raise on my
                watch." "No. Let me try my diamond pin. I can redeem it to- morrow. The less he
                advances, the less will be the cost of the fun." "Agreed. But let us appear to be in
                a d-1 of a fix- most distressingly in need of money. That will sharpen his cupidity,

                fifty dollars." "We'll see what he says of it. After business, if he drives a good
                bargain, he may be pleasant. Come on-it is near at hand, in the next back street."
                "You know the way?" "Yes. He once sold a flute of mine among his forfeited
                collaterals, and a friend bought it at a less sum than Great Nose had advanced me.

                the sig- nal and soon obtained admittance. "Ahl Is it you? I'm glad to see you, Mr.
                Parke, and your friend.. Come back into my private office," said Abra- ham, who was
                an American Israelite, leading the young gen- tlemen into a small, well lighted
                apartment, which he usually occupied himself, and whence he disputed with his
                customers through a square opening communicating with a stall in the front room.
                "Any customers in front?" asked Parke, after introducing Winkle as his friend,
                without naming him. "Not now. There may be, soon. Many of the fashiona- bles are
                making arrangements to spend a few weeks at the watering-places. I have had two
                curious applicants to-night whom you should have seen or heard. It would have been a
                lesson for you," "Tell us about them, Abraham." "Perhaps I will, after business.
                What have you brought me this time? Not the old flute, I hope. That was a smart
                trick. I won't advance so much next time. I was too liberal. What do you want now?"
                "Nothing "myself. I'm rich since I made that fortune out of you. My friend here
                wants your assistance." "I hope I shall have the pleasure of serving him. I will
                advance him any amount on his simple bond." ' That is liberal," said George; "you
                never made me any such generous offer." "Your parents live too far away. Besides, I
                did not know you had any rich bachelor uncles and maiden aunts." "Do you suppose I
                have any?" asked Walter. "Ha, ha, ha! You know me-every body knows the Jew, Abraham
                Laban; and why should not Abraham know every body? Tell me that, Mr. Walter Winkle."
                "I see no reason why he should not. You certainly know me. Well, I am in great
                distress for a little ready cash; and I fear to forfeit the good opinion of my rich
                relatives by apply- ing to them just at this particular time. Besides, my necessi-
                ty is most urgent, and will not admit of delay. It is to com- pound a little
                scandalous affair on my hands, which would ruin me if made known." "Aha! Pretty

                understand your motive." "Is it necessary you should?" asked Walter. No-not in
                matters of business; but merely for my own satisfaction. Every one knows my motive."
                "Yes. The balls declare it." "And somehow I find out the secrets of my customers, if
                they don't choose to reveal them themselves. I should not be surprised if you came
                here purely for amusement. Confess -and you shall be entertained." "Here's your

                mourning-for she was the widow-" "The widow!" "Yes, the widow; and she was very
                properly in mourning. But the veil was lifted for me. She confessed what I already
                knew very well, that her late husband died insolvent. And then she spoke of the
                great fortune of her wooer-the clergy- man-and said if she could only borrow from me
                the means of meeting the demands of creditors until the celebration of her nuptials,
                she would then be enabled to pay me mu- nificently." "Is this romance or reality?"
                asked Walter, gravely. "It is truth. I know the widow could not be deprived of her
                dower. Her husband possessed much real estate, although he died insolvent. I told
                her she would have sufficient fortune for a comfortable support, and advised her not
                to seek to avoid an exposure of her husband's affairs. I then told her all I knew of
                her lover, the nature of his application to me, and of his design upon her supposed
                large fortune." "What did she say to that?" asked Parke. "Not what you would
                suppose. Her heart had not been engaged in the matter at all. As a clear headed,
                cool, calcu- lating woman of the world, she merely laughed at his im- pudence and
                hypocrisy; lamented her own want of discern- ment; and then calmly renounced him for

                visitor." This visitor, when admitted by the girl who answered the bell, did not
                proceed at once to the stall of communication; but strode backwards and forwards
                under the small lamp that dimly illuminated the dreary room. And as he promenaded
                words were uttered in his soliloquy, not comprehended by the Jew. "He's talking
                Latin!" said Walter, in a low tone. "Greek too!" responded Parke. "Greek and Latin I
                Who can it be? Let's have a peep at him." They beheld a thin man of medium height,
                with a black frock coat buttoned up to the chin. His face was very pale, and
                classically handsome. His forehead, especially, was a noble one, fair, round, and
                expansive. His age might be five and thirty. At length he approached the
                pawnbroker's cell. "I want money," said he. "My name is Pollen. Per- haps you have
                heard it." "Yes, I have heard it-and so has every body, I suppose." "Is it good?"
                "Good? Yes, a very good one, as a poet. And it will be famous; for the British
                reviewers say you are a man of genius." "If it be good, then, how much is it good
                for?" "How much money? That's a different matter. I deal in dollars and cents, and
                tangible valuables. The commodi- ties of fame and genius, and all such fanciful
                things, may be esteemed by those who traffic in such articles, but I am not one of
                them. I want that which I can see, feel, taste, barter, exchange, for my money."

                as a generous benefactor?" "No What good would it do me when dead?" "If you did not
                survive to enjoy it, would it not be a credit to your despised tribe?" No. Rathera

                wearying them with their importunities, as you are now wearying me." "H Iave you no

                "Was it approved?" "Yes. But unfortunately I was something in arrears for former
                advances, and desired to obtain the cash for this poem. But they wanted it in
                fulfilment of an engagement. I promised others, but insisted on having the price of
                the present production, to answer my immediate necessities. They would not believe
                me, which is a provocative of delin- quency. But I will fulfil all my engagements.

                consideration, received in advance--" "Aha I Now you are the man of business. See
                now, if I was not right awhile ago." "Very right. What shall the dedication be
                worth? I must know beforehand. A friend once dedicated to a rich man, and did not
                receive, in return, so much as an acknowl- edgment of the compliment. Business men
                must be dealt with in a business-like manner. Men of great hearts in a noble manner.

                will give you five dollars for the poem." Good! I shall eat again, and then sleep."
                "The dedication .?" D-- the dedication. Your name shall not be associ- ated with
                mine." "Not on the same bond, truly. But mine would bring the most money." "The most
                filth-dust, dust, dust-what is money, but so much of the dross of the earth, whilst
                my coinage is inde- strutible!" "I will not give you five dollars for the poem."
                "Then pass it back." I'll give you ten!" cried Walter. "Are you there, young
                Truepenny? Come forth. You shall have it, and share a jovial bottle with me besides.
                Come forth." The young gentlemen joined him immediately, notwith- standing the
                attempts of the Jew to the contrary, and the three sallied forth together. The name
                of the poet, Harold Pollen, was familiar to the young men, and that of Winkle was
                not unknown to the poet, for he had once been an invited guest at Miss Wilsome's
                mansion, and had played whist with her. A few moments sufficed for introduction, and
                then it was agreed they should immediately proceed together to the "Winkle Mansion,"
                as it was called. \, NINE AT SUPPER. 39 CHAPTER IV. NINE AT
                SUPPER-STAR-GAZING-NOCTURNAL MSTAKES-SHOOT. ING STARS. WHEN the young gentlemen
                entered the "Winkle Mansion," they found a sumptuous repast awaiting them; and as
                the poet had fasted long, and intimated that he was annoyed by an intolerable
                thirst, not many words were spoken until several courses had vanished, and after the
                decapitation of the secdl bottle. "Winkle," at length said the poet, "you know of
                course who it is you are entertaining in this princely manner." "Certainly--the
                author of ' The Treasure,' ' The Steed of the Clouds," and ' The Rook,'-a Poet,
                who-- " "A vagabond!" "A genius!" said Parke. "A vagabond," repeated Pollen. "You
                seem to be minus the usual quantum of linen about the neck," said Walter;
                scrutinizing his guest. "Why is your coat buttoned up to your chin in such
                suffocatingly hot weather?" "Because I have neither vest nor shirt under it." "Is it
                possible?" cried the young men together, really shocked at such an announcement. "I
                could give you further demonstration by unbuttoning my coat. I suppose you have some
                linen in the house, and will clothe the poet whom you have so sumptuously feasted."
                Walter immediately conducted his guest to the chamber above, where he was speedily
                arrayed in a snowy nether gar- ment, and accommodated with a seasonable vest. "I did
                not say I was a vagabond," continued Pollen, on resuming his seat at the round'table
                in the dining-room, "because of the deficiency in my wardrobe, and for the piti- ful
                purpose of obtaining the- loan of a shirt; but because I write' tales and verses,
                and am poor-because I forfeited an estate by refusing to flatter a woman I
                dislike--because I won't cheat and steal-- '"That's a strange reason," interrupted
                Parke. "It is a strange world. Let me whisper a secret in your <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6922-00000026"/> 40
                THE WINKLES. ear-and mind, you are not to betray your author. Will you both promise,
                upon your honor, not to betray me " "Both. Upon honor." "Then listen " said the
                poet, in a hoarse whisper, while his face assumed a paler hue than usual: "All very
                rich men, who have made their own fortunes, are rogues and rascals." "I have heard
                that before," said Walter; "but I cannot believe it." "No doubt some of my friends
                have whispered it about the world" said Pollen. "It is true, though, and you may
                lieve it. But I have another secret, which I am sure you have never heard. The
                vagabond is quite as happy as the rich man. The proof? I am the vagabond, and the
                hunch- nosed Jew is the rich man. Well, suppose Abraham sleeps some eight hours in
                the twenty-four. His dreams are filled with conflagrations, bankruptcies, robberies;
                visions of the broken-hearted widows and orphans he has despoiled; arrests for
                crimes long forgotten by all but himself; prisons and compulsory restitutions. Then
                we may estimate some four hours of the day devoted to fearful anticipations, to
                threats of enemies, reproaches of his victims, and dread of detection. Thus half of
                his life is miserable." "Now, yours?" said Walter. "My dreams-when sober-are
                blissful. I am the pos- sessor of illimitable wealth, without a pang of remorse, for
                no one has been viktimized in the process of its acquisition. With boundless
                generosity, I enjoy the luxury of bestowing benefits on the deserving and needy. The
                oppressor scowls, the usurer gnashes his teeth at me; but the good and the hunible
                bless my name. What felicity 1 I mount into an em- pyreal atmosphere-become
                dephlogisticated-- "And metaphysical," said Walter. "But we are in this mundane
                region now, Pollen, with tangible objects before us." "' Very true, and I will
                descend to them. But you must admit I have demonstrated that without a dime in my
                pocket -I lie, I have an eagle-I may enjoy more hours of happi- ness than the rich
                Abraham." "When you are quite sober," said Parke, sipping his wine, "and in your
                dreams." .. . "Keep sober!" cried a voice, from the portico in the yard. THE
                MONKEY'S LAST BITE. 41 "Who said that?" cried Parke, stepping to the open win- dow
                and looking out among the vines, where all was silent now, and lonely in the
                moonlight. "A mere echo," said the poet, when the young man re- sumed his seat. "It
                sounded very much like my aunt's voice," said Wal- ter. "If she were to come upon
                us, we should be given into the custody of the watchman." "Trumps! Down with your
                trumps!" said the voice. "My aunt! Let us escape!" said Walter, leaping up. "Sit
                still. Be calm," said the poet. "It is not her voice. I believe in the existence of
                ghosts." "Feathered ones', said Parke, standing again at the open window. "The
                parrot!" exclaimed Walter, resuming his seat. "An imitator. He merely echoes the
                sounds he hears. Hence the resemblance of your aunt's voice. They call me an
                imitator of Coleridge and others, but----" "No metaphysics," said Parke. "The d 1,"
                exclaimed Pollen, rising abruptly. "What's the matter, now?" demanded Walter. "I'm
                bitten. A mad dog! See-my finger is bleeding." "I hear the rattling of a chain under
                the table," said Parke. "I thought I saw something glide in from yonder door as I
                returned from the window." "Sit still!" said Walter. "Move not a muscle; a mos-
                quito could not have produced such a wound." "Nor a cobra, di capello," said Pollen.
                "It is biting my toe!" said Parker, turning pale, and kicking the assailing object
                violently with his heel. They sprang up in great alarm, and discovered, in amaze-
                ment, Miss Wilsome's great monkey in the last convulsive struggles of death. Parke
                had broken its neck. "Monkeys and parrots!" said Pollen; " abominations to man--fit
                companions for old maids." "My aunt' will lament over Jocko as she would over a
                brother. Mr. Roland accidentally killed her cat, and she has never forgiven him. How
                shall I avoid her anger? She'll disinherit me." "Leave it to me," said Pollen,
                dragging forth the dead animal by its chain, which was of silver. "I hope all the
                ser- vants are asleep." <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6922-00000027"/> 42 THE WINKLES. "Are you asleep, Biddy?" asked Walter,
                turning towards the door leading into the kitchen. "Iss, sir," was the prompt
                response of the watching girl. "I understand her," said Walter, seeing the
                astonishment of his companions. "She means that we need not fear her." ' Then lead
                the way to the roof of the portico," said the poet, " and get me a nail and hammer.
                I will suspend him from the eaves, and it will be a case of accidental strangula-
                tion." "Good!" cried Walter; "or, what is infinitely better, a case of
                suicide-despair on being abandoned by his beloved mistress. Excellent 1" "I could
                tell you some singular freaks of monkeys," said Pollen; "but let us first hang up
                this gentleman." The work was- oon accomplished, but not without danger to the young
                gentlemen, for their vision was becoming con- fused, and their steps unsteady under
                the influence of their excessive libations. The three jovial comrades then sallied
                forth into the street, their arms interlocked, and humming snatches from the opera
                in the moonlight. "Be cautious, young gentlemen I " said a watchman, meet- ing them.
                "Why?" asked Pollen. "Are you a pick-pocket?" asked Parke. "I shall keep my eye on
                you," replied the watchman. And if you do," said Walter, "you will not see straight
                again during the remainder of your life, for I believe there is an obliquity in our
                course.' "Yes," said Parke; "and every five minutes brings us against a wall, or
                over the curb." "My thoughts are mounting upward,' said Pollen-" earth vanishes from
                my vision. I see meteors and coruscations. They are the flashy novelists and poets
                forced into being by par- tial critics. They fill the atmosphere-they go out like
                rockets -but the blue vault above is gemmed by illuminating stars that will remain
                for ever. The vagabond Pollen-sneered at by splay-footed English compilers, frowned
                upon by Scotch librarians, slighted by publishers, slandered by his rivals- will
                take his place among them, and east his rays upon the world i" "What is that, poetry
                or prophecy?" asked Parke. NIGHT HAWKS. 43 "Irreverent interlocutor! It is true,
                lamentably, a pro- phet is without Honor in his own country. I will reap the honors
                bestowed in other countries." "But will you live to enjoy them?" asked Walter. "No,
                I suppose not; therefore I enjoy them now-in anticipation. Ha! ha! ha! I wonder if
                Abraham has any such enjoyment?" "Halt! Steady I " said Parker, as the three
                companions were confronted by several gaudily-dressed persons who ran against them;
                "Who are you?" demanded Pollen. "Fairies," said one of them. "We heard you talking
                of the sky and the stars." "Night hawks, you mean. Avaunt! Off, I say!" con- tinued
                Pollen, endeavoring to thrust away the one that clung to him. "Begone to your
                dripping caves; we are not the prey you seek. The shirt I wear is borrowed--" "But
                your breath smells of good wine." "iDo you covet it? Off, I say! My sword! Oh, that
                I had one! Boys, she has torn my bosom." "What now?" demanded the watchman,
                appearing before them. "I said I'd keep an eye on you!" "You neglect your duty,
                sir!" said Walter. "While you are watching us, who are gentlemen and peaceable, you
                permit us to be beset by these-" "What?" demanded one of the strangers. "Street
                harpies." "That will not do," was replied. Pollen turned aside with his companions,
                leaving the guardian of the night engaged in amicable converse with the harpies. The
                poet had a well-founded dread of the watchman's rattle, for he had been more than
                once an involuntary lodger at'the depot of nocturnal offenders. And Walter and
                Parke, not relishing the idea of an ad- venture with the police, to which they were
                conscious of being liable, from the excited condition of their intellects, agreed to
                return to the mansion, and finish the night under a friendly shelter, and where they
                could not be subjected to any unplea- sant interruptions. By means of a night-key,
                which Walter had taken the precaution to furnish himself with, the door was opened
                and <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6922-00000028"/> " THE WINKLES. they entered in triumph. But an unforesqn disappointment awaited
                them. "What does this mean?" exclaimed they upon closing the door, and finding
                themselves in impenetrable darkness. "Biddyl Where are you? Why did you put out the
                lights?" cried Walter, groping his way through the hall. "Softly, gentlemen," said
                he; " let us get back into the dining-room. Hold each other's skirts, and proceed in
                Indian file." "Out here, too," said Parker, when they reached the dining-room. "Who
                has matches?" "Not I," said Walter, "nor do I know where to find them. Let us go up
                stairs and rouse Biddy. How dark!" he continued, as they ascended the stairs,
                feeling their way. "Not a star blinks upon us," said Pollen. "Nor a meteor's
                ineffectual fire," said Parker. After ascending several flights of stairs, the party
                paused and felt for the chamber doors, and not knowing which might be occupied by
                the housemaid. "I doubt if Biddy is here," said Walter, in a whisper. "My aunt, I
                suspect, makes her sleep in the attic." "Where poverty-stricken poets repose," said
                Pollen. "But the door opens," said Walter. "If we find beds let us lie down till
                morning lights- the orient, and not trouble the servants." "Agreed!?" was the
                response of the others. In a short time two beds were found; but before our ad-
                venturers had begun to undress themselves, their ears were saluted by frightful
                cries and screams. "Who can they be?" said Walter. "Three different voices, and all
                females. Biddy!" "Emily!" "Clara!" "Oh, Mary-sister! Thieves! Robbers!" "Murder!"
                Such were the cries proceeding in quick succession from the beds. "Hold fast to my
                coat-tail, George," whispered Walter, leading the way out into the passage. "We are
                in the wrong mansion I My aunt's night-key fits her neighbor' door I Let us get out

                trembling violently, upon, hearing a window thrown up, and vociferous cries for the
                police. And the next moment several rattles were sprung, and hoarse voices and the
                trampling of heavy feet could be distinguished in the street. "What's this?" asked
                Walter, pausing in his retreat, and finding his hand resting upon a round, smooth
                surface. "It is warm A man's bald head, by Jupiter!" "Have mercy upon me and my poor
                daughters,' said the crouching father of the alarmed family. Walter recognized the
                voice of a distinguished professor, the occupant of the house; and without replying
                he passed on, followed by his companions, clinging to each other. They proceeded
                beyond the turning which would have conducted them down stairs, and wandered into
                the rear building, where they confronted the old housekeeper in her chemise. She
                fell speechless and fainting, and they stumbled over her, falling in a heap beyond.
                But there was no time for idle delay. The police had burst open the front door, and
                one or two shots from revolvers had already been fired at random in the darkness.
                "Here's a room open!" said Walter, with his hand on-the latch of a door at the
                extreme end of the long back building. "In there!" said the poet. "They have a
                light, and are pursuing us!" They entered, and found the apartment un- carpeted, and
                could distinguish objects in it, for the moon shone through the window. "A store
                room, filled with barrels!" said Walter. "And here are empty ones on this side,"
                said Parker. "Let us hide ourselves in them-quick!" said Pollen, They did so, and
                ceased to speak for many minutes, while the police searched in other places for the
                burglars. "We have escaped, I think," whispered Walter. "How the deuce are we to get
                dut?" asked Parker. "Walter, old fellow, you've got me into a d-1 of a scrage." "It
                is an adventure. Consider the fun I Won't we laugh I But my aunt must never hear of
                it. I can venture to tell Virginia." "Hist! I hear them yet!' said Pollen. "If we
                are found the whole world will know it, for the press will speak with a million
                tongues." <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6922-00000029"/> " THE WINKLES. "If they catch us, Walter," said Parke, "we must
                not let them know who we are. I'll be John Smith, and you John Jones." "But I am
                known," said the poet, "and shall be re- cognized." "True," said Walter. "That is
                the misery of being distinguished. We will stand by each other, and share the same
                fate. Besides, we can easily escape by explaining frankly the mistake. Perhaps they
                will suppress our names. The adventure itself, however, must be related, and the
                whole town be set to guessing. Be quiet. I hear some one coming this way. Hush!
                you'll betray us by such sneezing." "Curse the flour! I can't help it!" said Pollen,
                who, with Parke, kept up an incessant sneezing, the sounds of which they vainly
                strove to suppress. "Listen!" said a voice in the passage. "Here they are I "The
                next moment the door was thrown open, and a flood of light poured in. Three or four
                policemen entered, each holding a revolver in the- left hand and a mace in the
                other. They were followed by the fat professor, holding in his hands, which trembled
                very much, a large blunderbuss. The rear was brought up by several servants armed
                with pokers and carving-knives; while at a distance behind, might have been dimly
                seen the old housekeeper, brandishing a long- handled broom. "I--I don't see them
                here," said the professor, after glancing his eyes fearfully round the room, and
                breaking the silence that had ensued after the party had entered. "But they are
                somewhere on the premises, and one of them put his hand on my head." His head was
                now covered with a silken cap. Pollen sneezed again just as he ceased speaking. (

                surrender, we'll send a shower of balls through the staves." "We'll surrender, of
                course," said Pollen; " we are with- out arms." "We'll not take your word for that,"
                said the officer. "Rise and show yourselves." A NIGHT IN PRISON. 47 All three stood
                up. Mercy on us! Oh Lud!" cried the cook and coachman, starting back, and rushing
                away over the prostrate form of their master, who nevertheless rolled and scrambled
                out of the room. Their affright was natural enough, for our young ad- venturers who
                had entered the barrels in black, now appeared in white. Even their faces and hands
                were thickly covered with flour. "It was only a mistake," said Walter. "We came
                hither with no evil intent, but merely entered the wrong house by mistake. We
                thought we were in the adjoining building, and were about to retire, as we supposed,
                to our beds'-" "Here are their hats," said Mary, the oldest of the pro- fessor's
                daughters, now venturing to join the policemen. That story won't do," said the
                policeman, bowing to the "We'll see. No more words. I don't want to hear a syllable.
                You are our prisoners. Seize them, men ' They were seized and conducted out. But as
                they passed through the hall, Mary with seeming pity gave them their hats, while the
                other sisters standing aloof, gazed at them without symp. toms of alarm. Unwilling
                to hear any thing their captives might have to say in Justification of their
                conduct, although it was easily per- ceptible from their manners and speeches that
                they were not common burglars, the policemen hurried them away to prison, and locked
                them up in a room where there were many of- fenders who had been taken that night.
                "Angels and ministers of grace defend us! was the exclamation of an actor, confined
                with the rest, upon seeing our adventurers advance after the heavy door had been
                locked upon them. "We have not committed any crime,"i paid Parke, glanc. ing round
                at the staring company of men and women; some seated upon benches, and others lying
                on the straw. "We were merely on a lark, after enjoying our champagne. We are
                gentlemen." <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6922-00000030"/> 48 THE WINKLES. "Not gentlemen ob color!" said a corpulent
                Negro. This was followed by a boisterous explosion of laughter at the expense of the
                young men, whose whitened exterior alone was sufficiently provocative. "I'm on the
                bench," said the actor (which was literally true), and will hear your cause."
                "Agreed!" cried many of the company, crowding round. "Let us hear what they have to
                say for themselves. "Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,' "said Pollen,
                standing forth, and lifting his hand, "I will, with your per- mission, relate the
                manner of our coming hither." "No!-Yes!-It is!" cried the actor; rushing forward and
                embracing the poet, whom he had recognized, notwithstanding his mask of flour.
                "Mum!" whispered Pollen; don't betray me to this vile herd." The poet had written a
                play in which the actor had represented one of the characters. "Proceed," said the
                judge, resuming his seat, amidst shouts of laughter at his ludicrous appearance,
                having robbed the poet of half his flour. Then Pollen, concealing names and
                localities, succinctly narrated the adventures of his companions and himself. At the
                conclusion, the company pronounced a unanimous acquittal, which was ratified by the
                judge. "And now, Mr. Glass," said Pollen, addressing the actor, "pray tell us what
                brought you here." "Intoxication, and' grief, and damning a watchman who stared at
                me impertinently. You smile at the word grief, but I amiserious, as these tears-a
                man's tears-may attest. rMy Dilly-I mean my daughter, my only child--was entrapped,
                and taken away from me last week. Every body knows how glorious was her debut, and
                that she has ever since been greeted by rapturous applause- at every subsequent
                appear- ance. She was rising, I declining. But just when I had reason to believe her
                capable of relieving me of a portion of my bur- den of toil and care, the tempter
                came I Arich man-" "A d-- rascal 1" "Most assuredly he was, my friend," continued
                the actor. "He said he wished to rescue her from the dangers of the profession. By
                costly presents, and seemingly parental af- fection-for he was twice her age-he
                induced her to desert the stage, upon which her father had w6n distinction, and to
                promise him to abandon it for ever. Many propositions he QUEER COMPANIONS. 49 made
                her; but the only one she listened to was that she should, under an assumed name,
                take up her residence in some respectable boarding-house in New York, until her
                education was completed. She left me more than a week ago. A letter in her chamber
                was filled with pledges of filial af- fection, and resolutions to preserve her
                honor. I find that my salary has been increased through some mysterious agency; but
                my happiness is all gone. I drag heavily through my part every night, and then seek
                to drown my woe in deep libations. I lodge here, where alone I find honest
                sympathy." "It is a rascally world, Mr. Glass-this company ex- cepted," said Pollen.
                "Oh, that I could find a true Ame- rican! The plays, the operas, the ballets, are
                usurped by foreigners! Foreign literature alone is lauded-the critics are
                foreigners, and monarchical- and aristocratic modes of thought, feeling and action,
                are fermented through every pore of the Republic. We get our manners from the
                British, our costumes from the French, our wines from the Germans, our voters from
                Ireland and our religion from Rome! Our libra- riansa-re Scotchmen. They not only
                exclude my books from their shelves, but laugh in my face whenever I look over their
                catalogues! "No doubt my evil tormentor Ralph is of foreign extrac- tion," said
                Glass. "Ralph? Did you say Ralph?" asked Walter, roused from an apparent lethargy he
                had fallen into. Parke was snoring on a bench. "Yes-Ralph Roland!" "I know him. I
                would advise you to get your daughter away as soon as possible." "I need not be
                advised! I want only the means of doing so. Thank heaven, I have cause to be
                confident of the im- pregnability of my daughter's virtue against a million rou6s
                and rakes in arms! WThat alone sustains me." Towards morning all the inmates became
                silent. Some of them brooded over their troubles, while others slept. In the
                morning, a confidential note written by Walter to Profes- sor Point, caused a speedy
                liberation of the three jovial com- panions. Pollen then interested himself in the
                actor's behalf, and easily succeeded with his honor the mayor, whose sym- pathy with
                the sons of genius or of Momus, was never ap- pealed to in vain. 3 <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6922-00000031"/>
                W50 TlTHE WINKLES. CHAPTER V. SEOCET PLOTTINGS-THE FROG HUNTER-MUSHROOMS AND PATTY
                PANS. WE have seen that the appearance of Bill Dizzle, the frog hunter, at Mrs.
                Winkle's, with the beautiful tom-cat, put an immediate end to the game of whist.
                Miss Griselda Gusset departed immediately after, and was met a few steps from Mrs.
                Winkle's door by Ralph Roland, who drew her arm through his and led her into the
                obscurity under a large syca- more-tree that stood on the opposite side of the
                street. "Well, Gusset," said Roland, in a low voice, pausing under the great tree, "
                is my peace truly made with the infernal old maid? Bill Dizzle says so, but he don't
                know always what he says." "It is, indeed. But why have you taken such pains to
                please her? You don't wish to marry her." "Marry her! No-but you know Lucy is the
                most charm- ing creature in the world, and as the family in Babbleton are likely to
                become dependent on the old maid, it will follow that Miss Wilsome's caprices shall
                be respected by her niece." "But, really, are you in love with Lucy? '
                "Desperately!" "And Virginia? "Quite as deeply!" You are a Turk! But you can't marry
                them both." "Leave that to me. I believe Virginia Oakdale is in love with Walter,
                and Lucy with this mysterious Lowe--a fellow low enough, I doubt not, polished as he
                is in manners. Now, my happiness depends upon the utter frustration of the hopes and
                calculations of them all-and you must aid me, as I am aiding you." "What have you
                done for me?" "I rode to the Emperor's to-night just after his startling
                cannonading. He was in one of his finest humors; and when he asked if all the good
                people of Babbleton were not abusing him, I told him you were delighted with his
                military celebra- tions, and only regretted you were not a man to join him, and
                DESIGNS UPON THE EMPEROR. 51 share the pleasure of fighting all of Bonaparte's
                battles over again." "What did he say to that?" "Gad, he said you were the only
                national woman he knew, and that if he were ten years younger he would marry you."
                "He did? Did he say that to you?" "Certainly--and he'll say the same thing the next
                time he meets you, if his sister or sister-in-law be not present to intimidate him.
                It is singular that one so indomitable and self-willed in the field, should be so
                pusillanimous and impres- sible in the house, when plied by the women." "But what
                did you say, when he made that remark?" Oh, I told him that he was quite young
                enough; that no doubt you would accept such an offer, and if you did, he would
                possess a meek and sympathizing coadjutor in his wife." "I thank you, Mr. Roland-and
                I will assist you in all your innocent love schemes to the utmost of my poor
                ability." "One good turn deserves another, you know; and I rely upon your superior
                understanding to find out something about this Mr. Lowe, which may be of service to
                me. Oh, I forgot The great Napoleon, learning that his sisterqhas arrived, is to
                make amends for some old affront, by inviting a party to play whist at his house. I
                have arranged it so that you shall be there, to make up the game. I detest it
                myself, and the old gentleman cannot be relied upon. So I fear this infernal Lowe
                will also be required." Miss Wilsome will have him for her partner." 'I feared it. I
                might get Col. Oakdale-but his hard swearing and sudden impulses are not to be
                trusted." "How would old Mr. Dowley answer?" "John Dowley? He could hardly be
                induced to ride within a mile of the premises. He believes old Winkle is mad, and
                should be confined. If the old maid insists upon having Lowe, she cannot be baulked.
                But he must be closely watched. Good-night. I will see the Emperor in the morn- ing,
                and cause him to dwell upon the idea of an Empress. I will tender him my carriage to
                send for the ladies. You know it requires four horses to drag his. There will be
                seats for four--and you must contrive to occupy one of them." <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6922-00000032"/> 52 THE WINKLES. They
                parted, and pursued different directions. And a third person, who had been listening
                in an arbor, separated only by a plank fence from the street, glided into the
                cottage to which the garden was attached. This was Lowe's old housekeeper. She
                entered the young man's chamber, as she was privileged to do at all times, without
                ceremony. Her master was sitting at a table covered with books and papers, where he
                had been writing. Seeing by the excited features of his old servant that something
                out of the usual routine of do- mestic occurrences was to be communicated, he leaned
                back calmly in his great chair and awaited the issue. The handsome features of Lowe
                did not undergo the slight- est alteration during the housekeeper's recital, with
                the ex- ception of a scarcely perceptible shade on his pale forehead, flitting
                momentarily past, when the name of Lucy Winkle was mentioned in connection with his
                own. "You are discreet, Mrs. Edwards," said Lowe, when she ceased speaking. "I do
                not perceive any reason why I should be disquieted by the surmises of the people, it
                is the case every where. One's neighbors would know one's occupation, place of
                nativity, means of support, objects and desires. Very well. If I do not choose to
                tell them, let them guess. It cannot annoy me. But it must not affect Miss Winkle's
                peace of mind, either. Therefore, Edwards-No. I will remain. She is a fine lovely
                girl, and as pure and amiable as lovely. I have seen Mr. Roland. He is a bad man.
                Well, I have also seen roues--often. Like the rest, he is a contriver of strata-
                gems. . What is the name of the dirty-faced boy who delivered the peace-offering to
                the aunt?" "Bill Dizzle, your honor." "He, too, is employed by him. Where is he
                now?" "In the kitchen with the cook, your honor." "I suppose so. The enemy's camp is
                the place for a spy. But that lad is not bad by nature. Send him to me." The
                frog-catcher appeared at the door with his invariable smile, his long locks, and his
                mud-colored cap on his head. "Come in, Bill," said Lowe, "I want a conversation with
                you. Sit down. I believe I am your best customer in this village; eh?" "They say
                frogs is nasty 1" "And mushrooms?" "They're afeard of being pisoned!" THE FROG
                CATCHER. 53 "But you and I know better.' "And Sargent Blore, and the emperor." "Yes.
                And do we consume all you can procure? "The sargent eats a dozen hind-quarters at a
                time-and your ooman pays me four dollars a week. He! he! he! how the butcher would
                stare if he knowed it! But Mrs. Edards bound me not to tell. People say you must be
                poor, you buy so little, and live in such a little house." "Be sure, Bizzle --"
                "Dizzle-Biddy calls me Bizzle." "Well. Be sure always to make Mrs. Edwards pay you
                the money down, so that if we run away, you will lose no- thing. ' "I aint afeard.
                Sargent Blore says he'll pay Mrs. Ed- ards' debts if she can't. He says he's irn
                love with her, cause she is sensible 'nuff to 'preciate frogs and mush- roons-" "The
                himpudent one-harmed, one-heyed, one-legged himp of satan!" said Mrs. Edwards,
                coming in at that moment with some dew-moistened roses, and with a face flushed to
                the eyebrows. "Edwards," said Lowe, smiling, "you must not be angry with the
                sergeant for admiring you. You can't prevent it and he can't help it." "She's gone,
                like a shot," said Bill, as the old woman vanished muttering something to herself.
                "You must not say a word about this to the sergeant, Dizzle." "No, sir. If I was to,
                he'd be dead sure to come and marry her in spite of herself. I know his natur, sir."
                "Eh? Then you may tell him. I should like to witness the progress of such a siege.
                But, Bill, don't Mr. Roland sometimes throw profitable jokes in your way?" "He's
                always paying me for doing something or other. He's a rich gentleman-and he's good
                to me and my sister." "Your sister?" "Yes. He let's her have her cabin and patch for
                nothing. I stay with her sometimes, and sometimes at the emperor's. I would like to
                stay here a little, too, if you've no objection." "I have none in the world. But why
                would you like to stay here a little? 'Cause Patty O'Pan, in the kitchen, is good to
                me; and <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6922-00000033"/> 54 THE WINKLES. she shows me how to cook frogs in every way-and
                she knows a mushroon from a frog-stool--and she lets me buss her." "Buss her? What's
                that? Oh, I recollect. I suppose that's one of her sauces. But your sister-has she a
                fam- ily '" "Only one-a little gal. I don't know where it's from, or how it come
                there. Them two and me is all." "Is she a widow? '" "She wasn't never married, sir,
                that I knows on." "Oh, I forgot that. Then, Mr. Roland likes you to tell him all the
                news you hear, and all the things you see, and he pays you for your trouble?" "Yes,
                sir. But Mrs. Edards won't say anything, and Patty O'Pan don't know nothing." "But
                you can see for yourself." "I see only you, and your books, and such things. But
                that's not what he wants." "What does he want?" "He wants to find out if you aint a
                counterfeiter, a gambler, a robber, a murderer, or something of that sort." "And do
                you think I am any of these, Bill?" asked Lowe, smiling. "Blazes! No. You're a
                gentleman, and a nicer one nor him." "Thank you, Dizzle. There's a dollar. Now
                remember, we are to be good friends, and you shall come when you choose to see my
                Patty Pan-" "I called her that once, sir, and she slapped my jaws." "O'Pan, then.
                But you must not repeat my conversation to him." "I won't tell only what you want me
                to." "You may say I am very poor, and can't get any employ- ment. That will do."
                "La! I saw you pitch out the trout once! and knock dowt the ducks right and left as
                they sailed round! If you'd only go in partnership with me, and let me sell 'em in
                the city, we'd make a fortin!" "We'll talk that over some other time. Good-by, now."
                Bill bowed unconsciously and withdrew. 4 THE WINKLE CHATEAU. 55 CHAPTER VI. THE
                WINKLE CHATEAU-THE GAME RESUMED. MR. ROLAND'S carriage, containing Miss Wilsome
                Winkle and her neice, Mr. Lowe and Gusset, drove up to the portico of Mr. Napoleon
                Winkle's fine mansion. Sentinels, in trappings resembling the uniform of the
                imperial guard, were pro- menading in front. These were some of Mr. Winkle's tenan-
                try, who had been drilled that morning by Sergeant Blore. Mr. Winkle was seated in
                his great chair in his library, looking over sundry charts spread out on a table. He
                was dressed in the old style, wearing tight breeches, silk stockings, and shoes and
                buckles. We have said he was fat. He was also nearly bald. When the company was
                announced, he arose and advanced with dignity. But the one whom he first accosted
                with friend- ly greeting was Gusset. "Why, brother," said Miss Wilsome, "where are
                your glasses? That is Gusset! Don't you know me?" "Certainly I do, sister," he
                replied, shaking her hand very heartily-"I did not look at-her face, and supposed it
                was my niece." "She don't resemble Lucy. But let me introduce Mr. Lowe, my partner
                at whist." I am happy to- see you, Mr. Lowe," said Mr. Winkle, with great
                politeness; and then, a moment after, added: Lowe-Lowe-I have heard that name before
                " "Oh, very likely, sir, as I have been residing in Babbleton a number of weeks,"
                remarked the young man. "Lowe! I hope, sir, your first name is not Hudson?" "It is
                not, sir. It is Edmund." "You are not a son of Sir Hudson's?" I "I am not, indeed,"
                continued Lowe, smiling. "What nonsense, brother," said Miss Wilsome. "Sir Hudson
                was a middle-aged man when Governor of St. Hel- ena; and as Bonaparte died a quarter
                of a century ago--" "Very true, Wilsome-very true. Come, have my arm. The table is

                are refreshments on the sideboard. Let the young people follow." "Where is Mr
                Roland?" asked Wilsome, looking round in vain for that gentleman, upon entering the
                room in which they were to play. "I have a note from him," said her brother,
                fumbling for it in his vest pocket. "He says he has been suddenly called away in a
                matter of great urgency and importance; and that he may not possibly be able to
                return before the even- ing." "No matter!" said Wilsome, in her masculine voice. "He
                pays no attention to the game. What shall we do? Lucy is not fond of whist, and
                would rather be rambling about the grounds. Mr. Lowe plays admirably, but he is my
                part- ner. How shall we be matched?" "I'll have Miss Gusset-and see if we don't beat
                you the first rubber! Where is she? Left in the library! What barbarians we are!
                But, n'importe; I will conduct her hither." Mr. Napoleon Winkle withdrew for that
                purpose, and seemed to remain away something longer than his sister deemed
                necessary, and she awaited him with a fretful imapa- tience, while Lucy and Lowe
                admired the prospect from a window. The lagging behind in the lilrary had not been
                accidental on the part of Gusset. But what transpired there, between herself and Mr.
                Winkle, must remain among the undeveloped secrets of diplomacy, for there were no
                witnesses present to divulge it. Yet it might have been surmised from the agreea-
                ble expression of their countenances when they finally appeared and assumed their
                places at the table, that the brief conference which had been held, like that of the
                famous emperors at Til- sit, had not been an unpleasant one. When they commenced the
                game, Lucy escaped through the large French window, and was soon careering over the
                lawn, followed by her faithful spaniel. When, panting with the exercise, and laden
                with roses, she ascended a small knoll a hundred paces from the house, and rested in
                a turret or pa- vilion, which had been constructed by her uncle for his own
                convenience. This small isolated building, resembling a light- house, in having
                windows on every side, was so thickly over- grown with vines that one could view
                from within it every field DEW'S DISLIKE. 57 on the plantation (or country in
                Europe), and remain himself unseen. From this place most of (the Winkles) Napoleon's
                or- ders of a military character were issued. Lucy, amidst the perfume of her roses
                and honeysuckles, the thrilling echoes of the orioles from the tall elms, the pure
                sunlight of a calm day, the harmonious buzzing of insects through the peaceful air,
                yielded to the influence of the mo- ment, and almost unconsciously warbled one of
                the happy songs which occasionally gushed forth from her innocent heart. "Why, Dew!"
                said she, ceasing abruptly in the midst of a stanza, as she heard a low growl from
                her spaniel; " that is a horrid accompaniment. If my ditty is displeasing, you shall
                hear no more of it. What is the matter? How his eyes do gleam! Dew!" The spaniel
                sprang up and barked fiercely; and the next moment Mr. Ralph Roland emerged from a
                clus- ter of lilac bushes near the pavilion. "Be quiet, Dew," said he. "Don't you
                know me?" he con- tinued, ascending the steps of the pavilion, and casting a half-
                careless glance at the still threatening dog, as it growled and whined after
                returning to the feet of its mistress. "Mr. Roland," said Lucy, "I thought you were
                to be ab- sent-to-day. Did you not say so in a note to my uncle?" "I did, my dear
                creature," said he, throwing himself into a rustic seat beside her; " but it was
                merely a stratagem for your benefit." "My benefit! How, sir?" You know, if I had
                been present, your aunt would have compelled me to playr and so you would have been
                under the necessity of entertaining your uncle, or of being entertained by him."
                "And I assure you I am always very agreeably entertained by him! Yet I am not quite
                certain your presence would have released my uncle from the game. He seemed to be
                en- joying it very heartily when I left them." "Oh, Gusset was his partner!" "How
                did you know that? Mr. Roland, it seems to me very mysterious, that you should be
                observing what passes in the house-or chateau, as my uncle calls it-remaining your-
                self unseen. And, then, appearing suddenly before me from a covert, unannounced---"
                "Dew announced me," said he, smiling, and taking ip one of the roses Lucy had
                dropped. 3* <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6922-00000035"/> 58 THE WINKLES. "Yes, he announced you; but it was no friendly
                greeting. I have some faith in Dew's discernment." "Upon my soul," said Roland,
                laughing, "I am inclined to believe you are serious, for you have done nothing but
                frown ever since you beheld me." "And Dew has never ceased to show his teeth," said
                she. "Oh, I will love Dew, if he will permit me. You recol- lect the saying-' Love
                me, love my dog.' But, seriously, my, dear Miss Winkle, whether it shall ever be my
                good fortune to conciliate Dew or not, believe me, upon the honor of a man, that I
                have long loved you--" "Mr. Roland " cried she, attempting to rise, while Dew, not
                knowing whether or not his mistress was held contrary to her will, crouched at her
                feet, his eyes fixed with a steady fierceness upon Roland's face. "Stay, my sweet
                Lucy," said Roland. "You know I am rich. I am not old. All I possess-my heart, my
                hand, my fortune-are at your feet-- Deuce take the dog " cried he, starting up, and
                shaking Dew from the skirt of his coat, upon which the animal had fastened. Feeling
                himself slightly bruised by the teeth of the dog, he bestowed a smart kick upon him,
                and sent him yelping under Lucy's chair. "Mr. Roland-leave me " said Lucy. "Be not
                offended, my sweet girl," continued the wooer. "My proposals are honorable, and you
                shall be--" "Say no more, sir. It is distressing to me. I cannot love you.. Let that
                suffice." "You might, in time. But if you did not, that would be my misfortune. As
                for yourself, be assured I love you now, have loved you long, and would continue to
                do so for ever." "Cease, cease this conversation, Mr. Roland; and let me return to
                the house. It is painful to hear you. I would not have you love me, and you can
                never have either my heart or my hand." "Cruel Lucy! But you are now discomposed.
                Calm re- flection, and the advice of your family, may change your mind. Recollect
                that you may be disappointed in your expectations. Your aunt is capricious, and your
                uncle may marry." Sir, my mother's humble dwelling would be preferable to all the
                wealth in the world, if obtained by means of an alliance with one whose presence
                would be an unceasing source of dis- gust and misery " THE PROGRESS OF THE GAME. 59
                "Unjust and unreasonable girl I Think that the humble dwelling and the few pitiful
                acres you allude to, do not belong to your mother." "How, sir?" "The property is
                encumbered. There is a mortgage on it for three-fourths its value. Then be not so
                disdainful. You are poor, and I am rich." "Release me, sir!" continued Lucy,
                striving in vain to escape, while Dew continued to bark. ' If I am poor, sir, I am
                independent. Beware how you insult me." "I do not insult you, my dearest girl," said
                Roland. "I would save you from the sneers of the world. The offer I make cannot be
                deemed an insult. I would save you---!' "From what, sir? Nobody has sneered at me."
                "I would save you from the fatal toils of an impostor-- " "Who?" "That man now
                sitting opposite your aunt. You know not who he is-whence he comes-his
                occupation-his charac- ter--"--- "Sir, you do insult me-or at least you grossly
                offend, by such gratuitous declaration " said Lucy, blushing deeply, and then
                turning deathly pale. "I see how it is, Lucy. I should have warned you sooner. I
                will release you now. I desire you will consult your mother and your uncle. In their
                hands and yours I place my hopes. Farewell-or if we meet again to-day, pray banish
                that frown." "Mr. Roland," replied the girl, now released, but no longer inclined to
                fly, "leave me to my solitary meditations. But, before you go, be assured that I
                will never love or wed you. It will not be necessary for me to mention the subject
                to any one, unless you resolve to persecute me with your addresses, which would only
                give me pain. My mother and uncle, what- ever might be their opinion or desire,
                would never attempt to constrain me to any step repugnant to my wishes. Therefore,
                if you would have my respect and friendship, never again refer to the subject." "At
                least, you can have no objection," said Roland, throw. ing a scrutinizing glance at
                the fair girl as he departed, " to my unmasking the impostor who has taken such
                convenient lodgings in Babbleton . " <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6922-00000036"/> 60 THE WINKLES. "I have no right to object,
                sir, to any thing in which I am not interested." "Then why that change of color,
                Lucy?" "I see it not, sir. Mr. Roland, take care that you do not injure an innocent
                person! Mr. Lowe is not the base man you suppose, Beware how you assail a stranger,
                of whom you know nothing, upon the mere conjectures of the idle gossips of the
                village! However, I doubt not he will be prepared to vindicate himself, whenever any
                one shall venture to charge him with the commission of a criminal act. And until he
                fails to repel any such affronts upon his character, rely upon it, he will be
                received as a welcome guest at my mother's humble dwelling." When she ceased
                speaking, Roland retired without utter- ing any reply; and the brave girl
                immediately bestowed all her attention upon poor Dew, whom she caressed for his
                timely defence of his mistress. Soon after Roland might have been seen galloping
                through a distant lane towards his own estate. And at intervals mes- sengers on
                horseback were sent by Sergeant Blore, from dif- ferent parts of the Winkle empire,
                with despatches for his chief. So that a continual clatter of hoofs was kept up
                during the progress of the game. CHAPTER VII. THE GAME INTERRUPTED BY THE NEWS OF A
                SUDDEN INVASION. "READ that despatch for me, partner," said Mr. Winkle, passing a
                small square piece of paper across the table to Gus- set. It had just been brought
                in by one of Sergeant Blore's messengers. "Why don't you read it yourself?" asked
                Wilsome, lifting her eyes from the cards in her hand. "Because, sister, I left my
                glasses in my cabinet; and al- though I can distinguish the knave of hearts without
                them, I would find it difficult to decipher Blore's confounded crabbed pencil
                scratches. And I doubt whether you could do it with- AN INVASION. 61 out your
                spectacles, which I am sure you are ashamed to wear in company." "I am not ashamed,
                brother." Gusset reads: "The old boar and a flock of crows are eating the dead horse
                in the north fields." "What does that mean, brother?" demanded Miss Wil- some. "It
                means that the Russians and the Cossacks are nib- bling again at the Pole. No
                matter, so they don't disturb Saxony. Such is my answer." As the game proceeded, the
                following additional notes were received, and read by the milliner, while Mr. Lowe,
                with much difficulty, preserved his gravity. ' The Billy goats arefighting again on
                the' ill." "The Swiss!" said Mr. Winkle. "The cantons are never quiet. They will
                have to be absorbed. Tell Blore to have them chastised, and warned. He may fire a
                few pla- toons with blank cartridge." . After this a long silence ensued, and Gusset
                played a great many trumps, which, with the four honors she held, won the game. "It
                is my turn to shuffle. There will be no more such hands!" said Miss Wilsome, casting
                an ill-natured glance at the milliner. It is game and game. This time we will win
                the rubber." And it seemed that the prediction so confidently made, was about to be
                fulfilled; for the first hand won nine tricks. The honors were divided between Miss
                Wilsome and her part- ner, as well as all the valuable cards. It was just when Miss
                Wilsome was exulting over such signal success, and anticipating a speedy triumph,
                that one of the sentinels ran in and made the following announcement which he said
                the sergeant did not have time to write: "The bull's swam across the slough, sir,
                and is trying to get into the orchard among the cows." t "We are invaded! The
                British! The British!" cried the old man, leaping up and overturning the table. "My
                these! My horse!" he continued, rushing out upon the lawn. Bring up the guards!
                Sound the alarm I To the field F1ol- low me, soldiers! The enemy is upon our soil!"
                Consternation prevailed. The drum beat to arms, and the sentinels fired their
                muskets; and before Miss Wilsome <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6922-00000037"/> 62 THE WINKLES. had sufficiently recovered
                from her paroxysm of passion to utter a word, her excited brother was in the saddle,
                and gal- loping towards the enemy, at the head of a small party of his retainers.
                They soon reached the scene of the invasion, which was plainly in view from the
                pavilion, and where Lucy was joined by her aunt and her partner, as well as by
                Gusset. The orchard fence ran parallel with the narrow sheet of water which
                separated France from England, as laid down on Mr. Winkle's map. The latter country,
                a marsh meadow, was usually inhabited by the bull, but he was occasionally in the
                habit of making incursions upon the neighboring tracts. The enormous animal was now
                throwing up the earth with his feet, and bellowing fearfully, while the herd of cows
                and heifers within the inclosure, so far from being alarmed at his presence, had
                drawn nearer to the fence which separated them. On rushed Napoleon, followed by his
                little band of heroes. But, fearless and -obedient as they had often proved on other
                oc- casions, they faltered on this, when they perceived, that instead of being
                panic-stricken, the bull faced about and coolly awaited the attack. Turning his
                head, and seeing the hesitation among his followers, Winkle drew rein and ordered
                them to come up. They did so very reluctantly. "Soldiers!" said he, " let me not
                have cause to be offend- ed at your conduct this day. The eyes of my guests in yon-
                der pavilion are upon us!" "But that dratted bull looks like he wanted to poke some
                of us," said one of the guard. "What then? ' exclaimed the furious Winkle. "Are vic-
                tories won without risk of wounds, and even death? Would you purchase glory without
                paying its price in blood? I am ashamed of you! Surrender your gun into the hands of
                that boy in front. Retire in disgrace from the field. You are ig- nominiously
                dismissed I Comrades," he continued, advance and fire. And when you have discharged
                your guns, charge yourselves upon the enemy. He will fly before you!" They formed a
                line in front of the bull, extending from the fence down the water's edge, and
                levelling their guns, fired as they had been ordered. But when the smoke cleared
                away, instead of seeing the bull in full retreat, they beheld him rush- ing directly
                towards them, his head down, and his tail ram- pant over his back. Winkle continued
                to spur forward, but THE MONSTER BULL. 63 his followers took to their heels and fled
                away. Some leaped the fence and climbed the apple trees, while others never paused
                until they were under shelter of the castle. All threw' away their arms. It must be
                owned that Winkle was not insensible to some symptoms of trepidation when he beheld
                the great eyes of his foe glaring upon him. But the eyes in the pavilion were upon
                him also, and it would not do to fly; and although several in- stances occurred to
                his mind wherein his great prototype had embraced the means in his power to escape a
                sudden peril, still he resolved to face the infuriated animal. Yet it should not
                perhaps be denied, that he had some hope of a reconcili- ation at the last moment,
                forgetting that the fatal affront had already been given by himself, in offending
                the nostrils of his enemy with the fumes of sulphur. Therefore, that nothing on his
                part might be omitted, as soon as his followers had receded out of hearing, he
                commenced his overtures as follows :"Come Johnny, my fine fellow, you have taken
                salt from my hand many a time. Be quiet, now-my fine fellow." -Johnny re- cognized
                his master and paused in mid-career, and in the cen- tre of the road, but still kept
                his head down in a menacing attitude. Long he remained thus, as motionless as a
                statue, while a low moan escaped him resembling the deep mutterings preceding an
                earthquake. Winkle, supposing the victory gained, deliberately dis- mounted from his
                horse, and approached Johnny on foot, as he had often done before, for the purpose
                of caressing him. But it did not occur to him that he had never attempted to
                approach the animal with a broad scarlet sash enveloping his chest. Hence, when he
                was within a few paces of his huge minion, he was astonished to see him leap forward
                to meet him more like the spring of a tiger upon a lamb than the motion of friendly
                greeting. Winkle turned, and fled with all his might, without pausing to reflect
                upon the consequences of such an example. But he was too fat to escape by means of
                his own locomotion; and his steed, taking the alarm, had fled away in advance! On
                ran Winkle, and after him the bull, while cries of alarm proceeded from the
                pavilion, and curses were uttered by Ser- geant Blore, who strove in vain to rally
                the men. At last Winkle gave up in despair, and fell down upon his face, just at the
                moment when the bull had slightly turned <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6922-00000038"/> " THE WINKLES. aside one of his
                huge horns for the purpose of transfixing him. Escaping immediate death by his
                opportune relinquishment of the field, Winkle nevertheless felt the point of the
                horn glance harmlessly over the posterior portion of his body. But it ploughed along
                under the broad scarlet sash, and a moment after the corpulent hero was dangling in
                the air! Enraged to desperation upon finding that his victim could not be easily
                detached from his new position, the great monster ran franti- cally to and fro along
                the margin of the water, still bearing his captive aloft, whose legs and arms were
                in continual motion, as if swimming in ether. And now the bull was followed back-
                wards and forwards by all the cows and heifers in the orchard, and by all the
                terriers of the neighborhood, which kept up a continual clatter at his heels. The
                only words the poor man was heard to utter were, "Help! help! rescue! rescue!"
                Witnessing such a scene from the pavilion, Mr. Lowe, touched by the distress of
                Lucy, united his endeavors with those of Sergeant Blore to induce the men to
                got6rthe relief of their chieftain. But to no purpose. They were immovable, and the
                sergeant himself could do nothing, having but one leg, one eye, and one arm. Then
                let loose yonder bull-dog," cried Lowe, "and bid him follow me!" Saying this, the
                young man seized a sheet which had been spread out on the grass by the washerwoman,
                and ran off towards the scene of action. As soon as the bull beheld him he prepared
                for battle. Pawing up the earth, and bellowing furiously, the enormous monster came
                down at full speed, with Winkle still dangling from his right hand horn. Lowe was
                self-possessed. He adjusted the sheet upon his arm in the manner he had seen the
                Spaniards do, and when the criti- cal moment arrived, succeeded admirably in
                throwing it over the animal's head, and in making his escape by springing dex-
                terously aside. The bull, being thus foiled, and blinded by the sheet, shook his
                head violently, and Winkle flew through the air like some great fragment cast up by
                a raging volcano. He sailed over the prickly bushes on the margin of the ditch, and
                fell head foremost among the spatter-docks, which grew half in mud and half in
                water. The place where he fell was as soft as a bed of down. But he came very near
                alighting upon the head of Bill Dizzle, who was so intently engaged in ESCAPE OF
                LOWE. 65 the pursuit of a large frog, that he had not heeded the uproar in the
                vicinity. "Blue blazes! What a tremendous frog!" cried Bill, when Winkle dropped
                into the ditch, bespattering him all over and filling his eyes with filthy water, so
                that for several mo- ments he was incapable of seeing any thing. "No it's a turkle!
                said he, when he had succeeded in wiping the muddy water from his eyes, and beheld
                the crown of Winkle's head emerging from the broad leaves of the. spat- ter docks.
                Both the cocked hat and the wig of Napoleon had been lost, and his bald head having
                been submerged, really resembled in color and shape the back of a turtle or terapin.
                No! Blazes it-no! continued Bill. It's-it's--bla- zes! what is it?" "It's Winkle,
                Bill. Help me out of the ditch. Take me by the hand and lead me. I cannot see." "So
                it is! Oh, gonny! what a black face I Takeholt of the prongs of my spear, sir."
                "Wait a moment, Bill. See if the bull is near us." Bill crept under the bushes
                towards the road and witnessed the finale of the scene. The bull, finding himself
                relieved of the burden which had in some degree embarrassed his movements, soon tore
                off the sheet that obstructed his vision, and more enraged than ever, rushed upon
                his new assailant. But Lowe avoided him by springing behind a tough hickory sapling
                which grew on the side of the road. Although the young tree was not greater in
                diameter than a man's leg, yet it sufficed to repel the as. saults of the frantic
                animal. Whenever the bull made a lunge, the elastic sapling, after yielding an
                instant to the force of the blow, would rebound with such power as to throw back the
                animal on his haunches. The bull, supposing this to be the' resistance of his
                antagonist, grew more incensed than ever, and redoubled his assaults. Finally the
                young tree was yield- ing under the effects of such repeated thrusts, and ceased to
                repel them with the vigor it did at first, and Lowe, expecting every instant to see
                his only remaining defence prostrated, was upon the eve of giving up all for lost,
                when he heard the short deep barking of the bull-dog. A moment after, he saw the
                teeth of his brindle deliverer fastened upon the cheek of the bull. Uttering a
                startling yell, the huge monster threw up his head so violently that the flesh was
                torn away, and the dog <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6922-00000039"/> " THE WINKLES. went sailing over the bushes, and fell
                sprawling into the ditch beside its master. ' Blazes!" cried Bill, who had retreated
                back to his first position-" the frogs will be frightened for a month!' Meantime the
                bull was smarting with the wound he had received, and instead of renewing the attack
                upon Lowe, gazed towards the ditch, as if to ascertain whether the dog was hors de
                combat. But hearing Brindle's sharp bark as soon as his head was above water, the
                great bull, now stricken with terror, turned about and began to retreat. Brindle,
                however, sprang from under the bushes and seized him on the other cheek, and this
                time he held him so firmly that he could not be shaken off. The bull roared, and
                rolled in the dust; bat Brindle would note relinquish his hold. Finally, seeing the
                sergeant at last rallying his forces, which had been suc- cessfully appealed to by
                Lucy to rescue her uncle and the young gentleman, the animal gave up the contest,
                and rushed into the deepest part of the water, where, by dint of submerg- ing his
                head, the half-drowned dog was forced to open his jaws. The bull then escaped into
                his own territory. Lucy, when she witnessed the expulsion of the bull, sup- posing
                her uncle might be slain, and not knowing that Lowe had escaped without injury, was
                overwhelmed with tumultu- ous palpitations, and fainted in the arms of her aunt.
                Now, Wilsome had done nothing but abuse her brother from the moment he abandoned the
                game, when she was upon the eve of winning the rubber. And she was in no pleasant
                humor with 'Lowe for joining in the foolish fracas, as she termed it. More than once
                she had proposed that the game should be concluded with a dummy, as her brother's
                card had been ex- posed. Her own cards were still grasped in her hand when Lucy
                fainted. "Unlace her, Gusset," said Miss Wilsome, with petulance. "Throw out the
                roses, and empty the vase of water in her face-but don't spill any of it on my
                dress." Gusset obeyed with trembling hands, a livid hue, and chattering teeth. "She
                is reviving," said Wilsome. "It wasn't much. My brother is not killed, I know-but if
                he should 'be, what else could he expect, always firing off guns, and fancying boars
                are Russians, and bulls the British. I am his sister, it is true-but I could not
                lament his death as much as a sister THANK HEAVEN, HE IS SAFE. , 67 ought, if he
                were to lose his life in any of these mad pranks. Besides, I abominate black, and
                have made up my mind never to go into mourning. So, if my brother's neck be broken
                by the bull-- " Here she paused, and placing Lucy in the rustic arm-chair, steadily
                regarded Gusset, who was gasp- ing. "Why, Gusset!" she exclaimed, "what in the world
                are you doing? Are you going to swoon, too? He's nothing to you! I tell you what it
                is-if you have the ill-manners to faint before my face, I shall go off and leave you
                to recover the best way you can! It is an impudent, indecent habit I I never
                fainted. So, now, you have some color. But pick up yourcards; they fell with the
                backs up, and I did not see them. The game must be played out. Mercy on us " she
                continued, as she beheld her brother approaching on foot, covered completely with
                the black mud of the marsh, and fol- lowed by the whole rabble of his retainers,
                ever and anon uttering loud huzzas. "Oh, thank heaven, he is safe!" said Lucy.
                "Safe!" cried her aunt. "Do you call him safe in that predicament? He had better be
                dead, than live in such a pickle as that." "The mud can soon be removed!" cried
                Gusset, rising, and seemingly about to rush forward and assist in the purifi- cation
                of the discomfited chieftain. "What do you mean, Gusset?" asked Miss Wilsome, and at
                the same time thrusting back the milliner." If you stir a step towards him and soil
                your hands, I'll send you home, madam. I am mistress here, I would have you know.
                The game must be finished. Let Blore take his master to the pump, and we'll play
                with a dummy." "Fortunately no injury has been done " said Lowe, enter- ing the
                pavilion. "He upset my basket of frogs," said Bill Dizzle, follow- ing, " and they
                all swam away." "I'm glad of it," said Miss Wilsome; " and I hope you may never
                catch them again." Bill gave her a look of mingllD astonishment and contempt, and
                then withdrew. ' You, too, were in great peril," said Lucy, addressing Lowe. "I
                confess that when I saw the roots of the friendly sap- ling yielding to the furious
                assaults of the animal, I measured <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6922-00000040"/> 68 THE WINKLES. the height of the fence with
                my eye, hoping to be able to clear it at one bound. I think I could have done so."
                While her brother was undergoing the prescribed ablution at the pump, Wilsome
                insisted upon the game being played out with a dummy. But when they were seated at
                the table, it was discovered that a card was missing; and luckily for the rest, it
                was one which had fallen from Miss Wilsome's own hand. It could not be found, and so
                a new pack was called for, and a new deal submitted to. But before the thirteenth
                card had been dealt to Dummy, Mr. Napoleon Winkle made his appearance among them, in
                fresh costume, and resumed his seat opposite Miss Griselda Gusset. "Having had a
                tilt with Johnny Bull," said he, in high spirits, " we will now have a bout with the
                four kings." ' Brother, how can you treat a serious matter so lightly," asked Miss
                Wilsome. "If you had witnessed the fainting scene in the pavilion, after your flight
                over the hedge-- '"You did not faint, did you, sister?" "!" "But who did?"
                "Lucy-and---" "Lucy, then, feared to lose her uncle?" ' Certainly, uncle," said
                Lucy. "You are my pet. But did any one else faint? "Gusset would have fainted, if I
                had permitted it," said Solsome. "And I am sure I don't know why she wj ave done
                so." .. r. Winkle cast a meaning glance at Gusset, who kept A-x Heyes fixed upon the
                cards and remained silent. -" "As for my part," said Mr. Lowe, "I must crave Mr.
                Winkle's pardon." "What for?" asked Mr. Winkle. "I thought you had surely observed
                my inexcusable con- duct, sir, at the moment when I encountered the foe." "It was my
                salvation. You did a meritorious action, Rdich I shall never forget. You saved my
                life, sir, and I would be happy to see you an inmate of my family, sir. Why not
                abandon your little tenement, and live with me? You may command any thing that is
                mine, sir." "If you were to do any such thing," said Wilsome, "it * A SUICIDE. 69
                would not be two months before you would be fit for a mad. house." "Pooh sister!"
                said Winkle, "you have your cards, your monkeys, your cats and parrots--every thing
                but a husband- and I have my peculiar amusements. Then why do you con- tinually
                denounce my diversions, and term them the result of insanity?' It is simply because
                you have an idiosyncrasy yourself! Oh, I have been reading a work on madness! I know
                the symptoms. But, Mr. Lowe-I know you are not Sir Hudson, new-why should you crave
                my pardon?" "For my laughter. I could not avoid giving vent to it when I met you
                borne aloft on the bull's horn." "Nor no human being could have refrained from it,"
                said Miss Wilsome, smiling significantly at her partner. "Lucy refrained, and so did
                Miss Griselda!" said Napo- leon. "Gusset thought it her humble duty to follow Lucy's
                swooning example-but I arrested her in time." "If your monkey had been in my
                predicament," continued her brother, "I doubt not you would have manifested more
                concern." "Jocko? Bless my life! I believe I came away without locking his chain to
                my bed-post. And he would not permit any one else to do it! I shall be uneasy until
                I get back to the city." "Here are the city papers," said Mr. Winkle, taking them
                from the hand of one of his servants just returned from the village. "And here is a
                letter for you, Wilsome. Perhaps it contains some account of your dear monkey." a
                And it did. The old lady, in her eagerness to learn tte contents of the letter,
                forgetting the presence of her partner, . adjusted her glasses, and putting down the
                cards, read as follows: "MY DEAR AUNT:--It becomes my melancholy duty to . :.

                whelp!" cried Gusset. "Gusset!" said Miss Wilsome, putting down the letter which she
                had been unconsciously reading aloud, and weeping bitter tears all the while-" how
                dare you call any member of my family a whelp? Do you forget that the Winkles made

                "I was merely jesting." "I thought so, by Jove t" cried the emperor. "She was not in
                earnest, sister. Miss Griselda is famous for her mild temper, and amiability of

                Gusset. ".That's right-love him for my sakbe." "Bring my bonnet! I must go " cried
                Miss Wilsome, rising. "I shall never survive it. My heart is broken. Poor Jocko!"

                woman living capable of appreciating me " "Who2 " demanded his sister. "Not you-but
                you shall know some of these days." "YoUr uncle-intends to marry," Lowe whispered in
                Lucy's ear-" and it may be the wisest thing he could do, for-- " "Mr. Lowe!" said
                Miss Wilsome, "will you not attend me to the carriage?" "Oh, certainly 1" was the
                reply. And rising, the young gentleman conducted the aunt and niece out of the room,
                leaving Mr. Napoleon Winkle and the retired milliner, who had won the rubber at
                last, to follow at their leisure. But their leisure seeming to be too much
                prolonged, Miss Wil- some despatched several messengers to hasten- them; and Gusset
                was finally handed into the coach by no less a gallant than the great proprietor of
                the palace. During the drive back to the village, Lucy and Lowe con- jecturing the
                nature of each other's thoughts-the tragical end of the monkey-could not avoid,
                exchanging mirthful glances, which being perceived by Miss Wilsome, they were
                rebuked in this manner. "How indifferent you both seem to my affliction. Jocko was
                dearer to me than many a husband is to his wife. He was obedient, silent, and
                watchful; and quite as handsome as some of the beaux who captivate our poor hearts.

                contented with my lot. I suppose the law would not have permitted him to have my
                fortune-and in that case you would have inherited it, Lucy. But now I have lost my
                Jocko, and you a fortune-for I will certainly marry." Lucy and Lowe strove to
                elongate their faces upon hearing this announcement-but in vain. <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6922-00000042"/> 72
                - THE WINKLES. CHAPTER VIII. MATRIMONIAL SALLIES-WAR AND WOMEN. ARRIVED at the
                cottage of Mrs. Winkle in Babbleton, the company dispersed as follows. Gusset, who
                had not opened her mouth, although her eyes looked volumes, since she had been
                escorted down the broad stairway of thenchateau by the emperor, hastened away on
                foot to her own domicile, without once casting a glance behind. Edmund Lowe, after
                assisting the ladies to alight, strode deliberately across the street to his own
                dwelling. Miss Wilsome Winkle, with a freshet of tears, washing gullies through the
                paint on her cheeks, has- tened up to her chamber to enjoy in solitude the luxury of
                mourning the loss of a beloved object. Mrs. Winkle, drawing Lucy's arm through her
                own, led her into the rear sitting room, laughing at- the aspect of her
                sister-in-law, and at the mishap of her brother, which had been narrated to her by
                an eye-witness. "Sit down, Lucy," said the merry widow. "I am glad we are alone. You

                entertained in town. Mr. Ralph Roland has spent several hours with me- child! why do
                you turn pale at the mention of his 'name? No! my eyes deceived me-you have a
                beautiful color-but surely I can hear the beating of your heart. I say Mr. Ro- land

                so. But he desired my permission to woo you." "And did he obtain it?" "Not
                positively. But I promised to confer with you. I thought the feliow was addressing
                Virginia Oakdale." "He addresses all who will permit him. I cannot permit him to
                addrtss me, mother. There is something in his smile, in his looks, in his attitudes
                and movements, which fills me with dread and dislike." "He is somewhat advanced in
                years, too; I Blink he must be forty. My dear child, never think I would desire you
                to agree to any match repugnant to your inclinations. "UCY'S SCRUPLES. 73
                Nevertheless, Roland is called a handsome man-is rich, and if not popular, it is
                thought, notwithstanding, his party will succeed in electing him to Congress. On the
                other hand, my child, it is my duty to apprise you that you have no fortune. Even
                this little property is mortgaged for four thousand' dol- lars-and the mortgage is
                held by Mr. Roland---" "Oh, mother!" cried Lucy. "Why do you tremble so? why this
                alarm, my dear Lucy? Have we not been merry in our poverty? Wealth could not have
                made us -more hppy. Besides, we are not so destitute as to be altogether dependent.
                Old Dibble, our gardener, has sold eight hundred dollars worth of vegetables since
                win- ter. He has found out all about my condition, and this mort- gage too, and he
                says there is always a balance to our credit in bank sufficient to pay the
                interest." "Thank heaven! Then he cannot distress us!" said Lucy. "Who, child?" v
                "Roland. Mother, he is a bad man, and I would not be in his power for worlds. But we
                need not be alarmed. Uncle Napoleon----" "Mr. Roland informs me that it is the'
                determination of your uncle to marry. If this be so, we must not rely upon receiving
                further aid from that quarter.. Your uncle, I know, has a very generous disposition;
                but his wife may be different- ly constiuted. Your aunt-..-" "Oh, mother, she too is
                resolved to marry. She announ. ced her purpose to-day." Married or single-she could
                never be relied on. She has too many strange caprices of minor importance, to bestow
                a thought upon the necessities of her relatives. Besides, she never can be convinced
                that your father lost his fortune. She cannot conceive how it could be possible for
                the most re- speuted and ablest member of her family to lose his patri- mony."

                But, my child, we must be kind and respectful. Remember---" "The mortgage! yes, I
                will remember it, mother-and for your sake, 1will endeavor not to offend him." "For
                my sake, Lucy " cried Mrs. Winkle, laughing very heartily. "Why I have no fears.
                Providence will not for- sake me. Old Dibble and his son never fail to raise
                enormous crops of potatoes, cabbages, peas, etc., when such things are scarce and
                high. I suppose if we pay the interest, there can be no danger of being turned
                adrift. And yet, my child, Mr. Roland named one thing which caused me a pang of
                fearful apprehension." "What was it, mother?" "His belief that our pale neighbor,
                Mr. Lowe, had a design upon your heart." "I thought so I He said the same thing to

                pretensions, he would never have sought your ap- probation. I repulsed him, mother.
                I told him, also, that my decision so unhesitatingly pronounced, was irrevocable
                and- final; and then it was that he mentioned Mr. Lowe." "He says there arc strange
                reports in circulation regard- ing him, which, if true- " "Ay, if true, mother! No
                doubt they have been, fabri- cated by Roland himself, or some of the vile creatures

                behalf of this stran- ger. Ha! ha --what would be the effect on him, if he were a
                listener!" . - "He would hear a friend repelling the wicked aspersions of his
                enemies." "But how do you know the reports are false?" "I do not know it, mother-I
                merely believe him inno- cent, until proofs are produced to prove the contrary."
                "That is right, Lucy. It seems to me that no stain of guilt could be stamped upon a
                brow so fair-of one so ingen- : uous. Yet I would not have my daughter's happiness
                depend upon the guilt or innocence of a stranger." "Do not fear it, mother. Depend

                hear aunt Wilsome descending the stairs. Let her not find us discomposed." Her
                mother responded by hearty laughter. "I shall go distracted!" said Miss Wilsome, the
                recent inroads on her cheeks having been carefully repaired before the mirror in her
                chamber. "What shall we do?" "Play, of course," said Mrs. Winkle.- I'll send for
                Gusset, and we four will have a game." "Very good," cried Wilsome, "we must not
                exact too much of Mr. Lowe's time. He is a perfect gentleman, sister." "I am very
                glad you think so, Wilsome," was Mrs. Win- kle's reply, "because a great many people
                think differently. They suspect him of being an impostor, and guilty of all man- ner
                of crimes." "Sister," said Wilsome, with great energy of voice, and placing her hand
                on Mrs. Winkle's shoulder, "I am glad to hear it." "Aunt Wilsome I " exclaimed Lucy.

                lies. Do not, for the world, contra- diet any of them. Let them talk-let them hate

                visitor. But send for Gusset." Biddy was despatched on the errand, but soon returned
                alone, and with looks of wonder. I Why did she not come, Biddy?" asked Mrs. Winkle.

                mother. "Do I?" replied Lucy. "I hope I shall not be the next victim. Gusset is

                would only fret you. She does not desire the company of any one to-night, if what
                she told me be true." "What was that?" asked her aunt. "That she is to be married
                to-morrow." "Married to-morrow " said the old maid, lifting up her hands. ("And she
                hopes we will attend her wedding at the church. Mr. Amble, the minister. was
                present." "And did he hear what she said?" asked Mrs. Winkle. "He did, and did not
                seem surprised." "Then it is true," said Mrs. Winkle. "True!"r cried the old maid,
                her hands still aloft. "Who's to be the bridegroom?" "She did not say. I forgot to
                ask." "Attend the wedding! and in church! Mr. Amble will get no fifty dollars from

                learn to announce him correctly, Biddy?" "Yes, mam-and-and Sargent Blore." "I
                thought I heard his wooden leg," said Mrs. Winkle. "Tell them to come in, Biddy."
                Bill entered first, being pushed forward by the sergeant, who seemed to approach
                with hesitation and embarrassment. However, he ventured at length to stand forth,
                hat in hand, and in his full military dress, some portions of which having a slight
                resemblance to the uniform of the " old guard." And Bill, too, seemed to have been
                somewhat furbished for the occasion. His shirt collar was tolerably white, and his
                face seemed to have been washed since the adventure in the ditch. "Dizzle, what is
                your will with us?" demanded Mrs. W;inkle. "Nothing, mai," said Bill. "I only came
                'cause Sar- gent Blore wanted me as one of his guards, as he never was here by
                himself." "The brave sergeant surely is not afraid of the ladies?" said Lucy.
                "That's it!" replied Bill, with a quizzical smile, and cast- ing a side glance at
                Blore, whose solitary eye rolled and blinked in evident trepidation. "I am as bold
                as a lion to men, if you please, miss," said Blore; "but I own I am no match for the
                ladies. I can fight, but I can't talk. I can lead a charge against an iron battery,
                but I can't face a woman's tongue." "Were you ever married, sergeant?" asked Mrs.
                Winkle. i "Yes, madam. And that is the way I found out how bitter a thing it is to

                Mrs. Winkle. "That's why I'm here. He thinks pretty much as I do -but he hopes
                there's one good one in the world, and that he may have her for his share." "His old
                cook and housekeeper," said Dizzle, "are snappers." "Snappers? what are they?" asked
                Lucy, "Big-headed mud turtles that snap at every thing that comes in their way, and
                they won't let go till it thunders." "Why does not my brother-in-law discharge those
                dis. agreeable women?" asked Mrs. Winkle. "It would do no good," said Blore. The new
                ones that filled their places, as soon as they found out that he was ter- rified at
                the sound of a scolding tongue, would begin to ding at him, and keep on until they
                got him under their thumbs." "I always supposed it was his indulgent nature, and not
                dread or fear, that caused him to tolerate those impudent ser- vants," said Mrs.
                Winkle. "You were wrong, then," said Miss Wilsome, "This man is right. I was the
                only one of the family that could silence the maids. If you had endeavored to rule
                your husband by a few good tongue lashings, you would have succeeded. But you--" "I
                never desired it!" said Mrs. Winkle. "Your husband was a fortunate man. He used to
                say so. And Napoleon will never marry unless he can have some guarantee that his

                wife, Mrs. Thomas, did." My name is Thomas Blore, but they called me at that time

                the victors, j dropt the Thomas with my leg and arm, and took up my other name with
                my wooden limbs to keep from being traced by my wife, if she escaped, which I felt
                pretty certain she would do. There were a number of Thomases killed, and I hoped she
                would count me as one of 'em. I've never heard of her since, and pray heaven I may

                mother!" "Pardon, miss," said Blore, " but you might remedy that. You could marry,
                and I'm sure' your new name wouldn't be a low one - ' What do you mean, sir? - No

                only stay a month or so at the palace, and fight on our side, no doubt we might
                humble this enemy--" "No, sir. Before a week is over, the artful wretch will lead my
                brother about by a ribbon as easily as I did my moii- key by his chain. She will
                make you all slaves! Go, and prepare for the worst." * Blore and Dizzle withdrew,
                the former in great despon- dency, and both maintaining a strict silence, until they
                stood at the gate which led into Lowe's kitchen. It had been- Blore's purpose, and
                the principal object of his secret mission, in the event of hearing a favorable
                report of the temper of his lord's spouse, to pay a visit to Lowe's housekeeper,
                Mrs. Edwards, of whom he had conceived a good opinion in consequence of their
                congeniality of tastes. He had never seen her; but from the moment Dizzle divulged
                her fondness for frogs, Blore had formed a favorable estimate of her discernment.
                "Come ahead," said Dizzle, opening the gate. "Perhaps I had better retreat," said
                Blore, hesitating. "Many a poor fellow under cover of the night, marches upon a
                masked battery, and is blown to the devil. It is nobler and braver, and safer too,
                to face the enemy in the broad day- light. But do you think she'll be willing?" "I
                don't know any thing about such things," said Bill. "When I told her you would be
                hunting after her, all I saw was her face turn red as fire, and Mr. Lowe a

                bayonets and women's tongues are very different things." "And so is frog spears,"
                said Bill, lifting the latch and opening the door very cautiously. Seeing the coast
                clear they both entered, and were made comfortable by the kindly greet. ing of Patty
                O'Pan, and who assured the sergeant that Mrs. Edwards was in a very agreeable humor
                that evening, and had noaseold-edher since dinner. The sergeant, then, that his
                operations might be commenced in due form, sent Patty to her master with his
                compliments, and asking the favor to be permitted to have a short conver- sation
                with his honor, on a matter of importance. The re- quest was. immediately granted;
                and when Blore entered Lowe's library he beheld, for the first time, the object of
                his solicitation, Mrs. Edwards herself, who was dusting the books and adjusting the
                window curtains with an unsteady hand. At the name of Blore, she recollected the
                intimation that had been thrown out by Dizzle; and although there was a recur- rence
                of her resentful emotions, they seemed now to be devel- oped in a less violent form,
                and so she resolved to face the sergeant's assault, if it should be his purpose to
                commence any serious matrimonial approaches. "Sit down, sir; I am glad to see you at
                my house, ser- geant," said Lowe, after witnessing one of Blore's most cere- monious
                bows. "Thank you sir-but---" Here he was interrupted in his speech by Mrs. Edwards,
                who no sooner heard his voice, than she turned round upon him, opened her mouth, and
                uttered screams in such quick succession, and with such startling energy, that even
                her mas- ter rose up in utter astonishment, and applied his hand to his ears. *
                Blore sprang from his chair and attempted to make a pre- cipitate retreat, but he
                was met at the door by Dizzle and. Patty, and was prostrated by the collision. He
                now lay upon his back, his wooden leg pointed upward in an attitude of defence, or
                as a chval de frise to repulse an apprehended at- tack. "What does this mean?"
                demanded Lowe, when Mrs. Edwards' screams died away, and she sank fainting on a
                chair "I THE SERGEANT'S LAMENTATIONS. 83 "The she-devil aimt dead!" said Blore,

                continued Blore, "I thought all was lost, and she among the rest----" "You

                among the dead." "And that haccounts for your not being Thomas, now," said Mrs.

                illegal, you remain of course the lawful wife of the ser- geant." "Pardon, sir,"
                said the sergeant. My name is Thomas Blore, but as they called me Mr. Thomas, and
                she married me as Mr. Thomas, and was always Mrs. Thomas herself---." r You think,"
                said Lowe, smiling, she has no right to be Mrs. Blore?" A "That is the point, sir,"
                said the sergeant. "It may be decided against you," said Lowe, "if she chooses to
                claim her own." "Ave you made hany thing for yourself?" demanded the housekeeper,

                after Rose had gone. "Pretty Polly!" cried the old lady. "Wilsome! poor Jocko's

                don't want to hear any thing from you, either, Snapper." Snapper followed the cook,
                but with a triumphant smile on his lip. "Have they come down?" asked Wilsome, when
                Rose reappeared. "Iss, mam--they're in the parlor." ' Tell Walter to come here."
                "Iss, maRm." Rose returned to the parlor, and Walter soon appeared before his aunt.
                "I hope you have enjoyed yourself, Walter," said his aunt, fixing her great eyes
                upon him. "Never better in my life, aunt! The only drawhack to my happiness was the
                lamentable end of poor Jocko." "And the dread- of my vengence. Tell me truly-did he
                hang himself?" "No, aunt. Neither was he wantonly killed." Walter then related the
                manner of his death, and he was surprised to see his aunt bear the recital with so
                much resignation. Of course he was not aware that hip friend Lowe had casually
                expressed his detestation of monkeys in his aunt's hearing, and that his aunt had
                conceived a partiality for his friend. "That will do. I know the rest. Your
                companions were respectable, and I commend you for every thing but the to- bacco,

                "NNonsense, child! Here, give him this. I'll keep the poem. Go, now, and conduct

                to play. But when they take their leave, you may take yours, and for ever, Walter,
                unless you agree to cut your uncle's acquaintance." "My dear aunt, Pollen and Parke
                have already agreed to go with me to Babbleton this afternoon, and to accompany me
                to my uncle's chateau. We have been concocting an enormous budget of amusement " "If

                with you. But if you do not cut your uncle, you need not return. Still you must
                write me an account of your deviltries prac- tised on the milliner. Get Pollen to do
                it, for I intend to read it for the diversion of my friends." Walter rejoined his
                frieflds in the parlor, and conducted them to the breakfast table, where his aunt
                presided with gayety and good humor, to their great delight. After the re- past,
                they departed to make preparations for the celebration of the emperor's nuptials. It
                was not until they were traversing one of the streets where fire-works were kept for
                sale, that Walter looked at the paper his aunt had charged him to deliver to Pollen.
                It was a check for fifty dollars; and it threw the poor poet into a paroxysm of
                exultation. He would have spent half of it im- mediately, under the supposition that
                more could at any time be as easily acquired, had he not been prevented by Walter,
                who insisted upon his privilege of defraying all the expenses of the meditated

                fits of abstraction, and began unconsciously to utter words relating to a subject
                foreign to the matter under consid- eration. He was dictating proposals for the
                issue of a new periodical, of which he was to be both the proprietor and <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6922-00000051"/> 90
                THE WINKLES. editor. And he alleged in his soliloquy, that inasmuch as the critics,
                who had never ceased to do him gross injustice, were actuated by unworthy motives,
                being authors themselves, it would be his privilege and pleasure to retaliate upon
                them by an exposure of their ignorance and malevolent motives. At the same time it
                would be his delight and duty to contribute to the development of true genius
                wherever he might discover it, instead of relalsing meritorious young aspirants by
                gratui- tous sneers or disheartening them by cruel neglect. In a word, the injustice
                he had suffered, would teach him to be just. "Let him go," said young Parke, when he
                saw the poet, unmindful of his company, turn into an alley, principally oc- cupied
                by printers, and proceed on his way muttering to him- self, and gesticulating
                energetically. "Yes-let him go," said Walter. looking after him. "He would not enjoy
                the sport. But who is that over there bow- ing to you?" "It's Snobson. Don't you
                know him? he's coming towards us. He staid only two years at college, and
                leftwithout graduating. And yet his father is a rich banker. Shall I introduce him?"
                "Yes. Perhaps he'll go up with us. Is there any fun in him " "Full towthe brim-and

                himself such an irresistible Adonis, that no one is capable of withstanding him." At
                that moment Snobson came up and was introduced to Walter, who was amused at the
                scarcely perceptible mustaches which were industriously stroked by Snobson, his
                ponderous chain, his enormous ring, and his polished tight-fitting shoes. He saw,
                likewise, at a single glance, that the face of his new acquaintance was- marred by
                incurable pimples, and that his hair was fiery red. Snobson," said Parke, "d how

                "Near Babbleton." "Babbleton! Good! I'm in. I go there every day. I've made a great
                discovery up there. The most beautiful creature in the world lives in Babbleton. I

                was evidently Walter's own sister Lucy! But he manifested no surprise, promising
                himself some amusement at their meeting. -CHAPTER X. ,A GRAND PARTY AT MR. WINKLE'S
                CHATEAU. DURING the passage to Babbleton, Mr. Tom Snobson enter- tained Winkle and
                Parke with narrations of his innumerable adventures with the belles at the different
                watering-places, all of which he had visited within the last six weeks. His career
                had been an unbroken triumph. He had been cordially wel- comed by the keepers of the
                hotels, and had received only smiles from the ladies. His father was excessively
                rich, and every body knew it. But of all the young ladies it had ever been his good
                fortune to admire, the unknown beauty whom he had traced to Babbleton seemed to have
                made the deepest impression on his 'susceptible heart. He declared upon his honor,
                that he dreamt of her incessantly, and really felt that he might be capable of
                loving her dearly, and only her-pro. vided she came of a good family. He did not
                deem it neces- sary to reflect that his own father had served an apprentice- ship ih
                a counting-room, since he was now a universally ac- knowledged aristocrat. George
                Parke's curiosity became excited to behold the par- agon of Babbleton, whose charms
                Snobson delighted so much to portray; and Walter, assuming a dubious gravity, as if
                not quite sure he had ever seen the unparalleled creature, and knowing perfectly
                well that Parke had never met with Lucy, meditated only the means of realizing the
                greatest possible amount of sport from the discovery. He assured them, there- fore,
                that if it had not been his good fortune hitherto, to know so lovely an inhabitant
                of the village, there would be no diffi <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6922-00000052"/> 92 THE WINKLES. culty in
                procuring an introduction, and then his friends, and especially the enamored
                Snobson, should enjoy the delight of an immediate presentation. Arrived at the
                village inn, Walter contrived under some pretence or other to separate himself for a
                short time from his companions, and hastened to his mother's house to learn the
                exact condition of affairs. From the manner in which his aunt had spoken in
                condemnation of the alliance, it might be a matter of doubt whether his mother and
                sister, or either of them, had accompanied the bride to his uncle's mansion after
                the celebration of the nuptials at the altar. Lucy's letter had informed him of her
                intention to witness the ceremony; but nothing further in regard to her subsequent
                purposes. Walter's mother, however, related every thing that had transpired. The
                church had been thronged by spectators, whom Gusset had invited thither to witness
                her triumph. And it appeared that such a consummation of her ambitious projects had
                not been unforeseen; for she was decked in the usual habiliments of matrimony, and
                seemed to attract the ad- miration of many of her neighbors, who had not been accus-
                tomed to regard the retired milliner as worthy of any special attention. But Mrs.
                Winkle declared that the bride appre- ciated the importance of her position. She was
                not embar- rassed. There were no symptoms of delicate timidity in her carriage or
                speech. On the contrary, the expressions of her countenance were rather indicative
                of imperious feeling, and a proud consciousness of the elevated station she was
                hence- forth to assume, as the spouse of the wealthiest man in the country. On the
                other hand, her lord manifested indications of awe and terror in the novelty of his
                situation. As if he had utterly surrendered his independence in becoming a wed- ded
                man, he yielded an unhesitating obedience to whatever was signified as her will. He
                seemed, indeed, to have no will of his own. but to obey. And she, that her sway
                might not be diminished for the want of exercise, taxed her ingenuity to devise
                demands, that her power might be exhibited to the public. Although the groom,
                attended by his neighbors, had arrived on horseback, the bride was not satisfied to
                accom- pany her lord to his home in the same unostentatious man- ner. The old heavy
                coach had to be sent for. It was drawn by four horse, and driven by a servant in
                livery. She mount- THE BRIDE. 93 ed the steps with the air of a princess, amidst the
                gazes of admiring friends, and the envy of many ancient maidens who witnessed with
                dismay her sudden exaltation. The equipage halted at the widow's door, and Lucy was
                required to oc- cupy a seat beside her " new-made aunt," as the lady herself
                expressed it within the hearing of the widow. That was the substance of the
                information Walter obtained from his mother. But he learned a very large party would
                be assembled at the chateau that evening, and thither he lost no time in conducting
                his companions. They proceeded on foot, as the distance was not great, and arrived
                in front of the mansion just after the hall had been illuminated. "Now, boys," said
                Walter, "from what I could learn in ths village, the beauty we are in quest of must
                be among my uncle's-no, my aunt's-guests. But since it seems probable that I would
                have known the lady, and doubtless have been captivated by her irresistible charms,
                if there were not some impediment in the way, I think we should proceed with
                circumspection, until certain suspicions which have arisen in my mind are dispelled.
                She may be, possibly, the daughter of an honest shoemaker-- "No!" cried Snobson,
                "that would be a d-- 1 of a joke! and I almost in love with her!" "Or," continued
                Walter, "some milliner's apprentice; and, as my 'new-made aunt,' was once a milliner
                herself-" "That is the reason she was invited," said Parke. "But if she is as
                beautiful as Tom says, I want a chat with her, no matter who she is." * "Of course,"
                responded Walter. But then, let me uge you not to cast too many curious looks at her
                if she changes/y to appear before us unexpectedly, and should equal or surpas Tom's
                description. And above all, do not for the world ask any one who she is, or what is
                her name. It might cause you to be sneered at by some of the ton. Leave every thing
                to me. I will find a proper time and opportunity to introduce you." They entered the
                hall just when the last word was uttered; and Walter, under the pretext of seeking
                information where his uncle and aunt were to be found, left his companions for a few
                moments to themselves, promising to return immediately <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6922-00000053"/> " THE WINKLES and
                conduct them into the presence of the lord and lady of the palace. When Walter
                passed out of the great hall, the first person he met was Lucy, who, in high spirits
                threw her arms round his neck before he had recognized her. "O ho," cried he,
                "suppose it had been Snobson or Parke." "Who are they?" demanded Lucy. Walter told
                her, and she instantly promised to co-operate with him in his innocent project for
                their mutual diversion. It was arranged that they should all sit on the same side of
                the table at dinner, so that Lucy's identification by Snob- son might be delayed.
                She might, in the meantime, however, for the especial gratification of her own
                curiosity, and for the purpose of knowing the gentleman, once flit across their
                vision as they stood in the hall, and while Walter sought his uncle and aunt in the
                next room, and obtained permission to present his friends. This was speedily
                accomplished; and when Walter re- entered the hall to conduct the young gentlemen
                into the presence of the married couple, he found them transported with the
                lingering effects of the bright vision which had been vouchsafed them. "Was she the
                beauty you saw on the boat and followed into - street?" asked Walter. "Yes," cried
                Snobson, " only more angelic than ever. I hope she is no mechanic's daughter, no
                milliner's apprentice. I care not how poor she may be--my father is rich enough- I
                will marry her. George, recollect, I am in love, honorably in love I And you,
                Winkle, I warn you to keep your eyes off -she was discovered by me, and should be
                mine." "Warning me against gazing at one whom I don't know! You need not fear. All I
                apprehend is that she will turn out one of the nobodies you despise so much. But,
                come; it is the hour for dinner, and you must be presented." Walter led them into
                the presence of the host and hostess, where they were very cordially received.
                "Taken at last, uncle? I hope you will be happy in your captivity," said Walter.
                "Not taken, sir-no capitulation, sir-but a convention- an alliance-with secret
                stipulations. In the domestic de partment my ally will rule, whilst I direct the
                military and diplomatic affairs." THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY. 95 "I forget, Mr. Winkle,"
                said his imperious spouse-for she seemed to become more haughty at every new
                develop. ment of her newly acquired power and importance--" whether or not the
                secret stipulations were to be divulged by either of us." "Oh, I beg pardon, my dear
                Gusset." "Recollect!" cried she, in his ear, " you were never to men- tion that name
                again." "True-true. You must not hesitate to remind me of any neglect of duties,
                Mrs. Winkle, or infraction of the treaty. But as for secret stipulations--" Here
                dinner was announced, and the emperor's speech was cut short. He conducted his
                spouse in advance of the company, and a chair was reserved near them at the table
                for Lucy, who, in pursuance of the plan agreed upon, remained in concealment until
                all the guests were seated. But that his companions might not be idle, Walter intro-
                duced them to a great many of his acquaintances, and among the rest, to the sisters
                Bell and :Blanche Arum, rich and fashionable daughters of a retired patent pill
                manufacturer, which was quite a different personage from the manufacturer of shoes;
                to the sisters Susan and Sally Crudle, whose father was still more wealthy than the
                haughty Arum: but then he made his fortune by the manufacture of beer. Arum had long
                since sunk the shop, while Crudle could not be prevailed on to relinquish his
                business. Therefore his. name was still over the door of the shop in the city; and
                while it remained. there, Mrs. C. opposed every attempt of her daughters to prevail
                on their coachman to wear a broad band on his hat and extra bright buttons on his
                coat. Orudle listened very patiently to every argument advanced, both by his wife
                and daughters, in favor of an entire relinquishment of business: the demonstra-
                tions of a sufficiency of wealth to produce an ample income at simple interest; the
                delights of leisure: the advantages of dignified retirement, and the better
                opportunity of effecting advantageous alliances, etc. To all such protestations and
                pleadings, Mr. Crudle would reply, by casting a check for $1000 into the midst of
                his family, for the purchase of new articles of furniture, jewels, etc, and alleging
                that quadruple that amount had been realized from his business since the last
                discussion of the subject, and that if he had taken their advice, he would have been
                a poorer man by so many thousands. - Lucy had glided into the saloon, and quietly
                taken posses- <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6922-00000054"/> 96 THE WINIKLES. sion of the chair which had been reserved for
                her; the clatter of knives and forks having overwhelmed all other sounds. The young
                gentlemen had sipped their wine with the bride, with their eyes glancing from the
                Arums to the Crudles, who sent back flashes of equal intensity; and all the time
                Lucy sat demurely at the side of her protuberant uncle, slyly ex- changing signals
                with her brother, who was nearly opposite his companions, and occasionally obtaining
                a stealthy view of Snob- son and Parke who were incessantly addressed by the Crudles
                and Arums across the table. Nor was it long before the enterprising daughters of the
                rich men learned that Tom Snobson was the son of the great banker Snobson, whose
                position in society was fixed, and whose name had been in the newspapers. Nor was it
                less interesting to ascertain-which they did-that young Parke was a stu- dent at
                Princeton College, destined to the legal profession, and a scion of one of the great
                southern families, who pos- sessed their hundreds of slaves. True, slavery in the
                abstract was condemned-but in the hymenial concrete, it might not be an
                irreconcilable evil. Hence, a battery was unmasked against both young gentlemen,
                from the flashing eyes of the daughters of the pill and beer nabobs. Far away at the
                opposite end of the table sat Ralph Ro- lan4, never gazing towards Lucy but between
                his fingers, and unperceived by her. Edmund Lowe, pale, thoughtful and abstemious,
                was not so far removed, nor so careful in conceal- ing the direction of his eyes,
                which wandered over the whole assembly, and dwelt thq longest upon the fair brow and
                per- feet form of Lucy. He sat beside old John Dowly-the melancholy discarded lover
                of Lucy's mother. After the last course had disappeared, Roland arose with a foaming
                goblet and proposed the health of the bride, which was loudly cheered and heartily
                responded to by all but Lucy, who wa&amp; glancing slyly at Walter's excited
                friends, whose heads were dodging under the artillery of Blanche and Bell, and Susan
                and Sally. "Be attentive, Lucy!" said her aunt. "Did you not hear what Mr. Roland
                said?" "I beg pardon, Gusset," replied Lucy, quickly, resuming her former attitude,
                but not before Snobson had perceived her. "Miss Winkle!" said Griselda, "I beg that
                you will NAPOLEON CONQUERED. 97 hereafter forget that I was ever called Gusset. That
                name has been extinguished, and I shall expect none but my enemies to make use of it
                hereafter." "She is now my spouse, and your aunt, Lucy," said Mr. Winkle. I forgot,
                uncle." I know it. Of course you could never be the enemy of my wife-although she
                says some of my family will never treat her with respect." Lucy was silent, while
                her aunt looked steadily at her. Then Colonel Oakdale proposed three cheers for
                Napoleon Winkle; and amidst the rapturous applause-for the coloiel, being a widower
                himself, and the junior of the bridegroom, had intimated his purpose of following
                Napoleon's example- there was heard a startling crash about midway down the table,
                which was followed by slight shrieks from the Arums and Cradles. It had been
                occasioned by thi fall of Snobson, who, in leaning back to obtain another view of
                the glorious eyes of Lucy that had been momentarily fixed upon him, lost his
                equilibrium, and fell over on his back. This incident was followed by uncontrollable
                laughter, on the part of Walter, who understood the cause of it, and which was
                signalled by him to Lucy, whose ill suppressed convul- sions gave her aunt serious
                vexation, and subjected herself to several terse lectures upon the subject of
                propriety. The scene had not escaped the notice of Roland, whose brows were
                contracted fiercely, as he endeavored in vain to catch the eye of the offending
                young gentleman. The glance he launched at' Lucy, was repulsed with something like
                dis- dain, certainly with indifference. Without form or ceremony,-for Napoleon had
                most unac- countably-abandoned the helm of command, and his spouse had never before
                mingled with, much less been a principal actor in so large an assembly of gay
                people, the company arose and proceeded to the parlors in promiscuous groups, with
                no regard to precedence, and much to the chagrin of the Arums, who vented their
                spleen openly. But it afforded delight to the Crudles, who appreciated the utmost
                freedom of social enjoyment. Walter lingered in the hall to intercept his
                companions, where, upon meeting him, they contrived to escape from their belles. 5

                perturbation. "They drew me over. The chair-back was broken off, and that made the
                crash. It was magnetism. She attracted me. You could see her, Winkle, from where you

                She'll turn out a nobody I'm afraid." "If she is the one I saw flit across the
                hall," said Parke, "you may rely upon it Tom has reason for his madness. Mil-
                liner's apprentice or not, she has the most fascinating features and carriage of any
                girl in the company, if not in the uni. verse." "You, too! I'm sorry I brought you
                here. Your parents will never forgive me. In love with some poor obscure village
                girl, whose fingers may be pricked into nutmeg graters by the point of her needle!
                You had the aristocracy by you. The Arums and the Crudles." We learned they were
                rich in a few minutes," said Parke; "for they spoke unconsciously of their fathers'
                houses and lots, horses and carriages, and their fine dresses and jewelry-and the
                sums that had been paid for them. We'learned every thing but the manner in which
                their fortunes had been made." "And they were au fait as to the standing and means
                of my family-and of yours, Winkle," he added, rather gravely. But not of mine," said
                Parke. "They could not find out how many acres and woolly heads I had. Yet they
                seemed disposed to take me on trust. And perhaps one of them, the younger
                Crudle-Sally, I believe-may have a chance for me. My income they tell me is to be
                small, whenever the cotton crop fails. A mile square in Georgia, don't produce as
                much revenue as a lot in the city of twenty-five feet front. I shall not lose sight
                of the Crudles, for they are capable of refine- ment, and our people in the South
                won't be too inquisitive if I bring home an heiress." When the young gentlemen
                entered the parlors, the first object that attracted the attention of Snobson, 4was
                Lucy. She sat in an alcove of a window, conversing with Lowe. Old Mr. Dowly was
                seated apart, with his large lustrous eyes MR. SNOBSON INTRODUCED. 99 fixed upon the
                interesting pair. Roland was talking to Miss Bell Arum, while Blanche was looking
                over the music at the piano. The Crudles, contriving to be disengaged, seemed to be
                awaiting the approach of our party of young gallants. At the extreme end of the long
                apartment, on a luxuriously cush- ioned sofa, were seated Mr. and Mrs. Winkle,
                receiving the felicitations of their acquaintance. "There she is!" whispered
                Snobson. "Is she not an angel?" "She surpasses all the beauties I ever beheld," said
                Parke. Oh, that lady in the recess, conversing with Mr. Lowe?" responded Walter.
                "Yes!" said Parke, with animation. "But if the fel- low's name be Lowe, he does not
                seem to be a low fellow. I noticed him at the table, and I think I never beheld a
                gentle- man of better polish or more refined manners. He has a fine countenance, and
                the young lady must be of high breeding. Walter, none of your humbug! I suspect she
                is one of your favorites. You seem to have them every where. I shall know what to
                say to Miss Virginia, when I return to the city." "You are mistaken, George; upon my
                honor you are. if you suppose I have matrimonial designs upon that creature. I know
                her well. You shall be introduced. Come along." "But who is she? her name?" demanded
                the young men. a Oh, Miss what-do-you-call-her! Come!" he continued, leading them
                towards the alcove, seeing Lowe withdraw with a smile on his beautiful pale lip, and
                convincedthat Lucy had revealed to him the mischievous plot. "But if she should not
                be a proper acquaintance for me to make in such a public place?" said Snobson,
                hesitatingly. "Oh, come along. She is quite genteel enough. Sister Lucy," he
                continued, with gravity, "let me introduce my friends, Mr. Snobson, of Philadelphia,
                and Mr. Parke, of Georgia." Lucy bowed very kindly, while the young gentlemen
                blundered in their salutations, and knew not what to say. They looked at each other,
                at Walter, at Miss Winkle, blushed and trembled. They might have felt and acted
                differently, if it had occurred to them that Walter had delib- erately meditated so
                embarrassing a surprise for them. "I think I have enjoyed the pleasure of seeing Mr.
                Snob- son before," said Lucy; "and I do not remember where. <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6922-00000056"/> 100 THE WINKLES.
                And yet I am sure it has not been very long since. Oh I did I not see you on the
                boat the other day?" Snobson was under the necessity of confessing that he was on
                the boat the day'alluded to, for had he not told Wal- ter that he followed the
                charming creature through several streets? But the poor fellow was so nearly
                stricken dumb that he could only utter monosyllables. "And I have often heard my
                brother speak with enthusi- asm of his friend from Georgia. Perhaps Mr. Parke may
                have detected Walter in some insidious praise of his poor sister?" "No-hang me if
                ever he did!" said Walter. "True," said Parke, recovering his accustomed compo-
                sure, "but I wonder he did not. I am sure I would have lauded one of mine to him if
                he had dwelt so near her, pro. vided she had been so-IT mean fair, and
                accomplished." "That would have been a different matter altogether," said Walter.
                "And no doubt I should have mentioned Lucy, if-don't frown, sister!" "Go, sir. I
                dismiss you," said Lucy, affecting a look of displeasure. "I will, good sister,"
                said Walter; "for I see Sergeant Blore beckoning me through the window. But, Lucy,
                where are the guards? I see no bayonets." "Or aunt has ordered them not to appear
                to-night. "She is to be general, then? We'll see. Don't be alarmed at? any thing you
                hear to-night, Lucy." Saying this, Walter withdrew. He was followed by Snobson, and
                overtaken on the terrace. "Mr. Winkle," said Snobson, "I want to make you an humble
                apology; and I hope you won't be offended after- wards. I do beg your pardon. I
                didn't know it was your sister I was talking about, and was following in the street.
                I am willing to make any reparation in my power-- "Reparation?" "Upon my honor I
                will! I am sure, if father could once see her-" "You would marry her, if he gave his
                consent? "Upon my word and honor I would! And you may say so to her, if you
                choose---" "Oh, my dear fellow, you must say such things to her yourself. And as for
                apologizing for what you did the other A COMPLETE CHANGE. 101 day, I beg you won't
                think of it. It is gratifying to any girl to be admired and followed. You have no
                idea what fine spirits my sister enjoyed when she observed it." "Did she seeme?"
                "Yes-and she boasted of it. The girls are as fond of making conquests as ever
                Alexander was." "And she knew it! I feel like a detected sheep-killing dog! What
                shall I do?" "Why, tell her she carried your heart by storm; that the attraction was
                too powerful to be resisted; and hence you i could not avoid following her. She will
                be flattered, I assure you." "I shall never have the boldness to speak to her in
                that way. But you will not be offended, I hope?" ' Nonsense, Tom. I would do the
                same if I were like you, no doubt. But excuse me, now; I have an appointment out
                here under the chestnut tree." Snobson returned to the gay company within, while
                Walter joined the sergeant, with whom he found Bill Dizzle, and both were anxiously
                awaiting him. The new mistress of the establishment had truly exerted her power over
                her lord, and obtained an order that there should be no military display in the
                vicinity of the mansion. But the retainers of the house had permission to get drunk
                at the barracks, called the camp of Bologne, near the scene of the late invasion of
                John Bull, and to send up a few noise. less rockets in honor of the merry occasion.
                The subject of the conference under the chestnut tree on the lawn, may be developed
                in the progress of this history. Suffice it to say, that the sergeant wag much
                chagrined at the conduct of his general's spouse; and was conscious of well founded
                appre- hensions, that she was not only capable of subduing all the other females
                about the house, but would not. be likely to pause in the career of ambition, until
                she had obtained the supreme command of the entire establishment. At all events he
                was quite as impatient as Walter could be, to ascertain by some well-conceived
                experiments the extent of her influence over her lord. <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6922-00000057"/> 102 THE WINKLES.
                CHAPTER XI THE BRIDAL NIGHT CONTINUED, AND WHAT TOOK PLACE ON THE TOP OF THE HOUSE.
                As there are more vicissitudes in American society than in any other under the sun,
                it follows that our people are the most observant and calculating of the dwellers
                upon this mun- dane sphere. Therefore, as soon as the revellers were re-as- sembled
                in the commodious parlors of the Winkle mansion, and those who fancied that sort of
                exercise, were tripping on the " light fantastic toe," the other portion of the
                assembly, that preferred the exercise of the tongue, were every where discussing the
                consequences of the wedding. "I am sorry for the widow, and it's a pity for Walter
                and Lucy," said Mrs. Arum, as she admired a heavy jewel, re- sembling a fantastic
                breastplate, on the bosom of her daugh- ter Bell. "It's tremendous lamentable,"
                responded Mrs. Crudle, smiling at her daughter Susan, then whirling in the dance
                with Mr. Roland, " to- think that they held their heads so high! * ow, Mr. Roland
                says, they are beggars!" "Beggars, Mrs. Crudle surely they'll not be so bad off as
                that?" "That's what he said-but I wouldn't have it mentioned for the world as coming
                through me. He says Miss Wilsome went off in a huff to the city, swearing vengeance
                against. all the family that countenanced the hypocritical Gusset, and de- claring
                she would have nothing further to do with any of 'em who went to the wedding, or
                attended the revels out here to- night." "And Wilsome is wilful enough to keep her
                word. Lucy and Walter were looked upon as her heirs." "She'll marry now, if it's to
                a butcher; that is, if he can learn to play whist. It's in the breed. You see what
                her hallucinated brother has done. I'm sure a fair-faced well- formed butcher is as
                good as the scrawny sallow-complexioned milliner." "You are right, Mrs. Crudle. And
                as we were just say- COOL IMPUDENCE. * 103 ing, our haughty neighbors, the Winkles
                of Babbleton; must lower their feathers at least, for the humble demure Gusset that
                was, and that used to knuckle to and almost worship them, as sure as she lives, will
                be revenged. She will tower above them now. I know the nature of these soft-spoken ;
                meek old maids when they get the upper hand! They'll quarrel the first week. I know
                it. And the proud widow would die rather than demean herself before her old de-
                pendant." "Yes, indeed, Mrs. Arum! And she will be willing to associate oftener with
                other people who are worth a thousand times as much as herself-and in place of
                smiling risively when pertinent people must be telling how our husbands made their
                fortunes, she'll be sending the silly Biddy to us for the loan of a gill of cream,
                or a basket of coals. Oh, we'll mor- tify 'em! Let's make our coachmen drive by her
                house six times every fine day; and tell the girls to promenade before her doors in
                their richest and newest dresses. It's a duty to humble any one's pride, who hasn't
                got money to support it." "Bell! come dance with me!" cried Walter, abruptly
                appearing- before the daughter, who was listening in silence. The matrons stared;
                but before they could recover their pre- sence of mind to deprecate what would have
                been deemed by either of them two days before a great honor, Bell had eager- ly and
                precipitately accepted the invitation. "Did you ever see such cool impudence!" said
                Mrs. Crudle. "But Bell bounced up like a hare from under a cabbage leaf. She's been
                used to thinking it a great honor to be noticed by a Winkle." "I'll learn her
                better. But, then, Walter isn't to blame. Nor Lucy, either. If they behave
                themselves, and never put on airs, we needn't shut our doors in their faces. Poor
                Lucy I yonder she sits alone, no doubt thinking on her destitute situ- ation. I
                wonder Roland, who has been whirling with Susan, don't ask her to dance. And the
                mysterious stranger, who will not even speak to any other girl, is stalking
                backwards and forwards in the hall." "Yes, I saw him there. His arms were folded,
                and he was in a deep distraction." "Abstraction, Mrs. Crudle." "It's all one. Both
                of my girls have got fine partners. Snobson's family, you know, are invited to

                they all belong to the very first families. They don't need certifications of
                character." / Poor Lucy! She seemed truly to be deserted by her ac- customed
                worshippers. She sat alone in the recess, gazing mournfully at the merry scene. She
                had overheard more than One of her own sex speculating upon the results of her
                uncle's marriage, and the indignant abandonment of her aunt; and she could easily
                perceive, by the glances of triumph among those who had often envied her, that her
                reverse of fortune was to be for them a matter of exultation, rather than one of
                sympathy. She was neglected by her new aunt, and for- gotten by her uncle. Her
                brother's young friends were flirt- ing with the Arums and the Crudles. Lowe, with
                folded arms, was immersed in one of his reveries, finding a solitude in a crowd. And
                as if to confirm her melancholy, she' had been again annoyed by the importunity of
                Roland, who, after keeping aloof for several hours, had seized an opportunity to
                repeat his dEclaration, and to urge his suit by all the induce- ments which the
                desire of possessing fortune might naturally suggest. He did not venture to depict
                directly the destitute condition of Lucy, but he knew it would be sufficiently appa-
                rent to one of her vivid imagination, when contrasted with the vast possessions
                which he offered to share with her. And to add to her vexation, she beheld the eyes
                of Lowe at last riveted upon her when Roland was urgently pressing his suit! She was
                immovable, and her persecutor, without extorting a peremptory refusal, departed
                sullenly, and was soon laughing very heartily with Blanche Arum. An intermission
                occurred, during which the band of musi- cians withdrew to partake of their
                accustomed and indispen- sable stimulants. It was then proposed by the artful
                mothers of the Arum and Crudle belles, that there should be music at the piano; and
                above the noise and confusion of conversa- tion and laughter, the ringing voices of
                the heiresses pene- trated the ears of all. And at the end of every performance
                there was a loud clapping of hands, followed by a simultane- ous volley of
                compliments. It was during one of the pauses which succeeded these storms of
                plaudits, that the loud and hearty voice of Col. Oakdale was heard calling for Lucy.
                "Where is she? where is she?" he asked, making his way THE EFFECT OF MUSIC. 105
                through the company. "I must hear her voice, or shall never be able to sleep again.
                Come forth, I say, Lucy Winkle! Oh, there you are! My deaP, sweet girl," he con-
                tinued, advancing to the alcove which Lucy had never quitted, and where Lowe was now
                sitting beside her, " do have mercy on my poor old widowed ears, and regale them
                with one of the songs of other days, such as you and my Virginia know so well how to
                sing. Come Lowe, bring her along." The colonel opened a passage, and Lucy suffered
                Lowe to conduct her to the piano. She sat down before the instrument, without
                seeming to be conscious of the multitude of glances directed towards her. She was
                calm and pensive. Turning over the leaves, she selected a song congenial to her
                feelings. The words had been written by one of the great poets of a preceding
                generation, and expressed the tumultuous emotions and affection of an innocent heart
                wounded by one who had been the victim of a wicked deception. -So electric is deep
                human feeling, that every one coming in contact with it par- takes of its nature and
                influence. The first notes of the in- strument under the gentle touch of her rosy
                fingers, imparted a thrill of softened sadness to every person that heard them. And
                when the sound of her exquisitely modulated voice suc- ceeded, conveying the full
                inspiration of the poet, by the pro- per emphasis, the expression, the gestures-the
                spell of enchantment was complete, and not the slightest whisper could be heard in
                that vast assembly. And when the last word was uttered by the fair songstress, and
                her ivory arm .reclined motionless on the keys, and her bosom rose and fell like the
                billows of the ocean after the cessation of a storm, a pro- tracted silence ensued.
                The colonel stood on one side with folded arms, his chin sunk upon his breast. Lowe,
                pale, listless, and immobile as a statue, was on the other. The first movement was
                made by Walter, who stepped forward, and encircling the neck of his sister, bestowed
                a kiss upon her snowy forehead. "I will do that too!" exclaimed the bridegroom,
                rising spasmodically from the sofa where his spouse had hitherto confined him. "She
                is of my own flesh and blood, and I am proud of her." But before he could exebute
                his purpose, he was overtaken by his wife, who whispered a few magical words ,in his
                ear which induced him to resume his seat. Lowe conducted Lucy back to the dim recess

                moonlight, while the sad girl, reclining her chin upon her hand, gazed after him
                through the glass door that opened upon the terrace. But she had not long maintained
                that pensive attitude, before she was startled by the presence of one, who had never
                hitherto ventured to address her except in answer to some interrogatory relating to
                his duties behind the counter. This was Mr. Blot- ter, the clerk of Fibber, a
                shopkeeper in the village. "Don't be down-hearted, miss," said he, "for every body
                who has a heart, can't help feeling for you." "Feeling for me, sir?" exclaimed Lucy,
                in utter astonish. ment. Yes, miss. Every body is saying that your mother will be
                poor, now; and Mr. Fibber, my employer, who trusted Miss Gusset on your mother's
                recommendation, has ordered me not to run up a long account this year with the
                widow---" "I don't understand this, sir. Pray excuse me," said Lucy. "It means that
                Mr. Fibber is no gentleman, and next year, when my time is up with him, and I get my
                little money from my guardian, I mean to tell him so, if you will give me liberty."
                "What do you desire of me?" asked Lucy turning her eyes full upon the young man.
                "All I want to say is your singing made the tears come into my eyes, and I feel as
                if I could die to do you any good. And if all the world deserts you, Miss Lucy,
                remember that I, Dick Blotter, am your friend till death. I would marry you in a
                minute!" Before Lucy could utter a word in response to such an unlooked-for
                declaration, the shopkeeper's clerk had vanished. She buried her face in her
                handkerchief, and her whole frame was seized with convulsive agitations. Lowe, who
                witnessed the scene from his position without, had returned, and was now standing
                beside her. "Lucy,:' said he, " who has offended you?" ' Offended me?" she asked,
                raising her face, bedewed with tears, and exhibiting the traces-not of
                displeasure-but of excessive laughter! I see I was mistaken," said Lowe, turning
                away, as if to retire. "Hear what it was," said ZJucy. She then recapitulated ORDERS
                COUNTERMANDED. 107 what had been communicated by poor Blotter, and Lowe could not
                repress the smile which struggled to relax his features. "But, Lucy," said he,
                sighing, and occupying a seat at her side, which served to shield her from the
                prying glances of the flitting company, "the things which poor Blotter has revealed
                to you are freely discussed by the guests of your new aunt. -One cannot avoid
                hearing them, let him turn whithersoever he will." "I am aware of it," said Lucy.
                "Then why not escape such annoyances?" "How can I escape them? But they shall not
                annoy me. " "How? I have told you. Promise--" "Edmund-I can promise no more! I have,
                perhaps, already pledged too much. You have every information that can be desired in
                regard to my family-to my condition and prospects. Then why do you withhold from my
                mother the communication which you say must prove satisfactory? I will make no
                further confession. I am pledged never to be involved in any irrevocable
                entanglement of the heart without her concurrence. My word to her shall be held
                inviolably sacred. Proceed no farther-cease to refer to the subject- unless you are
                prepared to satisfy my mother." "Do you doubt, Lucy?" "I do not! Let that suffice.
                Urge me no further. My duty must be performed-shall be performed-even if I sur- vive
                it not." "Lucy! I love you beyond all human power of expression! and I never loved
                another! But why repeat what I have so often declared already. Would to heaven I
                were richer. But I have a sufficient income for happiness in a village ---" "Pray do
                not speak thus, Mr. Lowe. Your thoughts seem be uttered unconsciously, and you may
                be heard by others." "True. Forgive me. My life of solitude has engendered the
                habit. But, believe me, Lucy, whatever others may sup- pose, I have no thoughts
                which might not be uttered within the hearing of any one as gentle and pure in heart
                as your- self." At this juncture Bill Dizzle, decked in his Sunday clothes, glided
                through one of the long folding glass doors that opened on the terrace, and made his
                way expeditiously to the . .' <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6922-00000060"/> 108 THE WINKLES. sofa on which the lord of
                the establishment was sitting. He placed a short despatch in his hand, and then
                stood apart as if awaiting his orders. "To arms! To arms!" shouted the aroused
                Napoleon. "We are invaded! The enemy are upon us! Let the drums beat-mount
                horses-sound the bugle, and away!" Stop! Bill Dizzle!" cried the now imperious Mrs.
                Na- poleon Winkle, seizing the messenger with one hand, and snatching the despatch
                away from her lord with the other. "Don't be frightened, my friends," continued she;
                "it is a false alarm, and intended as a joke; I'llread the intelligence. 'The red
                boar has thrown down the palings and led the whole drove into the garden.' Bill,"
                said she, amidst the shouts of laughter that ensued, " whistle up the dogs and drive
                the pigs out of the garden." Napoleon sank back subdued on the sofa. "You know, Mr.
                Winkle," said his spouse, perceiving his humiliation, " it was stipulated that I
                should direct the little domestic matters which occur about the- house. If you had
                been in the field, this affair would have fallen under your ju- risdiction." "Oh,
                madam, if it be really a false alarm, every one will be indebted to you for so
                prompt and complete a suppression of it; and I shall have cause to congratulate
                myself on finding in my spouse so valuable an auxiliary. No doubt when I am called
                to the distant north, you will make an efficient regent." "Yes. I'll undertake to
                govern in your absence. But, you know, it is all a joke. The silly people pretend to
                say that you really believe the bulls are the British, the hogs the Russians, and
                yourself the great Corsican chieftain. It is not so-is it Tell me it was all for
                your amusement! Tell me so on this, your wedding night!" "Of course, my dear, I
                never supposed such things to be really as I called them, or as they may have been
                represented by others. But every one has some hobby or other, and I have mine. I
                sometimes become excited to such a degree that, no doubt, I am capable of imagining
                any thing. And that is my felicity, which I should be sorry to have destroyed. In
                childhood our toy horses, and men and beasts, are real flesh and blood in our
                estimation. In age, we are only chil- dren of a larger growth, and as long as our
                infatuations do not injure others, I think they might be regarded as allowable
                ANOTHER DESPATCH. 109 and justifiable. One of the good effects, my dear, of the hal-
                lucination attributed to me, was the accidental discovery of one I deemed capable of
                sympathy and disposed to defend my innocent motives whenever they might be assailed.
                I need not name her." "I will defend you-you may rely upon it," said his spouse,
                with some misgivings as to the extent she might pro- ceed with safety in taking
                possession of the reins. It flashed upon her understanding, that in the event of a
                rupture, she might possibly be expelled from her magnificent home, and therefore it
                might be prudent to infuse a particle more of con- ciliation in her preliminary
                measures. There were many methods of reducing husbands to subjection: but if all of
                them should fail, there could be no foe sufficiently potential to take from her the
                respectable name of Winkle, and of confer. ring the odious one of Gusset upon her
                again. The meditations of the aspiring bride were put to flight by a sudden flash,
                more vivid than the light of the wax candles, and which was succeeded by a
                tremendous explosion of artil- lery. A great many slight screams were heard-the
                dancers paused in mid career, and the musicians let fall their instru- ments. The
                bride sprang up, pale, and quivering with vexa- tion. "Oh, Mr. Winkle!" said she,
                "you promised there should be none of this." "I did, indeed, my dear-and I am one
                who- keeps his word. I must know the meaning of it. Blore shall be called to an
                account. Unless he can show that it is one of the anni- versaries we have been in
                the habit of--" "Oh, if you can excuse him on such a pretext as that, he will not be
                punished; for I have heard it said that Bona- parte fought bloody battles on every
                day of the summer months." "And if he fought, of course he won," replied Napoleon
                Winkle. Bill Dizzle glided in and placed another despatch in the hand of Napoleon.
                Dizzle," said Mrs. Winkle reproachfully, i' I told you to bring no more papers here
                to night." "How can I help it, mam? They'd shoot me if I didn't obey orders." "It,
                was a mistake," said Mr. Winkle. "Sergeant Blore, <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6922-00000061"/> "O THE WINKLES. you know, has
                only one eye, and he says the calendar was blotted. He begs pardon. It is granted.
                The great battle was not fought on this day-neither did it result in such a manner
                as to call for commemoration. Yet I forgive him." "What great battle?" asked
                several. "Waterloo! And the sergeant must have been indulging excessively in strong
                potations, to forget how that struggle terminated, since he lost two of his limbs
                and an eye on the occasion. But he writes me the cause of the apparent loud- ness of
                the report was the pointing of the guns in this direc- tion." "Are they aiming the
                cannons at us?" asked Mrs. Crudle, in great alarm. 4' There were no balls in them,
                madam. They fire blank cartridges on such occasions." "' Walter," said Mrs. Winkle,
                "won't you oblige me by re- questing the sergeant to commit no more such mistakes
                to- night?" "With pleasure," responded the young gentleman, who was happy to have an
                excuse for being absent. And in truth the discharge of the guns had been in
                pursuance of his instruc- tions. Towards midnight the guests dispersed totheir
                respective homes, the Arumg and Crudles inviting Parke and Snobson into their
                coaches. Lucy was despatched in Mr. Roland's carriage, which her new aunt had
                procured for that purpose, as her own was too heavy to be driven quickly, and she
                had promised her sister to send Lucy home that night. Old John Dowly and Edmund Lowe
                were the last to de- part; the one in his old-fashioned gig, and the other on foot,
                he being a famous walker. Then the house was carefully closed under the directions
                of Mrs. Griselda Winkle, who now assumed the reins in earn- est, and informed the
                domestics, male and female, and parti- cularly the latter, and in the presence of
                her assenting lord, that every command she issued was to be implicitly obeyed. The
                housekeeper and the cook looked rebellion, but made no opposition. They knew that
                Griselda was not an inexperi- enced timid miss, for she had long kept a house of her
                own, and was familiar with the use of bolts and bars. And when the doors were made
                fast, she undertook to allot apartments A NIGHT ADVENTURE. 1" for the various
                lodgers, having a most extraordinarily accurate comprehension of the plan and
                capacity of the fine old man- sion. The females were sent to the most distant
                chambers, while Walter's apartment on the second floor was only sepa- rated from her
                own by the corridor that ran between. The doors were opposite. Sergeant Blore
                occupied a small room at the head of the stairs, communicating with Walter's by a
                door in the thin partition. He had long occupied this room, as it was convenient to
                his chief, and Mr. Winkle had inti- mated a desire that he should continue to sleep
                there. Finally the key was turned in the door opposite to Wal- ter's, and all was
                still. Not even a retiring step was heard. The only sound that arose on the ear was
                tlfe ticking of the great high clock in the hall below, which seemed to be more
                distinctly heard at every successive swing of the pendulum. Walter, after lying
                awake some fifteen minutes, arose softly, opened his door, and descended the
                stairway in his stocking feet. He proceeded to the rear door of the hall, which he
                opened noiselessly. He then beckoned his confederates under the spreading chestnut
                tree. Bill Dizzle came first, and was followed by a dozen others, bearing muskets,
                whose burnished barrels glittered in the moonlight. But not a footfall was heard.
                All had divested themselves of their shoes. The door was carefully fastened after
                them, and they proceeded in single file up the great stairway, stepping softly after
                their leader. When turning at the head of the first flight, the rays of the moon
                streaming through the broad crescent-shaped window fell upon them, giving them the
                appearance of a spectral pla- toon traversing some haunted castle. Something
                resemmbling a superstitious awe was felt by Walter as he paused and looked down upon
                the silent party. He was not, however, to be de- i terred by any such consideration;
                and continued to ascend until he reached the narrow door leading out upon the roof.
                This was raised without difficulty, and the whole party emerged again into the open
                air. The roof was nearly flat, and the eaves were surmounted by a balustrade, which
                gave the building a castellated aspect when viewed from a distance. Walter posted
                his men in a line directly over the chamber occupied by his uncle and aunt, and made
                them all sit down. He then suspended a cord from the roof over the window of his own
                room, the upper end being attached to Dizzle's wrist. By !. <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6922-00000062"/> "2 THE WINKLES.
                this means signals were to be given. Walter then hastened back to his room and
                secured the lower end of the cord. Af ter the completion of these preparations, he
                opened the door in the partition, and reported every thing to the old sergeant, who
                had impatiently awaited -him, with his great eye blinking in the mootlight. It had
                been with difficulty that Walter prevented the old mutilated warrior from leading
                the party in person. It was obvious that his wooden leg not only rendered him
                incapable of scaling walls, but made it impossible for him to advance or retire
                without producing sounds incompatible with any plan of secrecy. "Have they wooden
                rammers?" asked Blore. "Yes." "And their breeches padded?" Yes." And instructions
                not to let any burning wads fall before the windows in front?" "Every thing has been
                done as you directed." "Then creep out and listen if your uncle is asleep. If he
                sleeps, he snores. He always does." "I heard him snoring before I came to you."
                "Very well, give the signal, and then jump into your bed. But don't you snore. They
                might suspect something." Walter pulled the string. The next moment the twelve
                muskets were fired in admirable order. making but a single re- port, and that a
                terrific one, the echoes and reverberations of which could be heard for many moments
                afterwards among the distant hills. "Ha-ah I wa-ah!" screamed Griselda, whose lids
                had not yet been visited by slumber, in consequence of the distressing nasal sounds
                so impolitely vented by her lord. But when the appalling -report overhead rent her
                tympanums, she sprang up and screamed with a desperate violence, sufficient almost
                to awaken the dead. "Bless me! what's all this?" asked Mr. Winkle, starting up. '
                Oh! they're shooting all round the house! Faugh! I'm suffocated with the smoke!"It
                being warm, the upper sashes of the windows had been lowered to admit the fresh air.
                "Sergeant Blore! what does this mean?" cried Mr. Win- kle, fully aroused by the
                smell of gunpowder, whch he knew could not be the effects of a dream, or the
                creation of a lively imagination. "Blore, I say! D---- your eye!" continued A

                of this party. If Blore is not in his bed, he is guilty. Honor or no honor--I'll
                give them a les- son! I can't find myslippers. Insubordination and disobedi- ence!
                The legs of my drawers are twisted. I'll have them all drummed out of my service!
                Here's your night-cap, madam. Blore! Blore, I say!" continued the exasperated
                command er, striding across the corridor, and bursting open the door of the
                sergeant's chamber. "Who comes there"? Halt, or I fire!" cried the sergeant, and at
                the same time cocking a pistol, which could be distinct- ly heard by the intruder.
                "It's your general, Blore. Don't kill him on his wedding night. I thought you were
                the leader of a storming party that won't permit Mrs. Winkle to enjoy any repose.
                Have you been up, Blore?" "No, sir, upon the word of a soldier." "Did you not just
                now hear the report of musketry under the very walls of-the house?" "No, sir; you
                must have been dreaming of battles." "No, Blore. Besides, our chamber is filled with
                the smoke." "Imagination." "I tell you no! Griselda heard it, and is now almost
                smothered with the smell of burnt powder." of herIt may be the devil's breath. I
                think he is an admirer of hers." "Irreverent monster! Hiow dare you speak in that
                man- ner of my spouse!"Uttering these indignant words, the com- mander closed the
                door violently, and returned to his own chamber. After reconnoitering the ground
                from the windows, and finding no symptoms of animation, he rejoined his spouse,
                assaring her that the enemy had fled, and would not be likely to disturb them again.
                Griselda, in tears, vented a great many reproaches, and succeeded in obtaining a
                promise that certain reforms should be instituted in the household. Then profound
                silence again ensued, which was, however, soon interrupted by the snoring of
                Napoleon, a sound for which Walter was impatiently listening. Again the signalwas
                given, and another volley ensued, more startling than the first. Walter leaped into
                his bed. <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6922-00000063"/> "4 THE WINKLES. Blore began to snore. The bride renewed her
                screams, and the heavy body of the groom was distinctly heard in its descent to the
                floor. Seizing a brace of pistols, Mr. Winkle rushed to the window, and discharged
                them through the clouds of smoke at whatever objects might be standing below, for
                the earth it- self was invisible. "I am firing balls!" said he. "It will not be
                child's play if any one comes in range. Where is my sword?" he contin- ued, rushing
                to the corner where the weapon invariably hung. Now, I'll see who it is!" He ran out
                of the chamber, and once more entered the sergeant's room. "Who goes there?" cried
                the sergeant. "I! it is Napoleon I The house is beset! My sword is drawn, and shall
                not be returned to its scabbard until my ene- mies are subdued. Follow me!"He turned
                about and de. scended the broad stairway, while Griselda called upon him in vain to
                return. He rushed out into the yard as soon as he could open the door, by which time
                the sergeant had joined him, and they searched in every direction for the invaders.
                The sword was thrust into every bush, and Blore was ordered to fire his pistols at
                every tree. But no enemy could be found, al- though the smoke of the recent
                discharges descended from the roof and rolled in volumes over the lawn. Meantime a
                suspicion crossed the mind of Griselda, that Walter might be the contriver-of the
                mischief, and she made no scruple of satisfying herself on that point in a very
                direct manner. She ran into his chamber, and never paused until she stood beside his
                bed. "Are you here, Walter?" she asked, although, at the time, she held him firmly
                by the wrist. "Of course I am," was the reply. "But what are you do- ing here?" "Oh!
                had I known I was to suffer thus," she exclaimed hysterically, c I would not have
                married your uncle! To think I should be so insulted and frightened the first night
                of my married life! What shall I do, dear Walter!" "Go to bed!" "Your uncle has gone
                out to hunt the villains, and I am frightened half to death." "What is the matter?
                What frightens you?" "Did you not hear it? They have been firing a hundred guns
                under our windows." WHO GOES THERE? 115 "They have? I must have been asleep. Who did
                it?" "No one knows. There! didn't you hear that? It is Ser- geant Blore's pistols

                till I dress." "Don't call me Gusset, Walter." "Very well. But I must get up." "Do,
                Walter," said Griselda, retiring, "and rouse all the people about the house. Find
                out the names of the ringleaders, and I'll answer for it, they will not frighten us
                another time." Walter manifested great zeal in his endeavors to dis- cover the
                guilty party. Every one was roused; and by the time his uncle and the sergeant
                returned from their fruit- less search without, every apartment within had been
                explored, but to no purpose. But before attempting again to seek the repose so
                impera- tively demanded after such unreasonable interruptions, a new idea occurred
                to Mrs. Winkle, and the proposition she made obtained the hearty approbation of her
                lord. This was to bring the bull-dog from the garrison, and to turn the whole pack
                of hounds loose on the lawn. The order was issued, and immediately executed; and as
                the bull-dog was really a very dangerous animal, the chief solaced himself with the
                belief that the house could not be again approached with impunity by his tormentors.
                Quiet being again restored under such favorable auspices, and one or two
                blunderbusses having been ordered into Napo- leon's room from the armory, the bride
                again retired to her canopied couch-and was just falling into an oblivious slumber,
                when Walter gave the signal, and another volley was fired I The bridegroom tumbled
                out of bed, and running to the nearest window, fired the blunderbuss at random,
                which took effect among the pack of hounds below, and such a squalling and howling
                ensued as never before assailed Griselda's ears. She screamed, and tore her
                dishevelled hair, while her lord gave vent to volley after volley of fierce
                maledictions. Again he rushed into the sergeant's room, into which, as into all the
                rest, the smoke had by this time penetrated, and again his ears were saluted with
                the interrogation, "Who goes there?" They descended to the lawn, the chief with his
                drawn <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6922-00000064"/> "6 THE WINKLES. sword, and the sergeant with his pistols. No
                less than four of the hounds lay wounded and howling on the green sward. They were
                despatched for the sake of peace. But they made no discovery of the offenders. And
                Griselda ran into Walter'g room a second time, and implored him, if he were
                concerned in the annoyance, to cease for her sake, and for his own sake in the
                future. "Do you not see I have been lying quietly in my bed?" said he. "I am almost
                determined to get up and go home!" "I wish you would, and take me with you!" said
                the weeping bride. "They have made no discovery," said she. "I hear them fastening
                the hall door again. I will sit up the rest of the night and watch. What string is
                this, Wal- ter?" she continued, having espied the cord that hung down from the
                balustrade and entered the window. "What string? Oh, that's nothing! Let it alone.
                Don't touch it! It is a part of a bird's nest above." "I won't have birds' nests on
                the house. Let them build in the trees!" Saying this she pulled the cord violently,
                and the next moment a volley, more stunning than any that had preceded it, rent the
                air. Poor Griselda fell fainting in the arms of Walter, who bore her into her own
                room, and laid her on her bed, where he left her. As he returned to the corridor he
                perceived his uncle, followed by the sergeant, re-descending the stairway with all
                the expedition in their power, evidently impressed with the belief that the
                intruders would now stand revealed before them. But the commander was certainly dis-
                appointed, and he retraced his steps, expressing his belief that his house was
                infested by the ghosts of soldiers slain in battle. "That may satisfy you," said his
                recovered spouse, incen- sed at being left alone in her swoon, " but not me. I don't
                believe in such things at all. It is a contrivance to mortify and vex me, and I'll
                find it out. Let them fire away. They don't hurt us. I'm not alarmed now. There will
                be an end of it in the morning. But I want you to promise that when I have detected
                and exposed the villains, they shall never come about the house again." This was
                readily granted, and soon after the overwrought Napoleon's snore began once more to
                be heard. Walter was listening in the corridor; but now Griselda, who had risen, was
                on the alert, and nerved to brave any thing that phantoms THE OPFENDER DISCOVERED.
                117 or flesh and blood might do. She glided to the door, and with her ear to the
                key-hole distinguished the breathing of the young man. She heard him retire to his
                own room, and she followed him softly. It was just when he extended his hand to
                seize the cord, that his arm was grasped by his aunt. He turned in dismay, and gazed
                at her. I've caught you, Walter! I understand it now. I thought the sound came from
                above. It was a wicked contri- vance. What have I done to deserve this?" "Oh, it was
                only a little sport. Don't tell uncle Winkle, and you shall not be disturbed any
                more." "I shall make no promises, unless you promise-swear-- no-no matter. I have
                you in my power, now. Beware! You may escape until the next offence. But the
                villains shall be banished from my sight. See! the day has broken, and the sun about
                to rise. I will awaken your uncle, and show him who dared to disturb his peace."
                "No! aunt-dear aunt - " "It is too late. You may escape, but not the rascals on the
                roof. I only wish the foolish sergeant had been among them." She hastened to put her
                threat in execution, and assisted her lord in a hasty adjustment of his toilet. The
                offending party-or rather the instruments of the con- trivers of the plot-were
                discovered, and made the victims of Griselda's vengeance. They were ordered down,
                and forbid- den to approach the house again under penalty of dismissal from the
                service. Bill Dizzle, however, escaped identification by an acci- dental discharge
                of his musket, which completely blackened his face. It was, after all, a great
                triumph for the mistress of the establishment, as it afforded her an opportunity of
                making many demands of her lord, to accomplish which might, other- wise, have
                required much ingenuity and long suffering. i <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6922-00000065"/> "8 THE WINKLES. CHAPTER XII. A
                MOONLIGHT ADVENTURE, AND SOME OF THE CONSEQUENCES. ALTHOUGH Lucy had listened to so
                many proposals of a nature calculated to produce an exaltation of spirits, yet, as
                we have seen, she was the unresisting victim of a sad depression during the progress
                of the festivities. When the time was an- nounced for her departure, a scene of
                contention between the coachmen of the Arums and the Crudles, for precedence, occur-
                red in front of the portico, and within her view, while the car- riage which was to
                convey her to the village was kept in waiting. She felt no resentment, however, and
                could not endure any additional mortification. The tumult of her sensations, and the
                whirl of her recently startled thoughts, had not sufficient- ly subsided, for her
                attention to be arrested by the scene of strife she witnessed; and the imperturbable
                submission of her own coachmanl prevented him from taking advantage of the
                opportunity afforded of departing with his charge, while the point in dispute
                between the rival whips was undergoing the process of adjustment. Her aunt stood
                upon one side, and Walter on the other. Lowe appeared when the Arums and the Crudles
                drove off, and assisted her up the carriage steps. He whispered, that although he
                would return on foot, he thought he might be able to keep in view of her, and act in
                the capacity of a guard. This was after Walter had intimated that if he were in
                Lowe's place he would be Lucy's companion inside; but the intima- tion had not been
                approved by Griselda. The distance was short, and the moon shone with great
                splendor. Mr. Dowly turned his slow pacing horse to the right and pursued his way
                directly towards his own isolated mansion. Lowe bounded forward in pursuit of Lucy's
                carriage. But he was not able to overtake it. The driver, hitherto so stu- pidly
                immobile, upon seeing the pedestrian cracked his whip, dashed several hundred yards
                ahead, and suddenly halted. Had Lowe been something nearer the object of his
                interest, undoubtedly his heart had been thrilled to its centre. As it was, he
                imagined that cries had been uttered. ANOTHER PROPOSAL. 119 No sooner did the
                carriage pause than a man stepped from behind a huge sycamore tree, and pulled open
                the door. He sprang in, and the horses were again driven at a rapid pace. "r Mr.
                Roland! What is meant by this conduct?" cried Lucy, striving to be calm, or rather
                to repress her rising fears as if she could not be convinced that all her presence
                of mind and physical strength would soon be called in requisition. "' That I adore

                hand he had seiz- ed, you confess, then, that this rude and ungentlemanly con- duct

                Richard-- -" "He was a villain! Heaven forbid that you should be one, too! Sir! if

                humble adoring lover?" "I promise nothing. I never have encouraged your ad-

                cannot live without you. And why not be mistress of all I possess-and now? All I
                am-ali I have, shall be yours. The Arums and Crudles shall triumph over you no more.

                offered me. Yours I never can be. I would rather subsist on the crumbs that fall

                the mistress of my house, command my servants, hold my purse --I "Let me go!" cried
                the trembling girl, springing towards the carriage door. "No. It is useless for the
                lovely bird to struggle," said he, forcibly withholding her. "Hear me-listen to
                reason. I do not desire to take advantage of your helpless condition. I will prove
                my sincerity. I have a preacher in readiness, who shall unite us in holy wedlock. It
                will not detain you five minutes. Then, if you will pledge me that our secret shall
                be kept until the proper time for divulging it, you may depart immediately, and no
                one will be the wiser, until we choose to inform them. You shall take the mortgage
                with you, and my check for any sum you may name." "Villain! Unhand me! You will have
                to answer for this! It is base-it is cowardly!" "Lucy, do not spurn my love! The
                highest born, the most accomplished, the most wealthy ladies in the country, have

                command you to drive me home, to my mother's house! ' Oh, my love," said Roland,
                with a smile of derision half betrayed by the rays of the moon resting on his
                profile, " the coachman has had his orders. He knows his duty. He will obey you when
                yonder preacher, awaiting our arrival, has ut- tered a few words over our joined

                " cried the poor girl, and fainted in the arms of the villain, who forced her from
                the carriage. But at that moment he felt the sharp teeth of Dew grasping his leg.
                "Begone!'" he said, endeavoring to shake the animal- off. The infernal dog is
                tearing my flesh!" he continued, placing the inanimate burden on the grass, and
                turning ferociously upon his tormentor. Dew relinquished his hold, and barked
                fiercely, but avoided the hands extended to grasp him, by re- 6 <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6922-00000067"/>

                a stone at him, without effect, and turned towards Lucy, who was recovering. She
                leaned on her elbow, and gazed round in bewilderment. "Drive off l" cried Roland, to
                the coachman, who obeyed with alacrity. "Off t off! Do not approach me!" cried Lucy,
                seeing the monster approach, followed by the faithful Dew, who again seized him.
                With a fearful malediction, Roland once more turned upon his pertinacious foe, and
                with a determination to take his life. He was smarting under the infliction of his
                teeth, and furious at the thought of being balked by so unlooked-for and ap.
                parently so insignificant an impediment. Therefore he rushed upon the animal with
                desperate energy, regardless of the briery covert in which he took shelter. Dew
                uttered several cries as he was torn by the thorns, but still eluded his enemy.
                Roland, intent upon the destruction of the animal, continued the assault, unmindful
                for the moment of his reviving cap- tive. Lucy did not suffer the precious moments
                to pass unim- proved. She started up and ran into a neighboring grove, which
                concealed her white dress. Under shelter of the de- scending boughs of a spreading
                cedar-tree, she paused for breath, and with her trembling hands sought to still the
                throb- bings of her panting breast. Unseen herself, she could yet behold Roland
                striving to kill her faithful dog with a stake he had snatched from the fence in
                front of the lawn. Dew nevertheless effected his escape, and returned to the spot
                where his mistress had been lying. Roland, upon seeing the bird had flown, uttered
                the most furious oaths and threats. But in his impatience to extricate himself from
                the briery thicket, he was tripped up by a vine that grew among the bushes, and fell
                headlong to the ground. Dew joined his mistress, and they plunged deeper into the
                woods. Lucy knew not whither they were going, but was happy in the thought of
                escaping an enemy whose presence was a greater calamity than any other that could
                possibly be- fall her. Erelong the flying girl discovered a narrow path, partially
                illuminated by the rays of the moon straggling through the branches of the trees.
                She redoubled her speed, for she could ANXIOUS MOMENT. 123 hear Roland calling aloud
                to his confederate (the pretended preacher), to assist him in the search for the
                fugitive. Soon the voice ceased to be heard, and Lucy's spirits began to re- vive.
                Dew ran along before her, evincing by his large intel. ligent eyes, and the shaking
                of his tail his congratulations and happiness upon the escape of his mistress from
                the imme. diate clutches of her cruel persecutor. But he had sufficient sagacity to
                confine his manifestations of joy to the mute exhi- bitions described. The slightest
                bark might have destroyed her. After traversing the path several hundred yards, Lucy
                was induced to pause upon coming in view of a fence which bounded the woods. Beyond
                were fields and meadows, and here and there could be distinguished a farm house, its
                inmates seemingly steeped in profound repose, while she, who gazed upon the silent
                scene, might conjecture in vain why she should be doomed to be a midnight wanderer
                in unfrequented paths, and wholly unconscious of the direction she should pursue to
                avoid the impending danger. Wearied, ana wounded by the bushes which had often
                opposed her progress, she sat down on the trunk of a fallen tree, and wept in
                silence. As she turned her pale face in every direction, and saw no animate object
                but her spaniel which crouched at her feet, and heard no sounds but those of the
                whippoorwill and the katydid, it more than once occurred to her that she might be in
                a dream. She rubbed her eyes with her lily hands, and looked up at the stars-"No i
                no!" said she, in low silvery tones, " it is not a dream. Would it were!" She
                covered her face, and falling down on her knees, uttered an humble petition to
                heaven that she might be speedily rescued from her unpleasant con- dition. A sound
                in the path she had traversed attracted her, and the next moment a rabbit bounded
                out and sped past. Dew rose up, but did not pursue it. He snuffed the air in the
                direction whence it came, and uttered a low growl, while the hair rose on his back.
                Lucy thought she heard a movement among the bushes; but was not certain. Her heart
                palpitated audibly, and painfully. Then she felt certain she could detect the low
                sounds of whispers in the dark path behind. She arose-but knew not where to ly. In
                the fields were no hid- ing places; in the woods she would encounter her persecutor.
                Again! It was the low murmur of a human voice! She could <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6922-00000068"/> 124 THE WINKLES.
                not be mistaken; and Dew growled more fiercely than ever, and was in the act of
                springing towards the foe. At that moment approaching wheels were heard, and Lucy
                perceived that a road ran along the outer side of the fence. Hope lent her strength,
                and she bounded over the high fence as the gig of good old John Dowly drove up. The
                gentle horse paused of his own accord, snorted aloud, and thrust for- ward his ears,
                but did not attempt to run away. "Who are you?" asked John Dowly, staring at Lucy as
                if beholding an apparition. "Save me! Save me I Oh, Mr. Dowly!" cried she. "I will
                -l Poor thing! Who is it?" responded he, as he assisted her into the gig. She
                fainted upon his breast, after feebly saying, "Take me home." The dog barked
                fiercely, and words of disappointment and rage could be heard in the woods. Merciful
                powers!" exclaimed te old man, upon driving into the unobstructed moonlight, and
                recognizing the face of Lucy, who began to recover. "My poor, lovely child! how does
                it happen that I find you thus, and alone? But do not attempt to speak, before you
                have regained your strength. I will take you home. The next road we cross leads to
                town. You are safe, now. Don't be distressed. Old John Dowly would lose his head
                before a hair of yours should be in- jured." "Bless you, sir!"-said Lucy. "May
                heaven bless you! You have saved me. Another moment, and I should have been in his
                power!" "In whose power, my child? But I need not ask, since I know too well the
                diabolical proprietor of these lands." Saying this, the old gentleman whipped his
                horse into a brisk trot, and turning down the next road, seemed to be intent on
                reaching the village as quickly as possible. But before they reached the village,
                Lucy had summoned sufficient strength and resolution to relate every thing that had
                transpired. The old gentleman sympathized with her, wept with her, but counselled
                her to tell no one else but her mother, who would doubtless be governed by
                prudential considerations. Roland was an artful and dangerous character; and it
                would be better to avoid him than to contend against him. He was surrounded by
                creatures of desperate character, whose greatest delight was inth consummation of
                evil deeds. SAFE ARRIVAL AT HOHE. 125 Lucy listened with attention; and shivered
                with terror at the thought of involving Walter, or any one dear to her, in a quarrel
                with the bold bad man. Mr. Dowly, when they arrived in front of the widow's mansion,
                leapt down from the gig almost with the elasticity of youth, and conducted'his fair
                charge to the door. Mrs. Winkle had been long expecting the return of Lucy, and on
                hearing the wheels, hastened to thedoor herself, for Biddy had been sent to bed at
                the usual hour. " How pale you are, Lucy " said she, when the lamp re- vealed the
                features of her child. "What has happened Who came with you?" "I, madam," said the
                old gentleman, whose person was disclosed when the-door turned wider. "Oh, Mr.
                Dowly! The one, of all others, I would have chosen to conduct her home. I am very
                thankful, sir, for your kind attention. I am fearful though it has put you to
                inconvenience. It is very late. But you need not return- Walter is away. Pray come
                in and occupy his chamber." ' No--no-I thank you, my dear madam. I will drive to the
                inn. But with your permission I will call in the morning and take breakfast with
                you. Good night. Good night," continued the old man, retiring. When the door was
                made fast, Lucy fell into her mother's arms and wept bitterly, and yet with feelings
                of thankfulness that she was once more in safety under the roof of her pa- rent. The
                tale was soon told, and was listened to without the widow's usual merriment. She
                embraced her child repeated- ly, long incapable of utterance, and caressed the
                faithful spaniel, who evinced unbounded joy. "Mr. Dowly is right, Lucy," at length
                said the widow with seriousness. "He has ever shown a sincere interest in the
                welfare of my family. He is experienced in the affairs of the world, and can foresee
                evils which those of a less deliberate circumspection might only feel If Walter knew
                what has occurred, who could restrain him? And there are others beside who might
                seek to punish the villain, and might fall in the attempt. All we can do with safety
                is to avoid any spe- cies of contact with him in future." "But, dear mother," said
                Lucy, "we are, ashe said, very poor; and he holys the mortgage on our house." <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6922-00000069"/>
                126 THE WINKLES. "True. I will write to my brother to pay it. Yet I dis. like making
                such an application. I am fearful we have not understood Gusset's true character. I
                will mention the busi. ness when Napoleon visits us the next time. If Roland should
                call for the interest, I will pay him with the money the Dibbles have deposited in
                bank. You must not be seen by him-I shall not fear to meet him. He is rich and
                influential, and might have been respected as a rejected suitor; but to say that one
                of his age is capable of conceiving so violent a passion as to be driven
                involuntarily into such an excess of outrage-no-no! I can have no patience with him!
                He must be a villain. But it may not be prudent to tell him so. He might declare,
                and even prove, by some of his profligate creatures, that you accompanied him to his
                house volun- tarily!" After Lucy had retired to her chamber, she was impelled by
                some mysterious impulse to cast her eyes in the direction of Lowe's cottage on the
                opposite side of the street. The young man's chamber was still lighted, and his
                shadow on the wall could be discerned. He moved backwards and forwards with folded
                arms and drooping head. Why did he keep such late vigils? was the query the
                distressed girl propounded to herself. Lowe continued his solitary promenade until
                startled at a late hour by the report of musketry, which came booming on the still
                air from the country mansion of Mr. Winkle. He had likewise observed the pause of
                the carriage which con- veyed Lucy from the mansion, and beheld Roland get into it.
                He had no doubt it was Roland. But whether or not the proceeding had the connivance-
                and sanction of Lucy, he was unable to determine. If so, then he had been grievously
                de- ceived in her character, and he felt that his fate would be an unhappy one. But
                had he ever seen any thing in her conduct, or heard any thing in relation to her
                character, which might warrant a supposition that she entertained a partiality for
                that bad man? No. All had been just the reverse. And yet there could be no doubt of
                what he had seen. There could be no denying the fact which he had beheld that night
                with his own eyes. Such were his thoughts. "OOh!" cried he, clasping his forehead,
                "if she be not pure, where, where is purity to be found on earth I But may not she
                still be so? Might not he have entered the carriage without her consent,

                then to accompany him-or suffer herself to be driven elsewhere than to her parents'
                mansion-and at that late hour of the night! I am not certain I heard her screams.
                And would she not have uttered them loudly if he had forced her to ac- company him
                in another direction 2 True, she is not one of those falsely delicate,
                mincingly-sensitive creatures, who cry out at the buzzing of a fly, and she might
                not have immediate- ly known they diverged from the proper direction. But would he,
                bold and wicked as he is, have resorted to such a measure in the vicinity of so many
                returning guests? Oh, Lucy! if you have been too weak to resist his blandishments,
                farewell-farewell for ever! We must never meet again. But I will know, yes, know-not
                merely suspect-your complicity in this act, before I regard you as fallen. But how
                shall I know it From whom obtain the information? Ay, himself I Yes, Roland-whatever
                your lips may utter, your face, your conduct under my gaze, shall reveal enough for
                my com- prehension. And if you alone are guilty, beware of her avenger!" The young
                man turned aside and threw himself on his couch. A train of cars at that moment
                paused before the inn, and once the lover conceived the idea of rushing into them
                and abandoning the place for ever. He was withheld by the hope that, after all,
                Lucy's conduct might not prove to be culpable. Should that hope be fallacious, the
                next night he would take his final departure. He arose the next morning unrefreshed,
                after a sleepless night. While tasting the coffee, which had been brought in by Mrs.
                Edwards, his attention was attracted by one of Ro- land's servants who galloped up
                to the door of Mrs. Winkle's house. He saw him deliver a letter, which he did not
                doubt related to the occurrence of the preceding night. Soon after, he ascertained
                from his cook, who had been in his neighbor's kitchen, that Lucy had arrived at home
                late in the night, and was now quite ill. Supposing Roland would be in the village
                as usual that morning, and would come by the road he was accustomed to traverse,
                Lowe determined to meet him. Placing a brace of pistols in a small green bag, he
                descended to the street and walked briskly away from the village. He had not gone
                more than a mile before he saw the one he was in quest of. <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6922-00000070"/> 128 THE WINKLES.
                Roland approached alone, leisurely riding his blooded steed. Lowe paused beside a
                large willow tree that overhung the brook on the road side, and putting down the
                bag, folded his arms calmly on his breast, and awaited the arrival of the author of
                his unhappiness. As Roland drew near a supercilious frown gathered on his brow, and
                his ruddy complexion assumed a deeper color. He did not design to utter any
                salutation, and was riding past after an equivocal nod, when Lowe advanced a step,
                and sig- nified his desire to confer with him. "Do you wish me to stop?" asked
                Roland, slightly draw- ing the rein. "I do, sir," was the reply. "Well-what do you
                want?" "I desire to know if you did not enter Miss Winkle's car- riage last night,
                when she was returning home." "The deuce you do! No, sir-I entered my own car-
                riage." "True, it was your carriage But that is a subterfuge." (A subterfuge! Sir,
                do you know who you are speaking to?" demanded Roland, in choler. "Perhaps not
                distinctly. But I am desirous of knowing. Be calm, sir; at least until I obtain the
                information I seek. Thef your fury may have vent." "What information do you seek? By
                what right do you seek any of me? Have you heard any thing in relation to the matter
                you mentioned just now?" "No, sir; not a word. But I saw it." "Saw it? Then what
                further would you be pleased to know " "Precisely in what capacity you entered the
                carriage. Whether as an acceptable companion, or in opposition to the lady's will.
                You will much oblige me by answering frankly and truly." "Hshall do no such thing,
                sir." "Then I shall be happy to suppose it was not in accord- ance with the lady's
                wishes." "Suppose what you please. I care not. But as the lady herself has not, as I
                infer, made the matter known, and as you were the only witness of what transpired,
                if the occurrence should be made public, I shall not be at a loss to know who A
                COWARD. 129 divulged the secret. I desire that it be kept a secret, for several
                reasons, and I warn you not to mention it, or- " 'What?" "You will incur my
                vengeance." "I will not refer to it-unless it be to the lady herself. But, sir, I
                beseech you tell me whether or not the meeting was in pursuance of an appointment."
                "You have already supposed it was not-let that suffice. I will not be interrogated.
                Who are you? What are you doing in the village? By what right do you aspire to be
                the champion of Miss Winkle?" "I am a man, sir-a free man in a free country. It is
                not necessary to dwell upon my means of living, so long as I owe no one, and ask no
                alms of any body. In regard to your last question, as we are alone, and as I seek
                information from you upon which my happiness or misery may depend-know that I have
                conceived a deep and pure affection for that young lady--" "Ha! ha! The secret's
                out!" "Sir! you cannot be a lover, and laugh at such an an. nouncement. Therefore
                she must be innocent, and you a vil- lain!" "What! Do you dare-- cried Roland,
                raising his whip. "Dismount, sir, and you shall have satisfaction," said Lowe,
                stepping back. "I will dismount and punish you " said Roland, leaping from his
                horse, and supposing the threat might be easily exe- cuted, as he was a larger and
                stronger man than Lowe. "Throw your whip away, and meet me as a gentleman should,"
                said Lowe, stooping down and drawing forth his pis- tols. Taking one in each hand he
                presented the breeches. "You are armed. I did not,know that," said Roland, pale, and
                pausing. ( Take year choice, sir." "No, sir. I am not to be waylaid in this manner.
                I will have you arrested as a highwayman." "Are you a coward, too?" "Coward! because
                I will not exchange shots with a vaga- bond?" "Sir, I am a gentleman, better born,
                and better bred than yourself," continued Lowe, advancing. "Take your choice, 6* <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6922-00000071"/>

                that advan. age. I am no duellist-but desperate. I would rather die han know Lucy to

                may murder me-but yonder is a witness." He )ointed to a solitary pedestrian at some
                distance who was ap- )roaching. "I am no murderer-but you are a craven and a
                villain. Cease your designs upon that young lady, or dread my ven- reance. We will
                meet again. Go." But before the last words were uttered, Roland was mounted nd
                spurring towards the village. When he was dashing across ne of the slight bridges
                which span the sloughs through which bhe water from the river flowed at high tide,
                he was thrown by X sudden side-spring of his horse, and fell sprawling in the centre
                of the hard road. Bill Dizzle, aroused by the clatter of hoofs had suddenly risen up
                among the spatter docks, with a huge frog transfixed and kicking in expiring agonies
                on his spear. His presence in the slough was no unusual apparition to man or beast;
                but as he had not yet washed the black stains of burnt powder from his face, the
                horse had failed to recognize him, and per- haps supposed him to be the devil
                himself rising to the surface of the earth. Hence his affright. "Blazes!" cried
                Bill, wading out of the scum-covered water. "Who is it? There he lays as dead as a
                frog!"He approached the stunned and inanimate form, and stood over it in silent
                amazement, not knowing exactly what he ought to do, but strongly impressed with the
                desire to accomplish some- thing or other. So, happening to glance towards the
                horse, which now stood in the vicinity snorting and trembling, he ran to him, and
                taking the reins, tied him to the fence on the road- side. That done, he scarcely
                knew what to do next. He returned to the fallen rider, and again stood over him in
                silent contemplation, until startled by the sound of approaching wheels. Fortunately
                it was the carriage of Dr. Prangle. The doctor, upon seeing that some one lay in the
                dust, and doubt- less required his services, did not wait for a special summons, but
                descended immediately and opened a vein. "How is this?" exclaimed the doctor, after
                seeing that the blood began to flow. "How did it happen that Mr. Ro- land, the best
                horseman in the county, was thrown?" A FALL. 131 "His critter shied when I riz up in
                the water lilies," said Bill Dizzle. "And no wonder!" exclaimed the doctor, gazing
                at Bill. "It was enough to frighten the d-1 himself I So-"he continued, examining
                his patient, "limbs all sound-no frac- ture-animation returning-a groan-good

                "Dr. Prangle, what is the matter?" asked Roland, recover- ing his speech, and seeing
                the blood flow from his arm. "You have been thrown from your horse, and may be
                seriously injured internally. You must be kept quiet-take anodynes, and lie still,

                will take you to my house---", "No," said Roland-" take me to the inn." "Very good.
                But you cannot lie there so composedly as at my house." He was conveyed to the inn
                without delay, while Bill mounted the still snorting horse and followed the
                carriage. Roland, upon being put to bed, smiled at the anxious soli- citude of the
                doctor, and whispered the innkeeper-one of his tenants-that he was not much injured,
                and would be able to sit up as soon as PrangIe left him. And no sooner had the
                doctor taken his leave, with injunctions for his patient to re- main in a state of
                perfect composure, and promising to return within an hour, than Roland sat up in
                bed, and vented a volley of curses on the head of the astonished Dizzle. Bill
                retreated in consternation from his presence. "Send for David Deal," said Roland,
                when Dizzle had disappeared. Deal was an enterprising Quaker, and considered
                favorable to the election of Roland to Congress, on account of sundry moral reform
                which the Babbleton candidate was pledged to advocate. "Friend Ralph, I am sorry to
                see thee confined to thy bed," said David Deal, who happened to be near, and was
                ushered into the presence of the invalid. "Itis nothing," said Roland. "Merely
                stunned by a fall from my horse. If it were not for fear of offending the doc- tor
                and losing his vote, I would not remain here an hour. David, he continued, when they
                were alone, " do you know the character and pursuit of your tenant in -- street?"

                trade, or profession, or pursuit, by which he earns a subsistence?" "Thee knows

                advance. Thee my be sure he pays me, or I would not let him stay." "The deuce!"
                "Friend Ralph, I do no wrong in securing what is justly due to me. And I hope you
                will not 'urge the payment of the note of mine thee holds, if I pay thee the
                interest punc- tually." "But does not this fellow owe some one in the village " "I
                think not. I have taken the liberty, as I thought it not improper, to inquire a
                little into his transactions. The shopkeeper, the butcher, the baker, and even the
                milkman, all say he pays them down, and seems to have cash enough to answer his
                purposes. Thee knows he don't live extravagantly, and his expenses cannot be very
                great. But friend Ralph, what does thee say concerning my note?" "Confound your
                note-I don't want money!" "I am much obliged to thee--for it is very difficult to
                ob- tain funds at a reasonable interest; and it is generous and liberal in thee to
                indulge thy friend in such times as these. I am sorry I cannot give thee any
                information concerning friend Edmund. All I know is that he has many books, and is
                seen to do nothing but read and write, and sometimes indulge in the abominable
                amusement of whist, and in the idle sport of fishing and gunning. He is also very
                intimate with Edith, and seems to have an attachment for her daughter Lucy---" "The
                impudent puppy!" said Roland. "If thee thinks so, the women don't. Edith owes thee a
                large sum of money, and it is said she is very poor. I am sorry to hear it-for she
                has always been a good neighbor. I hope she may be able to pay thee thy interest " '
                The mortgage shall be foreclosed, and the property sold." "If it must be so, will
                thee be a bidder for the lot " "No. I have enough real estate." "Then if thee would
                be satisfied with my bond, I would like to be the purchaser, for a dozen good houses

                should be sorry for Edith. I see such things are unpleasant to thee, and will change
                the subject. Thy friends will have a large meeting next week, and are determined to
                make a strong rally in thy favor. I hope thee will be able to address them." "I will
                be able." "Thee will be supported by the reformers. It is high time the evil
                practices of the people were amended.- But, as the meeting is open for all, they say
                thy enemies will have their speakers also." "Who will they have to reply to me?"
                "Walter Winkle-the college bred son of Edith." "He!" "They say so. But thee knows he
                is a wild rattling youth, without experience." "He is over twenty-one years of age.
                Of course he will vote for Plastic, my competitor. Well, I'll see if he cannot be
                humbled. Who proposed this matter of getting up a speaker to answer me?" " "I learn
                it was Colonel Oakdale, who thee knows is a can- didate for the State Senate, and
                is, they say, to be a candidate for a seat in the Senate of the United Sates." "The
                mischief!" "That is milder than-- " "The d-1!" Yea, verily. I bid you good day,
                friend Ralph, and I hope thee will soon be well." David Deal, not without some
                misgivings of the morality of the candidate of the reformers, withdrew about his
                busi- ness, which was, it must not be denied, the art and mystery of money-making.

                NOT TELL HER LOVER WHTHER. "UCY, who had complained of being unwell at the usual
                hour for breakfast, upon learning that a letter had been received from Roland, arose
                and descended to the sitting-room, where her mother was perusing the long anid
                passionate communi- cation. "Lucy," said Mrs. Winkle, as her daughter sat down at
                her side, "Roland writes like a lover. He declares upon his honor---" "Which amounts
                to nothing, for he has none," interrupt- ed Lucy. "That may be. But he says his love
                grew so uncontrol- lable that he was not aware of the gross impropriety of his
                conduct, until after your escape, when his own condemnation of himself, was as
                bitter as any reproaches it would be possi- ble for any one else to utter. He says
                he is penitent, and will cheerfully undergo any suffering and pay any penalty we may
                impose. He implores our forgiveness, and entreats that the occurrence may never be
                referred to again." "I will not mention it." "I think it should not be known. The
                Arums and Cru- dies would hint that you had not been abducted against your will."
                "That would be terrible," replied- Lucy, smiling. "I learned from Walter last night
                that they abducted his two friends, almost forcibly. I hope that is Walter ringing."
                "Who is it, Biddy?" asked Urs. Winkle, when the girl appeared. "Dill Bizzle, mam.".
                "Biddy," said Lucy, "I wish you would learn to call his name correctly. It is Bill
                Dizzle." "Yes, miss." "Let him come in, if he desires it," said the widow; and a
                moment after Bill made his appearance, his face still un- washed. "Mercy on us!"
                exclaimed Lucy. "UCY DETERMNES TO FLY. 135 "Don't be frightened, like the horse,"
                said the frog- catcher. "It's only the powder. Didn't you hear us last night She's
                in a mighty stew about it, and she's vanished all the soldiers from the house
                a'ready." "What do you mean?" asked the widow. Bill explained. But he had the tact
                to suppress the part Walter enacted. "I fear your uncle," said the widow, turning to
                her daugh. ter," has got a mistress at last. Who would have thought the humble
                Gusset capable of seizing the reins so boldly, and holding them so firmly? If we
                desire a continuance of my brother's favors, I fear we will have to pay court to his
                wife." "I fear the worst," said Lucy. "But what have you to tell us, Bill?" demanded
                the widow. "Only that Mr. Roland has been thrown by his horse, and- " "Killed?"
                asked Lucy, quickly. Bill related the whole affair and then departed. "Did you
                desire to hear of his death?" asked Mrs. Winkle, laughing heartily. "No, mother. But
                it would afford me a feeling of secu- rity to learn that he was disabled from
                perpetrating any species of mischief. If he recovers soon, I hope you will permit me
                to spend a portion of my timewith my aunt." "You know, child, that your aunt would
                not have you, after disobeying her injunction, and attending the wedding." "I do not
                mean Aunt Wilsome; but Aunt Flora, in New York." "My sister Flora! Why she lives
                alone. She keeps but one servant--and I am told her front door is not opened once a
                month. She would never visit me, nor invite any of the family to her house, for fear
                of the expense. She is in per- petual dread of going to the poor-house I And I don't
                know why, for she had not less than thirty or forty thousand dollars from my
                father's estate. I think such a project impractica- ble." "You know, mother, the
                last time we called on her, when passing through the city, she seemed to take a
                fancy to me." "Yes, she said she would like to enjoy your company, if it would not
                render you miserable to be cooped up in her poor establishment." "And that is just
                what I desire-the utter seclusion, I <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6922-00000074"/> 136 THE WINKLES. mean. I will read novels
                for her from morning till night, and will be the more contented from a knowledge
                that visitors cannot intrude upon my privacy. Indeed, mother, I am wretched in the
                vicinity of that bad man." "Bad, I fear he is. Among all his explanations and
                promises, I do not remember a word about honorable mar- riage." "True, mother-but
                even the thought of that would be misery to me. He mentioned it to me. And I am sure
                I heard his pretended clergyman utter some foul oaths. Pray do permit me to write to
                Aunt Flora!" "Oh, you may write; and you may go to her, if she de- sires it, and
                will make you comfortable." Lucy lost not a moment in commencing a long letter to
                her aunt. Fortunately she had acquired an insight into her character, during the
                brief visit referred to. Her aunt's sole pleasure in life was novel-reading, and the
                work she most ad. mired, and which indeed proved she was not deficient in criti- cal
                acumen, was "The Children of the Abbey." Hence it was not difficult for Lucy to
                excite her relative's interest by depicting her own wrongs and woes in the light of
                those of poor Amanda. And Roland's character and his persecutions were not
                dissimilar to Colonel Belgrave's. Lowe was another Mortimer. Without the necessity
                of revealing any real names, Lucy had ample materials to affect the sensibilities of
                her aunt; and she was not incompetent to the task of group- ing her characters in
                the most imposing attitude. Having finished her letter and sent it to the
                post-office, Lucy felt relieved of the burden of painful apprehension which had
                oppressed her. Her spirits were recovered, her headache gone, and she sallied forth
                in the garden, singing one of the pathetic songs she loved. Old Dibble and his son
                Davy plucked for her the most beautiful and fragrant roses, and took delight in
                exhibiting their growing crops, the nests of the orioles, etc. After lingering some
                minutes with the Dibbles, who were always cheered by her smiles, as their vegetables
                were by the rays of the sun, Lucy strolled to the extreme boundary of the ground,
                where a row of willows overhung the cool bright wa- ters of the running brook. There
                she sat on a rustei seat in the shade, where she had passed so many happy hours of
                her childhood, and where she had often consumed the fleeting mo- YOU FRIGHTENEDV ME.

                for ever. She continued her low song, uttering in the pauses many a deep sigh, while
                the heaving of her bosom attested the sin- cerity and depth of the feelings she
                expressed. It was dur- ing one of those pauses, when endeavoring to recollect some
                of the words which had escaped her memory, that she was startled by the disturbed
                flight of several birds whose wings fanned her cheeks, so close had been their
                confiding prox- imity. Upon turning, the object of her thoughts stood before her,
                pale, sad and desponding. "Mr. Lowe! You frightened me, as well as the birds." "The
                birds have taken wing and flown away. I trust you will not be so cruel as to follow
                their example. And yet I never deceived or injured them." "Then why should they
                fly?" "They know the power of man-the most insidious, wick- ed, fearful animal that
                was ever created." "You speak that almost savagely.'? ' Sometimes I have the
                feelings of a savage!" "Mercy! you frighten me I But I, too, expect to fly. In a few
                days it is probable these old familiar haunts will be de- serted by their mistress.
                I came hither even now to take my leave of them." "Is it so? And you go voluntarily
                " "Eagerly! It will be at my -own earnest solicitation." "Lucy, there is a
                seriousness in your manner. Will you not be candid with the unhappy being who adores
                you, and say why you desire to go?" "Spare me-I would not breathe the reason; My
                mother only knows it." "But you will be accompanied by some one? And you will not
                travel far?" "By Walter. It will not be known where I shall be so- journing."
                "Mystery! I would it were not so. But Walter accom- panies you?" Certainly." "And it
                will be desirable to have your friends ignorant of the place of your abode? I am
                sorry for it." "There may be reasons why they should not know it. Oh, Mr. Lowe, do
                not question me further. Do not seek to <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6922-00000075"/> 138 . THE WINKLES. know why I
                would withdraw from my friends for a season. I go to avoid a great misery which
                threatens me here. Let that suffice." "Lucy, we are now similarly situated. I have m
                y mys- tery, and you have yours." And if yours were removed-how often have I
                said-but no-not now! yet mine might vanish, if yours were dispelled. Mr. Lowe, I
                have already avowed too much. I should have kept locked in my own breast the-the
                partiality I felt. But I have retained sufficient resolution never to take the
                irrevo- cable step you proposed, without my mother's hearty concur. rence. And yet
                it would seem that my secret should not be withheld from you. I have the impulse to
                disclose it, and would do so were it not for the fear it might imperil your safety.
                No such motion can withhold you from disclosing yours. Between friends-between those
                who- there should be no secrets unrevealed, mysteries unexplained. But let us part
                in peace, and await the time when there shall be no necessity for any more reserve.
                I doubt not you are justified in concealing what you are so reluctant to impart.
                Then, Oh, doubt not me! ' Ah, Lucy! I understand it all. Your secret is known to me.
                The danger you apprehend is past. We met this morning. He is both a villain and a
                coward!" "What do you mean? What am I to understand by your words?" "That I know
                every thing, up to the time the carriage diverged from the road it had been
                traversing. I saw him enter it. Then I saw no more, until I met him this morning and
                he refused to fight me. Look not so ghastly. It is not the subject of conversation,
                nor will it be. I was following your carriage, and beheld him enter it."
                "Cruel-cruel Edmund! You would not attempt a res- cue, supposing it possible I might
                be a willing captive!" "I was not mounted." "No matter! I was the victim of your
                ungenerous suspi- cions! If it had been a sister-a wife-there had been wings to your
                feet! No horses could have escaped your pursuit. Be it so! But learn that you did me
                great injustice. It was Roland -the monster above all others whom I most dread and
                despise. I can only say I escaped from him by means of the interposi- tion of my
                faithful dog. I go to avoid his persecutions. That BLAZES! IT'S A WHOPPER. 139 is my
                secret. Let it suffice. You say you witnessed his in- trusion-and although you did
                not interpose in my behalf, yet you sought an explanation of him, and offered him
                combat. You have an'acknowledgment of my gratitude, although I could not have wished
                to see you imperil your life on my ac- count. Farewell. He will not be likely to
                divulge his own baseness, and there can be no reason why you should disclose the
                unhappy predicament in which I was involved for a brief interval." "Stay, Lucy! One
                moment more!" cried Edmund, seek- ing to detain her. "No, sir! I will say no more.
                And I must labor under the painful apprehension that what I have already uttered,
                may not be credited by you, since my truth was doubted once. Just at that moment a
                tremendous plunge in the bushes on the margin of the brook, followed by a great
                splash, ar- rested the attention of Lowe, and accelerated the retreating steps of
                Lucy. Blazes! But it's a whopper!" said Bill Dizzle, rising up, with a great frog
                struggling in the agonies of death on the point of his spear. "Ar. Lowe, Mr. Lowe!"
                he continued, "I followed him more nor a quarter o' a mile. See what lovely eyes
                he's got!" Lowe, frowning, strode away, laboring under the painful con- viction that
                he had both wronged and offended Lucy. She had left him almost in anger, certainly
                in affliction from the thought that he could -be capable of doubting the propriety
                of -her conduct. And she had not, and perhaps would not, inform him of the place of
                her future abode. "Mr. Lowe," persisted Dizzle, following him, "I came to hunt you,
                when I found the frog. I come to tell you all about Mr. Roland's being flung by his
                horse- "Hah!" exclaimed Lowe, his ear attracted by the name of Roland. He listened
                attentively to Dizzle's narration, and was then moving forward again without
                uttering any remark on the occurrence, when Dizzle proceeded to add the substance of
                what he overheard in the conversation between Roland and the Quaker, for he had
                lingered near the door. "No matter. I fear him not," said Lowe; f" but I thank you,

                "O THE WINKLES. "I'll try not, sir; but I'm bound to vote for him." "Why are you
                bound to vote for him? I supposed it was only in monarchical governments where
                landlords exercised such control over their tenants. This is a land'of liberty, and
                he is a democrat." "All I know is, if I don't vote for him, my sister will be turned
                out of her cabin. She told me so herself. But I don't like the way he talked
                to-day." "It matters not-to me," said Lowe, tirning aside, and leaping across the
                brook, leaving Dizzle to stare after him, and at his frog, alternately. The unhappy
                man shut himself up in his chamber, a prey to many painful meditations. But,
                resolved to rend asunder the cloud which enveloped him, he started up after sitting
                for more than an hour in deep reflection, and crossed over to Mrs. Winkle's mansion
                to seek another interview with Lucy. Hav- ing obtained admittance into the hall, he
                learned from Biddy Boggle that her " missus " was engaged with a Mr. Parke, a friend
                of Walter's. And in confirmation of the statement,' he heard Lucy's voice, repeating
                the song which had produced such a sensation at her uncle's party. Passing by the
                parlor door, he sought Mrs. Winkle, whom he found in her usual sit- ting-room. She
                received him with her accustomed smile. "Sit down, Mr. Lowe. Lucy has informed me of
                your interview at the brook, and that you are acquainted with the fact of her having
                been captured by the enemy last night." "It is really so,.madam. And I came here to
                entreat her pardon for the obtuseness-I will not call it doubt-which restrained me
                from making an attempt to rescue her. I Most humbly do I beg her pardon; and you
                will please inform her of my contrition, and humble petition to be forgiven, if she
                should persist in prolonging my banishment from her pre- sence." "Certainly, sir-and
                I can, besides, assure her that there was a serious earnestness in your aspect and
                manner. But Lucy intends to banish herself." "And she has declined imparting to me
                the place chosen for her seclusion. Perhaps you will be kind enough to inform me?"
                "No. I must not interfere. She may have good and sufficient reasons for declining.
                You have had your mystery -now she has hers. There should be none on either side--
                FAIR PLAY. 141 but one will counterpoise the other. Love's comedy of strata- gems! I
                must not interpose to disarrange your plots-only I can warn you that woman's wit is
                the keenest. Lucy and I have a perfect understanding .with each other. She is never
                to marry without my concurrence, and I am never to attempt to impose on her any
                choice of mine, contrary to her wishes. But I may say, so far as we can see and
                know, that is, if there -be nothing hidden to create obstacles-it is my opinion that
                Mr. Lowe, if he should resolutely continue the pursuit, may win the race. But Mr.
                Lowe must choose his own time to make the requisite explanations, and Miss Lucy must
                enjoy the same privilege. That is fair, in love. Well? Who's there?" she, continued,
                addressing Biddy, who appeared at the door. "Biz-Diz-Dill Bizzle, mam." "Here,
                Biddy, give him this note. It is for Walter. Tell him to be sure and see him." "Yes,
                mam." "Walter has forgotten the friends who accompanied him from the city."- "And
                Lucy, I presume, is entertaining one of them during her brother's absence." "True.
                It is a sister's duty. And if he should fall in love, it will be no fault of hers."
                "You mean if he should not," said Lowe, smiling faintly. "-Poets and novelists would
                persuade the world that such is the character of the sex. It has been a wonder to
                me, if they possessed such an accurate knowledge of our dispositions, why they are
                not generally more fortunate in the selections they make themselves. But is not Lucy
                free " "Oh, certainly." "Then, until the irrevocable words are spoken, take a
                woman's advice and eschew jealousy. And, really, if Lucy should fortunately meet any
                one preferable to yourself in her estimation, she must be at liberty to embrace
                him-I mean to listen to his offer, to hear his account of himself, etc." "Oh, yes!"
                Well, why sigh about it? But for the purpose of miti- gating your despair, I suppose
                I may be permitted to say that the place which has been selected for Lucy's abode,
                is not one where it is at all probable she will meet many strangers." "It is a
                relief to know that," said Lowe. "I suppose, Mrs. <pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6922-00000077"/> "2 THE WINKLES. Winkle," he
                added, when rising to depart, "Lucy informed you that I had sought a meeting with
                Roland, and that the result merely exposed his pusillanimity. He threatened to
                denounce me as a highwayman. I do not fear it. Nor do I fear he will seek to injure
                Lucy's character. Hence the oc- currence of last night may be easily suppressed."
                "Roland has written me an apologizing letter. He admits his madness-but says it is
                the result of love." "Preserve his letter. He is a villain. His conduct made me
                forget myself and offer him combat. I do not think I could again be provoked to
                repeat such an indiscretion, and I fear my conduct on' that occasion is not approved
                by Lucy. Nothing short of defending her honor, could induce me to en- gage in mortal
                strife with an enemy, in a country where there are laws to vindicate the injured."
                Lowe departed. CHAPTER XIV. THE BRIDE TAKING POSSESSION-MSS WILSOME WINKLE RESOLVES
                TO MARRY. WALTER, after the amusements of the night, slept rather later than usual;
                and upon making his appearance in the breakfast room, he learned that his uncle and
                aunt had taken their re- past an hour before. But the thoughtful Griselda had kept
                his coffee hot. It was just when his. breakfast was finished, that Walter espied
                outside of a window about half of the weather-beaten and war-worn face of Sergeant
                Blore. His, eye was rolling in great excitement, and he secretly beckoned the young
                man to approach. When Walter joined the sergeant, the latter led him into a sentry
                box in the vicinity, and cautioned him not to speak loudly, or make any noise that
                might attract attention. "What is it?" asked Walter, in a whisper. "The emperor has
                almost abdicated," said Blore, in dis- tressful accents, while his eye was moistened
                with a tear. A CAPITULATION. 143 "They call it a treaty--but it is an abdication. I
                was com- pelled to sign as a witness." "What is all this? What have you signed?" "A
                capitulation!" continued Blore--" the most humiliat- ing and disgraceful terms!"
                "Explain, sergeant, explain." After many lamentations, the sergeant informed Walter
                that his uncle had been attacked early in the morning, by the housekeeper and cook,
                and had fallen back discomfited on his wife, who undertook to afford him security
                and protection on certain conditions, which had been agreed to, written down, and
                signed. They were substantially as follows: Mrs. Winkle was to have the purse-Mr.
                Winkle the sword. In all civil affairs, she was to be supreme-in all military
                matters he to be the head. And in pursuance of this convention, the keys -of the
                treasury were placed in the custody of Mrs. Winkle who could at any time discharge
                the garrison, by withholding the pay and rations! The sergeant, however, foreseeing
                the possibility of such a contingency, and with a single eye to his own interests,
                had caused an article to be inserted, that his name should be retained on the
                pension list during the con- tinuance of his mortal life. "Three cheers for Gusset!"
                said Walter. "No I Hush!" said Blore, placing his hand on the young man's mouth.
                "She might take umbrage, and I tell you she is the absolute mistress of the
                establishment. She will be a tyrant-another Catharine. I know a vixen when I see
                her. Let me tell you a secret. I was married once, and thought some time or other to
                marry again-but I won't! No! I would rather lose the rest of my limbs. You know Mrs.
                Ed- wards?" "Lowe's scolding old housekeeper?" "She! That she wolf! I intended to
                marry her, as a sort of companion for your uncle's spouse. My first wife was a
                scold--a tigress. Mrs. Edwards loved frogs, and as our tastes were alike, I. thought
                we might agree together. I paid her a visit, and what do you think 2 " "I think it a
                wonder she didn't bite off your nose. But I believe she has no teeth. Didn't she
                explode like a bomb?" "No-she screamed, and tried to throw her arms around me!" <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6922-00000078"/>
                ^144 THE WINKLES. "What-the first visit?" "She had seen me a thousand times before I
                Mrs. Ed- wards," continued the sergeant, in a very low whisper, "was Mrs. Blore!"
                "Your own wife?" True-as I was at Waterloo! I thought her dead-and as my Maker can
                witness, I hoped so. She thought the same of me, and I have no doubt, hoped the
                same. One half of me was shot away, and I was reported dead. She married again, and
                her second husband was drowned. instead of hanged." a"I would have given something
                to have been present at the meeting," said Walter. 'Oh, I fell down and begged for
                quarter, which she granted, on condition of a certain indemnity---- "Wherefore? You
                were going to marry her as Mrs. Ed- wards--hy not take her as your own wife?" "I

                since the emperor's escape from Elba!" "But you shall keep your money. I will not
                have it. Enough of these family affairs. I want to try my uncle, I hope he may be
                reformed, for the doctors say an excessive in- dulgence in such hallucinations may
                terminate in confirmed insanity. I am curious to know to what extent he can be
                influenced by his wife. Have you had the mortar I sent up put in the boat" . "Yes,
                and the bombs, too. All is ready. Shall we make the bull bellow .!" "Yes. But how

                on one side of the Channel." "Then go about it. I will be with my uncle in his cabi-
                net when the messenger arrives." When Walter joined his uncle, the latter was
                finishing the perusal of Alison's account of the camp at Boulogne. He closed the
                book with a sigh, and said: "I fear the days of glory are over. What a spectacle it
                must have been, to see such an array of military strength assembled in view of the
                cliffs of England! And the pro- found dissimulation of that unequalled genius! No
                one sus- pecting the point Were the blow would fall! All supposing it was really his
                intention to imitate Caesar in a descent upon the coast!" "' His was undoubtedly the
                greatest genius the world ever produced," said Walter. "True, Walter; and I have
                often sat upon my horse and fancied I saw how his victories were won, and enjoyed
                his triumphs. But I fear I have indulged too much in such mere fancies. Griselda
                says so-and she says, moreover, the people insinuate that my mind is partially
                deranged. It is not so. Nevertheless, my own people act sometimes as if I were an
                idiot, and would suffer any indignity. Think of their rude- ness last night I My
                wedding night! But your aunt shall punish them as. they deserve. She is a sensible
                woman, Walter; be kind to her. I have placed great power in her hands." "She and I
                were always good friends, uncle. But, sir, have you seen the mortar I sent you?"
                "Not yet; I ordered it to be put in the gunboat cruising in the Channel, and did
                intend to go on board before break- fast. But you know how I was disturbed last
                night, and I slept later this morning than usual. Griselda, though, was up before
                the lark, and wheedled me out of my purpose. What brought you here?" he continued,
                addressing Blore's messenger, who came bowing into the room. "The bull is bellowing,
                sir, with his face towards the cmp, and he's pawing up the ground, and lashing about
                with his tail." "I'll got Tell Blore to man the gunboat. Come, Walter, we'll have

                cruise in the Channel, and a few shots at ohn Bull." Walter followed his uncle into
                the orchard, and in the di- ection of the camp of Boulogne. When they entered the
                farrison, they were hailed by enthusiastic huzzas, and Walter aw the red flannel (it
                was a shirt) which had exasperated the lull, thrust quickly under a gun. The
                provocation removed, Johnny returned quietly to his Drowsing, notwithstanding the
                presence of his chiefest enemy. 'hen the old commander and Walter, followed by the
                allotted rew, entered the gunboat, in which the mortar had been laced, and began to
                cruise in the ChanndA. Every now and hen the mortar was discharged, throwing wooden
                balls which lad been picked up in dilapidated ten-pin alleys. They were yatched in
                their courses, and marked where they fell, to be ised again. Walter and the sergeant
                had likewise prepared I ?ome bags of sand, with powder and fuses, to explode in the
                dir. Thus they amused themselves, until the gunner, neglecting ;o elevate the piece
                sufficiently, one of the balls taking a horizontal direction, struck the orchard
                fence at a weak point md prostrated it. Immediately the whole herd of cows and ;iddy
                heifers passed through the breach and ran down to the margin of the water, while the
                old bull, on the opposite side )f the Channel, lifted his head and muttered
                something deep and low, which they seemed to understand, although it was
                incomprehensible to the men. But they were soon made to understand the meaning of
                such communication, for the cattle, after slaking their thirst, plunged forward and
                swam over to the green island. "Treason! cried Napoleon-- they are going over to the
                enemy I Fire at the bull, and row ahead of the deserters!" He was obeyed. A sand-bag
                bomb exploded over the head of Johnny, but did not seem to intimidate him. He ran
                into the water and drove back the boat, the oarsmen de- clining a collision with
                him, and enabled the cows and heifers 1 to land without further opposition; and when
                upon his terri- tory they evinced much joy by playful gambols and fantastic feats of
                agility. * In vain did the men endeavor to effect a laniing at the various
                accessible points. No sooner did they approach the soil, than the bull charged them,
                and drove them back into the a AN OLD ENElMYT . waves. Once he succeeded in getting
                one of his feet in the boat, and came near sinking it. Atanother time he toreoff a
                portion of the gunwale with his horn, and caused such a body of water to flow in,
                that the powder was spoilt, and of course the gun was silenced. Then the men were,
                ordered to with- draw from the hostile coast. But the enemy, not satisfied with
                repelling the assailants, pursued them in terror. The blood ofthe bull wasup. H
                plunged forward with the determination to annihilate his tormentors. "Row! I row!"
                cried Napoleon, "orwe shall be drowned." The oarsmen required no peremptory order to
                exert them. selves. The case was an urgent one, and they had quite as much at stake
                as their commander. They plied themselves therefore, with all their powers of
                propulsion, and steered for the battery, from which discharges were fired in quick
                succes- sion at the undaunted pursuers. "Put in ball! fire metal " cried Napoleon.
                But they had no balls, fortunately, for they might have shattered the boat to atoms,
                and involved friends and foes in one common fate. Asitwasthe burning wadding of the
                cannon fell in the boat, and would certainly have ignited the powder, and blown them
                up, ad it notl been dissolved in the water. At length, when the boat approached the
                muzzles of the guns, the bull curved gracefully round and swam back to the cows and
                heifers, and just as they began to exhibit ymptoms a dsposition to follow him. When
                the discomfited party sprang out upon land, Wal- ter was met by the faithful
                messenger, Bill Dizzle, and re ceived the note sent by her mother. He stepped apart

                who had been watch- ing and listening. Certainly-servants. Are not wages paid you
                for per- forming certain services?" A ROW AMONG THE "HELP." 149 "I never before
                heard any body in this house called a ser- vant I " said the housekeeper.. "Nor
                Inother! i won't be called one!" said the coo, exhibiting her bust a moment, propped
                by her arms akimbo, and then disappearing, and retreating towards the kitchen,
                slamming all the doors after her. "Who was that?" demanded the pale imperturbable
                Griselda. "The cook. But she'll cook no more in this house, if she's to be called a
                servant. If you want her to stay, you'd better take back your words, and apologize.
                I won't stay either, if you don't apologize to me. Nobody will stay to be called a
                servant, by one who was once an apprentice, and afterwards a milliner, who done her
                own cleaning, and emptying and filling! You should recollect that, mam, if you want
                to live pleasantly in this house." "Mrs. Acrid," said Griselda, her white lips
                quivering, and at the same time holding her purse with difficulty in her trem- bling
                hand-" what wages do you receive?" "I get compensation, mam--sometimes they call it
                salary. The last time I threatened to leave, Mr. Winkle put it up from eight to ten
                dollars a month. He soon found he couldn't do without me!" "Here are ten dollars

                awaiting my orders. If you make any disturbance, or refuse to obey, I will have you
                arrested and sent to prison." "Me? sent to prison?" "Yes, you-for stealing your
                master's spoons. The rob- bery last year has been traced to you, instead of the
                soldiers. Do you recollect a certain Abraham Laban, a Jew?" "Lord 'ave mercy on me '
                " cried Mrs. Acrid, falling down oner knees. Oh, mam, have pity on a poor old
                helpless woman, and save her from disgrace!" If you depart peaceably, you shall not

                you shall answer for all your thefts. There is an eye upon you. You are watched."
                Then Griselda descended to the kitchen, where she found the cook tossing the pots
                and pans about in most reckless con- fusion. "Well, cook," said she, smiling
                sardonically, "I have finished with the housekeeper. I must now have an under.
                standing with you." "That's not my name!" said the cook, whirling round and facing
                Griselda with a fierceness designed for intimidation. "What is your name? "Amanda
                Ann." "Very well. But why do you keep the kitchen in such bad order? The floor is
                covered with litter and filthy rags, and none of the vessels are clean. All the tin

                came meddling with my business. I won't stand it! You. may get somebody else that

                eat chickens, he may fast." "I shall do no such thing!" "I will, then!" and
                Griselda, snatched up the tongs and cast the frogs into the slop barrel. "Here are
                your wages," she continued. "You must leave immediately. After hear- ing your
                impudence, and ruining the condition of things in this place, I would not for the
                world eat a dinner of your cooking." "My cooking! You! You, who have lived on potato
                pair- ings and tripe 1" "Go! Mr. Buck the constable is waiting in the next room. A
                CHANGE OF SERVANTS. 151 If you do not depart quietly, I will make him arrest you for
                stealing your master's chickens. You can no longer sell the poultry, and subsist the
                rest on frogs. Mr. Buck says you have been sending him chickens and butter for
                several years- and he thought Mr. Winkle had the money. I could send you to the
                penitentiary." "I beg pardon, mam! Don't have me taken up, if you please! I'll do
                any thing you want me!" "Then leave the premises in ten minutes." Griselda had no
                Mr.. Buck in the next room; but she had held several conferences with that astute
                functionary before her marriage, and had obtained valuable information from him. He
                had been her next door neighbor, and promised very readily to become an auxiliary.
                He was from the land of steady habits and the clime of keen perceptions. The bride's
                antecedents he would know nothing about, if her future could be made advantageous to
                himself. But if there was no Mr. Buck in the next room, there was a housekeeper and
                a cook of Griselda's own choosing, whom she had provided for such a contingency as
                had just happened. She now joined them and related what had occurred, to
                theirinfinitd satisfaction. And when the old domestics had departed, with their
                trunks pre- ceding them in a cart, the creatures of the mistress emerged from their
                hiding-place in great glee, and entered with alacrity upon the discharge of their
                duties. Then Griselda retired to her chamber and arrayed herself in one of the
                splendid and costly dresses she had secretly pro- vided for such an occasion. Little
                did Miss Wilsome Winkle suppose, when she slighted the retired milliner, in the
                fashion- able street of Philadelphia, that the pale creature, humble and obscure as
                she seemed, was at that moment meditating one of the most lofty triumphs of woman's
                ambition. Long before that day had the quiet milliner designed to become the bride
                of Napoleon Winkle. She had studied his character, and as- certained that the
                accomplishment of such a project was easily practicable. Therefore, having every
                thing in readiness, the demure Gusset, when so unceremoniously dismissed, as she in-
                terpreted it, from the mansion of the rich and aristocratic old maid, walked
                deliberately forth, with the firm purpose of hav- ing the wedding consummated
                without further delay. And it was a matter of secret exultation that she was enabled
                to settle <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6922-00000082"/> 152 THE WINKLES. the matter definitively the very next day,
                and that, too, almost in the presence of the high-bred Wilsome. Of course the
                retired milliner had not forgotten any of the requisite adornments of the bride. It
                had been her vocation to furnish the most beautiful habiliments for others, and
                there could be no reason why she should not provide fitting apparel for herself.
                Hence, not only her wedding garments, but her second and third day dresses, were all
                in readiness before the time was settled for the nuptials. When Griselda descended
                to the hall, she was met by her husband and Walter. "My beautiful bride!" exclaimed
                Napoleon, "I must have a salute at parting, for I see the coach is awaiting you."
                "How you are bespattered with mud!" said Griselda, after receiving the kiss, and
                glancing at the soiled exterior of her lord. "The infernal Eng-no-my dear, the bull.
                He attempted to effect a landing, for the purpose of storming the batteries and
                spiking our cannon-but-but did not succeed. When will you return " "To dinner, at
                four o'clock. I must hasten to explain to our friends why you have deemed it proper
                to dispense with the ordinary etiquette---" 1 "Do. Say it was my will-and that I
                preferred the so- ciety of my wife to a mob of other people's wives and daugh- ters.
                Will you not take Walter with you? He has been sent for by his mother, and must go,
                I suppose, although I shall miss him." The chief then bowed with dignity, and strode
                into his cabinet, while Walter conducted his aunt to the carriage, which he was
                surprised to find had been furbished up exceedingly. The horses, four blacks, were
                in glittering harness, and the coachman wore a hathand of gold lace, and large
                silver buttons on his coat. "This is comfortable, Gus-" began Walter. "Gusset no
                more, Walter," replied she quickly, placing her magnificent fan against his lips.
                "But it is comfortable, as I intended it should be. I will be comfortable and happy
                the balance of my days. And all those who have sneered at the humble Gusset, because
                she was once a milliner, shall see and feel my importance." "Don't put on airs,
                Gusset-when we are alone, you must GUSSET IN HER TRUE COLORS. 153 allow me to call
                you by your old familiar name. But don't hold your head too high in Aunt Wilsome's
                presence, or my mother's. The fortune uncle Napoleon has, you know, came from my
                grandfather, and should not be used as a means of piquing any of the family. We were
                of the aristocracy, Gus- set, and you know that you can have no such claims to con-
                sideration." "I am -as good as most of the proud people of Babbleton. They made
                their fortunes in the shop, or their parents did before them. Fortune is every
                thing, as I have observed all my life. And now my fortune is made." "Very true. But
                you should: be kind, charitable, and generous; and not make use of the power you
                derive from my uncle, to resent affronts given to the milliner." "I am old enough to
                know my duty, and shall have the resolution to perform it. I would be pleased to
                have the friendship of my husband's family; but I can scarce hope for it. Your uncle
                loves you as a son, and you have always been a pet of mine. You could do nothing to
                offend him, irrecon- cilably, and I would bear much from you. Yet, Walter, let me
                warn you not to join my enemies in their enterprises against me. Be my friend, and
                you will reap advantages from it. You may lose the friendship of your proud aunt in
                the city, but you will have mine. And rely upon it, as your enemy, you would have
                more to fear from me than her. BRe- collect that you are poor--- "Say no more about
                that!" replied Walter, angrily. "I have been thinking several times of the
                consequences of this marriage, and am just beginning to realize them. I have been
                too thoughtless. Why did you wish to marry my uncle? You, an old maid, and he an old
                man I If I had had my wits about me, I should have prevented it!" "You might have
                prevented it. You are the only one who could have prevented it. But my wit was the
                most avail- able. Let i now understand each other, and act in concert. I know your
                power with your uncle, and you know mine. You might produce discord, but hardly a
                separation. I might pro- cure your banishment, but it would alienate the affection
                of my husband." "There need be no difficulty. You have only to be kind and
                respectful to our family. My mother always liked you- but she never dreamed you
                ambitious or vindictive. There 7* <pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6922-00000083"/> 154 THE WINKLES. will be no change in us,
                unless there is in you. But you must not restrain my uncle unreasonably-that is, you
                must i not seek to balk his good intentions towards his family. y Act thus, and you
                may be happy, and we contented." "It will be a hard task. However, I shall not be
                the first to commence hostilities. But I will put up with nothing from the rest,
                that I can put down." "A pun, Gusset. But here we are, entering the town, with the
                whole population staring at us. Where will you stop first?-at our house " "No. At
                the Arums. Mrs. Arum was at your uncle's mansion-your motltr did not come." "The
                deuce "I "It is not to resent your mother's absence-but to gratify the Arums. Before
                we part, Walter, I have one thing fur- ther to say. Previous to my marriage, Mr.
                Roland did every thing he could to accomplish my wishes. In return, I never omitted
                an opportunity of recommending him to Lucy. Whatever may occur between them
                hereafter, always remem- ber I had in view nothing but what I deemed an honorable
                and advantageous match. I used Roland as one of my instru- ments, while he vainly
                supposed I was an instrument of his. I believe now, that he has no idea of
                matrimony; and if what I have heard be true, he is a bad man-a dangerous man-and I
                feel it my duty to warn you against him. Lucy needs no warning, for she always
                disliked him. I shall cut him, and defy his worst. He may say he helped to make the
                match-but I shall laugh at the boast, knowing it will never reach the ears of your
                uncle." Walter then sprang out and hastened to his mother's man. sihn, while the
                proud dame descended in all her glory at the door of the Arums, which was thrown
                open to receive her. Mrs. Arum embraced the now great lady. A week before, she would
                not have been seen speaking to her in public Her daughters were entertaining Mr.
                Snobson lth all their might at the piano, playing and singing, while Mr. S. leaned
                upon the corner of the instrument in a trance. But all of them surrounded Mrs.
                Griselda in the parlor, and uttered felicitations. Mr. Snobson inquired after Miss
                Lucy, who, he said, had created quite a sensation with her voice, and might do well
                on the stage. If she had any dispo- sition to make a fortune in that way, he thought
                he had infu- TRIUMPHANT PROCESSION. 155 ence sufficient to procure her an
                engagement, and interest enough with the press to secure'her a fine reception. Do
                you mean Lucy Winkle?" asked Griselda, who still entertained the most friendly
                feelings for her husband's niece. "I heard she was poor, and I thought it a pity for
                one of her thrilling powers of voice to remain in obscurity. She is not so perfect
                as some I know in her performance," he con- tinued, with a significant glance at the
                pleased sisters; " but she sings with effect. It is a pity she is not in society."
                Griselda made no reply to the coxcomb, but answered the shower of questions asked by
                the admiring ladies, who were in high delight upon learning that the bride had done
                them the honor to pay them the first visit. After mutually ex- hausting their
                vocabulary of endearing epithets, Griselda arose, and was assisted into her coach by
                no less an attendant than Mr. Snobson himself, amidst the admiring gaze of the
                people in the street, and the sarcasms of the neighbors peep- ing from the windows.
                The parentage and wealth of Snobson being already known in the village, it was no
                small distinction for the retired milliner to be waited on by him. The next place at
                which the coach stopped was in front of the Crudle mansion. Here, too, a rapturous
                greeting was received by the bride. The old lady and her daughters, who had been
                expecting the visitor, ran down the marble steps and assisted Griselda to descend,
                while Mr. Fibber, whose shop was in the vicinity, held open the door of the coach.
                Fibber had once refused to credit Gusset for a few yards of dimity- but this was
                Mrs. Winkle, the spouse of one of the largest landed proprietors in the country.
                "We've been playing all the morning for Mr. Parke" said Miss Susan, when they were
                seated in the parlor. "We think him a delightful young gentleman," said Miss Sally.
                "He's altogether of a different cast from Snobson," said Mrs. Grudle; " for I've
                heard my husband say that old Snob- son, the father of this young man, used to run
                about the streets shaving the paper of merchants for the capitalists, and received a
                commission for performing thedirty work;'. Snob- son had neglected the Crudles. "I
                thought Virginia Oakdale would have been at your delicious party," said Miss Suaan.

                "but I did not hint what was going to happen." "Oh, then she wasn't invited!" said
                Miss Sally, tossing her curls aside. "But do you think she is to be married to,
                Walter Winkle, now?" "I did not know they were ever engaged," said Griselda,
                suggestively. "Nobody knew it," said the other; " but every body sus- pected it. Of
                course it can't take place now, since he has no prospect of a fortune." "And then,
                poor Lucy," said her sister, " what will become of her? Mr. Roland, I am sure, never
                had any serious inten- tion of marrying her. And as for the stranger, Mr. Lowe, I
                hope she won't be fool enough to throw herself away on one who may be, for what any
                body knows to the contrary, a refu- gee from justice." "Fugitive, my child." said
                her mother. Griselda really possessed a superior mind to the rich par- venues who
                had long looked down upon her with disdain, and she was not slow to perceive, being
                now elevated to their level in the estimation of the world, that no difficult task
                would be imposed on her in the maintenance of her new position. She drove next to
                the widow Winkle's, and was receied in the usual manner. There may have been more
                than usual interest evinced in her reception, but there was no bustle, no parade, no
                adulation.. Colonel Oakdale and young Parke were in the parlor, and they uttered
                their congratulations without irony, and without the warmth of expression which
                seeks to win the favor of a great personage. Griselda now felt that she was-in the
                pre- sence of her superiors, and sought to make no display. She even looked with
                pain, at the fine clothes she wore, and which had so completely dazzled the Arums
                and -the Crudles. No one asked her the price paid for her jewels, no one lauded the
                imposing ostentation of her equipage. On the contrary, when Walter came in from the
                post-office with a letter in his hand, the bride ceased to share the atten- tion of
                the company. "Why do you sUpile, Walter?" asked the widow, seeing her son was
                amused. "I have a letter from Aunt Wilsome-a characteristic one, and that, you know,
                would make any body laugh." ANOTHER MARRIAGE DEBATED. 157 "I hope it contains no
                secrets," said the colonel, "so that I may have the pleasure of hearing it read."
                "But it does, though," said Walter, and must not be read in public, at least a
                portion of it." Griselda, supposing that her wedding would be referred to in no
                flattering terms by the old maid, cast an imploring look at Walter, who understood
                its meaning. "Since it has become fashionable for old bucks of my years to marry,"
                said the colonel, winking at Griselda," I think I must fall in too. And I don't know
                a better match for me than Miss Wilsome Winkle." After the laughter which followed
                the serious expressions of the colonel, while delivering his speech, had subsided,
                Wall,. remarked that he was very sorry the colonel had not announced his intention a
                few days sooner. "Why so, sir?" demanded the colonel. "Is your aunt so beset with
                admirers that a few days sooner or later can make any difference in one's
                prospects?" "I am sorry to say they can. My aunt has selected another." "Walter!"
                cried his mother and sister. "It is true. She is to be married; she says so herself,
                and does not impose secrecy on me." After this announcement Griselda departed, and
                was con- ducted to the carriage by the gallant colonel, who, however, returned to
                speak with Walter. "Are you really serious?" he asked, on re-entering, and seeing
                the widow and Lucy eagerly perusing the letter. "Never more so in my life, I assure
                you. And now that my other aunt has left us, perhaps my mother will not object to
                having the letter read aloud for the entertainment of the company." "By no means,
                Walter," said the widow. "But it is true, sir; she announces her purpose of
                marrying." ' I am sorry for it upon my life," said the colonel, "for I hoped her
                fortune without obstruction or encumbrance would descend to Walter and his sister.
                Surely the old folks are as mad as Napoleon Winklon Wine's bull. When do you
                visitthe city, Tomorrow, ir." "To-morrow, sir." "Then bring home Virginia. Tell her

                158 THE WINKLES. the great meeting. I will have all the rich men of the county
                there, and we'll see if we can't surfeit these fierce re. formers. Good day." After
                the colonel had departed the widowand Lucy retired for a brief space to peruse the
                letter more carefully. It was truly a characteristic one. "Isolated," she said,
                "from all family connections, influences and endearments, by the late ill-assorted
                and most disgraceful match, which I alone de- nounced, there is no other alternative
                but for me to establish new connections, and to seek other associates, who will
                better appreciate the importance of family standing, and more rigidly conform to the
                rules and requirements of good society. I shall therefore turn my back upon all my
                kindred, and cease to know any of those who approved or sanctioned my brother's
                foolish marriage with that impudent hussy. My deceased brother, your noble father,
                had, I think, the largest share of my father's fortune, and I suppose your mother is
                amply pro- vided with money-although I don't pretend to know any thing about such
                matters. I can't tell what I possess myself, and never bother my head about it. I
                suppose if one has a fortune, and don't throw it away, it still remains. I have not
                thrown mine away, and never will. If your mother has dissipated hers, she was a fool
                for it, and should suffer for her folly. I hope the impudent Gusset will scatter her
                fraudu- lently acquired fortune, and so lead my silly brother Napoleon to
                repentance. I hope she will lead him by the nose. "If I see so plainly the
                imprudence of such disgraceful matches in others, you may suppose I shall be careful
                to avoid falling into the like silly practices myself. It is true I intend to marry.
                My nuptials will be celebrated some time during the present year. But the man of my
                choice will be a gentle- man of distinction-a genius of celebrity.. You know him,
                Walter-Mr. Pollen, the poet. If he is poor-if he has been sometimes, as you informed
                me, without a shirt-that is no disgrace. How was it with Chatterton, Defoe, and even
                Milton himself? And what lady in the world would not have been honored by being the
                wife of a Chatterton, a Defoe, a Milton? Shame upon the ladies who permitted them to
                languish in poverty 1 I will set an example for the wealthy ladies to follow
                hereafter. Genius is the very highest kind of aristocracy, because it cannot be
                conferred by mortal man, nor taken away even by the detracting tongue of women.
                Fare- A LETTER FROM WILSOME. 159 well. Present my adieus to your mother and Lucy. We
                will not meet again, unless it be- accidentally, and then it is probable there will
                be no recognition on my part, and I desire there shall be none on yours. You may say
                to Mr. Lowe that a visit from him would be agreeable to me I believe him to be a
                gentleman, and would have no objections to his society, if he could answer one or
                two questions satisfactorily. You may say to him that although I am resolved to
                marry, I don't expect to feel what the silly girls call a romantic passion for any
                man. I don't believe in any such nonsense. I want a partner at whist as much as any
                thing else. " And now, I care nothing for what the world may say. I despise the
                world, as a Christian should. "Your Aunt, "WILSOME WINKLE. "P. S. I have, since
                writing the above, received one of the most beseeching letters I ever read in my
                life from Ralf Ro- land. He begs me to conciliate Lucy in his behalf. Roland is
                rich, and may be a congressman. What does Lucy want? Tell her I approve the match.
                It is true Roland's father came- dangling around me when I was a simpering miss, and
                I believe my father kicked him out of doors. for some nonsense or other, I never
                knew exactly what, and was too young to understand the meaning at the time. But he
                was a fine per- sonable man, and rich-and I am sure your grandfather must have been
                difficult to please. It it true Roland was a rake- but any wife of spirit ought to
                be able to correct that.. It is besides a vice peculiar to the aristocracy. Tell
                Lucy, if she will be sociable with Roland, and hear my speeches in his favor, she
                may come to my house and remain as a favored niece until her decision is formed. If
                she marries Roland, she will afterwards have access to my society. If not, she can
                return and be henceforth a stranger. "Farewell, "W. W. "P. P.. While writing the
                last line, a decayed tooth in my under jaw broke off, and all the rest fell out. You
                see how they blotted the paper. I must go to the dentist and have the root

                accompany me. You will be my guest as formerly until I am done with you. " W. W."
                Mrs. Winkle laughed heartily at the letter, while' Lucy was vexed and thoughtful. In
                the parlor, George Parke was entertaining Walter with an account of Snobson's
                dereliction, which was inmpart owing to the deteriorating insinuations of the Arums
                and Crudles. "Lucy won't grieve. She saw to the bottom of his shal. low pate at a
                glance," said Walter. " But if he repeats any of the slanders of the Arums----" " He
                will be careful not -to do that," said Parke, " for he is continually hoping you
                will not take offence, and begging me to explain and apologize for him. But he is
                high in favor with the sisters. In their eagerness to captivate him, I saw them
                pouting and making mouths at each other.- No doubt when alone they pull each other's
                hair. Poor Snobson ! they'll sing him and talk him to death; and if they should
                require any assistance their mother will aid them. I don't think he can escape." a "
                I hope not," said Walter, seriously. " But how did the Crudles serve you ? " - " Oh,
                they found out that my grandfather was Vice Presi- dent of the United States, and my
                father a Senator in Con. gress, and they seemed to be enchanted. I was perfumed with
                their curls, dazzled with their diamonds, and ravished with the beauty of the worked
                borders of their petticoats, of which I had continued glimpses. They know exactly
                when I will graduate, and having unwittingly told them my age upon entering college,
                they have calculated how old I will be when I leave it." " Ha ! ha ! ha ! Poor
                fellow I " "I can't decide which is the most agreeable; and you know I can't have
                them both, unless I join the Mormons. Oh, you would laugh to hear them ridicule the
                Snobsons! Their own pa, they say, is vastly richer than the broker, and will some
                day do nothing but live on the interest * his money. Poor creatures ! They need not
                fear but they can have hus- bands. Their attractions will secure them lovers. I hope
                they may find honest men, who will take care of the wealth their enterprising father
                amassed in the shop." Walter's mother and sister interrupted the conversation at
                this point. And in reply to an inquiry from the former Walter announced his
                determination to visit the city that evening-not so much, as he confessed, to oblige
                his aunt, as to comply with the-order of Colonel Oakdale. And both he and George
                Parke set out for the city in the late boat. CHAPTER XV. WALTER'S CURIOUS QUARREL
                WITH VIRGIIA---A STROLL WITH THE POET-THE JEW-LOVE AND LAUGHTER-THE DENTIST. UPON
                reaching the city Walter and his young friend proceeded first to the residence of
                Dr. Nitre, as the most attractive point, and not doubting that Miss Wilsome would
                remain in tact until the former should find it convenient to wait upon her. The
                latter had determined to depart in the evening train for the college, where he
                learned there were letters awaiting him, and he desired to pay his respects to the
                young ladies before setting out. And Walter wished his attendance so that Julia
                might be entertained while he conferred with Vir- ginia, whose failure to write him
                as usual, and as had been agreed upon between them, rendered him apprehensive that
                something injurious to his interests had occurred during his absence. When they were
                ushered into the parlor, they found only the doctor and hisgood lady, who had just
                been, engaged in one of those little episodes in married life, called family uar-

                said the doctor, aside after heartily shaking the haads-of the young men. "No-no,
                doctor," continued 'she, "I want the young "Deuce take her," whispered Walter, " '

                "Just think of it 1" said she-"Here we have had Vir- ginia, I don't know how long,
                and no party-no visitors! And Dr. Nitre's practice worth five thousand dollars per
                annum No one visits us. No respect is paid to our niece, and simply because the
                doctor won't encourage people to come." My dear, I forget every thing else when
                treating my patients." "That's it! he confesses his culpable neglect. Don't you
                think it a great shame, Walter?" "No, upon my word I I am not at all sorry to hear
                Vir- ginia has been secluded from society." "I'll tell her I But you agree with me,
                don't you Mr. Parke?" ' I thought so! Now, Dr. Nitre-well! he's gone!"The doctor had
                slipped away, winking at Walter. "May we not have the pleasure of seeing the
                ladies?" asked Walter. "I hope they are at home." "Oh yes. Of course they are at
                home. They would never be guilty of paying the first visit! Did you come in your
                aunt's carriage. If so we'll have a nice moonlight drive, and make the doctor take
                his tea alone. No? I'm sorry for it. But we shall have a promenade. I'll send down
                the girls immediately." Shortly after Mrs. Nitre's departure Virginia and Julia
                appeared--the latter in gay spirits-the other rather grave. But as had been agreed
                upon between the young men, Julia' attention was at this time engrossed by the
                southern student, and Walter succeeded in detaching Virginia from her cousin. "I
                have not received a letter since we parted," said Wal- ter, in a low voice. "For the
                reason that it was not written," was replied promptly, if not pettishy. ' "But was
                there any goo reson for not writting I sure I wrote twice. I hope they were
                received." "They were received, sir. Here they are,unopened And she placed them in
                his hand. "Virginia I What have I done to deserve this? "Enough." "And will you not
                tell me?" "Have you not been in the habit of exhibiting my letters, and even giving
                them away?" A MYSTERY. 163 "No! Upon my soul, I have never been guilty of any such
                baseness." I suppose it would be denied. But what is a mere de- nial--" "I'll swear
                to it- " "No-don't! Pause. I say what- is a denial, or even an oath, against the
                evidence of one's own eyes?" "Your own eyes! Virginia--" "Call me Miss Oakdale, Mr.
                Winkle." "If any other person's eyes were to bear such testimony, I would pronounce
                them false, perfidious, perjured " "Stop, sir! We'll see. Another person's eyes
                shall bear witness with mine. I suppose you will believe your own eyes. Here," she
                continued, drawing another letter from her pocket -" here is one of my letters,
                which I received from the hands of a certain young lady, with whom I am informed you
                have but a slight acquaintance. Do you recognize it?" Walter gazed in utter
                astonishment at the familiar super- scription. "I would forswear my own eyes," said
                he, " if they alone beheld it. But, Virginia-" "Miss Oakdale, Mr. Winkle," she
                interposed. "But there is some mystery here, which must be explained. I never, so
                help me Heaven, gave that letter to any young lady, or to any one else. I thought it
                was locked up at home " "Oh yes! And you asserted that they were kept next to your
                heart!" "It must have been so! It must have dropped from my breast." "Then it was
                time to cease writing to so careless a cor- respondent. But there is n, proof th

                me to conduct you home." " He shall be obeyed. When do we set out?" "I can't say,
                until I see my aunt who sent for me." "If she sent for you, why did you come here
                first? "I loved you more than my duty---" "I believed you once." "And I wanted an
                explanation of the cause why you had not written." "You have it. Now go. I will
                explain to my aunt. She takes it for granted you will remain, and will insist upon
                it if she sees you again. When you are ready to return to Babble- ton call for
                me-not before." "Walter," said Parke, rising, and looking at his watch, "I must go,
                or the cars will leave me. I will, if possible, run down to the village next week to
                hear your speech." "And I should like to hear it," said Julia, exchanging glances
                with Parke. "You are to return with me, you know," said Virginia, "and aunt is to
                spend a week at Cape May." The young gentlemen departed, one for the depot, the
                other for the Winkle mansion. Walter was admitted just as his aunt and her
                affianced, Mr. Pollen, were siting down to tea. His aunt,dressed inher usual
                fantastical style, applauded his promptitude of obe- dience, and said she had not
                expected his arrival before the next morning. But she was glad to see so ready a
                response to her summons. Pollen greeted his young friend very cordially, and thanked
                him for the loan of his shirt, adding that he was now provided with an abundance of

                heartily. "Such incidents in the lives of men of genius," said' Wil. some," are the
                most interesting portions of their history. And I shall insist upon having your
                biography, dictated by your- self. I will hire an amanuensis for that purpose."
                Pollen bowed in grateful acknowledgment, and really con- sidered the words she had
                spoken, when he thought of the posi- tion and the wealth of the person uttering
                them, as one of the most felicitous speeches which had ever been addressed to him,
                and if such a thing had been possible, he would doubtless have fallen in love with
                her. "Employ me, aunt," said Walter. "I am idle, and want something to do. Indeed I
                must do something to make a living." "To make a living! Your father's fortune was
                ample. He couldn't take it with him. Pooh-nonsense-the Win- kles are rich.
                Nevertheless, if you should be competent, and would undertake the task--" "I will
                answer for my ability to do him justice," said Walter--" and my lively and
                discriminating aunt shall figure advantageously in the work. Oh, you shall be'handed
                down to posterity! "And she shall be!" said Pollen, his fine' pale face beam- ing
                with animation. "Authors are generally poor. They live in poverty, and die in
                destitution. Then the literary scavengers pick their rags from the gutter, and

                cities strove for Homer dead, Through which the living Homer begged his bread.'"
                Walter watched his aunt closely. There was a twinkle of the eye which portended a
                tear, and he had often heard it said ! that she was incapable of shedding one. She
                lifted her hand. kerchief with the utmost care, and applied it slightly to the lower
                lash, and above the paint. But the spasmodic quiver satisfied him that she was not
                devoid of noble emotions. "That speech," said Walter," shall be interpolated in the
                book." "I see you are laughing at me, Walter!" said his aunt.. "So, for fear that
                some of your own nonsense may be added, I shall look over the proof-sheets myself."
                "'Why, aunt, I understand they are to be his posthumous memoirs; and you can have no
                reasonable expectation of sur- viving him." "She may," said Pollen; " it would be no
                unreasonable expectation. I have seen my end. It is not in the distant future."
                "Pooh! Nonsense! Change the subject," said Miss Wilsome. "How dare you start such a
                dismal topic, Walter 2 Sip your tea sir, and then if nothing else occurs, we will
                have a rubber." "Not to-night, aunt. Mr. Pollen and I have an appoint- ment---" "So
                we have," said the poet, quickly. "But we will en- deavor to be back in time for a
                game." ' If you have an appointment, it must be kept," said Miss Wilsome, "and I
                presume it is not my privilege to demand the nature of it, or to suggest that it
                might be postponed." "It might be postponed," said Walter, "if I were not compelled
                to return to Babbleton before another night." "Why are you compelled to return?"
                asked his aunt. "Because I promised Col. Oakdale to conduct Virginia home to-morrow,
                if you did not see proper to detain me longer." "Perhaps I will see proper to do so.
                So you may be here "TH[OU ART THE MAN." 167 another night, if I desire it. But you
                will not take Virginia back with you." "Why, aunt?" "I won't tell you---ust now. I

                care of your hair, when you meet Virginia. I warn you against her talons. I could
                dispel the mystery, however, and enable you to explain satisfactorily. But if she
                laughed as heartily as I have done, there might be danger of a rupture of a
                blood-vessel." "Aunt!" said Walter, "I will remain, if--" "Go about your business! I
                don't believe you have any other engagement than a desire to smoke a cigar. Go-and
                make haste back." Pollen and Walter departed immediately, the latter won- dering
                what adventure and mystery his aunt had referred to, and if it had any connection
                with the origin of Virgini's dis- pleasure. "Do not be east down," said Pollen,
                supposing Walter's abstraction to proceed from the change in his prospects since the
                marriage of his uncle. "Your aunt has informed me of the ridiculous choice of your
                uncle, and of her displeasure, and determination to cast off every member of her
                family who failed to take umbrage at it i She has even expressed an intention to

                exclaimed Walter, in amazement. "Do you not know it will happen?" "I? Certainly not.
                All I know about it is, that she has expressed such a purpose several times. I was
                silent. I did not choose to manifest any dissent from such an idea, though I thought
                it strange, since she has taken me into her favor, that she never intimated who was
                to be the happy man." "Is it possible?" "It is as Htell you. Do you know him?" "Thou
                art the man!" said Walter, placing his hand on the poet's shoulder. "Me? No. It is a
                mistake." "It is no mistake. She has informed me of it herself. It is strange,
                however, that she should have withheld the infor- mation from you-you, who must
                certainly be as deeply inter- ested in the matter as any one. But you know the

                she believed I had merit, and because the rest of mankind had combined to sink me
                with their neg- lect. I deemed her brave in opposing the world, and nobly generous
                in assuming an object of odium, one with whom no human being sympathized, from
                despair and destruction. After all, her motive was merely to. obtain a husband!"
                "Men and women were. made to marry," said Walter. "There was no harm in that." "But
                women were not designed to marry their grandsons I However, it was never my design
                to be a permanent pen- sioner. I hoped to repay her favors, and hope so still. I am
                in her debt. She has satisfied my creditors; clothed and fed me. I owe her so many
                dollars, and perhaps some gratitude. Thank Heaven, hope is not extinct in my bosom,
                or else an im- penetrable darkness would prevail. I have two volumes ready for the
                press, and a single one ere this has repaired a man's fortune and made him an
                undying name. My name has been won. No earthly power can annihilate it. And if only
                ond or two of the daily papers would say what they honestly think of the merits of
                my works, there would be purchasers enough to lift me above the reach of the talons
                of want. If such a thing should happen, I will reimburse your aunt---" "No-you will
                do no such thing," said Walter. "She would not receive your money. She would deny
                that she ever expended any for your benefit. No doubt she has forgotten all about
                it. She is not mercenary--but she is Wilsome. If A VISIT TO THE JEW. 169 you break
                with her, she will abuse you-but she will never al- lude to any advances of money.
                On the contrary, if the rup- ture be not so violent as to make her forget she has a
                purse, it is quite likely that after denouncing you, she will share it with you, and
                then dismiss you with her curse." "I would rather have one's curses, for
                dissatisfaction with my person, my manners, my mere caprices-and if it be a lux- ury
                I have long enjoyed it-than bear the scorpion stings of just reproaches-reproaches
                for having perpetrated a decep. tion; or for having failed to recognize the claims
                of a son of genius, who perished from neglect, for---" "Pardon me for interrupting
                you, But whither do we go?" "Fate has led us towards the den of Abraham Laban, the
                Jew." "And we will enter and try our fortunes. We may know whether there be any good
                thing in store for us, from his anx- iety to rob us of the greater portion of it. If
                he be not disposed to treat with us-then, indeed, the prospect is gloomy. But
                Pollen, in regard to this curious aunt of mine, will you listen to reason?" " Yes-a
                little." "Then do not break with her abruptly. Do not absolutely decline her offers.
                Postpone the time of separation, if you cannot wed her, and must separate. She is
                enormously rich, and does not spend one tenth of her income. It could not be better
                bestowed than on you. Both gold and genius are given by our Maker, and the one
                should be subservient to the other. She may abuse you when you part, revile you when
                severed, but will never cease to luxuriate in the remembrance that she once
                entertained a poet under her roof. And the more she expends on you the happier will
                she be. It will be the most sensible expenditure she could make, and afford her the
                most satisfaction when she reflects upon it afterwards. She will never reckon the
                amount expended, and therefore my advice is that you do not .eglect the present
                opportunity of partaking of her liberality. Undoubtedly she will resent your
                abandonment of her; but rely upon it, she will never permit any one else to censure
                you. I know her well.. On the contrary she will denounce all her rich friends for
                not dividing their fortunes with you." "Walter! you almost persuade me to marry her.

                but the world, posterity, would attribute unworthy motives-and-I will not do it!
                That is my irreversible decision. But I will not break with her abruptly." "Enough.
                Now let us enter the Hebrew's infernal re. gions." They were admitted by the
                ministering young girl the Jew employed in the capacity of door-keeper, that she
                might seem to have an honest occupation. Abraham now bestowed the most of his
                cordiality on the poet, to his infinite surprise. "We come to have our fortunes
                told," said Walter, occu. pying, unbidden, a chair. "Told down, I suppose," said the
                Jew. "It is the way with all. It is astonishing that so many hundreds rely upon me
                for fortunes, and at the same time condemn me for my gains. Yet, how could I furnish
                so many with money, if I did not derive it from others? If I did not reap profits,
                my 'purse would soon be exhausted, and then the Jew could assist no one. Blind,
                ungrateful fools!" "And that's as true as any speech Shylock ever made. But Abraham,
                you were disposed a short time since to ad. vance me money on my bond." "'A short
                time since. Well, I was. But a short time after makes a great difference. At two
                o'clock a man is rich -at three a bankrupt. Your uncle marries. His wife will become
                his heir in the will she will cause him to sign. Your bond would be worthless."
                "Nevertheless, Abraham, you will acknowledge your pre- science was at fault. You
                might have been a loser by the operation." "I acknowledge no such thing." "You do
                not?" - "No. I would have forbidden the bans." "And what good would that have done "
                "I mean that the wedding would pot have taken place, unless it was a match decreed
                by the Jesuits. I rarely fail in my calculations. There would have been abundant
                means of preventing the marriage." I wish you had done so." "It is too late, now. It
                might have been better for us both, if you had borrowed money on your bond. I would

                in this instance he would have served the rightful heir. But no more. That account
                is closed." "And mine was never opened,"- said Pollen. "The time had not yet
                arrived," said the Jew, with a most conciliating smile. "It had, though!" said the
                poet. "You declined to treat for my poem. Since zthen, it has realized me some--
                some---- "Four hundred and twenty five dollars,' said the Jew. "How the d-1 did you
                know?" asked Pollen, quickly, for the computation was just. "No matter. It is my
                business to know. I will not ex- plain the means. To me the manuscript would have
                been worthless. Hence you see the importance of placing your productions in the
                proper hands. Every thing depends upon the disposition and influence of the party

                thing, my merits, my possessions and expectations, please name the utmost sum I may
                command, the terms to be dictated by yourself." "I have calculated it. Ten thousand
                dollars." "You take my breath!" Do you take the money," said Walter. "Out of your
                pocket?" asked the Jew. "My pocket?" said Walter, involuntarily thrusting his hand
                in it. Oh, yes. He is quite welcome to all he can find there." * Your terms? '
                demanded Pollen. "Two bonds. One for fifteen thousand dollars, due at the expiration
                of twelve months--" Without interest?" t"With interest from date-the legal interest,
                six per "Merciful Jew!" "No. Mercy, friendship, gratitude, are idle terms in mat-

                fifty thousand dollars, they sell to the amount of half-a-million. If they get ten
                per cent. profit on their sales, they receive eight per cent. per month on the
                capital in. vested. And yet they curse us, call us usurers, and pass i laws to
                prevent us, if possible, but which is not possible, from 1 reaping more than six per
                cent. on our investments!" "With the ten thousand, then, I might make twenty, and
                could afford to pay the bonus of five. I think I shall embrace the offer," said the
                poet. "But the other bond," said the Jew. "I forgot that. What is it like? Not a
                pound of flesh, I hope, Jew?" . w "No-but the whole heart. You must bind yourself to
                marry your young friend's aunt within five days, and you shall have my check payable
                the day after." "I'd see you -- first! I would rather marry the pretty girl you keep
                to admit customers taken in by you." "I have io more to say," replied the Jew,
                flushed with anger. ' But I warn you not to attempt to hold any conver- sation with
                that girl! You can have no business with her. Good night, gentlemen." The young men,
                thus summarily dismissed, revenged themselves by exchanging significant glances with
                the girl who unbarred the door for them, and who did not seem to be of- fended at
                the liberty they had taken. Walter, who was impatient for the solution of the
                mystery in which he was so unconsciously involved, prevailed on the poet to return
                to the Winkle mansion. "I thought you would soon return," said the pleased old lady,
                when they entered the brilliantly illuminated parlor. "One felt an irresistible
                curiosity to know my secret; and the other always finds my poor house sufficiently
                attractive." "Oh, yes," said Pollen, "a home fit for a prince; but I am merely a
                poet." "But nevertheless as welcome as a prince," said Wilsome, with a most gracious
                smile. "Now, aunt " said Walter. "Wait till one of the Points comes in. I have sent
                for Clara-the mischievous one." "The Points!" exclaimed Walter, recollecting the
                adven- ture of the night when he entered the Professor's house by WHO SQUEEZED MY
                HAND 173 mistake. "Pray don't send for her, aunt," said Walter. I have special
                reasons for it." "And I have stronger ones for doing what I wish She will make a

                lively and hand- some Clara glided into the room, and Walter was introduced to her.
                When bowing, and lifting her eyes, she affected to start, as if surprised. "Don't be

                reverting to the displeasure of Virginia. "The letter-I forgot the letter. It was
                found in the flour barrel." "Found in the flour barrel!" exclaimed Walter. "Found in
                the flour barrel!" repeated Clara, in a mock solemnity of tone. "A floury epistle,"
                said Pollen. "No one read it, however," said Clara. "We agreed among ourselves that
                its contents should be sacred. We merely looked at the signature, so that -we could

                amusement, but under a promise that all should be satisfactorily explained. I knew
                Virginia could be easily appeased. Sit still, sir; never mind your hat." '"Your
                letter did not fare so well,' continued Clara, ad- dressing Pollen. "Mine? I am not
                aware of having lost any." "It was no great loss, I fancy. But it is certain that
                when you threw your hat on my bed, a letter fell out of it." "Indeed! Let me
                remember. I believe I did receive a note that day from my-tailor! I hope you sent it
                back to the writer. I shall not be offended." Here it is," said Clara, who had slyly
                received it from Miss Wilsome. "Paid! Receipted! My dear Miss, you may have all my
                letters!" said Pollen, who knew perfectly well who had paid the bill. Agreed," said
                Clara. "But I cannot consent to receive them in the same manner, and at the same
                time and place." "My dear aunt," said Walter, rising, " do permit me to run down to
                Dr. Nitre's- " "Are you unwell? 2" asked Clara. "Pooh, child, she won't die before
                morning," replied his aunt, shuffling the cards. "And I'm sure she's in bed by this
                time, and perhaps asleep, and dreaming of you. The habit is fixed upon her-the
                abominable habit of retiring early, and AN EXPLANATION. 175 early rising, which she
                got from her father. He is out every morning before the sun is up, cruelly
                destroying the woodcock, or killing hte trout, which he finds in a small brook-a
                fish, Mr. Pollen. not much longer than your finger." "And what is your hour, aunt,
                for retiring?" "None in particular-but always after midnight. And I rise in the same
                way, any time after nine. Bring your mate. I am paired." They played until the game
                palled on their hands, for the victory, if it could be termed a victory when there
                was no con- test, was invariably on the side of Wilsome and the poet. "You must be
                deeply in love, Walter," said his aunt. "I never knew you to play so badly. It must
                be an affection of the heart which has obtused your head." "It would follow, then,"
                said Pollen, "that where the in- tellect is clear, there is no affection of the
                heart." Wilsome threw a glance of surprise at the poet, and felt that her shaft had
                rebounded. "Let him defend himself," said she. "No. I yield,"' said Walter. "Then
                take the captive with you," said his aunt, to Clara, who was departing. "I will,"
                was the response, " but I will not admit him within the door." "Oh, he finds access
                without your permission," said Pol- len, bowing, and withdrawing. The next morning
                Walter hastened to the mansion of Doctor Nitre, and met the doctor himself on the
                marble steps. "Iam glad to meet you here, my young friend," said the doctor, "and
                was, indeed, just going to your aunt's to see you. I have learned the cause of
                Virginia's umbrage-indeed I knew it yesterday, for it was confided to me by
                Professor Point -and I should have informed you of it, but I knew there was no
                danger of a serious estrangement, and " "I knew all about it, doctor," said Walter,
                impatient to enter. "If your conscience acquits you, for prolonging Vir- ginia's
                pain, I am sure I do." "But you have had your revenge, sir! I hve been pun- ished.
                Your abrupt departure last evening was attributed by Mrs. Nitre, to some misconduct
                of mine; I believe it was for leaving you to visit some poor languishing patient;
                and I as. sure you, in the strictest confidence, that I endured the <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6922-00000094"/>
                '1 o THE WINKLES. severest curtain lecture last night I ever listened to in all my
                life." " I am sorry to hear it, doctor." " And I am glad to find a sympathizer. Mrs.
                Nitre has been in an ill humor ever since. But the clouds will blow away, and the
                sun shine forth again, when she sees you. Good- bye-and good luck to you.'" Walter
                rang and was admitted. But before the servant had an opportunity to announce his
                name to Mrs. Nitre, he espied Virginia gliding into the parlor, and immediately
                joined her. She still wore a serious aspect, and there were visible traces of recent
                discomposure. But when the lover made a full confession of his night's frolic; of
                the encounter with the poet; the Jew's interview with the fortune hunters; the death
                of the monkey, and the adventure in the professor's house, the gloom vanished from
                the young lady's brow, and was succeeded by hearty and hilarious laughter. "In the
                name of wonder what is the matter with the girl!" exclaimed Mrs. Nitre, running in.
                Virginia was speechless from her cachinatory convulsions. " Only diverted at a
                little confession I have been making," said Walter. " Oh, you are here, my dear
                friend ! The stupid servant! I will discharge her! Not to inform me you had called.
                And-bless me ! I am in dishabille ! " she added, glancing at her morning wrapper and
                quickly vanishing. Before she returned, Walter had made his peace with Virginia, and
                de- parted. When he appeared again before his aunt, she could not avoid observing
                the change in his spirits and appearance and she listened with satisfaction to his
                narration of the proceed- ings at his uncle's mansion after the dispersion of the
                wedding guests. Being greatly diverted at the annoyance of Gusset, on whom, when her
                name was mentioned, she never failed to bestow a broadside of opprobrious epithets,
                she approved the conduct of Walter, and desired him to say to Sergeant Blore, that
                whenever he visited the city, her house would be open for his reception, and might
                be freely considered as his head- quarters. But she condemned Walter for riding in
                the coach with the "impudent hussy," and intimated that if he had quarrelled with
                her outright she might have become reconciled to him, and indeed might have deferred
                her own wedding to some distant period. "When is it to take place, aunt ?" he asked.
                " I have not fixed the day-but soon." " Is he impatient ? " He ? He don't know any
                thing about it yet !" was the prompt reply. "That is most extraordinary," said
                Walter. "I always thought it required two to make a match, unless, indeed, one may
                substitute a dummy." "None of your nonsense. A dummy husband might be very
                convenient, though, under certain circumstances I But mine shall be a man of genius;
                one looked up to by the world with admiration; one who can reply to the
                impertinences of frivolous tongues, in Greek; one who, when lifted above the fangs
                of poverty, and the sneers of tradespeople, will be uni- versally respected; and who
                will have justice done him by the press of the country, when it is known he is
                independent of their aid in the procurement of a subsistence. Surely I who can
                accomplish all these things for him, have the right to name the day and condition,
                and he must have too much dis- cernment to throw any obstacles in the way." .I
                suppose so, aunt; but I don't know. I have heard it said that Pollen once lost a
                fortune by refusing to yield to the caprices of a woman." "He did--he told me-so
                himself. But has he notsuf- feredforhis folly? Would he be likely to repeat such an
                indiscretion, with all his experience of the evils of abject destitution; I don't
                fear it. But come-let us go to the den. They drove to the gorgeously upholstered
                shop of the toothfiler, and were ushered ,into a saloon hung round with second-hand
                mirrors bouht at Moses's haberasherJr, and were invited to recline on the red
                cushions of the sofas. "I shall do no such thing," said Wilsome to the maid. I am
                never kept waiting any where. Tell Mr. Enamel that iss Wilsome Winkle desires to
                have his attention imme. liately. " "Mr. Enamel, miss," said the fine servant maid,
                " is in ew York, and will not return before evening; But Mr. Foil his friend from
                New York, and the fashionable dentist of that city, is here to-day to operate for
                him." <pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6922-00000095"/> 178 THE WINKLES. "He don't operate on me! Mr. Foil, indeed!
                No. My mouth is not open to every body! Tell Mr. Enamel, when he returns, to bring
                his instruments to my house, and perform the operation there. If he fails, I shall
                look for a more grate. ful dentist. I first saw this Enamel,' she continued to
                Walter, as they returned home, "several years ago, in church, when all the wealth he
                possessed was a fine suit of clothes, and a handsome face. The congregation was
                large and rich, which of course was the reason he joined them, and I aided him in
                extending his acquaintance. The minister recommended him to me, and I believe his
                large family to this day pay nothing for the dentist's services; and so Enamel's
                business increased most wonderfully. He has made a fortune, however, and is less
                accommodating than he used to be. But he shall accom- modate me." "Aunt," said
                Walter, "do you suppose there was any agreement between the minister and the
                dentist?" "Perhaps none specified. But like another class, so much abused, there are
                some clergymen the merest deadheads, who make merchandise of religion. While
                denouncing the mer. cenary spirit of the age, their own edifices, which they call
                churches, are the marts for the sale of all sorts of wares, and you never fail to
                hear the rattle of money in them. It would almost seem as if they bartered salvation
                for silver, and begged in the name of the Lord." "And that might be construed as
                taking the name of the Lord in vain---" "True, Walter. For sometimes, I doubt not,
                they beg in vain. If Enamel disappoints- me, to-morrow we will go to New York." "To
                New York, aunt?" "Certainly. Do not people go there every day There is nothing
                wonderful in it. Yes, I will go there, and be ope- rated on by some one who shall
                not learn my name, and where I dwell. I have my reasons for it." "Then I should not
                be able to return to Babbleton to- day." "Of course not." "And if Enamel comes, I
                shall not be permitted to spend the evening at Dr. Nitre's." "No. You are subject to
                my orders. But if you desire it, Virginia and Julia shall both come to my house."
                NATURE'S HANDIWORK. 179 "I do desire it, aunt." Virginia and Julia were. sent for
                immediately, and they dined at the Winkle mansion. In the evening a splendid
                equipage drove up to the door, and Dr. Enamel descended, and was conducted to the
                chamber which had been prepared for him, and where he was soon after joined by Miss
                Wilsome and Walter. Here Walter learned, for the first time, that his aunt's
                beautiful teeth he had been accustomed to admire, were all false, and that the roots
                of the one to be extracted, were the last remains of nature's handiwork. When her
                teeth were re- moved, Miss Wilsome's lips fell in, and her voice was sepul- chral.
                "If it gives you too much pain," said Enamel, when pre- paring to incise the gum, "
                you had better take a little ether. I have brought a bottle for that purpose."
                "Throw it out of the window!" said the old lady, now looking very old indeed. "I
                will have none of it. I shall never place myself in a condition to have my throat
                cut, and be a mere silent spectator, without the ability to resist. True, Walter is
                here, and would revenge me. Still, I won't relin- quish my own powers of resistance.
                Do your work as quickly as possible-I will bear the pain." She bore it like a
                heroine. She did not even wince under the infliction. But the root adhered so
                tenaciously to its -socket, that all the strength of Enamel was exerted to extract
                it. And in the struggle, he placed one of his hands on the head of his patient, and
                by an unlucky movement, the whole mass of dark glistening hair, which had often
                elicited the ad- miration of Walter, slipped aside and fell'to the floor, leaving
                his aunt's head as bald, and almost as smooth and white as an egg. "Give me my
                hair!" she cried, starting up, and ejecting the blood which followed the extraction
                of the root of the tooth. "How is this " demanded Walter, rising, and assuming a
                menacing attitude, for at first he supposed t4le dentist had by some process or
                other deprived his aunt of her natural adorn- ment. "It is only her wig," whispered
                Enamel.: "She has been bald fifteen years." "Wilsome replaced the hair, adjusting it

                passed by the door, which had been neglectfully left open. Thenshereplaced her
                teeth, without uttering a word. "I am sorry the accident happened," said Enamel.
                "You should have remembered that it happened once before," replied Wilsome, after a
                long silence. "It is not pleasant to be exposed thus, in the presence of witnesses.
                True, one is my nephew-but he knew nothing about it. And Pollen must be passing
                just. at that moment! L He was in a revery, aunt," said Walter, and incapable of
                observing external objects." "I hope so," said she. "That is all, sir," she
                continued to Enamel. "Tomorrow send me your bill, and I will sign a check. You know
                I will not permit my name to go on a dentist's books." Enamel bowed and withdrew,
                and the next minute his coach was heard rolling away. As Walter and his aunt
                proceeded towards the parlor, where the young ladies were engaged in some boisterous
                enter- tainment, many solemn injunctions of inviolable secrecy were imposed. The old
                lady declared, in the event of his betraying her, the estrangement which she had
                already decreed, would be changed to bitter enmity, without the benefit of truce, or
                an interlude of special friendly meeting, during the remainder of their lives. When
                they appeared in the parlor, it was ascertained that the poet had truly fallen into
                one of his fits of abstraction, and wandered away in the street, muttering
                incoherently, some- thing upon the subject of impartial criticism. Wilsome seemed
                annoyed. But Walter and Virginia realized a happy unoon sciousness of the vexations
                to which mortality is liable. CHAPTER XVI. FLIGHT OF LUCY FROM HER LOVERS-JOHN
                DOWLY'S VISIT TO THE WIDOW-BLORE'B LETTER. AT the village Roland attempted in vain
                to obtain an inter- view with Lucy. 'Repea tedly the effort was made; -and when A
                PROMSE. 181 he withdrew the last time, defeated and chagrined, and with malignant
                impulses struggling in his breast, he was met by Lowe-his despised rival-who was
                approaching the mansion. Lowe, always pale, but never more self-possessed,
                diminished his pace, and looking his enemy steadily in the eye, smiled derisively.
                Roland, disconcerted, and trembling with fear, cast down his eyes and strode past
                without uttering a word. Lowe was admitted, and a few moments after Lucy ap- peared
                before him, and occupied a seat at his side. And she began the conversation. "Mr.
                Lowe," said she, "I chanced to see your meeting with Roland in the street. You
                seemed prepared for a ren- contre. There was defiance on your lip, and vengeance in
                your heart." ' He is a coward-therefore I cannot attack him." "Heis dangerous,
                though cowardly, as you say. I would not, for the world, have any blood spilled on
                my account. Will you, for my sake, forbear?" ' Certainly. I never could desire to do
                him injury, except in my own defence, or yours." I shall withdraw from a place where
                it is necessary to have a defender. Will you promise, during my absence, not to come
                in hostile collision with Roland?" L "Most willingly, especially if the desire is at
                all prompted by a motive to save me from the effects of his evil machina- tions." "I
                would save you from his vengeance, which is not often balked in the victimization of
                its object. I would save him, too, from the consequences of your enmity. And I would
                save myself from the heart-rending reflection, that I had been the innocent cause of
                strife, and wounds, and perhaps death. Oh, promise me that you will not have any
                conflict with him!" "I do promise, Lucy, as I said, unless it be unavoidable." "It
                may be avoided, sir, if you will it-for you know the truth of the old proverb, where
                ever there is a will there is a way." "I fear the proverb is not true. I have the
                will, for in- stance, to make you mine, now and for ever. I see you trem- ble. Fear
                not-I will not importune you further, until it is fairly ascertained if there be no
                other way to remove the im- pediment. But I have a most vehement will to know the

                Now, where is he way?" You jest with me," said Lucy, smiling; " and in truth am glad
                to see your spirits reviving; for I had learned you rere in a melancholy mood." "In
                your presence, dear Lucy, my gloom and despondency anish, like vapors before the
                sun." "If you deem such fine flattering speeches the way, you re mistaken." "I did
                not-I did not. It was uttered involuntarily, and or my own gratification. It is an
                enjoyment, Lucy, for me o utter the truthful sentiments of my heart in your

                decree cannot be recalled, mntil there may be no longer any reason for its
                enforcement. Still there may be a way, if there be a will-that is, if the vill be
                true and faithful, and constant"- "Until when?" "I cannot tell. I know not. You know
                what we would earn, but will not tell. Let that suffice." "It must, perforce. We are
                interrupted." Biddy Boggle, who had admitted some one into the hall, itood at the
                door of the parlor. "Who is it, Biddy?" asked Lucy. "Dill Bizzle," said she. What
                does he want " "He says-no-I beg pardon-I meant to say Bill-Biz- ale-this time. He
                says there's a female woman-he said it mam-has a letter for you, from your aunt."
                "Show her into the other room, Biddy, and bring me the letter," said Lucy, in some
                trepidation, for she believed the messenger came from her aunt in New York. And so
                it proved; and a bright flush spread over her face, when she glanced at the
                well-known peculiarity of her aunt's cali- graphy. "I will call again, if permitted,
                this evening," said Lowe, rising. "May I do so?" is Certainly," said Lucy, half
                unconsciously, and she pro- ceeded to tear open the envelope as Lowe retired. While
                Lucy was perusing the letter, the bearer of it, Miss Edith McCrabbed, a thin, pale,
                hoop-nosed old maid, was con- ducted into the sitting-room, where she was
                recognized, by the THE FLIGHT OF LUCY. 183 widow, as the only domestic, or rather
                companion, of her sister Flora. She was greeted in a familiar and friendly manner,
                but she declined taking the seat tendered her, or removing her bonnet. "Surely you
                do not intend to return to-day?" said Mrs. Winkle. "Surely I do!" said Miss
                McCrabbed; "and the con- ductor said the train for New York would be here in fifteen
                minutes." "Why, did you not say you came for Lucy?" "Yes, mawdam, and I hope she'll
                be ready." '"To-day " Yes, mawdam.' The letter explains it all." Just then Lucyetame
                in with the letter. She hastened to bestow some friendly salutations on Miss
                McCrabbed, anJ then placing the letter in the hands of her mother, exclaimed: "I
                will be ready! I am rejoiced it is so. Do not object, mother. We will avoid the many
                unpleasant anticipations that would otherwise afflict us before parting. Read it,
                dear mothero while I prepare my trunk. Biddy, tell Bill Dizzle to stay a few
                minutes. Say I shall want him to carry Miss McCiab- bed's trunk to the depot." Lucy
                disappeared before her mother could reply. The letter ran thus :- - "M DEAR NIECE
                :-I send my Edith for you, and I de- sire that you will return with her, by the
                evening mail. She is discreet, and no one knows her in Babbleton. By accom- panying
                her, your persecutor will not be able to trace you to your asylum. Wear a thick
                veil, so that he may not recog- nize your features when you go to the cars. You nay
                safely confide in Edith. She has been my confidant for many years, as your mother
                knows. She was personally acquainted with the Great Unknown-Sir Walter-and is
                familiar with the plots and stratagems of villains. She reads for me every night,
                and has a romantic and literary disposition. Since I received your dear pathetic
                letter, I have been going over the 'Children of the Abbey' again, and find my eyes
                continually suffused with the miseries of poor Amanda. My dear child! You remind me
                of her so much, that I am painfully impatient to clasp you to my heart! Do not delay
                a moment. My , <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6922-00000098"/> 34 THE WINKLES. love to sister Edith. Tell her not to insist
                on my Edith hav- ing any refreshments, for she never takes any. "Your own aunt, "
                FLORA BLOUNT. "P. S.-Do not forget your purse, or any jewels of value. You know I am
                very poor, and we never know what vicissi- tudes may be in reserve for us. FLORA."
                Bill Dizzle glided through the hall with a trunk on his shoulder, as the first
                whistle of the approaching train was heard; and the next moment Lucy ran in and
                threw her arms around her mother's neck. "Farewell, dear mother! " cried she. " It
                is best to go thus-to part now-but we will write daily-atd if I do not return soon,
                you can come to me. I will induce my aunt to make every thing convenient for the
                visit. Never fear I I never yet strove in vain to please. I will convince her that
                she is not poor-for I believe she is rich-and are you not her only sister? Farewell,
                dear, dear mother !" A moment after, being released from her mother's embrace, Lucy
                was crossing the street with Edith McCrabbed, and when the train paused, the two
                were just at the steps, and ascended into the car without being recognized, or
                attracting the slight- est notice from the crowd that stood in the vicinity. When
                comfortably seated, and just as the cars were starting away, Lucy beheld Roland
                gazing at some ladies sitting a few feet in front of her. She turned her head
                quickly away, and trembled lest she might be discovered. But as the train moved off,
                she became satisfied she had escaped his observa- tion, and once more breathed
                freely. Mrs. Winkle laughed and wept alternately. The letter from her sister, the
                Scotch messenger, the trunk hurried away on Dizzle's shoulder, and Lucy's
                promptitude of action, were irresistible sources of amusement. But then the reality,
                the sad reality, that Lucy was gone, and that she was left alone for an indefinite
                period, with perhaps an enemy awaiting a favorable opportunity to aim a blow at the
                small remnant of her fortune; and with many malicious persons around, ever ready to
                rejoice at her calamity, produced, at every ebb of her spirits, a flood of tears. It
                was while her spirits were thus ebbing and flowing, that Lowe again entered,
                anticipating -the hour appointed for his return; for he had learned from Bill Dizzle
                that Lucy hadde parted, but in what direction Bill was unable to say, for he had
                been called away from the depot after putting down the trunk, and there were no less
                than three trains with passengers to leave in the next few minutes for as many
                different places. Is it true," cried Lowe "that Lucy has left us?" "True, indeed.
                You men would not let her rest, and so she resolved to escape." " But she appointed
                an hour for me to come hither this very evening." "Then come. Or rather stay. I hope
                she did not promise to be here herself? " "I understood her so." "You must have
                misunderstood her; she never deceives. But she has a spice of humor, and knew the
                house would be open to receive you. Laugh at it, Mr. Lowe, and confess that the men
                do not possess all the spirit vouchsafed poor humanity. I have laughed until tears
                came to my relief." "But is it prudent, Mrs. Winkle, to permit Lucy to depart
                unattended, and perhaps to remain for days or weeks, where no one interested in. her
                welfare will watch over her, and be ready to defend her from insult, if any should
                be offered ? You know she is irresiptibly lovely." "I know the gentlemen are in the
                habit of saying so. But be not uneasy. Her-safety will be guarded by others, and I
                have confidence in her own sense of duty and strength of pur- pose. Why, did she not
                fly the danger here? I assure you her departure was a suggestion of her own. I have
                no fears for Lucy." "And you will not tell me where she has gone " "No. She did not
                authorize me to do so." "Very well. I am then at liberty-to find out, if I -can.
                Permit me to take my leave, In half an hour I must be seated in the down train." As
                Lowe said this, he looked to find some indication in Mrs. Winkle's features of the
                truth of his conjecture. He had heard Dizzle say the letter was from Lucy's aunt,
                and although he was aware that Miss Wilsome had decreed the banishment of thewidow's
                family, yet he had never heard of the existence of another aunt. Therefore he
                hastened to the cars when they <pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6922-00000099"/> 186 THE WINKLES. paused at the depot, and
                set off for Philadelphia in pursuit of Lucy. Roland saw him depart from his room at
                the inn, a chamber which he often occupied expressly for the purpose of gazing at
                the ladies. When the train was in motion, he started up, and resolved to make
                another attempt to see Lucy, and even pro- pose to marry her in church, if no other
                mode remained to make her his, and thus snatch her from his hated rival. "Mrs.
                Winkle," said he, when admitted, "I am come in a fit of desperation." "Oh Lud!" said
                she, "I hope there is no danger of being killed by you!" "You misunderstand me. I am
                come once more to beg an interview with Lucy. And I am prepared to say that I will
                wed her inolen day, and in the church. My heart, my hand, my fortune are all laid at
                her feet." "Generous sir! You are too liberal! I will not inquire what boon it was
                you have hitherto been willing to bestow upon my poor child. Suffice it that your
                all is tendered at last." "You seem to mock me. Will you procure me an inter- view "
                "How can I?" "Command her to appear in your presence. She will obey." "She cannot."
                "Cannot?" "She is not here. She is gone." "Gone? Where?" "That I cannot tell."
                "Cannot tell!" exclaimed Roland furiously, and rising. "I can! She has eloped, and I
                know with whom! Madam, you could not have consented to it. If so, where was the
                necessity? I saw her seducer depart in the cars for Philadelphia. Good day, madam. I
                will pursue them I - I have agents in the city, madam, who will soon find them, and
                Lucy shall be restored. Good day, madam! I will spend ten thousand dollars rather
                than that vagabond shall have her. The vagabond is your handsome pale-faced Lowe,
                madam-a villain, madam!" Fortunately Roland did not look behind when rushing out,
                else he would have beheld the merry widow dangerously agi- tated with excessive
                laughter. The idea that Lucy's admirers A VISIT. 187 were pursuing in one direction,
                when she was flying in another and an opposite one, was irresistibly diverting.
                Roland stamped in front of the inn with his watch in his hand, resolved if the next
                down train should be a minute be- hind its time. to make those who were to blame
                suffer for it. He was a large stockholder. But this time, as if all the doomed
                victims of his ill-nature were to elude his grasp, the train arrived a minute before
                the time, and there was yet no opportunity to vent his accumulated wrath. He sprang
                in, and was soon rattled into the city. Meantime, as the shades of evening fell upon
                the peaceful village, and the mocking-bird began his song with the rising of the
                moon, unconscious that she who had never failed to ac- knowledge the tuneful
                salutation was away, an old-fashioned spring-shaft gig stopped in front of the iin,
                and an old- fashioned gentleman, in an old-fashioned coat and hat; de- scended to
                the ground. After giving the reins to the ostler, and charging him particularly to
                take good care of his ancient horse, the old gentleman turned away and proceeded
                deliber- ately to the widow's mansion. "I am very, very glad to see you, Mr. Dowly!"
                exclaimed Mrs. Winkle, when the old gentleman was ushered into her presence. "You
                could not have selected a better time to accept my invitation to tea," she
                continued, shaking his hand heartily, "for I am quite alone and require the company
                of a true friend." "My Maker knows I am your true friend. I will laugh with you, or
                weep with you, and even die---" "With me, or for me?" asked the widow. "Upon my word
                I don't know which would be the most proper. They are the words I should have spoken
                when young -but I was stupid-yet honest and true-yes, true and hon- est, Edith." "I
                am sure of it. And if you had spoken your senti- ments boldly, I do not know-- but
                all that is past, buried a quarter of a century ago. Sit opposite. Bring in the tea,
                Biddy. Let me make it. How has it happened, Mr.- Dowly, that of all the evenings in
                the world, you should have selected this, when I most desired a social companion, to
                pay me the often-deferred visit?" "I knew you were alone." "You did? How did you
                learn that?" <pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6922-00000100"/> 188 THE WINKLES. "Every body knows it. It is already the talk
                of the town and the country. I heard them speaking of it in the bar- room." "Of
                what?" "Of the poor child's elopement. But I first learned it of Dizzle, who came to
                my house." "Lucy's elopement 1t" "Yes. But be comforted. Rolahd is a bad man----"
                "Do they say she ran away with him?" "No, no. But he told every one he met, that she
                had run away with Lowe, the vagabond, as he called him; and declared he would bring
                her back, and have her lover locked up in pri- son. Then I ventured to come hither,
                hoping I might be able to afford you some little consolation; and to repeat the
                Chris- tian precepts, which alone can impart comfort in trouble. But you are not
                cast down---" "No! Ha, ha, ha What a world! Oh, how happy the Arums and Crudles, and
                Snobsons must be! How they exult, and pity the disgraced, poverty-stricken Winkles!
                And why should not I laugh too? Oh, that they could see ne! I've spilt my tea. More
                hot water, Biddy." "Do not be so much disturbed, my dear madam," said Dowly, looking
                in alarm upon the spasmodic symptoms of the widow. "Disturbed, Mr. Dowly? I beg, I
                earnestly entreat you will believe me, when I say, that whilst the envious gossips
                are exulting, or supposing they are exulting over my calamity, I enjoy some of the
                happiest moments of my life, and would fain have them witness my felicity."
                Felicity, Mrs. Winkle?" "That may be rather too strong a word; but I don't know
                another that would answer better. Mr. Dowly, Lucy has not eloped with any one!" "I
                thank my Maker! Oh, I thank my blessed Maker for it! Laugh on. I will laugh with
                you-for I do love that dear child as much as her parent can, and I hope you will
                per- mit me to say so." "And it was when you supposed me overwhelmed with
                mortification and irremediable distress-abandoned and dis- honored by my own child,
                and reviled and scoffed at by my neighbors--that you came to comfort me, to say that
                you were still my friend-that you loved my dear departed daughter; A DECLARATION.
                189 to offr consolation-to--Oh Mr. Dowly, let my tears have free vent. May God bless
                you!" "Do not weep, dear lady! If it had been really as they suppose, and as some of
                them might have had the wickedness to desire, still, believe me, John Dowly would
                have never forsaken the Edith that once and always so completely pos- sessed his
                heart." "They are not the tears of weeping, Mr. Dowly. They proceed from joy-joy,
                that there exists one pure and noble being in the world, and that being my friend.
                If it were not utterly too late in the afternoon of our lives this hand of mine
                should be yours, as the only recompense I could offer." "I am happy! To hear you say
                so, is worth more than worlds to me! My dreams are realized. .In them I have heard
                you utter similar words, and they are like the memories of blessed youth. All I ask
                is that I may not be considered bold and intrusive in my eager friendship, and in
                the tender of my services. Only permit me to think of the past, to dream on, and
                talk of the sunny days when we were young together, and I shall desire no more
                exquisite happiness in this life. Permit this, and whatever I possess is yours and
                your children's to command." "Thank you, thank you, Mr. Dowly. Any little, or great
                incident of the past that you can remember, or feeling, or word, or scene, that may
                be recalled, you may refer to without hesitation. It will be a pleasure to me.
                Although I certainly loved my husband dearly, yet John Dow!- was always near my
                heart, and its portals were never closed against him. I always loved him to the full
                extent that duty permitted; and my estimate of his character was not erroneous. I

                am sure I shall be rejoiced to learn it is not so," said Mrs. Winkle. "I have my
                poor old house, and my few barren acres. I raise no great crops, and contrive to pay

                difference. I resolved to preserve the beautiful blossom, not for any su- perior
                sweetness of its own, but for the sake of the hand which had clasped, and in memory
                of the lips that had pressed it. Thus old objects remind me of the happy past, when
                the worald to my youthful eyes was illuminated with a heavenly bright- ness. And

                object, and resolved to defeat him. He thinks me poor-and he must not be unde-
                ceived. He is a bad man, and I desire to have no strife with him. He knows I rescued
                Lucy from his grasp, but he thinks I have not been informed of his design. But Lucy!
                We have forgotten her. -Bless my life! I never was so beguiled before! It has beenmy
                intention at every pause to ask where the dear child has gone. I know why she sought
                another asylum, and would fain learn the place of her abode, if it be not improper
                to desire it." " Not at all. She is by this time with her aunt Flora." "Bless me I
                Is she living yet ? and unmarried ?" "Living and unmarried. She never could find a

                " I know she did! She would have rejected me. After you were wedded, I determined to
                seek her hand. She seemed to suspect my intention, and took the first opportunity to
                nip my hope in the bud. It was fortunate, for I could never have loved her." "She
                has never loved any one but the heroes of her nov- els; and those she Will never

                And although residing in the most public place in a great city, she lives in utter
                seclusion. Lucy could not have found a better abode." '.' I'm glad to hear it. I'm
                glad it's so." "And just to think that both Lowe and Roland are searching for her in

                Roland. I have a nice little stratagem for him. You must consent to it. He will be
                beaten at the election. Walter is to make a speech against his party, and Lucy has
                rejected his addresses with scorn. His thirst for vengeance will be uncontrollable,
                and he will endeavor to distress you by foreclosing the mort- gage." "And you will
                not permit us to be thrust into the street?" "I would be thrust into the river

                be the purchaser, no matter who -may bid against you. I will be near to sign a check
                for the amount. Then the property will be yours and unincumbered, and Roland's rage
                will consume him. The Arums and Cru- dles will be the victims of chagrin. None will
                know whence the money comes--but they might, if you used my check! I will bring the
                money, and you shall have it in your purse. They will be astonished, you relieved,
                and John Dowly the happiest man in the world." "I am not sure that Walter would
                sanction the arrange- ment. He is a little fastidious on such delicate points. But

                can de- posit it in my keeping." "I see no objections---- " "No--do not conjure up

                letter from Sergeant Blore for Walter. The widow took pos- session of it, and Bill
                retired immediately. The letter not being sealed, Mra Winkle assumed the liberty of
                reading it. It ran as follows: "Dear Sir: Excuse my bad writing, for you know I
                write with my left hand, and hold the paper down with my right stump. I saw Col.
                Oakdale to-day, and he said you would be home to-night, therefore I write. "I want
                to see you as soon as convenient. The enemy has begun operations, and violated the
                capitulations. My garrison holds out yet, but we are in distress, and if not soon
                relieved, we must surrender, expecting no quarter. The "Pardon my interruption,"
                said Mr. Dowly, but do you know what is meant by the enemy?" "Oh, yes," said the
                widow; "my brother's wife, the new Mrs Winkle. [Reading] The enemy has almost made
                your uncle a prisoner in his own house. His cheeks are paler, and his eyes
                bloodshotten. The intention is to make him abdi- cate. I know it is. At the same
                time, the she-wolf pretends to be so affectionate, that he cannot speak a harsh word
                to her. But she fills all his time, and talks so mch, that he can say nothing. There
                is foul play in the wind, I know. She has convinced him there is danger in war, and
                that he is liable to be killed by the Bull. She wants him to make his will-which I
                call an abdication; and if he abdicates in' her favor, she'll not care a grape-shot
                how soon he does die. In- deed, she might help him off--like the infernal tigress
                Catha- rine of Russia did her husband. So you see the danger is very great. But I am
                not idle. Every time the red-haired Scotch lawyer Bawson comes out of her closet, I
                lead him into mine; and as he is a Scotchman, and as I offer two dol- lars where she
                offers one, I may gain the victory, as Richelieu used to do. He has agreed, if
                ordered by your uncle to draw up a will, to insert your name. The she devil, like
                all women who are tyrants, don't know a will from a deed, and is a per- feet fool in
                business transactions. But I pity the commander. "Have you seen a lawyer for me

                the advantage of her. She's been married twice, and I only once. But I doubt it. She
                was married to men, and I to a woman. It makes all the dif- ference in the world. No
                matter. If she declares war, I must defend myself to the last extremity-and I won't
                pay any indemnity. Reconnoitre the old catamount for me before you leave town. Come
                to the garrison through the orchard. The Bull keeps all the cattle yet. Your
                faithful old soldier, TH. BLORE." This despatch afforded the old couple an ample
                topic for the remainder of the evening; and when they rose from the tea-table, it
                was striking eleven o'clock. The old gentleman, after declaring the hours just spent
                were among the happiest of his life, and receiving an assurance from the widow that
                her lonely condition had been assuaged by his presence, departed for the inn, and
                calling for his old horse, drove slowly home- ward by moonlight in a delightful
                revery. CHAPTER XVII. WILSOME WINKLE DISMSSES THE POET-ROLAND MEETS LOWE AND THE
                ACTOR, BUT NOT LUCY. WALTER'S visit to his aunt was capricibusly prolonged, under
                the belief that his presence was the means of procuring her a larger share of the
                poet's company. and additional rubbers at whist. But the moment the attraction of
                her nephew seemed to cease in its effect on Pollen, she dismissed him. It oc- curred
                on the very day that Lucy departed from Babbleton, and the young man and Virginia
                were espied passing through the village in an open carriage, having landed from the
                boat just when Roland had taken his seat in the cars. He cast a fierce glance at the
                happy pair, and secretly resolved to balk their purposes; for it seemed to be his
                uling passion to mar the happiness of others, as if by that means he could realize a
                greater share himself. Walter, not observing him, urged forward the horses, and
                never paused until he reached the hospitable mansion of the colonel, where he

                the next morning. , At the Winkle mansion in the city, a succession of novel events
                followed the departure of Walter. When her nephew rose from the dinner table, Pollen
                was requested by Miss Wilsome to remain, and was invited to drink wine with her. For
                some time the poet had abstained from the use of such stimulants, under the
                persuasion that they were uniformly pernicious to one of his excitable tem-
                perament; and Wilsome had once applauded his resolution for she was not ignorant of
                his infirmity. But now the time had arrived for him to propose; and as he had
                evinced no dis- position to bring matters to a crisis, she determined to stimu- late
                him a little. But in vain, He only spouted Greek, and lamented over his lost one in
                heaven. He abused the critics, and denounced the publishers. The Jews were likewise
                the objects of his anathemas. Then he lived in the future, and anticipated the time
                when all who had neglected him, or wronged him, would be the victims of remorse. The
                popular authors of the day, who monopolized the favors of the public press, would
                sink in oblivion, and the works of men of genius rise to set no more. He was deaf to
                the .suggestions of his entertainer, and finally arose from the table, and with
                folded arms and muttering lips, strode through the hall and out into the street. The
                old lady did not faint, or turn pale, or become vio- lently agitated. Her heart was
                proof against all such effects of disappointment.,. 'If she had ever loved truly and
                dearly, it must have been at so remote a period, she had forgotten it herself; and
                her heart was now quite impervious to ender _ emotions, when meditating the details
                of a matrimo ar- rangement. But all her feelings were not callous. T cannot' wholly
                conquer the impulses of resentment in breasts of old women. There are some paasions
                as indestr ble as the immortal mind-the evil as well as the good. Miss Wilsome was
                not naturally malignant; and she possessed a certain hereditary magnanimity which
                mingled with, and sometimes overcame her resentments. .'- "Rose," said she, when the

                address, so that I can send him a note. The fellow may not have money enough to buy
                a dinner; but he dines here no more. I will not be scandalized for nothing." ," Iss,
                mem."' "Hold your tongue, and go about your business Go to the door. Some one is
                ringing now. If it be Pollen, do as I ordered you." "Iss, mer." Well, who is it? A

                Mr. Lowe and at this hour I Admit him-perhaps he has not dined. Bring him here. He
                shall take the poet's wine, and perhaps-" She was interrupted by the entrance of
                Lowe, whom she greeted with much cordiality, and then compelled him to oc. cupy a
                seat at the table. "Now, what's the news? Mind, you are to say nothing in relation
                to the disgraceful affairs of my brother." "But I must be permitted to refer to your
                niece. I sup- pose she is here?" "Here? Not she " "Not here?" No, sir. I have said
                it, and it used to be a saying, that a Winkle always spoke the truth. But the poor
                poet, Pollen -ha, ha, ha t-asserted that a good reason might be alleged for the
                utterance of a certain quantity of falsehoods, and what do you suppose it is " ":am
                sure I cannot conjecture." Why, it is that truth is too precious a commodity to be l

                prepared to pay his debts." "Excellent. I shall prefer you to the poet. Be my guest,
                and we will have a whist party." "Excuse me-until I can hear something of Lucy."
                "Lucy I Is she really not at home? "She left home suddenly to-day, and would not
                permit it to be known whither she was going." "Not even her mother?" THE TRUTH. 197
                I believe her mother does know; but she refuses to tell me." "Why should she tell
                you? Are you in love with her?" "I confess I am!" "Then, I presume she reciprocates
                the affection." : And runs away?" "Certainly. The women are enigmas, and understand
                each other. If the men knew us as well as we do ourselves, there would be no hope
                for us. But, fortunately, we can keep our own secrets. She had a sufficient reason
                for going, de- pend upon it. You have your mystery, and. she has hers. She is
                safe-with some schoolmate, perhaps. No Winkle ever committed an impropriety, and
                none ever will. I except my brother; but he is a man, and men, you know, can commit
                them with impunity." "I am glad you feel no uneasiness on account of the ab- sence
                of your niece."' "Uneasiness! Why should I, while her mother is calm? But take my
                advice, and cease to pursue that silly girl. She is pretty, I admit; virtuous, I
                know; accomplished, as all may see; but she will be an expensive wife, and her lord
                should have an ample treasury, which I presume you have not. Besides, I had intended
                her for another," continued Wilsome, fondling the great white cat, which she had
                taught to occupy a seat at the table. "Another?" C"Yes-a rich man. I mean Roland."
                "Madam," said Lowe, sternly, "Roland is a villain " "Is this jealousy?" "No, Miss
                Wilsome, it is the truth. I will, confidentially, relate to you the circumstance
                which proves it." He did so. "If I thought, sir, you possessed the wicked nature ,of
                your master," said Wilsome, pulling the cat's ear a I would have you drowned this
                night! Oh, the monster! To make : such an attempt upon a Winkle! Walter shall cut
                his ears off!" No; Lucy forbade any one molesting him. I met him, and branded him
                with the name of coward. -Lucy learned this shortly afterwards, and exacted a
                promise that I would have no deadly conflict with him. - And she does not wish her
                brother to know any thing of the occurrence." "It is an affair, then, in which I
                shall not meddle. But <pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6922-00000105"/> 198 THE WINKLES. I shall revoke my invitation to Roland
                to visit the mansion. You shall be welcome, always; but still, I would have you
                abandon the pursuit of my niece. She is in safety-you may rely upon it; and if she
                has resolved not to be found, you will not succeed in your endeavors. Remain with
                me." "I will do so cheerfully, for the present, and have taken lodgings for several
                days at my hotel. I have a little mis- chief in contemplation against some of the
                rich enemies of Lucy in Babbleton, which, with your assistance, may be con- summated
                without difficulty. We shall have to employ the milliners and mantuamakers."
                "Willingly. I can command them all There's the bell! Who is it, Rose?" "Mr. Roland,
                mem." "Roland!" "I pray you see him," said Lowe. "Take him into the front parlor."
                "Iss, mem." "Mr. Lowe, do you go into the rear one; but remain out of sight." It was
                done as she desired. "Miss Wilsome," said Roland, not seeming to observe the old
                maid's stiff, frigid nod, "I come in great concern, to ask if your niece is at your
                house." "She is not; and I do not know where she is." "Then she is lost-ruined!"
                "How is she ruined?" "Her character is gone for ever!" "That is impossible, sir;
                therefore, it is false!" "You are mistaken. She has eloped " "Eloped! Do you know
                who you are speaking about? Who you are speaking to? "You may rely upon what I say.
                You think it impossi- ble for one of her character to take such a desperate step.
                But it is true. She has eloped with an idle, good-for-nothing vagabond--what's
                that?" "Achee I Achee!" sneezed Lowe. "A friend of mine, who is as deaf as a post.
                He cannot hear you. But if he could, I should not fear any damage to Lucy's

                heard that sneeze at Babbleton." "Never mind the sneeze. I say calumnies. Lucy is
                in- capable of doing any thing to compromise her character, and I will not believe a
                word of it. But why are you so deeply interested?" "Me? You know I love her!" "Ay,
                as the wolf does the lamb!" Lowe had also in- formed her of Roland's beguilement of
                the player's daughter. He had it from Walter. t I would marry her." "You would?"
                said Wilsome, half abstracted by an amusing thought which flashed upon her mind.
                "Perhaps the girl may be in the city, and may be .found. My coach- man can
                ascertain. Sit down, and look over the paper. Ex- cuse me for a few minutes. But if
                I produce her within the next half hour, you will pledge yourself to wed her?"
                "Yes-that is-certainly, if-if she is--" "If she will have you-say that," and Wilsome
                hastened away, through the hall, leaving Lowe, who had been suffering from the
                effects of a recent cold, and was remarked to sneeze very peculiarly, still
                occupying his position in the rear parlor, the folding-doors being nearly closed. At
                the expiration of a brief space of time the mischievous old maid reappeared, and
                soon after a loud ring was heard at the street door. "Is it Lucy?" asked Roland, his
                features relaxing. "You shall see." "Mr. Glass!" cried Snapper, throwing open the
                door, and ushering in the actor. "Mr. Roland," said the actor, "where is my
                daughter? Tell me where my poor child is, and I will forgive the rest." "I have not
                the custody of your daughter. Go, sir; you are mistaken. I pity your distresses, and
                am willing to re- lieve them. Here is a bank note. You are in error. Your daughter
                is not in my possession." "Poor Delia!" said Glass, taking the money, however; I
                fear she is lost for ever. You know Mr. Roland-- "I do not; I tell you no! Leave me,
                now, and I will call and see if we cannot find her." "I thought you were seeking for
                Lucy," observed Wil- some. "Is she another one whom he has enticed away from the

                permission, sir; and I hope my friend in the next room will not be annoyed." "He!"
                exclaimed Roland, upon beholding' Lowe, who arose and came forward with a deliberate
                step. "Is this your deaf friend?" asked Roland, casting a re- proachful look at
                Wilsome. "My hearing is not very acute," said Lowe, "since my exposure in the night
                air, at the country residence of Mr. Napoleon Winkle." "I trust you will soon
                recover," said Roland, deeming there was no danger of a personal assault on such an
                occasion. "My nerves are not at all affected," replied Lowe, with a steady gaze,
                "But who is the idle fellow you alluded to?" asked Glass. "Yes, let us know who you
                mean," added Wilsome. "There are many such persons as the one I alluded to," said
                Roland, evasively. "But, Miss Wilsome, it does appear that you were not ignorant of
                the elopement of your niece. I presume she is here, and that she is protected by
                you. It is enough!" "It is enough, sir, that you should be content," remarked Lowe,
                in distinct tones. "Miss Lucy has not eloped with any one. It is an unfounded
                imputation. And if such a re- port has been put in circulation, it is a base
                calumny; and I would willingly undertake to maintain what I say in the pres- ence of
                its slanderous author." "I have no particular concern in the matter. H--" "Stop, Mr.
                Roland," said Wilsome; "did you not say you would marry Lucy?" "No matter what I
                said! I see a plot has been concert- ed here for your amusement, and I trust it will
                be enjoyed while it may. .Come, Glass, I'll go home with you." "No, sir!" replied
                the indignant actor. "You have already made my hearth desolate." "Fool If that is
                your gratitude, give me back the money." "You owe me a thousand times more than your
                purse can AN ACTOR'S PURSE. 201 pay. You have stolen my daughter, and my good name.
                My purse is mere trash-- Very true, Glass, very true. Very good I Good day, Glass."
                And Roland rushed away. "He's gone," said Glass, unfolding the bank note and reading
                the denomination. "He made a mistake, I am sure. He had two notes, and gave me the
                wrong one. I don't know whether I ought to keep this?" "Why not?" asked Wilsome.
                "This is more than he intended to give. This is a-hun- dred dollar note-the other
                was a ten. He intended to give me the other." "No matter," said Lowe, "he can afford
                it. And no doubt you will find use for it." "True, sir; we are all poor-I mean the
                actors." "I have often heard that said," remarked Wilsome, "but could never
                understand why it should be so." "It is quite easy to account for it," said Glass.
                "Our salaries are small, and our expenditures are large. And such as myself, who am
                an American, the poorest of all." "And does it follow because you are an American?"
                asked Lowe, with interest. "It does. The managers and treasurers are Englishmen, and
                favor their own countrymen." "But the audiences are Americans." "True. But what of
                that? They don't know the Eng- lish actors from the native born; and they don't
                often see the managers on the boards. They are generally the most uncon- scionable
                tyrants in the world; and if the people only knew them, they would not patronize
                them. But just now we are on half salaries, The great singers at the other house
                have carried the city, and our establishment has ceased to be the fashionable
                resort. The gratification about the matter is, that the British who oppress the
                Americans are themselves sometimes overcharged by the Germans, the Italians, and
                -French artists. Just now the good people would rather pay five dollars to hear a
                German sing, than to witness a British play. American plays cannot be brought on the
                stage. My friend Pollen has been attempting it for two years." "That is very
                extraordinary," said Lowe. "But it is true," said the actor. "The only hope for an

                British society, and introduce lords and ladies in his play." "You are very severe
                on my country- " "What! are you an Englishman, Mr. Lowe?" asked Miss Wilsome. "I
                must confess it was my fortune to be born in merry Old England. Nevertheless, I must
                acknowledge there is much justice in my friend's remarks. But the way to be
                redressed, Mr. Glass, is to carry the war into Africa. I have seen you on the stage,
                and like your simple, natural style of acting; and I have also seen your daughter,
                whom I believe to be ca- pable of eminent success. Take her to London--" "To London,
                sir?" "Yes, to London. Be kind enough to furnish me with your address, and I will
                inclose you a letter for a friend of mine in England, who will be found able, and I
                doubt not entirely willing, to put you in the way of making a fortune." "Sir, you
                speak like one in earnest, and one who may have the ability of performing what he
                promises. Here is my card, sir; and I shall be happy to see you at my humble abode."
                "I will take an occasion to call, sir," said Lowe. Glass then departed, with a
                lighter spirit, and a heavier purse, than when he entered. CHAPTER XVIII. THE ARUMS
                AND CRUDLE8 GO TO CHURCH IN THEIR FINE DRESSES, AND ARE ECLIPSED BY PATTY O'PAN. IT
                was Sunday, a bright, beautiful, inspiring day; and every body in the village not
                belonging to the other denominations, seemed determined to attend the services in
                the ancient church, of which Mr. Amble was the rector, and in which the Winkles had
                worshipped their Maker for many generations. Lowe had visited the widow for the
                purpose of accompanying her to church, and to confound the gossips who were
                industriously circulating the report of his elopement with Lucy. Amused, rather than
                annoyed at the creduity and uncharitableness of DISPLAY OF DRESSES AT CHURCH. 203
                the people, he had secluded himself since his return from the city, and had seized
                an opportunity when no idle gazers were in the street, to cross over to the widow's
                cottage. Walter was in high spirits. His mother had made known to him his sister's
                desire to have the place of her temporary abode kept a profound secret, and he had
                promised not tov divulge it. But he was ignorant of the cause of her flight, and
                could only conjecture that it grew out of a desire to defer coming to a decision on
                the various matrimonial proposals which he doubted not had been made her. Lowe had
                even ven- tured to inform him, that the mysterious disappearance of his sister had
                given rise to a rumor of an elopement at which Walter laughed very heartily, and
                begged his friend not to contradict it. If one could have seen the hearts, and read
                the inclina- tions of the members of Mr. Amble's congregation that morn- ing, it is
                quite possible he would have found a large proportion of them entertaining a desire
                to witness the humiliation of the occupants of the conspicuous pew of the Winkles.
                Some were merely curious; but more were exultant. They determined to go to church at
                an earlier time than usual that morning, to see the remnant of the proud Winkle
                family enter after themselves, and proceed in dejected proces- sion to the old pew.
                Besides, nearly every member of the ,congregation had to pass Mrs. Winkle's door on
                the way to church; and their triumphant smiles, and felicitous glances might be seen
                and comprehended by any of the family hap. pening to be looking out of the windows.
                The Arums and Crudles in particular, who had been disappointed the preced- ing
                Sunday in the exhibition of their fine dresses and new bonnets, to a large audience,
                in consequence of a threatening cloud-which, however, had not deterred- them from
                walking to church, although it had driven the curious gazers from the street-were
                now resolved to make a crushing parade of their earthly habiliments. Their faces
                were wreathed in smiles, as if an unwonted happiness had been reserved for them that
                morning. They were now the undisputed belles of the vil- lage, and the Winkles could
                never again "look down" on them, unless it were from their hiding-places. It is not,
                perhaps, a singular idiosiyncrasy of our nature to become more condescending and
                complaisant to those be- neath us in-the social scale, after we have levelled in the
                dust 9O <pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6922-00000108"/> who have long towered above us. Ilwas so with the ams and
                Crudles. All little rivalries and jealousies that I existed between them were
                immediately reconciled upon announcement of the elopement, and uniting their forces,
                y visited in turn every acquaintance they had in the village, the purpose of
                spreading the joyful tidings. Many of ir own sex, who had aspired to be their rivals
                in beauty and omplishments, in the absence of wealthy and who had often urred their
                enmity, were now familiarly accosted, and the rs proclaimed to them. Even the
                shopkeepers' daughters, I some few of the mechanics' wives, were informed by the
                Sndly belles of the horrible occurrence. And when they sed the round of visits-and
                such incessant visiting had rer been known before in Babbleton-they stood on their
                rble steps, or promenaded in front of their houses, and im- ted the glad tidings to
                any familiar pedestrians. At the ringing of the first bell a hundred doors flew open
                lultaneously, and the street leading past the widow's door the church, was filled
                with men and women-mostly women. e Arums led the procession, followed by the
                Crudles. ey flaunted the magnificent apparel, and the fantastic hions, which had
                been ostentatiously but vainly displayed the Sunday before, but which had not
                escaped the particu- attention of Lowe, as will be seen immediately. And Lowe, and
                Walter, and even the merry widow, were r delighted spectators. They-were peeping
                through the netian blinds, themselves unseen. On swept the leaders of fashion-and
                Patty O'Pan flirted ; into the street, and, accompanied by Bill Dizzle, swept er
                them. Her advent was announced by a universal out- rst of laughter. The children, in
                particular, could not be trained. Her dress was precisey similar to the costly Ds of
                the Arums, and her bonnet and ribbons, and feathers I flowers, exactly the kind worn
                by the Crudles. Bill Iked the curb, deeming it next to profanation to approach h;in
                six feet of such a gorgeous creation. He was dressed his Sunday best," and strove
                with all his. might to mani- t, by his carriage and gestures, his great admiration
                of ,tty. The Arums and Crudles gazed behind in amazement, and epressible anger,
                which was the signal for a louder outhurst merriment than ever. And then,
                discomfited, and agitated --- ". V ...Vlol LIo THjaM ALL. 205 with shame and
                bortification, they hastened to escape the odious comparison by vanishing out of
                public view. But even the church did not screen them, for Patty and Dizzle had ob-
                tained permission to occupy Mr. Dowly's pew, in full view of the congregation, and
                just across the aisle from the Arums. There was a buzz among the women; some angry
                looks; and many merry faces. Lowe and Miss Wilsome had done their work well; and the
                habiliments of the rich parvenus were so striking, -and the imitation of Patty O'Pan
                so perfect and conspicuous, that the comparison was inevitable. Nor, indeed, did
                Patty have just cause to shrink from the scrutiny: for nature had bestowed on her a
                finer form than any of her con- temptuous rivals could boast. But that did not
                prevent ma. lignant whispers from circulating. She was every thing that was vile,
                and her amaster a monster of evil. Of course, no girl could earn in an honest way
                enough money to indulge such extravagancies; and the brazen impudence of such an
                exposure, and in a Christian church, was too abominable to be borne. Such were the
                thoughts of the indignant Mrs. Arum, and she wrote them down with her pencil on a
                card, and sent it to Mr. Amble by the sexton. "Good heavens!" exclaimed the
                minister, upon reading the note. "What is to be done? The church will lose the
                contributions of the Arums and Cradles, if she is not re- moved! What shall I do?
                Go, sexton, and tell this Patty O Pan the pew she is in belongs to Mr. I)owly, who
                may ar- rive at any moment." The sexton, after a short absence, reappeared before
                the anxious minister in the vestry room. "She says she knows whose pew it is, sir;
                and that she applied for permission to occupy it, and obtained it. And he told me to
                mind my business, and not meddle with her affairs, sir." "What shall be done?"
                continued Amble, wringing his ands. "Old John Dowly, poor as he is, gives as much to
                he church as any other man! Do try and get that Dizzle boy )Ut." . ' "He shook his
                fist at me, sir!" "Ie did? I'll pound them in my sermon! The pew hall be made a hot

                206 THE WINKLES. the service in my church! And that the *tinkles, who built the
                church originally, have disgraced themselves! Another sensation was produced by the
                arrival of Mrs. Griselda Winkle's equipage. She descended in great state, alone
                being unattended by her lord, who was never a regular attendant at church, though a
                regular contributor to its trea- sury. She floated in, richly dressed, and sparkling
                with jewels. After bowing to the Arums and Crudles, and returning the smiles of
                others, she was startled upon taking possession of her pew, at the appearance of
                Patty O'Pan and Bill Dizzle, in her immediate vicinity. Bill could stand it no
                longer, and in obedience to a look from the imperious bride, whose meaning did not
                admit of misconstruction, the frog-catcher slunk quiet- ly out of the church,
                without even attracting the notice of Patty, so accomplished was he in the art of
                creeping about unobserved. A few moments sufficed for one of the Arums to glide into
                Griselda's pew, and impart to her the news. The aston- ished bride glanced at the
                vacant Winkle pew, and then ele- vated her eyes in a sort of half exultant and half
                commiserat- ing astonishment. She then frowned very fiercely at Patty, to whose
                splendid dress Miss Arum had next directed her attention. But Patty was better
                nerved than Dizzle, and thrust out her nether lip, in open defiance of the proud
                milliner. She even pointed significantly at her bonnet, meaning, perhaps, that
                Griselda herself was nothing better than a milliner. Matters remained thus until
                every pew was occupied but the one where Lucy used to sit. No one ventured to go
                into it I But, just in time to avoid being too late to hear the first verses read,
                the widow Winkle appeared at the door with her usual merry smile. And she was
                attended by Lowe and Wal- ter. They stepped forward deliberately, and occupied the
                vacant pew towards which so many glances had been cast. There was a silence, a
                sudden hush in the congregation, which the appearance of the minister had- never
                produced. And this no one knew better than Mr. Amble himself, who stood silent, or
                stupefied, gazing at the widow's party, and particularly at Lowe, as if doubtful of
                his identity. And many others did the same, wondering if, after what they hada
                heard, it could pos- sibly be Mr. Lowe himself. It seemhed so. The Arums and Crudles
                could not deny it-and they ceased to cast their exultant glances about, and checked
                their significant smiles. CalS ^ ^ A DULL SERMON. 207 Indeed, from the apparent
                elongation of their chins, one might have supposed their pleasantries had been
                abruptly annihilated by some unlooked-for vexation. The sermon was a dull one, for
                Mr. Amble was obliged to deviate from the subject he had selected with a view of in-
                directly referring to the recent occurrence, which had been the topic of his
                parishioners. He saw that there was some mistake in the matter; and there could
                hardly be any foundation for the report which implicated Mr. Lowe, since he had
                accom- panied Lucy's mother to church. Nor did Mrs. Winkle's and Walter's placid
                countenances indicate that Lucy had taken any step calculated to plunge them in
                misery. After the sermon, Griselda hastened out of the church and ordered the
                coachman to drive her home without delay. She was too wise to be identified with any
                of the parties until she could know precisely the true state of affairs. The Arums
                and Crudles were again subjected to the mor- tification of having to share the
                admiration of the public with Patty O'Pan. And that the cause of their annoyance
                might not be absent from their sight, Patty chose, this time, to keep immediately in
                front of them, still attended by Dizzle at an awfully respectful distance from her
                elbow. The Arums and Crudles did not attend the afternoon services, but remained at
                home venting their censures on the sexton, Lowe, Dowly, and even on Mr. Amble
                himself, as if it had been his duty to keep such cattle as Patty O'Pan in their
                proper places. But in the afternoon Col. Oakdale's carriage drove up to the
                church-yard gate, and Walter had the satisfaction of seeing Virginia descend from
                it. He had stepped forward to assist her in alighting, but was anticipated by
                Roland, who had ac- companied her and her father from the country. Walter shook
                hands as usual with Roland, being still profoundly ignorant of his wicked
                machinations. The colonel, after his daughter and Roland had entered the door,
                plucked Walter aside, and encouraged him to persevere in his design of aiming a
                fatal blow at the fanatical reformers, at the great meeting to be held at the
                court-house in Babble- ton on the following night. The colonel owed Roland some
                $10,000, and although they were opposed to each other in politics, of course
                friendly personal relations had always sub- ' sisted between them. And if the
                colonel himself did noV"' <pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6922-00000110"/> 208 THE WINKLES. choose to come- in
                conflict with his creditor on the stump, he had no hesitation in stimulating others
                to do so. Besides, it was supposed he aspired to a seat in the U S. Senate, and the
                choice was to be made at the next session of the legislature. Walter promised to do
                his utmost; and the fact that Roland had monopolized the attention of Virginia, was
                not calculated to produce an abandonment of his purpose. CHAPTER XIX. PREACHNG OF
                THE POET-SNOBSON'S RAPTURE WITH HS SWEETHEART. IT was on Monday, in the afternoon,
                and at night Walter was to make his maiden speech before a thousand auditors. He sat
                beside his mother near the parlor window, gazing thought- fully into the street. "I
                am glad, Walter," said his parent, referring to the subject upon which they had been

                exertion to supply the deficiencies of fortune. My uncle, and even Aunt Wilsome,
                might be applied to successfully; but it would be repugnant to my feel- ings to
                demand assistance from either of them. Gusset will endeavor to secure my uncle's

                and his estate encumbered; and besides, his creditor, Roland, the wealthy. oland, is

                not,' you know, is the recommendation of your favorite poet. But do not 'set down
                aught in malice."' "I am no man's enemy. See! yonder comes my friend Pollen Mother,
                you know him. We will entertain him. He comes this way. His hat is old--it was new
                but yester- day--and his coat is soiled and buttoned up to the neck, as when I first
                met him. He is in distress, mother; and he might have been rich, but for his
                disinterested sense of pro- priety. Pollen! how do you do, old fellow?" "Not very
                well, in purse and stomach, if you would have the truth; and nothing else can be
                extorted from me. May I come in?" .9 "The door is open; if not, break it down, or
                come through the window." The poet had most cordial salutations from both the mother
                and the son. His hunger was satisfied, and he was furnished with the same shirt of
                Walter's he had worn on a former occasion, and which its owner had declared should
                never be used by any one else. "Oh that 1 were an apostle, or other accredited

                the boat. "Why, Pollen " demanded Walter. "I would go into the street, and erect
                another altar to the unknown God, and worship there. This generation of fools have
                forgotten their Maker, and bow only to the golden calf. Some think themselves honest
                and religious-and so did the silly worshippers of the false god. But they had Moses
                and Aaron to denounce their idol; whilst many of our monitors never fail to share
                the treasure, and beg for more! The great Creator made the gold; and if they worship
                the metal, instead of its author, it follows that the true God must be unknown.
                Therefore, I would erect another altar to the unknown God." "Go on, Pollen," said
                Walter; " let your ideas flow freely under the inspiration of the hour. I may avail
                myself of some of them to-night." "Money, money! We see the image of human faces on
                the coins and on the bank-bills. Wherefore? But I can see money in men's faces!
                Poetry is seen in the frensied eye; heroism in the calm lip and lofty brow; love in
                the languish ing gaze; hatred in the frown, and pleasure in the smile; and as
                plainly as these are perceptible, I can distinguish the base image of the dollar in
                the faces of nearly all. I see approach- ing now a millionnaire. His face is very
                familiar. See his harsh gesticulation, and his rapidly moving lips. Would you not
                know his thoughts? -I can read them." "Read them," said Walter. "He supposes himself
                to have been the most miserable man among the passengers on the boat. He is a
                usurer, and a speculator. Yesterday, if he had made a certain invest- ment, when the
                opportunity offered, his income would have been greater than that of any man in the
                city. Now, the in- comes of two or three surpass his, and he is truly miserable.
                But, fortunately, he has not the pride nor the happiness of the poor merchant
                following him. The merchant, although wielding thousands of money not belonging to
                him, is believed here to be wealthy. To undeceive them, would be destruc- tion. In
                the city he expended $6,000 per annum-here, only $2,000, and still maintains a
                better style than most of his neighbors. Hence his happiness. Next comes a broker's

                and is more respected than his landlord. The next in order, the shopkeepers and the
                mechanics-are more genteel in costume than the millionnaire. Their superi- ority
                consists in the fact that they chance to have semi-rural residences; while others of
                their class, less fortunate than themselves, are compelled to drag out a monotonous
                life in the city-ever languishing at their counters and benches. But money, more or
                less, is distinguishable in the faces of all. Where there is none, all is blank, or
                dark and gloomy. No-I see a few exceptions." "The Quakers?" asked Walter. "No, sir,
                no! I see, too, the approaching group of meek and pious Friends. I have seen them
                often. Money has made its deepest indentures on the faces of most of them. On the
                boat, or in the cars, their thoughts and words refer exclusively to the golden god.
                Buying and selling-the prices of commodities-the profits or losses on certain opera-
                tions-the eagerness to acquire, the fear to lose; such are their topics! Religious,
                yet regardless of the decalogue; meek and inoffensive, yet practising usury;
                philanthropists, yet contemning all laws, human and divine, which do not ac- cord
                with the secret promptings in their own breasts." "You say nothing of the ladies,"
                remarked Walter. "It were best. to say nothing. Pictures--mere pictures. The good
                are in Heaven! I know one who is there! No matter. Yonder doll will toss her head,
                and tell you her father is a banker. She need say no more. WTorshippers will cast
                themselves at her feet,-I mean such as have a less share of the golden calf than
                herself. But yonder comes one who has more, and he ceases to worship her and turns
                away." Snobson!" exclaimed Walter, seeing the young man ap- proaching alone. -"But
                your exceptions, Pollen, who are they? "The contented farmer, or student, or the
                gardener, who delights in the perfect productions of nature---- "Such is Dibble!"
                "No matter. He is deservedly happy. The teacher, who is contented with a moderate
                salary; the calm philosopher; the innocent theorist; the man of imagination, who
                builds castles in the air, and inhabits them himself, provided he has a substantial
                larder; all who exercise the nobler impulses of the heart, enfranchised from the

                only be the case in rural districts, here the air is uncontaminated. In the city,
                incessant loney-making must ever prevent the people from meditating a loftier
                subjects. Thus, you see the difference between Dwn and country. Snobson is coming
                here." "Yes; come in, Snobson!" cried Walter. "Don't hesi- ite. Pollen and I are
                alone." "I'm glad of it," said Snobson, joining them. "I want tell you how I've been
                made a fool of." "Oh, you need not tell us that!" said Walter. "Have you heard it
                already No-it would be inipossi. le. But before I begin-it's all a lie, ain't it,
                about your ister eloping with Mr. Lowe? I know it is, for I just now aw Mr. Lowe
                enter his own door. The Arums and Crudles, suspect, raised the report.' "Why,
                Snobson! how does it happen that you are so sav- ge on the Arums and Crudles?" -
                I'll tell you all about it. I was completely taken in, nd fascinated, before I had
                time to think." "The artful nymphs!" said Pollen. "You may say so-but they were
                outwitted at last, as you hall hear. I was bewildered with their playing, their
                sing- ng, and their dressing. Don't they dress! And when they irted their pretty
                little feet, I could not help, accidentally ou know, seeing the magnificent borders
                of their petticoats! ?arke was cooler than me. He don't mind such things. But was
                carried by storm, as Sergeant Blore says. I was in a Quandary. I didn't know which
                to have. They settled it, lowever. After a little hair-pulling in the next room, the
                Victorious one, the youngest, came to me, and waited until I proposed. I was snapped
                up, and the matter was laid before our parents, who were perfectly willing, provided
                the condi- ions and terms could be made to suit them. What do you hink our fathers
                proposed?" "Dollars," said Pollen. ' You are not far wrong. My father authorized me
                to say o Mr. Arum that my allowance of five hundred dollars per Lnnm would be
                continued, and that my wife would be intro- luced into the society his family
                frequented--which is better ban that she has been accustomed to." "And what did her
                father propose?" asked Walter. POLLEN'S SPEECH ENDED. 213 "Why, to defray one half
                the expense of furnishing a house for us!" "And you were to live on love?" asked
                Walter. "No-dollars!" said Pollen. "Yes; and they were to come all from one side. He
                re. quired my father to make me a partner in the banking-house, with a capital of
                fifty thousand dollars, and to introduce my wife and all his family to our friends!
                The expense of living was to be defrayed by my share of the profits, and he was to
                have one expensive daughter off his hands! That's what my father says. So, seeing I
                would have nothing more than my five hundred dollars-except the wife and the house-I
                backed out. It is too small a sum for two, and you know I have my boarding and
                lodging for nothing while single. I'll stay single, till one or the other of the old
                governors drops off." "But what did the lady say?" asked Walter. She was as willing
                as myself to be off because she had expected a large fortune all at once." Tea was
                now announced. CHAPTER XX. A REFORM MEETING, AND WALTER'S SPEECH-BLORE'S ESCAPE FROM
                HS WIFE. THE court-house was illuminated with gas and filled with peo. )le. The poor
                had been brought thither by the friends of Roland, and the rich had come for the
                purpose of hearing the ion of their late friend, Mr. Winkle, who had been their re-
                3pected. representative in Congress. Roland, at the conclusion of his speech,
                remarked that he iad understood le was to be followed and replied to by his routhful
                friend, who volunteered to address the people in be- lalf of Mr. Plastic, his
                opponent. He requested that he night have a patient hearing, if for no other reason,
                as a mark ,f respect for the memory of his father, who had served his ountry well.
                But, at the same time, it should be remembered - <pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6922-00000113"/> 214 THE . WINKLES. that his
                lamented father had never been known to interpose any obstacles to the wholesome
                reforms demanded by his con. stituents; and there could be no doubt, if he were
                still alive, and present on that occasion, he would be found on the side of the
                people, and in opposition to his own son. Walter rose up with a composed
                countenance, and thanked his more experienced friend for his handsome introduction
                of the son of his father; and the first sentence, uttered with a peculiar sort of
                gravity, produced a burst of laughter, which was not at all relished by Roland.
                "Fellow-citizens," continued Walter, "I have listened, as you did, in silence and
                astonishment to the intimation of the speaker, that the son of my father was
                inimical to wholesome reforms. I deny it!" Great applause followed his denial. "On
                the opium question, I am prepared to denounce all who indulge in the excessive use
                of the drug. And as our courts have decided that the legislature have the power to
                prohibit its use as a mere stimulant, without the prescription of a phy- sician, I
                have not one word to utter in opposition to such a law, although I cannot see
                precisely how my friend can serve his prohibitory friends in Congress, further than
                to pledge himself to abstain from the use of the narcotic poison during his abode in
                the federal city." "Sir!" exclaimed Roland, "I do not use the drug at all." "Neither
                does the son of my father," said Walter, amidst much laughter from the rich side of
                his audience. "I am prepared to denounce it. Its evils are monstrous and incal-
                culable; and I am informed by a friend on my left, a gentle- man whose name is not
                unknown to American or English ad- mirers of genius---" "Especially the English,"
                said Pollen; " a prophet is not without honor, save in his own country."' "1 True. I
                am informed, I say, that some of the brightest intellects that have illuminated the
                world by their works, have been prematurely darkened, and ultimately destroyed, by
                the pernicious stimulant. Such was the case wit iColeridge:and De Quincey-men, whose
                names can never die- To such an extent did Coleridge indulge, that the cost of' the
                drug con- sumed by him amounted to seven hundred dollars annu- ally "Huzza!" cried
                the zealous prohibitionists "he is not WALTER'S SPEECH.' 215 against us! Roland was
                mistaken!" Roland in truth was puzzled. "Against you?" continued Walter-"No! So far
                from it, I am for reforming or abolishing every evil which afflicts our race. And if
                the law can reach one of them, I contend it may be applied to all." "Certainly!"
                cried the zealous prohibitionists. "Well, then; I hold in my hand a statement made
                by some of our most eminent medical professors, declaring that the wearing of thin
                shoes causes more diseases and death, than the use of opium." "Prohibit them 1"
                cried a great many.. "And, next to thin-soled shoes, the abominable practice of
                tight-lacing produces thousands of fatal cases of consump- tion." "Abolish it! Make
                it unlawful for the women to be squeezed by any thing else than our arms " cried the
                multi- tude. "Such a law would, at least," said Walter, " be constitu- tional."
                "Good!" said Pollen, amid hearty laughter. "But if we have the power to prohibit
                such evils as I have enumerated, surely we possess the authority to reform the whole
                catalogue. Have we not?" "Yes," was the almost unanimous response. "Well, then, I
                will tell you what is the greatest evil suf- fered by man. It causes honest hearts
                to break, widows and helpless children to languish in hopeless misery; the good man
                to weep; the philosopher to complain; the poet to shiver; the watch-dog to howl--"
                "What is it? Down with it!" cried many. "It robs the virgin of her only priceless
                jewel; the noblest citizen of his honor; the honest laborer of his rest-" "What the
                d ---l is it 1 " cried a hundred shoemakers, and as many laborers on the railroad.
                "It causes men to steal, to murder, to commit suicide, and finally ingulfs them in
                eternal perdition. It is POVERTY!" "Down with it! down with it!" cried all but the
                rich, who were silent. "This parent of evils," continued Walter, "may be re- moved
                as well as the rest, and on the same principle. I pro- pose, therefore, that the

                measures the following resolutions. First: After the expiration of 'twelve months,
                it shall not be lawful for any man to possess over half a million of dollars, and
                the overplus shall go into the public treasury to educate, feed, and clothe the
                poor." This was rapturously applauded by all but two or three, who frowned
                indignantly. "Second," continued Walter-"At the end of the second year, no
                individual shall possess over one hundred thousand dollars-the surplus to be applied
                as aforesaid." This likewise was approved by nearly all present. At the end of the
                third year, no person shall have over ten thousand dollars." A vast majority
                sanctioned this, and Walter was hailed as the greatest of all reformers. "At the end
                of the fourth, no one shall possess more than one thousand dollars; but those who
                have contributed to the treasury, shall be permitted to draw upon it for the- amount
                of their expenses, of whatever kind, incident to an economical and wholesome system
                of living.", "Huzza!" cried a majority, but not more than a majority; while the rest
                manifested their disapprobation by hisses. "After that," continued Walter, "no man
                shall possess over five hundred dollars--" Here his voice was lost in the storm of
                hisses and groans that issued from all parts of the house; the opponents of any
                further reform being evidently in the majority. "That's going a little too far,"
                said a carpenter. "We, who go with our sleeves rolled up, have, many of us, more
                than that sum already, and we expect to increase it." "No, my friends," said Walter
                with sudden impetuosity, "Iet us not stop short of a thorough reform. Let us eradi-
                cate the evils which have cursed every community in almost every age and country.
                Let us be Christians in reality; let us abolish individual titles-let us give up all
                into a common treasury, and live in social equality, like a vast harmonious family,
                and be henceforth truly brothery " "That's d- d nonsense!" said the carpenter, the
                shoe- makers, and the railroad laborers. "He would have us mess with the niggers!"

                cried Walter, with earnest enthusiasm, " until you have heard me through. I rejoice
                in the manifestations I have witnessed---" "We have condemned you," said a voice.
                "No, sir; it was announced that my speech was to be in opposition to the extravagant
                projects of the fanatical reform- ers; and I think it has not been without its
                effect " Listen!" shouted the people. "He was not in earnest! He is not in favor of
                any such nonsense!" "No, fellow-citizens, I am not in favor of any such mad schemes
                of reform. If all were equal in wealth and influence to-day, it would not be so
                to-morrow. God made men with unequal powers, as the mountains and trees are of
                iiwequal dimensions. And he who attempts to extirpate evil from the world, must
                become greater than: the one who permitted it to exist, before he can expect to
                achieve success. Let our preachers and moral teachers denounce the vices they would
                suppress, and persuade such men as they can, to abandon them, for their own good,
                here and hereafter, as a matter of conviction and duty: but let them beware, that
                they do not erect an inquisition which will torture themselves'! Human laws cannot
                prevent men from destroying themselves, and going to hell, if they see proper. Like
                the Jacobins of France, the silly reformers in our country,.if they possessed the
                power, would, after destroying the fabric of liberty, and overthrowing the
                foundations of society, prey upon themselves. The same principle which would prevent
                a man from keeping opium in his house, would prohibit a rich man from possessing
                over a million of dollars, and a poor one from having more than fifty." "It's all a
                humbug, I believe! said the carpenter. "It is worse than that!" said Walter. "For
                some of )ur preachers are becoming politicians, while the devil is riving away their
                flocks. Reform lectures are delivered, by he lazy itinerants who levy contributions;

                Oakdale, at the conclusion of Walter's speech, ran to him, and folded him in his
                arms. Great enthusiasm per- vaded the entire assembly, and Roland was hooted out as
                a demagogue. Walter, Pollen, and even Snobson, who turned pale and begged in vain to
                be excused, were carried amid shouts of applause on the shoulders of the people to
                the widow Winkle's mansion. Old Mr. Dowly, who had been at the court-house, and
                heard every thing, had preceded the uproarious crowd to the widow's, and prepared
                her for their reception; and when the young gentlemen descended from the shoulders
                of their sup. porters, they were smilingly met by the happy American ma- tron.
                "Walter, my son," said she, after the echoes of the last round of cheers had died
                away, "I fear you have damaged the prospects of the reformers, and made Mr. Roland
                your enemy for life." "' Be just and fear not,' you know, mother. But I con- sidered
                him my, enemy before." "Why so?" asked both the widow and old John Dowly. "Because
                he has been endeavoring, to supplant me at the Colonel's," said Walter, in a low
                tone. "I did hope George Parke would be there to watch him. But he is in the city
                with Julia Nitre." It was warm, and as the party sat before the open windows, they
                were startled, from time to time, by the voice of Lowe's housekeeper, who seemed to
                be searching for some one in the street, although the darkness was intense. "Hit his
                hutterly himpossible for you to hezcape me! Whare hare you? You needn't try to ide!
                I know hevery air hof your ead! Stand still, I say, hor I'll skin you alive when I
                catch you. Why don't you speak, hand let me know where you hare?" "That is poor old
                Mrs. Edwards," said Mrs. Winkle. "Who can she be playing hide-and-seek with?"
                Waiter, who had discerned a singular thumping on the hard ground, and along the
                fence, during the speech of Mrs. Edwards, began to suspect who it was the
                pertinacious woman was pursuing. And sure enough, the next moment the head of
                Sergeant Blore was lifted slowly above the sill of the win dow, and within a few
                inches of him. r A SUFFERER AT WATERLOO. 219 "It's me. Don't give the alarm',"
                whispered Blore. "She's in chase of me, and if I'm taken, she'll show me no quarter.
                I was afraid to ring. Here she comes! Help me in!" The window was low, and by dint
                of much struggling, and with the assistance of Walter, the old war-worn veteran
                succeeded in making a lodgment in the parlor. "I must take my leave, now," said
                Snobson. "I hear the cars. Good evening, Mrs. Winkle. I did hope to have the
                pleasure of being entertained by Miss Lucy, and I am sorry she is away on a visit.
                Please give my respects to her when she comes home. Father says if the Arums had
                only the standing of the Winkles--but no matter-good night." "He's an irreclaimable
                puppy!" said Pollen, as Snobson withdrew hastily. "He talk of being entertained, and
                about the high circles I Why, I have heard his grandfather was a porter on the
                wharf, and rolled about the sugar hogsheads in his shirt-sleeves." "I received your
                letter, sergeant," said Walter, "and must apologize for not answering it. But you
                know I had to prepare my speech." "I know-I know; and a famous good one it was, You
                gave the Jacobins a first-rate lashing." "Sergeant," said Pollen, "how is it that
                you are a Frenchman in every thing but your nativity? Are you an American, or an
                Englishman?" "An American, sir. My father was a sea-captain, and accompanied
                Napoleon to Egypt. I was with him, and ran away to follow the fortunes of the- great
                general. I was hid two days in the pyramids, sir." "That is a solution of the
                mystery. And I am told you were among the sufferers at Waterloo." "I lost some of my
                limbs there, sir; but I always thought I had been extremely lucky, sir, by my losses
                there, until lately." The sergeant," said Mrs. Winkle, "thought he had lost Mrs.
                Blore in that engagement." "I curse my evil stars," said Blore, "that she escaped.
                She is . inglish, sir, as you might have known, if you had been listening a while
                ago." " Oh, it was her I heard in the street?" "Where's my husband? His he hat your

                middle of the street. "Hist! Don't betray me, madam!" said the sergeant. "Which one
                of your husbands, Mrs. Edwards?" asked Walter. "My first usband." "If your first
                husband be living," continued Walter, "I would advise you not to confess it. You may
                be liable to prosecution for bigamy, and you know the penalty." This was succeeded
                by a long silence, and no doubt the old woman had retreated in alarm. "Thank you,
                Walter!" said Blore. "I won't forget this good service. A discharge from your
                battery has effectually repulsed her. But I want to tell you the condition of the
                siege at your uncle's." "What is the matter there, sergeant?" asked Mrs. Win- kle.
                "You need not hesitate to speak-all here are my brother's friends." "Why, you see,
                madam, we were making preparations to have the battle of Waterloo over again, when
                she-I mean the commander's spouse-countermanded it, and would not consent to the
                engagement, unless the general would first make his will. That was no unreasonable
                thing in itself, and he was perfectly willing to, if it could be done without giv-
                ing her cause of offence. You know, madam, he never gives offence to any one, and
                especially to the ladies. And some- how or other his diplomatic wife has wheedled
                him most amazingly, so that he cannot resist her will. And when her will was made
                known, there was nothing for it but to embrace it in his will, although he said, and
                every one knew it before, that he loved Walter, as his own son and heir. So I got
                Baw- son, the Scotch lawyer, to join the conference, and -propose a compromise, or
                modification of the articles, so that Walter should not be left out entirely." "Very
                kind of you, sergeant," said Mrs. Winkle. "And what did Bawson suggest?" "That, in
                the event of the commander's death, all the per- sonal estate, of whatever kind,
                should go to Walter, and the real estate to his spouse." "That was a Scotch
                stratagem!" said Mrs. Winkle. "For I suppose he knew, that in the event of my
                brother's NAPOLEON'S WILL DISCUSSED. 221 decease, without children of his own, the
                real estate, by virtue of Mr. Winkle's father's will, must descend to my children."
                '"And so," continued the sergeant, in great glee, "the catamount would be cut out
                altogether I Yes, Bawson knew it-but the smart woman don't know any more about such
                matters than one of Bill Dizzle's frogs." "I will not be a party to any such
                deception," said Wal- ter. "If he were to execute such a will, and there should be
                an heir afterwards, it would be a fraud to possess the estate." "You are the soul of
                honor, Walter I " said the sergeant. "But you know that woman stormed the garrison
                to get at the military chest-and sioe has no just title to any part of the
                treasures. You needn't have any thing to do with it, though. Only be silent. She
                keeps the will locked up, and I think as soon as it is signed and witnessed, she'll
                not care a bayonet how quick your uncle is killed. He knows all about the mat- ter
                of the reversion, and is delighted at the idea of cheating the stinging witch. I
                believe he would be willing to die, just to witness her disappointment, if he could
                be certain he would have the power of seeing it." "What, has he caught a Tartar?"
                asked Pollen. "I believe he has," said Mrs. Winkle. "Believe? Gad, he knows it!"
                said Blore. "She don't scold him, as my wife did me-and of course she don't strike
                him; but there is such a terror in- her frown, such a misery in her cold looks, that
                he would submit to any thing rather than offend her. By some infernal spell or
                other, she has conquered him! If she but cracks her finger, he runs up to her like a
                cowed spaniel-if she puckers up her thin lips, he will abandon any resolve. * Oh, it
                is a monstrous tyranny!" "She must possess some supernatural power," said Pollen.
                "She has the devil at her beck, sir!" said Blore. "Even the chickens, the bull, and
                the bull-dog, run away from her." "No wonder, then," said Walter, " my poor uncle is
                obe- dient! But is it not strange, sergeant, that any brave man should be so craven
                as to submit to the constraint of a mere woman?" "It is so!" "Then why do you fear
                Mrs. Edwards, or Mrs. Blore, as she now may be called?" "She's a h-llcat She's not a

                bless you I wait till you are lashed to an ill-natured, keen-sighted,
                iron-nerved----" "Oh, I shall profit by your example, sergeant, and keep out of
                their clutches." "Do. But shall your uncle sign?" "He must do as he pleases. I shall
                be content." "Very well. That's all he wished me to ascertain. And when the
                preparations are completed, he desires you to wit- ness the Waterloo field of
                battle. He means to show how the battle might have been won; and he'll want your
                assistance, and your friend will be welcome, too. Good night. I will scale the rear
                wall." But the sergeant was commanded by the widow to remain, deeming it out of the
                question for him to attempt to return on so dark a night. He consented to remain
                till the first dawn of light in the morning, hoping to escape the vigilant eyes of
                his watchful enemy. Walter and Pollen, the latter expressing a desire to visit
                Napoleon Winkle's country mansion, proposed to returnwith him in the morning as an
                escort. This assured the sergeant of his safety, and he expressed his gratitude in
                the language of ear- nestness. And after receiving the assurance of Mrs. Winkle,
                that it would be quite impossible for his dreaded wife to mo- lest him in his new
                quarters, he retired to the chamber in the attic, which had been allotted him. But
                he had not been long absent, before he rushed down stairs again, as fast as his
                wooden leg would permit, declaring that his wife, or some other infernal woman was
                in his room. Mrs. Winkle laughed heartily at the sergeant's narration of what he had
                seen by the light of the newly risen moon. She assured him it was only one of
                Biddy's gowns, hanging near the bed. It was removed; and then the sergeant closed
                his eyes with a sense of security. s. PEDIGREE OF C' THE GUSSETS." 223 CHAPTER XXI.
                "OWE, WALTER, AND POLLEN PAY A VISIT TO GRI8ELDA. THE BAT- TLE OF WATERLOO FOUGHT
                OVER AGAIN BY NAPOLEON WINKLE. GRISELDA only awaited the impending execution of the
                will for a perfect realization of her ambitious projects. For the present her own
                will was paramount, but she desired the con- summation of a provision for the
                future. Already, and in anticipation of the position and power, to which, from the
                first dawn of her good fortune, she plainly perceived she must arrive, she had
                consulted the best author- ities in style and fashion, as to the mode of living and
                manners to be observed, by one in her enviable station. Of course, every thing was
                British and European. First, researches were made in her genealogical line, and it
                was found that one of . her ancestors, two or three genetations removed, had been a
                captain. He had been called Captain-whether it was in the militia, or on a ferry
                boat, or in the night watch, made no dif- ference--.she was the descendant of
                Captain Gusset; and as dead men tell no tales, she might say what she pleased in re-
                gard to his gallant exploits, without danger of contradiction. Her pedigree
                established, all other impediments vanished. British novels taught her the mode of
                luxurious living, and the etiquette to be observed by a lady of her affluence. And
                besides, there were American writers-though foppish, fash- ionable-who had obtained
                access to the aristocratic circles of British society, and whose published volumes
                described the domestic habits of lords and ladies. From such sources Griselda
                learned when to retire, when to rise, what to eat, how to dress, and other small
                particulars of an aristocratic establishment. That it was desirable the fashions of
                Europe should prevail in our country, would be inferred from the fact that
                government did nothing for the encouragement of teach- ers of an indigenous growth,
                while the foreign authors, de- frauded of their property, nevertheless had their
                sentiments expanded throughout the Republic, involving the readers in no further
                expense than the mere cost of paper and printing. And Griselda was only one among
                the millions who imbibed a relish for the effeminate and free enjoyments of life,
                such as <pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6922-00000118"/> 224 THE WINKLES. some of the British novelists demonstrated as
                being in vogue in the vicinity of Grosvenor Square, and other noted places in the
                west end of London. It was, therefore, with feelings of most exquisite delight, that
                Griselda beheld Walter and his two friends approaching the mansion. Lowe, although
                the subject of dark suspicions, and sometimes of conjectures of an opposite
                character, was certainly a mysterious personage-but against whom nothing could with
                certainty be alleged. He was young and hand. some-accomplished and generous; and
                these more than suf. ficed, as Griselda learned from the practice in Harley street,
                Cavendish square, for his reception in the boudoirs of the most distinguished
                American ladies. -Pollen was a poet, and in all ages and countries, but ours, the
                poets were freely ad-. mitted into the best society. And Griselda resolved to con-
                tribute her mite, in condemnation and ridicule of every thing merely American. She
                had learned from Walter that Pollen was read and approved in England; and that if he
                had but the means to defray his expenses thither, he would be imme- diately caressed
                by the Sutherlands, the Stanhopes, the Spences, the Beauforts, etc. Walter, himself,
                when he chose to be smiled upon by her, had always been a sort of privileged pet of
                the retired milliner. Refreshing her memory of similar visits in the fashionable
                novels, Griselda conformed to them as nearly as possible in the reception of the
                young gentlemen; and they soon had reason to be convinced they were heartily welcome
                to the hos- pitalities of the mansion. "It was kind in you, Walter," said Griselda,
                when they were seated, " to think of your languishing friend, in her deep seclusion.
                I have just been reading one of Mr. -'s tales of the country enjoyments in England,
                and wondering why we did not imitate such pleasant examples. There is nothing to
                prevent it. We have here all the means of similar delights. Let us improve them.
                Promise me, all of you, that you will be my guests for a week or a fortnight, at the
                very least, and I will devise means for your amusement." "What have you to say,
                Pollen?!" asked Walter. "I shall be perfectly willing to remain until driven hence.
                You know I have no fixed home-no regular employment- and if Mrs. Winkle will permit
                me to enjoy myself in my THE POET IN THE SEVENTH HEAVEN. 225 own way when the fit
                comes on-and you can explain what that means-I shall be honored by her
                entertainment." "No explanation is necessary," said she. "This is Liberty. Hall. Do
                as you please. Command what you desire, and consider every thing your own. If a fit
                of composition, such as used to seize upon Lord Byron, should take possession of
                you, depend upon it, you shall not be disturbed. I should like, above all things, to
                read a poem in print, which had been written in my house." "Very considerate,
                truly," said Lowe. "If the poet does not now consider himself invested with the
                freedom of the place, he can have no appreciation of handsome receptions." "I thank
                you, Mr. Lowe, for your kind remark," said Griselda; " and I really wish you would
                spend a large portion of your time at the mansion, during the absence of----" Who?"
                asked Pollen. "The lord of the estate?" "Oh, no! A certain young lady, who has
                mysteriously disappeared," replied Griselda. "Do, sir," said Pollen. "The walks
                about the premises are silent and romantic, and adapted to passionate musing. I
                shall enjoy them. Oh, the joyous air, perfumed with roses! and the carollings of
                happy birds! I must rush out in their midst. Who will accompany me? Who will follow?
                Ex- cuse me!" and he darted through one of the long windows descending to the floor,
                and crossing the lawn, disappeared be- hind a hedge of altheas. Walter, leaving Lowe
                with his aunt, sought his uncle in the library. He was in the midst of charts and
                papers, with pen in hand, making a diagram of the field of Waterloo. "Come to my
                arms, my boy " he cried, embracing his nephew, and evincing the real delight his
                presence afforded. "I am glad to see you so happy, uncle, and that you have resumed
                your cherished employments." "Sit down. Wait a moment," said the old gentleman,
                tripping lightly across to the door, which he locked. "I am free, now," he
                continued, in a low voice. "How I became en- tangled in the silken meshes of
                matrimony, we will not dwell upon; suffice it, that I was bound hand and foot, but
                now am free. I kept a subtle poison about my person, to take in the last extremity;
                but that Scotch lawyer, Bawson, and our Blore, have extricated me from the clutches
                of her Machia- velian diplomacy." 10* <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6922-00000119"/> 226 THE WINKLES. "Could you not have
                ruptured the silken cord, uncle?" "No, not at all. She made no hostile
                demonstration, but assumed at the beginning the attitude of superiority, and had the
                power to withhold or grant any thing, as I might concili- ate or exasperate her. It
                is a mystery to you. But wait till a woman is appended to your neck I You will then
                find that whatever is yours, is hers, and that she may insidiously obtain the
                arbitrary direction of the whole." "I should declare war, uncle, and turn her out of
                doors!" "War against a woman? No, sir! All domestic wounds should be healed on the
                hearth-stone. But we have over. reached her in diplomacy. Every thing is signed in
                the form the sergeant described to you. Bawson has been paid and dismissed and your
                aunt has the document safely locked up in the iron chest with the plate-your plate,
                Walter. Ha, ha, ha! If I could only witness her chagrin and disappoint- ment, upon
                the discovery that she was outwitted and over- reached in the partition of my
                effects, I would swallow the strychnine to-day. Hal ha! ha! Blore is another Talley-
                rand!" "I hope you may not be induced to commit an injustice, uncle. , If there
                should be an heir--" "Hist!" said his uncle, placing his lips to the ear of his
                nephew, and whispering. "Rely upon it," he continued, "and be at ease. I shall do no
                wrong. But I mean to enjoy my enfranchisement." The repeated reference to his
                regained liberty, amused Walter, particularly when he observed so much caution and
                secrecy in his communications. "If you have been really enfranchised, uncle," said
                Wal- ter, "why do you remain in your cabinet? "Oh, I am just planning the campaign
                of the hundred days. I find fault with Napoleon's last operations, and I mean to
                demonstrate how his final calamity might have been averted. He should have first
                dislodged the British with bombs. Your mortar was the article I stood most in need
                of. I thank you for it, Walter. Rely upon my gratitude." "I suppose, sir, you will
                not have to encounter any opposi- tion from my aunt before entering upon this final
                campaign." "Bless you, no! she seems to co-operate with alacrity, and promises
                herself much enjoyment. Since the signing of the treaty, there is a great change in
                her aspect. She says GUSSET OVERREACHED. 227 the crops being all laid by, I may
                command the men in the territories; and Blore says they are eager for the fray. But
                between us, Walter," he added, in a whisper, " this concession on her part is
                attributable to the provision made for her in the event of my death; and I should
                not be surprised if she allowed me the utmost opportunity of being killed. Ha, ha
                ha! And the silly woman thinking all the time she would be my successor in the
                government!" "I must own, uncle, that were I in your stead, I should hardly be
                diverted at the contemplation of such an event." "Pooh, boy, let danger fear us;
                then it ceases to be dan- ger. That was Caesar's motto. But who accompanied you? I
                saw two others approach." Walter told him, and was pleased to learn that his friends
                would prove acceptable guests to the lord as well as the lady of- the mansion, and
                his uncle immediately proposed repairing with him to the parlor, which was done; and
                Lowe had the satisfaction of enjoying a cordial reception. The old gentle- man even
                united with Griselda in demanding a prolonged so- journ from the party, and pledged
                himself to contribute his best efforts to render them comfortable. He was listened
                to in good humor by his spouse; and both to manifest her approbation of his
                courtesy, and to convince her guests that he was in the possession of perfect
                freedom, she requested him and Walter to go in search of the poet, that the honors
                of a cordial welcome might be repeated by the master (as she said) of the house. As
                the host conducted his nephew over the grounds, he ex- plained the advantages of the
                different positions and salient points in a military point of view, and indicated
                the campaign he had selected for his grand Waterloo exhibition. It was an extensive
                pasture, where vast flocks of sheep were grazing, and was traversed in the centre by
                the trout brook that mean- dered along Mrs. Winkle's premises in the village. On
                either side of the brook there was a gradual ascent, and behind the brow of the hill
                on the right hand, it was to be supposed that Wellington and his army sought a
                shelter. "I will show you how the red-coats might have been routed from their hiding
                places," said the enthusiast. "But yonder is your friend, whom we have been
                seeking." "Yes, uncle, and he is in one of his poetical moods, peo- pling the hills
                with the creatures of his imagination." <pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6922-00000120"/> 228 THE WINKLES. "A poet might
                easily fancy this the field of Waterloo, and behold every movement of the contending
                armies. Do not interrupt him. He may-be enjoying the combat." "Not he," said Walter.
                "He would never dream of that renowned conflict while gazing upon this lovely
                scene." Pollen reclined on the hillside, in the shade of a hawthorn, and surrounded
                by sheep. His propped head had the motion of one improvising to imaginary
                shepherdesses, and his eye. dilated in abstraction, failed to distinguish any
                substantial objects. As Walter and his uncle approached, they observed that a large
                ram, who had been watching the poet for some time, now became convinced that the
                oscillations of his head could be meant for nothing less than a banter to single
                combat; and disdaining to require odds against an invader of his territory, the
                leader of the flock, after stepping backward a few paces to acquire sufficient
                impetus in the assault, aimed a furious blow, which, if it had not been for the
                capacious hat of the poet, ascending high above his head, might have put an end to
                all his musings. Nevertheless, Pollen was slightly stunned, and rolled over on his
                face. "Are you hurt?" asked Walter, running forward and lifting up his friend. "I
                know not," said Pollen. "Was it an accident? Who threw the stone?" "Stone?" iterated
                the old commander. "It was no stone. It was yonder Saxon; and he shall be restricted
                in his terri- tory, if he persists in committing such wanton aggressions. Rely upon
                that. -I believe I have the honor of shaking the hand of Mr. Pollen, the poet,"
                continued the old gentleman, "and I wish to unite with my spouse in a proper
                reception of the friend of our nephew. You will oblige us, Mr. Pollen, by
                protracting your stay with us to the utmost limits of your convenience." "It will
                afford me great pleasure, sir, to gratify your wishes, and to contribute to the
                general enjoyment. But I trust I shall not'be fated to encounter many such Saxons as
                this in my rambles." "No. He is an impudent fellow, and shall be arrested." "Oh,
                don't punish him on my account," said the poet. "They call me hard-headed, and I
                doubt not he feels the effects of his temerity." A-REVIEW. 229 As they passed
                through the orchard, the poet, who lin- gered a few paces in the rear, was assaulted
                by a turkey- cock, who brushed the ground with his wings, and strutted up to him. "I
                presume," said the poet, repulsing the charge, and listening to the gobble of his
                discomfited assailant, " that he is a Mussulman." "I think so," said Walter; " and I
                believe the boar in- habiting the woods over yonder to the north, is in the habit of
                making incursions on his territories. But I think my uncle's most formidable enemy
                is John Bull, whom you may see be- yond the marshes." "I perceive what you are
                leading to, Walter," said his uncle, in good humor, "but I care not who hears it.
                Mr. Pollen. I had an adventure - a perilous one - with my neighbor over yonder,
                which, perhaps, may not have reached your ears." "I have'not heard it, sir," said
                the poet. ! I cannot narrate the occurrence so graphically as Mr. Lowe, who
                witnessed it, and, indeed, participated in the combat. He will relate the affair to
                you when we return. How now, Blore " continued the commander, being con- fronted by
                the, sergeant, who stood under the spreading apple- tree. "If it please your honor,"
                said the sergeant, touching his cap, " the men would take it as a great favor to be
                permitted to parade on the lawn, and for you to review them there." "Too hot, too
                hot, and I'm too fat, sergeant, but you may drill them." "Yes, sir," said Blore,
                with another military salute; and turning away, he marched towards the garrison at
                Boulogne. In due time the dinner was announced, and a magnificent repast it was, for
                the mistress of the house, always fruitful in resources, even in her days of
                indigence, was now possessed of ample material to have feasted a score of lords. The
                host, upon re-entering the parlor had fallen into a most interesting conversation
                with Lowe, who had incidentally, in discussing the merits of the British at
                Waterloo, made the remark that it had been a mournful day for his family, inas- much
                as his father had fallen on that fatal field. Griselda had attracted the particular
                attention of Pollen, by some premeditated- compliment on the merits of a certain <pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6922-00000121"/>
                230 THE WINKLES. poem; and not being able to quote it from memory, she was
                nevertheless enabled to turn to the page, and thus demon- strate to the poet the
                fact that his name had not been un- known at the mansion previous to his visit
                thither. So, when they arose to proceed to the dining-room, she was escorted by the
                poet, and it was the first time in her life she had ever taken a gentleman's arm
                when proceeding to the dining-room. But such was the fashionable custom, and Walter
                looked in vain to discover any signs of embarrassment in his newly elevated aunt;
                and he was by no means piqued to find her not deficient in the etiquette of the
                table. It was at his suggestion that Griselda purchased the book, and placed it on
                her centre-table; and he had the satisfaction to learn that the Arums and Crudles
                had followed her example. And in this manner, if we may be allowed a brief digres
                sion, were the Vicar of Wakefield, and Miss Gurney's first novel, rescued from
                oblivion. A few wealthy admirers brought them into notice by their honest
                commendations, or, perhaps, they might have been lost for ever to the world. On the
                slightest incidents sometimes depend the most momentous results. The poet,
                therefore-for Griselda had perused his volumes with interest and pleasure-found an
                attentive listener, and the conversation, always brilliant when he was in the vein,
                became lively and contagious at the table. Walter, alone, seemed isolated, and could
                only fire a random shot occasion- ally. But he had contrived a stratagem in concert
                with Sergeant Blore, which he did not doubt would afford some amusement; and not
                knowing precisely when the expected announcement would be made, and having a
                voracious appe- tite, he discussed the viands heartily while the rest enjoyed their
                conversation. "And so your father fought and fell on the field of Waterloo?" said
                Mr. N. Winkle to Lowe. "He did," was the laconic reply. "On which side, Lowe?" asked
                Walter. ' On the side of his country." "You are not, I think, a Frenchman; nor did I
                know before that you were not an American. But no matter," added Walter, with a kind
                smile, "a man's a man for a' that." THE FATE OF LITERARY AMBITION. 231 "I do not
                remember the name in the lists," said Mr. Winkle, " but, perhaps, he was not a
                commissioned officer." "But he was," said Lowe. "The British officers, how- ever,
                often have many names, and the one by which my father was designated differed from
                mine." "No matter for the name. The British fought like heroes; and whatever was the
                grade of your father, hUs deeds on that day deserve a monument." "He was a colonel,
                and has a monument." Lowe's voice fell, and he seemed to make a confidential
                communication to his entertainer. "It must be the most delightful of pursuits," said
                Griselda to Pollen; "and the author should be the happiest of mortals." "He should
                be, undoubtedly," said the poet; "but he is the most miserable!" "Why is it so?"
                "Because, in every instance where there is genius, or superior merit, the author is
                the victim of the tricks of the trade, or the malignity of the envious, or of a
                combination of critics whom he has failed to conciliate. By some means or other, the
                door of the temple is barred against him, and blind fortune is cajoled from his
                path." "Truly, I was not aware of it," said Griselda, manifesting much interest in
                the subject. "And that is not all," continued the poet. "The failure to achieve
                success might be borne by men of genius, with equanimity. They find enjoyment in the
                worlds of their own creation. But they are often doomed to languish in neglect, and
                behold others, infinitely their inferiors in every respect, win both fame and
                fortune. That is the source of their greatest unhappiness. They feel, they know,
                that when their ephemeral rivals shall be forgotten; when the turf shall cover their
                persecutors and enemies; when the purifications in the lapse of time shall have
                dissipated the foul vapors that ob- scured the stars;, and-I shall not pursue the
                subject. Why should I? What boots this consciousness of a literary resur- rection?
                It is madness! It is h--11! It is this which constitutes our misery! The plaudits of
                future generations cannot reach us in the grave-our fleshess skulls cannot be
                conscious of the sounds of praise! And those who withheld from us a substantial

                buried too deeply in oblivion to be branded as oppressors. Their names will have
                been utterly forgotten." At this juncture, and when Walter had completely dined, the
                company were startled by the precipitate entrance of Bill Dizzle, with open mouth
                and protruding eyes. "Well? well?" said Mr. Winkle, dropping his knife and fork, and
                leaning back in his chair. "The water was down," said Bill, " and I was arter a
                snapping-turtle in the spatter docks- " "Well? Go on." "I heard a great splash
                behind me-----" Go on!" "And the tarnation British John Bull was arter me, and the
                whole drove of cows and heifers was following him. I split for the shore, and they
                splashed arter me. I got out and run, and they run arter me-into the meadow and out
                into the pasture-and there the Saxony ram met me and gave me a tremendous butt!"
                "What? are they in the pasture?" cried the old gentle- man, rising. "Sound the
                alarm! Where's Blore?" "He sent me here, while he aims the cannon. But all the
                cattle are now licking some salt they found on the ground." This had been Walter's
                work. "An invasion! I'll mount!" said Mr. Winkle. "Hear me!" said Griselda, rising,
                while Mr. W.'s arm was still upraised. "You are soon to have the Waterloo battle
                over again, are you not?" "Yes, my dear, you consented to it," said her lord. "Very
                well. You must have the British on the field be- fore you can engage with them; and
                they must come upon the continent before they can reach the field. Let them remain
                where they are, until your preparations are completed." "Certainly," said her lord,
                lowering his arm. "Yes, let them remain," he continued, resuming his seat.
                "To-morrow we will give them battle." "I hope, however," said Griselda, "you will
                not injure the poor animals." "The bull must be separated from the rest," said Mr.
                Winkle. "Why? I don't believe he has harmed any of them, or they would not have
                followed him to the salt. Besides, have A SECOND WATERLOO. 233 they not been on the
                island with him for several days? i do not think the poor fellow deserves the
                punishment you have been meditating." "Did he not toss me into the ditch?" asked the
                old man. "And I thought it was a frog as big as a ox," said Dizzle. "But you had
                fired on him. To-morrow, or whenever you encounter him again, remember that he is no
                coward," said Griselda, smiling. "I will remember his conduct on the former
                occasion!" said the commander. Walter's anticipation of a boisterous episode was not
                real- ized. Griselda had the power of controlling his uncle, and calming his
                military frenzy. The next day, however, both sides of the great pasture were lined
                with men and boys. Here and there an old cannon of small calibre was pointed from
                the opposing extremities of the field towards the centre. Another mortar had been
                pro- cured from the city, so that the contending armies might be upon an equal
                footing. Altogether, some fifty old muskets and fowling-pieces were collected; but
                the men were forbid- den the use of lead. The mortar, to be directed by Napoleon in
                person, was to throw its wooden balls; and the British be- yond the crest of the
                opposite hill, were to watch them, and of course avoid them. The one which was to
                reply to it, was to be aimed by Walter; but he was not to be permitted to throw back
                the balls, as his uncle, not so acute of vision as himself, might not be able t-
                elude them. He could reply only with wrapped paper balls, with just a sufficient
                weight of sand to project them across the field. The old gentleman was mounted on
                his champing steed, and seemed to scan the armies through his glass, with the in-
                terest and energy of a general upon the eve of a momentous conflict. Griselda,
                attended by the poet, occupied a position at a short distance from the scene of the
                impending struggle, and out of range of the missiles, where she could witness all
                the transactions of the day. The signal was given for the attack, and the cannon on
                the old commander's side of the field were discharged, which threw the flocks of
                sheep and cattle, occupying the intermedi- ate space between the contending parties,
                into considerable <pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6922-00000123"/> 234 THE WINKLES. confusion. The enemy not replying, being
                ensconced behind the brow of the opposite hill, Mr. Napoleon Winkle ordered his
                engineer to throw some bombs in their midst. But the engineer, pro forma, not being
                skilled either in mathematics or mechanics, had omitted to point the mortar at a
                sufficieht elevation, and hence the wooden ball was projected in a hori- zontal
                direction; and tending downward by its own specific gravity, fell among the sheep.
                It struck the large ram on the tail, as that member happened to be momentarily
                elevated, and broke it. The poor animal baa-ed in pain, and ran away towards the
                crest of the hill occupied by the British, and was followed by all the silly flock.
                "Now's your time, Blore! cried Napoleon. "Charge them at the head of your column,
                under cover of the cloud of dust-raised by the sheep." Blore drew his sword and led
                the attack, followed by a score of men, and preceded by the sheep. The enemy had not
                discharged the first gun yet, and some of the novices fol- lowing Blore, expressed a
                belief that they were either killed, or had taken to flight. But just when the old
                ram and his party had reached within a few paces of the crest, Lowe, who was with
                Walter, cried out, "Up, and at them!" which was followed by the sudden uprising of
                twenty men and boys, and a rattling dis- charge of all their pieces that would go
                off. The sheep, utterly astonished, and hopelessly panic-stricken, turned and fled,
                still following their leader, who had been completely blinded by the discharge of a
                fowling-piece. With- his eyes closed and his face-blackened, the old ram, in the
                desperation of his retrograde movement, fell upon Blore and his advancing column.
                All was in confusion-leaping, tum. bling, rolling. The men were overthrown by the
                sheep. The sheep, imitating the motions of their blind leader, who, sup- posing
                obstructions were besetting every foot of the way, at each alternate spring leaped
                high in the air, as if clearing the bayonet of a soldier. It was irresistibly
                diverting to see the whole flock leaping up continually when there was nothing to
                leap over; they followed the example of their blind captain, doubtless supposing he
                had a good reason for what he did. The attacking party, under Blore, was completely
                over- thrown. Rolling over each other, and the sheep bounding over all, while the
                enemy continued to pour upon them an in- "A RALLY." . 235 cessant tempest of cannon
                and musketry, they scampered away in all directions, pale and covered with dust. The
                sheep, still following their blind leader, rushed among the cattle under a clump of
                hawthorns, near the brook, about midway between the armies. The old bull, bellowing
                and throwing up the earth with his feet,-commenced an assault on the fugitives. The
                poor creatures were tossed up like the balls of a juggler. Two or-three at a time
                were poised in the air. They bleated distressfully. The bull bellowed, the cows
                lowed, the pigs squealed, the geese squalled, and the cannon thun- dered. Blore was
                the last of the assaulting party that returned. Whether it was attributable to his
                surpassing contempt of danger, or the difficulty of traversing the field with his
                wooden leg, no one seemed curious to know. "That was a bad business, Blore," said
                Napoleon. "I am ashamed of you." "It was not possible to do more, sir," said the
                sergeant, deprecatingly; "we charged up to their guns---" "Why didn't you spike
                them?" "Because they had reserved their fire, and then discharged their pieces in
                our faces, sir; and when the smoke cleared away, we had not a man on his feet, sir.
                Every one had fallen, sir!" "Very well, Blore. Rally'the men, and form another
                assaulting column. Have them in readiness out of range of the enemy's guns. I will
                pour another shower of shells among the rascals ensconced behind the crest of the
                hill." The mortar was worked with surprising energy, and the balls were now thrown
                in theright direction, and gave employ- ment to Walter and Lowe, and their party, in
                watching and eluding them. But the one of all others the most severely exercised,
                was Bill Dizzle. He was mounted on a wild colt, carrying a large basket in his hand.
                It was his duty to watch the wooden balls when they fell, and return them to the
                battery from which they had been thrown, to be used again. Thus was he kept flying
                from one side of the field to the other. The cannon and mortars were discharged
                incessantly The ground was canopied with smoke, and the pasture really smelt like a
                field of battle. Walter and Lowe aimed, to blow up the old gentleman's <pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6922-00000124"/>

                inserting more sand in their paper balls, and by experi- menting with their charges
                of powder, they were enabled to calculate with some accuracy where their burning
                missives might be made to fall; and soon it required the constant. attention of
                several men to extinguish the sparks that were scattered in the near vicinity of the
                powder. During all this time the bull was tossing the sheep about, and trampling on
                the pigs and geese, while several dogs, be- longing to the neighboring farms, were
                barking at his heels. "Bring up your reserves!" cried Napoleon. "We have silenced
                their guns. March in the shape of a wedge, or a triangular flock of wild geese, and
                penetrate to their rear. Let nothing arrest your progress this time." Blore advanced
                at the head of his geese to execute the command, under cover of the batteries, and
                avoiding the ground occupied by the cattle. When they had ascended the opposite hill
                nearly to the summit, the fire from the swivels and the mortar ceased, for fear of
                injuring friend as well as enemy. An ominous silence prevailed in the ranks of the
                assaulted party, which lay concealed behind the crest of the hill. "Now, lads!"
                cried Blore, when within a few paces of the crouching enemy, "remember there is no
                lead in their cartridges; and, for the honor of our commander, and in re- venge for
                being run over by the sheep, let us seize their guns, and drive them from the field.
                -Down with your bayonets! Charge!" Then Walter and Lowe, with all their men, rose up
                and poured a volley in their faces. If they did not have lead in their guns, still
                they peppered their assailants; for an ounce of pulverized pepper had been inserted
                in every cartridge. "Fury! cried Blore. "' What the d--l's this? Never mind it,
                soldiers! Shut your eyes and rush upon them!" But it so happened that each one, and
                the sergeant among the rest, had involuntarily faced about upon being peppered; and
                now, in the supposed execution of the valorous command, the whole party charged in
                the opposite direction, amid the shouts of the enemy and the loud laughter of the:
                hundreds of spectators, who had been attracted to the scene by Hte con tinuous
                discharges of guns. Vi On, soldiers, on!" cried Blorke slashing the air ith his
                STAND BY YOUR GUNS! 237 sword, and urging his blinded column down the hill, uncon-
                sciously retreating before the enemy, and yet under the sup- position that they had
                surmounted the crest of the ravine and were descending on the opposite side. In vain
                did Napoleon shout to them to return to the assault. No order could be distinguished
                in the confused roar of mingled sounds. In vain was Dizzle despatched over the field
                with a written order. The sergeant could not open his eye to read it; and in reply
                to Dizzle's repetition of the order which had been uttered by the
                commander-in-chief, Blore only urged his men the more furiously downward. When they
                reached the brook, they fell headlong in it. They scrambled out unhurt, wondering
                they had never observed the stream before in the rear of the enemy's position. But
                now the line was broken, and the discomfited party were irretriev- ably scattered in
                different directions, and about one half of them were made prisoners and conducted
                to the rear of the hostile army. "Blore! It's me-it's your general!" cried Napoleon,
                riding up to his second in command, regardless of the balls of burning paper that
                whizzed by his head; Walter and Lowe having renewed the fire from their batteries.
                "' What is the matter, Blore? Why have you returned in this manner? i" "I can't
                tell, sir," said the sergeant, rubbing his eye, and obtaining a partial view of the
                disastrous posture of affairs. "It's some new invention, sir, that Walter never told
                me about. They are always getting up something new to surprise the old folks. Every
                one of us, sir, made stone blind I We thought we were in the enemy's camp when we
                tumbled into the water. It could not be helped, sir. But the water has washed away
                some of the infernal powder! ' "Rally them once more, Blore. Bring up the old guard.
                We must take their battery, and then the battle will be won. Stand by your guns! See
                to the mortar!" cried Napoleon, in great excitement, seeing the bull approaching,
                followed by the cows and sheep. A burning ball from the enemy's mortar, had lodged
                upon one of the horns of the bull, and the smoke and pain from the sparks had
                exasperated him to such a degree, that he resolved to storm one of the batteries
                himself. That of Napoleon being the nearest, he charged boldly upon it. The mortar
                was de- pressed as he approached, and fired when he was within a few <pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6922-00000125"/>
                238 THE WINKLES. paces of it. It took effect upon his massy forehead, and was
                shivered to splinters. But Johnny was stunned, and brought to his knees. He shook
                his head in pain, closed his eyes, and snorted aloud. However, before the mortar
                could be re- charged, he had recovered his feet.' He had no thought of retreating.
                On the contrary, amid the shouts and yells of the spectators, he returned to the
                charge, and bellowing most fu. riously, with his head down and his tail erect,
                rushed upon the mortar and dislodged it. The men that had served it were overthrown
                and put to flight. Napoleon himself at- tempted to stand his ground, and slashed
                away with his sword. But his horse became ungovernable, and fled away, followed by
                the bull, who kept his eye upon the well-known red sash. "Tout present c'est fini!
                Sauvons-nous!" said Pollen, when the flying chief paused near the platform where the
                poet and Griselda were seated. "No, sir-no I It is my sash he wants, and he shall
                have it," said Napoleon, reining in his steed, and detaching the silken trophy from
                his body, which he threw upon the ground. He then wheeled away, and returned by a
                circuitous route to the battery, and was received with cheers, while the bull was
                ploughing up the earth under the sash. "What ridiculous nonsense for men to engage
                in," said Griselda. "It might do for children. I am weary of it. Let us return to
                the mansion." "Presently," said the poet. "Walter has something else in reserve. He
                may cure his uncle of his military distemper." "His uncle will be killed in some of
                these mad enterprises. I look for nothing else, and am prepared for it. What are
                they doing now?" Griselda observed that the mortar directed by Walter and Lowe had
                ceased to throw paper balls, and they were doing exe- cution with another sort of
                missile, of a more consistent sub- stance. These were pumpkins, which had been
                obtained from a neighboring field, and one of them had burst upon the head of the bu
                land blinded him. The furious animal, not able to see from Ohnce this last assault
                proceeded, was at length stricken with' Mrror, and ran away. He never paused until
                he had regaine&amp; his own territory on the island. The rest of the cattle were
                ,scattered in divers directions, lowing pit- eously. The sheep lay panting under the
                hawthorns. "There goes another," said Pollen. "Let us watch it." A SQUASH. 239 It
                made a handsome curve, and came down squash, on the bald head of Napoleon,
                overwhelming him with the seeds and other soft contents of the fruit. "Astonishing i
                " said Griselda. "I thought any thing fall- ing from such a height on one's head,
                would produce instant death. But he does not seem to be at all injured by it." If he
                was not injured, he was blinded for a time, and ceased to take any note of the
                progress of the battle. Ob- serving this, Lowe and Walter ordered a charge, and in
                turn assaulted their opponents at the point of the bayonet. The guns and the mortar
                were carried; and to crown the victory, both Napoleon and the sergeant were made
                prisoners. Thus ended the day's sports, which were followed by a sumptuous repast,
                which had been ordered by Griselda. CHAPTER XXII. SENSIBLE CALCULATIONS OF THE
                GIRLB-A DEAD RAT. THE sojourn of the young gentlemen at the Winkle mansion in the
                country was continued for more than a week, and Griselda did every thing in her
                power to make the time pass agreeably. She had invited the eldest of the Arum and
                Crudle sisters to her house, hoping by this means to increase the pleasures of her
                guests. And the heiresses had accepted the invitation, for it was not often they
                could meet with such intellectual society as might be anticipated on such an occaw
                sion. They could have no idea that Walter and Lowe had ever heard of their
                detracting remarks; and they were not averse to the re-establishment of friendly
                relations with them as the common guests of the now rich and fashionable Gri- selda.
                It was true that the mystery of Lucy's absence had never been satisfactorily solved;
                but it could be no source of discontent to the young ladies, that one so universally
                admired remained away. That Lowe had not eloped with her, was certainly a
                demonstrable fact, and his presence was an obvious refutation of the slander which
                had been circulated by Roland. Besides, the apparent friendly terms which still
                subsisted be- tween Walter and his uncle, might be an indication that the <pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6922-00000126"/>
                240 THE WINKLES. young man's prospects for the future were not entirely de- stroyed.
                As for Griselda herself, her conduct since her marriage had been marked and
                commended by the Arums and Crudles. She had cut all her poor acquaintances except
                such as might be of immediate use, and had sought the intimacy of the rich or the
                fashionable. But although the girls were quite delighted with the com- pany of the
                young gentlemen, and exerted their powers of fascination to enthrall them, yet it
                might have been easily perceptible that they had no design of forming a matrimonial
                entanglement with the precipitancy which had characterized the case of young
                Snobson, whose father was so exceedingly wealthy. In their thoughts, and even in
                their conversation, when alone, the merits and pecuniary prospects of the young men
                were freely discussed. Walter might prove worth catching some day, and their bearing
                towards htn was to be governed in view of such a contingency. Lowe was a mystery,
                and most young ladies are fond of mysteries. If no one knew any thing about him, how
                was it to be ascertained that he might not really be the possessor of an ample
                fortune? He was certainly handsome and accomplished, and seemed to be familiar with
                the manners and habits of the most aristocratic circles. It was prudent, therefore,
                to maintain friendly relations with him in reference to any developments which might
                be exhibited in the future. But as for the poor poet, his was a hopeless pre-
                dicament. No one of his unlucky avocation had ever been known, so far as the
                information of the Arums and Crudles extended, to win distinction and influence in
                society based upon the only foundation of which they had any conception- viz.,
                fortune. But he had access to the wealthiest families, and he might immortalize a
                young lady's name in a poem, and hence they condescended to be amiable, and to amuse
                them- selves by their praises of his genius. But if he had possessed the genius of a
                Shakspeare, and had been devoid of fortune, not one of the Arums or the Crudles
                could have entertained for a moment the idea of marrying him. But Griselda, On the
                other hand, although irrevocably disposed of in matrimony, made unceasing efforts to
                gratify his vanity. This, she learned from British novels, and from American writers
                who imitated the European authors, was the practice of the high bred and
                aristocratic ladies of England.. In truth, so affectionately did THE SUCCESSFUL
                CANDIDATES. 241 she sympathize with him in his real or imaginary wrongs, and in the
                often-expressed desire to possess 'the pecuniary ability to conduct a magazine under
                his own control, that she insisted upon his becoming her debtor for a sum sufficient
                to defray the expenses of the first number of the periodical. Pollen, as may be
                supposed, readily acceded to the request. "Meantime the election had taken place,
                and Roland had been defeated, as was predicted by John Dowly. Mr. Plastic the
                opposing candidate was returned by a large majority, and he had the candor to
                acknowledge his obligations to Walter, whom he sought at his uncle's mansion. He not
                only owned that he was indebted to the young man for his election but declared his
                purpose to serve him when he arrived at the federal city. Colonel Oakdale was
                elected a member of the State legis- lature, and his subsequent election to a seat
                in the United States Senate was deemed highly probable. Roland bore his
                disappointment and chagrin with an as- sumed equanimity of temper, but with a secret
                determination to be revenged on the author of his defeat. He had reason to believe
                that Walter had been long enamored of Virginia, Colonel Oakdale's daughter, and he
                could not avoid a supposi- tion that the partiality was reciprocal. But a desire to
                ex- empt the lady from unhappiness, was not so powerful a motive in his breast as
                the inclination to punish the young man; therefore he resolved to put his scheme in
                immediate execu- tion. It was while Walter still remained at the Winkle mansion,
                that Roland made one of his formal visits to the colonel's residence. If the colonel
                at first regarded his visitor with dread and apprehension-for it occurred to him
                that he might demand the payment of the debt of ten thousand dollars under the sting
                of his political disappointment-he was soon unde- ceived; and upon observing that
                the attention of his guest was bestowed almost entirely as usual upon his daughter,
                he mani- fested his delight in every conceivable way, and assured Ro- land that no
                one could be a more welcome suitor than himself. To manifest his approbation, and
                his confidence in the unsuc- cessful candidate, the colonel proposed to sally forth
                alone in quest of woodcock, his favorite game. Roland made not the slightest
                objection, and impatiently awaited his departure. One of the colonel's most
                remarkable peculiarities was a passion for the fresh air of heaven; and hence his
                desire to " <pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6922-00000127"/> 242 THE WINKLES. be in the woods and fields as much as
                possible. And if he was delighted to be out in the wholesome atmosphere where he
                could enjoy the perfumes of blossoms, it followed very na. turally that he had a
                nose peculiarly sensitive to unpleasant odors. On the very morning of the arrival of
                Roland at Oakdale Hall, the colonel imagined that something offensive and
                deleterious was concealed about the house, which sent a disagreeable effluvium into
                most of the apartments. He had on his velvet hunting coat, and held his gun in his
                hand, when the stench became so great, that he paused, and ordered every one in the
                house to seek the cause of the insufferable annoy. ance. It-had not been discovered,
                however, before the depar. ture of the colonel. The colonel, by a natural
                conjuncture of ideas, while striding over his grounds, and meditating on the
                importance of securing an ample provision for his daughter, bethought him'of his
                young proteg6, Walter Winkle, and of the many instances of his manifestations of
                approval of the intimacy that subsisted between him and Virginia. Now, if Roland had
                any serious idea of a matrimonial alliance with his family- a political one was out
                of the question, and the colonel would have perished at the stake before violating a
                principle-it was plain that no such purpose ought to be entertained by Walter. He
                despised Roland's politics; he approved Walter's princi- ples. But the one was rich
                and the other poor; and Walter, as a rational creature, and as the friend of
                Virginia, would see at once the benefit the young lady would derive by a re- jection
                of his hand and an acceptance of Roland's. The col- onel, accustomed to see his
                views instantly adopted by all within the sphere of his influence, did not deem it
                necessary to conjec- ture what might be the opinion of his daughter on the subject.
                But he determined to confer frankly with Walter; and for that purpose he directed
                his steps toward the Winkle man- sion. Walter was lounging in the portico when he
                saw the colonel approach with his dog and gun. He started up with symptoms of
                delight, for he was growing weary of his aunt's hospitalities. Pollen had gone to
                the city to issue the first number of his magazine; Lowe was spending most of the
                pleasant hours of the day creeping alone, or with Bill Dizzle, through the bushes on
                the margin of the brook, in pursuit of the trout; Napoleon was planning new
                campaigns; and the Arums and Crudles were A DAY'S SHOOTING. 243 detailing the
                enjoyments they anticipated the next winter in the fashionable circles of New York,
                whither their parents had agreed, for the first time, to permit them to sojourn for
                a brief season, in imitation of certain belles whose fortunes had been inherited.
                "Get a gun and come along with me, Walter," said the colonel. "Willingly," -replied
                Walter. "But come in and have a glass of water, while I am selecting a gun." "Yes,
                Colonel Oakdale!" cried Griselda,"( come in. Bring ice water. Sit down, colonel. You
                know my guests." "To be sure I do. They are famous throughout the country." "Oh, la,
                Colonel Oakdale," said the young ladies, "what a flatterer!" i "Not I. Curse the
                water-that is, the water alone--" said the colonel, to the servant. "Bring the
                brandy. I know the law don't allow me to drink it-but am I not a law maker?" "And a
                law breaker," added Miss Arum, laughing heartily at the joke. "Yes," replied the
                colonel, drinking, " and a law breaker. It proves what I have always said, that
                nothing could be more demoralizing than to enact laws which will not be observed. It
                breeds a habit of violating the statutes, and the ultimate consequences may be more
                calamitous than the reformers are aware of." "No doubt you are perfectly right,"
                said Griselda. "But colonel, why has not Virginia been to see me?" "Oh, she is
                coming soon! She would have been here several days ago, but hesitated, because
                several unmarried gentlemen were among your guests; and she thought it might be
                supposed by some she was husband hunting." "I should be sorry if any one supposed
                that was my ob- ject!" said Miss Arum. "And it would be a false supposition if
                applied to me!" said Miss Crudle. "I'm ready, colonel," said Walter, coming in with
                a gun slung on his back. "Very well," said the colonel, rising. "But," he con-
                tinued in a low voice to Griselda, "are you not annoyed by dead rats? At my house
                the stench is insufferable. It seems <pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6922-00000128"/> F44 THE WINKLES. to'me I have smelt
                something of the kind since I have been here. I can't imagine what could have killed
                them at so many different places, and at the same time." "I do think I can perceive
                it now," said Griselda. "I do, very distinctly," said Walter. "Has any poison been
                thrown about?" "No! certainly none that I know of," said his aunt. "It -grows
                stronger and stronger," said the colonel. "Come, Walter; we will leave the ladies to
                smell it out." And when the gentlemen departed, the ladies loudly mani- fested their
                horror of the disagreeable odor, which was really painfully disagreeable. But they
                vainly sought the cause of it. "I believe," said the colonel, leading the way
                through the orchard, "your dead rat must be a larger one than mine. I can smell it
                yet. We must get terriers, and not poison them. Walter!" he continued, placing his
                hand on the young man's shoulder, "what do you suppose I have been thinking about
                all day?" "The first speech you will deliver in the U. S. Senate." "No-though I
                think I shall make one there-a good, honest, American speech." "Then I cannot
                conjecture what it is, unless it be how to pay the $10,000 you owe Roland, the
                disappointed candidate." aThat is pretty close shooting. You came near the mark
                there. Guess again." "Perhaps you have been thinking that when you arrive in
                Washington, you may prevail on the President to appoint me secretary of legation at
                London." "Eh? No, I didn't think of that; but I should have done it. I will do it,
                Walter! Your ideas have been caught up and spread all over the State. The President
                must give you the appointment, if he wishes to gratify me. You have my word that the
                appointment shall be conferred on you, if my influence. will suffice. You know my
                word is never lightly uttered, and my promises never forgotten. I may fall out with
                you, and even hate you, if such a thing were possible- or you might hate me, which
                would be a more reasonable thing still, I would urge the justice of your claims with
                none the less zeal and pertinacity." "I am sure of it, sir. And truly such an office
                would be extremely gratifying to me. You know I am poor, sir, and I HAVE A DAUGHTER.
                24, o ( young; and I might derive benefit from such an appointment, before I marry
                and become permanently settled." "True.-Look out! I missed him!" said the colonel,
                seeing the cock he firod at enter an impenetrable grove of cedars. "Marriage, in
                your present condition, is out of the question, unless you could make up your mind
                to take one of the Arums or Crudles." i Ha, ha, ha! I shall desire somethibg more
                than the prospect of a share of an estate on the death of my wife's father." "I
                didn't suppose they would suit you. You deserve a better fate." "Be that as it may,
                I hope a better fate is in reserve for me." "I hope so-I hope so-and I shall always
                hope so, even if we should become enemies. And even in that event, as I said before,
                I am resolved to get you the appointment." "Enemies! Why do you repeat that word,
                colonel? Such a contingency is not at all supposable. We have never dif- fered about
                any thing in our lives." "I know it-and hence I fear, if we should differ hereafter
                the rupture will be a violent and irremediable one." I "Colonel, such a case is not
                probable. We can never fall out, I am quite sure." "We'll see. I'll try you. But I
                tremble almost; for I love you, Walter. I have a daughter, you know." "Yes, I know
                it." "You dog, you, I am sure you do! She is a dutiful girl, a handsome girl, a
                spirited girl, a-" "Colonel, you needn't repeat the catalogue of her good qua-
                lities to me. I know them as well as you do-perhaps better. If--" "No ifs. It's no
                such thing. You are mistaken. An- swer me, briefly: Have I not always encouraged the
                intimate friendship which subsisted between you and Virginia?" "Yes, sir." "True.
                But did I ever say you should have my consent to marry her? Turn your face away like
                I do, and answer me." "No, colonel, I must admit that." "True. But has there not
                been reason to suppose youlooked forward to such a consummation, and that you
                desired it?' "I cannot deny it." <pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6922-00000129"/> 246 THE WINKLES. "Now we come to the point!
                Then, if I should withhold my consent, would you not fall out with me-despise me-be-

                parent should possess. So far from being offended, sir, I should attribute your
                conduct to a laudable desire to secure the happiness of your child. I am without
                fortune; your estate is, I know, encumbered with debt; and your motive would be to
                avert the evils of an incompetency "You are a noble boy, Walter!" said the colonel,

                You understand my condition thoroughly. But-but-suppose I were to promote a match
                with one of larger possessions?" "I have already said I shall seek something besides
                for. tune when H" "Oh, I don't mean you-but Virginia." "Virginia?" "Yes, Virginia."
                "Virginia marry a rich man?" "Yes! Why the deuce are you so much astonished at it?"
                "Oh, if she were so disposed-- "Of course it could never take place without her
                consent. But if she were to consent to such a thing, in obedience to my request,
                would you have a rupture with me?" "No, sir! If she consented to it, I should have
                no re. preaches to utter!" replied Walter, sadly. "She would have to consent to it
                before it could take place. You don't suppose me capable of compelling my daughter
                to wed any one repugnant to her?" "No, sir; I do not suppose any thing of the sort.
                And I admit a father, and an only surviving parent, should have the power of
                preventing a marriage which is displeasing to him." "Why, we understand one another
                perfectly! Remember I have no right to force Virginia to marry against her will,-
                and she has no right to wed without my consent. ' That is rea- aonable, and I shall
                agree to it. If she opposes my will, I shall have the advantage of her." "How so,
                sir?" A BAT. 247 "Why, she may die an old maid-and t have no disposi- tion to marry
                again." "Very true. But in the mean time, I hope I shall not be forbidden her
                company?" "No. That would be mean and tyrannical. Hang me if I haven't brought you
                to my house, without knowing where I was going-and yonder is Dash setting a bird a
                mile off! No matter, Walter; since we have agreed not to disagree. But I haven't
                told you who it is I have my eye upon -" "You are looking at the dog, sir!" "You are
                a sly, sarcastic rogue! I suspect that had a double meaning. But he is with Virginia
                now." "Who?" "Roland." "Roland! Oh, very well, sir. He is rich. He is fond of the
                society of ladies. I have not a word to say, sir, why he should not be the man. I
                will not say a word to injure him, sir. Let him propose. Let him do his best. You
                have said you will not constrain her----" "Yes, I have said it-and that's enough.
                You shall not be turned out of doors; don't apprehend any thing of the kind. But
                don't quarrel with him. Calm your excite- ment -" "Am I excited?" "Do flashes of
                lightning indicate a cloud? But you can't see your own face. Come in. There's the
                cursed rat again! I'll find it, or tear the house down. Oh, I'll lead you into the
                parlor, since you are so pale." And when they entered, if the colonel had cast his
                eyes toward his daughter's face, he might have seen more flashes. Doubtless, Roland
                had been urging his suit; but from the manner in which Virginia greeted Walter, that
                young gentle- man felt assured his rival was not likely to succeed imme- diately.
                "Don't you smell a rat?" asked the colonel, sitting beside Roland. 'I certainly do
                perceive a disagreeable odor, colonel, since you mention it; but I have not observed
                it before." "That proves you have been agreeably entertained; for I smelt it before

                Look under the sofas and the sideboard. Tear up the floor. The cursed rat is in this
                room, or near it, I'm sure, and it must be found, or I'll burn down the house!" The
                servants came in, and looked every where in vain. "Massa," said Tom, an emancipated
                slave from the Old Dominion, "it's nigh you. I can scent like a dog, and I track it
                to you." "Track it to me, you infernal fool! What do you mean?" "I'll 'splain,
                massa. You killed one woodcock last week--" "Yes, last week; and I have iot killed
                any since." "That's de truf, massa! Did massa eat 'im?" "No! Cook, why didn't you
                serve up the cock I killed last week?" "I nebber seed it." "Never-" "Stop, stop,
                massa!" said Tom. "I'll 'splain. My nose is right. Don't be 'fended, massa," he
                continued, inserting his hand into one of the pockets of the colonel's hunting-coat,
                and pulling out the woodcock, in an advanced state of decom- position. The truth
                was, the colonel had never taken the bird from his pocket; and although he
                recollected the fine shot which brought him down, he had forgotten every thing else.
                He rushed out of the room and threw off his cqat, while Vir- ginia and her rival
                suitors were convulsed with laughter. When the colonel returned, in another dress,
                he perceived his daughter at the piano, and a suitor on each side of her. Virginia,
                like most of her sex, seemed amused at the assidui- ties of the rivals; but could
                not restrain her merriment when, ever and anon, the thought of the rat recurred to
                her. "Sing something sad and pensive, Virginia," said her father. "Yes, father,"
                said the laughing girl; "and I will thank you for deciding what it shall be. These
                gentlemen have been naming the songs they are partial to, and they are so
                dissimilar, I know not which to oblige, fearing to offend the other. But if I can
                please you, I care not who may be dis- pleased." "That's a good daughter. Sing me,
                then, a Scotch song." She did so, and was assisted by Walter. A SONG. 249 Sailor.

                It is a good song. You should learn to sing, Roland. It is a fine accomplishment.

                have an irresistible desire for a lonely, contempla. tive walk." "Walter," said
                Virginia, when the colonel had departed, "my father will never again refer to your
                adventure in the city, for fear you will retaliate with the tale of the rat." "I
                will retaliate with that tale if he does. I will detail it and retail it, as often
                as he refers to my adventure." "May I have the slightest hint of the nature of the
                ad- venture?" asked Roland. "Oh, yes," said Virginia; ' he can't retaliate on me.
                You will not be offended?" she continued, addressing Walter, archly. "No, not at
                all-if you tell every thing; what was found in the barrel, and all." "No, you must
                tell it." "C Another time will answer," said Roland, with an air of indifference;

                not to betray any of his secrets. He was met by the colonel on the lawn, and a long
                conver- sation ensued between them, and in view of the parlor window, in the recess
                of which stood Virginia and Walter. "What was it he whispered, if I may be so bold?"
                said Walter. "You saw--" "I did." "What, a whisper What did it look like? But,
                really, I have a great secret-one 'that will make you exceedingly pale when you hear
                it. Your hair will stand up, and perhaps turn gray. Do you think you can bear to
                hear it now? or would it not be better to prepare you for the disclosure, by a
                little tantalizing suspense?" "I will forestall you. I know it already; and,
                perhaps, more of it than you do. He is a suitor for your hand, and your-father has
                sanctioned his pretensions." "And so my father has made a speech to you, too? Well,
                the agony of the first interview with my proposed husband is over." "Virginia! tell
                me-won't you tell me what passed be- tween you before I came in? What did he propose
                What did you say " AN OFFER OF MARRIAGE. 251 "He proposed to marry me." (And what
                did you say?" "I was silent." "Silent? Heavens, Virginia! did you not know how he
                would interpret your silence? He will consider you irrevo. I cably bound to him! Why
                did you not speak?" "I could not trust myself. - I did not like to give vent to an
                outhurst of anger, and it would have been highly improper to laugh outright-both of
                which inclinations seized me al- ternately." "But what did you think of him?" "I
                thought he was a fool! To suppose that a desire to possess his wealth could induce,
                or the fear of his vengeance constrain me to lend a favorable ear to his audacious "
                I'll--" began Walter, starting forward. "No you won't! He had a right to say what he
                did; and unless you promise not to have a quarrel with him, I may ac- cept him." "I
                promise," said Walter, resuming his position at her side. "Now you will not accept
                him? "No, I will not." "But if your father desires it " "He will not desire it, if
                it be repugnant to my inclina- tion-which it is, and ever will be. I said I made no
                reply to Roland. I did not; your arrival interrupted the interview. But a reply was
                burning on my tongue I intended to say- but it would have displeased my father, and
                I am glad I did. not utter it." "What was it? Pray, let me hear what it was you in-

                constraint." "No; he promised me that, and he will not disregard his word." "And so
                you extorted that promise from him? He de- clared the same to me, before I could be

                have agreed to see him whenever he comes, and to give him an opportunity to win me,

                not the ability. I shall amuse myself at his expense." "Virginia, beware of the arts
                of that man!" "Art has nothing to do with it; it is nature. One Winkle to a thousand

                almost as much by the colonel as by his daughter; and hence, although Roland had
                just intimated a wish that his youthful rival, destitute as he was, might not be so
                freely entertained as formerly, yet was Walter, in accord- ance with the colonel's
                custom, pressed to remain at the man- sion the remainder of the day. And the
                invitation was so earnestly given, and so sweetly seconded by the glances of
                Virginia, that the young man felt incapable of tearing himself away. Mr SEEKING
                OFFICE. 253 CHAPTER XXIII. WALTER TAKES LEAVE OF HS AUNT-THE WIDOW WINKLE'S HOUSE
                SOLD OVER HER HEAD. IT was winter. The Arums and Crudles had extorted suffi- cient
                money from their parents, to defray the expenses of a two months' residence in New
                York. They stopped a whole day at a fashionable hotel, that their names might be an-
                nounced in the newspapers; afterwards they moved to a fash- ionable up-town
                boarding-house. They had no relations in the city but some poor cousins-and the
                Arums and Crudles likewise, were cousins-whom they had long since ceased to
                associate with on familiar terms. The father of their New York cousins, was a small
                tradesman; he kept a shop, and sold ladies' shoes. Mr. Poke was poor; and of course
                he did not even have the custom of his wealthy relations from Babbleton, much less
                their social visits. Congress having assembled, Walter resolved to try his fortune
                at Washington, whither Mr. Plastic had written in his behalf to the President; and
                there seemed some prospect of success; at least such was the purport of- ne of the
                replies signed by the President's private secretary. Lowe accompanied Walter as far
                as Philadelphia, hoping to learn something definite in relation to the abode of
                Lucy, whose absence had become insupportable. Walter, however, was pledged to
                secrecy, so long as Lowe's secret remained un- explained. Such was Lucy's peremptory
                command. The young men rung at the door of the Winkle mansion and were instantly
                admitted by Rose. Being conducted into the parlor, they were immediately joined by
                Miss Wilsome dressed in her superb style, and in readiness for the enjoyment of the
                gayest societyy "Mr. Lowe!" cried she. "My dear friend, I am glad to see you. Why
                have you neglected me? Who is that?" she asked, pointing to Walter, who sat at the
                other end of the sofa. "It is"Walter, your nephew," said Lowe, wondering why Walter
                did not answer the question himself. "Walter? Oh, that disobedient boy! I don't know
                him. -J H e ' . <pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6922-00000133"/> 254 THE WINKLES. You may take your leave, sir," said she,
                addressing her nephew, " and remain away until I send for you." "I called merely to
                pay my duty, aunt, and take my leave, said Walter, rising. "I am, perhaps, onte very
                eve of leav- ing the United States, never to return." "Sit down, sir!" she cried, in
                a startling voice. "Ex- plain the meaning of your words. Why should you leave your
                country?" "My mother is poor- " "Nonsense! It is not so-it cannot be so, with the
                for- tune my brother inherited, and the handsome dowry possessed by herself. It is
                impossible. But what could you do abroad?" "If I go, it will be in the capacity of a
                diplomatic agent. I hope to obtain an appointment of that character from the
                President, and am now on my way to Washington with letters of introduction and
                recommendation." "Burn them, and go home 1 That is my advice. A Win- kle to stoop to

                Presidents, they can fill the subor- dinate posts. Will you burn your papers? "I
                cannot, aunt; I am pledged- "Very well. Farewell, then. I have heard it said you
                should have been bred to some useful pursuit-but I never supposed you could take up
                such a low trade as the politician's. You'll die a beggar. Mind that. Your uncle
                will have an heir to cut you off from the reversion-provided Gusset finds out her
                husband has but a life estate in the lands. She can manage it-the Lord knows how-I
                don't. But she would produce one. Your father squandered money and lost repu- tation
                in office. But he was elected by the people, not ap- pointed by any of your Irish
                Presidents. If he died poor, which I cannot believe, you may be sure he lost his
                fortune in politics." "Aunt," said Walter, "I have nothing to lose." "Nothing to
                lose? You are a Winkle! You have a name, and I suppose a character to lose. Go along
                about your foolish business! You may stay, however, till after dinner, WINKLE TAKES

                self." "I should be delighted,' said Lowe, rising, " to make one; but I have an
                engagement an hour hence, which I am bound in honor not to neglect. I came, Miss
                Wilsome, once more to entreat you to tell me, if you can, where I may find your
                niece " "My niece! Gone into politics, I suppose, or some other disreputable -"
                "Disreputable, madam!" "I mean taken up some disgraceful employment or other. Such
                as teaching music, or laboring in some way to make a living, when I am absolutely
                certain her father possessed an ample fortune. Oh, you needn't look so disconsolate,
                if you really love the girl. She is handsome enough, and I will an- swer with my
                life for her propriety of conduct." "You know not where she is?" , "I do not." "Then
                she is not in the city?" "No, I think not. Nor in New York, either, although she has
                an aunt there, too." "She has?" "Yes, she has. But she could never live with her."
                "Her name?" "Flora Blount-a fat creaturewho lives on novels, while a keen-eyed
                Scotch woman, her companion, a Miss McCrabbed, steals her money." "Lucy is there-I
                am sure!" said Lowe. "And I am sure she is not. Miss McCrabbed would not permit it.
                She would make the house- and a fine old man- sion it is-too uncomfortable-unless,
                indeed, Lucy had the art to quote some of Flora's favorite passages from the English
                novels, and make them apply to her case. But then, I don't think a Winkle would
                stoop to contend with a Scotch woman." "She is there," continued Lowe. If she is,
                she's safe. Therefore you can play with per- fect composure." Lowe thought
                differently, although he did not say so. He departed to keep his appointment,
                promising, however, to re- turn if he remained in the city. #* "Aunt," said Walter,
                rising, "I must go, too. Farewell." "I won't take your hand, if you are going to

                "Can you tell me any thing about Pollen, aunt? I have sought him in vain." "Yes; he
                left the city last week. He is in New York, and I hope he will fall in with your
                Aunt Blount." "She would have to feed on something more substantial than fashionable
                British novels to entertain him. But I am sorry his magazine was a failure. The
                first number-and it was the last-was really magnificent." "Of course it was. He has
                more genius than all the tribe of his persecutors combined. But it was his own fault
                he failed. He sent me the magazine, and I was pleased with it, and sent for him. He
                came; and what do you suppose he said to me?" "I cannot guess. He is different from
                other men." "He's a fool! He told me that Gusset, the stitching milliner, had loaned
                him the money to begin his publication! And he said he had no doubt she would loan
                him as much more as he wanted." "Then he was mistaken." "' Certainly he was! What
                better could he expect from her, a low-bred milliner I She patronizing a man of
                genius!" "She showed me his letter, a grateful acknowledg. ment " Grateful, indeed!
                I don't believe it. He is incapable of gratitude. All geniuses are forgetful of
                favors." "However, his thanks expressed in that way did not please her. She was
                disappointed with the magazine---" "How could she appreciate its merits? She knows
                no- thing of literature." "b But she could have read her own praises in poetry or
                prose, and there was nothing of'the sort in it." "Ha, ha, ha! Gusset wanting to be
                flattered in print! Fool as he is, Pollen has too much sense to be guilty of any
                such absurdity." "She therefore returned the magazine, and refused to loan him more
                money. She went further, and sent him a bill, and a dun for what she had already
                advanced." "The milliner A bill! A dun! Just like her! She knows how to receipt a
                bill for a bonnet. It is part of her1 trade. The idea of sending a bill to a poet!

                people! But I wish Pollen had shown me her letter. He was a fool for not doing so. I
                might have made his fortune. But I was in- censed. Printers, papermakers, and
                others, came to me to know if he was responsible, and all that. I had them turned
                out of doors without a word of reply. If I had known Gusset's conduct, I should have
                paid their bills; and I might have caused the magazine to be read and patronized in
                good circles. But the fool was inflexible. The enterprise failed, inevitably. Then a
                bill came to me for the price of the number I had received." "Is it possible? I did
                not think Pollen " I "Oh, necessity knows no law, they say, and the messenger said
                Pollen was in distress, and wanted the means of going to New York, where he had a
                prospect of obtaining employment as a sub-editor, or something of that sort." "Then
                I am sure you paid the bill." "I threw the bill in the fire, and'sent him a check
                for fifty dollars, with a message to leave the city as quick as / possible." ' That
                was noble in you, aunt." "It was different from Gusset's conduct. And now, since you
                are taking your final leave of me, for I shall have nothing more to do with you when
                lost in politics, here is a check that you may not starve in the streets. No
                thanks-not a word, or I will throw it in the fire! here! Away with you, fl now!"
                Walter thrust the check in ls pocket without read- F 'ing it, and hastened away.
                Lowe did not return to the Winkle mansion, and it is doubtful whether Miss Wilsome
                was able to make up the partners for her game that day. As for Lucy's lover, im-
                pressed with the belief that the one he sought, and from whom he could not endure a
                longer separation, was sojourning with her novel-reading aunt, he lost no time in
                taking passage for New York. At Babbleton, there was an occurrence, a few days after
                the departure of Walter, which must be noted in this true and faithful history.
                Roland, as if it might console him for his defeat and disappointment, had foreclosed
                the mortgage on Mrs. Winkle's property, and advertised it for sale. At every corner
                of the village, at the inns, on the fences, and on 9 <pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6922-00000135"/> 258 THE WINKLES.
                the trees, were printed handbills, announcing the sale of the widow's house and
                ground. And the wretch still had the impudence to visit the widow, and attempt to
                justify his conduct under the plea of necessity. He said he owed many debts, and
                could collect nothing except by process of law. Yet he never omitted to hint, that
                if Lucy would favor his addresses, the claim should be cancelled, and-he would
                either sell a portion of his own property to realize the sum he stood in need of, or
                else bring suit against other persons indebted to him. Mrs. Winkle, most
                unaccountably to Roland, far from deprecating his proceedings against her, besought
                him to spare the others. This incensed him very much, and it was with great
                difficulty he could suppress the malignity which consumed him, although it was his
                policy to avoid an irrecon- cilable rupture, as he still hoped that circumstances
                might yet throw Lucy within his grasp. Therefore at every inter- view with the
                widow, he sighed and groaned, and uttered pro- testations of his constant affection
                for her daughter, and lamentations that stern necessity compelled him to foreclose
                the mortgage. Virginia amused herself at the expense of her suitor, and would not
                deign to make a definite reply to his urgent en. treaties to be informed of his
                future fate. But he knew the spirit of the girl, and could build no expectation of
                success upon any of his own allurements, or stratagems, such as he a had employed
                for the Wstruction of Lucy and others. His only hope rested upon the influence of
                her father; but upon , that, as we have seen, he was likely to rely in vain. In
                seek- ing to consummate an advantageous alliance, Col. Oakdale was incapable of
                meditating a sacrifice of his daughter's hap- piness; of knowingly entertaining for
                a moment the preten- sions of a man wholly unworthy of being connected with his
                family. Honorable himself, he was likely to -be the last to attribute disreputable
                motives to another. On the day of sale there was a large crowd' assembled in front
                of the widow's premises. Roland stood at the sheriff's elbow, with a recently-formed
                intention to buy the property himself; and, as his tenants, he doubted not Lucy and
                her mother would evince a more tractable spirit than they had hitherto manifested.
                Bawsow the Scotch lawyer, was there to bid in the name THE SHERIFF'S SALE. 259 of
                Napoleon Winkle. This had been arranged by Griselda, who was, as she congratulated
                herself, to fall heir to all the real estate of her husband, when his mortal career
                should be ended. The lawyer was not authorized, however, to bid more than two or
                three thousand dollars, which Griselda thought would be quite as much as the
                property would bring at auction. She felt confident that Bawson's bid would be the
                highest, and that hencefoyh her old friend and protector, now fallen into the
                disgrace of poverty, would be her tenant. David Deal, the Quaker landlord, was
                there, prepared to purchase the property at half its value, if no one bid higher.
                Supposing the messuage would be sacrificed, and that he would be the purchaser, he
                had taken the precaution to prevent any odium that might be attached to such a
                purchase, by assuring his friends, if he should buy the property at a low figure, it
                would be because no one else would bid higher; and as a man could not bid against
                himself, and as the purchaser must always be the highest bidder, he ought never to
                be blamed for receiving double the value of his money, at a public sale. John Dowly
                stood with folded arms in the crowd assembled in front of the premises. He was a
                silent spectator, looking on with a sorrowful countenance. Many wondered what busi-
                ness he could have at the sale; and some uttered jests at his expense, and within
                his hearing. The widow sat in her parlor with a placid countenance. The window was
                hoisted, so that she could answer any inquiries respecting the conveniences of the
                establishment. The sheriff read aloud his authority to sell, and afterwards a
                particular description of the property. 'Then the house was put up for sale. Davy
                Deal bid $500. "Five hundred dollars!" cried the auctioneer; " just one eighth of
                the amount of the mortgage, and not one sixteenth of the value of the property!"
                "Thee knows I can't buy it if any one else bids more," said Davy. "One thousand
                dollars," said Mr. Arum. "Two thousand," said Mr. Crudle. "I'm done," said David;
                and he walked away. "Twenty-two hundred," said Bawson. "Twenty-five hundred," said
                Roland. "Twenty-five hundred-twenty-five hundred-two thou- sand five
                hundred-going-going--." <pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6922-00000136"/> 260 THE WINKLES. "Stop! stop! you -- infernal scoundrel!
                If you sell it before I get there, I'll blow your brains out!" This was uttered by
                Sergeant Blore, who approached as fast as possible, thumping the frozen ground at
                every step with his wooden leg. "Here," he continued, stumbling up to the sheriff,
                and placing in his hand an old handkerchief, in which were wrapped gold and silver
                coins, and rolls of city six per cent. bonds- Count them, I say; I bid that much."
                "You had better not interfere in this matter," said Roland. "' Not interfere? Isn't
                it a public sale? I bid that-IA don't know exactly how much-but if he takes another
                bid before he cries mine, I'll pistol him, if I hang for it the next hour. Not
                interfere! Mr. Roland! " "Well, sir-what do you want with me?" "You are a rascal,
                sir I That's all!" "What? What?"j "You heard me, and so did all the people. Ask
                them. You know where I can be found. I shall expect to hear from you. Sheriff, you
                can't count it on your arm. Put it down on the ground. I'll see in a minute how much
                my bid is." The old sergeant sat down, and spread open the handkerchief between his
                legs. Having placed a small pistol on one corner of the handkerchief, he proceeded
                to count the money. Before this was accomplished, and just when Roland had satisfied
                himself the sum was less than the amount of his own bid, old Dibble, Mrs. Winkle's
                gardener, came running from the bank with a hatfull of money-silver and gold, and
                small bills mingled-which he poured out beside the sergeant's treasure. "There,"
                said he " count that, too. Bid it all, sergeant. I'll stand by you. He is a rascal.
                Never fear." "Fear? I'm not afraid of the devil!" "Hit's a scandal hand a
                himposition for one's usband to squander hany thing bin that manner," said Mrs.
                Edwards, from an upper window of Lowe's house. "Let me get hat im," she continued,
                slamming down the window, and disap- pearing from view. "Take care of it, Dibble!"
                said the sergeant. "Don't let her touch a penny. Swear it's all your own.- I'm off!"
                And the poor old sergeant scampered away with a sort of hop- step-and-a-jump motion,
                and was soon out of view, followed by Mrs. Edwards, whom he distanced, however. THE
                WIDOW'S BID. 261 "Twenty-six hundred dollars " cried the sheriff, when Dibble
                completed the count. "Twenty-seven hundred," said Roland, whose face was still
                burning with the rage excited by the sergeant. "Four thousand," said the widow, from
                the window. "That's the amount of the mortgage," said the sheriff; "and if you have
                the money, and enough besides to pay the costs, &amp;c., I shan't take another bid."
                "She has no money," said Roland, in the sheriff's ear; "if so, she could have paid
                the debt. Don't take her bid." "I must. She may have the money. I rather think she
                has, he continued, espying a roll of bank notes partially ex- posed in the widow's
                hand. "You are mistaken. Else why did she permit the pro- perty to be advertised?"
                "She may have had reasons for it. I've known such things to take place. She may have
                wished to see who were her friends, or whether you really had the cruelty to sell
                her house over her head. It will tell against you at the next election, if you're a
                candidate." "Proceed," said Roland. "Discharge your duty. I suppose you can
                sympathize with any one after your com- missions are secured." "It's a free country,
                sir, and I can do as I please about this matter. It's the first time I ever cried
                off the home of the widow of a member of Congress, and I hope it may be the lat. But
                her bid shall have it, and if she has not got the money, I'll join with old Dibble
                and the sergeant and make it up. "Going-going- Gone. Too late, sir," he said, when
                Roland bid five hundred more. Mrs. Winkle was attracted by a stamping in the hall.
                "Who is it, Biddy?" she asked, when the girl entered. "Dill Bizzle." "Show him in.
                What's the matter, Bill?" she continued, seeing the frog-catcher panting with
                excitement. "I--I beg pardon, mam- but I hearn they wasgoing to sell you out of
                house and home, and so I went to the city ear- ly, and seed Miss Wilsome, mam." "Is
                it possible?" "Yes, main, and she'll be here in a minute. She told me to run on
                before and stop the sale till she come. Yonder she s, continued Bill, looking out of

                voice ;than usual. "Where's the monster? Oh, there you are, you vil. lain," she
                continued, approaching Roland, who, however, re. treated with all possible
                expedition. "The sale is over, madam," said the sheriff. "Over? Monstrous I Why
                didn't you wait till I ar- rived?" "I did not know you were coming." "Not know I was
                coming? Ridiculous! Who bought it " ' "The widow herself, madam-and she has placed
                the moo ney in my hands. It is in large bills, and is perfectly correct." "Then that
                idiot, Bill Dizzle, has led me a wild-goose chase. I broke up a whist party, and
                signed half a dozen checks for nothing." "Come in, sister," said the widow. "No! I
                wont 1 I've been made a fool of. True, the idiot said you didn't know he came to me.
                That's the reason I de- termined to come. Now I find there is nothing for me to
                do-and I had made up a party of four, and dummy was not needed. It was a wild-goose
                chase I'll go back in the down train. I hear the whistle," and turning away
                abruptly, she strode towards the depot. And it was observed that when she approached
                the crowd of passengers waiting on the platform, Roland, who had been standing among
                them, pulled down his hat and strode off in another direction. Before the crowd
                dispersed, three hearty cheers were giv- en for the widow, and as many groans for
                Roland. John Dowly was invited in, and constrained to stay to dinner. The sergeant
                made his appearance in the kitchen, having scaled the wall in the rear, being
                assisted by the Dib- bles, father and son. The widow quite as merry as ever she was
                in the height of prosperity, thanked her kind friends with tears in her eyes, but
                with a brave heart and smiling lips. Even poor Bill Dizzle, almost annihilated under
                the frown of Wilsome, was reassured by the grateful widow, who appreciated his gene-
                rous motive. *; . ' NEW YORK DURING THE -REVOLUTION. 263 CHAPTER XXIV. MSS FLORA
                BLOND'S MANSION IN NEW YORK-LUCY UNMASKS THE SCOTCH EDITH- THE MLNORS-THE BLUE
                CARRIAGE. THE mansion in New York, occupied and owned by Miss Flora Blount, was
                situated near the Battery, and was, half a century before, considered one of the
                most stately and desi- rable residences in the city. It had been the scene of many
                gorgeous displays during the Revolution, and when Washing- ton was shivering among
                the snows of the Highlands. Its halls and spacious chambers had resounded with
                British rev- elry, while the stifled groans of the suffering Americans, ex- posed to
                the inclemencies of a stormy winter, rose in effectual appeals to the great Arbiter
                of human affairs; and it was de- creed that Sir Harry Clinton should ultimately
                relinquish not only his comfortable quarters, but the city itself, and the en- tire
                country, to their proper owners. All this, however, had transpired years before the
                characters in this history were born. But the mansion itself had not changed. Since
                the death of Maj. Blount, and the school days of Edith and Flora, the house had not
                been repaired. There had been no paint be- stowed on the doors, the window shutters,
                or the iron railing in front. There it stood just as it had done in the old colo-
                nial days, a, specimen of British architecture, and of the olden- time ideas of
                comfort. Dust had accumulated on the sills, above the windows, and in every place it
                was possible to find a lodgment; and the spaces between the windows and the cor-
                nices were festooned with cobwebs, just as many of the old houses are in Parke
                street, London, and which are often occu- pied by the nobility. Within, however, the
                scene was different from the interior of the Grosvenor square residences. The-last
                occupant of the Blount mansion seemed to have made no effort, or did not possess the
                pecuniary ability, to vie in magnificence of furni- ture, with the proud dames of
                the 'fashionable west end of London. -Within and without the scene was the same.

                glass globule, containing the oil-fed lamp, was still sus- pended in the hall; in
                the parlors were retained the old high- backed chairs, the carving worn smooth, and
                the wood turned black with age, as was the case with all the furniture; and the
                carpets, once luxurious and beautiful, were now thread- bare, with their figures
                nearly obliterated. There were, how- ever, mirrors, and fine paintings, which had
                not deteriorated, except in the frames, from which the gilt had long since dis-
                appeared. The old fire-places remained as they were originally built, and no
                gas-pipes had invaded the premises. A pump was in the rear yard, from whose spout
                Andre, and Agnew, and Howe had quaffed theflowing water. The spirit of in; novation
                had passed harmlessly over the old Blount home- stead, nnd for some unexplained
                purpose, the last of the name was permitted to escape the predominant mania of the
                times. Like many other ladies, Miss Flora Blount, having survived the last decade'of
                half a century, had neither talent nor taste for business. But she had enjoyments,
                and so long as she might not be molested in the indulgence ofthem, she was quite
                willing the burden of the management of her pecuniary affairs should be borne by
                another. And in her case, the one which had been supplied by chance, was eminently
                adapted to the purpose, both of relieving her principal of the cares of provid- ing
                the ways and means in an economical establishment, and of providing for herself.
                This individual was the one already introduced to the reader-Miss Edith Mc'rabbed.
                She. had been recommended by one of Flora's literary acquaintances, when travelling
                abroad, and had been met with in Edinburgh. She was the niece of an old lady of
                decayed fortune, who was under the necessity of letting lodgings in a house she held
                on a long lease in Duke street, and with whom had sojourned oc- casionally, Sir
                Walter Scott, James Hogg, Jno. Wilson, and other worthies famous in the world of
                letters. Miss Edith. al- though fe had acted in the capacity of a sort of upper ser-
                vant to her aunt, had nevertheless enjoyed the acquaintance of the lodgers, and
                became familiar with many anecdotes relating to their professional pursuits, etc.
                And she had read their works, particularly those of Scott, and of the other writers
                of fic- tion, and could readily sympathize with Flora in her appreci- A CHANGE. 265
                ation of romantic characters. She was a treasure, such as Flo- ra had often sighed
                to possess; and Edith soon perceived that her lot had been cast with one exactly
                suited to her taste and purposes. By an almost imperceptible process, Edith obtained
                the ex- clusive direction of the affairs of her confiding employer, and finally
                managed them in such a manner that the least possible amount of the miseries of life
                should be endured by either of them, while the greatest possible sum of profit
                should be rea- lized for herself. One after another the servants had been dismissed,
                and Scotch substitutes were temporarily introduced to perform the indispensable
                duties periodically occurring. Last of all the cook had been dispensed with, and a
                contract entered into with a Scotch restaurateur to furnish the table. By degrees
                the guests entertained at Flora's board became diminished in number, she could not
                tell how or why; and finally they ceased altogether 'to enjoy her hospitality, such
                at least as involved any expense. Upon the first symptoms of dissatisfaction at such
                a result of the system of economy in- troduced by her friend-she never called her
                otherwise-Edith exhibited a statement of the income and expenditures of the
                establishment, and thus silenced all objections. And now the only guests that the
                circumstances of Flora permitted her to entertain at the social hearth, or
                otherwise, were the few surviving old maids or gay matrons who had been her
                contemporaries in girlhood, and still remembered the importance and high standing of
                the Blount family in former days. These ancient friends, themselves mostly
                aristocratic in their antecedents, and generally wealthy, from the increase in value
                of old estates remaining in their families, which appre- ciation their husbands,
                sons, or brothers, had the acuteness to perceive, and to avail themselves of, still
                called at the Blount mansion, and enjoyed the rhapsodies of Flora over the last
                British novel. They came in their own coaches, while the eco- nomical administration
                of Edith required their visits to be re- turned in omnibuses. The table was set in
                the breakfast room, before adiminu- tive fire feebly blazing on the hearth; at one
                corner ' which was seated Lucy Winkle, in an old leather-covered arm-chair; at the
                other Edith MoCrabbed, enveloped in a thick shawl, occupied a low stool. "I am
                shivering with the cold," said Lucy, putting down , <pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6922-00000139"/> 266 THE WINKLES.
                the paper she had been reading, and placing on the fire a small piece of wood. She
                then endeavored to assist its ignition by means of the bellows. "Pardon me, Miss
                Lucy," said Miss McCrabbed, " but I must warn you against any useless extravagance,
                if you would not see your aunt brought to absolute destitution. If that wood should

                She will be late this morning. You know it was midnight when she left the opera; and

                not finished until three o'clock this morning -for the affecting scenes had to be
                repeated three or four times--" "That was not contrary to her habit, Miss
                McCrabbed," said Lucy, puffing away with the bellows--" but I don't see why we
                should not be comfortable. I am sure my aunt would be grieved to think we had been
                suffering. There; it is burn. ing now." "; It would almost break her heart! Never, I
                beg of you, insinuate such a thing in her presence. You know how deli- cate her
                nerves are, and tender her sensibilities. It would be cruel to wound her susceptible
                feelings." "True, indeed. But still it seems to me that it would be cruel to
                ourselves to suffer from cold for the want of a little wood. The boy, McIlhenny,
                when he comes again, ought to fill the box." "You know I am willing to do any thing.

                the items; and particularly such items as some of them contain. I would not look at
                them, Miss Winkle. The cabinetmaker has put down so much for mend- ing an old piano
                leg, and repairing a sofa bottom; and his charges are outrageous-but must be paid."
                "But how much per quarter does my aunt receive for the store?" repeated Lucy, whose
                quick eye soon comprehended the rather startling sum total of the demands to be met
                at the end of the month, then on the eve of expiring. "Oh, it was rented by your
                aunt herself, before I left Scot- land, to the Messrs. Milnor &amp; Co.; you can ask
                her. I have, it is true collected the rent for many years, and. paid all the bills."
                "Then you know exactly the amount of her income and expenditures? '" ' How curious
                you are! If some of your aunt's acquaint- ances were to hear you, they wouldn't hint
                any more that poor Edith was laying plans to fall heir to Miss Flora's for- tune,
                such as it is." "My object, Miss McCrabbed, is to learn if my sojourn here is a
                burden that ought not to be imposed on my aunt." <pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6922-00000140"/> 268 THE WINKLES. "I am sure of
                it, if any extravagance is indulged. You must not be offended'at my plain speech,
                which means nothing. You may rely upon it, your kind aunt never knows what she can
                afford, or what she has to pay with, but from me. Be economical, as I am, and don't
                startle her by any allusions to her pecuniary affairs, and the expense of your
                living shall never enter her mind.' You may rely upon me for that." Lucy mused in
                silence, while pretending to resume the perusal of the paper, and Miss McCrabbed,
                turning away her face, enployed herself in separating the sticks of wood in such a
                manner as to prevent them from being too quickly consumed. Miss Flora Blount came
                down at length, holding a volume in her hand. There were traces of tears on her
                cheeks, evi- dences of the power of the gifted novelist. Miss Flora's age has been
                already hinted at sufficiently near. But, being fat, and somewhat rotund in outline,
                she bore her years very lightly, and still preserved a fulness of cheek, and
                smoothness of skin, not often possessed by others twenty years her junior. And her
                hair was still of a glossy blackness, which was sufficiently indicative of the fact
                that her sensitive nerves had not been often assailed by the miser. able shocks
                incident to age. Poor as her Scotch companion represented her, it was nevertheless
                quite evident that appre- hensions of future destitution and misery had not been
                per. mitted to prey too deeply upon her tender life. Inroads of that nature upon her
                spirits, might have caused an investiga- tion, and the adoption of a new system of
                finance. "My dear Lucy," said Flora, "why do you neglect your toast? Is not the
                coffee good?" "Excellent, dear aunt-it is always good. But, for some cause, and I am
                sure I cannot describe it, my appetite does not appear to be so voracious this
                morning as usual," "You alarm me! Edith, what do you suppose it is? You can always
                tell what ails me, and find a remedy. I wish you would learn the habits and wants of
                Lucy. She must not grow melancholy, or I shall be very unhappy." "She has been
                allowing her mind to dwell upon pecuniary matters, and dull affairs of business,"
                said Miss McCrabbed. "Oh, don't do that, my dear child--it will spoil your face. If
                I had undertaken to manage my own business; no doubt I should have been in the grave
                long ago. I owe my life to -.dith. Dr. McGab has told me so a hundred times. And .X

                years' notice, Edith, before you leave so that I may put my house in order, for I
                shall not survive your loss. Don't shed tears, dear Edith, or I shall be un- nerved.
                I am sure you won't desert me. But if Lucy would get you to think for her on the
                subject of her mother's affairs I am certain you would be able to devise a plan by
                which my poor sister might live in comfort on the little estate she has remaining."
                "I would do so with pleasure," said Miss McCrabbed, " if it were not that Miss Lucy
                has a brother. The men think our sex should not' meddle with matters of business.
                They deem us incapable of such duties. But-bless me, how loud somebody rings! Excuse
                me-it must be the postman." And she arose and went to the street door. "She was
                mistaken, aunt," said Lucy. "I was not dwell- ing upon my dear mother's affairs at
                all-but upon yours." "Mine? Oh, leave that to Edith. She understands every thing,
                and her' face is already spoiled by the cares of business." "But I am afraid my
                living with you will add too much to your expenses." "Not so! You will soon get
                accustomed to Edith's ways. She'll find the means of paying the bills. See what a
                number of them she has placed on the table for my inspection. The honest creature
                really supposes I may some time or other be disposed to examine them!" "I have been
                examining some of them, aunt; and I wish you would permit me to go and settle them
                for you." "Have you no aversion for such things, my dear Lucy?" "Not the least. I
                have been accustomed to paying my mother's bills, when Walter was absent." "If you
                could relieve poor Edith-for she has run herself down to a mere shadow--but then she
                would not consent to it. She don't mind trouble. If she had not dissuaded me from
                having Walter along with you, he might have attended to such things-but, really, she

                exact sum you derive from the rent of the store?" <pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6922-00000141"/> 270 THE WINKLES. "Not
                exactly-but Edith knows. I leased it for $2,000 per annum, miny years ago. The lease
                has been renewed every three years, Edith having my authority to let it. I have not
                seen Mr. Milnor for a great while, nor been in the store since it was altered, and
                the marble front added. I suppose the expense was taken out of the rent; but I don't
                know; and I have an utter aversion to bills and figures." "I have never known which
                store it was, aunt: and I should like to see it when I pass up the street. Do you
                know the number?" "I declare I don't remember. But you can find it by look. ing in
                the directory at the apothecaries'." "I will do so. I understand all these bills are
                due, aunt; and Edith told me they couldn't be paid until the next quar. ter's rent
                fell due. Suppose I try my hand at this business for you?" "If you have any taste
                for it, child, and will not let Edith know any thing about it, I am sure I can have
                no objection. You know Dr. McGab said you ought to walk at least two hours every
                day." "I think so, and I was always fond of walking. But I dislike going alone. Will
                you not go with me The doctor said you ought to walk to avoid a plethora with which
                you are threatened." "I am too indolent. I don't care what the doctor says. My
                health is nearly always good. But what is the matter with Edith Do you not hear her
                sobbing?" "I do, indeed." Edith entered the room with an open letter in her hand,
                and tears were streaming over her sallow cheeks. "I'm ruined!" said she; " all my
                savings and earnings for ten years are gone!" "Why, what do you mean? You frighten
                me, Edith!" said Miss Blount. "Oh, my dear Miss Flora, bear with me, and don't
                suffer your dear nerves to be unhinged. It is all my loss; you are fortunately no
                sufferer. Read it, Miss Blount-read the terrible letter.. But I beg you will be
                composed!" It was a letter from Mr. McCrabbed, her brother in Phila. delphia,
                informing her that the money remitted him had been placed in the hands .of a
                clergyman of their country for inl vestment, and had been lost by his failure. I
                "UCY'S ADVENTURES IN NEW YORK. 271 "Edith!" exclaimed Miss Blount, "you know I have
                a horror of figures. But I have never paid you any wages yet, as I intended to
                provide for you in my will, if you sur- vived me. How, on earth, then, could you
                have lost $3,000 by this dishonest countryman of yours, and a clergyman, too? I am
                sure you had no money when you left Scotland, for I re- mitted the funds to pay your
                passage. But never mind, poor thing-see how she weeps-any other time will do to
                explain. I hate such things. Go into your- room and become com- posed." Edith made
                her escape, her usually pale face glowing with rage-for, acute as she was, she had
                inadvertently made an exposure of her gains which had not been at all necessary.
                "Does it not seem to you, aunt, that there is something very extraordinary in this
                discovery?" "I confess it seems inexplicable, Lucy. But I have a great repugnance to
                such things. I am in a tremor now, and can hear the palpitations of my heart. I must
                lie down. You can go, Lucy, and have your walk. Edith will not think of the bills
                any more to-day; and if you could contrive to have them paid by the Milnors, I am
                sure it would save Edith a deal of trouble." Lucy soon after descended the dingy
                marble steps, and passing through the old iron gate which creaked on its hinges, and
                required all her strength to open, joined the ever-moving throng of pedestrians
                flowing into the great thoroughfare of the city. Wrapped in her furs, and radiant
                with health, the fine form and handsome face of Lucy could not fail to attract
                attention in any city; but in New York the curious glances were really oppressive.
                Nevertheless she was a brave girl, and had resolved to rescue her aunt from what she
                believed to be an iniquitous thraldom. Glancing over the bills in her hand as she
                walked along, she was struck with the fact that a majority of her aunt's creditors
                were Macs, and Cummingses, and Campbells; for it had never occurred to her before,
                that the foreigners who flourish in our country, when once they obtain a foothold,
                are extremely clannish; and proscribing the natives, bestow their patronage on their
                own countrymen. She called on several of the mechanics and tradespeople, and
                exhibiting their bills inquired if they did not seem a little exorbitant, remarking
                that she should obtain a list of <pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6922-00000142"/> 272 THE WINKLES. prices from others so as
                to enable her aunt to institute a comparison. In every instance there was an
                abatement of some twenty per cent., and she was informed that a similar reduction
                had always been made at the solicitation of Miss McOrabbed, although the bills were
                receipted in full as they were made out and presented. Promising to attend to the
                settlement of their demands, Lucy proceeded next to the apothecary's, to ascertain
                the- address of the Messrs. Milnor, her aunt's tenants. As she was entering the
                shop, she beheld Miss Bell Arum and Miss Susan Crudle standing near one of the
                counters, and luxu- riating in a draught of soda water; She did not speak to them.
                She did not know whether they could recognize her features through her veil, which
                was down; and she did not desire to renew her acquaintance with them unless quite
                cer. tain she hd been recognized. At all events, if they desired to hold any
                conversation with her, they should be the first to speak. While she was looking into
                the directory, the young ladies withdrew, but not without casting several glances in
                her direction. She felt rather relieved than annoyed that they had purposely avoided
                a recognition, or had not observed her particularly. But a moment after she was
                appalled at beholding Roland descending from a blue carriage near the apothecary's
                shop and he was waving a salute to the Misses Arum and Crudle, on the opposite side
                of the street. While his attention was attracted in that direction, Lucy hastily
                mingled with a party of ladies and gentlemen passing briskly along, and thus escaped
                his observation. The store occupied by the Messrs. Milnor &amp; Co. was found
                without difficulty. It was one of the most imposing business edifices in the street,
                and the firm of Milnor &amp; Co. was one of the most reputable in the country. The
                senior partner was a millionnaire, and had accumulated his gigantic fortune in that
                location. He was an importer, and one of the partners of the house constantly
                resided in Europe. It was the business of the establishment to fill the orders of
                lesser merchants, who again sold to the consumer. Lucy with difficulty pushed open
                the great glass door between the marble columns, and entered with a timid step, for
                she immediately perceived that it must be an unusual thing for ladies to enter an
                establishment where the merchan- SHE VISITS MR. MLNOR. 273 dise was only disposed of
                by the entire piece, or package, and where nothing was to be seen on the counters
                but samples and pattern cards. There were some ten or a dozen well- dressed young
                men standing about in various directions ex- hibiting samples to their customers;
                but no ladies were present. The appearance of Lucy attracting the attention of the
                young men, which it could not fail to do, there was some whispering, and a great
                many intelligent and curious glances exchanged between the salesmen. Soon one of
                them ap- proached, and with the utmost politeness and an ingenuous face, begged to
                be permitted to know the nature of the young lady's demand. "I desire to see Mr.
                Milnor," said Lucy. "My father is in the office, and I will conduct you to him with
                pleasure," said the young gentleman. Reassured by the announcement that the young
                gentle- man was the son of the principal of the firm, Lucy followed without
                hesitation, and they passed through another large glass door and entered a spacious
                office, handsomely carpeted, and containing sofas, mahogany chairs, and several fine
                paint- ings, and divers magnificent prints, by the best artists. "Father, here is a
                young lady who desires to speak with you on business," said Henry Milnor, and at the
                same time placing a chair for Lucy. After which he withdrew. The father was a tall
                handsome man, with beautiful silver. gray hair, an erect form, and a placid eye. He
                arose immedi- ately from the table where he had been writing, with a smile on his
                lip, and said he would be happy to receive the commands of the lady. ; I called,
                sir," said Lucy, " with a message from my aunt, Miss Flora Blount-- "Miss Flora
                Blount! And you are her niece I am very, very happy to see you," exclaimed Mr.
                Milnor, proffering his hand to Lucy, and in such a cordial, parental manner, it was
                impossible to think of refusing it. "Why, my dear Miss," he continued, sitting down
                in one of the luxuriously cushioned chairs, "you can hardly be aware of the delight
                I experience on meeting one of the family of that lady. Here have I been some twenty

                have never had the pleasure of beholding her, or any of her kindred, more than 12*

                punctual representa. tive, a business-like agent, as the Scotch people generally
                are; but I have repeatedly wished to meet with my landlady her. self, and could
                never venture to call at her dwelling." "I am sure my aunt will be rejoiced to hear
                of your pros- perity." "No doubt-everybody is. It is the universal practice. Would
                to heaven it were as common a thing to sympathize with the unfortunate! And perhaps
                your aunt would have done so. No doubt of it. But I should be happy to have known
                her more familiarly. She has an important estate in my custody, and I might impart
                information and advice in re- lation to it, of some value to her." "I have not the
                least doubt of it, sir," replied Lucy, "and I regret exceedingly that my aunt should
                have so great a re- pugnance for the details of matters so deeply involving her
                interest. - I am sure if she would avail herself of your coun- sels, there could
                hardly be any necessity for the adoption of so rigid a system of economy in her
                household-" "Rigid economy! and in her household!" exclaimed Mr. Milnor, in
                unaffected astonishment. "My dear Miss Blount---" "Miss Winkle, if you please, sir."
                "True-true-her sister married a Winkle, and you are her daughter. Then, my dear Miss
                Winkle, what you have just spoken fills me with amazement. Your aunt has no one to
                support but herself-she is certainly rich-and yet having to use economy! And with
                such a keen-sighted Scotch agent---" "That agent, sir--I may impart my suspicions to
                you in confidence." "Most assuredly." "Then during the few months I have dwelt with
                my aunt, I think I have ascertained that her agent, Miss McCrabbed, has acted
                improperly, very improperly, sir--" "Speak on, Miss Winkle-you need not hesitate to
                disclose any-thing of that nature to me." "I believe, sir, she has acted
                dishonestly, and defrauded my aunt." Lucy then described the mode of her aunt's
                living, the matter of the bills, and the contents of the letter MeCrab- bed had
                received from Philadelphia, and which had been so injudiciously exhibited.
                DISCLOSURES. 275 "She is a rogue-no doubt. But she understands business. No real
                estate agent in tho city could have managed this pro. perty better. I have expended
                ten thousand dollars on it, and still paid a heavy rent--" "Pardon me, sir-but may I
                inquire how much my aunt, or rather Miss McCrabbed, has been receiving from you?"
                "Six months ago the improvements and alterations were paid for, as per agreement,
                and the rent, according to the terms stipulated by Miss McCrabbed, remained, until
                that time, precisely what it was originally, $2,000. But since then, Miss Winkle, it
                has been materially increased, for it is a large lot, and in one of the best
                situations. In short, since the time specified, I am to pay for all repairs, for
                insurance, the taxes-- "The repairs, sir?" "Yes, it is so in the bond, and I was
                under the necessity of signing it." "The taxes too?" "Yes, truly. They ard paid. I
                have the receipt here, a month old." "Then my aunt has been most egregiously imposed

                receive $6,000, Miss Winkle; and I must say it is not an ex- travagant rent for a
                property which would sell for $100,000." "Is it possible? Then my poor aunt need not
                be dis- tressed-- " "Distressed She is rich! Tell her I say so And the lot she lives

                whose income might be some $10,000 per annum, fearing to be distressed!"
                "Unfortunately," said Lucy, smiling, " the ladies are not generally very skilful in
                the management of business. I mean the America ladies. But still, I fear it will be
                no easy mat. ter to convince my aunt of the culpability of Miss McCrab- bed, who has
                so long enjoyed her confidence." "And abused it," said Mr. Milnor. "Such proteges
                con- trive to make themselves agreeable, and often indispensable, and then pillage
                their benefactors without stint." <pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6922-00000144"/> 276 THE WINKLES.- "I fear, sir, my aunt has
                been a victim; but fortunately not to the extent she might have been if these
                developments had been postponed a few years longer. But really I had for. gotten my
                aunt's message. She desired to ascertain whether you would oblige her by
                anticipating the day of the next pay- ment-or rather advance her a sufficient sum to
                discharge these demands." "With twenty per cent. off, you know. Most assuredly! She
                shall have a check for $1,500 and-" "Oh, I beg pardon, sir! It has just flashed
                across my mind, that inasmuch as you have never seen me before--" "No, no, no! I
                know what you would say. I knew your mother. You have her face exactly, and a most
                beautiful-I beg your pardon! But you are taller than she was--" "Still, Mr. Milnor,
                you must permit me to have my own way in this matter. I have reasons for it. And I
                assure you it would be a great favor if yon would bring the checks your. self to my
                aunt's house, and take her receipt. And you may perhaps be disposed to substantiate
                what I mean to tell her in relation to the conduct of Miss McCrabbed." "Then leave
                the bills with me, Miss Winkle. I will first cause them to be paid. My son shall
                attend to it himself- and-perhaps, if my engagements prevent me from going to. your
                aunt's house, Henry might answer the purpose?" "If he knew the circumstances-- " He
                shall know them, and also my opinion in the case. Your aunt will find him an
                intelligent boy-although he has resided abroad half of his life. Henry!" he
                continued, opening the figured glass door, and admitting his son--" this is Miss
                Winkle, the niece of Miss Flora Blount. You will conduct her to your mother's
                carriage, if it is still standing on the opposite side of the street, and order the
                coachman to drive to her aunt's house--that is if it be her purpose to re- turn
                directly home-and if not, direct him to go whitherspev- er she pleases." "By no
                means! But I thank you!" said Lucy, smiling, and slightly blushing, as the tall
                handsome figure of the young man bowed before her. "I shall prefer to walk. In the
                village where my mother dwells, I have been accustomed to much walking, and my
                physician says it is necessary." The young man, however, conducted her with
                deferential politeness into the street, assuring her repeatedly that his A DISHONEST

                she was sitting to an artist in the opposite build- ing. Lucy, however, did not
                yield to his entreaties, but sig- nified her gratitude for his kind attentions.
                Again, when arrived in view of her aunt's dwelling the ha- ted blue carriage of
                Roland met her view. It was just start- ing away from in front of her aunt's door,
                and she did not doubt now, that Miss McCrabbed was capable of plotting with her
                persecutor against her peace. The blue carriage had been seen in front of the house
                almost every day; and Miss Mc- Crabbed had in all probability informed Roland of her
                place of abode. She had certainly mentioned his name more than once in her presence,
                and in terms of praise, which she recol- lected with a painful distinctness. She was
                now somewhat relieved on seeing the carriage move off in aff opposite direc- tion,
                so that she did not have to meet it when approaching the dwelling. The door was
                opened by Miss McCrabbed, who suddenly seized Lucy's arm, when it closed. "Give me
                the bills!" cried she. "Why did you take them? Did I not say you must never meddle
                with my busi- ness? You shall leave here, or I will! And we'll see who your aunt
                will be the most willing to part with!" "I have not got the bills. But they are paid
                by this time. Release my arm!" "I will not! The bills-who is to pay them " "No
                matter. Release my arm!" "I will not." "You shall!" said Lucy, burning with
                indignation, and hurling the slight form of the enraged woman away from her. Lucy
                was young and strong, and McCrabbed was thrown in contact with the wall, and
                slightly stunned by the collision.' "Wretch! cried she, recovering, "I'll be
                revenged " "Dishonest woman!" said Lucy, "your frauds have been discovered! The
                money remitted your brother did not be- long to you. There will be a gentleman here
                presently to en- lighten my aunt in regard to your sordid practices. Justice at last
                must always overtake the transgressor." Without pausing to mark the effect of her
                words, Lucy hastened into the parlor, where she found her aunt re-peru- sing certain
                chapters of the"Children of the Abbey," perhaps for the fiftieth time. <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6922-00000145"/>
                ASTOUNDING REVELATIONS.279 279 "Lucy!" said Miss, Flora,\ with a deep sigh, " do you
                think there really ever existed such a wretch as the Marquis of Rosline's
                housekeeper " "Indeed I do, my dear aunt; there are many such who would appropriate
                to themselves the money intrusted with them for the benefit of others, and who would
                not hesitate to introduce such villains as Belgrave--" "Oh, horrible!" Dear aunt, my
                persecutor, Roland, has found out my place of abode; and I am sure it must have been
                by means of treachery. The blue carriage, which has been so often no- ticed by us,
                belongs to him." "Is it possible? Why I saw the coachman speaking to Edith a little
                while ago I How did she know any thing about Roland?" a "It is impossible for me to
                say. But you know she has frequently mentioned his great wealth, and his honestlove,
                &amp;c." "True. What could have been her meaning?" "She is one of the Rosline
                housekeepers.", "Lucy! Surely you do not think so!" "I surely do. Listen to me,
                aunt." She then detailed all she knew in relation to the speculations of McCrabbed.
                "Listen to my heart beating I Oh, my dear Lucy, what shall I do! You will not desert
                me, will you?" "Certainly not, if you dismiss McCrabbed." "She shan't stay an hour,
                if she has been guilty of these things, even if it breaks my heart I But how shall I
                manage without her!" "I will undertake to see that nothing shall be wanting," said
                Lucy. "Mr. Milnor will send one or two of his servants until you can procure proper
                ones of your own. Remember you are rich, aunt, rich." ' True, I had forgotten it.
                Why, Lucy, I shall be able "to keep a coach of my own!" "To be sure youwill. I
                hearthe bell-it is Mr. Milnor, no doubt. Again! Whydon'tEdithopenthe door?
                Iwilldoit." When Lucy threw open the door, she was startled by the appearance of Mr.
                Henry Milnor,. when she had been expect- ing his father. Without delay, however, she
                conducted him into the parlor, and introduced him to her aunt. He deliver ed the
                bills he had paid, and showed where twenty per cent of the amount had been deducted.
                And he confirmed what Lucy had said in regard to the misrepresentations of Miss
                McCrabbed. The taxes and repairs he assured Miss Blount were to be paid, and really
                had already been paid by. his father and besides, he was to make her the quarterly
                payment of fifteen hundred dollars. That sum he was now prepared to place in her
                hands, the amount of the bills he had just dis- charged deducted. "Edith never
                informed me of this!" said Miss Flora. And is it possible I have been so egregiously
                deceived by one in whom I placed such unlimited confidence?" Mr. Henry Milnor said
                he had no doubt of it, and Lucy repeated her convictions of the treachery and
                ingratitude of the Scotch minion. Mr. Milnor, before departing, informed Miss Flora,
                that his father had authorized him to say, he would be happy to become the purchaser
                of the property in Broadway, at the price named to her niece. "And what was that,
                Lucy " asked Miss Blount. "I believe it was $100,000." "That was the amount," said
                young Milnor. "Can it be possible?" cried Miss Blount. Why, it was valued at just
                $20,000 when it came into my possession; and this house and lot at $10,000." ;My
                father," continued young Milnor, "Isays this property would sell for $50,000."
                "Really, I never supposed such prices could be obtained. But this is the old family
                mansion, and I could never think of selling it. The other was purchased by my father
                of some one who owed him, and was never occupied by any of the family. But I never
                sold any thing in my life. I wonder what Edith--- " "Edith, aunt!" "I forgot,
                child'! Edith is fallen. But what would yoz advise, Lucy?" "I think I would not sell
                it, aunt, since it brings you an amiple income." "My niece would not like to sell
                it, sir, and I have no doubt her notion is a very correct one." Mr. Milnor rose to
                depart. But before taking his leave, said he had been charged by his father to make
                a tender of his services, andto beg that Miss Blount, or any member of er family,
                would never hesitate to apply to him for counsel, * 278 THE WINKLES. <pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6922-00000146"/>

                friend. And, while bowing gracefully, the young gentleman added his own
                solicitations to those of his father, remarking that it would make him happy to be
                enabled to render any species of service. He was thanked very earnestly by both the
                ladies, and charged with kind acknowledgments to his father, of whom, Lucy remarked,
                she had determined to ask a favor -that day, if it had been convenient for him to
                appear in person. The young gentleman lingering on the threshold, as if bound by an
                irresistible fascination, assured her he would use his utmost endeavors to
                accomplish whatever might have been requested of his father. After some hesitation
                and blushing, Lucy mentioned her aunt's destitution of servants; and in- timated
                that inasmuch as Miss McCrabbed had been detected in one moral delinquency, she was
                fearful it might not be safe to trust her any farther. In short, her aunt and
                herself might not be able to partake of any food of Edith's preparing or procuring,
                with the confidence necessary to their ease and, perhaps, their health. She had
                intended, therefore, to ask the favor of him to permit one of his servants to stay
                at her aunt's dwelling, until she could procure one or more of her own. The young
                man bowed again, and assured Lucy there would be no difficulty in obtaining his
                mother's assent to the ar- rangement; and he asked and obtained permission to call
                again that very evening. After the departure of Mr. Henry Milnor, Miss Flora Blount,
                bracing her nerves for a stormy interview with Miss McCrabbed, proceeded to the
                usual sitting-room, where the greater portion of her housekeeper's time was spent,
                accompa- nied by Lucy, who, impressed with the belief that Roland had received
                intelligence from the treacherous Edith, resolved to encourage and support her aunt
                in the trying scene which she supposed was about to be enacted. But no McCrabbed was
                there; nor was she to be found in any part of the house, and every room in it was
                searched inrain. Undoubtedly she had fled, under the supposition that her offen- ces
                might subject her to the pains and penalties of the law, and not knowing the
                difference between the practice of our government and that of Great Britain. The
                idea of transpor- tation filled her with terror. And so, after overhearing the con-
                versation in the parlor, she had noiselessly brought down her THE HOUSEKEEPER'S
                ESCAPE. 281 trunk, and summoning her boy McIlhenny, who preceded her to the depot,
                set off for Philadelphia to join herbrother, and seek an asylum under his
                protection. , a CHAPTER XXV. THE BLUE CARRIAGE-LETTERS FROM BABBLETON AND PRILADEL.
                PHA.. MRS. LAUREL'S VISIT. IN a few weeks Miss Flora Blount's mansion assumed a new
                appearance, without and within. The painter and paper- hanger had been employed; a
                furnace diffused its warmth ,....ghot the loue throughout the house, and gas
                illuminated the halls and par ors. Two excellent servants, which had been
                recommended the Milnors, were substituted for the false Edith, and Miss Flora
                readily expressed her opinion that the new system was less shocking to her nerves
                than the old. Bnt Lucy's nerves became more and more affected as she daily beheld
                Roland's blue carriage standing within a con- venient distance of the door, as if in
                waiting for her. Her aunt was disposed to regard the circumstance as a romantic
                incident, and really believed the man was mad in love, and could not restrain
                himself from pursuing her niece. But as she watched the carriage from behind her
                curtains, she won- dered why Roland himself was not visible as often as his
                coachman. More than half the time the Vehicle was entirely empty. What a mystery!
                But the mysteries of bad men " are mostly fraughtwith evil. For more than a week
                after Lowe had discovered the place of Luc's abode, he had been restrained from
                seeking an in- terview by the ominous presence of that carriage. Lucy, her- self
                unseen, had observed him passing with his eyes adl fixed upon Roland's equipage!s
                Finally his passion had overleaped all restraints, and he had sought and obtained an
                interview with the object of his affection But unfortunately neither of them ad
                referred to the subject of the blue carriage. Lucy had forgotten such an annoyance
                in the presence of Lowe; and Lowe, fthough it was never absent from his mind, could
                not find -sufficient resolu- <pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6922-00000147"/> 282 THE WINKLES. tion to demand an
                explanation. But his face was pale. and his voice often tremulous, as if his heart
                were a prey to some hidden anguish which he durst not disclose. Lucy, attributing
                his melancholy to quite a different cause from the true one-seeing the badge of
                mourning on his hat- in vain expended her sympathy, and sought by her conversa: tion
                and manner to manifest her concern. His sadness could not be dispelled, nor the
                rising tear always repressed. And yet scarcely a day was now suffered to pass,
                during which he did not spend more or less of his time at the old mansion; but it
                was generally in the company of other visitors, for a great change had taken place
                in the social habits of the in- mates of the house, and there was scarcely an hour
                that some one did not call. The famous Mrs. Laurel, after a lapse of twenty years,
                had renewed her intimacy with Miss Blount. Mrs. Laurel had then her sixth husband,
                and was enormously rich. Originally her position in society was good, and she was a
                schoolmate of the Blounts. But her father becoming bankrupt, she mar- ried one of
                the clerks in his office, and ran off to New Qrles, where an epidemic soon made her
                a widow, at th age of seventeen. Being still poor, she accepted the hand of a
                planter of middle age, who was killed the next week in a duel, but not before
                bestowing his fortune on her. She was now rich, and had learned the value of riches;
                and as she married in succession three other wealthy husbands in the South, all of
                whom in the course of twenty years were peacefully slumbering in the oblivious
                grave, while the favored widow, although past the flush of youth, still retained
                much of her original beauty, she returned to New York, and became the wife of Mr.
                Laurel, an eminent bibliomaniac, a famous traveller, a mil- lionnaire, and the
                entertainer of distinguished foreigners. Therefore Mrs. Laurel was famous. But she
                had peculiari- ties of her own which would have made her distinguished aside from
                the celebrity of her husband. And one of these was. her incessant talking-others in
                her company rarely being able to utter more than simple monosyllables. And it was
                remarkable that the subject of her interminable speeches was generally the
                difficulty she had in the management of her servants. Almost every time she "rode
                out" she was in quest of a cook, or chambermaid, or waiter. She had been so long
                accustomed to slaves in the South, that it seemed she THE VISITORS. 283 could never
                become habituated to the habits of northern domestics' And it was- upon one of those
                voyages of disco- very that she had accidentally met with Miss Blount, and renewed
                the acquaintance, and subsequently, after inquiries, and finding her old schoolmate
                possessed sufficient fortune, she resolved to re-establish the terms of intimacy
                which had in early times subsisted between the families. She was like- wise
                powerfully stimulated to this end from a desire to ex- hibit the surpassing beauty
                of Lucy at her magnificent mansion. The Milnors, too, were frequent visitors to Miss
                Blount and her niece, and an intercourse of the most agreeable cha- racter sprang
                from the accidental visit of Lucy to the store in Broadway. But this, however, was
                not unattended with misgivings on the part of Lucy, who soon began to apprehend that
                Henry Milnor, from his assiduous attentions, might seek to make a tender impression
                on her heart, which she- deemed to be already sufficiently impressed by the image of
                another. Pollen, too, had more than once called upon Lucy and her aunt, at the
                request of Walter, with wlhom he corre sponded. The poet again possessed a shirt of
                his own, and otherwise exhibited a genteelexterior. He was in the employr of a
                brother poet, more favored by fortune, and earned a sub- sistence in the capacity of
                a regular contributor to the columns of a literary periodical. Nevertheless whether
                in indigence or prosperity, Pollen seemed destined to be always the pro- tegee of
                some lady of more mature years than himself; and now, of all the gentlemen that
                formed the agreeable society at the Blount Mansion, none enjoyed so large a share of

                There was an irresistible attraction in his writings, imparted by his extraordinary
                genius, which, in Flora's opinion, made amends for his singular eccentricities. She
                admired his works, and thence her sympathy extended to the author and the man.- It
                is strange that women should have a desire to possess that which is avowedly
                unattainable. The declaration of a poet that his heart has been long buried in the
                grave of some beautiful being , exclusively worshipped aned for ever lost, have
                never yet discouraged 'others of the sex, who have survived, from meditating their
                capture. Such being the result of Lucy's observation, it was not with- out some

                acute vision it was apparent that Pollen had never earnestly conceived the idea of
                again enter. ing into the bonds of wedlock, and above all for the mere purpose of
                obtaining a home and an independence which could not otherwise be realized. Walter
                had informed her of his conduct towards her aunt in Philadelphia, as well as of his
                rupture with Griselda; and as there was no reason to sup. pose her Aunt Flora's
                happiness might be sacrificed by any caprice of the poet, the growing intimacy did
                not give rise to any very serious apprehensions. One afternoon when Lucy was sitting
                with her aunt in the room recently converted into a library, and in which were

                parts of the house, the postman sent in two letters, one for the aunt, and the other
                for the niece. "Here is news from Babbleton," said Lucy, and narrated in my dear
                mother's merry vein. Listen, aunt:-"Griselda still keeps my poor brother a close
                prisoner, while she dashes about in her coach and four. But she has cut all her poor
                acquaintances, and of course I am blotted out of her books. She passes without
                calling, and without knowing how heartily I laugh at the ridiculous figure she
                makes. But she patron- ized our minister, Mr. Amble, and that is a charitable expen-

                when stumping on his way to see me, was seized by Mrs. Edwards. She demanded his
                money-and-he cried murder! He tripped her up with his wooden leg and made his
                escape. But it seems he sprained her ankle, and she has since threatened to bring "

                perpetrate such an annoyance. Some of her finery must have cost a great deal of
                money, and no one ever supposed Lowe pos- sessed a superabundance of it. By the way,
                I forgot to mention that Bell Arum has written home a precious budget of news, which
                her, mother, as usual, has published to all her acquaintances. She says she saw you
                examining the register, and that you were in the habit of wandering about alone and
                unprotected. She says Mr. Lowe is likewise in the city; and if her ma would put that
                and that together, she would know as much as the writer, no doubt! And she says they
                have an invitation to the aristocratic Mrs. Laurel's parties, and that some of the

                himself to death in New York to earn a scanty living, which he might have had for
                nothing by remaining here and behaving himself. He is a fool-just like other poets
                who have genius, and therefore he ought not to be permitted to kill himself.
                Enclosed I send a check for a trifling sum payable to bearer, which, perhaps, with
                delicate management you may induce him to make use of for his own benefit. Perhaps
                he needs some new shirts. I have seen him twice without any-and I believe he has one
                of Walter's yet. Speaking of checks and of Walter, I gave my cast-off nephew one
                when he was on his way to that Babylo- nian rendezvous of demagogues, which, for
                some reason--or rather for the want of reason-he did not use. I suppose he gave it
                to some fool or other poorer than himself. But the cashier of the bank did not pay
                the money. There needed Walter's name on it, he said, written with his own hand. as

                twenty streets, until I can find a character---- "Character, Mrs. Laurel?"asked
                Lucy. "Yes, character, my pretty child. A character for my new chamber maid. The

                her. The range is not to her liking, and the pots are too thick and heavy. I am
                aggravated almost to death, by my servants. I pay them about double wages, and it
                only seems to make them worse. How do you manage yours, Flora?" "Me? Oh, I never
                meddle with them." "And they stay and perform their duty?" "I believe so said Flora.
                "They behave very well," said Lucy. "You are the most lucky person in the world, and
                I am the most unfortunate. I called just to say you must not for the world stay away
                from my first night. It will be a grand affair. The Countess and the young Earl will
                be there. . Mr. Laurel knew the old Earl, and often dined at his house in town,
                Harley street, Cavendish square, and hence he is an old acquaintance of the
                Countesses." "What Countess and Earl?" asked Flora. "Haven't you heard? It's all in
                the papers. The most ro. mantic thing in the world. The old Earl of Hilton was
                killed in Napoleon's wars, and left two sons. The eldest, and theone who succeeded
                him, was dissipated, wild, and trifling. The younger was just the reverse in every
                thing, and therefore he was despised by the new lord. Hunting together one day, the
                Earl's horse took fright and threw him. He was stunned and insensible a long time,
                but his brother succeededinbearing hiin to the castle, where he was surrounded by
                his vile crew, who charged the young man .with having contrived some plan to

                earl hiniself as Induced to express the same opinion, and the younger brother,

                taking leave of his mother, from whom he had a moderate income, his elder brother
                never having granted him any thing, he came to this country." "To this country? ,
                repeated Flora. "Yes, to the United States. That was several years ago. Most of his
                time has been spent on the plains, for he was ex- ceedingly fond of wild adventure.
                But he assumed another name-I am so forgetful I can't recollect it-but no matter.
                Well, his brother was killed by his horse at last in some sort of a break-neck
                race--I don't remember what they call it-- but it can hardly be desirable sport. So
                the younger brother is now the Earl of Hilton, and the countess, his mother, is to

                sought for the paper containing the story of the incognito nobleman, and found it to

                had written it for the journal. Presently another visitor was announced, and shown
                into the parlor. This was Mr. Quince McCrabbed, the brother of Edith. "Mercy on me!"
                exclaimed Flora; "he's come to talk about Edith-perhaps with a message and

                brother?" "My nerves are made of wire, as Mr. Lowe says," replied Lucy. "But Mr.
                Milnor had anticipated something of the sort, and furnished me with matter for a
                threatening speech, which soon put him to flight." <pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6922-00000152"/> 292 THE WINKLES. CHAPTER XXVI.

                PROPOSES. AT the hour appointed, quite a fine hired carriage was at the door of the
                Blount mansion. This was Lucy's suggestion; for she did not think her aunt quite
                rich enough to keep an equipage of her own, and she did not suppose such an estab-
                lishment was necessary to maintain a good position in society. They were born in a
                good circle, and hence they belonged to the "privileged class," as it was termed by
                the envious parve- nues. But they had a front seat at the opera; which, how- ever,
                was more for their own enjoyment, than for the purpose of making a display.
                Nevertheless, they did make an unrivalled display. Most beautiful at all times, Lucy
                was perfectly enchanting in the full glare of the chandeliers. A thousand eyes
                rested on her, and inquiries in regard to the "perfect angel," were whispered in all
                parts of the house. Mr. Pollen occupied a seat between Lucy and her aunt; and, being
                in the vein, entertained them with judicious criti. cisms on the comparative merits
                of the performers. "That pale girl," said he, "in the chorus, has a finer voice than
                the prima donna. Listen! But she is an American, and is paid but five dollars a
                week. If they had her in Paris a couple of years, by changing her name so as to make
                it ter- minate with an i, she might earn $500 a night; and that, too, in her own
                country, provided the place of her nativity were kept a profound secret." "Mr.
                Pollen, do you not hate your own country?" asked Lucy. "I hate its errors and
                blemishes." "But is it not the same, and has it not always been the same, with other
                countries? You know a prophet is not with- out honor, except in his own country."
                "True; but should we not profit by the errors of other nations? The people of our
                great country should despise the servile practices of European nations."
                "Nevertheless," continued Lucy, "we sometimes have our revenge." THE OPERA. 293
                "Yes!" said Miss Blount, having recovered from a paroxysm of ecstasy, into which she
                had been thrown by the finale of the first act; "for the London Times, brought by
                the steamer to-day, is filled with praises of an American actress-a Miss Delia
                Glass." "I saw the eulogiums," said Pollen. ":Her fortune is made. And if you had
                looked among the advertisements, you would have seen a bookseller's announcement of
                an illustrated edition of my works. What publisher here would have un- dertaken such
                an enterprise? None, not one. I have tried them all. But I shall not derive a
                particle of pecuniary ad- i vantage from the publication-not one cent. It is a
                retalia- tory measure. Our members of Congress, better capable of appreciating the
                value of dollars, and the votes of paper. makers and bookbinders, than the brains of
                authors, have re- fused to foster a national literature; and in consequence the
                country is inundated with republications of European books, whose authors can derive
                no compensation from our pub. lishers." "But, being indorsed by the British
                critics," said Lucy, "your countrymen will now recognize your pretensions, and
                acknowledge your merit." I "Oh, yes, in time. And they will ultimately purchase my
                works. But then I will be in my grave. Too late! too late! Excuse me." The poet
                hastily withdrew, quivering with an excessive agitation. "He'll be back soon," said
                Miss Blount. "But, my dear Lucy, I hope you will in future avoid that subject. It
                always produces an uncontrollable excitement. The poor poet has been the victim of
                the critics." "I will remember, aunt. I wonder what can be the reason Mr. Lowe has
                never looked in this direction?" continued Lucy, observing that her aunt was
                regarding the young gen- tleman, who stood near the orchestra. "I cannot
                conjecture," said Flora. "I have been striving for some time to catch his eye, but
                in vain. And yet he is constantly casting his glances above us. Who can he see
                there?" The aunt and niece turned involuntarily, and beheld the face of Roland
                behind them. He was standing near the door, in the next box to them. He bowed to
                Lucy, but she did not return it. Lowe, who had seen only the motion of Rolandc <pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6922-00000153"/>
                294 THE WINKLES. turned his eyes away, and gazed at the Misses Arum and Crudle, in
                an opposite box. Lucy was pained at the occurrence, and turned her face aside in
                sadness. "Who is that man?" asked Miss Blount. Roland," was the faint reply. "So it
                is! I should have known him, as often as I have seen him recently in the blue
                carriage. But he is more hand- somely dressed than usual, and is quite a
                fine-looking man for one of his age. Well, well, he's gone. Cheer up, my child.
                There is no danger here. Can you tell me who are those impudently bejewelled girls
                over yonder, with their glasses continually pointed at us?" "Oh, yes," said Lucy,
                recovering from her dejection. "They are the belles of Babbleton. The
                representatives of all the Arums and Crudles-rich and- " "Fools! as your Aunt
                Wilsome would say. I do believe they are talking scandal about us, and to all the
                eager young gentlemen fluttering around them. Did you ever see such airs-such
                affectation?" "I suppose they have been saying, they disliked the idea of attending
                Mrs. Laurel's parties, if we are to be there." "No doubt they will tell
                everybody-for everybody seems to have access to them-that Mrs. Laurel has sent them
                notes of invitation. But here comes my poet, radiant with smiles." This was true.
                Pollen resumed his seat in high spirits, and announced that he had just met a
                bookseller in the lobby, who made him a flattering proposition. Lucy intimated that
                the British appreciation of his merit had probably incited the bookseller to make
                the offer; and the poet did not doubt the truth of her conjecture. At the end of the
                next act, Pollen, in the exuberance of his gay humor, poured an incessant volley of
                words into the ear of Miss Blount, and of course he had an attentive listener. And
                Lucy, apparently neglected, and looking in vain for the one who had monopolized her
                thoughts, was conscious of a slight movement behind, and the next moment was
                surprised by the voice of Lowe, who calmly took possession of an unoc- cupied seat
                on her left. In vain she strove to arrest the scarlet flood which rushed into her
                cheeks, and spread over her temples and forehead. EXPLANATIONS. 295 "I saw Roland
                bow to you to-night," said Lowe, in a half whisper. "He did," was the reply. "You
                could not forbid it; you could not prevent him----" "No, no, I could not. I turned
                away from his gaze as quickly as I could. But why do you still mention his name?
                After the occurrence on the night of my uncle's-you know perfectly well what I
                allude to-it would be doing me great injustice to suppose I could pardon his
                conduct, or admit him again, voluntarily, into my presence." He must be the most
                mendacious man that ever existed I Do you know he has reported at one of the clubs
                he attends, that you have obtained his permission to use his carriage as your own?"
                "No; I did not know he had slandered me thus. His carriage! Oh, Mr. Lowe, I have
                desired to mention the sub- ject of his carriage to you, but could never have the
                resolution to say what I so anxiously wished. And this is not the place. Will you
                not accompany us home after the opera?" I cannot. I am sorry I am otherwise engaged.
                I came with a lady, now in one of the private boxes -" "I will not ask who she is,"
                said Lucy, " nor seek to know if she gazes at you, or watches your steps, or -" "Oh,
                Lucy, do not attempt a retaliation. My heart is only for you. You may break it-- "
                "I break it!" "You may crush it, and then it can never be offered to another.
                Henceforth, it can be of no value to any one." "Why will you distress me thus? Oh,
                Edmund! if you but knew the misery you inflict by such unjust suspicions; if you
                would but hear me, and believe my words, which are true-and would be equally as
                frank and confiding-- " "To-morrow I will see you. And-and soon-very soon, there
                will be an end to my mystery, which has been only a source of unhappiness-an
                inevitable- but the curtain rises, and I must hasten back to my companion-who, by
                the way, Lucy, is quite as old as your mother. Adieu." After Lowe left her, Lucy,
                instead of beholding Roland, had the pleasure to see Henry Milnor approach, and
                occupy the seat at her elbow. He remained until the bell rang for the final act; and
                he sought by every means in his power to dispel the slight cloud of gloom which he
                thought might be <pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6922-00000154"/> 296 TH. WINKLES. discerned on the fair brow of Lucy. And it
                was measurably dispersed by his fascinating powers of conversation. He pointed out
                the lions and the most distinguished belles of the city to her, and related many
                innocent anecdotes of them, which interested his fair listener. "But I have not the
                happiness to be acquainted with all the belles of Babbleton," said he, directing her
                attention to- wards the opposite box, where Bell Arum and Susan Crudle were
                apparently straining their eyes to catch every attitude and motion of the occupants
                of the box in which he was sitting. "I supposed," said Lucy, "by this time the
                ladies opposite would have been known by all the gentlemen--I mean the fashionable
                gentlemen." "And why, pray . " "Because they are reputed to be rich. But you are not
                a fashionable gentleman. You told me so yourself Their- names, then--" "Oh, I know
                their names," said Milnor. "That was all I meant," continued Lucy. "I could not
                suppose all the gentlemen had cultivated their acquaintance. Such an attempt would
                not allow the poor belles sufficient time to take their food." "And they would
                incontinently perish." "That is malicious. But they have been telling tales, as Mr.
                Lowe informs me. He says they have given the history of my family to their eager
                auditors. Do you know any of the delighted young gentlemen who seem to be their
                worship- pers." "I know the names and occupations of several of them- and I think it
                probable they have mentioned my name, if the young ladies are at all inquisitive."
                "Inquisitive! Let your shafts fall exclusively on the ruder sex." "Very well. One of
                their admirers is a hair dyer--- A what?." ( He certainly keeps a little shop, in

                I don't think he will marry a fortune, from the fact that-his rivals have the knack
                of saying more smart things than him- self. I suppose the full-chested beau, with
                his thumbs in his vest holes, and whose voice can sometimes be distinguished at this
                distance, and whose laughter is heard all over the house, will win a prize. He is
                the son of an auctioneer, of some fortune. There are two members of the press just
                entering- but the curtain rises. Adieu!" At the end of the performance, a shower of
                bouquets alighted upon the stage. Many of them were thrown from the box of the
                heiresses-and as many were retained by the belles, for their own gratification,
                being the tributes of one of their ad- mirers, whose father was a fashionable
                horticulturist. When Lucy and her aunt were conducted by Pollen along the densely
                thronged lobby towards the door opening on the street, they were followed by Lowe,
                who was attending the elderly lady which had been alluded to by him. She was very
                fair, and quite as fat as Miss Blount; and Lucy could not avoid hearing her
                expressions of admiration, when, upon turning her head, the lady had obtained a view
                of her features. No doubt, thought she, Lowe had been speaking of her to his
                companion, and the supposition was not a painful one. Arrived at the great steps in
                front of the theatre, there was some difficulty in finding their carriage. At length
                they were accosted by a small boy, who asked if their names were not Blount. Miss
                Flora answered in the affirmative. "Then here's your carriage," said the boy. "The
                driver can't leave the horses in this jam." And it was a jam. Car- riages were
                interlocked, and the people were struggling in every direction. As Pollen pushed
                through the dense crowd, following the boy, Lucy beheld Roland a few paces in
                advance, and a chill ran through her veins. But now they had reached the car- riage,
                the door of which was held open by the accommodating lad. 13* <pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6922-00000155"/> 298 THE WINKLES.
                "Here, my lad," said Flora, putting a shilling in his hand. "Thank'ee, mum," said
                he. As Lucy stepped in, she cast a look behind, and was startled to observe Lowe,
                standing on one of the steps in the vicinity. The rays of the lamp fell upon his
                face, and she saw he was deathly pale. And as she vanished, he clasped his forehead
                with his hand, and turned away, just when the driver cracked his whip. The horses
                moved off briskly, while Pollen was with great glee informing Miss Flora that his
                portfolio contained a sufficient quantity of manuscripts to make a vol- ume of the
                size demanded by the bookseller; and that he anticipated decided success, from the
                fact that he had written much of it in great distress of mind, and when out of favor
                with the world. He said that most of the great productions had been written under
                similar circumstances, which seemed to have caused an unusual concentration of mind
                on the sub- jects treated, and a more perfect abstraction from other ob- jects and
                influences. Lucy remained silent, and lost in unpleasant surmises, until the
                carriage stopped at her aunt's door. Then, upon descending to the pavement, it was
                discovered that they had been taken home in Roland's blue carriage! The lamp near
                which they alighted revealed the mistake they had made; and Flora and Pollen laughed
                very heartily at the occurrence. It was different with poor Lucy. She knew it was no
                inadvert- ence. She felt an agony at her heart, and clung to Pollen for support.
                Lowe had seen her enter the carriage, which he knew to be Roland's. That was the
                explanation of his de- spairing pallor and extraordinary gesture on the steps of the
                theatre. How, then, could she explain, the next morning? Would he call upon her,
                according to the appointment, after what he had witnessed? The carriage drove off,
                and the one that had taken them to the theatre arrived in great haste. "It was not
                my fault, madam," said the coachman. "They pushed me away from the front. I was
                hunting you, and saw you just when you was stepping up. I hallooed, but you couldn't
                hear me in the crowd. It wasn't my fault. But there was some foul play. I'll see who
                did it!" "Never mind, John," said Miss Flora. "It was only an amusing adventure.
                Don't get into a quarrel with any one on account of it." THE DOCTOR. 299 "Aunt,"
                said Lucy, in an earnest tone," pray let us go in. I am ill. They entered the house
                immediately. Upon beholding her niece, Flora exclaimed in alarm, that the dear girl
                was fainting, and caught her in her arms. "No, aunt," said Lucy, feebly; "I am not
                fainting. But I am not well. Pray conduct me to my room." "Mr. Pollen!" cried Flora,
                please go for the doctor- Dr. McGab!" n "No, aunt! I will be better, soon. But if
                not, do not send for him, if you have no one else's recommendation but Miss
                McCrabbed's." "Oh, he is a good physician." "I am better, aunt. I shall not require
                a doctor, I hope." But she did seem to require one the next day. After a restless
                night, she arose in the morning with a violent head- ache. And when the hour
                appointed by Lowe to see her had passed, and no communication from him had been
                received explaining the cause of his failure to attend, she seemed so much worse,
                that' her aunt was alarmed, and again entreat- ed her to let Dr. McGab be sent for.
                Lucy, not deeming it a case wherein the Esculapian might be usefully employed, still
                resisted. Her aunt then became very miserable herself. Lucy, she was quite sure, was
                very ill, or would be soon, and she feared she would be disappointed in the
                exhibition of her beautiful niece at the great party, where a living countess and a
                real lord would be present. Such apprehensions shocked her nerves to such a degree,
                that she was under the necessity of calling in the doctor for her own benefit. Dr.
                McGab was a tall gentleman, with red hair, and an intellectual face, said by some to
                resemble Thomas Jefferson's. His practice was pretty extensive, and as he possessed
                one of the essential characteristics of his country-an almost miracu- lous
                economy-he was growing wealthy. His income might increase-his expenditures never.
                The doctor entered the parlor where Lucy was sitting alone. "Good morning, Miss
                Winkle," said he, sitting down be- side her on the sofa. I am sorry to see you
                looking so badly. A little nervous excitement, perhaps; your aunt is a <pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6922-00000156"/>

                truly, truly." Lucy smiled at his earnestness of manner, and his habit- ual
                repetition of the final word of his sentences. "No, doctor," said she, "I think
                not." "But you don't look well, not well, not well." "A headache, merely. It was my
                aunt---" "I know. My professional visit is to her. I will see her when she is ready.
                She must put on a ribbon, or something of the sort, before I can be admitted. The
                ladies are all alike. The doctor must be delayed for some adjustment of costume or
                furniture, even in cases of imminent danger. All alike, alike, alike." "I am sure,
                doctor, you ought to be flattered by it," re- plied Lucy. "I am-when the delay is
                not too long-and it cannot be in this instance, instance. But the door opens for me,
                and I may go up, now, now. I will leave my gloves with you, you, you," continued the
                doctor, striding away. He found Miss Flora prostrated by the severest attack she had
                ever experienced, and really requiring his aid. After writing a prescription, and
                leaving particular directions for her to remain as nearly as possible immovable, he
                returned to the parlor. "How is my aunt, doctor?" asked Lucy. "The attack is severe,
                severe. She must not be startled -not disturbed. I have sent for the medicine. She
                orders me to see you. Your pulse, pulse," he continued, taking the wrist of Lucy in
                his hand. "I hope my case will not require medicine, doctor," said she. "No. But it
                is not right-not right. Your tongue, tongue. Nothing, nothing. Good
                constitution-some little excitement. No medicine-no medicine." "I am glad to hear
                it, doctor." "So am Hso am I. Be well to-morrow, or next day- next day. McCrabbed
                gone, eh? Bad woman." "She was indeed, doctor." "Sorry for it, sorry for it.

                heir, heir." "Pray release my wrist, doctor," said Lucy, almost BEAUTY'S SLAVE. 301
                alarmed at the violence of the grasp with which the doctor held it. "Certainly,"
                said the doctor, releasing her wrist, but re- taining her hand, and sliding down on
                his knee; "Miss Winkle," he continued," I am a bachelor. Not old-not old. J I love
                you, have loved you, ever since I saw you first, first, first-" ".Dr. McGab "
                "Seriously, seriously, seriously. Upon my honor, honor, honor. Is there hope, hope,
                hope?" L "I fear not, doctor!" said Lucy, springing up, and with difficulty
                preserving her gravity of countenance. L "Say hope, hope, hope!" continued the
                doctor, still rest- ing on one knee. "I cannot. I must not deceive you. I fear it is
                a des. perate case, she added, turning away, and holding her hand- kerchief to her
                mouth. "Think of it, think of it," said the doctor rising. "Pause --reflect-no hasty
                prognosis--um--the profession! Dream on it, dream on it. See you again, again,
                again," continued he, withdrawing. There are your gloves, doctor," said Lucy.
                True-nervous myself, myself, myself," he kept repeat- ing, until he passed out of
                the hall door and disappeared in the street. Then Lucy threw herself down on the
                sofa, and in spite of all her endeavors to the contrary, gave vent to a prolonged ft
                of laughter. And when this subsided, she was surprised to find her head had ceased
                to pain her. The doctor had cer- tainly effected a cure. It was, perhaps, fortunate
                that Lucy's spirits had made such a rebound. - The depression which had afflicted
                her, if not dispelled, would have rendered her incapable of bearing with fortitude
                that which was to follow. For, not many min- utes after the departure of Dr. McGab,
                and when she was sitting beside her aunt, a letter was placed in her hand by a
                servant, who said the bearer did not await a reply. Lucy knew the writing--but
                steeled her heart to bear with equa- nimity whatever might be traced by her
                suspicious lover-for in that light she could not avoid regarding him-while at the
                same time she could not deny that he had ample cause to be filled with doubt and
                apprehension. Yet- she felt that she <pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6922-00000157"/> 102 THE WINKLES. :ould nQt quite forgive
                him for entertaining a mistrust, which iould have instantly vanished if his decision
                had been delayed mtil he had obtained an explanation. "Read the letter, child," said
                Miss Flora. "I am much better, since your color has returned. What a strange thing s
                sympathy! It seems to me the relief you have obtained has ikewise relieved me, in a
                great degree." "I wish, aunt," said Lucy, "you were sufficiently recov. ared to hear
                me with composure-before I break the seal of this letter." "Who is it from? I am
                composed, now. What would you say?" "Oh, it is a long tale-a-- " "Love tale?" "Yes."
                "Then I can hear it!" said Flora, rising on her elbow. "Such tales never shock my
                nerves; on the contrary, they tranquillize me. It will cure me, Lucy. I desire you
                will proceed." Lucy related every thing which had occurred between her- self and
                Lowe, up to the moment when she saw him strike his forehead, as she unconsciously
                entered the blue carriage. "It is a romance!" said her aunt, rising. "You see it has
                nearly cured me. I will rise and sit by the fire. But who is Mr. Lowe?" I know
                not-but I suspect-- " said Lucy, and she would say no more. "He seems to be a
                gentleman," said her aunt. Oh, yes." Read his letter, Lucy. No doubt he reproaches
                you. If he does, what will you do? Make up your mind for the worst, and then- --" "I
                think 'I shall not faint, aunt-nor even turn pale. He should have seen me-should
                have heard me. I will read it aloud-and withhold nothing from you." "That is a dear
                child," said Flora, kissing her! The letter was as follows: "Our eyes met as you
                were entering Roland's carriage, The wound which I experienced then, I fear can
                never be healed. After beholding what I did, of course you could not be prepared to
                see me to-day. Oh, Lucy! you will never meet with a truer heart than mine I No one
                will ever adore you as I have done-as I still do- THE PESPAIRING LOVER. 303 for I
                cannot forbear to love you, deeply wounded as I am. I write incoherently, in unison
                with the confused ebullition of my feelings. And is such to be the termination of my
                happy dream? My mystery was upon the eve of a solution-I was about to vindicate my
                pretensions in open day, challenging the whole world to suggest any good reason why
                you should not be mine-mine irrevocably. But-how bitterly have I been
                disappointed!-I will not say deceived-for reproaches were useless. Farewell This is
                the last line you will ever receive from LOWE." Lucy was not violently agitated, nor
                excessively pale; but she uttered a low sigh, and felt an oppression at her heart.
                Do not believe him, Lucy. He loves you dearly," said her aunt , and will never
                abandon the pursuit until you dis- card him.?' "That he supposes I have already
                done," said Lucy, sadly smiling through the glittering tears which relieved her.
                "But he should have seen me, and heard me. One word of expla- nation would have been
                sufficient." "' Pshaw! Lucy, have you not read novels enough to know there can be no
                true and passionate affection, without these ruptures, and farewells, and despairs?
                I would never marry, unless my lover had first proved the strength of his affection
                by just such extravagant paroxysms. Depend upon it, he will again throw himself at
                your feet. But who is he? What mystery does he allude to?" "You know as much as I
                do, aunt." "Then we must both know more, before I shall consent to a
                reconciliation." "I fear the rupture is past healing, aunt. But he has done me
                injustice. He gave me no opportunity to explain my apparent inconstancy. Ah-here is
                his number, beneath his name-done in pencil mark-an after thought!" "He believes you
                will write him." "Possibly. But I will not. No, aunt; he has been pre- cipitate. I
                know his conduct may be attributed to the ardor of his affection-but still I cannot
                submit to act the humilia- ting part of a petitioner, and plead my own
                justification." "Spoken like a Blount, and a Winkle I Will he be at the great
                party?" "I do not know.. But I think it probable." <pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6922-00000158"/> "I hope so. We will meet him
                there. You must be firm and independent."' " I fear I shall be too dull to go, aunt.
                And I am sure, from what the doctor said, it will not be prudent for you to be
                there." " Dr. McGab is sometimes mistaken, though he does un- derstand my
                constitution better than I do myself. We must go. At least you must. Ah! I am
                sinking again. Why, why did the doctor have the cruelty to say such dreadful things
                !" Lucy led her aunt to her couch, and administered another anodyne, according to
                the physician's directions. CHAPTER XXVII. THE LORD AND LADY AT THE GRAND PARTY-A
                CHALLENGE-THE BLUE CARRIAGE--THE DUEL. IT was the grand night of the season, and
                Mrs. Laurel was in her glory. Her fine mansion was overflowing with the fashion. and
                aristocracy, and wealth, and talents of the city. Dancing, singing, laughing,
                scandal, and all the train of enjoyments possible on such an occasion, characterized
                the entertainment. Miss Flora Blount was confined to her couch, with just sufficient
                strength to turn over the leaves of the last American novel, which had been
                recommended by Pollen. The poet had the honor of conducting Lucy to Mrs. Laurel's,
                in obedi- ence to the peremptory command of Flora, who would not lis. ten to Lucy's
                reasons for desiring to stay at home. Miss Wilsome Winkle had signified her
                intention of being present. But in a subsequent note she stated that a whist party
                had been formed in Philadelphia, to meet at her own house on the night of Mrs.
                Laurel's reception, and hence she could not come. The Arum and Crudle belles were
                there, but not accom- panied by the fluttering dandies that had surrounded them at
                the theatre. Not one of them had been deemed of sufficient elevation in society to
                be invited thither. Butt the girls en- listed, or rather impressed into their
                service, a dilapidated old colonel, -boarding at the same house. Ie made every
                objee. tion in his power, even exhibiting the stump of the arm which had been
                carried away by a cannon ball, alleging the impossi: bility of leading two regiments
                into action--but to no purpose. Miss Crudle said she would be contented with the
                stump, and endeavor to conceal his deficiency of limb. Of course he put on his
                regimentals, and the girls were exceedingly proud of their military conductor, who
                was, however, an ill-natured and snappish specimen of his profession, and would not
                allow them to make any disparaging remarks on the poet and Lucy, whom he said were
                the finest looking persons in the saloons. But when the Babbleton misses had made
                the rounds of the mansion, and exhibited their jewels and the colonel's buttons to
                every body, they contrived to engage the attention of Ro- land, who, most
                singularly, did not now seem to desire to ap- proah Lucy, or to annoy her with his
                attentions. On the contrary, he listened with pleasure to the detracting observa-
                tions of Miss Arum, on Lucy's dress, her carriage, her com- plexion, and her very
                equivocal intimacy with Lowe, who was again supposed to be a forger, or something of
                the sort And he not only participated in the laughter at the expense of their
                village neighbor, as he called Lucy, but added many items of deteriorating scandal
                himself, which, being ompre- hended by the quick ear of Col. Ball, that gentleman
                immedi. ately abandoned his gossiping companions. He then sought for Pollen. He
                found him just when Lucy was taken posses- sion of by Mrs. Laurel, who was to
                introduce her to her par- ticular female friends, and first among them was the
                countess, whose appearance was every moment expected. I have not the pleasure of
                bein g acquainted with you, said the colonel to the poet, " but hope I shall enjoy
                the hap- piness of being your friend.") " My name is Pollen--- " " The poet! Oh, I
                know you very well." "You were once my commander, Colonel Ball. I was a "True, true!
                I am happy to meet with ou on this occasion, and I am glad, you have w on

                my criticisms are written with a stiletto. I do not wonder at it. They have enraged
                me by their injus- tice, and when I have an opportunity, I cannot restrain my arm.
                If they will goad the porcupine, let them beware of his quills!" "Well said, Pollen.
                And now, do you know that you have an enemy in this house?" "An enemy? Say twenty.
                There are a score of critics and publishers present who sneer at my pretensions as
                an au- thor-merely because I am an American." "Pooh-nonsense-what difference does it
                make, in the republic of letters, where a writer was born? Or a gen- eral? Bonaparte
                was a native of Corsica, a contemptible - island. No, sir; I can tell you the reason
                why your name is not in every paper, and your books in every library." "Then you
                will much oblige me." "I will, sir. You have true merit, and relying upon that, you
                have not conciliated the censors of American litera. ture by cringing to them, or by
                purchasing their praises. It was so with Shakspeare, and Milton, and Pope, sir; with
                De- foe, Fielding and Smollett. None of them were sufficiently reverenced while
                they. lived. Their thrifty neighbors, the tradesmen, who made fortunes by their
                cunning indus- try, or by dishonest practices, looked upon those great immor- tals
                with indifference or contempt, and some of them suffered for bread and raiment, sir.
                But they were fools, sir, for neg- lecting their own interests, while providing
                instruction and entertainment for future generations, who have not the power of
                throwing them a crust. And I am a fool, sir, for fol- lowing their example and
                yours. If I had spent my fur- loughs in Washington, and danced attendance on the
                secreta- ry, and loved all the dogs who wore the President's collar, I might have
                been a general, sir. But I would see them --- first, sir!-but I am getting warm, and
                these rooms are too much crowded. Step aside with me," he continued, in a lower
                voice. And, when they gained a recess between two col- umns that had been imported
                from Greece, he said; "Pollen, you have been insulted to-night, and you must shoot
                the ras- cal." "I? oh, that is nothing. Some one condemning my writr ings. I would
                rather be abused than entirely neglected." INCIDENTS OF THE BALL. 307 "No, sir: I
                don't mean that. Do you know yonder red. faced man entertaining the Babbleton
                girls?" "Roland? Yes, I know him." "Roland-yes. they said that was his name, but I
                did not recognize the introduction. He has slandered the beautiful creature who was
                hanging on your arm." "Miss Winkle?" It must have been Miss Winkle. I never saw her
                be- fore, but I knew her mother. She was a belle, and this lady re- minded me of
                her. Well, sir, those Babbleton dunces and Mr. Roland are making very disparaging
                comments on her appear- ance and conduct. The females can say what they like with
                impunity, but the male must be called to an account. I will see him in your behalf.
                I will be your friend, and we will settle the matter early in the morning over in
                Jersey." "Colonel, I do not wish to engage in any such-- "Pooh! Nonsense! But here
                is Mrs. Laurel calling for you. Go with her, and leave the rest to me." "But,
                Colonel Ball-be sure and let me see you first." "You shall-you shall," cried the
                colonel, vanishing in the crowd. "Come, sir" said Mrs. Laurel, "you are my prisoner,
                un- til I resign you to the countess, who is at the other end of the saloon. Mr.
                Laurel is limping about' with Lucy on his arm, and will introduce the earl when he
                shows himself. Did yousmell the gas in the hall? I know you did. My new man turned
                the gas into the house, and the heat up the chimney! Mr. Pollen, no one ever had
                such trials and trou- bles as myself with servants. And it does no good to dis-
                charge them and employ others. They are all alike, and get spoiled directly. But
                here we are. There's her ladyship. How fat and and fair she is. As soon as that
                party retires I will introduce you. Afterwards you must keep near enough to converse
                with her when she turns her face towards you. And you need not be particularly nice
                in your words. She is merely a well-bred woman, like millions of your countrywo-
                men. She is perfectly enchanted with Lucy Winkle, and says she is the most beautiful
                creature she ever beheld." Upon being introduced to the countess, Pollen was charm-
                ed to learn that she had read some of his productions in her Own country, and that
                they were attracting attention-quite <pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6922-00000160"/> 308 THE WINKLES. as much, and quite as
                deservedly, she intimated, as the writ- ings of contemporary British poets. It was a
                great triumph for Pollen to be so complimented by the lioness of the evening, and to
                be detained at her side, while so many parties of ladies and gentlemen were advan-
                cing to be presented, and retiring to make room for others. Among the rest who
                merely received a bow, a smile and a monosyllable from her ladyship, were the
                Babbleton belles, who were led forward by Roland. They were amazed at the
                undisguised partiality exhibited by her ladyship for the con- versation of Pollen.
                Passing on, Miss Arum drew the attention of Miss Crudle and of Roland to the fact,
                that Mr. Laurel had taken Lucy Winkle under his protection, and seemed to be
                introdu- cing all the young gentlemen who fell in his way. "He is deceived," said
                Miss Arum. "And he'll soon find out his mistake," said Miss Crudle. "That he shall!"
                rejoined the other. "I will tell Mrs. Laurel, myself, of the suspicious transactions
                between her and Mr. Lowe. I wonder he ain't here too." "I see him!" said Roland, who
                was tall as well as large, and could overlook the company. "He is coming this way,
                and seems to be surrounded by many acquaintances. Sup- pose we withdraw to the other
                end of the room." "Oh, no!" said Miss Arum, "I want to see how Lucy Winkle can have
                the audacity to hold up her head before him in such a place as this. " "And I want
                to see how he will look when he meets her," said Miss Crudle. "And I am sure Mrs.
                Laurel must have been imposed on, or she never would have invited him." "Oh, as for
                that, he might do well enough for genteel company, if he did not devote all his time
                and attention to that proud piece of poverty." "If you -will remain, ladies," said
                Roland, " you must ex- cuse me, I must seek the cold air on the balcony to cure a
                slight headache-but we will meet again. And yonder comes the colonel. I do not like
                his looks, and will avoid him. He will stand by you, if you seize his arm, until I
                return." Roland disappeared on the left, and the colonel emerged from the crowd on
                the right, and was instantly seized by the young ladies. "Pinioned, eh?" said he.
                "Well, I must submit." WHO WAS THE LORD? 309 "Fie, colonel," said Miss Arum, "of
                course you must submit, and you ought to do so with a better grace." "I do believe
                he was frowning," said Miss Crudle. "But I will make him smile. Yonder comes the
                gentleman, colonel, " she continued, "who carried Miss Winkle's heart by storm. It
                does not appear, however, that there was a very desperate resistance." "ew could
                resist his approaches. I wish he would approach i us, and test the experiment. You
                know him?" "Know him! certainly. Mr. Lowe has been a resident of Babbleton for many
                months; and with the exception of his conduct to Lucy Winkle- -" "What the deuce is
                all this about? I cannot understand a word of it. Mr. Lowe-and residing at
                Babbleton-and conduct so. Do you mean that gentleman accosting Mr. Laurel? Come
                nearer that you may see more distinctly." "Certainly," said the girls. "That is Mr
                Lowe - "No such thing!" cried the colonel. "My lord," said Mr. Laurel, "this is
                Miss. Winkle. Lucy, this is the Earl of Hilton." Lucy, pale, but collected-for she
                had recently suspected such would be the denouement, and had resolved to manifest no
                extraordinary emotion-bowed, without averting her eyes, and yet without seeking a
                recognition. His lordship, quite as pale as herself, and with traces of recent grief
                upon his face, lingered a moment at her side, and whispered something in her ear,
                while the unconscious crowd gazed in admiration.. He then joined his mother, who
                beckoned him away for the pur- pose of introducing the poet. "I'm trembling all
                over, Susan!" said Miss Arum. "I'm petrified, Bell!" said Miss Crudle. "The deuce
                you are!" said the colonel. "I thought you were both better soldiers. What! not
                stand the fire of a lord's eyes, when you have been browheating a colonel, who,
                perhaps, killed a dozen noblemen in the last war?" "Who even dreamt such a thing
                possible " said Bell. What's that you call him?2 " asked the colonel. " He is as
                fine a looking fellow as your husband will be." "I am amazed!" said Susan. "It is a
                wonder you are not stricken dumb," said the colonel. "But yonder is my man," he
                continued, seeing Roland enter from the balcony. "Sit on this sofa, ladies, <pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC6922-00000161"/>

                communicate to a certain person on the other side of the room." And he hurried
                across. "And he's a lord I " exclaimed Miss Arum. "The Earl of Hilton!" said Miss
                Crudle. "And has been living all this time in Babbleton, and we not to know, or to
                suspect who he was " "And to be suspected of being a pickpocket, a counter- feiter,
                a forger!" "An adventurer, that we thought had deceived Lucy Winkle!" "Deceitful
                wretch! She has deceived us all! No doubt she knew all about him!" "Mr. Roland
                didn't know he was a lord any more than the rest of us," said Miss Arum. "No, he did
                not-and he thought Lucy's conduct very disgraceful. Yonder he is. Let us go to him,
                and tell him what a ridiculous mistake we have made." As they moved away, they
                turned their eyes aside and dis- covered the earl, who had escaped from his mother,
                standing beside Lucy in a dark recess; and they had doubtless been involuntary
                listeners. "I have been bewildered, Lucy-perhaps deluded by the creations of my own
                imagination," said Lord Hilton. "Oh, assure me it has been so! Lift me from my
                miserable abyss, and I shall be truly happy!" "My lord, I know not what to say. I
                have not sought to plunge you into an abyss of misery. I have not censured your
                conduct; and mine, I am sure, has not merited your condemnation. If it has, however,
                appeared to be inexplica- ble, it is because you did not seek to comprehend it; and
                it did not become me to solicit your attention for the purpose of imposing upon your
                patience any tedious and unnecessary ex- planations." "Tedious and unnecessary
                explanations Oh, Lucy, do, not term them so! You would not, I am sure, if you knew
                what a cloud of woe a few words of thine would dispel from my tortured existence."
                "No! I cannot submit to assume the abasing attitude of a humble petitioner to be
                heard in my own justification Words could be of no avail, if my truth were doubted.

                you have long known each other. Perhaps Lord Hilton, if his abode in this country
                were prolonged, might be in danger of becoming Americanized." "I would not
                unwittingly imperil his safety, madam," said Lucy. And if I may judge from the
                sentiments I have heard him repeatedly express, I doubt whether a longer sojourn
                among us would induce him to relinquish the franchises of his native land." "She
                speaks truly, madam. The force of education nd old associations, may not easily be
                overcome by the temp- tations of a new country, however attractive they may be."
                "Still, it does appear to me that there are dangerous at- tractions here. Yet your
                old associations must be peculiarly strong. -Miss Winkle cannot be aware of the
                precise nature of the inducement which tempts you to return to your own country at
                this juncture; and which alone could have induced me to cross the stormy ocean to
                hasten your departure, and ac- company you back." "I cannot be aware of the
                particular object of a sudden departure, madam," said Lucy; " but I may readily
                perceive why one of his possessions and prospects, would naturally be impatient to
                realize the advantages of the position which awaits him." "Oh, that no doubt is very
                correct in meaning; but the possessions and prospects,' in his particular case, I
                may say, since I understand an honorable friendship has subsisted be- tween you,
                depend, perhaps, to a very considerable extent, upon the celerity of his movements,
                and upon the condition of his immediate appearance in England." I hope, my dear
                mother," said his lordship, with some- thing resembling vexation, that-my immediate
                return cannot be so urgently demanded as your words would seem to imply.' "I am very
                sure," said Lucy, with decided emphasis, "that *K^. <pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC6922-00000162"/> 312 THE WINKLES.
                neither my countrymen, nor countrywomen would desire to in. terpose any obstacles
                which might delay his lordship's return to his native land; and particularly, if a
                longer absence from his country might produce loss of fortune, or involve sacrifices
                of any other nature." At that moment Pollen appeared at Lucy's side, and tak. ing
                his arm, she was hidden from the view of Lord Hilton by the parties continually
                surrounding the noble guest. As the poet strode along muttering his thoughts as
                usual, for the fiat teries of the countess had lifted him into the world of revery,
                he came in contact with Roland, who paused suddenly before him, but with his face
                the other way. Roland was confronted by Colonel Ball, and Lucy could not avoid
                listening to what passed between them. "Mr. Roland," said the colonel, "will you
                furnish me with your address?" "With great pleasure," replied Roland, presenting his
                card. "I presume," continued the colonel, you can have no difti culty in
                conjecturing my object in soliciting your address?" "To be frank with you," said
                Roland, "I am at a loss to know the nature of your business, unless you want to
                borrow money. I have a sum in this city just now unemployed, and may be able to
                accommodate you." The-colonel was silent for several moments. If they had been in
                the street, no doubt, in the first fermentation of his wrath, he 'would have aimed a
                blow at the rich civilian. But, while he paused he reflected. The random shot had
                not missed the mark. The colonel was a borrower. His salary did not suffice for his
                expenses, and he was always in debt. So, suppressing any remnant of his first
                indignation, he resolved, after the duel, if Roland behaved well in the field, to
                cultivate his ac- quaintance. "No-that is not it," he replied. "It is quite a
                different matter. I am the friend of Mr. Pollen." '"I am very glad to hear it," said
                Roland. ' I am likewise the poet's friend." "But you have insulted him-and he
                demands satisfaction, to morrow morning, at Hoboken." "Insulted him I No,
                colonel-there is some mistake in the matter."e "'Mistake?. Pooh! Suppose there s-ldl
                be.? Why, it A DUEL IN PROSPECT. 313 can be explained on the field. Mistake or no
                mistake, there can be no explanation after the challenge, but with pistol in hand.
                You will be there, of course, accompanied by your friend." Roland did not assent.
                But the colonel did not observe the negative shake of his head, or stay to, hear his
                objections. Roland, being just then met by the Babbleton belles, diverged from the
                direction he had been pursuing, when Pollen and Lucy were confronted by the colonel.
                "Well met, well met " said the colonel to the poet, whose eye was in a' frenzy
                rolling,' and who had not comprehended the matter at all. "All is arranged. A deal
                of trouble will be saved. Remember, at Hoboken. before sunrise. I will take my case
                of pistols. Adieu till then." "Mr. Pollen!" said Lucy, when the colonel had dis-
                appeared. "Ay-I shall go to London. The countess has promised to defray the
                expense." "But this duel, Mr. Pollen. Surely you will not fight?" "The English are
                generous in their patronage of authors. The countess enumerated-but I have forgotten
                how many-- those who have pensions-- " ' But why did you challenge Mr. Roland? Oh,
                beware of him!" "They may let loose the reins of fancy-and dwell in an empyreal
                atmosphere, without racking their brains in devising the ways and means of
                discharging a bootmaker's bill." "But, Mr. Pollen!" continued Lucy, shaking his arm.
                "Who patronizes authors here? Who pays them pen- sions? Not even the rich
                publishers! One of mine refused to speak to me one day because my coat was rent, and
                he had consumed the profits of my book. But I will abandon the country! I will go! I
                will!" And releasing himself, he abandoned his fair charge, and rushed out of the
                house. Poor Lucy retreated to the friendly recess which had be- fore sheltered her
                from the many oppressive glances of the guests, who, however, only gazed in
                admiration. Here she sat alone, a prey to many painful emotions. The poet had been
                attacked by one of his fits, and Lowe-or rather the earl -had disappeared. Roland
                was near, and she was now quite unattended! Nor was this all-for upon looking round,
                she " <pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC6922-00000163"/> 314 THE, WINKLES. discovered the Arum and Crudle belles seated
                within a few paces of her, and Roland conversing with them. They were moreover
                looking at her, and their whispers could sometimes be heard. "Patience on a
                monument," and the " willow tree," were jeeringly uttered, while Roland, with his
                face averted, seemed to enjoy the scene. Mr. Henry Milior, who had watched every
                movement and expression of Lucy during the evening, but had forborne to approach,
                now joined her, seeing she was entirely alone. And this caused a sensation in the
                breasts of the Misses Arum and Crudle. Henry had been introduced to them at an early
                hour by the colonel, whose real object was to be relieved of the duty of conducting
                them home; and they, upon seeing him approach, supposed of course themselves to be
                the object of attraction. But their disappointment was apparent in the vexed
                expression of their lips, when he bowed slightly, and passed on to where Lucy was
                sitting. "Miss Winkle," said he, manifesting his lively joy on tak. ing possession
                of a seat at her side, "I am happy to have an opportunity of inquiring if it be true
                that Lord Hilton has been residing for months in your village?" "It is true. But he
                was known only as Mr. Edmund Lowe." "Mr. Laurel says his name his Edward Lowe Dale.
                You were acquainted with him?" "Oh yes." ' His manners are fine. He must have been
                an agreeable acquaintance." "He was, indeed," said Lucy, in a slightly agitated
                voice, which Milnor perceived, but did not suspect the cause of it. The countess, I
                learn from the British Secretary of Le. gation-the Mr. Ponsonby, with the light hair
                and youthful face, who was introduced to you by Mr. Laurel-has arranged a great
                match for him in England." "Indeed!" said Lucy, throwing off the listlessness which
                had seemed to oppress her. "And do the mothers in England arrange such matters for
                their sons " "Just as our mothers do-here, by skill, intrigue and strata- gem. But I
                am told the young lady she has chosen is one of the most beautiful heiresses in the
                kingdom." "Did you hear her name But why need I ask? I could PAINFUL INTELLIGENCE.
                315 never have heard it-I, a commoner, as they call those who inherit no title," But
                you have heard it, or at least read it in the list of the queen's noble ladies of
                honor. It is Lady Stuart. And they say she has royal blood in her veins. I learn
                that the late Earl of Hilton, the present earl's brother, left the estates somewhat
                encumbered, and this marriage is to repair the damaged fortunes of the house. You
                seem to be ill, Miss Winkle. Can I be of any service? Shall I seek Mr. Pollen for
                you?" "I thank you. But it would be useless to seek him. He is in one of his
                reveries, and is in all probability standing in the midst of the square in front of
                the house, gazing at the stars, and uttering poetical incantations. I will thank
                you, however, Mr. Milnor, to accompany me home. I am not well, and would return to
                my aunt." "With the greatest pleasure," said Henry; "but as I might not be able to
                find your carriage, with your permission I will use my mother's. She will remain at
                least an hour yet." Lucy, without hesitation, accompanied Milnor into the room,
                where the voluble hostess was expatiating on the trials and troubles of American
                housekeepers, and dwelling particularly on the item of domestics. Roland, seeing the
                colonel again ap- proaching from another direction, and not desiring to lose sight
                of Lucy, endeavored to keep in view of her, but found it imprac- ticable to do so,
                when she had taken her leave of the countess and Mrs. Laurel, and passed into the
                cloaking room. But, having heard her express a desire to depart immediately, and not
                doubting she would fall into the trap he had prepared, he hastened into the street,
                and walked briskly in the direction of Miss Flora's mansion. Lord Hilton had
                likewise kept Lucy in view, himself un- seen. And he had also comprehended the
                intentions of Roland, and prepared a counter-plot for him. Two of the countess's
                most intelligent servants, the coachman and foot- man, were his confederates. One of
                them was dressed as much like Milnor as possible, and the other put on female
                apparel, of the color and in imitation of Lucy's dress. This couple, when Lucy
                entered the cloaking room, and after Roland had stepped into the street, and
                signalled his man of the approach of the party, were directed to descend the marble
                    <pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC6922-00000164"/> 316 THE WINKLES. steps. When Miss Blount's carriage was called
                for, Rolanact blue one drove up to the curb with open door, and the dis. guised
                couple stepped into it. Immediately the sound of the whip was heard, and the wheels
                were in rapid motion. The sleepy driver of Flora's carriage had just been made
                acquainted with the fact that he had been called, when Milnor and Lucy appeared. But
                cursing his unlucky stars, he drove off furiously, and was overturned by coming in
                collision with an omnibus before proceeding a hundred paces. Mr. Milnor had no
                difficulty in finding his mother's car. riage, in which he placed his charge, and
                they were driven away slowly and carefully. Meantime the blue carriage progressed
                most gloriously; and when it overtook and passed Roland, who was pursuing the same
                direction, the driver signified that all was well. Arrived in front of the Blount
                mansion, Roland's driver 'descended and threw open the door. But instead of stepping
                out, the couple inside, in pursuance of their preconcerted agreement, only snored
                aloud, and remained perfectly still. "Wake up, in there, if you please," said the
                driver. A double snore was the answer. "Hallo! I say! Somebody must 'ave put opium
                in their wine!" said the driver. "Come," he continued, thrusting in his hand and
                shaking one of his passengers-" this ain't the blue chamber in the Red Anchor! Wake
                up and go to bed, I say!" "Go about your business," said the inside coachman, "or
                I'll tickle your hears." "Tickle my hears-and in that strange voice! Come, captain,
                you'll have to interpret that for me. I can't under- stand it, no how." "I'll
                hindeavor to do hit," said-the countess's coachman descending-the footman in female
                apparel still remaining inside. "Hindeavor to do hit! What's that? Does it mean to
                hit me?" "Hit does " said the other, and at the same time dealing a blow upon the
                nose of Roland's man, which laid him on his back. The victor then, in obedience to
                his instructions, im- mediately detached the horses from the carriage, and fastened
                them to a tree that stood opposite the house. "Now I'll have my fare," said Roland's
                man, recovering, THE WRONG PASSENGERS. 317 and regaining his feet, "if you are a
                poet." He aimed a blow at his antagonist, as he approached him, which was easily
                parried, for the countess's men were both regular bruisers, having learned the
                "noble art of self-defence," under the most approved instructors at home. Again
                Roland's man was knocked down; and the punishment was repeated as often as he gained
                his feet, until Roland himself appeared on the field of action. s What-does this
                mean?" demanded he. "Paddy, where is the lady?" "In the carriage, sir. But I'll
                never drive her home again if she has a poet with her-no, not for twenty dollars.
                I'm whipped, sir. I acknowledge the corn. And Ihope you are satisfied, Mr. Poet."
                "Is she in the carriage?" asked Roland, approaching the door, where he could see the
                outline of the supposed lady. Then ordering his man to get the horses again and
                drive to the Red Anchor, he bounded in, but was prevented from closing the door by
                the victor outside, who forcibly held it open. "My adorable Lucy," said he, "you see
                that fate has decreed you mine." At one bound the pretended woman sprang out. Roland
                followed quickly. He seized his prize-but with a well- aimed blow the disguised
                footman laid him in the gutter under the carriage. "Fury! Who did that?" exclaimed
                Roland, scrambling up, and again approaching the supposed Lucy, who stood with his
                face averted-but turned when the pursuer placed his hand on him, and again
                prostrated the iniquitous plotter. Fury! They are men!" cried Roland, rising once
                more while the blood gushed from his nose. "Drive away as soon as possible, Paddy,"
                he continued, removing away himself with all the expedition in his power, and
                followed by the British bruisers, who laughed heartily at his expense. By the time
                Paddy had replaced the horses and cracked his whip, Mr. Milnor and Lucy arrived.
                They descended at the door without uttering a word, and when Lucy entered the
                mansion, Milnor bowed in silence to her low "good night," and despondingly
                re-entered the coach. During the passage rom the Laurel mansion, the young man had
                made a formal ender of his heart and hand; and although they had been <pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC6922-00000165"/>

                been surrendered for ever, and could never be reclaimed. Hence he was truly
                disheartened. It seemed that wherever Lucy appeared, she was destined to lead
                captive the hearts of others, without designing it, or without being conscious of
                the mischief her beauty wrought; and this was another source of unhappiness,-for she
                would not have willingly inflicted pain upon others, however much they might
                distress her by a hopeless pursuit of the love which could be possessed only by the
                one who had long since won her young and confiding heart. The next morning at early
                dawn, Colonel Ball was stand- ing on the margin of the river, at Iloboken, with a
                pistol-case in his hand, and impatiently awaiting the arrival of his prin. cipal, as
                well that of the opposing party. An invisible reporter of the Herald, who had
                mysteriously obtained an intimation of the nature of the enterprise in
                contemplation, watched the motions of the colonel, and, like him, awaited the
                arrival upon the ground of the remainder of the dramatis personae. The colonel
                whistled, and stamped to keep himself warm, for it was a bright frosty morning. He
                then measured the ground with a most scrupulous impartiality, and tried both
                positions himself, his fancy supplying the supposed antagonist. "Why the deuce don't
                they come?" he exclaimed, petu- lantly, after making a careful reconnoissance of the
                approaches, which resulted unsatisfactorily. He then placed the case on the ground,
                and beat his hand against his side to keep it warm. "Will there be a duel this
                morning?" asked the shivering reporter, unable any longer to stand his ground behind
                the tree. ': Where the deuce did you come from?" asked the colonel, staring in utter
                astonishment at the thickly-enveloped reporter, who was a corpulent Englishman, and
                professed to be familiar with the duello. "From behind that tree, where I have been
                freezing this half-hour, and could endure it no longer." And why were you standing
                there?" "To witness the duel." "You like the sport " "Very much. I have witnessed
                twenty in England, and reported them all." HOW TO GET UP A DUEL. 319 "Reported them?
                Are you a reporter?" "Yes, colonel, and I will do you justice. You may read my
                account before it goes to press." "And you know who I am?" "Colonel Ball. You shot
                Mr. M---" "A mistake, sir. He shot me; and a d--- bad shot it was, to aim at my body
                and strike my leg. But it seems we are not to be entertained this morning. I fear
                the parties are not men of honor." "Cowards, perhaps." "Ay, the same thing. A man of
                honor cannot be a coward -a coward cannot be a man of honor-eh?" "I agree with you,
                colonel." "You are, no doubt, a man of honor?" I hope so, colonel." "We'll see. Both
                my man and the other principal are poltroons; they will not be present. But I must
                smell gun- powder, and you must fight me," added the colonel, taking up the brace of
                pistols. "I fight you, colonel?" "Yes, certainly. You will not require me to insult
                you. I never do that without very strong provocation. We'll dis- pense with it, and
                just have a delightful exchange of shots and then return together to the city, on
                the most friendly terms imaginable. I take it for granted you will not report the
                occurrence." "Ha, ha, ha! you are facetious, colonel." "No, upon my honor! We shall
                have an exchange of shots, if I am a man of veracity. There, take your choice,"
                continued the colonel, advancing with the pistols, the muzzles towards himself. '
                You must excuse me, colonel," said the reporter, retreat- ing to the tree. '"I will
                not exchange shots with you." "You shall, by Jupiter! Here, I place this pistol on
                the ground at the root of the tree, and will step off ten paces. At the word 'fire,'
                either party is at liberty to pull trigger." "I will not take it, Colonel Ball. I
                will not exchange shots with you. We have no quarrel." "Oh, are you waiting for
                that? I thought an insult might be dispensed with between gentlemen. Well, you are a
                coward. Now, if you will not fire, according to your own admission, you cannot be a
                man of honor." ' *.. <pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC6922-00000166"/> 20 ' THE WINKLES. " I will not exchange shots with you."
                " Nonsense I You must have something to report. Take up the pistol, and be ready. At
                the word I shall fire. One -two--three-Fire! " But the colonel did not fire. The
                reporter vanished behind the tree, and there was no mark to shoot at. The colonel
                walked round at a quick step. The reporter peeped from behind, without exposing his
                hea and merely far enough to see the colonel's heel, as it was-lifted up in the.
                pursuit. Round and round they continued to go, the distance never diminishing
                between them; but as the colonel's round was much the greatest in circumference, it
                might be supposed he was the most violently exercised. It was not so, however. For
                the roots of the great tree ran out in all directions, and it required a
                considerable degree of activity to pass them without stumbling, and such an accident
                might have been attended with unpleasant consequences. Besides, as it has been inti.
                mated, the reporter was quite fat and large, and it was requi-' site to use every
                precaution to keep his body covered by the' trunk of the tree, for the colonel was a
                famous shot. The re- porter therefore was compelled to maintain nearly a horizontal
                position, with his eye upon the colonel'a heel, and his face out of the pistol's
                range; and his motioitwas required to be regular and incessant, so as not to leave
                his rear uncovered. They continued to wind round the tree in this manner until the
                sun had risen. Neither of them now were conscious of the frosty atmosphere. The
                reporter panted, and his smoking breath was expelled in great clouds. The colonel
                turned red in the temples and behind the ears. Evidently the contest was approaching
                a termination, although no blood had yet been spilled. At length a small part of the
                reporter's coat tail, which the colonel had hitherto seen but once or twice, became
                steadily visible, and seemed to grow larger. The colonel fired, and a button fell.
                He then paused, and placing the pistol under the stump of his amputated arm, very
                deliberately began to re-charge it. " Now I have you ! " cried the reporter, seizing
                the other pistol, which still lay near the root of the tree, and advancing a pace or
                two towards his antagonist. " It is my turn, now! " he continued, levelling the
                weapon. ahd aiming at the colonel's breast. "Fire away I " said the colonel. " The
                next shot is yours, THE REPORTER MAGNANIMOUS. 321 by all the rules. But if you hit
                the mark, be sure and report it correctly. Remember that. And be quick about it or I
                shall soon be ready for another chance." The reporter, seeing that the colonel was
                ramming down another bullet, and believing the matter, if carried any further, might
                not result without injury, fired his pistol in the air, and advanced with his hand
                extended, which the colonel could not avoid receiving. "Very well!" said the
                colonel; "I cannot decline your hand after sparing my life. We will return and drink
                a bottle together. But be sure and show me your notes before you go to press." The
                reporter repeated the assurance that he would do so and also pledged himself never
                again to volunteer his services on a similar occasion. After a hearty breakfast with
                the reporter, at one of the restaurants, the colonel sought his principal at the
                office of the --, where he was known to have been employed in the capacity of an
                assistant editor. He was not at the office; but the chief editor was there, and with
                whom the colonel was very well acquainted. "I am here to see Mr. Pollen," said the
                colonel. "I am sorry he is not in, colonel," said the editor. So am I. But perhaps
                you will indorse him." "I suppose so. I see whatever he writes before it is printed,
                and I must be responsible for it." "I don't mean that!" said the colonel. "Oh, I
                think I know what you mean. His debts! I pay him a salary, which he disburses as he
                pleases, and I cannot assume his liabilities." "I don't mean that, either," said the
                colonel. "I was his friend, and arranged a hostile meeting for him. He was not
                present at the time and place appointed, and he must answer it!" "Is it possible?
                Why Pollen, surely, never challenged any one to mortal combat! I am astonished to
                hear you say so, colonel. But if he did-that is, if there has been no mis-
                understanding on your part-rely upon it, he is innocent of any intention to practise
                the deception you complain of. You may be assured the whole matter escaped his
                memory; and en to one, if he were to-day to meet the person who insulted him, he

                " No; it was some disparagement of a young lady he at. tended at Mrs. Laurel's
                party." Ha, ha, ha! Pollen fighting about a young lady! The whole thing is a
                misconstruction, colonel. Pollen never takes any interest in the ladies. I suppose
                he would not permit any one under his charge to be insulted, but he would not
                seriously challenge a man to mortal combat for words lightly spoken. Come with me.

                ROMANTIC RECONCILIATION OF THE LOVERS. ALTHOUGH Lucy was sensible of a painful
                dejection following the events in the saloons of Mrs. Laurel, yet her forebodings
                were not unmixed with a melancholy pleasure, when she re- membered the pleading
                looks and eloquent words of her lover. Filial duty, interest, even a prior
                engagement, might separate them in future; but there could be no doubt he truly
                loved her-that no one else could ever inspire a more ardent affec- tion in his
                breast than she had done. He might go beyond the broad ocean, never to return; he
                might glitter as an orna- ment in the lofty circles of the aristocracy, to which he
                be- longed; and he might have in his train the high-born Lady Stuart, and be the
                lord of her vast possessions; yet, something within assured Lucy he could never
                forget her-he could never cease to dwell upon her memory with sad regret. And,
                however singular it may appear to the uninitiated, yet such refections, even when
                the object which inspires them is lost beyond the hope of recovery, are fraught with
                soothing consolations, more potent in enabling the sex to bear the most dreadful of
                all deprivations, than any other equiva' lents the world can offer. It is the
                conviction that they have been appreciated, though not possessed; the knowledge that
                their loss will be lamented, after they have been cast away. Such is woman! , Lucy
                never slept more sweetly, nor dreamt more delight- fully, than on the night she
                returned from the Laurel man- sion. And the next morning she arose quite refreshed,
                with cheeks nearly as roseate as usual, and with spirits no longer desponding; for
                she knew that if it was the decree of fortune she should be separated from her
                exalted lover-but whom she was proud to have loved as the untitled Mr. Lowe-the pang
                of parting must be reciprocal. "I hope you are better this morning, dear aunt," said
                Lucy, the next day, when she entered Miss Flora's chamber. A great deal. The doctor
                understands my system, and his remedies never fail. You must send for Dr. M3cGab---
                but, really, Lucy !H" continued her aunt, gazing at her niece, "you look as well as
                ever you did." "I am quite well this morning, aunt." " I was fearful the excitement
                last night would unstring your nerves. They must be better than mine. You are
                stronger than I was at your age. But tell me the news. Was Roland there ?" "He was."
                " How did Pollen conduct himself? " " He is now the favorite of the countess, and
                you must not expect him longer to dance attendance here." I am sure it was only pity
                for his distresses that I felt for him. If there is to be no more distress, there
                need be no more pity. But instead of using the money I gave him in the way he
                promised, I learn from his tailor he paid it to him, and the bill is not yet quite
                settled in full. I will pay. it, however. How did the countess look ?" "Fresh and
                blooming as yourself, dear aunt." As myself! But they say there is really some
                resem- blance between us. And the earl ?" " You mean Mr. Lowe ? " "No-the Lord
                Hilton." ' You know him very well; the earl was Mr. Lowe. You have often entertained
                his lordship under your rof." Lucy! is that so?" exclaimed Flora, with much ani.
                mation. "It is, indeed, aunt; and for several days I had suspected as much." <pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6922-00000168"/>

                girl! But I hope the difference is not irrecon- cilable. Yet you did well. A too
                easy yielding often ruins a girl's power over the sterner sex. The gratification of
                re. pulsing a lord, must be nearly as great as marrying one! The greatest triumph I
                ever enjoyed, was the rejection of---; who, you know, became an ambassador. But I
                knew he merely wanted my little fortune. Lord Hilton! And he won your little heart
                as the simple Mr. Lowe!" "I fancy, aunt," replied Lucy, " he lost quite as much as
                he won!" "Oh, it is a game at which two can play! Such a ro- mance! I had a
                presentiment of something of the sort, when I received your letter from Babbleton. I
                am perfectly well, Lucy. Some one rings. How late it is. I will be down in a few
                minutes. Who is it?" she continued, to the servant. "A note? For you, Lucy. Read
                it." It was from Lord Hilton, urgently begging a brief inter- view on a matter of
                the utmost importance. But the signa. ture was "Edmund." "I think I would deny him,
                Lucy," said Miss Flora. "It will increase his eagerness. Never fear but he will
                persist until he accomplishes his purpose. I know the men!" And yet she never
                secured one herself, with all her knowledge. Whether or not that fact had any
                influence in the decision of Lucy, she told the servant to say she would attend the
                gen- tleman. A few minutes after, Lucy entered the parlor. She was struck with the
                mournful expression of Lord Hilton's counte- nance, and immediately changed her
                purpose of maintaining a cold and resentful demeanor. t"Lucy," said he, taking her
                unresisting hand, and leading her t a seat, "I beg you will hear me patiently before
                you reply. It is my duty to ask forgiveness, and to utter expla- nations. All I
                crave is to be heard, and to be judged accord- :ing to the dictates of your heart."
                IEXPLANATIONS. 325 "Go on, sir, if you please. But there is nothing to forgive. I
                have not censured you." "But I was not so forbearing. It was my duty to ascer- tain,
                beyond the possibility of doubt, and by other means than those at first adopted, if
                there were any just grounds for the suspicion-and it pains me to repeat it-that I
                was made the victim of a duplicity, a capricious deception-so inconsistent with your
                nature-so different from all the former actions of your life---" "You will oblige
                me," said Lucy, "by putting a period to these self-reproaches." "They are merited;
                for my obtuseness and stupidity were unparalleled. I should have known, after the
                vile attempt of Roland on that memorable night, that he was capable of any
                device-apt to perpetrate any scheme, to destroy the character of the one who
                indignantly rejected his offers; or to be insidi- ously revenged on the one who had
                defied his prowess in open day." 'Do you know it now?" asked Lucy. "I do. And I
                came- hither to relate the manner of the discovery." He then described the
                occurrence of the pre- ceding evening, and told her he had employed similar agents
                to those which had been used by Roland, to watch his move- ments, and to obtain
                information from the villain's creatures. Lucy, though surprised, betrayed no
                emotion. Conscious of her own rectitude, she never yielded to the apprehension that
                she might be seriously involved in the machinations of others. "And now," continued
                his lordship, "can you forgive me?" "Most certainly," said Lucy. "Be assured that I

                I am forgiven. Why, then, should you desire to avoid the consummation of the promise
                you made me? Why seek to be estranged from the one, who, enveloped in mystery, you
                admitted had some shqe in your affections-and who now declares, when the cloud of
                uncertainty is dispelled, that his whole heart is yours, and that his happiness in
                this world depends upon an indissoluble union with you. You knew IP was a native of
                a distant ltnd, and that I never sought to become a citizen of yaor country. That

                admitted when I did not know the rank you were destined to hold, is not
                diminished----" "Noble, generous Lucy!" exclaimed he, pressing her to his heart.
                "Have pity, Edmund," said she, escaping from him, and resuming her chair. "Let us
                realize the thought, that in all probability we are doomed soon to part -probably to
                meet no more." , "No.! no! The power does not exist which can sepa- rate us,"
                "Reason will resume its sway. I have learned from others-and without a resort to
                interrogation-that another claims you--a relation of your own, and in your own
                country. One who is able to repair the injury wrought on your heredi- tary
                possessions by the improvidence of the late earl-----and one who has the approbation
                of the countess-- "Lucy! Let me explain it. It is true my mother would have me
                espouse the Lady Stuart. But, even if I had never met with you, I would not comply
                with my mother's wishes. Our estates are contiguous, but our hearts are wide
                asunder. And Lady Stuart is my senior in years, and would not deny that her heart
                has been lavished on another. Enough of her. But ave letters from my steward,
                stating that the heaviest claims against my deceased brother's estate, and which I
                had agreed to discharge, have been ascertained to be fraudulent, and there is no
                obligation, legal or moral, to pay them. My clear rental will be amply sufficient

                one who has studied so many lessons of economy in this great country- and if enough
                for your comfort and elegance, you alone, would suffice for my happiness." "This is
                rhapsody-reality must follow. The wife of Lord Hilton should be of noble descent, or
                else she should not dwell in a land of hereditary titles." "Not so. In England the
                wife shares the husband's sta- tion, and is elevated to his rank by law and custom.
                In America the lord becomes a citizen. Such is the operation of both governments.

                with me, my adorable girl? Let your brother exult in his native Americanism. He is
                right. Were I not debarred by birth, I would be of his party. Nor would I deprive
                his country of a vote or a soldier. But politics, in your glorious Re- public,
                cannot be made to mingle with matrimony. If your foreign husband dwelt in America,
                it might be different-it might seem like a proscription of the natives. But who
                would censure your brother if he were to wed a foreign lady? She could exercise no

                objection.! Forgive me; but I apprehend some obstacles from your brother." "-My
                brother knows my utter aversion to politics," con- tinued Lucy, "and will not be
                likely to attempt an inter- ference on such grounds. But, still, there would be
                difficulties. My mother - ' "Shall go with us." "She would not leave her old mansion

                institutions. And when I return to my place in the House of Lords, I will be the
                better able to repel the calumnies of our slanderous scribblers. For the last few
                centuries Great Britain has culminated above all the empires that preceded her; but
                she is, I think, to be succeed- ed and surpassed by her Transatlantic offspring. But
                Americans must rule America, as the British have ruled Great Britain. ' "Are you not
                talking politics again? ' asked Lucy, archly. <pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC6922-00000170"/> 328 THE WINKLES. "Perhaps you
                would demonstrate the point that a British lord might, however, govern an American
                lady?" "By no means!" said his lordship, taking her unresisting hand-" for a lady
                governs all the lords of Great Britain." The conversation was interrupted by the
                entrance of Miss Flora Blount, radiant with smiles. "I have learned all about your
                romantic disguises," said she. "Not all of them, aunt," said Lucy. She then related
                the account of the chastisement of Rolarrd by the countess's coachman and footman.
                "That was well done," said Flora, "and the punishment merited." She then launched on
                the ocean of romance, enu- merating many instances of lords dwelling in foreign
                lands, under assumed names, and concluded by intimating to Lord Hilton that she
                should not be surprised if he were to be made one of the heroes of a novel. His
                lordship admitted the possibility of such a thing; and said he ought not be
                astonished at it, inasmuch as the affair of the disguised footman and coachman with
                Roland had been faithfully chronicled. He then exhibited a morning paper containing
                an elaborate version of the occurrence; and while Miss Blount was striving to read
                it without her specta. cles, and entirely unconscious of the fact, that the sheet
                was upside down in her hands, his lordship bowed, and withdrew with an elastic step
                and happy countenance. During the day, the countess and Mrs. Laurel called to
                inquire after the health of Miss Blount; and both were ex- ceedingly complimentary
                on the improved appearance of Lucy, who had been less vivacious than usual the
                evening before. She did not explain the cause of the change-but from certain phrases
                made use of by the visitors, it might have been inferred-and which was really the
                case-that Lord Hilton had communicated something of a peremptory character to his
                mother. The ladies had just risen to depart when Col. Ball-was announced. When the
                door closed after them, the colonel said his object was to ascertain the place where
                he would be likely to meet the poet. "Bless your life, colonel," said Miss Flora, "I
                was about to ask you the same question. Until to-day, I could always A MLITARY
                SUITOR. 329 rely upon seeing him here. But the countess has captured him, and I must
                relinquish my claims." "He was not worth retaining, madam," said the colonel. He
                then detailed the inexcusable pusillanimity of his conduct, and gave the particulars
                of his wild-goose chase, as he called it, to Hoboken; and amused Lucy with his
                description of the encounter with the reporter. "And it was all on your account,
                miss." added the colonel. "I am much indebted to you, colonel." "That's nothing. I
                am indebted to at least fifty. But those pranksome girls-the Babbleton heiresses at
                our board- ing house-have been telling me that this sprig of nobility- his father
                was a brave man, and was killed magnificently in battle-this son of the laughing
                countess, has been stealing away the hearts of our American girls, and that, too,
                under false colors." "Did they tell you that?" "Something of the sort. But they have
                changed their tune since Roland had his .drubbing, which I will tell you about
                another time, and they declare you are worthy of a prince." "I am much obliged to
                them." "I doubt it. They regret, I am sure, the Earl did not lay siege to their own
                slightly defended hearts--or that they did not ambush for his." "That is unkind,
                colonel." "No. It is the truth. But, since I was the friend of your craven protector
                last night, and was ready to stand in his place this morning; and since this
                disguised stranger turns out to be a great lord, who will no doubt desert you-hang
                me, if an old soldier can avail any thing, and you will accept his remaining
                hand----" "Colonel Ball! What are you driving at?' "What am I driving at? I am
                aiming point-blank at matrimony, rather than see such a splendid girl go unwedded.
                What say you to my summons?" "I must decline-but I thank you." "If you decline, I
                will not attempt a storm-or tempt one, rather; for if you were to comply, I should
                be the prisoner. Well, I have discharged my duty, both here and in the field.
                Farewell." And before the ladies had time to perceive that the old warrior was quite
                serious in his proposition, he had '- <pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC6922-00000171"/> 33C THE WINKLES. vanished. But,
                nevertheless, their laughter could *not be re- strained. The Blount mansion now
                became a very fashionable resort. The old walls, ceilings, fireplaces, and furniture
                were tolerated without a depreciating comment, after it was ascertained that the
                earl and the countess were frequent visitors; and that Mrs. Laurel had substituted
                wax candles in her parlors, for jets of gas. Roland had left the city in
                discomfiture and disgrace, and his blue carriage no longer impudently waited to
                entrap his victims. Even Bell Arum and Susan Crudle, wrote polite notes to Lucy
                Winkle, protesting that they had been misled and deceived by the wicked
                misrepresentations of Roland, and beseeching their old schoolmate and neighbor to
                forgive them. Lucy did so without hesitation, and invited them to her aunt's
                mansion. It was a most unaccountable thing to Lucy that' they had escaped the evil
                devices of Roland; or rather that he formed no designs against them. But they had
                never en- tertained any apprehensions; and if he had proposed matri- mony, they were
                both in readiness to accept him. Admitted to the Blount mansion, Bell and Susan
                immedi- ately cut the acquaintance of their boarding-house associates. The music
                teacher, the dry goods clerk, and the horticulturist were dismissed. Henceforth
                their company was to be com- prised of the real aristocracy. And by some means which
                was never explained, George Parke had obtained an intimation that his presence in
                the city would be agreeable to certain young ladies at No. -, - square; and as it
                was vacation, he repaired thither, and became an occasional attendant at the various
                places of amusement. Poor fellow I He too had in- tended to propose to Lucy, when
                informed by Miss Crudle that she was already engaged. But as he really admired her,
                he found some satisfaction in occasionally gaining access to her presence in company
                with the belles, for whom he found it impossible to entertain any other than
                feelings of friendly in- difference. From New York he ultimately wandered over to
                Philadelphia, where he became seriously fascinated with Julia Nitre. Lord Hilton
                having resisted the entreaties of his mother in behalf of Lady Stuart, their
                departure from the United States was indefinitely postponed. They were the objects

                331 aristocracy of the great metropolis, that they were induced to pass the winter
                among them. About this time all Babbleton was in a state of excessive agitation.
                Bell and Sue were writing home lengthy letters every day. Lucy Winkle was to be
                married to an earl! The countess, his mother, would certainly be in Babbleton-and
                they would all be the guests of the Widow Winkle! No doubt the money with which the
                widow's house had been pur- chased, was furnished by his lordship! The widow's house
                was now beset with friendly visitors, whilst Mrs. Griselda ceased to be tolerated by
                the quality of the village. And in revenge for this she staid at home and tormented
                her prisoner. But Patty O'Pan appeared no more in her Arum and Crudle costume, and
                her offence was forgotten. CHAPTER XXIX. WALTER GOES TO
                WASHNGTON-OFFICE-HUNTINGTPPNG. WHEN Walter had taken leave of his-Aunt Wilsome,
                carelessly placing the check she gave him in an outside pocket of his overcoat, he
                hastened to the hotel to join Mr. Plastic the member of Congress from his district,
                with whom he was to proceed to Washington. Mr. Plastic, like many other members
                newly elected, or just re-elected, without having been blessed with an inordi- nate
                share of intellect, and without having acquired a greater amount of information than
                a majority of his contemporaries, was nevertheless oppressed with a superabundance
                of vanity, and was known by his most intimate acquaintances to be an egregious
                egotist. But among strangers, in the reading rooms and parlors of the hotels, he
                could pass for a great man; and he was gratified to overhear the waiters and porters
                say, "he's a member of Congress;" and to observe the guests turn and look at him, as
                he promenaded between the bar and the hall door. Without any other qualifications
                than an exceedingly numerous and influential connection, and a vast amount of
                wealth, Mr. Plastic had been lifted from obscurity by Walter's father, and by his
                means was nominated and elected to the <pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC6922-00000172"/> 332 THE WINKLES. legislature;
                and after Mr. Winkle's death he had succeeeded him in Congress. "Well, Mr. Plastic,"
                said Walter, when they were seated in the car, "I suppose my case will soon be
                decided. I am a novice, however, and it may be well to have an interview with Mrs.
                Honoria F., before we proceed farther." "Leave it to me. I will see the President
                immediately after our arrival. Mrs. Fimble, I know, has some influence." "And that
                may be obtained, I suppose?" ": You are a wild fellow! But take care you do not let
                any of your light remarks reach her ears. In Washington every word spoken is heard,
                and if it can be used to injure any one it will be repeated. Mrs. F. is thought to
                be poten. tial at Washington, both in the executive departments, and in the lobbies,
                library, and committee rooms of the capitol.. But the President will see me. I have
                been freshy indorsed by my people, and he will congratulate me on my victory over
                Roland. We must speak lower. They are staring at me." At the mention of his triumph
                over Roland, a tall, gray- haired gentleman sitting in front, turned round and bowed
                to Plastic. "How do you do, Mr. Bell? I am glad to see you, sir," said Plastic. "I
                have been delayed in making my appearance at the capitol by illness in my family.
                But I see they have put me at the head of a committee." "I see they have," said Mr.
                Bell. "The committee on ") Plastic's voice had been sufficiently loud to attract
                gen- eral attention. But Mr. Bell's announcement had produced quite a commotion; for
                a majority of the male passengers were either office-seekers, or the prosecutors of
                claims before Congress. Walter was surprised at the sensation exhibited in front and
                on either side of him. He then turned his head to see what had been the effect in
                the rear. Immediately behind him sat a jovial Irishman, who gave him a wink, and an
                intelli- gent smile, which, however, Walter wag unable at first to com- prehend. But
                after some reflection, and a few more exchanges of glances, he recollected having
                seen the man before, and bowed to him. "I think we have met somewhere," said Walter.
                "You may say that, Mr. Winkle, and tell the truth.' THE TWO OFFICE-SEEKERS. 333
                "Where it was, or when, I confess I do not remember. But as you seem to know my
                name, perhaps you will tell me yours." "Patrick MeClusky," said the other, in a low
                voice. "Oh. I recollect, now," said Walter, in a whisper. Patrick was one of the
                prisoners at the station on the night of Walter's capture at Professor Point's. He
                was the keeper of an oyster house, and had somehow got mixed up in a row at the bar,
                where some one had condemned his brandy. Walter only re- collected his name, but
                could easily recognize his voice, for he had often heard him, at his bar, cry out,
                "By, stew I " "mint julep," &amp;c. "See Mrs. Famble," said Patrick, " that's what I
                would recommind to ye." "And where are you going, Patrick?" "Afther an office, too.
                I want an inspectorship. But I nadn't see the Prisident, nor the Secretary nader.
                Masthress Honoria Famble will fax my business." He added in a low whisper-"I'm going
                to pay her a faa of fafty dollars for her sarvices." "And this young gentleman,"
                said Mr. Bell, addressing himself indirectly to Walter, "you say is the son of my
                old friend Winkle? Sir," he continued, shaking Walter's hand, "your father was one
                of the most independent men in Con- gress. I knew him well, and loved him. And I am
                sorry to learn his affairs fell into such embarrassment. that his son is under the
                necessity of taking so desperate a step as to become an office-seeker." "hope, sir,"
                said Walter, "the step will not be so dis- agreeable. If I am not mistaken, you have
                recently received an appointment." "Very true. My fortune having been ruined by one
                I confided in, my friends demanded an office for me. The Pre- sident very kindly
                acceded to the request, and my name was sent into the Senate, and there it
                remains-and I fear it will remain, unless I can satisfactorily divide some forty
                minor salaries within my gift among the five hundred friends of the Senators. It is
                a problem I fear which cannot be solved-a price I cannot pay for the office. I
                regret that my friends proposed my name; but having been nominated, I must defend my
                character," - "Defend your character, Mr. Bell?" exclaimed Walter, <pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC6922-00000173"/>

                lightest acts, will be-remembered. But these will be the least of your torments. A

                it!" M "If you lose your temper you are lost. No. Follow my example. Get some friend
                to furnish a list of the charges- and then refute them. Leave the rest to
                Providence. If you be rejected, with your character saved, retire from the field,
                and congratulate yourself on so fortunate an escape." "Go to Misthress Famble,"
                whispered Patrick. "Might I not succeed," asked Walter, "by securing the services of
                Mrs. Fimble?" "Yes-by conciliating her, you might succeed-but it would be at the
                expense of your honor. I am determined to defy her opposition, since I learn she
                opposed my appoint- ment." Mr. Bell said this with a quivering lip, and then turned
                away his face. When they reached Washington, Walter put up at one of the principal
                hotels, where his friend Plastic had previously engaged a suite of rooms, in
                conjunction with several of the members from his State. Walter and Mr. Bell obtained
                lodg- ings in the same room. Mr. Bell threw out several hints to his young and
                inexperienced friend, in regard to the expense of living in Washington, and
                particularly at the hotels. But Walter, not doubting his appointment would soon be
                procured through the influence of Plastic, had no apprehensions that his finances
                would be exhausted before he could replenish them from the public treasury. "Be not
                too sure of that," said his aged friend. "You may have to dance attendance here for
                many months. Your friend Plastic is not omnipotent. His influence is not so great as
                he supposes. It is true he has a vote, and that the adminis- PATRICK'S LETTER TO
                WINKLE. 335 tration will wish to secure-but he is a weak man. My advice is, that you
                look for cheap lodgings, and count your money." This conversation took place just
                before the hour of retir- ing on the evening of their arrival; and Walter
                involuntarily drew out his purse and reckoned his gold on the small table before the
                fire. "Here are one hundred and ten dollars," said he, in gold. That is my whole
                fortune. No!" he continued, starting up, and searching the pockets of his overcoat.
                "My aunt Winkle gave me a check, which I placed among my letters. Here are the
                letters, but I don't see the check." "I remember seeing your papers scattered about
                on the floor of the car," said Mr. Bell. "I hope your check did not fall with them."
                "It must have been so. Patrick handed them to me. I hope he didn't keep my check."
                "Patrick? What Patrick?" "Patrick McClusky." = "A great scamp! he is one of my
                enemies. He applied to me for a clerkship-or rather demanded it in an epistle which
                I could scarcely read; the grammar, orthography and chirography all being
                detestable. I wrote him back that my subordinates must at least be capable of
                discharging the duties assigned them, which he could never do, judging from the
                epistolary specimen before me. The rascal then sent me an impudent reply, saying he
                would apply to my batters.' No doubt he stole your check. For what amount was it?" '
                Upon my word I don't know, I did not look at it." "Then you can't tell where it was
                payable, or whether it was drawn to order or bearer. Write immediately to your aunt,
                and have the payment stopped. But what's that?" A servant entered bearing a clumsily
                folded letter super- scribed: "Tow Mr. Walther Wankle Esqr." "It must be for me,"
                said Walter. "Put it on the table. Iwill look at it when I have searched my pockets
                once more." Not finding the check, he opened the letter and read as follows:
                "Misther Walther Wankle, Sir - I have sane Misthress Famble and mi busnes is faxd.

                "From the looks of his handwriting," -aid Walter, 'he would hardly be able to make a
                fortune by forging other people's names. But here's a postscript." He then read
                aloud the following: '?s misthress famble ses thae bell hung up in the senat won't

                Fimble, at all events," said Mr. Bell. "Is it true she has such influence?" asked
                Walter. "It may be so. It is strongly suspected. Her husband and herself-it is said
                they are man and wife, but no one ever heard of them before they came here-live in
                the most ex- pensive manner, and by some means they have an abundance of money, and
                find access to all the functionaries of the government. It is a mystery. He is a
                handsome man, his face exhibiting all the evidences of luxurious living, and she is
                certainly one of the most beautiful women I ever beheld. They sat nearly opposite at
                the table " "Was that Mrs. Fimble?" asked Walter, with much interest. "It was. And
                the Irishman, I doubt not, reported her words correctly, although his pen has given
                them a different pronunciation. She is not only handsome, as you are ready to admit,
                but she is accomplished in intrigue, and really charms many of the old senators by
                the fascinations of her conversation." "Was not that the senator from - at her
                side?" "It was. And because I did not speak to the lady, she may compel him to vote
                against me. I care not. But I warn you against the Fimbles, unless you are prepared
                to pay them tribute." "From what McClusky says, it would seem the lady is favorably
                disposed towards'me." "Beware of her! She might, however, if she were to en- tertain
                a partiality for you-,and I should not be surprised at it, seeing your form and
                address--facilitate your object. But AN INTERVIEW WITH THE PRESIDENT. 337 then, I
                doubt if you would choose to be indebted to any pet- ticoat influence for your
                office." Walter admitted that he would prefer to be appointed on the ground of his
                own merit. Nevertheless, he would not banish from his memory the image of the
                beautiful creature he had seen at the supper-table. And he retired to his couch
                without either writing to his aunt or answering Paddy's letter. The next day Mr.
                Plastic accompanied Walter to the White House. The M. C. from -- obtained admittance
                without difficulty. He scarcely deigned to bestow a passing glance on the
                doorkeeper, that great personage whose favor- able attention so many others strove
                in vain to win. Plastic approached the President with the utmost famili- arity and
                confidence, and presented his young friend almost in tones of exultation. "I am glad
                to see you, gentlemen," said the President. "Sit down. Winkle? Did you say Winkle?"
                "Yes, sir," said Plastic, while Walter was amused at the President's seeming
                sincerity of manner. 'Why, sir," said the President, addressing the young man, 'I
                knew your father well. He was my friend. A brave and honorable gentleman. It gives
                me pleasure to meet the son of one I esteemed so highly; a son, no doubt, worthy of
                so true a sire." "I have no doubt," said Plastic, "you read my young friend's speech
                at Babbleton. It was terse, concentrated, original, and effective. It contributed
                much to secure my election." "Oh, certainly! I recollect it distinctly. We had it
                before the cabinet, and it was pronounced the boldest and best thing that had
                occurred during the canvass. My young friend, the administration is much indebted to
                you; and it will afford me pleasure to serve you in any way in my power " Walter
                bowed, thinking such a gesture could never be more appropriate than just at that
                time. "That is coming to the point, Mr. President," said Plas- ti. "My young friend
                desires to visit England; and Col. Oakdale, who you know will certainly be chosen
                senator by the Legislature now in session, and myself, have agreed to unite in
                asking for him the office of Secretary of Legation, or Consul at London." 15 <pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC6922-00000175"/>
                338 THE WINKLES. Well-let me see-I do not know that they have been irrevocably
                promised to others; and I am sure no one can produce better claims. Col. Oakdale and
                yourself are en. titled to demand something for your friend; and, besides, my young
                friend has claims of his own, both on account of his father's services and his own
                merits." "I am sure, sir," said Walter "I am deeply indebted to you for your kind
                expressions.' Kind expressions merely, my friend," said the President, "are not
                deemed of much value here,--eh, Plastic?" "No, indeed," said Plastic. "They are as
                plenty as blackberries, and as cheap as Potomac herrings. You will be overwhelmed
                with them in this city, and might starve on them, if the President were not truly
                your friend." "True, Plastic," said his excellency. "But I will be his friend, both
                on account of his father's services and his own claims." He then wrote the following
                familiar note to the Secretary of State-"Mr. Walter Winkle, the son of an old friend
                from - , is an applicant for the office of Secretary of Legation in London. I wish
                him to have the appoint. ment; or else the Consulate at the same place. Let me know
                immediately which would be the most agreeable and advan. tageous position; and which
                has the fewest obstacles in the way." Walter ran his eye over the note while the
                President and Plastic were discussing some point of policy in reference to the
                business before the House of Representatives. Although he was not sure that he
                comprehended the last line, yet he supposed the note upon the whole very
                satisfactory. The interview with the President being ended, Walter and his friend
                proceeded next to the Department of State. After some little delay, just sufficient
                to indicate the impor. tance of the chief diplomatic functionary, they were
                admitted. The eyes of the secretary dilated when, after the ceremony of introduction
                they fell upon the Presidential seal of the note produced by the young man; and his
                brows were slightly contracted when he perused the lines. It was one of those cases
                in which the usual preliminary consultation had not been had with the head of the
                department-in which, indeed, a stride had been made over the secretary by the
                applicant and his friend. They had, nevertheless, been sent down to him by the
                President himself, and the parties were to be convinced mat THE SECRETARY OF STATE.
                339 ters of that nature and magnitude could not be accomplished without his
                participation in the work. After a silence of several minutes, the secretary
                remarked that the President's request should be complied with; and Walter uttered a
                profusion of acknowledgments. "It will certainly be a pleasure for me to remove any
                of the obstacles the President alludes to," said the secretary, and then added,' "if
                it be in my power to do so." "I understand," said the young man, " that both places
                are vacant, or will soon be so." "That is very true. But the obstacles do not lie in
                that direction. There is never any difficulty in finding or maring vacancies. One
                half of our agents abroad are utterly incom- petent, and the other moiety are
                unfaithful, so that there are always a sufficient number ripe for removal. The
                difficulty is in deciding who shall succeed them. Among the many appli- cants, it is
                a very embarrassing operation to determine whose claims are the strongest." I
                hoped," said Walter, " there were but few if any appli- cations, as yet, for either
                of the positions. The President did not intimate there were any." "He did not
                mention them, but the obstacles he refers to relate to other applicants. Mr.
                Boozle," said the minister, addressing his private secretary in the next room, " let
                me see the number of applications for the two vacant places in-Lon- don." A moment
                after Mr. Boozle came in, preceded by a mes- senger bearing a large basket filled
                with bundles of papers. "I did not desire to know how many bushels," said the great
                diplomatic functionary, "but the number." "These are the applications for the
                consulate," said Boo- zle. "They number seven hundred. There are two baskets for the
                other, numbering a thousand." "That is all, Boozle?" said the minister, smiling at
                the dismay of Walter. "But;" said Plastic with an air of importance, and recol-
                lecting that he had been requested by the President to oppose a motion in the House
                for the production of a certain diplo- matic correspondence, which it was understood
                the secretary was averse to having made public, "I presume the claims of my friend
                cannot be inferior to any." "Unquestionably not! It is true there are among the ap-

                and, indeeda near relative of the present incumbent, and many sons and nephews of
                ex-secretaries and senators. But you know our organ has condemned nepotism, and
                therefore we are commit. ted against it. Besides, we are quite secure in the Senate
                while the majority in the House is less reliable. I was aston. ished to see the
                motion entertained for the production of the Algerine correspondence." "Oh, we'll
                vote it down to-day. And I must hasten to the capitol. I hope, Mr. Secretary, there
                will be no delay in this business of my young friend." "I think not. I will
                immediately send the information required to the President. I shall be happy to see
                you again to-morrow, Mr. Winkle." Plastic and Walter withdrew; but before they left
                the building, the former was called aside by Mr. Boozle, who de. sired a few
                moments' conversation in private. When the member rejoined his young friend, it was
                with a troubled countenance, real or, affected. "Such profligacy!" said he; " such
                monstrous corruption, was never heard of be. fore, and surely never existed in any
                other government." "It is some state secret, I suppose," said Walter, "which none
                but officials should know." "None but rogues, it seems to me," said Plastic. "I will
                tell you in the strictest confidence," he continued, as they walked along. "Boozle
                assures me that both places have been already promised to the proteges of two
                members." "By the President?" "I suppose so-certainly by the secretary. They must
                have forgotten it in the multiplicity of their engagements." "I have read
                somewhere," said Walter, "that great public functionaries possess the faculty of
                forgetfulness. I hope this Mr. Boozle will not take it upon himself to remind them
                of their former promises; and I will dance attendance upon them so incessantly they
                shall not be able to forget their pledges to me. And I had better tip this private
                secretary in the manner described by Gil Blas, when he was confidential secretary of
                the Spanish minister. But I have not the means. I might, however, make him a promise
                you know." "You have read to some purpose, Walter, and I think you will have the
                address to carry your point. But the matter THE WAY APPOINTMENTS ARE OBTAINED. 341
                stands thus: The members referred to make politics a trade. You understand?"
                "Perfectly, I think. They are likewise to be tipped. But where would be the
                incumbent's compensation." "The consulship is worth $5,000 per annum, with the
                perquisites, which can be realized by good management." "Well. The two members
                conciliated, how shall we dis- pose of the two proteges? Tip them too?" "Only one of
                them can be disappointed, you know." "Exactly, I cannot have both offices. And
                therefore but one of the members will have to be tipped, unless you take----" "Me?
                Don't suppose any thing of the kind! I should be offended if I thought you capable
                of conceiving such an idea. But the applicants who have obtained the promises had
                agreed to pay the members ten per cent. of their salaries, fees and perquisites; and
                I understand they have already advanced cer- tain sums. The member who will have to
                relinquish the ap- pointment procured for his friend, will have to refund, and that
                would be inconvenient." "Unless I reimbursed the amount." "Precisely so. Are you
                prepared to do it?" "But the one that had the promise? How will they dis- pose of
                him?" "Boozle. says that can be managed. A previous promise to you, which had been
                forgotten. Something of that sort. But are you prepared to furnish Boozle the means
                to tip the member?" "Will he furnish me the name of the member, so that I can treat
                with him directly?" "I think not." "Do you know his name?" "Yes-but I am bound in
                honor not to divulge it." "Will you not see him for me, so there can be no necessity
                for the interposition of Boozle? '? "Yes. I will undertake to pay him the amount you
                send." "I shall send him nothing." "What do you mean, then?" "To punish him. "Punish
                him?" "Yes. He's a scoundrel, and you must tell me his name." "I shall do no such
                thing " Then I will hold you responsible. Good day, sir! The <pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC6922-00000177"/> 342 THE WINKLES.
                only way in which I can be conciliated will be the immediat notification of my
                appointment. You can now test the extent of your influence." And Walter turned away
                from the astonished member boiling with indignation and anger, and resolved at the
                instant to make a public exposure of the corrupt practices of the trad. ing
                politicians. But before he' reached his lodgings he had time to reflect that the
                revelation had been confidentially made, and that it would be out of his power to
                avail himself of it in the manner he at first intended. In the afternoon, as Walter
                was sitting in his room pon- dering over the events of the morning, he was startled
                by the abrupt entrance of Mr. Bell, who held in his hand a large en. velope, bearing
                the broad sealLof the government. "I hope you have your commission, sir," said
                Walter. Yes-you may congratulate me on my victory," said Mr. Bell; " but I had hard
                fighting for it. I preferred a final de. cision to further delay. This is the tenth
                time I have been to Washington on this business, and I resolved it should be the
                last. They confirmed me by a majority of one, and that result was obtained by
                stratagem." "Stratagem?" "I had to enter the lists against Mrs. Fimble and I out.
                generalled her. My friend from Virginia conceived the idea, and I acted by his
                advice. When the Senate was about to go into executive session, we contrived to have
                an album sent to Mr. - - for his autograph. He was told it was for Mrs. Fimble, who
                was about to leave the city. He wrote his name, in the book, and then followed the
                boy, who soon eluded him. Now Mr. ,like many others, had been fascinated by the
                beauty of Mrs. F., and the charms of her conversation. Although quite seventy years
                old, Mr. - took such de- light in conducting the young lady to the levees and
                soirees, and along the avenue, that he could not bear the thought of being deprived
                of that pleasure so abruptly, and so he resolved to seek an interview, and know the
                reason why she was de. parting so unceremoniously. He found her here in her suite of
                apartments, surrounded by the wives and daughters of the functionaries of the
                government, and I need not tell you their surprise was mutual, when the object of
                his visit had been ex- plained, which did not occur for more than an hour. He has-
                tened back to the capitol, but the Senate had adjourned just WINKLE'S HOPES BUOYANT.
                343 as he descended from his carriage. My friend from Virginia met him, and taking
                his arm, kept his attention fixed upon other matters of public importance, until I
                had time to pro- cure my commission. I shall leave by the next train-and I think you
                had better go with me. You shall have an office in the city in my department." i
                "And deprive my friend, Patrick McClusky?" "Yes-all the paddies in the world. I see
                you and I un- derstand each other. We are both Know Nothings, and we have the same
                mission. The secretary has given me a list of names, from which he says the
                President and himself desire me to select three fourths of my subordinates. One
                third of them are foreigners, and at least one fourth are grog-sellers. I shall not
                obey. They may remove me from office; but I will not be moved from my determination.
                If one is to be responsible for the faithful performance of the duties of his of-
                fice, he ought to enjoy the privilege of selecting honest and capable subordinates."
                "I agree with you, most heartily. But I suppose my ap- pointment will be sent in
                to-day or to-morrow." Walter then related the substance of his interview with the
                President and the secretary. But Mr. Bell shook his head incredulously, though at
                the same time wishing his young friend every success. He could not forbear telling
                him, how- ever, that the appointment which had been conferred on him had previously
                been promised another, and that he had been surprised when he heard his name was
                sent up to the Senate. "There is many a slip," said he, " between the cup and the
                lip; and if you should be disappointed, come to me. But have the matter brought to a
                speedy. conclusion." He then took leave of Walter, as it was near the time when the
                next train left the city. He promised to see Miss Wilsome Winkle, and learn
                something further in relation to the lost check, not doubting McCluskv knew all
                about it. If it had been pre- sented under a forged indorsement, the exposure of the
                rascal would at least dispose of his pretensions for office, and it might be the
                means of putting some money in Walter's purse. A short time after the departure of
                Mr. Bell, Walter was waited on by Mr. Boozle, who bore him the comfortable as-
                surance that from what he could learn at the White House, and at the Department, it
                was settled that he should be ap- pointed consul to London. A new minister was to go

                fidential clerk to the plenipotentiary, that functionary was usually consulted, and
                the selection made among his personal acquaintances. For that reason Walter had been
                selected for the consulate. Boozle did not intimate any thing about the tipping
                portion of the negotiation; but merely congratu- lated his young friend on his
                prompt success. CHAPTER XXX. WALTER BECOMES ACQUAINTED WITH HONORIA-XAVIER, THE
                JESUIT CHEF-WALTER RECEIVES LETTERS FROM VIRGINIA. WALTER called the next day at the
                Department, but could not see the secretary; he was with the President; and of
                course the President could not be seen when in consultation with the cabinet
                ministers. But he saw Mr. Boozle, who as. sured him that his appointment was a
                settled thing, and that he need not give himself any further trouble about it.
                Walter spent the remainder of the day at the capitol, and was not at all annoyed to
                find the dark lustrous eyes of Mrs. Fimble, who sat near him in the gallery of the
                House, fre- quently turned in his direction. He was quite as attractive as a
                gentleman, as his sister was as a lady; and he was not slow to attribute the glances
                of the reigning belle to his supe- rior endowments. Nor was he the less flattered
                when he saw an almost imperceptible nod was sufficient to draw the most
                distinguished members in the Hall to her side. At the hotel, on the avenue, in short
                wherever they met, Walter had the satisfaction to observe that he arrested the
                belle's attention; and it was not remarkable that he should anxiously desire an
                opportunity of being formally introduced. But there was no one present who could
                render that service, except Plastic; and as he had fallen out with the member (for
                which he now con- demned himself), he exercised his wits to devise some other means
                of becoming acquainted with the lady, and fortune fa- vored him; for Honoria
                herself, upon a decision taking place on some interesting question, finding her
                company of honora- bles suddenly dispersed, rose up and moved in the direction of

                she smiled, and calling him! familiarly by his name, said they ought to be
                acquainted, as it had been three days since they were dwelling under the same roof.
                Walter was no novice in gallantry; and so, by the time they were at the foot of the
                stairs, no one could have supposed they had not been long upon terms of intimacy.
                They avoided the gallant old senator, who stood ready to assist the lady into his
                carriage, by passing through the grounds on the west side of the capitol. "I will
                not meet him," said Mrs. Fimble, " for we should quarrel. He suffered Mr. Bell to
                pass the Senate, when his vote would have still kept him hanging there." "But I
                understood from my friend, Mr. Bell," said Wal- ter, ' that it was on your account
                he left his seat." "An old politician to be bamboozled in that manner!" "Old
                politicians," said Walter, "as I learn by my reading, as well as experienced
                generals, have been, in all countries and in all ages, subject to the caprices-or
                rather the influences- of the divine sex. If Antony lost an empire to follow an

                shall not harshy reproach him. But my objection to Mr. Bell was " she paused. "May I
                know what it was?" asked Walter. "I have understood he belonged to a secret order,
                which would disfranchise foreigners and Catholics; and I am a Catholic." Walter
                averted his head just in time to escape the range of her dark eyes. It was evidently
                her design to scrutinize his features closely after the announcement she had just
                made, but she was prevented. "But you are no foreigner, and you do not wish to exer-
                cise the privilege of voting." "Oh, the members of the secret order, I presume, do
                not war against the women. I am sure, now, if you were one of the Know Nothings, I
                should not be apprehensive of any serious results arising from your hostility. But,"

                upon him, "I cannot avoid manifesting a sympathy for the members of our church
                foreign and native, whose privileges and welfare are menaced by a secret
                organization, whose ramifications extend into every locality, and whose members and
                operations are known to none but themselves." "I do not fear them," said Walter,
                returning the searching glance of the beautiful lady. "I do not fear them-at least,
                any more than I do the insidious order of the Jesuits; which, it is said, aim to
                obtain the supreme power in all governments. I know not whether the successors of
                Loyola, Francis Xavier and Borgia, admit the diviner sex into their counsels' but
                the danger must be very great if they do." "And, really, one might suppose you
                regarded me as one of their instruments!" "If that were the case, I should not fear
                their machina- tions. It could not be their purpose to inflict evil; and the new
                order of Know Nothings would soon be overthrown by them, unless they resorted to
                similar means for the purposes of hostility and defence." "A capital suggestion,
                which I must not fail to repeat to my father confessor. But then the enemy might
                improve upon your suggestion, and employ instruments like yourself to circumvent the
                fair agents of the Jesuits I What then?" "What then? Why, it seems to me I would
                like to turn propagandist. Seriously, though, my dear madam, I am a Protestant, and
                do fear the Jesuits more than the Know Nothings. Notwithstanding the protestations
                of the Catholic converts in Congress, or rather the demagogues-such, I mean, as once
                boasted of their Puritanical descent, but who, being very low originally, never
                could descend at all-I say, not- withstanding their solemn assertions to the
                contrary, we see by every arrival from abroad, that the Jesuits in Italy pro- claim
                an absolute monarchy as the only form of government sanctioned by their faith; and
                still assert that the Apostolic head of the Church is superior to kings in temporal
                au- thority." "I will answer that speech another time. You speak like an enemy, but
                do not look like one." "I speak in defence of Protestantism and my country- and to
                my countrywoman." THE JESUITS. '347 "But a Catholic. Remember that. You shall answer
                for it! They were now overtaken on the avenue by the carriage of the infatuated old
                senator, and Honoria (he used only that portion of Mrs. F.'s name) was constrained
                to abandon her young gallant, who had already excited the fear and envy of more than
                one official aspirant. That night the dark, lustrous eyes of Honoria illumined the
                dreams of Walter. In the shifting scenes of the phantas- magoria that filled his
                slumbers, she was ever present, and always in the attitude of striving unceasingly
                to entice him from the path he had been intent upon pursuing. And while he sighed
                upon his solitary pillow, the doors leading to the apartments of Honoria were
                stealthily opened by the servants of the Society of Jesus, who had been dis-
                tributed in all the hotels, and the modern Father Xavier was noiselessly admitted
                into the presence of the watchful woman. "Daughter!" said he, sternly, when the
                doors were closed behind him, and he stood alone before the prostrate Honoria, who
                sobbed at his feet; "you have been neglectful of your duty, and thereby inflicted
                upon the sacred cause a wound which may not be easily healed." "Oh, father!" said
                she, "it was the result of an imposi- tion which no one could have anticipated!
                "Every thing inimical to our interests which can possibly occur, should be
                anticipated and provided against. Your eyes, or the eyes of your agents, should be

                were present, but did not suspect--" "Remove them. Substitute others whose
                suspicions never can be lulled. This man, so unnecessarily approved by the Senate,
                will persecute our order to the utmost; and we shall have to resort to the extreme
                limits of our power, to enjoy any portion of the patronage within his gift. We must

                falsehood, for the sake of the end, and for the benefit of the cause. And all this,

                cushioned chair. "I will strive to incense the President and the secretary against
                Mr. Bell, so that he may be removed." "No, daughter. It will not avail. You might
                easily have him dismissed; but the elimination would weaken us, and injure our cause
                in other respects. The matter has been calmly weighed, and he must remain, unless
                removed without any agency of ours. There is other work for you to accom- plish. One
                half the offices in the country, and more than a moiety of the lucrative contracts,
                are already in our hands. We have the highest seat in the Judiciary, two members of
                the Cabinet, and forty thousand subordinates in various places. We shall elect the
                next President." "I know it, father! We have succeeded completely in gaining over to
                our cause, and quite imperceptibly to himself. the lion-hearted orator of Virginia."
                "Yes. He will be the new cezar de leon. But we must likewise have our sentinels at
                the outposts. Our general, who finds the minister at Paris impregnable and
                impracticable, will have him destroyed. The panic-stricken champion at London, must
                yield his position to one of firmer nerves. These are the objects which must never
                be absent from your thoughts. Remember, they are of paramount importance. But you
                are not to neglect the minor appointments. If we cannot have the plenipotentiaries,
                we must, at least, secure their secretaries, and as many of the consuls as
                possible." "There is one, father --" "About to be appointed. I know such is the
                purpose. It must be prevented!" "Alas, then, he, too, is an enemy!" "He is! But you
                may confine him with the silken fetters of your blandishments. Beware, though, that
                he does not fetter you! If he should conquer your heart, you will be lost for
                ever-both on earth, and in the world to come. He, too, has the lion-heart; but it
                could never be made to sub- serve our purposes. He must be beguiled by your arts-not

                consideration of the marriage we stipulated, is to convert the parish minister to
                our faith, under a dispensation permitting him to enjoy the society of his wife and
                children." "And, father," said Honoria, "it was true, then, as the papers said, that
                the singular speech of Walter Winkle de- feated the election of our candidate." "It
                was, daughter. But it is not to be regretted, since Plastic is likely to become a
                convert. Roland durst never disobey or betray us; but he has grovelling passions,
                and may be destroyed by one of his own acts, performed without our knowledge. He is,
                without knowing it, the legal husband of a poor inoffensive creature, and the
                consequences resulting from his rash act, may involve him in ruin. He is watched by

                not-you see I know every thing. He may live if he continues obedient-and you shall
                remain here if your efforts prove successful." Honoria bowed, and the Jesuit chief
                departed. WALTER RECEIVES A LETTER FROM HOME. 351 CHAPTER XXX. WALTER'S WONDERFUL
                ADVENTURES IN WASHNGTON-THE POLITICAL PANDEMONIUM. DAYS flew past, and yet Walter
                did not obtain his commis- sion. The papers throughout the country announced the ap-
                pointment, and yet it had not been sent in to the Senate. But the young man's
                patience was not exhausted. Honoria continued to amuse him by day, and he dreamt of
                her at night. Nevertheless there were others wfio desired to know some- thing in
                regard to the state of his affairs; and among those were his mother, and her guest,
                Virginia Oakdale. Walter had written to his mother but once since his sojourn in
                Wash. ington, and to Virginia not at all, except in a postscript to his mother's
                letter. And now, when the second or third letter from his parent was placed in his
                hands, it must be owned he did not hasten to break the seal with the same intensity
                of affection he had experienced upon the reception of the first. She wrote thus
                :-"At Babbleton we see the papers. From them we learn that you have become an
                official digni- tary. But we never could have supposed your exaltation would make
                you forget your mother and your friends so soon. We thought at least you would
                communicate the intelligence by letter, and not leave us to learn the fact, like the
                rest of the world, through the newspapers. Still we are rejoiced at your success,
                and humbly claim the privilege of tendering our congratulations. "Would you deign to
                read the news here, if I promise not to be tedious? Well, I promise. The mortgage on
                our house and grounds has been paid. Will you felicitate me on that? You must not
                ask where the money came from, for that is a secret upon which to exercise your
                faculty of guessing. But that is not all. Colonel Oakdale's debt to Roland has been
                paid. That must be news for you. You would never guess who loaned him the money, and
                I will tell you, so that you may pour out your gratitude to him should your

                has but slight hopes of cutting you off in that way. Bawson, the Scotch lawyer, is
                in frequent consultations with her; but Ser- geant Blore assures me the tawyer has

                would, I believe, in the event of no will being made, on his demise, go to his
                widow. The will he signed, no doubt was destroyed by Gusset, when she learned-and
                how she learned it is a mystery-that he had but a life estate in the land. "The poor

                and she fled. I believe he would have fired. He declares he will never be taken

                letter to Vir- ginia, but threw it aside as he heard the clock strike the hour when
                the doors of the Presidential Palace were to be thrown open for the reception of the
                promiscuous company that usually Ai resorted thither. As he surveyed himself in the
                glass, the thought occurred to him that it was exceedingly absurd to witness the
                decrepit senator of seven decades, bearing off the angelic Honoria, while he was
                under the necessity of proceeding alone, on foot, or riding in an omnibus. He
                resolved it should not be; and he quickly put in execution the thought that flashed
                across his mind. Knowing the senator would have to pass his door be- fore descending
                to the great hall, in front of which his carriage was in waiting, he determined to
                arrest his progress. He emptied his ink-bottle on some waste paper, and seizing a
                cord which lay under his bed, sallied out into the corridor, and tied the ends to
                two chairs standing several feet apart. The satu- rated paper was carefully placed
                upon the floor, and then he hastened back to his chamber. In a few minutes a
                tremendous racket was heard among the chairs, with which in the darkness the senator
                had become in- extricably entangled. In his desperate struggles several were crushed
                to atoms; but the cord being wound round his legs, he was thrown down upon the
                floor. Walter seizing his lamp rushed out, and found the old gentleman venting
                curses upon the children of the guests who had been playing with the chairs during
                the day. Walter assisted the senator to rise, and con- ducted him into his chamber,
                "I hope, sir, you have received no injury," said the young rogue. "Injury! Look at
                my vest! It was white, sir, a few minutes since. Now look at it! Look at my hands!
                What the devil is it? Ink! It's on my cravat, and my face " he continued, turning to
                Walter's glass. "Those mischievous <pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC6922-00000183"/> 354 THE WINKLES. children I children at a

                The infernal children!" ' "It is a great outrage, sir " said Walter. "It is, my
                young friend. And I am glad you regard it in that light. If any of my mess were to
                see me thus, and learn the manner of my fall, they would give vent to explosions of
                laughter, and take possession of my carriage and Honoria to- gether. They shall not
                see me. You sympathize with me gravely and sincerely, and Honoria I know entertains
                a favor- able opinion of your merit. Go to her, and describe my mis- hap, but in
                such a way that nothing ludicrous shall appear in it. Say I will follow if I succeed
                in removing these foul blots from my hands and face. Go, my young friend. The
                carriage is at the door, and the lady is awaiting me in the parlor." Walter did not
                linger. Although surprised, Honoria did not appear to be pained-to learn that her
                septuagenarian beau was rendered incapable of accompanying her to the soiree. In
                perfect beauty and spirits, and flashing with diamonds, she ac. cepted the arm of
                Walter and was conducted to the carriage, when one of the senator's men, who had
                been sent thither for the purpose, held open the door. After requesting the coachman
                to drive slowly, Walter followed his precious charge into the carriage, and occupied
                the seat at her side, where she welcomed him with a smile. "Now," said she, in a low
                tone, as they moved slowly away, "you must confess that you had some agency in pro-
                ducing this accident." "You were the cause of it," said Walter. "I? Oh I understand
                I But you might have seriously injured the old gentleman. It was very, very naughty
                of you. But as you say I was the cause of it, I must forgive you. And I must not
                betray you, or you would never have his vote on your nomination." Ah!" said Walter,
                it seems that my appointment is never to be sent in." "Why do they delay it?" "It is
                a mystery--unless it may be accounted for in the withdrawal of Plastic's
                recommendation. It seems that I gave him offence. But, still, the President, whom I
                have seen since then, assures me my claims, on account of his friendship for THE
                TEMPTER. 355 my father, and my own merits-the very words he used-are quite
                sufficient. The difficulty must lie in the State Depart- ment-but I can learn
                nothing from the secretary." "What does he say?" "He tells me to have patience, and
                to come often for in- structions in regard to the duties. I am daily wasting the
                precious hours over international law and a confused multipli- city of treaty
                stipulations, perhaps to no purpose. I have heard of one gentleman, relying on their
                promises of an ap- pointment to France, who spent several months in learning the
                French verbs, but at last only travelled home in disgust." "I wish I could aid
                you-but then in the event of another such accident as happened this evening, what
                should I do?" "Every one assures me your aid would be effectual. And yet I confess I
                should leave the city with reluctance. But necessity knows no law, or rather yields
                to no inclinations, and whether I obtain my commission or not, I must soon take my
                leave of you." "Indeed! Why? Are your finances low, like those of most of the
                hangers-on at the capital." "Yes, truly. I think I should have abandoned the pursuit
                of office before this, if there had been no other attraction." "Again I am the
                cause! Well, it is incumbent on me to replenish your purse. Have you ever visited
                Aurini's saloon .?" "The gambling hell? No!" "None but gentlemen are admitted-and
                they say none but the rich can lose, and their losses are enormous. What becomes of
                the money is a mystery. My husband has been there twice since we came to Washington,
                and was both times quite successful. He borrowed this ring of me," she continued,
                taking one from her finger and placing it on Walter's hand, "and pledged it for ten
                dollars, at the farthest table from the door, at the extreme end of the room. He won
                invariably. Keep the ring and test your fortune." "I will wear the ring," said
                Walter. "If you do not use it in the manner my husband did," said Honoria, " you
                must return it at the end of three days. My husband may return; and he may have use
                for it. He deems it a charmed ring. The carriage stops. We are at the portico." They
                descended from the carriage, and were swept along i <pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC6922-00000184"/> 356 THE WINKLES.
                with the stream of human beings into the presence of the chief Executive of the
                nation, who strode forward to meet Honoria, with whom he exchanged most cordial
                salutations, and upon whom he bestowed the most flattering speeches. He told her his
                own reign was over for the night, that he should be eclipsed by a brighter luminary,
                etc. Then turning to Walter, whose hand he shook very heartily, he said: "My young
                friend, you have the most potent advocate in the city. I shall have to invoke your
                influence with your friend. to induce her to exercise her power over the legislators
                for the consum- 1nation of the great measures of the government. Whatever she
                decrees must be the law." "I hope shewill have pity, then, on her humble servant,"
                said Walter. "What do you mean?" she asked, as they emerged from 'the circle round
                the President, and moved away towards the great east room. "Oh, any thifg or
                nothing. I supposed it necessary to make some response to the President's nonsense,
                and did not know exactly what I was uttering." "I saw Father Xavier turn his
                piercing eyes towards us. He is my confessor. Be careful what you say in his hearing
                -and remember that he sees and hears almost every thing. " Walter was on the eve of
                uttering a sarcasm on the priest when he perceived the Jesuit had followed them, and
                thought he could discover a tremor in the fair hand that lay upon his arm. Honoria
                sank on a sofa, and Walter was beckoned aside by Mr. Boozle. The priest uttered a
                few words in the lady's ear and disappeared in the crowd. And then Honoria was
                surrounded by a number of worshippers. The high official dignitaries of other
                nations, as well as the American, vied in their adulations. And she surprised every
                one by the extent of her information. She knew something of the history of every man
                of mark who approached her; of their objects, their hopes, their fears; and her
                witty repartees often con- cealed the most startling allusions, which, however, were
                only appreciated by those for whom they were intended. She was familiar with the
                details of every intrigue for the presidency, every stratagem to destroy the
                prospects of the most prominent individuals, and every secret of diplomacy. She knew
                also the designs of ambitious mothers, the longings and aversions of the smiling
                daughters; the chances of expectants, and the AN AMERICAN DISQUALIFIED FOR OFFICE.
                357 impending destruction of confident incumbents. No wonder, then, that her words
                were listened to with the reverence of oracles from the lips of a pythoness; that
                her hostility should be deprecated, and her favor implored by all. Even Walter, from
                her 'supposed partiality for him. was overwhelmed with attentions by the greedy crew
                of minor office-seekers. "Mr. Winkle," said Boozle, leading Walter into an oh- scure
                recess, " every body is asking why the official announce- ment of your confirmation
                by the Senate is delayed." "If I knew the proper one to interrogate," said Walter, I
                would like to ask the same question; I presume, however, my name has not yet reached
                the Senate." "No-not yet. Do you know how the papers which havo been announcing your
                appointment obtained the information?" I do not. I suppose they had it from the
                Department." "They are opposition papers. Such premature announce- ments do no
                good." "I had no agency in them. You will please say as much for me to the
                secretary. Perhaps something of this kind has caused the delay. I am growing very
                impatient, and have ex- pended my money." "I am sure I wish you had thousands. But
                you are aware I suppose that Mr. Plastic has withdrawn --." "I anticipated as much.
                He is a man of no weight, of no importance whatever except in his own estimation;
                and be- tween us, he will never have another opportunity to misrepre- sent our
                people." "Besides," continued the imperturbable Boozle, "some one has informed the
                secretary that you are a Native American." "I was not born in Rome. What is the
                Secretary himself but a native? This is trifling with me; if such difficulties are
                to be trumped up to delay or defeat my appointment, I will see him to-morrow, and
                know exactly what I am to expect." "What I mean is that it is intimated you are a
                Know Nothing. It is true men of all parties are joining that secret order; but the
                organ of the administration having taken ground against it, the K. N's are to be
                henceforth regarded as our enemies." "That may be the policy of the administration,
                and I shall say nothing in opposition to it. I shall answer no ques- <pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC6922-00000185"/>

                such things as concern myself alone." : Don't be hasty. I have not said the
                secretary believes the intimation well founded----" "What business is it of the
                secretary's to believe or dis. believe any thing of the sort concerning me? I have
                not changed my principles, and do not mean to change them. If I have sufficient
                claims and qualifications for the office I seek, let him and the President decide my
                case on such grounds alone!" "No doubt they will. But you must admit they have cause
                to deprecate the furious assaults daily formed in the Know Nothing organ. These
                attacks are exceedingly annoy- ing. "No question of it. And I think some of them are
                de- served--" "Mr. Winkle!" "You must admit too many foreigners are permitted to
                exercise control. The people will not stand it; and the ad- ministration ought to be
                warned in time." I agree with you, to some extent. But then the sting- ing ridicule
                the editor of the American deals in-the unlimit- - ed sarcasms he employs-see! there
                he is now-and he has the effrontery to come here with his great blue goggles!1' "Oh,
                my dear sir, this house belongs to the people; and on public occasions such as the
                present, the President has no authority to exclude friend or foe." "Very true. But
                still it would be a meritorious action to rebuke an enemy of the President--"
                "Undoubtedly! In what way do you mean " By a chivalrous act-such as your father once
                per- formed." "( My father pulled some one's nose for slandering his friend." "Yes,
                and that silenced and subdued the calumniator. Well, the President is your friend,
                and the American, as he conceives, slanders him daily. If you were to make it a per-
                sonal matter, and--" "Get shot for him, he would bestow the appointment on me as an
                equivalent. Is that it?" "Certainly not! No man was ever killed in Washington by an
                editor. You need have no apprehension." WALTER BECOMNG DISGUSTED. 359 "Apprehension?
                I do not understand you. Let me have a just quarrel-and I may have one-and we'll see
                who'll be troubled with apprehensions. I know the editor of the Amer- ican-and I amn
                satisfied he has a pacific disposition. Why the deuce don't your own organ-man
                resent some of the charges brought against the President and himself?" '"I know not.
                But will we see you to-morrow?" Yes-for the last time, I think, unless my matter be
                promptly disposed of." They separated, and Walter approached as near as he could to
                the great centre of attraction, the brilliantly dia- demed Honoria. She was flashing
                her glorious eyes at the editor of the American, who listened enraptured to her
                thrill- ing accents. Walter perceived immediately that she had some design upon his
                friend; and although he might feel some pricks of jealousy, he did not deem it
                expedient to attempt an interposition. The editor, though evidently charmed, was not
                embarrassed; and when the promenade was resumed, the queenly Honoria took possession
                of his arm. It was quite late when the discomfited senator appeared: but his
                presence sufficed to banish Walter from the side of the reigning belle. Not so with
                the editor of the American. Satisfied he had the approbation of the lady herself,
                all the powers of the government were unequal to the task of ban- ishing him from
                her presence; and he stood at the door of the carriage and assisted her up the
                steps, when she retired from the White House, although the senator was a bitter
                opponent of his party. Walter returned to his lodgings on foot, having declined the
                faint invitation of the senator to occupy a seat ij his car- riage. He found two
                letters on his table. The first he opened was from Mr. Bell, requesting him io
                transmit the letter he had received from Patrick McClusky, that the writing on the
                back of the lost check, which had been found, might be com- pared with it. He said
                he entertained no doubt that Paddy was a bungling forger; and although he might not
                be able to convict him of the offence, still he could frighten him off the list of
                pertinacious applicants for office. His aunt declined replacing the check, having
                seen the announcement of his ap- pointment to a lucrative post, and supposing him to
                be in no need of pecuniary assistance. The other was from his landlord, enclosing
                his bill. Wal- <pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC6922-00000186"/> 360 THE WINKLES. ter counted the few coins remaining in his
                purse, and ascer- taincd that he did not possess one fifth the amount demanded. What
                was he to do? His eye fell upbn the ring which Ho- noria had placed on his finger.
                He gazed at it long in deep abstraction, and was only awakened from his lethargy by
                the. returning consciousness that he was unable to satisfy his host's demand.
                Starting up, he determined to go to Aurini's. In. all his life he had never won or
                lost a dollar in any such estab- lishment; and certainly nothing less than the
                instigation of such a creature as Honoria could have induced him to try the hazard
                of the game. But why should he pledge the ring, when he still possessed a few coins.
                He looked at it again, and discovered the form of a cross set in small diamonds. Was
                it not abominable to use such an emblem in such a place? But Honoria sanctioned it,
                and even seemed to require it. Her will was irresistible. He descended to the
                street, and after striding but a few hundred. paces, found himself standing before
                the dark en- trance to the noted establishment, which no law could sup. press, and
                no resolution withstand. Walter recollected the word which had been given him, and
                repeated it at the door. e was admitted, and conducted through a long and dimly
                lighted passage. Then a door on the right was thrown open, and he stood within a
                brilliantly illuminated saloon, where the tables were piled with gold, and hundreds
                were watching with eager interest the turning of the cards which announced their
                success or disaster. He paused for a moment, and calmly surveyed the scene. Among
                the company he recognized faces he had seen in the halls of Congress, a member of
                the Cabi- net, several resident foreign ministers with numerous attach6s, and a
                score of comptrollers, auditors, clerks and messengers. Recollecting his
                instructions, the young man approached the table at the farthest end of the saloon,
                and exhibited the ring. At the sight of it there was some commotion among the
                keepers of the table, and a mysterious deference was mani- fested in their dealings
                with him. The sum he named was given him, and every turn of the cards announced him
                a wiu- ner; but it was impossible to excite any emotions of cupidity in his breast.
                The prospect of large gains was certainly in- viting; and he could have no means of
                conjecturing to what extent he might rely upon the favors of fortune. Nevertheless,
                THE MAGIC RING. 361 he turned away with a very moderate accumulation, bearing the
                redeemed ring along with him. Returned to his lodgings, he counted his gains and was
                astonished to find he possessed, after deducting the amount of his landlord's bill,
                precisely the sum he had counted on the same table the first night of his arrival in
                the city. It was a to find, its solution. He repaired immediately to the office
                below and- settled the bill. Whether it was the unexpected sight of the money, or
                whether there had really been a mis- conception of the proprietor s instructions,
                the clerk declared the bill had been presented through mistake, and that it might
                remain unpaid, if Mr. Winkle desired it, until the end of the month. Walter did not
                desire it, and hence it was paid. But many apologies were uttered. After a troubled
                sleep, during which Honoria seemed to guide his steps through many perilous paths,
                but only to en- counter new difficulties and dangers, Walter arose with a half-
                formed resolution to tear asunder the meshes which confined him, and return to his
                mother and thefaithful Virginia. Once more only would he apply at the Department;
                after that, if his appointmeht were again postponed indefinitely, he would abandon
                the pursuit, and seek some less equivocal means of support. In the forenoon he
                obtained an interview with IIonoria in her private arlor. She was most elegantly
                dressed, and said she had been expecting him. "I desire merely to return this ring,"
                said Walter. "Yes," said she, smiling, , I must receive it back; but I did not think
                you would part with it so readily. I had hoped it possessed some talismanic
                virtues." "It has performed its mission faithfully. I obeyed your instructions, and
                have now a replenished purse. But I cannot touch the money without experiencing a
                thrill of horror." "Horror? Why?" "The ring has restored the sum, exactly, that I
                counted on my table the day of my arrival in the city." "That does seem to be a
                singular circumstance. Perhaps some one, unregarded at the time, saw you count the
                money." "An Irishman may have come in to stir the fire, or a maid to sweep the
                hearth, and they might have heard .me name the sum; but who could tell what would be
                the amount of my 16 <pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC6922-00000187"/> 362 T1HE WINKLES. landlord's bill, or the sum total of my
                expenditures in my rambles about town? It was not the work of chance. Nei. ther was
                it a natural sensation which the exhibition of the ring produced at the gaming
                table." "You will at least be convinced that a Providence watches over and protects
                you." "I cannot avoid mistrusting that Providence which would consign me to a hell
                for relief." o("Mercy on us Do not use profanity. There are many things niow
                incomprehensible to you which may be explained i hereafter. But your purse is
                replenished, and you will not he unpp from the fear of duns." "I shall, I think,
                leave the city, to-day." "No! Oh no! Do not for my sae--I mean for your own. Let me
                aid you. They say I am omnipotent with the predominant powers." "I will go once more
                to the Department. But they shall not-any longer trifle with me. I have neglected my
                duty to my mother, and fear I have offended--" "Who have you offended?" "No matter."
                "I know. I learned this morning from one who passed through Babbleton yesterday,
                that Col. Oakdale has been elected senator on the hundredth ballot. You know I must
                keep well posted in such matters. And it was the casting vote of one of the
                Babbleton representatives, elected by your famous speech, that gave the victory." "I
                am rejoiced to hear it." "I then inquired about the colonel's family, and learned
                starting up S' Snobson addressing Virginia". "My informant may have been in error.

                sure I hope the information respecting the new senator's laughter was ill founded."
                "Pardon me, Honoria. If it can afford you pleasure, rely upon it, I will go through
                flames to attend you." Walter withdrew and strode slowly along the avenue. He was
                soon overtaken and. passed by Honoria's messenger. When he arrived at the
                Department, he sought a chair in the ^nte-room, then crowded with applicants for the
                various offices it the disposal of the great man at the head of the Cabinet. But he
                was soon found by Boozle and conducted into the presence of the secretary, who
                received him with a smile. "Sit down, my friend," said the secretary. "Excuse me,"
                said Walter, dryly, determined no longer ;o be made a laughing-stock of the tricky
                officials-"I have but a moment to stay, and this is my final visit. If my fate
                3annot be decided without further delays, I shall desire to vithdraw my

                of youth, and--" "Pardon me, sir, for interrupting you. But first show me necessity

                In that way she may serve you, and you will do well to secure her advocacy. But be
                careful she does not make a Catholic of you. Mr. they say, has actually been to
                mass. Adieu." Walter hurried back to the hotel with a smile on his lip, and
                exultation in his heart. Honoria's carriage was at the door, although the weather
                was fine for walking. But she insisted on Walter's riding with her, and they drove a
                mile beyond the capitol before alighting at it. In the rotunda, on the stairs and in
                the galleries, the beautiful creature received the tributes of all classes and
                sexes, for she was now at the summit of her power; and whatever might have been
                secretly thought by the envious or the considerate, no one ventured to breathe a
                syllable of detraction. The value of her favor had been experienced by thousands,
                and the effects of her hos- tility had been tested by not a few. The marvel was,
                that Walter, whose appointment had been unofficially announced, had not yet passed
                the Senate. That day the Senate adjourned at an earlier hour than usual; and upon
                the motion of Honoria's admirer. One of the senators opposed to the motion, jocosely
                attributed the mover's impatience, to the fact, that a certain divinity pre- sided
                in the gallery at the other end of the capitol. Walter relinquished his charge when
                the gallant old gen- tleman approached, after congratulating him upon the removal of
                the blots of the preceding evening. The senator replied that it was truly an
                achievement for any public man to oblit. erate entirely the foul stains of ink. The
                same evening Walter was surprised by the delivery into his hand of a formidable
                envelope, which at first he sup- posed to be his long-hoped-for commission; but the
                Babbleton postmark being upon it he was soon undeceived, and the throb. bings of his
                heart were suddenly repressed. He tore open the envelope, and some twenty letters of
                his own, written to Virginia, fell upon the table! Then his heart almost ceased to
                beat. What could it mean He had cer- tainly not been a voluminous correspondent
                since his sojourn in the Federal city; but he did not deem that neglect a suf-
                ficient provocation to have the whole volume of his former epistolatory labors
                thrust back upon himd On the blank page of one of the letters he found the following
                lines traced in pencil marks:-"Henceforth I am THE LETTER OF DISMSSAL. 365 to be a
                stranger to the writer of these letters. One who is so oblivious of his pledges will
                be relieved, rather than pained at this absolution, which is meant to be complete
                and irrevo- cable. Irrevocable, because when he shall prove false to the captivating
                Honoria, he may attempt to become reconciled to the one who was the first to listen
                to his declarations. V. O." "The deuce!" cried Walter, starting up and traversing
                the room rapidly backwards and forwards, while his temples burned and his thoughts
                boiled in inextricable confusion. "How has she heard any thing in relation to my
                intimacy with Honoria? And what has she heard? Some infernal lie! And at a time,
                too, when she is entangling that puppy Snobson-the son of a snob! What have I done?
                From the President down to the deputy postmaster, all are striving for the smiles of
                Honoria. She is the most beautiful-the most intelligent--the most-but she's a
                married woman, and never was worth the twentieth part of Virginia I I have been a
                fool-and Virginia's a fool to listen to such slanders! And to send my letters back
                on account of a little innocent flirtation with a married woman! I won't explain any
                thing! If she can't ascertain my meaning, and justify my conduct without assistance,
                she may expire in ignorance. But if Snobson comes here dangling after her, I'll kick
                him into the middle of the avenue! If we are to be strangers when we meet, she shall
                at least behold me with the finest woman in the city leaning on my arm!" A note from
                Honoria was brought in by a demure Irish girl. Walter glanced at it hastily, and
                immediately followed a' the messenger into Honoria's private parlor, where he found
                the lady Sitting alone. Shepointed to an ottoman at her side, and Walter threw
                himself on it. "You seem disturbed in mind," said she. "I have cause to be. Mr. -
                informs me that my name has not yet been sent in to the Senate and I hear from
                home-.---".; ' What?" "No matter. It is a private affair." We' are in private. I am

                366 . ' THE WINKLES. "I do not understand it myself. Your ring replenished my purse;
                your note to the President caused him to send for my name, and perhaps your old
                Senator may confirm my nom. ination, if it should really be made. Your friendship
                has lost me my love-the love of Miss Oakdale, and I don't see how I am to be
                compensated for that. You should have suf fered me to depart without my commission,
                as I shall proba. bly be compelled to do yet." "Lost your love! Why do you think
                so?" "She has returned my letters. She says we are to be strangers when we meet, and
                she will be here soon." "She will be reconciled, when she sees you avoid my com.
                pany." "Then she shall look in vain, unless you repulse me. She has acted foolishy,
                and ought to suffer for it-or rather un- dergo the penalty of making amends." "I
                will not avoid you, I think you are right. I learn Col. Oakdale and his daughter
                will be here to night." "How? At this hotel?" "No. At a private boarding-house. Will
                your heart not fail you?" .. "It never did yet. I think not." "We'll soon see. But
                here is company." Several gentlemen entered, and among them .the editor of the
                administration journal. Walter withdrew, returning coldly the salutations of the
                visitors. He thought it strange that people of all parties should be seeking
                admission to Ho- noria, utterly forgetting that he belonged to an order avowedly
                hostile to the political advancement of Roman Catholics. Then he thought- the last
                number of the American paper was somewhat softened in its tone in regard to the
                religion of the papists; admitting that there might be angels of that faith, and
                against which war was not to be waged. But his thunders redoubled against the
                temporal power of the Vati- can as exercised in Catholic countries; and against the
                party of the President, whose proclivities seemed to point towards the Catholic vote
                in the United States. The next day, Walter waited on the President, and was admitted
                by the doorkeeper, who supposed that any one on terms of intimacy with the lady for
                whose smiles all the magnates were striving, should not be kept waiting at the door
                of the Executive palace. AN OLD FRIEND. 367 The President was in an ill humor at
                something he had seen in the papers, but strove to receive the young man kindly. He
                said he had not sent in the nomination, for the reason that a great many
                appointments remained unacted on before the Senate and they were taken up according
                to their dates. It would be useless to crowd the tables with new names, while the
                old ones had not received attention. And he exhorted his young friend to have
                patience. His turn would come. If any thing occurred to frustrate his intention, it
                would be announced to him, &amp;c. Walter bowed, and retired in silence. CHAPTER
                XXXII. WALTER'S DIPLOMACY IN PRISON. WALTER determined not to be importunate. He had
                obtained many promises from the men in power-and if they had the slightest regard
                for their honor, he could not be much longer kept in suspense. For several days he
                did nothing but attend Honoria, who seemed to demand more of his time than ever, and
                to exert her blandishments to banish the idea he entertained of leaving the city, in
                the event of a'disappointment. The first intimation that Walter had of the arrival
                of Colonel Oakdale and Virginia, was from the newly-elected senator himself. He was
                promenading along the avenue in company with Honoria, when a carriage drove slowly
                by, from which he heard his own name uttered, and the next moment the colonel's head
                was thrust out of the window. "How are you, Walter, my boy?" cried the colonel. "I
                am sent for by the President, and will know why your name has not been laid before
                the Senate. Why don't you come and see us? We have been here two days. I would have
                been in my seat last week, but I could not leave that flock of partridges, in the
                old stubble field. Remember, mum's the word about the woodcock! What are you hiding
                for, Virginia? Come and see us, Walter. I have a great deal to tell you. Good day.
                Now drive rapidly, Jarvie!" The next moment <pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC6922-00000190"/> 368 THE WINKLES. the horses
                were flying along the avenue, and Walter did not have an opportunity to utter a word
                in reply. "That was Virginia," said Honoria. "' No. It was Colonel Oakdale," said
                Walter. "I saw a green bonnet, and a beautiful little nose." "Then it was Virginia!
                I thought I heard him mention her name. And she would not speak to me!" "Her father
                did not give her an opportunity. What a pity!" "Why does she treat me thus? What
                have I done to deserve it?" "You have offended her, by your attentions to me. You
                seem distressed." "I am melancholy. Has she not been attended to-by that son of a
                snob?" "Oh, I suppose so! And are you not angry with her for it?" "Certainly not.
                But I will break his bones if he Pshaw! nonsense! I will see her to-day, or---"
                "What?" "Go home, and become a candidate for Congress at the next election. And I
                will beat Plastic. Then the President and his secretary shall ;hear my thunder!"
                "You frighten me! Perhaps your nomination will be decided to-day. Then you could not
                leave immediately. And when you do leave, my old friend will, I think, rejoice!" "Do
                you know he is my friend? He pledged me his word this very morning, that he would
                vote for me even if I were to avow myself an American, and a protestant. Think of
                that, ye foreigners and papists!" "I shall have to torture him! But here we are in
                front of the hotel, and there is my senator to receive me from your hands." Walter
                strode away, and walked in solitude an hour on the common. Returning, he met one of
                the carriers of the government newspaper, whom he had seen deliver the paper at the
                hotel. From him he learned that the sheet was left at Mrs. Z's, on F. street, for
                the Honorable Mr. Oakdale, and thither he repaired, supposing Virginia might have
                been put down there by her father, or that they might have had time to return from
                the presidential mansion. A VISIT TO MSS OAKDALE. 369 Walter rang, and asked the boy
                for Colonel Oakdale. "He hab just left for the capitol. He merely stopped a moment
                on his return from the President's." "Is Miss Oakdale in?" "Yes, sir." Give her that
                card, and say I should be happy to see her.". The boy disappeared, but returned in a
                few moments after with an altered countenance. "She says she is indisposed, sir-not
                ill, but---" "What?" demanded Walter. "I am sure I do not know, sir; but she ordered
                me to re- turn the card." Walter turned away abruptly in a whirl of contending
                passions, and never paused until he sat down at the table in his room. He wrote a
                most impassioned letter to Virginia, imploring her to inform him what it was in his
                conduct which had offended her. He declared most solemnly that his object and
                purpose in cultivating the friendship of Mrs. Fimble-he did not write Honoria-was
                solely to secure her co-operation in obtaining his appointment, and-he confessed
                it-to gratify his vanity in monopolizing as much of her attention as possi- ble in
                public, because the most distinguished men in the Union were competing for her
                smiles. Nothing more, as heaven was his witness! And he adjured Virginia to re-con-
                sider her decision, and grant him an interview, when he pledged himself to explain
                every thing to her satisfaction. He likewise reminded her of his innocence when
                censured on a former occasion, and declared, if she would only hear him in his
                defence, he would again be vindicated in her estimation. This letter he dispatched
                immediately, and directed the servant to wait for an answer. He then joined Honoria
                in her private parlor, where there were several senators and their wives and
                daughters engaged in a lively conversation. "Have you seen her?" asked Honoria, in a
                low tone, when one of the ladies sat down to the piano. "No-but I think I will,
                soon." "I doubt it," said she, in a brief pause of the conversation, which she had
                the faculty, it was said, of maintaining with half a dozen at the sametime, and on
                different subjects. Presently the messenger made his appearance at the door and sent
                in a letter to Walter. 16* <pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC6922-00000191"/> 370 THE WINKLES. "You may break the seal
                here," said Honoria, in a side speech. Walter did so, and his own letter--the seal
                unbroken--fell from the envelope. He stooped down and lifted it from the floor.
                "Stooping makes one's blood rush to the face," said Ho noria, archly. "And
                afterwards the reaction produces a paleness." "I am calm," said Walter. "And
                determined?" "Ay, determined." And seizing the first opportunity, he locked himself
                up in his room and bestowed extraordinary pains in the adornment of his person. He
                was determined to appear in hilarious spirits at the secretary's reception that
                night, where he would meet with Virginia and Honoria. He would confide in his aged
                friend, the noble old senator, who would not hesitate to co-operate with him in the
                execution of his capricious scheme. Twice .he was startled by messages from Honoria,
                who -seemed to comprehend what had taken place, and perhaps thought he might
                perpetrate some desperate deed. He sent her word that so far from being ill, he was
                merely making his toilet for the purpose of attending the secretary's party, whither
                he hoped to be permitted to accompany her in Senator - --- 'is coach. There were
                nearly seven hundred people at the secretary's party, all crammed within a private
                mansion of the ordinary size. But room was made every where for Honoria, who was
                never separated far from Walter. "Walter!" cried Col. Oakdale, who, with Virginia
                hang. ing on his arm, confronted our hero in the midst of the saloon, and that too
                when all eyes were on them, "you are the luckiest of my constituents. Introduce me."
                Walter did so. "Now, Virginia-where is she?" she had escaped, and taken refuge with
                the secretary's lady, who perceived her em- barrassment, and came to her relief.
                "Well, my young gentleman" continued the colonel, "if you do not obtain ad-
                vancement, with your good fortune and address, I am no prophet. I congratulate you
                with all my heart." "I thank you, sir," said Honoria. "Why, I have only bowed to
                you. My speech was ad THE PARTY AT THE SECRETARY'S. 371 dressed to the lucky fellow
                at your side. But the ladies, somehow, continue to intercept all the compliments.
                Yet I warn you to beware of the new rival. Do you not see the crowd of adorers at
                the other end of the room? This young gentleman, if there has been no rupture
                between them, of which I kn9w nothing- "Know Nothing?" iterated Honoria. "Come,
                come, no politics with me. I abhor them. This young gentleman, I say, will soon be
                bowing among her wor- shippers, but not to perish there." "There is a prediction for
                you," said Honoria to Walter, when the colonel moved away. "Alas, not to be
                fulfilled," was the response. Again, in the counter currents of promenades Walter
                con- fronted Virginia, and endeavored to speak to her, but in vain for she averted
                her face and laughed very heartily at some remark of Mr. Ponsonby, the British
                Secretary of Legation. And indeed almost the entire diplomatic corps seemed to fol-
                low the new beauty whithersoever she moved; and a close observer might have detected
                a slight elongation of the features of Honoria, at the rapid progress of her rival.
                In every direction she heard the praises of Virginia; and for the first time during
                the gay season she perceived she was reign- ing over a divided empire. Nevertheless
                she was not neglected by the seekers of office, or the bestowers of it. The Presi-
                dent himself detained her several minutes, until he could deliver a paragraph of
                praises; and there were ten or fifteen senators engaged in the gallant enterprise of
                an attempt to supplant her old beau. Walter was particularly distinguished by the
                cordial salu- tations of the chief executive officer, which he thought might be
                interpreted as a good augury. At length Honoria, whether really unwell as she
                alleged, or conscious of being abandoned by half the multitude for the superior
                blandishments of the new belle, was to remain an unfathomable secret. but she
                quietly withdrew, and re- linquished the field to her competitor. And she insisted
                on being accompanied by Walter, who was more active than the aged senator, and might
                withdraw without incurring the im- putation of perpetrating a breach of etiquette.
                And when he had deposited his charge at the hotel, to avoid a violation of
                propriety, and to enable his senatorial friend to reach his <pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC6922-00000192"/> 372 THE WINKLES.
                lodginge, it was necessary for him to return in the carriage to the secretary's
                mansion. Enfranchised from the captivating thraldom of Honoria, Walter promenaded
                the halls and saloons in quest of Virginia. He found her-but she would not recognize
                him. Yet he, who knew her so well, and could read her countenance so ac- curately,
                did not fail to perceive that her mind was troubled, and that her heart was ill at
                ease, even under the incessant flow of Ponsonby's flatteries. And Ponsonby, although
                the son of an Earl, inspired no fears in his bosom. Ponsonby was but a noble in
                Great Britain-Winkle a sovereign in America. But Winkle retraced his steps, alone,
                to his hotel, while Ponsonby conducted to her home the senator's lovely daugh. ter.
                And Walter passed an uneasy night in a boundless sea of conjecture, endeavoring in
                vain to foresee the end and consummation of the drama in which he felt he was one of
                the principal actors. The next morning, as usual, he was summoned to appear before
                Honoria in her parlor. She stood beside her mirror, pale, and a tear glistening in
                her eye. "What has happened, Honoria?" demanded Walter, grave- ly, and with some
                symptoms of impatience. "Oh, it is outrageous!" said she. "They have deceived you
                vilely. Read the paper. But restrain your anger." Walter ran his eye along the
                editorial column of one of the government journals, and was surprised to find his
                own name at the head of a paragraph, as follows:- MR. WALTER WINKLE.-The public
                cannot have failed to see this gentleman's name going the rounds of the press, in
                connection with the appointment of a new consular agent at the port of London.
                Whence the letter writers obtained their information, it is not material to inquire.
                That all ap- pointments really made, first appear in the columns of the ad-
                ministration papers, and Mr. W.'s name not having been trans- mitted to us, is alone
                a sufficient contradiction of the rumor. But we deem it proper to say, that the fact
                of Mr. W. being one of the fraternity of N. A.'s, so generally hostile to the
                administration, would render it both impolitic for the Presi- dent to bestow, and,
                under the circumstances, in our opinion dishonorable in Mr. W. to receive, any such
                mark of distinc- tion. It is not, therefore, at all probable his name will be WALTER
                SEEKS REDRESS. 373 transmitted to the Senate by the present incumbent of the
                presidential office." "I entreat you to restrain any violent passion that may--- "
                "I am perfectly calm," said Walter smiling. "I am glad the mists have broken away at
                last, and I can see the land.- I rejoice at it. I will be guilty of no such
                extravagance as the outhurst of violent passion you seem to have anticipated. The
                man of imperturbable deliberation is the most dangerous --and I feel that they have
                roused an enemy whose resources they have had no means of correctly estimating. Do
                you know that one of the creatures of the Executive once intima. ted that I might
                render a service to the administration by fighting a duel with the editor of the
                American journal? I thank him for that word!" "I did not suggest it-- did not
                sanction it." "No one could suppose such a thing, Honoria. But inthat case there was
                no provocation. In this- " "There is insult and injury It cannot be denied-it cannot
                be concealed!" "True--very true. You will not betray me, Honoria? You will grant
                this my earnest request, that you will not thwart my just intention to demand
                satisfaction? You are silent Why should you interfere? All hope of my appointment is
                at an end. The paragraph was written at the White House. This business with the
                editor alone detains me in the District -and we may never meet again. As my last
                request, I ask that you will not interfere." "I will not." "I thank you. Remain at
                home to-day." "I will." Walter withdrew to his chamber, and wrote as follows to the
                editor: "Si :--The article in your paper in reference to myself, being evidently
                prepared with no design of future explanation and amicable adjustment, there is no
                other alternative left me but to demand the satisfaction which every gentleman has a
                right to require of the one who has injured him. This- it is my intention to do, as
                soon as I arrive at Bladensburg, which will be as quickly as the fleetest horses I
                can procure may transport me thither; and whither you will doubtless likewise repair
                without delay." <pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC6922-00000193"/> 374 THE WINKLES. This note was despatched by one of the
                servants of the hotel to the office of the editor, with directions to wait for an
                answer. Walter intended to escape from the District be- fore consulting any friend,
                or even procuring weapons, relying i upon the chances of obtaining them after
                passing beyond the limits of the jurisdiction of the authorities of the District.
                But when he was in consultation with the book-keeper of the hotel, in reference to a
                carriage, the messenger he had Ji sent to the printing office returned, accompanied
                by two offi- cers of the marshal, who immediately arrested our hero! "You pronounce
                me your prisoner," said Walter. "I have -i no means of resistance, and must submit.
                But may I not ask upon whose motion or information you proceed?" a "Certainly. The
                messenger placed the note in the hands i of the marshal himself." "Michael!" said
                Walter, " why did you act thus?" "Sure I wouldn't say so handsome a gintleman going
                out I with nasty pistols to be shot!" "Enough, sir! Gentlemen, do your duty; but
                beware you i do not transcend it." "We know the law, sir. You must come with us to
                the magistrate's office." And Walter was not ignorant of the law, nor in doubt as to
                his future course of conduct. He therefore asked and ob- tained permission to spend
                a short time in his own chamber, attended by an officer, while he arranged his
                trunk, as if for its removal. He returned to the office of the hotel, paid his bill,
                and left instructions for his baggage to be sent after him. He then stepped into a
                hack with the officers, and they were driven to the magistrate's office. The news of
                the projected duel and the arrest of one of the parties, soon spread over the city,
                and was immediately circulated in both houses of Congress. So that before Wal- ter
                had been many minutes in the office of the magistrate, he was surrounded by a large
                crowd of people, a majority being his friends-at least they were Native Americans.
                The magistrate, before whom the note, which fortunately was not quite a challenge,
                was laid, stated that he had but one course to pursue, and he could not hesitate to
                perform his duty. The prisoner not having employed counsel, or offered any reasons
                himself why it should not be supposed it was his purpose to violate the law, it only
                remained for him to require WALTER DECLINES PROFFERED AID. 375 a bond with
                sufficient sureties for the maintenance of the peace during the next six months. He
                would therefore fix the sum at, $5,000. Many persons volunteered to become Walter's
                sureties,. and among them were Col. -Oakdale and the editor of the American journal.
                "No, gentlemen," said Walter, firmly. "I thank you; but I must decline your
                kindness. I believe that the position in which I find myself is the result of a
                conspiracy. Many things which have occurred to my mind during the last few minutes,
                induce the conviction that this whole proceeding is in accordance with a
                premeditated- purpose. My name has been used in the papers without any agency on my
                part, and the notoriety attending my presence in this city, has been en- tirely the
                work of others. Those who have been instrumental in bringing me hither, to subserve
                some purpose of their own, must have anticipated the tenders of my friends to become
                my securities in a bond to keep the peace. Now, believing, I say, that this whole
                business is in pursuance of a plot, I am not disposed to co-operate with my enemies
                in the fulfilment of their objects. They have mistaken their man, and the re- sult
                may not be precisely such as they anticipated. I will not give bail. I do not desire
                any friend to be my surety. [ will not even promise to maintain the peace, when I
                meet with any of my enemies." "Then you will have to go to prison," said the
                magistrate. "I did not suppose the prison would have to come to me," replied Walter.
                But I hope your honor will provide me as comfortable an apartment as may be
                consistent with duty." "That must rest with the keeper. I believe he is not hard-
                hearted. But why you can desire to go there, when there is an opportunity to avoid
                the incarceration, surpasses my power of conjecture." "Doubtless it does. If my
                object were apparent, it would cease to be a counter-plot. But no one, I think, will
                attribute my conduct to any unworthy motive. I do not seek protection from the
                assaults of my enemies, else these proceedings, if not extrajudicial, would at least
                be supererogatory." Walter bowed to the officers who had conducted him from the
                hotel, and signified his readiness to repair to the place of confinement. He was
                driven to prison, and upon the representa- tions of the officers, was accommodated

                present at the office of the magistrate, hastened away to the President to announce
                the extraordinary turn the affair had taken. "Gone to prison!" exclaimed the
                President. "What does he mean?" "He declined giving his reasons, sir." "This will
                never do! It will produce such a commotion in the city, and throughout the country,
                as no administration can withstand. We shall be condemned! Sent to prison for

                to the secretary, Boozle, and beg him to come here. Shortly afterwards the secretary
                made his appearance. "Ah! This is a bad business of Winkle's," said the Pres- ident.
                "It would have been better to have had him disposed of in the Senate" " "But he
                would have been confirmed," said the Secretary. X "Our old friend had become so
                partial to the young fellow, that he swore he would vote for him in defiance of
                every thing." "Even that would have been preferable; but why was he assailed in the
                paper " "The paragraph was dictated by Mrs. Fimble herself, and his arrest was her
                stratagem. But she never could have fore- seen that he would go to prison! She

                the Jesuits as she is, I doubt whether she could wantonly afflict the handsome
                fellow whom she seems to delight in having con- tinually at her side, without some
                selfish motive at the bottom of it. Well, I hope you will negotiate me out of the
                difficulty. You have plenary powers, and she has beauty." "I will have him out of

                a plan of liberation. Meantime the excitement in the city grew very intense. An
                American was victimized. The son of a late member of Congress, the author of the
                unique speech against the innova- ting fanatics, the gallant beau, the chivalrous
                descendant of a brave officer, was incarcerated in a vile prison! Every lady who had
                seen him was a sympathizer, and the influence of the ladies is never contemptible at
                the capital. During the day more than a hundred persons called upon the prisoner to
                express their concern, and to offer their services in any way he might see proper to
                command them. But his resolution was not to be shaken, and nothing could induce him
                to comply with the prescribed forms of enfranchisment. At night, not less than a
                dozen sumptuous repasts were sent him, borne by servants in livery, which, after
                appropria- ting to himself the beautiful bouquets that accompanied them, he
                distributed among his fellow-prisoners in the other apart- ments. He had lights,
                books, and a comfortable fire, for one of the keepers was an American. But before he
                hadplunged deeply in- to a volume, Col. Oakdale was announced. Walter threw down the
                book, and grasped the hand of his old friend. "You seem comfortable here, Walter,"
                said the senator, sitting in front of the cheerful fire and looking round. "Quite
                so, colonel. But still it is a prison." "Yes. And I cannot imagine why you will
                persist in re- maining in it, when you might go forth." "It is a stroke of my
                diplomacy, colonel-and you will, I think, in the end, admit it to have been a
                skilful one." "Gad, you have wine here. Who furnishes it? It is good, too," he
                continued, as he drank a glass. "It is excellent. I donot know the generous donor.
                Every hour something of the sort arrives, and from unknown hands." "Flowers, too
                They come from some lady's hand. Virginia must know it! But, Walter, she has a
                dreadful headache to-night, and couldn't go to the party, and that is the reason I
                came to spend the evening with you." "Did she request you to come?" asked the young
                man quickly. "No-not exactly. But when I said I was resolved to come, she seemed

                Why, what the deuce is i the matter with the fellow?" "I have been a fool. And she
                was too hasty." - "Of course you have-of course she was. What else could be
                expected? But I came to tell you of some fine shots I made--" "I could explain every
                thing if she would but hear me--" "Wouldn't she hear you? You know how far it is
                from the old pear tree to the fence--" "She would not see me-and she returned my
                letters." "I'll talk about that when I'm done. It 'was under the pear tree. Dash was
                leaping briskly ahead when he nosed the bird. He paused so suddenly that he turned a

                slandering me." "Pooh! A fit of jealousy. That's all. And no wonder, for she has
                seen you gallanting the handsomest woman in the city." A lady wishes to see you,"
                said the keeper, who opened the door. "Gad, I am by no means positive that
                -Virginia's suspi- cions are groundless," said the colonel. "Then you may be
                convinced," said Walter. I do not know who this lady is, do you, Mr. Keeper?" :' No,
                sir; she is veiled." "Go in to my little closet of a bed-room, colonel, where you
                can see and hear every thing that passes. I am not afraid of any thing being said or
                done, which Virginia herself might not hear and see. Now admit the lady." She was
                ushered in by the keeper, who closed the door after her. Walter, although he was
                just then slightly flushed with the excellent wine that had been sent him, stood
                per- fectly still and gazed in silence at his visitor. "You do not know me 1" said
                the lady, sinking into the chair which the colonel had occupied. THE POWER OF THE

                throwing them off and standing be- fore our hero, but with no trace of levity on her
                face. "Honoria!" exclaimed Walter. "Is it possible?" "It is possible--it was
                inevitable!" said she, again sink- ing upon the chair. "I have come to make a
                confession-to crave your forgiveness, and to--" I am not a father
                confessor-nevertheless I absolve you. I have thought you exercised some control over
                my political fortunes, which have been but a series of disasters. If such has been
                the case, I forgive you. You have but executed the will of others. I had not merited
                your vengeance," "No! You had not! And you have conjectured truly, in regard to the
                will of others. Hear me. I was reared in a convent. I know not where I was born, or
                who were my pa- rents. But for this purpose-to be the instrument of the Jesuits--was
                I educated. I have been taught that in serving them, I serve my God. And I have
                believed it. And they believe that in obtaining power on earth, which they hold and
                exercise in the service of the one whose name they bear, they but perform a
                religious duty. - But they have been granted the privilege of using any means, of
                exercising any power, of violating any rule, in the attainment of the great end in

                hardly credit my statement. Let it suffice that I am made to represent some six
                hundred thousand votes. That is the secret of my influence with the administration.

                signs, which I knew perfectly well. The compact with the party in power is
                unmitigated hostility to the Native Americans as the price of the support of Rome.
                But to resume :-I delayed action in your case. It was not deemed good policy for the
                sdmin- istration, suddenly to break with you and your friends, inas- much as you had
                not, in becoming a Know Nothing, aban- doned any principle of the party you had
                belonged to, and it was known that very many thousands occupied the same posi- tion
                in relation to the head of the government. But the edi- tor of the American paper,
                while protesting he would not as- sail our religion, nor the spiritual ascendency of
                the Pope, nor the power of angels, seemed to redouble his assaults on the

                after as many delays as you would bear with, to have had your name sent to the

                time won the friendship of the kind old gentleman who wields the casting vote, and
                it was apparent you would be confirmed. I knew you would not brook further
                procrastination on the part of the President, and feared you would abandon the
                pursuit, and leave the city. It was my pleasure to keep you here. I knew you would
                demand satis- action of the editor of the paper in which the offensive paragraph
                appeared-and I knew if you fought, whatever might be the result of the meeting, you
                would cease to be a sojourner in Washington. Therefore the marshal was apprised of
                your intentions. But I did not suppose-and no one could have foreseen-that you would
                consent to be incarcerated in a vile prison! The thought was intolerable anguish to

                when the door was thrown open, forgetful of his loss of liberty, our hero would-
                have accompanied the unresisting woman into the street, had he not been gently
                thrust back by the keeper. He bowed, and returned to his chair, as the disappointed
                visitor departed. "Hang me, if you are not the most extraordinary young man that
                ever drew the breath of life!" said the colonel. "When I tell Virginia what I have
                witnessed, if she don't i forgive you, I'll disinherit her! But who did you
                allude'to when you said there was but one who could release you? "I meant Virginia.
                I will confess any thing to you, colonel; I know you will keep my secret, even from
                Virginia, if you cannot be my confederate. You know I could have avoided this
                confinement. My object in coming hither was to excite the sympathy of Virginia."

                on crusts and water." "I should not have thought of that! You are right. Pity is a
                more powerful feeling with the sex than even the desire of excelling in the number
                of their conquests. But I must describe your interview with that angelic Jesuitical
                image." "And do not forget what she said about the anonymous letters. I know not the
                nature of their contents-but I at- tribute Virginia's displeasure to them." "I will

                rejected the proposal of Honoria, and that I vowed my eternal constancy to
                Virginia." "And, merely because he was an American!' I am an American myself-and
                would these papal devils have us for- feit our birthright, or disavow our country,

                immediately, and I will shout in -his ear, that I, too, am an American--and that
                Americans shall rule America! Good night, Walter. Be comfortable, and rely upon me."
                And he departed hastily, as if impelled by the one purpose of con- fronting the
                President, and avowing his nativity. Walter, after quaffing another glass of the
                delicious wine, which had been sent him by his unknown friends, resumed his book,
                which, it may as well be owned, was "Smollet's Pere- grine Pickle," which thelkeeper
                had loaned him. He had not been thus engaged many minutes, before the keeper again
                appeared, bearing in his hand a finely enamelled card. "Boozle!" said Walter, with a
                sneer. "But let him come in." Boozle made his appearance with a sympathizing smile,
                but with astonished glances at the evidences of luxurious living by which the
                prisoner was surrounded. ' I am glad you seem comfortable " said he. I was fearful

                more than that-much annoyed. He has received many indignant letters, and has been
                compelled to listen to some rather threatening speeches, from influential members of
                Congress." "Did you see Colonel Oakdale?" "He was driving furiously towards the
                White House a few minutes ago." "Well, you have sown the wind, you know the rest."
                But, without having to tip any one, you may yet win. This last move of yours has
                taken every body by surprise, j and the high powers are prepared to treat on your
                own terms." "I have no terms to propose." "If you will sign a pledge to support the
                administration, your name will be sent in to-morrow, and you will be con- firmed
                immediately. I am authorized to say so " Q "You remember the words uttered in the
                French Chamber I of Deputies, when the royal family offered terms to the in- censed
                revolutionists. It is too late 1" "Do you mean that you will not accept the office?"
                "I do. The only position I now court is Plastic's. I made him what he-is, and I can
                unntake him. I want nothing from the administration." 'But you must not remain here.
                The President will appoint you without your consent!" "He should have given me the
                appointment when I desired it. I should decline it now, even if it were advised and
                consented to by the Senate. And I would prepare a document for, the press, setting
                forth the history of the entire proceedings in my case, and showing that the
                government is in the hands of the foreigners-the miserable Jesuits-whose entire vote
                is represented here by a woman!" A MYSTERY. 385 "1 She deserves your enmity, but-"
                "I shalltnot say one word in her disparagement. She is a woman, and a most beautiful
                one; eh, Boozle?" "That is incontrovertible. But she has never had a smile for me.
                And you will not accept the office? That is most extraordinary! ' "I believe it is,
                truly. For the post is said to be worth not less than five thousand dollars." "There
                must be some great inducement-some equivalent, which has not been discovered by the
                astute secretary-- "To induce me to decline such an appointment -- And resolve to
                remain in prison! "There must be-there is-but all the mere diplomatists in creation
                could never find it out. And I won't tell what it is. So you-see your mission is not
                likely to be crowned with success. I will say, however, that there is one person-one
                only-who can lead me hence-who must release me, if ever I regain my liberty-and
                neither the President, nor the secretary----" "Nor Honoria?" "Nor Honoria is that
                person i" "Then I cannot conjecture who you mean. But I think you are mistaken. You
                must not remain here." "Must not?" "Must not., The President will order your
                release-will pardon -" "Tell him if he does I'll cane him! I have an invincible
                respect for the President, but none whatever for the man. And when I am punishing
                the individual, I will make a pro- testation of not assaulting the office. Tell him,
                he is warned not to meddle further in my affairs. I will not promise to keep the
                peace, if they discharge me before I am ready to come out-- " ' But what can be your
                motive--" ' That's none of his business, nor yours. I may have a little game of my
                own to play-a private matter, with which you can have no concern, and which I don't
                choose to explain to any one. The President did not send me hither, nor did he
                desire it. That much I will admit. Let him say so in his organ. When I am ready to
                come forth, I will find the requisite sureties. But no pardon. That is suggestive of
                antecedent guilt. I have committed no crime. If he pardons 17 <pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC6922-00000199"/> 386 THE WINKLES.
                me, I shall regard it as an insult. Tell him so. I want to [' see how Peregrine
                conducted himself in his diffiulty. Good ^ night." And Boozle, without being able to
                penetrate the young man's motives, reluctantly withdrew. CHAPTER XXXIII. WALTER
                RECEIVES INTELLIGENCE FROM HOME.-THE PRISON I DIPLOMACY QUITE PROSPEROUS. WALTER
                never slept more soundly, or enjoyed more pleasant dreams, than he did in prison.
                And he had an excellent i appetite for breakfast, which was damaged, however, by the
                contents of the letters and papers brought in by his keeper. i The first letter he
                tore open, was from his sister. Lucy informed him of the occurrences in New York, a
                portion of i which, she admitted, she had intended to keep to herself, for the
                present, but was forestalled by the papers, copies of which she sent him. How the
                reporters ascertained she was to become the Countess of Hilton, she was unable to
                conjecture-and, she owned, she could not contradict it! But, she had very great
                fears, her dear brother might never consent to the arrangement, and would regard the
                fact of Edmund's being a foreigner, an insuperable obstacle. She said she had in-
                timated as much to the earl; but he had undertaken to prove that such a consummation
                of his wishes, would be no infringe- ment of Walter's rule, inasmuch as he would not
                seek to exercise the rights of suffrage-; and, instead of becoming a naturalized
                citizen, he merely-" merely" said she-intended to relieve the country of the burden
                of maintaining one of its natives. "He used other arguments," continued Lucy- "which
                I will not repeat; and concluded, by assuring me most seriously, and eloquently,
                that the 'Know Nothings' never admitted the ladies into their councils." She acknow-
                ledged the receipt of Walter's letter, which had been trans- mitted by her mother,
                informing her of his present extra- ordinary situation; and she predicted that
                Virginia would not hold out long against such a siege, "ETTER FROM HOME. 387 Walter
                found a whole column in one of the papers devoted to a description of the company at
                Mrs. Laurel's party, and embracing the most minute details of the dress of the Coun-
                tess, as well as the appearance of the Earl, who was designa- ted as a most
                unassuming, well-bred young man. Lucy, herself, seemed to have attracted a large
                share of the reporter's atten- tion; and of course there was enough said in her
                praise to have turned the heads of all the Arums and Crudles in the world. The A.'s
                and C.'s, however, were duly mentioned, for they were reported to be very rich, and
                beautiful, and all that. No allusion whatever was made to the duel of Col. Ball.
                Even the fact of his presence on the occasion of the great re- ception, was entirely
                suppressed. There was also a letter from Sergeant Blore. He urged Walter to return
                as soon as possible, that he might take his final leave of his uncle, who was
                sinking by inches into the grave under the tortures of Griselda. He said thq
                commander was dying of a sort of torpor, brought on, he thought, by wearing damp
                undershirts, which his wife had regularly sprinkled for that purpose. She had lately
                gone to mass, and was turning Roman Catholic. "We thought she was religious enough
                before," said the sergeant; "but she is worse now, and we are put upon half rations
                every Friday! - No meat-no grog! And she's made your uncle make a new will, and sign
                it. Bawson says it makes no odds, as he has another for your benefit, ready cut and
                dried, which your uncle has promised to sign before he kicks the bucket. The lawyer
                says the last will is the one that will win the battle. Your uncle says he will give
                him the wink when he feels himself going, so that it can be produced and signed. But
                he wants to see you and Lucy, before he sets out on the final campaign. There is no
                hope for him. He says so himself. And a sure sign of it is the presence of a dark,
                tall, gaunt priest, named Xavier, or Zebra, or something of the sort. After this
                business is over, Bawson is going to blow Roland sky high, and play the devil with
                him. Mrs. E. attempted to storm the fort once, but my guns were in readiness, and
                double-shotted. I don't like to venture in town to get your mother to send the
                news-so I send this to the office by Bill Dizzle. Come, soon,-your un- cle can't
                hold out much longer-but he says he'll be-- if that Jesuitess shall have his money.
                And when the priest holds up his black cross before him, he tells him to go and <pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC6922-00000200"/>

                fight for the infidel Arabs. Oh, Walter-he grows eloquent on that subject, and says,
                if he had his will, the Ma- hometans should be driven out of Europe, and that the
                holy land should be put in cultivation, and manured with the blood of the Moslems,
                instead of wasting Christian- lives fighting under the new moon flag of the
                barbarians. No more-but come soon. Your faithful friend, THOMAS BLORE." There was
                likewise a note from Honoria, imploring Walter not to divulge her'secret, unless he
                desired to hear of her death. That he threw into the fire, and then he looked over
                the papers from Philadelphia and Baltimore, and perceived that his imprisonment had
                been duly chronicled. Some of the letter writers said he was confined in prison
                because he could not give security for his good behavior; others that he would not,
                from prudentialmotives, as the prison walls afforded what he most desired, viz.,
                protection from assault; and others again, denying the correctness of the rest,
                intimated that he voluntarily remained a captive for some purpose which was a
                profound mystery to the outsiders. But that the President had proffered to release
                him, and also to confer on him the i office he had applied for; and- both of which
                had been re- jected. It was stated, however, that-he had almost as many visitors at
                his prison as the President had at his palace, and the sympathies of the ladies were
                very generally enlisted in his behalf. Thus Walter perceived he was rapidly becoming
                a famous character, and his resolution not to relinquish the advantages of his
                position without reaping some decided benefit, and ter- minating his incarceration
                with eclat, was more and more con- firmed. During the forenoon the colonel drove up
                to the door of the prison in a great perturbation. "I have but a minute to stay,
                Walter, " said he, "I must be in my place in the Senate. I am going to break ground
                against the administration. I shall vote against all the nomi- nations; I'll reject
                the treaties, I'll call for correspondences, I'll have a committee to investigate
                the disbursements on con- tracts, printing, and advertising. I'm in the opposition
                now 1" "Why, what's the matter, colonel?" "I have just listened to the whole
                programme at the Pres- NEWS FROM VIRGINIA. ' 389 ident's. They construed my silence
                into an acquiescence, and made most unreserved and iniquitous revelations. That wo-
                man spoke truly! They are bargaining with the foreigners! Henceforth I am in the
                opposition! "But, colonel, I hope you will not make any sacrifices on my account!"
                You shall have Virginia! You shall be revenged. Only be composed and comfortable."
                "But, sir, you have not told me what she---" "Another time, Walter; I'm in great
                haste now." "One moment, colonel! you didn't finish telling about the shot near the
                pear-tree." "Oh, true i" said the colonel, sitting down. "Dash went heels over head.
                I could see nothing. The dog wouldn't move. I walked all around. No bird. Then I
                approached the dog in front, and at last espied the partridge lying in the sunken
                print of a horse's hoof, and not four feet from the dog's nose. I stood a long
                time-but he did not seem willing to rise. So I stepped forward and kicked him up. I
                was afraid of tearing him to pieces; and waited until he was as far as the fence,
                before I fired. Then I saw no more of him; but Dash kept looking straight up in the
                air, while I looked like a fool. Presently down came the bird on my head-on my head,
                sir, knocking my hat over my eyes. I had shot him in the head, and he had sailed up
                perpendicularly until quite dead." "Capital! But, colonel;pray tell me what took
                place last night after you left me." "I went home. Virginia did not open her lips,
                yet she begged most eloquently to be informed of your condition, and so forth. She
                was ever at my side, with her head laid against my shoulder, and her ear open. She
                was ve'ry affectionate. I knew what she meant, and was just going to tell her every
                thing, when I received a note from the Secretary of State, ask- ing me to meet him
                at the house of the Secretary of the Treasury.. I went thither, and beheld a great
                party. The beautiful Honoria was present. Tell me, you rogue, if your conduct was
                not circumscribed by the consciousness of my presence?" "I own I did not forget you
                were a witness, colonel." "I thought so--for flesh and blood -- "But, sir, she did
                not know it." "Very true-and you made a final disposition of her. <pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC6922-00000201"/>
                390 THE WINKLES. Virginia will love you now more than ever. She was at the
                Secretary's-I mean this Jesuit woman, and she was the gay- est person there, angling
                for the Native American editor, who was there too. I went with the secretary to see
                the Preoi.- dent. We were joined by one Boozle) who whispered some. I thing, and
                then the President said he was unwell and begged us to call in the morning. This
                morning they lifted the cur- tain, and exposed all their measures, and purposes. A
                very t ugly picture, sir! I denounced the whole programme. Be patient. When I have
                declared war against them I will re- turn and get you out of prison. But I learn the
                penalty in the bond is to be doubled, on the suggestion of that Boozle -that is
                $10,000, instead of $5,000. No matter, you shall come out." "No colonel-not until
                Virginia says so-and, moreover, until she is reconciled--" "I forgot that! But she
                shall be satisfied. I will see her before I return. Good morning." Walter's next
                visitor was his old college friend, George Parke. "Hallo, old fellow!" cried Parke,
                running up to our i hero and shaking him heartily by the hand. I was on my i way
                home, having quarrelled with our professor on political economy, when I chanced to
                see your affair in a paper. Now I shall stay until you are out of this scrape. I am
                rich now, Walter, and owe you money. Not a word. I learned from the keeper where the
                magistrate's office is. I'll get you out! in an hour, and after that we'll see if we
                can't contrive to have a shot at the editor.'" "No, George. You shall do no such
                thing. To be can- did with you, I remain here very willingly, and with a design
                -which I will explain. Virginia is in the city, and is offend- ed with me. I have
                been slandered. You know how power- fully one's sufferings in a prison will work
                upon the sympathies of a tender-hearted girl. You understand? She alone must.
                release me." "I see! A capital idea! But you don't seem to be suf- fering much."
                "No. But she is not to know how comfortable I am. Sit down and tell me the
                particulas of your quarrel." "I had passed my examination, and thought my diploma
                secured. Mr.-- was the last questioner. I satisfied him, THE BLACK MARIA. 391 and
                was in high spirits, which he observed, and he interrogated me as to the cause of
                it. I told him. My mother had just sent me a power of attorney to draw on her agent
                in New York for the proceeds of our crop of cotton shipped from that port. It
                amounted to $21,00O! Mr.-- then began to de- nounce our Southern institutions, and
                of course I was not just then inclined to agree with him. He fired a -broadside of
                his European dogmas at my country, and I fired back at him. I controverted all his
                propositions, and we arrived at different results. At length he grew seriously
                excited, and demanded if that country was not in a higher state of prosperity whose
                square mile-the exact dimensions of my mother's plantation -was divided among forty
                small proprietors, and produced a clear revenue of $40,000, than the one whose
                square mile had but one proprietor and yielded only $20,000. I did not deny that the
                first country might be theoretically the most prosperous, according to the interests
                of monarchies; but I insisted upon preferring the whole mile in our own country, and
                most vehemently asserted that the sole proprietor of the mile was in a better
                condition than each of the forty. Ho grew furious-I remained firm. He insulted me,
                and I cursed him. Of course I got no diploma-as you got no com- mission. But who
                have we here?" The keeper opened the door and said there was a queer sort of a noisy
                fellow without, who demanded admission to Walter's room. "Did he come in a
                carriage?" asked Walter. "Yes. In the Black Maria-the prison carriage. He was taken
                up for disturbing the peace." "And he says he knows me?" "Yes. And he knows
                Shakspeare too, for he quotes him by the page." "Then admit him!" "Yes," said Parke,
                "the man who quotes Shakspeare from inclination is fit associate for the immortals."
                The singular individual was pushed through the door. He stood in silent abstraction,
                while the young men scruti- nized his exterior. He was covered with stains of mud,
                as if he had been lying in a gutter. His hat was crushed in on one side, and the
                crown, torn out three fourths of the way round, hung pendant in front. His
                pantaloons were stuffed in his K - . <pb n="392-393" xml:id="VAC6922-00000202"/> 392 THE WINKLES. boots. His coat was
                buttoned up to his chin, and his hands were crossed behind him. "Look up, my
                friend," said Walter. "Friend! at that word I lift my eyes!" Pollen!" cried both the
                young men at once, rushing for. ward and seizing the poet's hands. "Yes, Pollen the
                poet. Let me eat-and remove the bot- tles-before we have any questions." He helped
                himself iA without ceremony to the remains of the sumptuous breakfast I left by
                Walter. "Now," said he, "I will give you some ac- count of myself. A week ago I was
                in New York, at the topmost round of the poetical ladder. The Countess of Hill- ton
                was my patroness, and advanced me money to publish a new edition of my works. But I
                had forgotten that my port-!' folio and copyrights were in pledge to the cormorant
                Jew in i Philadelphia for the pitiful sum of $200. I went thither to redeem
                them---but the interest had accumulated to such a goemetrical absurdity that it
                required all my funds to satisfy the smiling rascal. I redeemed them, however. "Not
                knowing what else to do, I applied to Mr. Bell for a ' : pitiful office. He was
                anxious to accommodate me. He said : he appreciated my merits and reverenced my
                genius. But all :X his appointments had to be submitted to the secretary for his
                approval.' He advised me to come hither and see the head of the Department, and he
                advanced me the money to defray my expenses. "When I arrived at my hotel this
                morning, the first name I heard mentioned was yours, Walter. I learned what had
                transpired, and I hastened away to the President's to demand your discharge. Upon
                entering the portal, I was thrust back by an impudent Paddy, who demanded my name
                and business! I told him I was one of the sovereigns, and that the. President was
                the servant of the people-and I came in the right of a master. He damned me as one
                of the natives, and seizing my collar, dragged me out in the rain. I splintered my
                cane over his head. But that did not move him. I then aimed a blow at his nose,
                which he resented. I don't know exactly how many times he struck me, nor precisely
                where; but I awoke to consciousness, lying in the gutter, where the turbid water was
                dashing over me. An officer was called, who con- ducted me hither. This is the whole
                of my story." "Merciful heaven!" cried Walter. "And has it come to POLLEN SHRTLESS
                AGAIN. 393 this, that in our great country, the boasted land of freedom, the native
                citizen is thrust away from the portals of the public offices by the mere
                offscourings of all the monarchies of the earth! Shall the Irish and the Dutch hold

                to loan me?" asked Pollen. "Yes, you shall share my wardrobe, as you have partaken
                of my crust." "I have eaten the half of a broiled chicken, and begin to feel
                comfortable!" "A lady, sir!" said the keeper, peeping in. "A lady!" said Parke.
                "Then we are de trope." "And I am in a vile costume," said the poet. "But there is a
                closet. I'll retire--" "No!" said Walter. "It may be the very thing for you to be
                seen thus. If it should be Virginia or Honoria---" "Miss Wilsome Winkle!" said the
                keeper, admitting Walter's aunt. "Oh, Walter! I forgive you for attending your
                uncle's wedding! Come to my arms, my poor, poor boy " She ran to him, and embraced
                him most affectionately. '"And these are your fellow-prisoners--your vile compan-
                ions-the low associates they have thrust you among." "No-aunt! Do you not recognize
                my friends?" "Where's my glass! Oh! Mr. Parke! I beg pardon, sir. And, mercy on me!
                Is it possible! What! Are you-you are! It is Mr. Pollen-and in this plight! It is a
                shame! Here, Walter, I've brought you a check. Send the keeper to a clothing
                stored--have every thing brought here, and furnish him with decent clothing. Lose no
                time." Walter took the check. And while his aunt sat at the table, saturating her
                handkerchief with tears, he opened his trunk, and furnished the poet with a suit of
                his own clothing. Thus arrayed, Pollen was himself again, and made a very genteel
                appearance.. "What a shame!" repeated Wilsome, after she had made Pollen relate the
                manner of his being sent to prison. "And to be thrust away from the President's door
                by a nasty for- eigner! It was worse than your case, Walter, which I read in the
                Ledger this morning." A great deal worse!" said Walter. "Mine is a voluntary

                could not see any reason or sense in remaining in such a 1 place, where one had the
                option of going out of it." Walter explained every thing; and his speech was sue. f
                ceeded by hearty bursts of laughter. "You are an ingenious rogue, Walter; and I
                heartily for. give you. And you will be certain to succeed, since you see t your

                transpired with Honoria. "Still it was a pity," said his aunt, that you did not j
                convert that poor creature from Jesuitism. You might have done it." ! "But not
                without danger of losing Virginia," said Parke. "I'm glad it is no worse, "said
                Wilsome. Heigho! But this is a tiresome place! Walter, there are just four of
                us-clear away the things from the table, and let us have a sociable game of whist."
                "We should be interrupted, aunt. And it might get! into the papers." It might so!
                And I could no bear to have curious persons casting their vulgar looks at us.
                Suppose, then, Igo to Virginia, and lament over your sad condition?" "That will do!"
                cried Walter. "Don't ask any thing, aunt-no concession--or she will suspect us, and
                tear our scheme to tatters." "I'll take your company along with me, we may want a
                game -" VIRGINIA INTERCEDES. 395 "You may have the poet, but not George. I won't
                trust him!" "And I won't trust myself! said Parke. But if the ne- gotiation should
                finally fail, then there will be a clear field for me." Miss Wilsome, taking Pollen
                with her, proceeded to the boarding house, where She found Virginia in tears. Her
                father was with her, having returned from the capitol, and had just completed the
                recital of the sufferings of our hero, and a description of his extraordinary
                interview with Hono- ria. "Oh, dear, good Miss Wilsome," cried Virginia, throwing
                her arms around the old lady, " won't you go with my father and get him out of
                prison?" "Why should we take all that trouble!" was the reply, "when he declares he
                has no desire to live any longer " "No desire to live any-longer?" "No, none at all.
                And he says it is a matter of perfect indifference whether he dies in a prison or a
                palace." "It is cruel to talk thus! I have explained to papa why I was offended! Any
                one would have come to' the same conclu- sion I did,.upon the same information.
                Nowif it be true, that my displeasure is the cause of his misery, you may assure him
                it exists no longer! Now do not delay in obtaining his release." "There will be no
                delay!" said the poet. "I can assure you, Miss Oakdale, that Walter has acted with
                the strictest propriety and honor, as it regards this Mrs. Fimble." "I am convinced
                of it. Do urge my father and Miss Wilsome to lose no time in taking him out of that
                vile prison I Go to him, Mr. Pollen, and say I shall be happy to see him at the
                earliest possible moment. And pardon my se eming boldness sir-but, you know when a

                repaired to the magistrate and obtained Walter's release. The poet and George Parke

                appear before his appeased mistiess. Upon hearing the bell Virginia ran into the
                hall. Walter caught her in his arms and seized a kiss before she could utter an
                objection f! "Well, that business is settled," said the colonel-" it was done on the
                wing, and Walter is a good shot. Now I will return to the Senate chamber, and give
                Mr. Ralph Ro- land his quietus." "Ralph Roland!" said Walter, looking up from
                Virginia's blushing face, which had been nestling against his side. "Yes. He has
                been appointed consul to London, and upon the recommendation of the ubiquitous
                Father Xavier; but as one of the Senate, I do not consent to it. Take care of
                yourselves until I return." The colonel hastened away to the capitol, and the loers
                joined Miss Wilsome in the parlor. "He does not look very pale," said Virginia.

                "I saw her at the ' party; and I never beheld a more perfect f orm, or more lovely
                features. I am sure I was not to blame," she continued : archly, to Walter, " for
                giving you up as lost." [ "But to think that when she was so lavish of her gra-
                cious smiles, she was plotting my defeat, and planning my confinement in prison! She
                is too dangerous an instrument ever to make an agreeable wife." "And to pass for a
                married woman!" said his aunt, con- temptously. "She must be an unprincipled
                creature!" "Tndoubtedly, " said Walter. "And I have warned both Parke and Pollen to
                beware of her." "I hope neither of them will seek her acquaintance," said Wilsome.
                "If they do, I shall banish them from my sight for ever." "I am sorry you did not
                intimate -your wishes sooner, aunt; but it is too late now. The poet is resolved to

                him where she placed Walter. There he may die " "Mercy on me!" said Virginia, aside
                to Walter," I'm afraid she loves him " "By what symptom do you judge?" asked he,
                signifi- cantly. ' And that Southern goat " continued Miss Wilsome no doubt he
                proposed it! I hope they may be punished to their heart's content! They are a couple
                of young, silly, headstrong fools." A servant came in and announced that a
                gentleman, whose name was not given, desired to see Walter in the hall. "I can't
                leave Virginia so soon," said Walter. "If he has the appearance of a gentleman
                conduct him hither." He did have the appearance of a gentleman, and he came in. He
                said his friend Pollen had given him the number of the house where Walter could be
                found, and he was very happy to meet with him. After staring at him a few moments
                Walter sprung up and shook him heartily by the hand. It was Mr. Glass, the actor,
                whose acquaintance Walter had made at the the police station. Mr. Glass informed his
                young friend that his daughter Delia ,had escaped the persecutions of Roland by
                drawing a dagger in her own defence. She had then, under an assumed name, acted in
                one of the Metropolitan theatres, and acquired some experience. but not much
                celebrity. But, acting upon the advice of Mr. Lowe, who subsequently became the Earl
                of Hilton, and bearing with them a letter from him, they had appeared upon the
                London boards, where they achieved deci- *ded success. And now his Delia, the actor
                continued with grateful tears in his eyes, was a star of the first magnitude, and
                overwhelmed with offers of advantageous. engagements. Mr. Glass then said his
                daughter would soon appear in Wash- ington, and he hoped Walter and his friends
                would honor her with their presence. <pb n="398-399" xml:id="VAC6922-00000205"/> 398 THE WINKLES. CHAPTER XXXIV. WALTER
                RETURNS WITH VIRGINIA AND HS AUNT TO PHLA. DELPHA. COLONEL OAKDALE was in high
                spirits. His casting vote had ; defeated Roland's nomination; and the prominent men
                in the opposition waited upon him at his boarding-house to felicitate him upon his
                successful demonstration. They desired like. wise to make the acquaintance of Walter
                and Virginia; for the colonel had, in a confidential way, made known to his friends
                that the secret of the young man's persistence in re- maining in prison might find a
                solution in the approaching nup. tials of his daughter. Hence there was a gay and
                brilliant company that night assembled in the parlors of the boarding-house on F
                street. The colonel's quarrel with the President was the theme of con. versation in
                all the political circles; and whenever it was men. tioned, it was likewise repeated
                that his daughter was to be espoused by Walter Winkle, the brave young man who had
                been imprisoned for an attempt to resent an insult. While among the initiated it was
                understood that our hero, at the moment of disaster, had the address to retrieve his
                fortune by I an original conception of the mind, which would never have occurred to
                any one not gifted with some degree of genius. Therefore the parlors where our party
                sojourned were e crowded with a constant succession of visitors. And so many notes
                of congratulation, written on scented paper, were received by Walter, from unknown
                friends, that Virginia really became alarmed, and begged her father to permit her to
                return with Miss Wilsome to Philadelphia the next day. Walter sanctioned the
                proposition; and exhibiting the letter from Sergeant Blore, declared his intention
                of setting out for home the next morning. The next day there was rejoicing among
                certain persons in j Washington when it was reported that young Winkle had left the
                city, and did not intend to make any pause at Bladensburg. L The magistrate was
                greatly relieved by the intelligence, for he j had received a message from the White
                House to the effect that the young lion was to be kept caged until he became per-
                fectly docile. " RETURN TO PHLADELPHA. 399 Arrived at Philadelphia, Walter conducted
                Virginia to her aunt Nitre's. "I am so rejoiced!" exclaimed Mrs. N., when she came
                in- to the parlor, where our loving couple were laughing over the recent events at
                Washington, and particularly at the proposi- tion of Miss Wilsome to have a game in
                prison. "Yes, I am happy to see you both safely back again. Washington is a terrible
                place. Never go there any more, Walter!" "I must go when they elect me to Congress,"
                said Wal- ter. "But you are not to be a candidate, unless you pledge yourself never
                to fight a duel," said Virginia. "Recollect your promise." "I recollect it-and will
                observe it. I promised never to send another challenge." ' Nor must you accept one."
                "Come in, doctor!" cried Mrs. N., hearing her husband descending the stairs. ' Here
                are none but friends." The doctor entered, and evinced the satisfaction he felt at
                seeing the young people reconciled to each other, and safely re- turned from
                Washington. "I wanted the doctor to post off to Washington," said Mrs. N., "as soon
                as I saw the horrible paper; but he wouldn't! Men have no feeling. He said his
                business would suffer; I told him he had made money enough. He said his patients
                would die; I told him he might save Walter's life. All would not do. Men have no
                feeling, Walter." "Excuse me, madam," said Walter, indignant at hear- ing Mrs. N.
                always abusing her husband, and one of the best husbands in the world-" but I think
                the doctor did perfectly right. He could have done me no service, I am sure. There
                were an abundance of friends who were willing to be my sure- ties and release me
                from confinement--but 1-" "Upon my word," said Virginia, " it has never yet been
                satisfactorily explained to me why you remained in prison when you could have walked
                out." "It is a long tale," said Walter. "But I was indifferent to my fate unless
                restored-you know. I will tell you every thing some day. I must bid you adieu, now,
                until I return from Babbleton " "No, no!" exclaimed Mrs. N. "You don't know what the

                mother and my uncle, you may corn- mand me. Till then, adieu." After lingering a

                him to come out. Blore, after a A hasty reconnoissance from the door ventured forth,

                by taking the sergeant's hand between both of his, and shaking it heartily.. "How is
                my uncle?" was Walter's first question. "In great danger of being taken," said the
                sergeant. : "Danger of being taken?" "Yes, he is surrounded and undermined, and
                would not I have held out this long, if it hadn't been for Bawson, who is a spy in

                health?" "Worse and worse. Every dhay the doctor comes and says he's no better. Then
                what does he come for? Why, to kill him! And the sheepskin-faced priest is there,

                you would carry with you a long hickory switch-- " "I tried it.-You might as well
                cut a shadow. The devil is in her, you may rely upon it. She's nothing but a shadow
                herself, a mere skeleton-a bundle of bones tied up in a bag of skin. But she has the
                voice of a volcano, and the strength of a roaring lion. I have her stripes on my
                body I She's gone in -- her! And now we are safe." But Mrs. Edwards had caught a
                glimpse of the sergeant as she was closing the door, and immediately re-opened it.
                "The she-devil saw me through the door " said the sergeant. "I'll run in here, and
                enter by the back way." He dodged into the yard through a small gate he found open,
                which he closed and bolted behind him. Walter stumbled over the leaping and barking
                Dew at the door, and the next moment was embraced by his mother and sister. "Lucy!"
                said he, after they were seated in the parlor, "you cannot know how much you have
                improved in ap- pearance " "That is precisely what I have been saying," said Mrs.
                Winkle. "She is the most lovely creature I ever saw!" continued Walter. "Lowe shall
                not have her, unless he stays----" "Such language-even from us-" said Mrs. W. "makes
                the poor child blush, although she knows it is not flattery. What you say about Mr.
                Lowe, Walter--" "Is Walter's nonsense!" said Lucy. "He knows he is opposed to
                foreigners exercising any rights in this country." "Rites, you mean, eh? ' ' No
                matter-I don't belong to your party-you Know Nothing---" "We'll see! But--" <pb n="402-403" xml:id="VAC6922-00000207"/>
                402 THE WINKLES. "Who's there, Biddy ." asked Mrs. W. of the maid who appeared at
                the door. "Dill Bizzle, mam." "She will never learn his name," said Lucy, as often
                as she repeats it. Well, what does Bill want? "He's brung two ducks and a pike,
                which he begs with his comp'ments for you except." "No," said Walter--"Bill must be
                paid. I'm rich. Give him that, Biddy. "He sent Bill a quarter eagle." : "And pray
                how did you become rich?" asked Mrs. W. Walter informed his mother and sister of his
                reconcilia. tion with his Aunt Wilsome, who had given him a check for $500, and he
                had drawn the money that morning. He told them, moreover, that his aunt would be at
                his wedding. "Your wedding!" said Lucy. Yes, and yours. She sanctions both matches,
                and says she knew Lowe was a gentleman. She shed tears when she saw me in prison." A
                "Wilsome never-does any thing by halves," said Mrs. W., i "her heart melted when
                your father died, and it was with X difficulty I could prevent her from bestowing
                her fortune on me, although neither of us knew the embarrassed condition of i her
                brother's estate." . "And she has forgiven Uncle Napoleon," added Walter. - "She
                believes he will not survive long, and is ready to see him whenever he desires it. I
                must hasten to his side, and you must accompany me, Lucy, for if the sergeant's tale
                be true, he is in a dangerous condition." "You must wait until John Dowly comes,"
                said Mrs. [ Winkle. "He will be here soon, and then you can use his gig." "I love
                him!" said both Walter and Lucy, for they had i? been informed of his acts of
                generosity. "Now tell me about the Arums and Crudles," said l Walter. - X Lucy gave
                him all the information she could in relation to them, including the most recent
                conquest of Bell, which was a tufted cornet-a-piston player, belonging to the
                orchestra of the circus. He had passed himself as a French count, and so adroitly
                did he play his part, that he absolutely led Miss Arum to the altar----- "To the
                altar!" exclaimed Walter. JOHN DOWLY. 403 "To the altar!" repeated Lucy. "But when
                the priest-- a Jesuit, for the count of course was a foreigner-- ". "Of course!"
                said Walter. "When he called upon the witnesses, if any of them knew any impediment,
                to come forward, one did step forward--" 'Indeed?" Yes, indeed. It was the noble old
                Col. Ball, and with a blow of his cane, he felled the impostor " "Capital!" "He then
                whispered in Bell's ear that the fellow was a circus cornet-a-piston player, on a
                salary of four dollars a week!" "What did poor Bell say?" "Nothing. She grasped the
                colonePs proffered arm and hastened out of the church!" "But what did the priest
                say?" "Oh, he was furious. The colonel gave him his card, and said he should be
                happy to have the pleasure of shooting him through the body the next morning at
                Hoboken. And if he could not conveniently or consistently meet him himself, he might
                send a substitute, or a dozen of them, and he would fight them all. And I learned
                afterwards that the colonel did promenade the bank for an hour the next day, but no
                antago- nist sought him." "After that, I suppose the girls beat a retreat from the
                city?" "Oh, yes. They are here, now. And Susan is in love with your friend George
                Parke. She believes he will come for her some day, and she is determined to wait for
                him. Yonder is the old gig! . They ran to the window and saw old John Dowly descend
                from his vehicle. He left his gentle horse unfastened, know- ing he could not be
                made to run away, and then knocked very gravely at the door, as he used to do before
                bells were in general use. Lucy was the first to meet the old gentleman, and she
                threw her arms round his neck and kissed him! "My beautiful, lovely child!" said the
                old man, manifest- ing his delight through his tears. "This is the happiest moment
                of my life!" "You have been our benefactor-our protector-the friend of the widow and
                her orphans I " said Walter. <pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC6922-00000208"/> 404 THE WINKLES. I had none of my own-I had
                none of my own-!" "No widow of his own 1 " said the widow, smiling. "I am so happy I
                don't know what I say " replied the 1 old bachelor. "'But I have endeavored to do
                what I felt to be right, and I shall never regret it." "No, Mr. Dowly!" said Walter.
                "You will never re- gret it. Your Maker will reward you, if we should never be able
                to do so." "Don't say a word about reward! If you knew what dreams I have every
                night, you would say I have been already 1 repaid a thousand fold. I am rich. I have
                quietly been ac- cumulating wealth for many years-not as a selfish and miserable
                miser, as some in the city suspected-but for a good purpose. And now my object is
                accomplished. Lucy I shall have a dowry worthy a countess!" "Mr. Dowly " cried Mrs.
                Winkle. "She shall! I say she shall! On the day of her mar- riage she shall place in
                her noble husband's hand-I mean noble in heart, for I know him well, and have known
                him long-sterling bills for 50,00O!" "Are you not raving, Mr. Dowly?" asked Walter.
                "You'll see! and the remainder of my fortune--. i "What? will there be any left?"
                asked Mrs. Winkle. "Shall go to-no matter. But this, I may say: a certain j mortgage
                for $10,000 has been conveyed to a certain young lady, loved by a certain young
                gentleman, of my acquaintance. It is recorded in the clerk's office." "And will you
                not be a beggar yourself?" asked Lucy, while she pressed the old gentleman's hand to
                her lips. "So far from it, I intend to build a new house, and live more elegantly
                than I have donehitherto. And I shall begin anew this very day, to enjoy the
                bounties which my Maker has bestowed upon us for our comfort and happiness. I will
                dine here, and drink a cheerful glass of wine, and talk over old matters with your
                mother, if she will permit me." "Permit you!" said Lucy-and the tears gushed from
                her eyes. "God bless you, John Dowly I " said the widow--" and may he forgive me, if
                I did wrong in rejecting so generous a heart--" "Tut-tut! Not a word about that!
                Better as it is! I A VISIT TO NAPOLEON. 405 never could have been so happy. I am now
                brother, uncle, father-Bless my life! What a scene " He had turned his face towards
                the window, where he beheld Mrs. Edwards leading Sergeant Blore by the ear, an
                unresisting captive. "I'll rescue Blore, or die in the attempt!" said Walter. And he
                rushed into the street and reprimanded the woman in terms of indignation. "He is my
                usband, please sir," said Mrs. E., relinquishing Blore's ear, ' hand hit his a most
                hextrahordinary thing hif I can't harrest my hown desarter ." "Go in, Mrs. Edwards,"
                said Walter. "Hide your head in shame, for you were the first to abandon your
                conjugal partner. You married again while he remained true. You have no just claim
                upon him now. If you create any disturb. ance in the street, I shall have you
                arrested." "Thank you, Walter!" said Blore, when Mrs. Edwards had vanished. She
                wants my money-but you shall have it " , "Not I. Keep it for your declining years.
                But do not let this woman distress you any more. If she again assaults you, let me
                know it." "I will. If she was only a man, I would call her out and settle with
                pistols. I don't know what would have happened if she had got me in the house! Such
                creatures are made to punish us for our sins! Sometimes I think I will blow out my
                brains, and give her the slip that way. But after that, who knows if I wouldn't some
                day meet her again?" "You must not have any such thoughts, sergeant. I will ask her
                master to send her home to England." " If he does that, I shall be a happy man. Now
                I must go to your uncle. I would have been half way there now if she hadn't waylaid
                me." "I shall follow you soon. Tell him so. And Lucy will accompany ie." Blore
                hurried away under cover of Walter's protection, though casting an occasional glance
                behind until he was out of sight. Shortly afterwards, Walter and Lucy drove out
                towards Mr. Napoleon Winkle's country mansion in Mr. Dowly's old gig. As the gentle
                horse moved along at his accustomed easy pace, Lucy, after exacting a promise from
                her brother not to <pb n="406-407" xml:id="VAC6922-00000209"/> 406 THE WINKLES. use any violence, related the manner of
                Roland's stratagem X to inveigle her into a clandestine marriage, and all his subse-
                quent annoyances. Walter, with quivering limbs and a pale brow, said he would not
                violate his pledge; but that if he i were not so restrained, he should certainly
                chastise the villain - with the utmost severity. When they arrived in front of the
                stately old mansion, the industrious Bill Dizzle was already there in readiness to
                open O;t the gate. Walter thanked him for his attention, and knowing ; i that he
                could bestow no greater pleasure on the frog-hunter than to employ his services,
                threw him the reins when they descended, and requested him to drive back to the
                village and leave the vehicle at his mother's door, and to thank Mr. Dowly in his
                name for the use of it. Bill soon made the old! horse strike into a brisker gait
                than the one he had been ac- : customed to. Walter and Lucy passed through a file of
                Griselda's star.! ing servants, and mounted the great stairway leading towards Ad
                their uncle's chamber. They entered, and beheld Father Xavier and Griselda standing
                at the fire-place, one at each ] corner of the mantelpiece, with their eyes
                immovably fixed on the bed, where the patient was lying. Sergeant Blore wasa seated
                near his friend, holding one of his hands. Mr. Winkle lay on his back with his eyes
                closed. "Is he asleep?" asked Walter, in a whisper. Oh, my dear uncle!" said Lucy,
                in a voice of distress. "Hush I Make no noise!" said Griselda, coming for- ward, and
                nodding gravely to the visitors. Father Xavier muttered a benediction in Latin. How
                do you feel, uncle?" asked Walter, seeing the pa- tient remove his hand, which Blore
                had been holding, and silently grasp his own. Walter, in obedience to the patient's
                wish, as indicated by his motion, bent down his ear. "I am better," whispered he.
                Walter could not repress a smile, which Lucy's quick eyes detected, and her heart
                beat less violeitly. - "My uncle desires every one to leave the room," sai Walter,
                in a voice of. command, "but my sister and myself." After lingering a moment,
                Griselda followed the priest out of the room; and Blore, comprehending Walter's
                significant nod, joined the retiring party, and prevented them from lis- tening at
                the key-hole. FEIGNED SICKNESS. 407 The old gentleman, with eyes wide open, rose up
                on his elbow, and listened to the departing footsteps; and when Wal- ter turned the
                key, he sat upright in bed, with a broad smile on his face. "/ I am glad. uncle-"
                began Lucy. "Hush!" said he. "Wait a moment!" "I do not see why you should be in
                such dread of them," said Walter. ' Wait till you are married!" saidahis uncle. "But
                are you not ill?" asked Lucy. "No! My health is perfect. It is a mere stratagems You
                shall know all. Even Bloro is ignorant of my condition and purpose. He might hold
                his tongue, but his face speaks his feelings, and would betray the secret. Dr.
                Prangle has been my only confederate." "But why should yoube reduced to the
                necessity of re. sorting to such expedients?" asked Lucy. "Because I have a Tartar
                for my wife; an instrument of the Jesuits, with the whole inquisition at her back.-
                I was a prisoner in effect. I could not live with a sour, dissatisfied, scolding
                woman. "Well, when I complied with all her caprices, she was a sugar-plum, or seemed
                so; but when I opposed her slightest whim, she was a green persimmon. By this
                'system she obtained by imperceptible degrees the complete mastery. Every one
                yielded to her, and I among the rest. I could not mount my horse, nor even walk in
                the orchard or garden, without incurring her acid looks, and often a storm of bitter
                invectives. For the sake of peace, I confined myself to my li- brary, and read once
                more the campaigns of the great genius; when, suddenly, my peace was interrupted by
                a discovery that my real estate could not be alienated from the family by my will.
                Then I perceived very plainly the game my spouse had been playing, and comprehended
                the motive of the Jesuit's frequent visits. I happened to be reading, just then, the
                ac- count of the emperor's attempt to commit suicide, after his first abdication;
                and the suggestion of some one that it was not a serious attempt to take his own
                life, but done for some other purpose, caused me to conceive the idea of pretending
                to be dangerously ill. After some little persuasion, the doctor became my
                confederate. I hear him coming, now!" He re- sumed his former attitude, lying on his
                back with his eyes nearly plosed. <pb n="408-409" xml:id="VAC6922-00000210"/> 408 THE WINKLES. "How do you do? How do you
                do?" said the doctor, a upon entering the room, and shaking hands with Walter and
                Lucy. "I am glad to find you with your poor uncle. Ill. ness is a most distressing
                affliction, when one's relatives are not near to nurse him. How do you find yourself
                this morning," continued the doctor, taking the patient's wrist. "They know all,
                doctor. No more nonsense," said the old gentleman, resuming his upright position.
                "We must now begin to look for irsults, for the critical moment is at hand. I await
                only the arrival of my sister Wilsome to strike the decisive blow. Walter is now
                writing her to come to-morrow. Go to the enemy; doctor, and tell them I can't
                possibly survive more than another day. You can convince them of my danger, and
                leave your prescription with them, which they will throw in the fire, or if the
                medicine be pro. cured, I will throw it out of the window. But you shall be paid,
                doctor." The doctor smiled, and then adjusting his features into a their accustomed
                grave expression, sought Griselda, and the Jesuit priest. "Uncle!" said Walter, " it
                seems to me you might have accomplished your object by a more direct means--" "You
                know nothing ---" - "He is a Know Nothing, uncle," said Lucy. ?: What's that? I
                never heard of them before the priest 4 came here. They seem to frighten him very
                much." "Two thirds of the voters in the county belong to our or- der," said Walter.
                "No matter. What I meant to say was that you can never know the influence of a wife
                until you have one. But mine, Inow perceive, is altogether unworthy of me, and I in-
                tend to send her back to her milliner's shop. But there must be a denouement, an
                eclaircissement, and her Jesuitical confederate must be punished. You will like the
                sport, Walter. I set the anticipated diversion in your eye. But be grave, and
                sorrow- ful until to-morrow. And in the mean time make the reeqessary preparations.
                You may consult Blore, if you think he won't be- tray us by his honest looks. And
                Lucy must be prepared to take command of the establishment. Employ a new cook, and
                discharge all Griselda's servants. Write to your mother. She will assist. Send it by
                Dizzle. Now I must lie down and close my eyes, and pick the bed-clothes. I hear them
                coming. THE PHYSICIAN'S OPINION. 409 Recollect I am not to be left alone again. One
                of you must be in the room day and night until the time comes for me to throw off
                the mask and resume the command." The priest came in chanting certain passages from
                the prayer-book, followed by Griselda in tears. Blore's single eye resembled Mars in
                hazy weather. "The doctor says there will be a change at noon 1 to-morrow!" said
                Griselda, in a low voice to Lucy. "I hope it will be for the better, " said Lucy,
                hiding her face. "He fears the worst-and he tells us to prepare for the worst! Lucy
                buried her face in the bed-clothes, and remained si- lent near her uncle. Blore's-
                eye brightened upon observing a significant wink from Walter, and he followed him
                out of the room and down the stairs. "Bawson is not here," said Walter, when they
                were out in the lawn. "No, sir-he can't come tillto-morrow. He's taking the
                deposition of a sick man who swears he married Ralph Ro- land to Bets Dizzle, and
                that he was a preacher at the time, with authority to marry. But that makes no
                difference. Your uncl&amp; has the last will in bed with him under his shirt. But

                march a file of soldiers in with fixed bayonets, and masks on, so she can never know
                them. Then he can sign. And then they won't let him die--I'll answer for that. " "I
                have a still better scheme, sergeant," said Walter. He then imparted to the
                astonished and delighted Blore the stratagem of his uncle, and they set about
                concerting the measures which the circumstances of the case seemed to de- mand. -
                CHAPTER XXXVI. EXPULSION OF THE JESUITS. BEFORE the hour arrived for the change
                foretold by the doc- tor, Miss Wilsome Winkle had reached Babbleton, where she 18

                that had transpired. She readily entered into the scheme for the over- throw of the
                " impudent hussy," as she never ceased to term her brother's wife. Every thing being
                in readiness, Walter conducted his aunt to his uncle's house, and led her into the
                chamber of the pa- tient, where Lucy had been left to watch, and where Griselda and
                the priest were standing on either side of the bed. "Is that you, sister?" asked the
                patient. ' It is, brother-get out of the way, Gusset!"said Wilsome, thrusting
                Griselda aside, much to the chagrin of the latter. "The doctor says I must not let
                him be disturbed," said Griselda. "Sit down by me, Wilsome," said Napoleon. "I feel
                a change approaching. You will stand your ground manfully, won't you, sister?"
                "Never fear! All the men and women and milliners in the world can't frighten me!"
                "His intellects are wandering," said the priest. ' Do you think so?" asked the
                patient quickly, and rising upright in bed. "Mr. Winkle! cried Griselda. "Mrs.
                Winkle!" said the patient, in a manly tone, "I command you to bring hither my will."
                "Your will?" "Yes-my will. I want to read it to my relatives, so that they may know
                what disposition I have determined to make of my property. Be quick-for the change
                is upon me!" "Bring it, daughter," said the priest, "' and likewise per- mit the
                lawyer who wrote it, to enter. Good people," he add- ed, when Griselda went out,
                "the will in question was signed when his mind was clear and steady--" "Good for
                you, father Xavier! I will acknowledge to as much. There shall be no dispute on that
                point. Now," he continued, taking the instrument from the reluctant hands of his
                wife, "I will read the will myself." "He then proceeded to read with a firm voice.
                In the first paragraph, for the repose of his soul, and for the benefit of the pious
                order, of which the priest was a member, there was a devise of one hundred thousand
                dollars, in six per cent. city bonds. The remainder of his personal estate, with the
                NAPOLEON'S WILL. 4" exception of a few trifling legacies, was bequeathed to his
                dearly beloved wife "Gusset, this thing is a contrivance of yours!" said Wil- some,
                taking the instrument out of her brother's hand. "I won't be insulted in my own
                house!" said Griselda, snatching the will away from Wilsome. "Let me have the
                custody of it," said the priest, putting it in his bosom. "You impudent
                bonnet-maker!" said Wilsome. "Your house! The little white two-story frame shop,
                where there used to be a wooden head-yes, a blockhead-is yours!" Be peaceable in the
                chamber of the dying!" said the priest. "He shan't make such a will!" continued
                Wilsome. "It is unjust, and he could not have been in his right mind! He shall make
                another, and I will be a witness to it. Where's the lawyer?" "Here, madam!" said
                Bawson, sliding into the room, having been listening outside of the door. "If you
                advise it, I will do so, sister," said the patient. "You see that the poor man has
                no mind of his own," said the priest; "and any will he may now sign, can be of no
                vir- tue." "That is true, father Xavier," said Griselda, "and your words will be
                repeated in court!" "I will sign this will," said Napoleon, drawing forth the one he
                had kept concealed about his person. Give me pen and ink, Bawson." "He is non compos
                mentis," said the priest. "Daugh- ter, let us not be witnesses of such iniquity!
                Come with me." "Yes, go," said Napoleon, " and remain in the cabinet till I send for
                you. If the doctor comes, despatch him to me," he added, as the priest and Griselda
                closed the door behind them. "You have made a good beginning, uncle," said Walter,
                "Oh, if sister Wilsome will support me, the enemy shall be utterly routed, and I
                will recover my happiness. But be. fore we proceed any farther, let me vindicate
                myself. Some men of military passions delight in slaughter, and they are applauded
                by the world. Some paint battle scenes with the brush, which are admired by
                millions. Poets describe the sanguinary conflict, and mock heroes enact feats of

                madmen. Then why should I be censured or laughed at for enjoying the sport in my own
                inoffensive way? I read of the achievements of that extraordinary man who conquered
                Europe and I amuse myself by re-enacting his exploits in imagination, on my own
                fields. Why am I termed a monomaniac? All men and women are monomaniacs, as I can
                prove by a book in my library. You, my sister, are crazy on the subject of cards---"
                "Cards! The most rational amusement in the world!" "Miss Flora Blount," continued
                Napoleon, "has a mono- maniacal passion for novels. Griselda must be an imperious
                mistress. Xavier must be canonized, like Loyola. Pollen, the poet, must be an
                erratic genius, like Coleridge. And so with thousands, whose views differ from the

                would not be so indelicate as to rise and dress in my pres- ence." "Go, then, with
                Lucy into the next room. I shall cer- tainly rise and dress." As the ladies went out
                the doctor came in. "Ah! Winkle!" said he, "I am a true prophet. The change has
                occurred just as I predicted. But not as the couple I met in the library would wish.
                They hurried me away, and I must immediately report to them. What shall I say??"
                "Wait till I fasten this button. You must say it is all over with me. Stop! Stay a

                Wilsome, glancing at the table and chairs." "Exactly! Choose your partner,
                Wilsome-Lucy or Walter. I'll take the other, and beat you for a bottle. Have you any
                cards?" "Yes-here in my pocket. I'll take Walter." "Very good. All sit down. Now,
                Bawson, go with the doctor to the library. Tell them they may come in and see the
                end. Say, doctor, that your duties are ended-and you may send in your bill
                to-morrow. And tell them I signed the other will before I departed." It was not long
                before the voices of Griselda and Xavier could be heard, but not in lamentation. "We
                can establish the fact," said the priest, "that he was not of sane mind when they
                caused him to sign the last will." "If they will take my testimony," said Griselda,
                "I can prove he had no mind of his own." "But he has recovered his senses," said
                Napoleon, play- ing the last card in his hand, and lifting his large eyes just as
                Griselda and the priest came into the room. "My gracious!" exclaimed Griselda.
                "There has been a gross deception practised on us," said the priest. "No. You have
                deceived yourselves," said Napoleon, sternly. "Why do you stare so? We are merely a
                party of Winkles, all in perfect health, and amusing ourselves, as we have a perfect
                right to do. We are not interlopers here. We are on our own premises. But who are
                you? I will tell you. That woman, by her false pretences, induced me to believe she
                honestly sympathized in the pursuit of my innocent pleasures, when others either
                ridiculed or condemned my idiosyncrasy. I married her, as a reward for what I
                supposed to be her gen- erous defence of me; and bestowed upon her both my name and
                a comfortable home. But she had not been the mistress of my household twenty-four
                hours, before she exhibited her z true colors. Without being restrained by any
                considerations of modesty or propriety, and forgetting her former humble condition,
                she seized the reins as one having the right to rule despotically. This I endured,
                until I became convinced she had neither affection nor respect for me, her
                benefactor; and that she had been made the instrument of an equivocal order of
                religionists, whose interference in the domestic affairs of <pb n="414-415" xml:id="VAC6922-00000213"/> "4 THE WINKLES.

                hearth such an im- pudent and mischievous intruder. Such, madam, is the sen- tence I
                pronounced, and which will be immediately put in execution. "Now, sir," he
                continued, turning to the priest, " when you crossed my threshold, you were well
                aware that I had re- lations to inherit my fortune. I need not ask you if it can be
                truly serving your Maker, to snatch the bread from the widow and the orphan. These
                young relations of mine, as you well know, and knew at the time, are orphans, and
                destitute of for- tune- "Pooh! Brother!" said Wilsome, "don't expose the family. I
                intend to leave them my fortune. Pitch the priest out of the window, and be done
                with it." "You say well, sister; but still I desire to utter my em- phatic
                condemnation of the practice of having sinners encour- aged by the fallacious
                promises of gowned hypocrites, who be- stow their fortunes as an equivalent for
                repentance, or as the purchase-money of redemption, while their families are left to
                starve, and subjected to all the temptations to crime which poverty entails! I thank
                my Maker that I have risen supe- rior to such delusions. "Now, madam," he continued,
                turning again to Griselda, "I do not intend to sue for a divorce; but we shall never
                meet again. If you claim it, and the law allows it, I will pro- vide for your
                maintenance; but you shall dwell no more under my roof. Pack up your clothes. I will
                send your trunks after you. You have the option to go on foot to your shop in the
                village, or to ride in a cart. My coach you shall never enter again." "As for you,
                insidious and sinful priest, It turn you over to the tender mercies of the one you
                sought to despoil of his natural inheritance. Take charge of him, Walter." Walter
                rose up quickly, and passing between the astonished couple, approached the window.
                "Now Close your ears, aunt!" cried he, pulling a cord that came in at the window.
                The next moment the company were startled by a volley of musketry. This wis
                succeeded .by the rub-a-dub-dub of a THE PRISONER. 415 drum, and soon after the
                measured tramp of a file of Blore's men were heard descending the stairway. The
                sergeant himself came in, and going up to the priest, slapped him smartly on the
                shoulder, and ordered him to face about and march. Walter followed them out of the
                room. "Why don't you pack up your things, Gusset? ' demanded Wilsome. "Don't speak,
                but go about it instantly. I will' not lose sight of you until you leave my
                brother's premises, for fear you might set fire to the house. Go-or I will lead you
                by the ear, you impudent strumpet!" Griselda obeyed, livid with rage, and speechless
                with as- tonishment. And a few minutes afterwards she might have been seen alone and
                on foot hurrying along the road towards Babbleton. Lucy sought the cook, to order
                dinner for her uncle ; while the liberated commander promenaded his hall with the
                lofty bearing of a monarch. Walter and the sergeant conducted their prisoner through
                the orchard towards the barracks, while the drum played the rogue's march. Arrived
                at the quarters of the men, a cord and a staff were produced, and the prisoner was
                made to sit down on a blanket. His hands were tied before him, his knees were pulled
                up between his arms, and the staff thrust through in such a manner as to prevent him
                from rising. "FrCangas non lectes!"* said the prisoner, with a smile. "What's that
                he says?" asked Blore. "It's the devil's lingo," said one of the men, who professed
                to have a smattering of all languages. "Extremis malis, extrena remedia," said
                Walter. "There! that's good Dutch," said the wise linguist; "and it's the language
                the devil speaks most fluentially, and under- stands the perfectest. " "But what
                does it mean?" asked Blore. "Am I the devil that I should understand it? Let him use
                the Latin, Greek, Spanish. Italian, French, Irish or Scotch, and you'll see how
                quick I'll turn it into English for you " "It was by such suffering, " said the
                priest, ' that Francis Xavier became a saint!" * You may bend, but, cannot breakane.

                "Your prototype and namesake," said Walter, "was a good man. The founders of your
                order were pure and holy. They made voluntary sacrifices themselves, for the benefit
                of the cause in which they were embarked; and were never known to use fraud in
                coercing others to contribute to their coffers. They were honest men, and went about
                the world healing the wounds of miserable humanity; but their degene- rate
                successors have reversed their principle of action. They care not for the desolation
                and ruin left behind them, in their ambitious endeavors to obtain earthly wealth and
                human power." "That is merely the vulgar opinion-the slander of the Methodists,
                Baptists, Presbyterians, etc." :' No, sir. It is true. You have commanded your
                agents and spies, absolving them from the guilt of perjury, to become members of our
                order of Americans, for the purpose of sow- ing discord amongst us. But you have
                failed. On the con- trary, without incurring the same guilt, we have obtained a
                knowledge of your designs. We have availed ourselves of your example, so far as
                secrecy was concerned, to counteract your iniquitous operations. We shall confront
                you at every turn. Throughout this broad land, wherever there may be a sneaking
                political Jesuit, there will be found a score of patriotic Americans to oppose him.
                Perform your duty, men!" As Walter said this, four of the strongest men seized the
                blanket at its corners, and commenced tossing up the prisoner. Sometimes he fell on
                his back, sometimes on his face; on his feet, and on his head, alternately; but he
                received no bodily injury. When he had been exercised thus for some minutes to the
                infinite diversion of the company, he was put down and unbound. But during this
                operation, a number of printed bonds, Philadelphia 6Xs, fell from his bosom. "Why,
                you impudent thief!" said Walter, looking at the papers, "these bonds belong to my
                uncle. They are payable to him, and he has not indorsed them. You must have stolen
                them." "-No, my son. They were given me by your pious Aunt Griselda, in accordance
                with the provision of the will." "I will take the liberty of returning them to my
                uncle. Now, sir, you shall be released. I will not require any promi- ses or oaths
                from you, since it would appear that your religion has run into such excesses as to
                tolerate and justify every FATHER XAVIER. 417 thing which the Bible teaches is
                dishonorable and sinful. But you may rely upon this: that in every council of the
                Know Nothings your iniquity shall be made known; and that when- ever you attempt to
                execute any of your impious designs, you will be again tossed in a blanket. In our
                order you have at last found a match for your own execrable machinery. You will not
                alone henceforth wield the terrors of an awful mystery. Beware, in time! Do not
                exasperate the millions in this land of liberty, or you will be annihilated at one
                blow. You never can be sufficiently numerous and powerful to prevail against us."
                "Fide etfortitudine,"* said the priest. "Fide, non armis,"t replied Walter. 'What's
                that?" asked Blore. It's all as plain as the face of the bull yonder, staring at us
                across the water, said the learned soldier. "The priest says fight with
                fortitude-and Walter says fight not our armies, and he gives him good advice. It is
                the language of the great Florentine." Both the priest and Walter smiled at the
                erudition 6f the man, whose interpretation was not without signification. Father
                Xavier did not tarry when permitted to depart, and as he strode towards the high
                road leading to the village, the drummer again played the rogue's march. When it was
                ascertained that the last of the invaders had retired from the premises, all the
                forces of the garrison were assembled by Blore in front of the mansion, where they
                uttered cheer after cheer most vociferously. Napoleon appeared on the balcony, and
                manifested by his looks of pleasure the hap- piness he felt. And he gave an order
                for the event of his en- franchisement to be celebrated in an appropriate manner. In
                effect, soon afterward, the whole country, for miles round, was startled by the
                repeated discharges of artillery. At first it was supposed an heir had been born;
                but when it was undi- stood that the doctor's visits had been made to the commander
                himself,.it was taken for granted that the patient was gone. Blore, however, did not
                permit the inhabitants of Babbleton to remain long in ignorance. He dispatched a
                courier to the village with the news of the expulsion of the "Tartarian," as he

                collected in full force in the middle of the street in readiness to hoot at her.
                Pale, and completely subdued, the disgraced wife rushed into her own humble domicil.
                Her tenant, and successor in business, gazed in astonishment. But the tale was soon
                told. It was quickly babbled throughout the village. And, singular as it may appear,
                Gusset had not one to sympathize with her. The poor, of her own condition, had been
                abandoned and frowned upon by her; and the rich, such as the Arums and the Crudles,
                could have no respect for any but the rich, or those in more elevated positions than
                themselves. They sought to level up- wards, not downwards. And hence poor Gusset
                could look for nothing but jeers and contumely from her own sex. Miss Wilsome having
                imparted to her brother the infor- mation that both Lucy and Walter were to be
                married in the spring, and that the countess and the earl would not sail for England
                before midsummer, he immediately proposed that his niece, and Lowe, and the
                countess, should occupy his spacious mansion, as the guests of Walter, which was
                agreed to-Lucy remaining silent, but looking very grateful. In the afternoon the
                splendid' coach was ordered out, and Walter and 'Wilsome were driven in great state
                through the streets of Babbleton to Mrs. Winkle's mansion. Lucy re- mained with her
                uncle, as his housekeeper. But Walter re- joined her in the evening, and
                superintended a grand illumina- tion of the mansion, which was admired by thousands.
                CHAPTER XXXVII. SNOBSON'S MARRIAGE-ROLAND'S FAILURE. WHAT a buzz there was in
                Babbleton! The sudden dis- charges of cannon at the garrison after so long a
                silence, had at first put the country on the qui vive; and afterwards when it was
                known that the beldame parvenu had fallen from her high estate-she who had once
                submitted to the humiliation of repairing old bonnets for housemaids and cooks to
                wear o' Sundays, and had afterwards been made the mistress of one of the finest
                establihments in the country-there could be no THE DOUBLE NUPTIALS. 419 further
                restraint imposed upon the gossiping inclinations of the inhabitants. Woe to the
                wife who is put away by her husband I she falls like Lucifer, never to rise again l
                The Winkles were once more in the ascendant. They were again a united family, rich
                and powerful. The papers had an- nouneed the approaching nuptials of Lucy with the
                Earl of Hilton, and now a paragraph was going the rounds to the effect that Walter
                had been released from jail by the fair daughter of a distinguished senator, who was
                soon to become his wife, and bind him for ever with hymenial fetters. During the few
                months immediately succeeding the recov- ery of Mr. Napoleon Winkle, Miss Wilsome,
                Lucy, and Vir- ginia, spent the greater portion of their time at his stately old
                mansion, which they had renovated and adorned in the most approved style preparatory
                for the festivities of which it was soon to be the scene. It is not to be supposed
                that Lowe and Walter did not sometimes mingle in their consultations. Even the widow
                Winkle herself, who had not been farther from home than the church for many years,
                might have been seen occasionally occupying a seat in the old family coach, as it
                daily rolled backwards and forwards between the chateau and the village. The
                countess too, accompanied by Mrs. Laurel, made several incognito visits to the
                village and the palace without being detected by the reporters. Mr. Napoleon Winkle,
                in consideration of the fact that the countess still lamented the loss of her lord
                on the field of Wa- terloo, suspended his operations in the field, and contented
                himself with the game of chess. In this manner, knights were overthrown, castles
                taken, and kings check-mated,--the countess herself being a match for him, and fond
                of the game. The time fixed upon for the celebration of the double nup- tials was
                the week succeeding the adjournment of Congress. That was the period dictated by
                Colonel Oakland for the ex- change of ratifications. But the Winkles were not to be
                permitted to monopolize the hymenial altar in Babbleton. Negotiations were reopened
                by Blanche Arum with Mr. Thomas Snobson, and a treaty of alliance unconditionally
                aggreed upon, and sanctioned by their parents. The young ones being resolved to
                marry, their pa- rents, under the supposition that their maintenance would cost them
                but little if any more united, than when separated, yielded to their determination.
                    <pb n="420-421" xml:id="VAC6922-00000216"/> 420 THE WINKLES. When it was understood there was certainly to
                be a wed- ding in the Arum family,-and such things are not easily con- cealed,-the
                Crudles were immediately roused to action. Mrs. Crudle undertook to dispose of her
                eldest daughter to Mr. Ro- land; and within forty-eight hours of the conception of
                the resolution, she had so far succeeded, that it only remained for Susan to name
                the day. She consulted Blanche Arum, and it was agreed that their nuptials should
                precede those of the Winkles, and be celebrated the week before the adjournment of
                Congress. When the day arrived, as every appointed day must arrive, however distant,
                Roland and Snobson led their elected brides to the altar in full church. Lowe and
                Lucy, Walter and Vir- ginia, and Parke-who still lingered in the north, while his
                mother was looking for him in the south-and Julia Nitre were among the congregation
                of witnesses. It has never been as- serted in general conversation that Walter was
                more than a mere spectator: but we suppose it to be quite probable he was an
                instigator, if not an actor, of one of the most unexpected and novel scenes that
                ever occurred in the church at Babbleton. Even Lowe and Parke were, very probably,
                privy to the plot. The young ladies, however-Lucy, Virginia, Julia-must be acquitted
                of any complicity. They were merely innocent spec- tators of the ceremony--innocent
                and interested-for each and all of them thought of the approaching day, then near at
                hand, when they too would be called upon to stand at the same altar and make the
                same responses. But why had Bawson been so often in consultation with Walter? It was
                natural to suppose their business had refer- ence to a marriage settlement, and no
                one thought it at all re- markable. And it was to settle a marriage with a
                vengeance! The ceremony proceeded, Mr. Amble officiating, with long candles burning
                behind the altar, although there was an abun- dance of glorious sunshine pouring in
                at the doors and windows. The question of precedence, after a protracted discussion
                of three days, had been settled, and Blanche was to be wedded first. At the
                appointed signal from the priest, Snobson and his elect approached the chancel with
                quivering lips and trembling knees. But, as Mr. Napoleon Winkle remarked, they faced
                the fire very well, considering the desperate affair they were engaged in. They were
                united " for better, for worse, for EXCITING MOMENT. 421 richer, for poorer," and
                then drew back and yielded the place of execution, as Napoleon called it, to the
                other victims. Roland led Susuan forward with consummate impudence. Napoleon said he
                was fool-hardy. The minister proceeded. A stillness prevailed when he came to the
                words-"If any man can show just cause, why they may not lawfully be joined together,
                let him now speak, or else hereafter hold his peace." "If it please your honor,"
                said Bawson, rising in his pew, and addressing the minister as he would a judge, "I
                have something to say why they may not lawfully be joined together." A thrill of
                horror shot through nearly every breast. For many moments all eyes were fixed upon
                the lawyer, and a pro- found silence. ensued, which intimidated Bawson himself.
                "What have you to say, sir?" at last demanded Roland, the minister seeming to be
                incapable of uttering any thing further. "That I am prepared to show just cause why
                you may not be lawfully joined together," said Bawson, still standing "What can you
                show?" demanded Roland. "That you are already married to Elizabeth Dizzle." "Bets
                Dizzle!" repeated many voices. "How can you show that? '" "By this deposition," said
                Bawson, drawing forth the' doc- ument, which he was about to commence reading, when
                Mr. Crudle rushed forward and caught his fainting daughter in his arms, and bore her
                away from the church. Roland mounted his horse and galloped off towards the hut
                occupied by the Dizzles, but it had been abandoned, and Eliza- beth was then in the
                village, sojourning with the lawyer's family. From tongue to tongue the exciting
                news expanded over the village with surprising rapidity. Nor was the astonishing
                announcement of Roland's marriage with Betsy Dizzzle, the only incident which elated
                the good citizens of Babbleton that day. For the father of Tom Snobson, when waiting
                at the depot for the train which was to convey him back to the city, received a
                telegraphic dispatch which caused him to fall down in a fit. His son's father-in-law
                read the communication, while the rest were sprinkling the broker's face with ice
                water. It was the announcement of the failure of one of the largest pri- vate
                banking houses in the country, with which Snobson was intimately connected and
                deeply involved. Nor was that all. <pb n="422-423" xml:id="VAC6922-00000217"/> 422 THE WINKLES. Crudle himself had been
                induced to join them in the gigantic railroad speculation which caused the disaster.
                And now, upon the wedding day, they were both ruined! CHAPTER XXXVIII. END OF THE
                HSTORY. THE bishop came from Summerton to perform the ceremony. Three weddings at a
                time! For after Edmund and Lucy, and Walter and Virginia were irrevocably. linked
                together, Mr. William Dizzle and Miss Patty O'Pan were also joined in wedlock. It
                would be impossible to describe with the pen the felicities of that day. The company
                present came from as many as three cities; and satins and jewels, and happy faces
                surrounded the altar. Even Mrs. Edwards was there, in the gallery, while Sergeant
                Blore looked in from an open window, having had a platform erected for the purpose
                on the outside. And while his single eye beame like a star on the faces of Walter
                and Lucy, Mrs. Edwards' optics were fixed upon him. When the ceremony was over, and
                the party were partaking of the re- freshments prepared at the Widow Winkle's
                mansion, the ser- geant emerged from behind the church in fancied security. But he
                was confronted at the gate by a man over six feet in height. "My mother wishes to
                see you, sir," said the stranger. "She says she has something to say which you will
                be delighted to hear." "Who are you?-and who is your mother?" demanded the old
                warrior. "Mrs. Edwards is my mother, sir; and I am in the service of the Countess of
                Hilton." "Mrs. Edwards! And she was my wife! Sir-who was your father? What is your
                name?" "Dick Edwards, sir." "Dick Edwards! Well, Mr. Edwards, what do you want with
                me? My name is Thomas Blore-and I hope you have not come to claim me as your father!
                I won't acknowledge you, THREE WE3INGS. 423 sirl I deny it, sir I'll-..---knock you
                down, sir!" continued the sergeant, lifting his stick. But Dick being called away,
                to attend his mistress, the fu- rious sergeant was left alone in his fury. The merry
                cavalcade following the coaches, proceeded out on the road leading to Mr. Napoleon
                Winkle's mansion, where preparations had been made for a grand festival. Blore
                followed on foot, growling and gesticulating angrily, for the appearance of Mr. Dick
                Edwards had thrown him into a most violent passion, at the moment when he supposed
                he was about to have a day of perfect happiness. When he arrived at the garrison,
                however he was met by Walter, who appeased him by the comfortable assurance that
                Mrs. Edwards was to sail for England the next week. At the mansion, Mrs. Laurel Mrs.
                Winkle, Miss Wilsome and Miss Flora surveyed with pleasure the vast arrangements
                consummated by Napoleon for the entertainment of the guests. The sumptuous feast and
                the, merry dance filled the first day; and the next morning the brides crowned the
                good old John Dowly with wreaths of flowers. And after that cere- mony was over,
                Miss Tilsome proposed that a row of tables should be placed in the long saloon, and
                that the company be divided into whist parties! Her brother Napoleon offered an
                entertainment on the lawn, where the whole park of artillery had been drawn up and
                charged to the muzzles. But Colonel Oakdale objected. He said the stunning noise
                would be too shocking for the ladies, and that the smoke would spoil their dresses.
                But he suggested that Edmund and Walter should accompany him into the meadows with
                their guns, where there would be excellent sport among the woodcock. Miss Flora
                Blount said such a selfish proposition was most abominable, and that the brides
                would never consent to it. Lucy and Virginia confirmed her opinion; but neither
                could they sanc- tion the scheme she proposed, which was merely a recapitula- tion
                of all the romantic incidents connected with their several courtships. While they
                were discussing the means of adding to their bliss, which would have been a vain
                endeavor, a carriage drove up to the portico, from which descended Mr. and Mrs.
                Parke. en it was understood why Julia Nitre had disappointed her cousin Virginia. "I
                promised to be present at the wedding," said Julia. And you meant your own," said
                Virginia. o" <pb n="424-425" xml:id="VAC6922-00000218"/> 424 THE WINKLES. It was confessed that they had been " engaged
                " for several months, and had deliberately planned the surprise. Several months
                after these happy events, our principal characters, as well as thousands besides,
                were shocked to read the announcement of the death of the poet, Harold Pollen. Of
                all the vicissitudes which had attended his erratic career, the final one was the
                most deplorable. He died after a brief illness, and before his friends could learn
                the particulars of his condition, in the Almshouse! Gusset never sought to annoy her
                husband again, but lived in humble obscurity under the advice of Father Xavier, who
                did not desire a renewal of hostilities with the Winkles. Blore fought his battles
                over again for many a day, under the direction of his old commander, and without
                molestation from the young mistress of the mansion, the lovely Virginia. The widow
                Winkle could not be induced to abandon her abode in the village; but every year she
                spent a portion of her tim6 with Walter at the chateau, in company with Wilsome and
                Flora, and where John Dowly was ever an honored guest. Lucy, the new countess, and
                her sensible lord, came over regularly once a year in an American steamer. And Lowe
                never ceased to enjoy the angling and shooting in his old haunts. Walter had the
                triumph of defeating Plastic in an exciting political campaign; while the colonel
                retained his place in the Senate. Roland was cast in a suit prosecuted by Bawson,
                and ad- judged to pay Elizabeth, his wife, two thousand dollars per annum for her
                maintenance. Bill Dizzle and Patty occupied a-comfortable farm-house on Walter's
                estate-the one catching, the other cooking the frogs and " turtles." Honoria
                disappeared after the publication of Walter's nup- tials. It was surmised that she
                had entered a convent. But Mr. Fimble continued to obtain lucrative contracts from
                the government, until the inauguration of the next President, who was an American.
