               <p>SCHOOL was out: the noisy shouts of the liberated children were becoming fainter and less frequent; hats and caps, which had been taking short excursions in the air, were snugly lodged on the heads of their respective owners; balls had been pocketed, hoops, ball-clubs, and jumping-ropes securely stowed away for another day's recreation; and the scholars were now moving rapidly homeward. Two or three, however, still lingered about the door, watching the movements of four little girls who had not yet left the house, and who were slowly collecting books, slates, pencils, etc., preparatory to a final leave. A pale, studious looking man was standing near the door,-his hat in one hand, and the school-house key in the other,-waiting with a slight degree of impatience for the young misses to make their exit.</p> 
               <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC5768-00000003"/> 
               <p>"Girls, why don't you hurry?" asked a little boy, peeping into the room, and shaking his curly head; "don't you see the master's waiting?"</p> 
               <p>"I don't care if he is!" muttered the eldest of the girls in a low voice, "it's nothing to me."</p> 
               <p>"I'm sure I can't hurry any faster than I can!" said another in a more resolute tone. "But <emph>you</emph> needn't worry yourself, Charlie, we sha'n't trouble him after to-day, I reckon."</p> 
               <p>"O dear! I wish he wouldn't wait," exclaimed a third, "I can't bear to be hurried. Besides, I can't find half of my things. <emph>You</emph> can lock the school-house for once; can't you, Charlie? Oh! Nettie, Nettie! do wait for us: where are you going?"</p> 
               <p>The child thus interrogated had hurriedly, but silently caught up her books, and was now moving rapidly towards the door. She did not appear to hear the words addressed to her, and only paused, when she had reached the side of her teacher. "I am very sorry I have helped to keep you here so long," she said, looking up sorrowfully into his face: "I might have been ready before, but I didn't once think you were waiting for us. I am <emph>very</emph> sorry."</p> 
               <p>"Never mind, my dear," returned the teacher, his face instantly losing its dissatisfied expression, "it is no matter. But is little Nettie sorry for nothing but detaining her teacher a little while?"</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"O, yes sir," replied the little girl, her eyes suddenly filling with tears, "I am very sorry to leave you, for you have always been kind to me, and I like you so much."</p> 
               <p>"And I am very, <emph>very</emph> sorry to lose my little pet. What am I to do without her! Nettie's mother, I suppose," he continued, "has found a better teacher for her little daughter, who will soon forget her old master."</p> 
               <p>"No, no! that is not the reason," exclaimed Nettie quickly; "Miss Belmont is not a better teacher than you are-no one is-but she is a particular friend of mamma's; and, I don't know why, but mother promised me to her before she came to Elville. I think it's too bad! I know I sha'n't like her half so well as I do you. I'll never forget <emph>you,</emph> Mr. Milford, as long as I live. I couldn't do it. You won't forget <emph>me,</emph> will you?"</p> 
               <p>"Forget you, dear? No, I shall not easily forget my little Nettie;" and Mr. Milford placed one hand caressingly upon the upturned brow of the child, while with the other he clasped her little dimpled hands. "But Nettie must love her new teacher," he continued, "and endeavor to make her no unnecessary trouble; and she must not be so thoughtless," he added, with a meaning smile, "as to hide away any of her companions' bonnets, even if they do not chance to be made as prettily as she fancies they should be."</p> 
               <p>"Oh! Mr. Milford, I was <emph>so</emph> young when I did that;-I would not do so now, I am sure;-I am older than I was then."</p> 
               <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC5768-00000004"/> 
               <p>"Yes, you are a <emph>whole</emph> year older, and I really do not think you would wish to do so again. It was apparently a very little thing, my dear," continued Mr. Milford with greater earnestness, "yet it occasioned some of your young schoolmates much unhappiness, until the missing bonnets were discovered; and you were even more unhappy than they, when you found that they imagined you really intended to injure them. I did not mean to lecture you, my child, but as I may never be again your teacher, I wish the only real offence you have ever committed while under my charge, to be made, if possible, the means of preventing future error. I would wish my little scholar whenever she finds herself inclined to annoy, or even play an apparently harmless joke upon any of her companions, to first ask herself how she would be pleased were they to do the same by her. But here are your young friends waiting for you, so I will bid you all good bye." After kindly shaking hands with the little group, the teacher and his scholars separated.</p> 
               <p>"What in the world have you been crying about, Nettie?" asked Ellen Trenton, as soon as the little company were fairly started on their homeward way. "Is it because you are no longer to be <emph>pet</emph> in Mr. Milford's school? <emph>I</emph> never was his favorite, thank fortune; but if I had been I should not make a cry-baby of myself about leaving him. I-"</p> 
               <p>"Nettie is not crying at all, <emph>Miss</emph> Ellen Trenton," interrupted Charlie, sharply, who was now assisting the young<pb n=""/> girls in carrying their books; "but I know who <emph>ought</emph> to cry, though, for speaking before the master as she did."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Mister</emph> Lee, just please to be so good as to mind your own business, will you?" returned Ellen, angrily. "I happen to know what ails <emph>you.</emph> You are vexed to pieces, because we are all going to a more fashionable school than your sister can afford to attend."</p> 
               <p>"Humph! if my father can't afford to send Elva to school anywhere that your father can afford to send <emph>you,</emph> I'm dreadfully mistaken, that's all. Perhaps, <emph>Miss</emph> Trenton, you would like to carry your books yourself, seeing that they are to go to such a genteel place? Perhaps-"</p> 
               <p>"O, Charlie, don't-don't!" whispered Nettie, "never mind what Ellen says. She won't feel so, long."</p> 
               <p>"I'll try to keep still if <emph>you</emph> wish it, Nettie," replied Charlie, "but it does make me <emph>so</emph> mad!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I know, Charlie, but don't let you or me get into any quarrel with them; and Mr. Milford says, 'the least said the soonest mended.'"</p> 
               <p>"Did you hear <emph>that,</emph> Ellen?" asked Susan Champell, "the teacher's pet is mighty good, isn't she? but after all, she's right I s'pose-for if we don't stop soon we <emph>shall</emph> get into a regular quarrel."</p> 
               <p>"I don't mean to say another word until I get home," returned Ellen.</p> 
               <p>"The best thing you've-" said yet, Charlie would have<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC5768-00000005"/> uttered, but a little hand was suddenly placed over his mouth before he could finish the sentence, and a warning whispered in his ear which he manifested no disposition to resist.</p> 
               <p>"I suppose we can learn all kinds of fancy-work at Miss Belmont's school," said Bella Crawford to Nettie a moment after.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I presume so," answered Nettie, "but mother won't let me learn fancy-work now; not until I get farther along with my studies, she says."</p> 
               <p>"Dear me! then you won't be genteel at all;" returned Bella. "Why, that's pretty much all I'm going for. My mother says there's no use at all in a girl's knowing anything about common studies, excepting how to read and write-for when one grows up nobody will think she knows anything if she can't play, and paint, and talk French, and do fashionable fancy-work, no matter how much she knows about everything else. She says it's a waste of time and money to learn what's of no 'count at all, and she won't make her children do it. Your mother must be a queer woman, Nettie; if I was you I'd tease her until she'd be glad to let me learn fancy-work. And they <emph>have</emph> got such pretty worsteds, though, down to the new store! Nettie, I would coax her to let me take worsted work anyway."</p> 
               <p>"It wouldn't do any good, at all," answered Nettie, "for when mother once says a thing, she won't change,-besides, Mr. Milford says my mother and father are my best friends,<pb n=""/> and know better than anybody else what is best for me; and I guess Mr. Milford <emph>knows.</emph> Good bye, all!" and Nettie passed quickly through the little gate which Charlie was holding open for her, and was soon warming her chilled hands by the bright home fire.</p>

               <p>WHAT a beautiful village was Elville! Not that its buildings, either public or private, were in any degree elegant or ornamental,-for utility and economy were evidently the only considerations bearing weight with the majority of its inhabitants,-although a few residences might be found that would be pronounced, both externally and internally, tasteful and genteel. Still Elville was beautiful and picturesque. Its streets were broad and regular; and here and there, large forest trees, held sacred from the settler's axe, stretched their sylvan arms across until they nearly interlocked each other, while they formed a curtain of verdure, which concealed whatever of poverty or uncouth irregularity might have been otherwise too glaringly displayed in the structures which they shaded. A range of hills, steep, and densely wooded from base to summit, rising abruptly from the level of the plain, and sweeping round in graceful curve,<pb n=""/> filled the back ground and bounded the villager's horizon like the walls of a vast amphitheatre. Then Elville had its little lake, or rather pond, the fountain of a bold stream, which, fed from its exhaustless springs, flowed on in unceasing volume, now hugging the hill-side, still and deep; anon, dashing noisily over shelving rocks in a cloud of foam; and again gliding gently down the valley with a pleasant murmur, as it rippled along the pebbly bed which its limpid waters fully revealed.</p> 
               <p>It is but little, however, that we have to do with the scenery of Elville, our business being principally with a few of its inhabitants. We will not, therefore, attempt to give a minute or detailed description; especially as it is not a portraiture from which the original can be traced, that we design giving our readers, but rather a few general ideas of the village in which we have chosen to represent the scenes described in our tale as having occurred. Of course, Elville had its churches, school-houses and hotels; for it numbered some three thousand inhabitants,-and was also fully supplied with the usual variety of mechanics, tradesmen, and professional gentlemen. It also had its "genteel circle," or "first set;" its male and female gossips; and its rival newspapers; and in short, was much like any other northern village of its size.</p> 
               <p>Of the teachers in Elville, Mr. Milford was considered the most competent; and his, though a District School, had<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC5768-00000007"/> been exceedingly popular with both rich and poor. This popularity it certainly well deserved; and he the many encomiums that up to the opening of our first chapter had been unsparingly lavished upon him. Mr. Milford possessed a refined and cultivated intellect, a somewhat poetical imagination, a kind and warm heart, and an unblemished reputation. Affable in his manners, he speedily won the affection, or at least the well wishes of nearly all with whom he became associated. There was also a certain, undefinable expression upon his pale and finely-formed features, that failed not to awaken a sympathizing interest in the beholder. It seemed to speak of past sufferings endured with manly fortitude, and submitted to with Christian resignation; of a sorrow that might have fallen with crushing weight upon one equally sensitive, but possessing less mental strength; and which in his case had not broken, but subdued a naturally lively and somewhat excitable temperament. What this grief was, no one knew; for Mr. Milford had resided only two years in Elville, and although during that period he had formed many friendships, he had, as yet made confidants of none. That his means were limited, would be inferred from the fact, that he had taken upon himself the arduous duties of a teacher, while pursuing the study of medicine; and he seldom, if ever, engaged in any pastime, demanding much of either time or money. For two years he had presided over the District School, mentioned in our first chapter<pb n=""/> ter, and though "birchen rod" or "heavy rule" were rarely brought into requisition, his pupils were generally respectful and obedient, and he possessed their affections in a more than common degree. Parents, also, had apparently been well pleased with his method of teaching; and many of the wealthiest among them, had exchanged congratulations upon their good fortune in having obtained so competent a teacher, with whom to entrust the early education of their children.</p> 
               <p>Latterly, however, the place had received a new impetus. Railroads were in progress of construction, which would soon bring Elville in direct communication with several important towns, now quite remote, and a canal was also in early prospect. Strangers came thronging in, and it was the universal opinion that the little village in the vale must shortly expand into a town of the first magnitude. The "genteel circle," of course, felt themselves called upon at this crisis to do all in their power to promote the credit of the village, by rendering themselves as genteel and consequential as possible; and for this end, the first thing considered necessary, was the establishment of a high-priced Select School. For, how could they expect their children would ever "learn manners," shut up from morning until night in "nothing but a district school, where <emph>everything</emph> went! The idea was absurd, and they were resolved that such a state of things should no longer continue.</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Milford is a very nice young man," said some, "but<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC5768-00000008"/> what can <emph>he</emph> do with such a rabble?" It was plain that he could do nothing, and that something must be done on their part, towards effecting a desirable change immediately. How this was accomplished, we can best explain by introducing our readers into Mrs. Crawford's parlor, a few weeks prior to the opening of our tale.</p>

               <p>IT is nearly evening. Mrs. Crawford had invited company "to spend the afternoon," and now, the last guest expected has entered the room, and located herself in an easy chair, which had been vacated for her by one of the earlier visitors.</p> 
               <p>"It appears to me that you are very formal, Mrs. Trenton," exclaimed Mrs. Lee; "I have been here these two hours."</p> 
               <p>"Dear me! have you?" returned the lady, in a tone of surprise; "I didn't think I was at all late: I meant to be here <emph>quite</emph> early,-as early as half-past five at least; so as to have a little chat with Mrs. Crawford before her other company arrived. I guess it's not much later <emph>now;</emph>" and she examined a new gold repeater as she spoke. "Ah! it is nearly six by my watch, I see. Well-I was detained a few moments on my way here by a little business connected with the project we were speaking of a day or two since.</p> 
               <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC5768-00000009"/> 
               <p>"Mrs. Crawford," continued Mrs. Trenton, turning to that lady, "have you communicated it to the ladies yet?"</p> 
               <p>"No; I thought I would let you do it yourself, as you was the first mover in it."</p> 
               <p>"Really, I am sorry; I was in hopes you had mentioned it; but as you have not, I suppose the task will devolve upon me. We were speaking, ladies, (that is, Mrs. Crawford and myself,) a few days since, about the necessity of having a Select School here, immediately. I, for one, am not willing to send my child to a district school any longer. Ellen does not learn bad habits very easily to be sure, but I can see that even <emph>she</emph> is becoming somewhat ungentle in her conversation and manners, and I attribute it entirely to her present associations at school."</p> 
               <p>An involuntary smile trembled upon the lips of many of the company, as Mrs. Trenton concluded; but it was instantly suppressed, or concealed, by raising a hand or handkerchief to the face, or some other movement equally effectual.</p> 
               <p>"What Mrs. Trenton says, is undoubtedly true," said Mrs. Champell; "I do think we need a different school here; something <emph>altogether</emph> different from anything we have had heretofore. You know we have had our select schools in abundance, and they have never amounted to anything, but have died out of themselves; though the place was much smaller then than now, and the teachers were not to be compared with those we have had in our district school. Could<pb n=""/> we secure really good instructors, I should be quite willing to patronize such a school as is now proposed; for I dislike sending to a public school and will not do it, if anything better can be done."</p> 
               <p>"And then it's so ungenteel!" said Mrs. Crawford; "you won't find anybody that <emph>is</emph> anything, in any other place as large as this, sending their children to district schools, I'll be bound! I have always been opposed to sending girls to the same school with boys anyway; especially such boys as one finds in a district school: it's apt to make them <emph>so</emph> rough and coarse; but in the school <emph>we</emph> talk of having, we mean to have two departments, one for boys and the other for girls. What do you think of our plan, Mrs. Carrol? We must have your opinion."</p> 
               <p>"I hardly know what to say upon the subject," replied Mrs. Carrol, "not having thought much about it of late. I am perfectly satisfied with Mr. Milford's instruction, and should dislike taking Nettie from his school; particularly, as she is much attached to him, and I have not discovered that she has learned any evil there. Still, I must confess that I should prefer sending her to a <emph>good</emph> select school; not, however, on account of its gentility, for I care nothing for that,-but because, the number of pupils being generally much less, the teacher can devote more time to each scholar, and the necessity of sitting during the greater part of the day in a closely crowded room, is in a measure avoided."</p> 
               <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC5768-00000010"/> 
               <p>(Reader, district schools were not then what they are now; for a plurality of teachers, or apartments, were things almost unheard of in that day; one room, and one teacher, being considered all-sufficient for any number of pupils.)</p> 
               <p>"These are my only reasons for preferring a private school," continued Mrs. Carrol; "and though I consider them important ones, I should be unwilling to part with the services of such an instructor as Mr. Milford. Had we a less gentlemanly and competent teacher in our public school, I should say at once let us have a change."</p> 
               <p>"Oh! I hope you will say so <emph>now!</emph>" exclaimed Mrs. Belton, who was a fashionable new comer. "I do hope you will not object to the present plan. I have a daughter and a niece, who ought to be at school somewhere, I suppose; but, I can't think of sending them to a mere district school, where they would be subjected to such contaminating influences; and yet, they are too young to send abroad. Mr. and Mrs. Edgeway have taken their girls out of the common school in their district, more than a month ago, and Mrs. Edgeway has been trying to teach them herself ever since; but she is sick enough of the job I can tell you, and would be glad to assist in supporting a select school. Mrs. Lee, you have said nothing," continued the lady, "you have a little daughter to send, and will, of course, favor our project: will you not?"</p> 
               <p>"I am prepared to do nothing of the kind," answered<pb n=""/> Mrs. Lee, decidedly. "Elva and Charlie would not like to be parted, and I do not choose to separate them. I am well pleased with Mr. Milford and his school, and, for the present at least, shall continue to send to him."</p> 
               <p>"And with the cheap rates, too, I presume," whispered Mrs. Trenton into Mrs. Crawford's ear; "how I do despise such meanness."</p> 
               <p>"Mrs. Carrol, do you know of any suitable person whom we might hope to obtain as a teacher?" asked Mrs. Champell, turning to the lady addressed. "You know you was speaking to me some six or eight months ago, about receiving a letter from a Miss Belmont-I think that was the name-asking if there was a good opening here for a ladies' school. You mentioned her as a highly-accomplished and excellent lady; and seemed to regret very much that there was no favorable opportunity for establishing such a school then. Do you think she could be obtained now?"</p> 
               <p>"That <emph>would</emph> be just the thing!" exclaimed Mrs. Carrol, with sudden animation; "if we can secure Miss Belmont we shall indeed be fortunate. If any of you, ladies, will volunteer to ascertain the number of pupils that can be obtained, I will engage to write to her immediately, and to do all in my power to induce her to come; that is, ladies, if it is your wish that I should."</p> 
               <p>"Certainly! By all means! Do-yes do!" were the responses of the different ladies.</p> 
               <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC5768-00000011"/> 
               <p>"Oh! write without delay!" said Mrs. Champell. "I will warrant her as large a school as she will wish, and also secure for her one of the large rooms over my husband's store; and she shall have it, for one or two terms at least, free of rent."</p> 
               <p>"That's fair enough I should think," said Mrs. Crawford, "and I guess there is little doubt but that she'll have school enough."</p> 
               <p>"How old is this lady, Mrs. Carrol?" asked Mrs. Trenton. "You know it would not do to get <emph>too</emph> young a person."</p> 
               <p>"She is not very young," answered Mrs. Carrol; "her age is, I believe, somewhere between thirty-five and thirty-eight"</p> 
               <p>"Mercy on us!" exclaimed Mrs. Belton, "why, she's an old maid, then-that's dreadful I declare! I'm afraid of old maids; they are so sour and notional, and always so ill-tempered. I am sorry you have decided on this woman, for I am really afraid if she comes, she will make our children as stiff as buckram in their manners, and as notional as herself."</p> 
               <p>"Miss Belmont is not in the least notional," replied Mrs. Carrol; "and as far as disposition and manners are concerned, I really think she would not suffer by a comparison with any of us married ladies."</p> 
               <p>While the above conversation was in progress, Bella<pb n=""/> Crawford had twice passed in and out of the room, on some little errand of her own; and though she tarried but a moment, on either occasion, and did not appear to have given any attention to the conversation going on, she nevertheless received impressions that were to cling to her, and to influence her conduct for many future years. Unfortunately, these visits to the parlor were made at stages of the discussion the least likely to benefit a child; for, as she left the room the first time, it was with the impression that nothing in life was of greater importance than to be thought genteel; and her second appearance was just in season to hear Mrs. Belton's violent tirade against old maids.</p> 
               <p>"I must <emph>never</emph> be an old maid!" said the child to herself, as she passed from the room. "It would be <emph>so</emph> dreadful!"</p> 
               <p>Poor Bella! even before her life reached its meridian, how gladly would she have exchanged places with almost any one of that much-abused and ridiculed class, had it been in her power. How thankfully she pillowed her weary head <emph>then,</emph> upon the sympathizing breast of one of the despised sisterhood, and poured into her pitying ear a tale of crushing sorrow. Poor Bella! but we will not anticipate.</p> 
               <p>In less than three weeks after the visit at Mrs. Crawford's, every necessary arrangement for the new school had been perfected; Miss Belmont had arrived; and was to commence her instructions on the day following the scene described in our opening chapter. It had also been agreed,<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC5768-00000012"/> that no scholar should be admitted for a less sum than five dollars per quarter; that the number of pupils should be limited, for the present, to thirty; and that the attempt to establish a young gentlemen's school in connection with Miss Belmont's, should be deferred until another season.</p>

               <p>OF all the families of distinction in Elville, Mr. Carrol's was, perhaps, the most influential. The wealthiest they were not, certainly; for Mr. and Mrs. Carrol were too charitable to become very rich in this world's goods. Mr. Carrol had been educated for the law, but, soon after his marriage, relinquished the practice, and turned his attention to mercantile pursuits, for which he had a strong predilection. Too honorable to take advantage of others in the way of trade, and too generous to insist upon the payment of his honest dues, where the enforcement threatened to distress or harass the debtor, it is not surprising that his business yielded him only a moderate competency. He was, however, accounted wealthier than he really was, and his charities as well as those of his family, were neither small nor unfrequent. Possessed of a strong and active mind, Mr. Carrol freely mingled in public affairs; and to his coolness and self-control in controversial<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC5768-00000013"/> troversial debate, was to be attributed in a great measure the superior influence that he wielded in Elville. Mrs. Carrol was graceful and lady-like in her manners, and winning in her conversation, but at the same time firm and energetic in her character. From her convictions of right, the opinions of the world could not swerve her; and she never would compromise a principle for the sake of its approval, or through fear of its frowns. Had Mrs. Carrol been like many other wives in her circle, her husband would have found it difficult with <emph>better</emph> management to secure the comforts they now enjoyed; but she had not married with the expectation, so prevalent among fashionable young ladies now-a-days,-of doing nothing but fold her hands in idleness, and be supported by her husband's labor, without permitting herself the trouble to think of household cares. She had been taught by a judicious mother to believe <emph>that</emph> woman most worthy of her own self-respect, and the respect of others, who would seek most to make herself <emph>useful</emph> in any sphere which she might be called upon to occupy. She did not consider it her duty as a wife, to take upon herself all the manifold and laborious details of house-keeping, unless her husband's circumstances should become such as to make it inevitably necessary; but she felt it incumbent upon her to superintend in person all her household arrangements-to see that nothing should be wasted for want of proper care, and to know that everything was appropriated in the most suitable<pb n=""/> manner for her husband's interest, which she held as identical with her own. With such opinions, it is hardly necessary to say that Mrs. Carrol was a prudent and industrious wife. Mr. and Mrs. Carrol were the parents of four children, the eldest of whom was Nettie, already introduced to the reader: and they justly considered that no time was mis-spent that was devoted to their religious, moral, or intellectual improvement.</p> 
               <p>Unlike this couple in almost every respect, were Mr. and Mrs. Crawford. At the commencement of their married life, they had been obliged to adopt a much plainer style of living than the Carrols'; but their circumstances had gradually improved, until now they were counted among the wealthy of the place, and were, apparently at least, behind none in their expenditures, as they certainly could not be outdone in their efforts to be fashionable. Worldly in all their views, they concerned themselves little about their own, or their children's spiritual interests,-conceiving that their whole parental duty would be performed when those children should be provided with a few fashionable accomplishments; should be as showily dressed as any young misses or ladies in the village; and should be finally disposed of by a good matrimonial connection. True, they desired them to receive some moral instruction,-but seldom thought of undertaking the task themselves; <emph>that</emph> was wisely abandoned to their teachers, or to the clergyman under whose<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC5768-00000014"/> preaching they were accustomed to sit. They had indeed gone so far, once or twice, as to forbid their children to make use of profane language-their greatest reason for so doing, it is probable, being, that it was not considered <emph>respectable</emph> to swear. Mr. Crawford himself had once been very profane, and his wife, in by-gone days, had frequently allowed "large words" to escape her lips, even <emph>without</emph> the home circle; but now that they were <emph>fashionable</emph> persons, and such language (in those backward days) was considered unrefined by genteel people,-they had, with much difficulty, so far overcome the habit as "to swear not at all"-except when their patience was more than commonly tried with each other, or with their children-in which case, provided there were none but their own family within hearing, they would occasionally relieve themselves by a round oath or two. Notwithstanding this, Mr. Crawford was rather an easy-tempered man, upon the whole, and was very well liked by all classes. Mrs. Crawford was unrefined, and almost wholly uneducated, and was very far withal from having the best disposition in the world; yet, as she had usually a smooth face for company, was somewhat pretty, rather witty, and, when in good humor, exceedingly sociable, her society was a good deal sought,-although she was far from having as many <emph>real</emph> friends as her husband.</p> 
               <p>The Champells were a family much esteemed for their benevolence, hospitality, and personal amiability; and, perhaps, not a little on account of their wealth-for they were<pb n=""/> in reality the wealthiest family in Elville. Enterprising and public spirited, they exercised great influence over the society in which they moved, without appearing to seek it. Their only apparent fault was the lack of proper government in their own family,-Mr. Champell being too impulsive to govern well, and his wife of too easy a disposition for the requisite home effort and firm perseverance with her children.</p> 
               <p>Ellen Trenton's parents were by no means of the slow and easy sort, for they both possessed sufficiently energetic dispositions, which were frequently displayed in such a manner as to make their owners and all around them feel very uncomfortable. Domestic feuds were of every-day occurrence with them, yet no couple in Elville could be more blandly polite to each other in company than they. To say that they cherished no affection for each other, could not possibly be true; for, was not Mrs. Trenton Mr. Trenton's wife? and was not he her husband? All-sufficient reasons, surely, why affection should exist between them; for it was their principle to hold in lofty estimation all that appertained to their honorable selves. They were not rich-yet everything around them seemed to indicate ample wealth. Mr. Trenton was ever largely in debt, and it was whispered by some, that he was far from being strictly honorable in business matters; others even went so far as to assert that their expensive establishment was kept up almost entirely by borrowed money.<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC5768-00000015"/> But, what of that? The Trentons rode in a better carriage than any other couple in Elville; dressed a little more fashionably; and kept more servants than any of their neighbors. They were also a fine-looking couple,-Mr. Trenton's wig curled beautifully; and his whiskers and coat were both of the most approved cut. When Mrs. Trenton smiled-and she smiled often-she displayed a row of pearly teeth that could not well have been rivalled by Dame Nature's own; and her complexion was of precisely the right shade-not a whit too pale, nor too glowing. Who could say they were <emph>not</emph> a handsome couple? Mr. and Mrs. Trenton considered themselves the cream of Elville aristocracy, in consequence of being distantly related to one or two distinguished families residing in a neighboring city; who, when the cholera or some other dangerous epidemic prevailed in the city, came down to them <emph>on a visit.</emph> In consequence of this elevating distinction, they assumed an air of importance, not very agreeable in itself, but which was tolerated by many, and was <emph>apparently</emph> mistaken by others for genuine coin. In Elville, as in other places, people of great pretensions-how baseless soever those pretensions might be-were sure to find a plenty to cringe to, and to flatter them, while despising them in their hearts.</p> 
               <p>Doctor Lee and his wife were a worthy pair, who, by prudent management, had succeeded in acquiring much larger possessions than was generally suspected by the villagers,<pb n=""/> their style of living being so simple and unostentatious as to lead many to suppose them actually poor. They were pious and amiable persons, and in their own quiet way very benevolent. They were too plain to be called fashionable; still they were considered as belonging to the genteel circle, in virtue perhaps of Doctor Lee's profession, and of Mrs. Lee's being a particular friend of Mrs. Carrol. There were some in Elville who would have gladly cut their acquaintance, had they dared; as Mrs. Lee, though generally quiet, sometimes uttered plain truths in altogether too fearless a manner to be universally popular. Her husband was a successful physician, and it was with him that Mr. Milford made his home, and pursued the study of medicine.</p> 
               <p>Of Mrs. Belton but little was known in Elville, save that she was a widow, well supplied with money, and had in charge two little girls, who stood to her in the several relations of niece and daughter. She was a remarkably fine-looking woman, and in earlier life had evidently been beautiful. Her mind, however, did not appear to be of the highest order-dress and fashionable amusements seeming to be the grand objects of her existence. She had been a twelve-month in Elville, but for what reason she had selected that village for her place of residence, no one knew. She had been accompanied, on her first arrival, by a gentleman, who, from his striking resemblance to herself, was presumed to be her brother; and who had remained only long enough to see her<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC5768-00000016"/> comfortably settled in her new home. This was the total sum of the information that the most inquisitive in Elville had been able to obtain; and, for the present, we will not seek to be wiser than they.</p>

               <p>FIVE years have passed away since our last peep in Elville, dear reader, and not a few are the changes that have taken place during their noiseless flight. Elville is no longer a little village, although its growth has not been so rapid or extensive as many had predicted it would be in a shorter space of time. The long-talked-of canal had never been commenced, but the "iron horse" came pufflng and blowing into the very heart of the village, and with it all the noise and activity of city life. Population had been attracted hither, and was increasing still; business was flourishing; and many of the old inhabitants had removed into new and<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC5768-00000017"/> expensively-finished houses, and rented their former habitations to new comers. An academy had been erected in the midst of a charming little grove, and the ladies' department was superintended by Miss Belmont, who had succeeded in winning the confidence of both parents and pupils. A gentlemen's department had also been organized, and the supervision tendered to Mr. Milford; but, as he had nearly completed his course of study with Doctor Lee, and was at that time preparing to leave town for the purpose of availing himself of a course of medical lectures in a neighboring city, the offer was of necessity declined. A gentleman by the name of Castlebury having been finally procured, and installed, this department was put in operation, and had now been in existence about three years. Under Mr. Castlebury's and Miss Belmont's management, the school flourished as well as could be desired; and was held in high reputation, not only at home, but its fame had spread abroad; and many were the residents of other towns who had placed their sons and daughters in Elville, for the advantages of attendance upon its academical school. Other changes had taken place in the village, but as they do not immediately concern our readers, we pass them by, to enquire after some of our early acquaintances.</p> 
               <p>It is a pleasant afternoon in June; the sky is clear, and straggling rays of bright sunshine penetrate the grove surrounding the academy, and illuminate the green carpet which<pb n=""/> the dense foliage overhead otherwise shaded. It is the time of recess for Miss Belmont's school; and walking about the grove, or standing in couples, or groups under the trees, are the young misses of the Institution, some of them, perhaps, old enough to entitle them to the designation of young ladies. Apart from the rest, a group of the larger girls are conversing, apparently in some little excitement. These are our early friends.</p> 
               <p>Ellen Trenton, the eldest of the little company, is a tall and graceful looking girl just past her sixteenth birthday. To those who see nothing beyond physical regularity of form or feature, she might appear handsome; but to the eye of the physiognomist accustomed to trace upon the lineaments of the face the interpretations of the heart,-she is destitute of nearly all that renders the human countenance lovely or pleasing.</p> 
               <p>Near Ellen stands Susan Champell. She is a few months younger than Miss Trenton; has not so fine a form, but is more interesting in appearance and manners.</p> 
               <p>Next in age, though not in stature, is Nettie Carrol. She is the smallest of the group, and though somewhat <foreign xml:lang="FRA">petite</foreign> for a girl turned of fourteen, her figure is exceedingly symmetrical. She is not beautiful, but her delicately moulded face beams with a sunny, happy look, more captivating than the most faultless beauty. The lily predominates in her complexion, save when sudden excitement or emotion brings<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC5768-00000018"/>

                        <l>To mantle her cheek with roses."</l> 
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>Close at Nettie's side, with one hand resting upon her arm, and in the other holding a small slip of paper, stands Bella Crawford. She is not yet fourteen, but is larger and somewhat taller than Nettie. At the first glance, Bella would be pronounced beautiful. Glossy hair, bright eyes, blooming cheeks, and a clear transparent complexion are hers; of all which charms she is evidently fully conscious. Unfortunately this consciousness is too visibly enstamped upon her every movement, asking in language plain, though mute-"See! am I not beautiful?"-and sadly impairing her loveliness in the eyes of others.</p> 
               <p>Bella was ever a little romantic,-and latterly, she had acquired a taste for novel reading, which amounted to a passion. Romances of the most fanciful and extravagant character, pleased her best; and "<title>Alonzo and Melissa,</title>" "<title>The Three Spaniards,</title>" and "<title>The Bandit's Bride,</title>" became her especial favorites. The influence of such selections upon her mind, were soon apparent in her conduct and manners. Striving usually to imitate the heroine of her last novel, her otherwise pretty face would be sometimes ludicrously disfigured by her attempts to assume an afflicted, tender or melancholy expression; or perhaps an extremely sprightly and intelligent look-whichever would most nearly correspond to the latest model selected for her imitation.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>The reader must not imagine any interval to have elapsed with the little company, while we have been giving this cursory, yet somewhat lengthy description of the individuals composing it; but recur back to the moment of their first introduction to our notice.</p> 
               <p>Bella Crawford had just joined the remainder of the group, and was now standing with one hand resting on Nettie's arm, as we have said.</p> 
               <p>"Oh! girls," she exclaimed, "see what I have found; here is a note, written in a gentleman's hand about Blanche Rathbone. Funny isn't it? I found it under one of the windows belonging to the gentlemen's department, as I was coming along. It's in poetry too, if I can read it right; but not very sentimental nor complimentary either. Nettie, what do you think your bosom friend Blanche will say, when she sees this?"</p> 
               <p>"For pity sake, what <emph>can</emph> it be?" exclaimed Nettie quickly, "do let me see it!" and she put out her hand for the paper; but Bella, as if fearing that she would snatch it, raised herself on tip-toe, and held the paper at arm's length, above her head.</p> 
               <p>"I wasn't going to snatch it," said Nettie, "but do let me read it-won't you?"</p> 
               <p>"I rather think I shall not, Miss Carrol."</p> 
               <p>"Then read it yourself, Bella," said Ellen Trenton.</p> 
               <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC5768-00000019"/> 
               <p>"My name is not Bella;-it is <emph>Arabella,</emph> Miss Trenton, if you please."</p> 
               <p>"Oh! <emph>Arabella,</emph> then-excuse me;" and Ellen's lip curled scornfully; "do read it yourself, or let <emph>us</emph> have it," she continued, raising her hand for the paper.</p> 
               <p>"No! <emph>you</emph> sha'n't have it, either," said Bella; "but I will read it: now, all listen, for it is sublime! Hark!</p>

               <p>"How scandalous!" exclaimed Nettie, indignantly, as Bella finished, "who could have been so malicious as to write that?"</p> 
               <p>"Some one in the gentlemen's department, of course," answered Susan Champell, "and not one of the younger lads either; for the writing is too good to be the work of an unpracticed hand."</p> 
               <p>"So it is," returned Nettie, examining the penmanship, which Bella now permitted; "but no true gentleman could have condescended to write it. Poor Blanche! how it will make her feel. She is so sensitive too; suppose we do not let her know it at all. I'm <emph>sure</emph> she has done nothing to deserve it."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> don't know <emph>that!</emph>" returned Bella; "at any rate I shall show it to her, for the note is hers; it was written '<emph>For</emph> Miss Blanche Rathbone, the <emph>great</emph> poetess,' and she shall have it. It may do the little vain thing some good. She is so proud of her borrowed compositions, and thinks herself so superior, that I, for one, am glad to have something come across her; if only to let her see that she isn't so generally admired as she thinks herself. I'm glad of it."</p> 
               <p>"Oh! Bella, how can you talk so?" said Nettie earnestly. "I am Blanche's most intimate friend; and <emph>I know</emph> that she is neither proud, nor vain, in the way you say,-and <emph>I</emph> don't believe that she ever borrowed a composition in her life."</p> 
               <p>"Well, <emph>I</emph> do!" exclaimed Ellen. "I know that no young thing like her, ever composed such verses as she read last composition day; besides, Mary Wilkins read them long ago in a book-she told me so, herself."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I know she <emph>said</emph> so," returned Nettie, "and Blanche tried to get her, either to show her the poetry, or tell her what book it was in;-but Mary couldn't do either. Blanche laughed a good deal about you girls saying that <emph>that</emph> piece had been borrowed from print; for she said <emph>she</emph> had discovered so many faults in it, that she thought it hardly fit to read for a composition, without a revision; but that not having time to correct it, she was obliged to read it, imperfect as it was, or none at all."</p> 
               <p>"Well, that's neither here nor there," replied Ellen,<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC5768-00000020"/> tartly; "but one thing is pretty certain-such a note as <emph>that</emph> would never have been written about <emph>her,</emph> or any one else, if there was no occasion given. I always did think Blanche a forward, pert little thing, who would some time be the laughing-stock of the whole town; and I believe that time will soon come, too."</p> 
               <p>"You mean, you <emph>hope</emph> it will," suggested Nettie.</p> 
               <p>"Well then, I <emph>hope</emph> so, and <emph>think</emph> so too, Miss Nettie, if that will suit you any better. But it seems to me, that if I were you," she continued, "I would not care to make myself known as Blanche Rathbone's particular friend, just at this <emph>particular</emph> time;" and Ellen threw a meaning glance to Bella as she finished speaking.</p> 
               <p>"I know of no <emph>particular</emph> reason why I should not," retorted Nettie warmly; "I should scorn myself, if I could forsake a friend, simply because some ill-bred person, too cowardly to give his own name, had addressed to her an insulting note. I do not think it will injure Blanche in the least; but if it should, I am no summer friend, to flee when storms approach."</p> 
               <p>"I should like to engage you to befriend <emph>me,</emph> Nettie," said Susan, laughingly. "I should <emph>really</emph> like to have some one like you to defend me, when I chance to be guilty of any misdemeanor, or by some accident get myself into hot water; it would be so comfortable. Can't I engage you, think?"</p> 
               <p>Nettie was not pleased with these words, nor the manner<pb n=""/> in which they were spoken; and as the school-bell, which had for the last minute been sounding in their ears, suddenly ceased ringing, she made no reply to Susan; but, exclaiming, "come girls, the bell has stopped-we must hurry," she hastened towards the Academy, whither she was followed by her companions.</p>

               <p>THE pupils of Miss Belmont's school having returned once more to their tasks, we pause in the narrative to give our readers some insight into the history and character of the young girl who was the subject of conversation, as we have related in the preceding chapter.</p> 
               <p>Blanche Rathbone was the niece of Mrs. Belton, of whom former mention has been made. When a mere infant, her father had been carried to his grave; and in less than a year thereafter, was followed by his wife, who, upon her death-bed, committed her only child to the care of her half-sister, Mrs. Belton. This was all that was positively known in Elville of the previous history of the little orphan; but it was rumored that Blanche did not always find her present home a<pb n=""/> happy one,-and in this instance, we must admit that Madame Rumor did not exceed the truth. Perhaps she might have found her situation more agreeable, had it not been for the jealous and selfish disposition of her cousin Kate, who was a few months her junior, and who had been so much indulged by her mother, as to have become, in almost every sense, a spoiled child. It was evident to all, that Mrs. Belton considered that a broad line of separation existed between her daughter and her niece; and this the latter was made to feel quite frequently. That there was in reality a wide difference between them, was generally acknowledged; but the orphan was never a sufferer by the comparison-any other person than Kate's mother being the judge.</p> 
               <p>Blanche was now nearly fifteen years of age, and had grown into a faultless figure; while she possessed other graces of person and manner unusual in one so young. Her countenance was intellectual and striking; but in disposition she was somewhat singular. Trifles that others would pass unheeded, would frequently annoy and seriously provoke her, when heavier trials were borne with a degree of patience and fortitude that would have done honor to the brightest examples of Christian resignation. She was proud spirited and sensitive; and when that pride was designedly wounded or insulted, her feelings were impetuous and violent for the moment; but a kinder, more trusting, or a more generous and affectionate heart, never had its home in a human breast.<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC5768-00000022"/> Blanche was <emph>too</emph> sensitive to be truly happy, as she was now circumstanced; and, perhaps, too impulsive and independent to be thought amiable; and yet, though any indignity offered her was felt keenly, and usually at once resented, she never harbored thoughts of retaliation or revenge. Though she did not always <emph>forget</emph> an injury, the offender was generally <emph>forgiven,</emph> and often became the recipient of some of her acts of greatest kindness. Poetry was her passion, and she had been accustomed to indulge in its composition, for which she had a decided natural talent, from her early childhood. She was extremely fond of reading,-and poetry, history, romance, each received a share of her attention; while latterly, scientific and theological books were becoming interesting and attractive to her mind.</p> 
               <p>That the selections of Blanche might have been injudicious in so wide a range of reading, if left to her own guidance, is more than probable; but, fortunately for her, soon after her arrival in Elville she had become acquainted with Nettie Carrol, and had formed for her a strong attachment, which was warmly returned; and the two little girls felt themselves bound together by no common tie. Mrs. Carrol had at first looked upon this growing intimacy with uneasiness,-for she was well aware of the influences that surrounded Blanche at her aunt's dwelling, and was fearful lest Nettie, in consequence of so intimate an association, should imbibe ideas or habits that might greatly interfere with her future happiness<pb n=""/> or usefulness; and which it might be difficult to eradicate. She soon, however, discerned the true character of the child; and seeing that little was to be feared from her as yet, and that she was easily influenced by those she loved, she determined if possible to win her confidence, and to do her all the good in her power, both for Blanche's own sake and the sake of Nettie her daughter.</p> 
               <p>It was no difficult matter for Mrs. Carrol to obtain the affection and gratitude of the warm-hearted little orphan girl; and in a short time she exerted over her an almost boundless influence. It was Mrs. Carrol who selected her reading, and governed her choice of books; and by her advice, Blanche perused no work without first submitting it to her inspection and receiving her favorable opinion; for with her, a request from Mrs. Carrol had the weight and sanctity of a law. It was probably owing to the watchful friendship of this lady, and the ever-present influence of herself and family, that so striking a difference existed between Blanche and her cousin.</p> 
               <p>Kate Belton was far from being an ill-looking girl, although she was not what is termed a regular beauty. An ornament to society she might have been had she been blessed with a more judicious mother, and been educated under better auspices; for, naturally, Kate was not more evil-minded than the majority of her companions,-as it was, however, her destiny only verified once more the truth of the old, trite adage, "As the twig is bent, the tree is inclined."<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC5768-00000023"/> Her temper was now very bad; but she had never been taught to control it. She was jealous; but she had been so pampered and petted during her whole life, as to induce the belief that no one was justly entitled to as much attention as herself. She was indolent, and consequently disinclined to much exertion of either mind or body; but then she had not only been indulged in sloth, but even taught to consider much <emph>physical</emph> exertion as entirely beneath a lady; and who needs to be told, at this day, that when the bodily powers are suffered to languish for want of suitable exercise, our mental faculties can retain only a sickly and feeble activity. One thing, notwithstanding, Kate considered of vast importance, which was to be accounted fashionable and genteel; and for this she was even willing to exert herself if necessary. After what has been related of the mother, no one will be surprised at the existence of such fancies in the daughter. In society, Kate endeavored to be polite and agreeable, and generally wore a very smooth exterior; consequently there were many who were not aware of her real disposition and character.</p> 
               <p>After all, Kate was not wholly bad; for she was generous when to be so did not call for self-denial; and when nothing had occurred to arouse her evil propensities, she was kind and sometimes even affectionate. She manifested also strong attachment for birds and plants, and all domestic animals; and we hold that the heart in which such sensibilities can<pb n=""/> be awakened, must contain, at least, some germs of goodness.</p> 
               <p>Kate and her cousin had been pupils at Miss Belmont's school from its commencement, but neither of them had been very regular in their attendance. Whenever a particularly hard lesson was on hand, Kate made it a rule to absent herself; and Blanche was frequently detained at home by ill health, but more frequently to assist in the kitchen when the servant was sick or absent, or anything requiring extra help was going on. Both of the girls had their friends among the pupils, but, strange as it may appear, Kate could number far more than her cousin. Blanche, however, was a great favorite with Miss Belmont and her assistants; and this circumstance, added to the fact that she had written several poetical compositions that were received with much favor by her teachers, constituted the only apparent reasons for her want of popularity with the majority of her schoolmates.</p> 
               <p>When the academic school was first opened, its teachers had strictly interdicted all communication between the male and female departments of the academy upon the grounds belonging to the institution; but finding such prohibitions useless to prevent occasional meetings of the pupils in going to and from the school, they were wisely abandoned. On after-thought, it was concluded that it would be well for the schools to be allowed to pay each other a mutual visit; and that such an arrangement might be made very useful as the<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC5768-00000024"/> means of exciting laudable emulation among the scholars, and awakening in them a greater desire to excel in their studies. Accordingly, the young ladies and their teachers were invited into the gentlemen's department once a month to listen to the oratory and recitations of the young gentlemen; and the latter were as often permitted to visit the ladies' department to hear the reading of compositions and other exercises; and as no discoverable evil had as yet grown out of these interchanges, but rather the effects desired, they were still continued to be permitted.</p>

               <p>"MISS Belmont, can I speak to Miss Rathbone?" asked Bella Crawford, soon after the young ladies had resumed their seats in the school-room.</p> 
               <p>"Why did you not speak with her during recess, Miss Crawford?" returned her teacher.</p> 
               <p>"Miss Rathbone did not leave her desk," said Bella; "and, besides, it was not necessary <emph>then.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Is it really so now?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, ma'am-very: can I speak just <emph>one</emph> moment?"</p> 
               <p>Miss Belmont was naturally indulgent, and she assented.</p> 
               <p>"Oh! Blanche!" whispered Bella, crossing over to that young lady's desk and bending over to her ear, "see what I've found under one of the windows while we were out. A note for you, and written by one of the young gentlemen<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC5768-00000025"/> too! Well, there! I almost made a rhyme, didn't I? Now if you won't be too proud, Blanche, I'll give it to you," and she slipped the paper into Miss Rathbone's hand as she spoke.</p> 
               <p>"What can this mean?" asked Blanche, with a surprised and perplexed look, after glancing hastily over the contents of the note, "what <emph>can</emph> this mean, Bella?"</p> 
               <p>"O, that's for <emph>you</emph> to say, my dear, I know nothing about it, of course."</p> 
               <p>"Me!" exclaimed Blanche, with such a grieved look that Bella was touched, and she hastily replied:</p> 
               <p>"O, I didn't suppose that you knew anything about it; it can't mean much of anything; I wouldn't let it worry me, if I were in your place. Some ill-mannered fellow has doubtless taken some dislike and-"</p> 
               <p>"Miss Crawford will now resume her seat," said Miss Belmont, in a tone of command; and Bella, without attempting to finish her sentence, obeyed.</p> 
               <p>Poor Blanche bent her eyes over her books, and endeavored to concentrate her mind upon her study, but in vain; her thoughts were upon the heartless note-and she was unable to accomplish a respectable recitation during the remainder of the afternoon. And when at last school-hours were over, she hurried home, with a heart full of mortification, perplexity and distress.</p> 
               <p>Kate had remained at home that afternoon, nominally to<pb n=""/> nurse a headache,-but in reality to avoid a somewhat difficult lesson,-and consequently knew nothing of the trouble that was weighing so heavily upon the mind of her cousin. Blanche felt that she could hope for little sympathy from Kate, and therefore determined to make no mention to her of the circumstance that had occurred, until she had seen, and advised with, Mrs. Carrol and Nettie upon the subject.</p> 
               <p>As soon as she could leave home, Blanche set out for Mr. Carrol's, but had gone only a few steps when she was overtaken by Charlie Lee, who was walking in the same direction. It instantly occurred to Blanche that he might be able to throw some light upon this singular affair, as he was one of the students, and she resolved to question him.</p> 
               <p>After the usual salutations, and as she was revolving in her mind the best method of introducing the painful subject, young Lee led directly to it, by the question-</p> 
               <p>"You are looking very pale and sad this evening, Blanche, are you sick? or has anything occurred to distress you?"</p> 
               <p>"I am not sick, Charlie," returned Blanche, "unless it is sickness to carry such a heavy heart as mine. I would like to ask you a question, or so," she continued; "if I do so, will you answer me truly?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly, if I answer you at all," replied the young man, somewhat proudly; "did you ever know Charlie Lee to utter an untruth?"</p> 
               <p>"No, never! and I did not think he would now-but I<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC5768-00000026"/> feared that perhaps to spare my feelings, he might not be quite candid with me. I wish to ask you," she continued, producing the note and handing it to her companion, "whether you know by whom this was written; and if you have ever seen or heard of anything in my conduct calculated to provoke or justify such insulting language?"</p> 
               <p>"The writing certainly <emph>looks</emph> familiar," replied Charlie, examining the chirography attentively, "but I cannot say whose work it is, for I do not know-and"-he paused.</p> 
               <p>"You do not answer my question," urged Blanche.</p> 
               <p>The youth looked confused, blushed slightly, and made one or two rather awkward attempts at clearing his voice. "I think," he at length said, "that nothing whatever could justify any <emph>gentleman</emph> in penning such a note, for the eye of a lady."</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Lee," exclaimed Blanche, almost indignantly, "you talk strangely! Your words and manner imply that you believe there <emph>has</emph> been something on my part to give color-some circumstance of my conduct to occasion such coarseness as this note contains. Oh! what can it be, Charlie?" she continued in a more subdued tone, "tell me frankly, I implore you, tell me all."</p> 
               <p>"I will tell you Blanche all that I can, and more maybe than I ought. I can say truly, that <emph>I</emph> have never, during our long acquaintance, seen aught in you to provoke an ill-natured remark; but, Blanche, as a friend-and you know I would not willingly or unnecessarily wound your feelings, for<pb n=""/> the world-as a <emph>faithful</emph> friend I fear, that if what is reported of you be true, I must say that you have acted very unwisely; and the affection and confidence which you have lavished upon almost a stranger, has been sadly misplaced, and unfeelingly betrayed, and-"</p> 
               <p>"In pity, Charlie, stop!" interrupted Blanche, with a look of utter amazement; "do not tell me anything more until you have explained what you have already uttered. I cannot comprehend your meaning; indeed I cannot-but this I <emph>know:</emph> I am not guilty of the imprudences that you say are imputed to me, and this is the first time I have heard of my being charged with anything of the kind. I cannot imagine to what stranger you refer, for I have bestowed upon none either affection or confidence. No, no!" she continued vehemently, "this is a base conspiracy!"</p> 
               <p>"Then you have never addressed billets of affection to young Selden!" exclaimed, rather than questioned Charlie.</p> 
               <p>"Never! <emph>never!</emph>" and Blanche's eyes opened wider and wider.</p> 
               <p>"And were you not aware of his having received such epistles, purporting to have come from you?"</p> 
               <p>"Indeed-no! can it be that such is the case? Oh! Charlie, it cannot be! Say you were only jesting with me-a bitter jest-your words were meaningless: <emph>you</emph> surely cannot think me guilty of such gross and glaring improprieties?"</p> 
               <p>"No-Blanche; I now see plainly that you are perfectly<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC5768-00000027"/> innocent; forgive me for having for one moment thought you could be otherwise. You are the victim of a foul plot, which, doubtless, owes its origin to the malice of some of your school-mates; for this was no ill-timed and cruel jest which I have perpetrated, to play upon your wounded feelings. If you think you can bear it, Blanche, I will now relate to you all that I know of this matter."</p> 
               <p>"I can bear anything better than suspense. I am anxious to know the worst: tell me at once, Charlie, and tell me all."</p> 
               <p>"It is not quite a week since," began the youth, "I first observed an unusual excitement among several of the elder students over what appeared to be a letter, and which seemed to be the occasion of a wonderful degree of mirth with them; but as they said nothing to me, and seemed to be a little private about the matter, I of course asked no questions. It was not until yesterday morning that I was informed of the secret. I was then told that young Selden had received several letters from you, expressive of the most intense admiration and affection; and that though he had never replied to them, they continued to reach him laden with the strongest and most fervent expressions of regard. When this tale reached my ear it had already become the subject of common conversation among the students. I at first took it upon myself to deny the possibility of the thing; but several of the letters were then shown me which were signed 'Blanche Rathbone,' and written in a lady's hand. I could<pb n=""/> not say positively that it was <emph>not</emph> your writing-not being familiar with your penmanship-but I still insisted <emph>to them</emph> that it must be a forgery; that such letters could not have originated with you; that in the first place you were not acquainted with Selden; and secondly, if you had been, and admired him ever so much, that you never would have so far forgotten the delicacy of your sex as to have written billets couched in the language those letters contained.</p> 
               <p>"In reply to all this, I was told that you had had a speaking acquaintance with Selden for several weeks; that you had frequently spoken of him in terms of warm admiration; and that from the manner in which the letters had been forwarded to him, they could not avoid the conclusion that they had been sent by yourself."</p> 
               <p>"I stop here," said Blanche, grasping Mr. Carrol's gate which they had just reached, and clinging to it as if for support; "I stop here."</p> 
               <p>Her voice sounded so strangely that Charlie Lee was alarmed. He had purposely avoided meeting her glance while relating what he felt must be keenly embarrassing for her to hear-but one glance at her face now startled him. Though the shades of twilight were deepening around them, he could see that it was fearfully pale, and indicative of intense mental suffering.</p> 
               <p>"I have said <emph>too</emph> much!" he exclaimed passionately; "fool that I was not to have known that you could not bear it,<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC5768-00000028"/> Poor Blanche! I have nearly killed you! and yet, heaven be my witness, I only thought to do you a kindness."</p> 
               <p>"Do not reproach yourself, Charlie," said Blanche; "you have only done what was your duty as a true friend; and you have done it so kindly and so feelingly that while my poor heart beats I shall not cease to remember it with gratitude. I must have heard it eventually, and it is better that I should have done so now from the lips of a friend, than hereafter when its work of malice should be further accomplished. But it is very, <emph>very</emph> unexpected, and has shocked me dreadfully. I will be calmer soon. Mrs. Carrol will tell me how to act in this matter."</p> 
               <p>"But, Charlie," she continued, "before we part, I must tell you what foundation there has been for the report that I have become acquainted with Mr. Selden and spoken in his praise-and yet, we must not stand here;" she added, suddenly. "Can't you come in for a moment?"</p> 
               <p>"I will go with you to the door," replied Charlie, opening the gate, "and if we <emph>do</emph> stand <emph>there</emph> a moment before ringing it will be no matter."</p> 
               <p>"One afternoon, about two weeks ago," resumed Blanche, as they passed into the yard, "my aunt requested me to call in at Mrs. McMillen's on my way to school, and do an errand for her. As it was after the usual hour for commencing school, and all Mrs. McMillen's boarders were students, I did not of course anticipate meeting with any of them at her<pb n=""/> house; but just as I was about leaving, young Selden came into the room for a book he had forgotten, whereupon he was immediately introduced to me by Mrs. McMillen; and we left the house together. We exchanged a few common-place remarks while passing to the street, and when we reached the gate he held it open for me to pass through, as any gentleman would have done. To avoid walking in his company to the academy-which I feared might be seized upon as a pretext for unpleasant remark-I resolved not to proceed directly there. So I bade him good day at the gate, and crossed the road as if to return home. Since that time I have accidentally met him three or four times, merely exchanging bows; and this is the extent of my acquaintance with Mr. Selden. Previous to my introduction at Mrs. McMillen's, however, Ellen Trenton, Bella Crawford, and one or two other girls, had questioned me so much about him as to excite in me some surprise and vexation. At first they desired my opinion of his personal appearance, and I replied promptly-you know that I am naturally frank and plain-spoken-that I thought him remarkably fine looking. They then wished to know what I thought of his oratorical powers; to which I answered that I considered them most extraordinary for a person of his age. Again asked if I had formed his acquaintance, I replied 'No.' This some of the girls affected to disbelieve, and charged me with not only being acquainted with, but also quite partial to him. This I solemnly denied, and<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC5768-00000029"/> protested that though I thought him fine looking and talented, I had <emph>not</emph> made his acquaintance, and had not the least desire to do so, as I had heard him spoken of as vain and egotistical; and this is the purport of all that I have ever said of him. I cannot imagine who could have had the malice to write those letters;-but you have not told me <emph>how</emph> they were conveyed to Mr. Selden; will you not tell me, Charlie?"</p> 
               <p>"Not now, Blanche, for I hear some one coming to answer the bell; besides, you have heard quite enough for the present-I will see you again soon. Good night!"</p> 
               <p>"Good night," repeated Blanche; "you believe what I have told you, don't you, Charlie?"</p> 
               <p>"Believe you, Blanche; most truly, every word."</p>

               <p>THE lamp was already lighted as Blanche entered Mrs. Carrol's sitting-room, and a fire was burning cheerfully upon the hearth. Mrs. Carrol and Nettie were sitting by the fire <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tte--tte.</foreign> The subject of their conversation had evidently been anything but pleasurable; for the usually serene countenance of the one, and the sunny face of the other, were looking strangely sad and troubled.</p> 
               <p>"Good evening, my dear," said Mrs. Carrol, with her wonted kindness of manner when she perceived Blanche; and Nettie sprang to meet her with more than ordinary tenderness.</p> 
               <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC5768-00000030"/> 
               <p>"I am glad you have come!" she exclaimed. "I thought you would be here this evening-but it was getting so late that I had nearly given you up. I have just been telling mother about that foolish note that was found to-day, and she says-but mercy, Blanche! how dreadfully you are looking. Do sit down-what <emph>is</emph> the matter?"</p> 
               <p>"It is one of my misfortunes to betray in my face what is going on in my heart," said Blanche, bursting into tears, and sinking upon the sofa. "Oh! Nettie, how dreadful it is to be the object of so much enmity. What have I ever done to provoke so much malice."</p> 
               <p>"My dear child," said Mrs. Carrol, "you must endeavor to control your feelings; do not suffer so trifling a thing to make you so unhappy. The opinion of any person who could degrade himself so low as the penning of such a note, is not worthy of the least regard."</p> 
               <p>"Oh! Mrs. Carrol-you do not know <emph>all,</emph> or you would not blame me," answered Blanche, endeavoring to speak calmly; "you or Nettie cannot imagine of what an indelicacy I have been accused. The note is nothing-<emph>nothing,</emph> in comparison with what I have just learned from Charlie Lee has been going on in the Academy for nearly a week. Charlie would not misrepresent matters to me, you know-unless to soften them; and, Mrs. Carrol-Nettie, he says that I am made the subject of merriment and ridicule in the gentlemen's department, and says that it is owing to Mr. Selden's having<pb n=""/> received love epistles, written in a lady's hand, and signed by 'Blanche Rathbone.' But Charlie believes me innocent, although he says the letters were conveyed in such a way as to induce the students to believe that they came from no other source but me. I know that neither you, Mrs. Carrol, nor you, Nettie, who know me so well, will for a moment conceive me capable of such an act. This is a great consolation to me; but to be thus shamefully maligned and insulted, and that in this public manner, without anyprovocation whatever. It causes me to feel wretched and indignant; I cannot, must not suffer this cruel wrong! I <emph>must</emph> defend myself, Mrs. Carrol, or what, O what am I to do? What steps shall I take, to shake off the false and wicked imputation?"</p> 
               <p>"Be calm, my dear, be calm," replied Mrs. Carrol, soothingly, and gently forcing the impulsive girl to resume her seat, from which, in the excitement of her feelings, she had risen unconsciously, and was standing before Mrs. Carrol with flushed face and flashing eye, from which all tears had disappeared.</p> 
               <p>"Strive to be as calm as possible; this is my first advice, and we will then counsel together. I am not prepared, without further reflection, to suggest the particular course that would be most proper for you to pursue; and yet, I feel with you that <emph>something</emph> should be done immediately, to relieve you from the disgraceful suspicions that will otherwise attach<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC5768-00000031"/> to you. Your statement, Blanche, has astonished me, although after Nettie had related to me the circumstance which occurred this afternoon, I felt assured that there must have been something to give rise to it of which you as well as ourselves were wholly ignorant.</p> 
               <p>"Have you any <emph>good</emph> reason for suspecting any of your school-mates?" continued Mrs. Carrol. "You know we must be very cautious about charging, even in our own minds, so grave an offence upon any person, unless the evidence be very strongly against them."</p> 
               <p>"Charlie Lee thinks," replied Blanche, whose excitement had now somewhat subsided, "that the letters were undoubtedly written by some of the school girls. I think so too; and yet, I cannot say that I have sufficient reason for suspecting any particular individual. Still, I cannot help thinking, that if any of them <emph>have</emph> been engaged in this affair, Ellen Trenton and the Edgeway girls will be found among the number. They have questioned me repeatedly about this Mr. Selden, and for some cause which I cannot comprehend, they have appeared to take delight in wounding my feelings for a long time past. Besides, I remember now, that Ellen Trenton was passing on the opposite side of the street, when Mr. Selden and myself left Mrs. McMillen's house together, on the day of our introduction. She saw him open the gate for me, and bow as I left him; and the next morning,-Nettie will recollect it-several anonymous notes<pb n=""/> were sent to me from different parts of the school-room, in which I was addressed as 'Mrs. Selden that is to-be;' or, 'the happy Mrs. Selden;' or, 'the would-be Mrs. Selden;' and congratulated on my success in making his acquaintance. I believed then, and yet do, that Ellen Trenton was the originator of these notes; though when I questioned her about them, she professed utter ignorance, and declared that she had neither written them herself, nor known of their existence until that moment."</p> 
               <p>"I feel pretty well satisfied in my own mind, that Ellen Trenton has been deeply engaged in this transaction," said Nettie; "also Elizabeth Edgeway and Bella Crawford; and I imagine that Susan Champell is not altogether ignorant upon the subject-I believe that she is, at least, in the secret."</p> 
               <p>"My daughter-my daughter!" exclaimed Mrs. Carrol, "be cautious how you seek to fasten suspicion, without great cause. You have often told me that you could never forget the advice Mr. Milford gave you upon leaving his school; but, I fear that the motto which you then adopted, 'To do in all things unto others as you would wish them to do unto you,' is not now in your mind."</p> 
               <p>Nettie's face colored slightly, her eyes moistened, and for a moment she was silent.</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps I <emph>have</emph> spoken too hastily, mother," she at length replied; "but I will tell you <emph>why</emph> I doubt them, and you will then judge whether I have had a reasonable foundation<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC5768-00000032"/> tion for my suspicions, or not. We know that <emph>some</emph> person or persons have written those letters; and we also know that such an affair would not naturally have been attempted, and could not easily have been carried out by a single individual. As we believe it originated in our school-room, we cannot, of course, consider <emph>all</emph> the young ladies innocent, and it is but natural to mistrust those against whom appearances are the strongest. Now, for a number of days past, I have often observed Ellen Trenton, Bella Crawford, and Elizabeth Edgeway in close conversation: latterly, they have been joined by Susan Champell; and all appeared to be in possession of some very amusing privacy. Once, I approached them, but as they did not continue the conversation, I presumed myself to be an intruder, and did not, therefore, again trouble them. This afternoon, as Blanche preferred finishing a composition to going out during recess, I, not feeling very sociable, sauntered out alone, and stopped under the shade of a large tree. I was just drawing a book from my pocket, with the design of reading a little, when I was joined by Ellen Trenton and Susan Champell.</p> 
               <p>"'Where is Elizabeth, Ellen?' said I; 'you have been so much together of late that you really look odd without her.'"</p> 
               <p>"'She said she couldn't come this afternoon,' replied Ellen, and then added, 'I don't think I can look stranger without <emph>her</emph> than <emph>you</emph> do without that Blanche Rathbone<pb n=""/> hanging to your arm. I can't for the life of me see what there is about <emph>her</emph> so very agreeable that you should like her so much better than the rest of us. I can't <emph>bear</emph> her for my part! Can you, Susan?'"</p> 
               <p>"'O, dont ask <emph>me!</emph>' said Susan, 'I don't care much about her one way or another.'"</p> 
               <p>"At that moment Bella Crawford came up to us with the note she had found. Of the conversation that followed I have already told you.</p> 
               <p>"If nothing further than this had occurred," continued Nettie, "I should of course think nothing of it; but by adding it to what Blanche has just related, I think we have <emph>just</emph> grounds for suspecting that if any of the school girls have been engaged in this business those are the ones."</p> 
               <p>"I confess that the circumstances you have mentioned, taken in connection with Blanche's story, would justify a suspicion," answered Mrs. Carrol. "Still they would hardly warrant an accusation; therefore, my daughter, I would advise you to say but little on the subject at present, except to declare your conviction of Blanche's innocence. And I think it would not be well for you, Blanche, to bring a charge against any individual in particular, until we shall have an opportunity to gather more positive proof of their guilt than can be adduced as yet; for to do so would not only increase the animosity of those already unfriendly to you, but through them would probably create for you new enemies without any<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC5768-00000033"/> corresponding benefit. The first step I would suggest as proper for you to take would be, to acquaint Miss Belmont with what has occurred; also, show her the note, and request her to investigate the matter. I know that she is naturally timid, and is very fearful of offending her scholars,-yet this would be so obvious a duty, that I believe she will not shrink from it. At all events, she is the most proper person to institute the inquiry which should be made, and you ought unhesitatingly to request her to do so. If she refuses-which I cannot think she will do-you will of course be obliged to adopt some other method. Meanwhile, my dear Blanche, endeavor to be calm, and do not let this prey upon your spirits. You will then be able to act with composure and decision when the proper time shall arrive; and be assured that I as well as Nettie will give you every necessary assistance that may be in our power."</p> 
               <p>At the request of Mrs. Carrol, Blanche now gave a more particular account of her conversation with Charlie Lee, after which, the hour getting late, she parted with an affectionate embrace from Mrs. Carrol and her daughter, and returned to her aunt's.</p> 
               <p>The next morning Blanche's head ached badly, for she had scarcely slept during the night. She persisted in going to school, however, notwithstanding her aunt advised her to remain at home; and even Kate-who had never before seen her cousin looking so wretched, and who, with her mother,<pb n=""/> attributed it to the complained-of headache-added her persuasions.</p> 
               <p>"I know, Blanche, it will make you worse to go to school with your head, and pore over the books as <emph>you</emph> usually do," she said. "You really look sick-perhaps its going to be something worse than a headache. Come-stay at home, and I will stay too, and read to you a first-rate story while you lie down."</p> 
               <p>"I am very much obliged to you, Kate," returned Blanche; "but I think the cool air will do me good. I shall feel better to go out than to remain at home; but if I find that I cannot study I will return."</p> 
               <p>"Well, then, if you <emph>must</emph> go, I'll go with you," said Kate.</p> 
               <p>"Are you sure you are well enough, my love?" asked the mother, anxiously.</p> 
               <p>"O yes, ma; I'm quite smart this morning," replied Kate, tying on her bonnet as she spoke. And surely her full, rosy face, gave abundant evidence of the truth of her words.</p> 
               <p>"It's dreadful dull staying at home, stretched out on a lounge, when one isn't sick," said Kate, when they were fairly in the street; "and if it wasn't for the dreadful lessons, I'd rather go to school by half. By-the-bye, Blanche, how did our chemistry class get along with their lesson yesterday.?"</p> 
               <p>"We didn't get along very well," returned Blanche; "this morning we are to take it over, with two or three new pages."</p> 
               <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC5768-00000034"/> 
               <p>"This morning? mercy on us! then I'm not going to school-that is settled!" exclaimed Kate. "I <emph>never</emph> could learn that lesson if I were to study on it with all my might for a month; and it makes me awful mad to have Miss Belmont look at me in the way she does when I make a mistake, and say, 'Miss Belton, how is it that you never have a perfect recitation?' I never should be able to repeat one word of <emph>this</emph> lesson I am sure, and don't mean to try neither. Dear me, how my side aches! you've walked too fast, Blanche. Come-let us turn around and go back. <emph>You</emph> can't be well enough to attend school to-day, I know. Come-will you?"</p> 
               <p>"I must go this morning at all events," replied Blanche; "but you need not go on my account, you know."</p> 
               <p>"What a little fool you are, Blanche! but I shall not make one of myself because you do-<emph>I'm</emph> going home. I don't feel so well as I did when we started. Besides, I forgot to give my bird fresh water this morning, and must go and attend to him now. I shall ask mother to give me some medicine for this pain in my side, and I don't believe she'll let me go to school to-day-so you may go on if you please."</p> 
               <p>Blanche was rather glad that her cousin had resolved to return home as she had told her nothing of her present trouble, and did not wish her to witness her interview with Miss Belmont; and otherwise would not have known how to rid herself of her company.</p>

               <p>BLANCHE RATHBONE had not the good fortune to reach the Academy in season to hold any conversation with Miss Belmont before the opening of the school, as she had hoped; but she soon found an opportunity of informing her teacher that she was very unhappy, and of requesting an interview during the time of recess. This was promised her, and Miss Belmont, noticing her pale and wan appearance, kindly offered to excuse her from any recitation for which she was not already prepared.</p> 
               <p>When the hour for recess arrived, all the young ladies left the school-room as usual, with the exception of Blanche and Nettie Carrol, who remained with her at her request.</p> 
               <p>Blanche told her story in a rapid, but clear and lucid manner, and cautiously avoided naming any of her schoolmates<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC5768-00000035"/> mates as objects of her suspicion. Miss Belmont appeared greatly surprised and distressed by her recital.</p> 
               <p>"I have never known so disgraceful a transaction to occur in any school of mine before," said she, "and I am exceedingly loth to believe now that such letters have originated in <emph>this</emph> department. Still, I sympathize with you most deeply, my dear Miss Rathbone, and would now assure you of my perfect confidence in your innocence; and if, after again conversing with Mr. Lee upon this subject, you have any good reasons for believing that the letters were written by any of <emph>my</emph> pupils, I will do what I can to investigate the matter. Until then, my dear, I would advise you to say nothing about it."</p> 
               <p>A glance at Blanche's face satisfied Nettie that her friend was not pleased with the turn matters had taken, and she was very far from being satisfied herself. She therefore ventured to inquire of Miss Belmont by whom she supposed the letters could have been written, if not by some of the young ladies in her school.</p> 
               <p>"I'm sure I do not know, my dear," replied the lady; "but we know the world is full of people who are utterly destitute of principle, and capable of almost any malicious act."</p> 
               <p>"But who is there <emph>out</emph> of this school, Miss Belmont, that bears Blanche any ill will?"</p> 
               <p>"Why, Miss Carrol! who is there <emph>in</emph> this school, that are unkindly disposed towards her?"</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"None that <emph>should</emph> be," replied Nettie warmly, "but there are those who <emph>are.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"I am sorry to hear it-<emph>very!</emph>" said Miss Belmont. "Miss Rathbone, do <emph>your</emph> suspicions rest upon any particular ladies in this school?"</p> 
               <p>"They do," returned Blanche; "but as I have no positive proof that they are guilty, I have resolved to accuse no one at present."</p> 
               <p>"Very wise, <emph>very</emph> wise, my dear, I am glad you have so much discretion. Miss Carrol will you have the kindness to pull the bell? the young ladies are having a long recess."</p> 
               <p>Nettie obeyed, and the conversation was not renewed.</p> 
               <p>Blanche remained at home that afternoon; her head ached too badly for her to think more of study. She sought repose, and finally succeeded in obtaining a refreshing sleep, which relieved her throbbing brow and soothed her troubled mind. Expecting that Charlie would call during the evening, and knowing that she would have no excuse for seeing him alone, unless her aunt and cousin should be first advised of the object of his call; and feeling that she would justly incur their censure, if she any longer withheld her confidence from them in a matter which she could not hope to conceal from them entirely, she resolved to relate the whole affair, as far as it had come to her knowledge, regardless of the consequences to herself.</p> 
               <p>"O dear!" exclaimed Mrs. Belton, when her niece had<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC5768-00000036"/> finished the narration, "what a scandalous affair this is. Pretty talk they'll have all over town at your expense! And I shouldn't wonder if almost everybody believed you wrote the letters; of course every one of the girls will deny knowing anything about it. I <emph>do</emph> wonder why you must be so imprudent as to express your opinion at all about that Selden."</p> 
               <p>"Why, aunt, I have said no more in his favor than others have; so that cannot be the cause of this strange treatment."</p> 
               <p>"No!" said Kate, "for I have said as much myself; and mother, it isn't two weeks since <emph>you</emph> said he was the handsomest young fellow in the place."</p> 
               <p>"Pshaw! child, you are mistaken; I never thought so, and I don't think I ever said so, either; but if <emph>you</emph> have ever said as much as your cousin, you have great reason to be thankful, as I am, that they didn't pitch upon you instead of Blanche. Dear me! I wonder what all this will come to, it just seems as if I never <emph>was</emph> to have any peace of my life, its trouble after trouble all the whole time: if it don't happen to be one thing, it's sure to be another. Oh! dear! what a constant care it is to have the charge of <emph>girls!</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"I guess, mother, if you had a couple of <emph>boys</emph> to look after for awhile, instead of us girls, you'd soon think you had never seen trouble before, and would be glad enough to change back again," said Kate tartly.</p> 
               <p>"Fie, Kate!" said Mrs. Belton, "don't be so ready to<pb n=""/> take everything to yourself. Nobody said but what <emph>you</emph> was well enough. I hope, in all conscience though, <emph>you</emph> will continue to keep on the right side of the girls, so that they won't go to playing off any of their games upon <emph>you!</emph> I declare this fuss makes me fairly nervous. Blanche, how <emph>did you</emph> offend them?"</p> 
               <p>"I am sure I cannot tell, aunt," replied Blanche. "I have never willingly laid so much as a straw in their way."</p> 
               <p>"You have written poetry though, you know, for compositions, most every week," said Kate; "and I know from what I have heard them say, some of the girls don't like it in you at all?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, that's it!" exclaimed her mother; "I <emph>do</emph> wonder why you must write so much poetry; it looks just as if you wanted to show them that you could do something they couldn't; and as if you thought yourself something wonderful. Now Kate <emph>never tries</emph> to teaze them in that way, but always writes in prose when she writes at all; and I must say, I think <emph>her</emph> course the most prudent."</p> 
               <p>Blanche, though accustomed to censure from her aunt, and, in the present instance, confidently expecting it, was, in spite of her previous resolutions to the contrary, becoming quite excited, when Mrs. Belton uttered her last remark and completely changed the current of her feelings. The idea that Kate had refrained from writing poetical compositions on account of prudential considerations, was so extremely<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC5768-00000037"/> ludicrous, that her anger instantaneously subsided, and gave place to a mirth which she could with difficulty conceal or subdue.</p> 
               <p>"No, aunt, I never knew Kate to attempt so much as a couplet," she replied, endeavoring to look quite grave; "so in that respect she is less guilty than I."</p> 
               <p>"I wouldn't write poetry on any account," said Kate, "or stories either. I've no doubt but I could do both first-rate, if I should try; for I don't believe it takes any great knack to do it. I'd rather read stories than write 'em, any day; but as for poetry, I don't approve of it, I don't like it at all! So mother, you needn't be at all afraid of my writing any very soon. Blanche does it, I believe, on purpose to plague the girls."</p> 
               <p>"I write it solely for my own pleasure and improvement," answered Blanche, "and because it is easier for me than any other kind of composition. I love poetry!" she continued, with increased animation; "how could I help it, when the earth, the air, the sky, birds, flowers, all, everything is filled with poetry! And if Heaven has given me the talent to comprehend and appreciate this vast poem, who can have any just right to quarrel with me for its cultivation?"</p> 
               <p>Blanche paused.</p> 
               <p>"The speech is ended!" exclaimed Kate, lifting up her hands and eyes with a tragic air, "couldn't you favor us with such another?"</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>At that moment the door bell was heard. "Charlie Lee, I suppose," said Blanche, rising, "shall <emph>I</emph> go?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes," returned Mrs. Belton, "Hannah is very busy."</p> 
               <p>"If he enquires for me, after you get through with your privacy, just tell him I'm engaged," said Kate, "for I don't like him-I mean, I can't bear him."</p> 
               <p>"I do wish, my love," said the mother, as soon as Blanche had left the room, "I do wish that you would try and break yourself of this habit of speaking so decidedly. It is really very ungenteel. A lady should never be very decided about <emph>anything,</emph> for besides being considered vulgar, it is sure to make her enemies. I'm afraid, my dear, if you practice it at home, you'll forget yourself sometimes when you are out."</p> 
               <p>"Trust me for that, mother," replied Kate, with an expressive toss of the head; "I'm as teachable and as full of 'I don't knows,' when out in company as any gentleman could ask. I understand my P's and Q's pretty well, I can tell you, mother."</p> 
               <p>"I am glad to hear you say so, my child. I see you <emph>have</emph> pretty correct ideas after all, and I've no doubt you will be able to make a first-rate match, if you only keep on this course. I want you to marry young, my dear-<emph>I</emph> did, though I was perhaps a little <emph>too</emph> young; I wasn't much older than you are now; but then, girls went out into a company a good deal younger than they do here, and in those times they were not expected to make such a show of getting an education. Of<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC5768-00000038"/> course I don't want you to marry under a couple of years yet, but as soon after you are fairly out in general society as you well can, I would wish you to marry. I would like to have it said that the prize had hardly appeared before it was snatched and carried away."</p> 
               <p>"But maybe, mother, they'd say I wasn't very particular, and jumped at the first chance."</p> 
               <p>"No they won't, child; there wouldn't hardly any body take <emph>that</emph> view of it; and if they did, I wouldn't care a bit. If you get such notions as that into your head, it's ten to one you never'll marry, and I wouldn't have you an old maid for all the world! Everybody thinks them tiresome and disagreeable; and, as I have often told you, they are always looked upon as a disappointed sour set, and are really despised. Mercy on us! I don't know what I <emph>should</emph> do, if you were to be an old maid."</p> 
               <p>"But I sha'n't, mother, for I hate old maids. Miss Belmont is one, and I can't endure her. But, mother," continued Kate, with a roguish twinkle of her eye, "what if it should happen after all that I couldn't get anybody to have me?"</p> 
               <p>"Nonsense, Kate! if you're not a fool you <emph>can</emph> get somebody, and if you <emph>are</emph> you can; the thing is to make a <emph>good</emph> match. <emph>That</emph> is not so very easy a matter; but it is what I wish you to do, that is, to marry some genteel person who goes in fashionable society, and will be able to support you well. When you are out of school and make your debut into<pb n=""/> society, I shall see that nothing in the way of dress is wanting to set you off to advantage; and then, I think if you manage properly, there will be no difficulty in the matter.</p> 
               <p>"I warn you now, however," continued Mrs. Belton, decidedly, "that it will not do for you to get into a way of appearing to think too much for yourself; you will naturally have a mind of your own, of course, but what I mean is, that you mus'n't <emph>appear</emph> to have; and then, as I just told you, it won't do to be too decided in your language; for either of these things would be esteemed faults by the gentlemen, and would be great stumbling blocks in the way of your success. To be sure, there are a <emph>few</emph> men who like decision of character in ladies, but they are so <emph>very</emph> few that it would be dangerous for you to exhibit such qualities, unless you were very certain of the company you were in. The great majority prefer ladies with meek, yielding dispositions, that can be led around like a-like a-well! like a little kitten! They have an idea that such women make the best wives, because they are more easily managed."</p> 
               <p>"I sha'nt let <emph>my</emph> husband manage <emph>me!</emph>" exclaimed Kate, with much spirit. "I'm not going to mind him in everything, and be led around by the nose like a dog, I'll be bound for it!"</p> 
               <p>"For pity sake, don't breathe such thoughts out loud!" exclaimed the mother in alarm. "It might ruin your prospects<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC5768-00000039"/> pects for the future forever. Let your husband at least <emph>think</emph> he is going to manage you as easily as he could a kitten until he is once fastened; then, if you like, you can show him that you have a will of your own as well as he!"</p> 
               <p>While this interesting dialogue was in progress between mother and daughter, Blanche and Charlie Lee were engaged in earnest conversation in the parlor. Blanche related to young Lee the substance of her interview with Mrs. Carrol and her daughter, and also her conversation with Miss Belmont; while Charlie, in his turn, gave her an account of the method by which the letters had been conveyed to young Selden.</p> 
               <p>The principal apartment occupied by the young ladies of the academy was on the second floor of the building, and directly above that occupied by the gentlemen. The seat appropriated to Blanche, was close by a window; and exactly underneath it, by a corresponding window, she now learned for the first time that Mr. Selden's desk was situated. The letters, Charlie said, he had been informed were attached to a cord which was fastened a little on one side of the upper window, and was of sufficient length to reach the sill of the window below, and in this way were conveyed to the young gentleman. That Blanche occupied the desk directly over Mr. Selden's was by some means or other well understood by the students, and they were consequently more firm in their belief that the letters were from her. Blanche<pb n=""/> thought it impossible almost for any one to have forwarded the letters in the manner described without her knowledge, as the casement was seldom raised by herself or others; and of late, she had not noticed any of the young ladies in its vicinity. She thought it quite possible, however, that they might have been lowered from another window not far from her seat which was almost constantly open, and was frequently resorted to by the girls, as the desk near it had not yet been appropriated by any particular person.</p> 
               <p>"I had a few minutes' conversation with Henry Selden to-day," said Charlie, "during which I informed him of your positive denial of the authorship of the letters, and of my firm conviction of your innocence. I also inquired of him, whether he was quite certain that they had been lowered from your window. He replied, that he was confident they were; and in spite of all that I could say, he persisted in believing, or affecting to believe, that they were the work of your hands. I then requested him to loan me the last epistle he had received that I might show it to you, but was promptly refused. He said he would read it to me, and I might see it if I wished, but that he would not consent to let it go out of his possession. After listening to the reading of <emph>that</emph> letter, Blanche, I had no further desire of exhibiting it to you-and it was with difficulty I could refrain from striking young Selden to the ground for professing to believe that you were its author. I told him plainly, that there would<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC5768-00000040"/> be an investigation of the matter; for which, he coolly replied, 'he was ready.'"</p> 
               <p>Charlie then informed Blanche that he would be obliged to leave town the next day, to be absent a week or more on some business for his father; but advised her to persevere in demanding an investigation-and if Miss Belmont refused to act promptly in the matter, to seek an interview with Mr. Castlebury; relate to him all the phases of this unpleasant transaction, and request his assistance. Blanche promised to follow his suggestions, soon after which the young man took his leave.</p>

               <p>THE next morning, Blanche succeeded in reaching the academy in time to speak with Miss Belmont before school opened. She then assured her teacher of her full conviction that the letters were written by some of her pupils, and earnestly requested her immediate endeavors to ferret out the guilty parties.</p> 
               <p>Miss Belmont professed herself deeply grieved that any in her school should have been engaged in so disgraceful an affair, and promised to give the subject her earliest attention.</p> 
               <p>Several of the school-girls passed in and out, while Blanche and her teacher were talking; and before noon their entire conversation had been repeated, with sundry additions, and quite an excitement among the pupils was the consequence<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC5768-00000041"/> quence. Notes were written and exchanged between them, whenever it could be done without a prospect of detection; and when school was over for the morning, the excited ones quickly grouped themselves together and conversed in low but anxious tones as they slowly left the academy grounds.</p> 
               <p>The day passed away without any visible attempt on the part of Miss Belmont to fulfil her engagement, and both Nettie and Blanche went home dissatisfied and disappointed.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Champell's residence was only a short distance from Mrs. Belton's, and Blanche and her cousin had been in the habit of running over quite frequently to see Susan, and had always been treated by the family with consideration and kindness. Several days had now elapsed since Blanche had called, and this evening-feeling too much dispirited to engage in her ordinary occupations, and thinking it possible she might there hear of something connected with the mystery which was causing her so much uneasiness that would contribute to its elucidation-she resolved to drop in upon them for a little while, as had been her wont.</p> 
               <p>Mr. and Mrs. Champell were sitting together in their back parlor when Blanche was shown into the room. Both bowed coldly in answer to her "Good evening," and Mrs. Champell stiffly requested her to be seated.</p> 
               <p>Blanche, though astonished and pained by this singular reception, silently accepted the offered chair, and for two or three minutes not a word was spoken upon either side. Mr.<pb n=""/> Champell appeared to be absorbed in the contents of a newspaper which he had just taken up, and his wife seemed equally engrossed with an intricate piece of needle-work, which apparently required very close attention at that particular moment; it must have been very trying to her patience also, for her lips were closely compressed, and the muscles so contracted as to give her countenance an expression of extreme displeasure. Blanche felt that this strange conduct was intended for her benefit; and was becoming every instant, more and more chagrined and even angry. The silence to her felt terrible, but her embarrassment was so great, and a certain choking sensation about the throat seemed to increase so much, that she dared not trust herself to attempt to utter a syllable. Still, she could not continue much longer in her present mortifying position, and had just resolved upon leaving the house without attempting any remark, when Mrs. Champell addressed her, though without lifting her eyes from her work.</p> 
               <p>"How is your aunt this evening, Miss Rathbone?" she said.</p> 
               <p>"Very well," answered Blanche, with as much composure as she was able to assume, "is Susan at home?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes," was the laconic reply, followed by a pause.</p> 
               <p>"Can I see her? is she disengaged?" Blanche at length found courage to ask.</p> 
               <p>"I suppose you can, if you wish it <emph>particularly,</emph>" replied<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC5768-00000042"/> Mrs. Champell, emphasizing strongly on the word, "but if not, I do not wish her interrupted, as she is at present engaged with her lessons; is it important that you should see her?"</p> 
               <p>"Not at all," said Blanche, rising quickly from her chair, "I merely came in to make a friendly call, supposing I should receive a friendly welcome as heretofore; or, at least, be treated with respect, but I have found myself mistaken."</p> 
               <p>"When a young lady conducts in such a way as to deprive herself of all just claims to respectability, she must not complain if she is not treated with respect and attention by her former friends," said Mrs. Champell with much dignity.</p> 
               <p>"When a young lady writes love-letters to a strange young gentleman, she ought to be pretty certain that <emph>he</emph> will not show them, or <emph>she</emph> be found out; especially if her letters are not of a readable character," added Mr. Champell, laying down his paper and looking Blanche steadily in the face.</p> 
               <p>"Three days ago, such language as this would have been utterly incomprehensible," returned Blanche, without quailing under or seeking to avoid the keen gaze that was still fixed upon her; "but <emph>now</emph> I know its import too well; I had not thought, I confess, that either of <emph>you</emph> would pronounce me guilty of this thing, without first giving me an opportunity of vindicating myself from the calumny."</p> 
               <p>"We know of nothing that <emph>could</emph> be said in your defence," said Mrs. Champell, "for Susan and nearly all the school-girls<pb n=""/> say there is no doubt as to who wrote the letters; indeed I have heard but one opinion expressed on the subject."</p> 
               <p>"May I ask how long it is since you first heard this story of me?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes," returned Mrs. Champell; "I think it must be nearly a week since a report reached me to the effect that Harry Selden was receiving written communications from you; but I regarded it only as a baseless rumor, until about three days ago, when I was credibly informed that the rumor was perfectly correct, and was also made acquainted with the character of those epistles; and of course, I wish my daughter to see as little as possible of a person capable of such misconduct, to call it by no harsher name, as that of which you are charged."</p> 
               <p>"And falsely charged!" exclaimed Blanche with energy, now thoroughly roused to the humiliation of her position, "Mr. Champell-Mrs. Champell, hear me! You have listened to those who have dared to circulate these base and slanderous falsehoods, and now as an act of simple justice, I ask you to give ear to what <emph>I</emph> have to say. I solemnly declare that I never penned <emph>one</emph> of those letters! I never <emph>saw</emph> one of them; and but for Charlie Lee, I believe I should not have known of their existence until this very hour!"</p> 
               <p>"Are you certainly speaking the truth, my child?" asked Mr. Champell gravely; "remember it is a fearful thing to utter a falsehood knowingly; if you have fallen into error,<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC5768-00000043"/> meet the consequences with what courage you are able, but do not make that error more criminal by adding to it an untruth, even if by so doing you were certain of clearing yourself in the eyes of the world."</p> 
               <p>"Anything that Blanche Rathbone would <emph>do,</emph> she would not hesitate to <emph>acknowledge!</emph>" returned Blanche proudly and indignantly. "No, Mr. Champell, as I live, as He lives who made me-I say it reverently-I have uttered nothing but the truth! Three days ago, not even a rumor of this infamous affair had reached my ears. Will you listen to me? I will tell you all that I know of it. Shall I proceed?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly, certainly!" exclaimed both Mr. and Mrs. Champell, almost in the same instant-they were becoming rapidly convinced that there were two sides even to <emph>this</emph> story; "but first be seated," continued the former, rising and conducting Blanche to a seat which his wife had just placed for her beside herself.</p> 
               <p>"Speak with perfect freedom," added Mrs. Champell, in a milder tone than that in which she had before accosted the orphan girl. "Perhaps we <emph>have</emph> been a little too hasty in our judgment," she continued, "I really hope the result will prove that we, instead of you, have been in the wrong."</p> 
               <p>Blanche now related in a clear and concise, but earnest manner, the substance of her story, as she had before given it to her aunt, and the course she had taken with regard to it, thus far; and so truthful did her every word appear, that<pb n=""/> Mr. and Mrs. Champell hastened, as soon as she had finished, to assure her of their full and entire confidence, and to applaud her for the course she had pursued. They also counselled her to follow the advice of Charlie Lee, and see Mr. Castlebury upon the subject, in case Miss Belmont should render such a course necessary.</p> 
               <p>The next day, Mr. Selden's love letters formed the main topic of conversation with the school-girls; and Ellen Trenton and Elizabeth Edgeway went so far as to assure Blanche that they had heard of the business from the beginning through several of the students, and that nothing she could say would ever <emph>convince them</emph> that she did not write and send the letters.</p> 
               <p>"We <emph>know</emph> you wrote them! so you needn't deny it any more," said Ellen.</p> 
               <p>"Who <emph>could</emph> have written them if you did not?" asked Elizabeth. "I should really like to know who you think of laying it to?" she added.</p> 
               <p>"If she wants to hit upon the right person, she'll lay it to the young lady that received a note from Peter Finglefolger the other day," said Ellen.</p> 
               <p>Blanche was now burning with indignation, and her cheeks crimsoned and her eye flashed as she answered them.</p> 
               <p>"Young ladies!" she said, "you well know that you are giving utterance to the most outrageous of falsehoods, when you make such assertions. I have no question indeed but<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC5768-00000044"/> that, as you say, you <emph>have</emph> been aware of this transaction from the very commencement; for I firmly believe, it owes its origin to some of you. How dare you say that you believe <emph>me</emph> guilty in this matter? You <emph>do not!</emph> you <emph>know</emph> to the contrary! You know that Miss Belmont herself has been as much engaged in this exceedingly <emph>honorable</emph> and <emph>lady-like</emph> affair as <emph>I</emph> have been:" and Blanche, as she said the last word, turned her back upon them and proceeded to Miss Belmont's desk, where that lady was apparently deeply engaged with her pen.</p> 
               <p>The conversation we have just-related, occurred in the school-room during recess-for the day was unpleasant, and but few of the pupils had left the room-and so near to where Miss Belmont was seated that she could scarcely have avoided hearing every word. She however, was so fully absorbed in the writing before her, that she did not seem to observe Blanche until she was close by at her side.</p> 
               <p>"Miss Belmont," said Blanche, in a voice trembling with excitement, "may I ask whether you have taken any measures yet, towards bringing about the investigation we were speaking of?"</p> 
               <p>"Indeed, Miss Rathbone, I have been very much occupied since I conversed with you," responded her teacher with some embarrassment; "consequently, I have not been able to take any steps to accomplish your desires. I have thought of it a good deal, however-and I really cannot see<pb n=""/> that it is in my power to render you any material assistance. I am <emph>very</emph> sorry that this thing has occurred, but what can <emph>I</emph> do now that it is <emph>done?</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"You can inform Mr. Castlebury,-demand of him the letters, and call the young ladies of your own school to an account, I suppose!" returned Blanche with much bitterness.</p> 
               <p>"What good would it do, if I should?" said Miss Belmont, in a low voice; "the young ladies who have been in anyway engaged in this transaction, would undoubtedly deny it if charged upon them; and as we have nothing but circumstantial evidence to produce against <emph>any</emph> of them, it would be almost impossible to discover the true offender: besides, it would create a great excitement in the school, and if no one was proven guilty it would be much more unpleasant for yourself than if you had remained perfectly quiet. I think, my dear, if I were you, I would keep as calm as I was able, and pay little or no attention to the affair: for if <emph>you</emph> say nothing about it-except of course to deny, when necessary to do so, having had any agency in it-the story will soon die away and be forgotten."</p> 
               <p>"Keep calm!" exclaimed Blanche, with so much energy as to startle Miss Belmont; "keep calm, indeed! and make myself dumb, that those whom I have never injured may heap insults upon me with impunity-may tear my character to pieces-vilify my good name, and rejoice undisputed in my unmerited disgrace! Never-never! You do not know<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC5768-00000045"/> me, Miss Belmont, if you think me so tame as to submit to such ignominy. I <emph>will not</emph> be silent! I will myself investigate it-if need be, alone and unaided. I will not rest until I have fathomed it to its very foundation! I cannot suffer the disgrace of this false charge, for false it is, and false I will <emph>prove</emph> it to be!"</p> 
               <p>"And I will stand by you-let what <emph>will</emph> come!" said Nettie, stepping out from the group of listening girls whom Blanche's excited tones had collected, "I will stand by you always, and do all that <emph>I</emph> can to aid you!" and Nettie clasped her friend's trembling hands in her own and raised them affectionately to her lips.</p> 
               <p>Miss Belmont, whose face had become almost colorless during Blanche's passionate exclamation, now rallied herself, and called the school to order.</p> 
               <p>"I am sorry to see you exhibit so much feeling, my dear," she whispered in Blanche's ear, as the latter was passing her on her way to her seat, "and I sincerely hope that a little reflection will convince you of its impropriety."</p> 
               <p>Soon after the exercises of the day were over, Blanche and Nettie, after first consulting with Mrs. Carrol, proceeded to Mr. Castlebury's residence, taking with them several specimens of Blanche's penmanship. Fortunately they found Mr. Castlebury at home, and disengaged. The young girls soon disclosed the purpose of their visit. Mr. Castlebury listened attentively to their statements, and assured them of<pb n=""/> his sympathy, and also of his determination to do all within his province to assist their efforts. He had observed, he said, an uncommon degree of merriment among a portion of the students for some time past, but had thought little of it, not supposing that any evil was connected with it. He also expressed himself deeply grieved, as well as surprised, that any one under his charge should have been engaged in any thing so dishonorable. He would institute, he promised, an inquiry immediately, and, if possible, obtain possession of the letters.</p> 
               <p>Blanche then offered to exhibit the specimens of her hand-writing which she had brought with her, and to leave them in his possession that he might compare them with the letters received by Mr. Selden should he succeed in obtaining them, and thus satisfy himself of the truth of her asservations.</p> 
               <p>"It will not be at all necessary, Miss Rathbone," returned Mr. Castlebury, "for I am fully convinced that you could not tell me such a tale, with such a truthful face, and be guilty; no! Miss Rathbone, I believe all you have said, and could not, if I wished it, do otherwise."</p> 
               <p>Blanche thanked him for his confidence in her, but still urged him so strongly to examine her specimens of writing, that he at length so far complied as to glance hastily over them, but steadily refused to retain them in his possession.</p>

               <p>AS Blanche and her cousin were on their way to school, the next morning after the orphan's interview with Mr. Castlebury, Mrs. Crawford opened the street door just as they were going by her house, and requested them to call in for a moment, as she had something special to say to Blanche. It being yet early the two girls complied.</p> 
               <p>"You see I wanted to tell you something," began Mrs. Crawford, turning to Blanche when the girls were seated, "and I didn't want Bell-Arabell to hear, and so I packed her and little Flotty off to school real early this morning, on purpose to have 'em out of the way. You see Blanche," she continued, "I can't help knowing what's been going on in the Ac-ademy this good while, for it's gitting to be town talk, and I can't shet my ears no more'n any other body; but of<pb n=""/> Course I don't believe everything I hear-I know too much for that I reckon-and I don't believe you ever writ them letters in the world, and I guess Arabella don't much think you did either; but she says it won't do for her to come straight out and say so, for it would make her some real bad enemies if she did, and I think so too; now what I was going to say is, that I heard you was going to sift the disturbance to the bottom if it took your life. Ellen Trenton and Lib Edgeway was here last night, and they said you took on like a crazy person about it to school yesterday, and most scared Miss Belmont into fits. They said they was sure they didn't <emph>know</emph> whether you writ the letters or not, but they had always thought you <emph>did;</emph> but whether you did or not, they thought the best thing <emph>you</emph> could do would be to keep still, and let the thing die a nat'ral death like, of its own accord and of itself, and they wanted me to advise you as a friend to jest let the thing drop, for they and Bell too thinks 'the more you rake it the worse you'll make it,' and I'm thinking it would turn out pretty much jest so, in my opinion; they say you can't prove you didn't write 'em, and you can't <emph>prove</emph> who <emph>did,</emph> unless you own 'em yourself, and that you're in a bad fix any way you turn it; and they told me to tell you, from myself, if you'd keep still, that I didn't think that much more would be said about it, but that nothing was ever gained by stirring muddy water.</p> 
               <p>"Now Blanche I <emph>must</emph> say," resumed Mrs. Crawford after<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC5768-00000047"/> a short pause to recover her breath, "I think, for my part, it would be a deal better for you in the long run, jest to let the thing go, now don't you think so too, all things calculated on?"</p> 
               <p>"I am much obliged to you for your advice," returned Blanche rising, "but have already decided on what course to pursue, and cannot change it now. Come Kate, let us be going. You may say to the young ladies, Mrs. Crawford," she continued, "that I am extremely obliged to them for their <emph>disinterested</emph> kindness."</p> 
               <p>"And know <emph>exactly</emph> how to appreciate it," added Kate as they left the house.</p> 
               <p>School had commenced when Blanche and her cousin reached the Academy, but no fault was found with them for their tardiness. Miss Belmont was looking very grave, and her pupils were unusually quiet. During recess, Nettie informed Blanche that Miss Belmont had that morning lectured the scholars on the subjects of Envy, Malice and Evil-speaking; had enlarged upon the evil tendency of those passions and propensities of the heart; and had ended by strictly forbidding any of her pupils to exhibit any such traits while within the walls of the Academy, under pain of expulsion and disgrace.</p> 
               <p>Nothing was said or done through the day to annoy Blanche; on the contrary several of the young ladies, some of whom had made themselves exceedingly disagreeable<pb n=""/> hitherto, were now becoming unusually respectful in their bearing towards her. This change Blanche attributed partly to Miss Belmont's lecture, and partly to a desire on their part to divert her, if possible, from any farther attempts at examination into a matter which it was evident they would be glad to have forgotten.</p> 
               <p>That evening Blanche received a visit from Mr. Castlebury. "I have called," said he, "for the purpose of acquainting you with the result, thus far, of my efforts to obtain an insight into this singular affair. I regret to say that I have not been able to render you the assistance I had anticipated; for I have failed entirely to obtain, even so much as a view of the letters which have occasioned you so much unhappiness. This afternoon I questioned Mr. Selden closely on the subject, in the presence of some of the students with whom he is intimate. He appeared much embarrassed, but acknowledged that he had received such communications, and professed to believe that you had written them. I assured him of my full persuasion that you had never addressed a line to him, and that he had greatly mistaken your character if he really supposed you capable of such an indiscretion. I then requested him to produce the letters. He asked for what purpose I desired them. I answered that I wished first to examine them myself, and then to deliver them to you, in the hope that the perusal of their contents or their chirography might furnish a clue for the detection of their authorship."</p> 
               <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC5768-00000048"/> 
               <p>"'If Miss Rathbone wrote the letters,' Selden replied to me, 'she is already aware of their contents; if she did not, she would feel better to remain in ignorance. No, Mr. Castlebury, I cannot deliver them to you.'</p> 
               <p>"But you <emph>must,</emph> Mr. Selden,' I returned; 'I <emph>demand</emph> them from you, as your teacher. I also demand them in the name of the young girl who has been so cruelly traduced through them. I insist upon your producing the papers immediately.'</p> 
               <p>"'They are not in my possession, sir,' said Selden, 'therefore I cannot deliver them to you.'</p> 
               <p>"Then where are they?' I demanded.</p> 
               <p>"'Destroyed, sir-reduced to ashes!'</p> 
               <p>"'How is this?' I asked, eyeing him sternly.</p> 
               <p>"The young man reddened, but answered without hesitation, 'I found they were making a great disturbance, sir, and thought it best to put them out of the way.'</p> 
               <p>"I hardly think," continued Mr. Castlebury to Blanche, "I hardly think that the papers are really destroyed-still it is possible that they may be; but if not, I cannot see any prospect of being able to procure them for you; for I reproved the students who had been engaged in circulating this story so severely this afternoon, that I presume the letters, if still in existence, will not again be exhibited in Ellville. I regret exceedingly that it is not in my power to obtain them for you; for without them I fear it will be almost impossible<pb n=""/> possible to <emph>prove</emph> your innocence clearly, or fix the stigma of this base transaction upon the guilty perpetrators who richly deserve the infamy with which it would cover them. I also fear, Miss Rathbone, that any further effort on your part, <emph>at present,</emph> to agitate the matter, would prove utterly fruitless: still, if you think otherwise, and I can be of any assistance, call upon me without hesitation."</p> 
               <p>Blanche listened painfully to the end, and notwithstanding the struggle which it cost her feelings, she was forced to acquiesce in the correctness of Mr. Castlebury's conclusions. She thanked him over and over again for his kindness, reluctantly acknowledging that she could see no feasible way of prosecuting the matter further with any present hope of success.</p> 
               <p>A few days after this visit from Mr. Castlebury, Charlie Lee, who had but recently returned from his journey, dropped in to see Blanche at her aunt's. While relating to him the events that had transpired in connection with herself during his absence, she mentioned the assertion of Selden regarding his disposition of the letters.</p> 
               <p>"It is false!" exclaimed Charlie. "This very day I heard him acknowledge to a young friend that they were still in his possession."</p> 
               <p>Blanche resolved immediately to make another effort to obtain the letters, or at least to secure a reading of them; and with this view determined to demand them of young<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC5768-00000049"/> Selden in person, on the first suitable opportunity. An occasion offered itself much sooner than she had anticipated.</p> 
               <p>The students, boarders of Mrs. McMillen, who could not be accommodated with lodgings at her house, had hired a large room in a building not far from Mrs. Belton's residence, which apartment served them both for a study and a sleeping room. The well from which these young gentlemen were accustomed to obtain their supply of water, was situated in a pleasant lane upon the premises of Mrs. Belton's nearest neighbor, and within a few rods of Mrs. Belton's house. Many of the wells in Elville had become exhausted from the long, dry season; and Mrs. Belton, among others, was latterly compelled to resort to the fountain at her neighbor's, for this necessary of life. Blanche had taken a pitcher in hand one afternoon, not long after Charlie Lee's call, and started for the well; when, upon entering the lane from her aunt's house, she descried Mr. Selden approaching from the opposite direction, also bearing a pitcher in his hand, and evidently upon the same errand as herself. He slackened his pace upon perceiving Blanche, that she might have opportunity to fill her vessel and withdraw before he should come up. Blanche, however, who saw his design, was purposely so slow in accomplishing this that he could not avoid a meeting without turning back or absolutely standing still. He bowed slightly to Blanche as she stepped from the platform surrounding<pb n=""/> rounding the well, and evidently wished himself anywhere rather than in her presence.</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Selden," said Blanche, returning his bow with another equally frigid, "I desire to speak with you a moment."</p> 
               <p>The young man colored, and bowed even more slightly than before, but made no reply.</p> 
               <p>"I have understood, sir," proceeded Blanche, "that you have received several letters within the last two weeks, purporting to have been written by myself; and concerning the authenticity of which, you have professed to entertain no doubts. Is this statement correct?"</p> 
               <p>Mr. Selden bowed still again without speaking.</p> 
               <p>"May I ask then, sir, what reason you have for believing that <emph>I</emph> would address letters of affection, or indeed any letters to <emph>you?</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Young ladies do a great many things that are not easily accounted for," replied the gentleman, accompanying his words with a very perceptible curl of the lip.</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Selden, <emph>you</emph> can believe me or not as best pleases you," said Blanche, with warmth, "but heaven will bear me witness to the truth of what I say when I tell you that Blanche Rathbone has never penned a line to you, sir, nor even addressed you in thought. I did not consider myself acquainted with you, and moreover have not had the slightest wish to become so. Why then, sir, should I send you letters expressive of a regard that had never been awakened? But<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC5768-00000050"/> it was not my purpose," she continued, "to detain you here, to listen to reiterated denials of a slanderous tale which you insult me by believing I come to ask of you, as a gentleman bound in honor to comply with my request, to deliver me the letters of the authorship of which I am accused, or at least to grant me their perusal. If I have written them, it is my right to demand their return; if I have not, I am certainly entitled to know the full meaning of that with which I am charged,-and sir, if you are a gentleman, you will not deny my request. The letters, I <emph>know,</emph> are still in your possession. Will you return them?"</p> 
               <p>"I cannot, Miss Rathbone, indeed I cannot," answered Selden, in a manner more respectful, for the proud bearing and indignant tone of the young girl almost awed him, while it shakened his confidence in his first conclusions. "You must excuse me from this," he continued, "the letters are not fit to be read by a lady. If you penned them, you are already aware of their nature, if you did not, I would not for the world place them before you."</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Selden," said Blanche, turning pale at the thought of the grossness which his language seemed ambiguously to convey, "I know it is not delicate for a lady to volunteer sentiments of affection for a gentleman, unsolicited, even if that gentleman were no stranger to her; from what I have heard of these letters, I suppose them to be effusions of this<pb n=""/> character; am I to understand from your words that they are in any other sense indelicate?"</p> 
               <p>"They certainly are, Miss Rathbone, not only indelicate, but vulgar."</p> 
               <p>"And yet you thought <emph>me</emph> capable of writing them, Mr. Selden?"</p> 
               <p>"I did not doubt it until now, for I had no reason to attribute their origin to any other source. I am not acquainted with any of Miss Belmont's pupils, never having had an introduction to any other than yourself."</p> 
               <p>Blanche sighed heavily. Her anger was vanishing and giving place to hopeless sorrow, as the prospect of unravelling the mystery grew fainter.</p> 
               <p>"Is there not one letter among them all that you would be willing to let me peruse?" she asked sadly.</p> 
               <p>"No, not one," replied the young man. "There is not one but would make you blush were you indeed incapable of its composition. I will not let you see them, Miss Rathbone, but I pledge you my honor as a gentleman, that they shall be destroyed immediately."</p> 
               <p>"And can you still believe me guilty of this thing, Mr. Selden?"</p> 
               <p>"I doubt it much <emph>now,</emph> but of course do not <emph>know,</emph>" was the harsh and equivocal reply.</p> 
               <p>Blanche left him and returned to the house disappointed and miserable. It was a long time before she could reconcile<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC5768-00000051"/> herself to let matters pass without any further action on her part; but as there could be in reality no other course left for her to pursue, she yielded at length to a necessity that seemed inevitable.</p> 
               <p>Gradually the numerous and varied reports that were afloat in the village in relation to the affair, died away, leaving many fully convinced of the innocence of the orphan, and perhaps as many more quite as firmly established in their confidence of her guilt. The subject was also apparently dropped by the school girls, and forgotten. Sundry little gifts, in the form of needle-books, pin-cushions or book-marks, were lavishly bestowed upon Blanche, by those whom she had most strongly suspected of the conspiracy against her. Blanche had not the heart to refuse these peace-offerings, for it was not in her nature to harbor revengeful feeling or to remain long gloomy, and she soon met her companions with as much kindness, and appeared to be as cheerful and light-hearted as ever.</p> 
               <p>But this, her first great lesson in human depravity, had occasioned her too much mental suffering to be easily forgotten. Could she have clearly established her innocence, and exposed the guilty, she felt that she could have borne her trials with comparative resignation; but to know that in the eyes of many she continued to stand condemned of an act at which her very soul revolted and shrunk from the bare idea, made it difficult indeed to derive consolation from the exercise of<pb n=""/> that Christian virtue. Still she so far yielded to the sympathies of her friends and their endeavors to divert her mind from dwelling upon her griefs, as to repress as much as possible this tendency, and to comfort herself with the <emph>hope</emph> that all was in some way for the best.</p> 
               <p>Were this book an entire fiction, dear reader, we would most certainly have had the perpetrators of this dark transaction discovered, and brought to punishment. But alas! in real life how many innocent persons are made to suffer reproach, and are disgraced for offences they have never committed; and go down, mayhap, to their narrow homes with their wrongs unacknowledged and unavenged; while the guilty pass through life, smiled upon and caressed by the world, with no other accuser than their own consciences. Well-well! "He who holdeth the Heavens in His hand, and counteth the stars thereof; who regardeth the children of men, and suffereth not a hair of their head to fall to the ground without His knowledge, hath declared that He will in no wise clear the guilty;" therefore we know that a day of retribution will, sooner or later, come to all, even though it hath not its dawning upon the shores of time.</p>

               <p>"WHAT a delightful morning! the air is soft and balmy, and comes over the meadows laden with the delicious fragrance of spring-flowers! not a cloud darkens the sky, and the groves are alive with birds, rivalling each other in the fulness and sweetness of their melody!"</p> 
               <p>Such was the rhapsody of Charlie Lee, upon entering his sister's apartment one beautiful spring morning, about four years after the events which have been described in the preceding chapters. Elva Lee, of whom our readers have had but little previous acquaintance in these pages, was now an invalid. For several months she had been almost wholly confined to the house by that most dreadful of all diseases-Consumption. In her healthful days, Elva had been considered beautiful; but now, her dark eyes were so intensely brilliant, her complexion so transparent and alabaster-like, her cheeks so delicately tinged, though alas! not with the rose of heath; and her countenance so expressive of peace,<pb n=""/> resignation, and Christian hope, that all who looked upon her felt that she was a being of almost supernatural loveliness. While her form wasted gradually away under the hand of the Destroyer, it had laid its emaciating touch upon her face but lightly, and as if reluctant to despoil so much of rare and heavenly beauty. Her cough was not very troublesome at times, and even her own family were not fully aware of the rapid and insidious progress of disease upon her delicate frame. They had guarded her with tender care through the chilling blasts of winter, and had hoped, nay, allowed themselves to believe, that the mild breezes of spring and the genial warmth of early summer would revive her drooping energies and contribute to her permanent recovery. The spring had opened unusually early for a northern climate, and Elva had improved its warmest and clearest days, by taking short drives with her father or brother, or indulging herself in brief rambles about the garden or over the lawn surrounding her home; from all which she seemed to derive much benefit.</p> 
               <p>For a few days past the weather had not been sufficiently mild for Elva to venture out, and she had become unusually languid. This Charlie had attributed to her recent confinement within doors, and hence the joy with which he greeted his sister on this the first morning which would allow of a brief release from her sick chamber.</p> 
               <p>"I am sure, sister Elva, it cannot hurt you to go out for<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC5768-00000053"/> a little while on such a charming morning," continued her brother, affectionately; "I will bring you your shawl and bonnet if you will venture out with me for a short walk. It will do you good, Elva."</p> 
               <p>"The morning is indeed delightful," replied Elva. "I can see from my window that the clouds have disappeared, and the sunlight glistens upon the green leaves. I would gladly go with you Charlie, but I feel so languid that I fear I should hardly be equal to the exertion."</p> 
               <p>"But Elva, if you would only go out and breathe the pure, fresh air, it would invigorate you; it is because you have been shut up so closely for the past few days that you feel so drooping now. You can look out upon the blue sky, but you cannot hear the singing birds or `breathe the perfume of the meadow-flowers here, Elva."</p> 
               <p>"O yes, Charlie, I hear their carolling as they pass my window: only a few minutes ago, two perched upon neighboring boughs close by, and sang very sweetly to each other, and I listened and fancied that I could interpret every note. As for flowers-you do not see, brother, that I have been provided with them this morning;" and she pointed to a vase containing a beautiful bouquet of freshly-gathered spring flowers, intermingled with a few choice exotics.</p> 
               <p>"Ah! those are very pretty. I did not know that our garden contained so great a variety. Who collected and arranged them for you. Elva?"</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"They were sent me by Nettie Carrol, together with a nice mould of blanc-mange of her own making," answered Elva.</p> 
               <p>"What an invaluable girl that Nettie is!" said Charlie, speaking partly to himself.</p> 
               <p>"She is truly, to me;" returned the invalid. "The sick are often forgotten by their friends who revel in the full tide of health, but Nettie has never forgotten <emph>me;</emph> if she has not been able to come and see me herself, I have always received from her some kind message daily, or some little delicacy of which she knows that I am fond. Blanche Rathbone calls often to see me as you know, and sometimes Susan Champell; but the other girls hardly ever come. Perhaps though they do not forget me, but fear that I shall make them gloomy if they come."</p> 
               <p>"It makes <emph>me</emph> gloomy, dear Elva, to see you shut up here, day after day, and often looking so ill. How can you endure this dreadful confinement?"</p> 
               <p>"Because it is the Lord's will, my dear brother; and why should I, who am but a worm, rebel at any of His doings?"</p> 
               <p>"Don't talk so, dear Elva!" exclaimed Charlie, with difficulty suppressing the tears which the angelic look of his sister, even more than the words which she had uttered, called to his eyes; "don't talk so;-you speak as if you believed you were soon to die, but you cannot be so ill as you<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC5768-00000054"/> imagine. When you can go out more regularly you will rapidly recruit, and by another spring I trust be as well as ever."</p> 
               <p>Elva smiled sadly. "Do not deceive yourself, dear brother," she said; "I feel that when another spring shall come, the sun will shine, and the birds sing over my grave. I do not say this to distress you, my brother, but that you may be better prepared for what is probably near at hand."</p> 
               <p>"Oh! Elva-Elva! why will you speak thus? I cannot bear to hear you! you <emph>must</emph> be mistaken. Why should <emph>you</emph> die so young?"</p> 
               <p>"Ah! Charlie, that is what I frequently ask myself-what have I ever done that I should be removed to a heavenly world, before having more than tasted of the many sorrows of this life? We know that all must die; and if we are only prepared for the great hereafter, should we regard it a calamity to be early permitted to exchange the darkness of this earth for the unutterable joys of that world where there are no tears to wipe away?"</p> 
               <p>"I know that your home will be in heaven, when you are gone, Elva; but oh! we cannot spare you yet! no-no! we cannot. What should I do, if you were taken from me?" and the young man bowed his head, and wept.</p> 
               <p>"So live that we may meet again where there are no partings, my darling brother," replied Elva, placing her hand affectionately upon Charlie's arm. "But you wished me to<pb n=""/> walk?" she added, changing the subject. "I think I <emph>will</emph> venture to take a short ramble, as the day is so fine, and I feel somewhat stronger now."</p> 
               <p>"Do not go merely to gratify me," said her brother; "you are the best judge of your ability to undertake it. I only urged it for the reason that I thought it would benefit you."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Lee at that moment entered the room.</p> 
               <p>"Elva, do you feel equal to the effort of a little ride?" she asked. "Your father has just returned from his country visits, and says the air is so very pleasant that if you feel sufficiently well Charlie had better take you out for a short drive while the horse is in harness. What do you say, my dear?"</p> 
               <p>"A ride would be very agreeable I think," she replied; "more pleasant than a walk, Charlie. Yes, mother, we will go."</p> 
               <p>And after a few moments preparation, she was comfortably seated by the side of her brother in the neat little carriage which was standing at the door.</p> 
               <p>"I believe I do feel better for coming out," said Elva, when after driving a half hour her brother had turned the horse's head towards home. "Suppose, Charlie, we call upon Nettie this morning? I have not been at her house since last fall, and it seems such a long time to me."</p> 
               <p>"Certainly, Elva, if you wish it, and think it will not<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC5768-00000055"/> excite you too much. Nettie sees us," he added, as they drove up to the gate before Mr. Carrol's residence, and stopping the horse he prepared to assist his sister in alighting from the carriage.</p> 
               <p>A graceful young lady had observed them for an instant from the front door, and was now hurrying down the long gravelled walk to meet them.</p> 
               <p>"Is it possible? Can this be you, Elva? What an unexpected pleasure! I am so rejoiced to see you here once more, my dear Elva," she exclaimed, clasping the lovely invalid in her arms. "Lean on me, too," she said a moment after, as Elva accepted her brother's proffered aid. "We must not let you fatigue yourself after your ride by walking all the way to the house without abundant support;" and she drew the unappropriated arm within her own as she spoke.</p> 
               <p>Elva was soon comfortably seated in a large, well-cushioned arm-chair, and looking, as Charlie asserted, less fatigued than when they left home.</p> 
               <p>"How natural everything appears here," said Elva, as soon as she had had time to look about her; "how happy I am to be able to get here again."</p> 
               <p>"I wish, my dear, you would remain with us to-day," said Mrs. Carrol; "it would afford Nettie and I a great deal of pleasure, and we would take most excellent care of you: do you not think you can oblige us so much, Elva?"</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>Elva shook her head. "Hardly," she replied, "for we did not expect to call anywhere when we left home,-besides, the weather may change by afternoon; and, you know, I am become as delicate as an exotic. I trust, however," she continued, "to give myself the happiness of a longer visit with you before a great while, if the weather should continue favorable."</p> 
               <p>"O Nettie, I have some news for you!" exclaimed Charlie, suddenly; "and for you also, sister,-for I remember I did not tell you this morning, as I intended. Can you guess it?-something that will please you both."</p> 
               <p>"I am sure <emph>I</emph> cannot imagine!" said Nettie, laughing; "there are so many things that it would afford me pleasure to hear, that it would puzzle me quite to try a conjecture."</p> 
               <p>"Well, Elva, what do <emph>you</emph> say?"</p> 
               <p>"I cannot guess at all. Come Charlie, do tell us-quickly; don't you see you are keeping Nettie in suspense?" said Elva, with a quiet smile.</p> 
               <p>"Yes-tell us!" added Nettie.</p> 
               <p>"Well then," said Charlie, "our old friend and teacher, Dr. Milford, is coming back to Elville to reside among us, and will probably be here in a few days."</p> 
               <p>"Good news, indeed!" returned Nettie, with animation; "I shall be right glad to see him back again. But what is the cause of his return? I thought he intended remaining in the little village where he commenced practice."</p> 
               <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC5768-00000056"/> 
               <p>"He never expected to make that a permament location," replied Charlie; "for he was not pleased with the place, and it presented few inducements in the way of his profession. But he had not thought of coming to Elville until he received a letter from father, written a week or two ago, offering him a business partnership. Father's professional calls are too numerous for his faithful attention, and are still extending, while his own health is not sufficient to undergo the exertion which they impose, and which he feels due to the responsibility of his position; he therefore thought it best to propose this arrangement, as one likely to be of mutual advantage. This morning, just as father was about starting on his round of visits, a letter was handed him which proved to be from Dr. Milford, and signified his acceptance of the proposition."</p> 
               <p>"Elva, you say nothing-" he continued, turning towards his sister but no; sooner had his eyes turned upon her, than with a bound and a half-suppressed cry he sprang to her side.</p> 
               <p>"She is fainting!" exclaimed Mrs. Carrol, quickly perceiving the cause of Charlie Lee's alarm, and in a moment she was supporting the drooped head of the invalid, and bathing her blanched face with clear cold water, which was fortunately at hand in a vase upon the table. Nettie hastened to an adjoining room, from which she quickly returned with a bottle of spirits. The color gradually came again to<pb n=""/> the hueless lips-the closed eyelids slowly opened, and Elva looked vacantly around her.</p> 
               <p>"Where am I? What are you doing? What is the matter with me?" were the first exclamations she uttered, as if striving to recal some indistinct vision.</p> 
               <p>"You are with your friends, dear Elva," said Nettie.</p> 
               <p>"And have been a little faint, and we are trying to make you better," added Mrs. Carrol.</p> 
               <p>"You have exerted yourself much beyond your strength, my dear sister," said Charlie. "I ought to have known that you could not endure the excitement of a call, in addition to your ride."</p> 
               <p>"I shall be better soon, Charlie," returned Elva, now fully herself again, "much better. I was a little confused just now, but shall shortly be well enough to go home with you. I don't know but I can now," she continued, endeavoring to rise from the sofa on which she had been placed; "father and mother will be uneasy about us, if we are not at home soon."</p> 
               <p>"You <emph>cannot</emph> leave now, my child," said Mrs. Carrol. "I shall not consent to your going from here until you are much better than at present."</p> 
               <p>"No, Elva-it will not do for you to attempt the ride yet," said Charlie. "I will go home immediately, and return for you again in an hour or two. In the meantime, you had better keep as quiet as you can, and endeavor to get some rest."</p> 
               <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC5768-00000057"/> 
               <p>Elva was better when her brother returned for her, but the weather had changed somewhat for the worse: the mild breeze of the morning had become stronger, and was growing damp and chilly; and the sky was now flecked with ashy clouds. Still the change was too inconsiderable to be noted by persons in full health; and the distance between Mr. Carrol's and Dr. Lee's residence was so trifling, that neither Mrs. Carrol nor Nettie thought of urging Elva to remain; especially, as she insisted that she was quite able now to bear the ride, and appeared really anxious to return home. It was also early spring, and the weather might get cold and rainy, and perhaps continue to storm for several days together. These reasons checked the hospitalities of Mrs. Carrol, but she was careful to supply the invalid with extra shawls, and to see her closely wrapped before leaving the house; and also, to warn her against much conversation while in the open air. These things arranged to her satisfaction, Mrs. Carrol entertained no fear of her young friend's experiencing any ill effects from her brief exposure. But notwithstanding, and in spite of all these precautions, Elva took a violent cold which fearfully increased her cough, and for many days confined her entirely to her bed.</p>

               <p>"HOW provoked I am!" exclaimed Ellen Trenton, in the presence of her mother, one morning about a week after Elva Lee's call at the Carrols. "How provoked I am!" and the young lady flung a prettily written note upon the floor, and stamped it with her foot.</p> 
               <p>"What is the matter now, Ellen?" asked the mother in her usual tone, such an exhibition of passion on the part of her daughter being by no means so uncommon as to excite a great degree of surprise or alarm. "Another 'regret' I suppose," she continued, "but who is it from that it should vex you so much?"</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Vex,</emph> mother! I'm clear <emph>mad!</emph> only hear this!" and she took up the crumpled note from the floor, and in a sneering voice read its contents aloud.</p> 
               <p>"'Miss Carrol regrets that she must decline Mrs. Trenton's polite invitation for this evening, and hopes the dangerous<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC5768-00000058"/> ous illness of a dear friend will be considered a sufficient apology for her non-attendance.'"</p> 
               <p>"A sufficient apology, indeed!" said Ellen, with unabated wrath, as she finished, again tossing the billet upon the carpet. "I wonder what relation the Lees are to <emph>her,</emph> that she must needs concern herself in all their affairs. Now this makes the third 'regret' that we've had this morning on that Elva Lee's account; a body would think she was a very princess born, from the great commotion that's made because she happens to be a little out of health. I don't believe she's half as sick as she pretends to be, either; for she looks as well as you or I. Only a few days ago I saw her riding out with her brother, and she was appearing as fresh and rosy as any lady in town; and I thought to myself then, that if she was really as sick as she pretended, she must put on the paint a good deal thicker than you or I ever ventured to do yet."</p> 
               <p>Ellen stopped to take breath.</p> 
               <p>"I don't think she looks sick at all," said Mrs. Trenton, taking up the thread of her daughter's discourse, "though to be sure I heard yesterday that she took a dreadful cold the last time she rode out, and that her friends were very much alarmed about her; but, then, they are pretty easily frightened, I guess; Doctors' families always are if anything happens to ail any of <emph>them!</emph> I dare say <emph>she</emph> has a cold, but, then, people that house themselves up for every little finger-ache, as she has done, must expect to take cold when they do go out.<pb n=""/> As for her color, I guess it's natural enough, for I've no doubt but what her mother would rather see her in her grave-clothes twice over, than with a speck of rouge on her cheeks. Why it's only a short time ago, that she had the impudence to tell me to my face, that she considered <emph>painting</emph>-that's just what she called it, she had no more refinement-'a positive VICE,' (only think of that), 'to which no lady of true breeding or even of correct principles, could become addicted.' These were her very words, and they prove that she's just what I always took her to be, a bigoted, narrow-minded, superstitious woman!"</p> 
               <p>"What <emph>did</emph> you say, mother?"</p> 
               <p>"O, I knew just what she was driving at, all the time," answered Mrs. Trenton, "but I determined not to gratify her by letting her see it; so I pretended not to take at all, but fell in with pretty much all she said. I drew on an awful long face, but that wasn't very hard work, for I was so provoked that I could do it easily enough; well, I drew on a long face, as I said, and told her that I too thought the practice not only indelicate but perfectly abominable, and I was surprised that any person of taste or gentility could engage in anything so degrading. She didn't make much that time, I reckon. I wish you could have seen the queer look she gave me, when I stopped speaking. I had hard work to keep from laughing, it was so mystified like. She looked as if she didn't know what on earth to think of it, as if she was<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC5768-00000059"/> amazed to hear me talk so-perplexed to know what it all meant, and at last rather pleased as if to say, 'well, after all, maybe the stories are not true.' Of course, no one <emph>knows</emph> that we rouge, for nobody, I guess, ever saw us put it on; and I don't think many would dare take oath that they could see it on our faces; it's something to know <emph>how</emph> to rouge nicely. There are not many that understand it. Most people that use it, lay it on in such a manner that everybody knows just what it is-now that I do think right down vulgar; but <emph>we</emph> know <emph>how</emph> to use it, and as I just said, no person out of the family can tell for certain that ours is not the natural complexion; it can only be suspicion on their part at the most.</p> 
               <p>"You say this is the third 'regret' we've had on Elva Lee's account," continued Mrs. Trenton, after gathering her resources by a short pause, "pray who besides her brother, and Nettie Carrol, have excused themselves for such a reason?"</p> 
               <p>"Why, Dr. Milford, mother-how forgetful you are!" answered Ellen pettishly; "I suppose he thought he <emph>must</emph> decline, because he happens to board at the Lees; I don't care a bit about <emph>his</emph> not coming, on my own account, but I know a great many will be disappointed not to see him here."</p> 
               <p>"Why should they?" said the mother; "he's nobody but a poor school-teacher, that old Dr. Lee has contrived to raise out of the dirt and put on a pair of stilts."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"But he's a bachelor, mother, with a handsome face and figure, a genteel profession, and a prospect of doing a good, money-making business. Of course, he'll be very popular in the village, and will be invited everywhere; so I thought I'd rather he would make his first appearance in society after his return, at our house, for I prefer leading in such matters to following other people; but, as he don't choose to come, he can stay away, that's all! and it's little <emph>I</emph> care."</p> 
               <p>Another brief pause and Ellen resumed:</p> 
               <p>"I do feel provoked, though, to think that Nettie Carrol should make such a fool of herself; I was anxious to have her present, she's such a help to one in entertaining company. I can't say I ever liked her much myself, but she's popular with a good many: I suppose it's because she's so chatty, and makes believe to be so great friends with people she talks with; and when a dull spell comes on, she happens to say something or other to make the company all lively again; and then she's always ready to play or sing when she is wanted to. Oh dear! I don't know what we shall do without her; I'm afraid it will be dull, and dull parties, of all things, I abominate."</p> 
               <p>"Pity we had our party now," said Mrs. Trenton seriously; "you know I thought we had better wait a little."</p> 
               <p>"What would we have gained if we had, I should like to know?" returned the daughter. "How was I to know that Nettie Carrol would take it into her head to stay away, just<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC5768-00000060"/> because Elva Lee had got a cold? I wish now, older married people had been invited to fill up, instead of our confining ourselves to the young married folk, and single ladies and gentlemen. If we had only done that now, we should have had a house-full, even if a good many did excuse themselves, but it's too late for that," and Ellen sighed at the prospect.</p> 
               <p>"Blanche Rathbone and Kate Belton haven't sent any excuses, have they?" asked Mrs. Trenton; "you know they are both considered tolerable good company, and so is Sue Champell. Sue can make herself very agreeable, when she has a mind to, you know, and she has promised to be here."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Susan will be here without doubt," replied Ellen, "and so will Bella Crawford and her sister, who has only just come out, and wouldn't miss a party for anything; but then she is such an affected piece, and takes so many airs upon herself, just because she has been away from home a few months at a boarding-school, to 'finish off,' as she calls it, that she is really almost unendurable."</p> 
               <p>"And Bella," suggested Mrs. Trenton.</p> 
               <p>"As for Bella, or <emph>Ara</emph>bella, as she insists on being called," continued the daughter, "she is so full of her novels, and thinks herself so very handsome and interesting, that she isn't very good company for anybody that has a fair allowance of common sense; but then she and her sister both dress well, and will do to count, and they may amuse some of the visitors by their performances."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Then Kate Belton and Blanche Rathbone?"</p> 
               <p>"Kate is witty, and so smooth to everybody's face, that <emph>she</emph> would be a great assistance if it wasn't that she's always so anxious to engross all the attentions of the gentlemen; and she shows it so plainly as to make herself positively ridiculous and disagreeable at a party. If I was only certain Blanche Rathbone would come, I should feel pretty easy, for it is never dull where <emph>she</emph> is. That's all, though, that can be said in her favor, for she's as conceited as the day is long, and as independent as if she were an heiress sure enough. I hope she'll come though, but I shouldn't at all wonder if she doesn't; for she is so led around by Nettie Carrol, that as like as any way she'll take it into <emph>her</emph> head to stay at home for somebody's toothache, just to please her."</p> 
               <p>"Well, the three Edgeway girls will be here without doubt," said the mother, "and that will make three more."</p> 
               <p>"O yes, they will be here, all pinked up to the eyes; but with all their silks and satins, the beaux won't be attracted or pay them any attention; so I expect <emph>I</emph> shall have them tied to me the greater part of the time, unless somebody has pity on me, and lends a helping hand."</p> 
               <p>"Then there are the Misses Remans, they will all be here."</p> 
               <p>"Suppose they are, what can they do but simper, and try to look pretty, and say 'yeth and no,' with a lithp."</p> 
               <p>"Well, there is that old maid, Miss Travers."</p> 
               <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC5768-00000061"/> 
               <p>"I guess she will come, for she's fond of company, but she won't be taken much notice of because she <emph>is</emph> an old maid. If they did but know it though, she is a great deal more agreeable to talk to than all the young girls put together. I don't like the idea though, of being obliged to entertain her to-night, and I hope she won't come; but if she does, you must try, mother, and set her to talking with some of the old bachelors, or if you can't make that out, with some of the married people, then she will do well enough. I positively cannot look after her and the Edgeway girls too, <emph>this</emph> evening. The gentlemen, I presume, will pretty much all come, and-there goes that bell again! I wonder whose 'regrets' have come now?"</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps no one's," suggested Mrs. Trenton; "it may be only the man with the fruit we ordered."</p> 
               <p>In a few moments a domestic entered the room, bearing in her hands a large bouquet of flowers.</p> 
               <p>"Oh! how beautiful!" exclaimed mother and daughter, simultaneously, "who sent them Betty?" asked Ellen, as she took them from the girl's hand.</p> 
               <p>"I doesn't know, Miss, but here am the letther was fetched with 'em," replied the girl, handing her a billet.</p> 
               <p>Ellen broke the seal, and glanced over the note.</p> 
               <p>"Miss Travers sends her compliments, and begs of us to accept of these flowers, as a slight token of regard," said Ellen, as she refolded the note. "Just the thing, arn't they,<pb n=""/> mother? they'll do nicely to fill the vases on our parlor mantel, won't they?"</p> 
               <p>"Just the thing," repeated Mrs. Trenton in response, examining the flowers; "look Ellen, they are almost all exotics."</p> 
               <p>"What a good creature that Miss Travers is," said Ellen, "I hope she <emph>will</emph> come, after all."</p> 
               <p>"I guess everything will pass off well enough," returned her mother; "we have had only six or eight excuses yet, and that's but a trifle, considering that we gave out eighty invitations."</p> 
               <p>"We can't expect every one can come," answered her daughter, who was now becoming quite good humored over the flowers which she and her mother had begun to arrange in the vases.</p> 
               <p>"We can't <emph>expect</emph> it," she repeated; "and as for the 'regrets' we have received, there are not more than two or three out of the whole that <emph>I regret</emph> receiving at all; indeed there is only one that I care much about."</p> 
               <p>"I shouldn't care for that one either, if I were you," said Mrs. Trenton; "Nettie Carrol isn't very genteel, or any great things any way. If it wasn't for their property, and a sort of standing they obtained when the place was small, they wouldn't be considered much of anything now. To be sure their house is furnished very well, but what does that amount to, when its mistress and her only grown-up daughter dress<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC5768-00000062"/> so plainly, and spend so much of their time in the kitchen with their servants, and as hard at work as any hired girl. Nettie makes nothing of clapping her hands into dishwater, <emph>you</emph> know; or of going around a good part of the morning with an old-fashioned check apron on; indeed I believe she takes especial pride in letting it be known that they are not above such work. They are vulgar, both of them-I mean <emph>all</emph> of them, for they are all pretty much alike."</p> 
               <p>"I know that Nettie is proud of such things," said the daughter; "for about a month ago-it was on the afternoon I visited at Edgeways-I noticed that Nettie had on a new dress that fitted beautifully. Well, you know how we have been bothered to get a dress-maker this spring that was worth a cent; so I thought I would ask her who she got to make her dresses,-so said I,</p> 
               <p>"'Nettie, who in the world do you get to make your dresses? They all fit you splendidly.'</p> 
               <p>"'Oh!' said she to me, putting on one of her comical looks, 'it's the same young woman that has made my dresses for a year or two back. She does a great deal of sewing in our family, and we like her first rate.'</p> 
               <p>"'Why, who is she?' said I, 'and where does she live? Mother would like to engage her to come and make dresses for her and myself.'</p> 
               <p>"'Well,' said she, and she looked around so as to attract all the attention she could, 'I suppose I must answer your<pb n=""/> questions in order. In the first place, she is a respectable young woman who has taught herself all she knows of the art. In the second place, she makes it home at our house; and in the third place, we pay her no particular price, but board her, and get her whatever she wishes to wear, and she does what sewing we wish her to. I hardly think you can induce her to go to your house to make dresses, as she has never done sewing for anybody but our family yet; I suppose she would though, if it ever should become necessary.'</p> 
               <p>"'Well you <emph>are</emph> in luck,' said I; 'I never knew before that you had a seamstress boarding with you; but after all, I should think it would be inconvenient and disagreeable to have her around all the time, particularly if she tries to make herself one of the family, as a girl hired in that way would be apt to do.'</p> 
               <p>"'O, <emph>we</emph> don't mind her being around at all,' answered Nettie, with another of her smart looks; 'we want her to feel at home, and consider herself one of the family; and besides, we never think of dress-making as being a discreditable occupation. She is really quite a nice girl, Ellen.'</p> 
               <p>"'Have I ever seen her?' said I. 'What's her name?'</p> 
               <p>"'Yes-you have seen her many a time;' she replied to me. 'Her name is Nettie Carrol!'"</p> 
               <p>"And then she looked around and laughed, as if she thought she had said something terribly smart. I laughed<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC5768-00000063"/> it off, out of politeness, of course; but I thought to myself I would have been ashamed to have told of it if I made my own dresses, and was general family seamstress besides."</p> 
               <p>"O, I always knew there wasn't a bit of <emph>true</emph> gentility about them," said Mrs. Trenton, after hearing this little sketch of Nettie Carrol, as painted by her daughter; "although it is pretended that Mrs. Carrol comes from one of the best and most aristocratic families in the State-but I don't believe a word of it. I-"</p> 
               <p>"Ding, ding-ding!" exclaimed Ellen impatiently, as the sharp tones of the bell again rung in their ears, "how many more times is that bell going to be pulled this morning I should like to know. Another 'regret,' I'll warrant!" and so it proved-for Betty soon appeared with two little billets in her hand.</p> 
               <p>"Put them on the table, Betty," said the young lady, sharply, "and don't show your ugly face in here again this morning if you can help it."</p> 
               <p>"It's never a bit I'd come <unclear>where</unclear> 
                  <emph>ye</emph> are, if I could git clear of it, Miss!" retorted the girl, angrily. "If ye 're so hard to plase, ye can be getting a woman to sarve ye that's more agra'ble in ye'r eyes," and she bounced out of the room, and closed the door after her with a slam.</p> 
               <p>"There now, you've got her Irish up sweetly!" said Mrs. Trenton, when the girl was out of hearing; "I don't see why you wanted to speak to her in that way; she wasn't to blame<pb n=""/> for coming in. I shouldn't wonder now if she was to be sulky and obstinate all day, and perhaps take it into her head to leave, just because she knows we need her so much just now."</p> 
               <p>"I don't care if she does," returned the daughter, warmly. "She's a saucy, hateful thing, and I'd as quick she would go as not: but there's no danger I guess, for she knows very well that good places are not so common as to be met with every day."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I hope she won't go," said Mrs. Trenton; "for she is my principal dependence in the kitchen, and good servants are not to be picked up every day, either. But who are those billets from?"</p> 
               <p>Ellen had just broken the seal of one, and first glancing over its contents, answered her mother: "This is from the Wheelers. I will read it."</p> 
               <p>"'Mr. and Mrs. Wheeler regret that on account of the indisposition of Mrs. Wheeler, they will be obliged to deny themselves the pleasure of visiting with Mrs. Trenton this evening.'"</p> 
               <p>"Well, we didn't expect them-so <emph>that</emph> is no disappointment," said Mrs. Trenton. "Come, let us hear the other."</p> 
               <p>"Just as I expected!" exclaimed Ellen, hastily running her eye over the second billet, "it's from Blanche Rathbone: just listen to this:" and she read aloud as follows:</p> 
               <p>"'Miss Rathbone begs that Mrs. Trenton will kindly excuse<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC5768-00000064"/> cuse her absence from her residence this evening, as she had engaged to pass the night with a sick friend, previous to receiving Mrs. Trenton's polite invitation.'"</p> 
               <p>"This is all Nettie Carrol's work," said Ellen, indignantly; "but I'll remember her for it, and Blanche too: by-the-bye, Blanche is a little indebted to me for one favor, and she may receive another perhaps equally agreeable if she don't mind. I presume this 'sick friend' is no other than Elva Lee: I do wonder how many she needs to take care of her. For my part, I wish she was-" Ellen dared not give utterance to the word which probably first rose to her lips, and after a brief pause she added-"well, or less trouble-some."</p> 
               <p>"I presume we shall have a very pleasant party without her, or Nettie either," said her mother; "and if we <emph>can,</emph> so much the better; at all events, I wouldn't worry about it, for it will make you look anxious and disturbed, and you know nothing is so ungenteel."</p> 
               <p>"Mrs. Trenton, will you please to step into the kitchen a moment?" asked a servant, who had been engaged for the day, entering the room where mother and daughter were busily employed in making sundry preparations for the evening's entertainment, an hour or two after the conversation we have described had taken place.</p> 
               <p>"They are having dreadful times there, ma'am!" continued the man, in a tone which instantly secured Mrs.<pb n=""/> Trenton's attention; "the cook has dropped the big plum cake, ma'am, and it's broke all to smash; and Betty, ma'am, has let the '<emph>blaw mong</emph>' burn. She says she couldn't 'tend door and 'blaw mong' too-and she won't neither; and she's got her things on, and says she wouldn't stay another minute for love nor money; and then the boy what was got to 'tend the ice-cream, has let the salt get in it; and I don't know what all, ma'am, or what's to be done."</p> 
               <p>"Mur-der-ation!" screamed Mrs. Trenton, and mother and daughter rushed instantly to the kitchen.</p> 
               <p>"There, all was confusion and uproar. Betty was standing in the midst, shawled and bonnetted, holding a large bundle of clothing in one hand, and gesticulating in a very energetic manner with the other. Her face, redder than usual, was swollen with anger; and she was recounting to her auditory, at the moment of Mrs. Trenton's appearance, the various wrongs and abuses which she had suffered either in fancy or reality while under Mrs. Trenton's roof; and was endeavoring to persuade her companions to follow her example, and quit the premises forthwith. The cook, with rueful countenance, was striving to collect the fragments of rich fruit-cake that were scattered about the floor; and the boy who had spoiled the ice-cream, was crying aloud in the corner; while the odor of burnt blanc-mange, filled the apartment almost to suffocation.</p> 
               <p>Such was the situation of things in Mrs. Trenton's kitchen,<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC5768-00000065"/> that instant action became necessary. That lady saw at a glance, that if she would retain a servant in her household, it would not do to give way to resentment; besides, she belonged to that class of individuals whose anger is in reality less excited by great, than by small provocations. In the present instance, her first emotion was one of consternation, for the day was far spent, and she could see no way of extricating herself from the difficulties by which she was thus suddenly surrounded. She felt that it was no time for the indulgence of useless lamentations, but that immediate action would alone quell the rising storm. After a momentary struggle, she so far controlled her feelings as to be able to speak with calmness, by the time her appearance had been discovered by the servants, when the tumult had partially subsided. Before venturing to address her servants, however, Mrs. Trenton turned to her daughter, who was standing near her, pale and speechless, and said to her in a low voice:</p> 
               <p>"Do not say one word, my dear, not <emph>one</emph> word, or we shall be ruined. Go into the back parlor, and see if these horrid fumes have reached there; better raise the windows anyhow. I will manage here for the present."</p> 
               <p>"What is the matter?" she said, addressing the cook. "A sad accident indeed, I should think. How did it happen?"</p> 
               <p>The cook, and indeed all the servants, were thunderstruck<pb n=""/> at the mildness of Mrs. Trenton's manner. They had expected to be assailed with a flood of violent abuse, commensurate in some degree with the magnitude of the present offences, having previously had some experience of that lady's mode of dealing on minor occasions, when things went wrong. Being therefore totally unprepared for the new manner of procedure upon which she had decided, their tactics were utterly at fault, and Mrs. Trenton held the vantage ground. The cook first broke the silence in reply to her interrogatory.</p> 
               <p>"Indeed, ma'am," said she, "I'm the most unluckyest woman alive. I thought the last coat of icing that I put on that are dumb cake last night, didn't look quite slick enough, so I, thinking I'd smooth it over a little with a wet knife this morning, brought it in here. After I'd done it, I takes up the plate that had the cake on, and turns it round and round, so as to see it was all nice, and all to once something hit my arm behind me, and down went the cake <emph>ca-smash.</emph> I couldn't ha' helped it to save me, but I wouldn't 'a had it happen for a hundred dollars, indeed I wouldn't. I'm willing to pay for the cake, ma'am, but that wouldn't mend it any now," and the woman raised her apron to her face, and began to cry.</p> 
               <p>"It was entirely accidental, I presume," replied Mrs. Trenton; "but I'm very sorry it happened. That cake cost a deal of money, Ruth, but it will do no good to talk or cry about it now; some of the largest pieces will do by cutting off<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC5768-00000066"/> the broken ends a little, and as we have a good deal of other cake, I guess we must try and get along."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Trenton having by these remarks pacified the cook, next turned her attention to Betty, who had remained silent, but was still standing with her bundle in hand, ready for a start. Mrs. Trenton had overheard enough of Betty's harangue to her fellow-servants, while approaching the kitchen, to be fully aware of their import, and the girl's present intention; but she thought it prudent to appear wholly ignorant upon the subject, and acted accordingly.</p> 
               <p>"Betty," said she, in a mild tone, "I see you have been getting ready to go out; must you go to-day? There is so much to be done that I really don't know how to spare you, for you are my 'right hand man,' when I get into a difficulty. You can go out to-morrow, if you like, and be absent longer than I could possibly spare you to-day.</p> 
               <p>"I see you are going to take home your winter clothes," she continued, without pausing for a reply, "but if I were you, I'd keep them here a little longer, for we may have a good deal of cold weather yet; you know it isn't one swallow makes a summer."</p> 
               <p>"It's for good I was going, ma'am," began Betty, in a half subdued tone, "it's-"</p> 
               <p>"O, I've no doubt of <emph>that</emph> at all, Betty," interrupted Mrs. Trenton; "I presume you were going out for some good; I should be sorry to think otherwise, for I hardly ever knew<pb n=""/> you to act from a bad motive. I presume you thought you could be spared a little while this afternoon as well as not, and so you could if it hadn't been for this sad accident."</p> 
               <p>"But it's for to <emph>stay,</emph> ma'am, I was going!" persisted Betty.</p> 
               <p>"Ah! going out to take tea with a friend?" and Mrs. Trenton's voice became slightly reproachful as she added, "you ought to have told me before, Betty, that you wanted to make a visit to-day, that I might have made it convenient; but as it is, I don't think it hardly fair for you to go, especially while we are in this fix, and expecting a whole houseful of company this evening. I guess you had better take off your things, and defer your visit until another day."</p> 
               <p>"It's no visit at all I was after making, Mrs. Trenton," returned the girl, bursting into tears, but evidently much mollified by the conciliatory language of her mistress. "I was belaving niver to come back to this house again, Mrs. Trenton. I be a rispectable girl, and it isn't to be trated like a baste that I can bear, Mrs. Trenton; and Miss Ellen, she never spakes a civil word to a body, but is always trating me like a dumb cratur, when it's after doing my best to plaze her that I am, Mrs. Trenton; and it's no dacent girl that'll stand it, Mrs. Trenton; I wish I was back in the ould counthry, it's nothing but throuble I've had since I come to Ameriky, Mrs. Trenton," and Betty having relieved her heart by this outburst, sunk into a chair and sobbed aloud.</p> 
               <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC5768-00000067"/> 
               <p>"O fie, fie! Betty," said Mrs. Trenton, going up to the excited girl, and placing her hand upon her shoulder, "you should never mind Ellen, she wasn't vexed with <emph>you</emph> at all, when you came in with the billets, but a note she had just been reading made her angry; she would have spoken just as cross to anybody else that had happened in while her fit was on. She was sorry she spoke so short to you as soon as you had left the room, for she told me so, and said she knew you weren't to blame; so never mind that, Betty, but be a good girl, and take off your things, and try your hand at a little more blanc-mange, or else make a boiled custard. We can cool either in Mrs. Rumley's ice-house; there'll be time enough if you only hurry, I guess. I bought you a beautiful new neck ribbon this morning, and I should be sorry not to see you wear it this evening."</p> 
               <p>"If I can only plase ye, Mrs. Trenton, it's all that I am wanting," said the girl, taking off her things, and wiping her eyes with the corner of her shawl; "but I couldn't help that blank mangys burning, and 'tend door all at once."</p> 
               <p>"No, of course not," returned Mrs. Trenton; "you had to 'tend door, and of course couldn't be in two places at once. If the bell rings again while you are busy, some one else must answer it."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Trenton next proceeded to the cellar to examine the condition of her ice-cream, which she found to be hopelessly spoiled. She had no more cream or milk to spare, and<pb n=""/> if she had even, it was almost too late to make the attempt with all the other work at present on her hands.</p> 
               <p>"What <emph>can</emph> we do?" said she to Ellen, after returning to the sitting-room, and relating to her daughter the course things were taking in the kitchen, and the ruin of the ice-cream. "It is impossible for us to make another cream to-day, and we must find something for a substitute. I wish that plaguey torment of a boy had been further,-but there's no time to be lost in fretting about that: we must decide upon something to take its place immediately."</p> 
               <p>"It's a wonder to me how you <emph>could</emph> keep your hands off the little scamp, mother," returned Ellen; "it's well for him he hadn't me to deal with, for I'd have made his ears ring nicely for one while, I reckon."</p> 
               <p>"I felt enough like doing it," said the mother, "but I was afraid of raising a tempest in the kitchen; and as I could not hope to be able to still another storm right away, I thought it politic to keep cool."</p> 
               <p>"I dare say your course was the wisest one mother, all things considered, but the way things have gone to-day is enough to try a saint; it's <emph>too</emph> bad, I declare. I can't bear to give up the ice-cream, but I suppose we've got to now. O, I could break the little rascal's head with a good heart-it's so provoking to have things turn out in this way, when we had calculated so much on having our party go a little ahead of anything of the kind we've had in Elville lately. I had<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC5768-00000068"/> set my heart on showing the Elville people a thing or two, but now I'm clear disheartened-everything goes wrong, and I'm sure I don't know what we <emph>are</emph> to do!"</p> 
               <p>"How would a boiled custard, covered with a whip of eggs, answer?" inquired Mrs. Trenton.</p> 
               <p>"Not at all!" answered Ellen, "its too awful old-fashioned. A snow-cream, or a whip syllabub I suppose would do very well to eat with the sweetmeats and jellies-but where is the <emph>cream</emph> to come from to make it, I should like to know?"</p> 
               <p>"I guess we can get a little from Mrs. Remens, and perhaps a little more of Mrs. Edgeway-at least enough between the two to make out. I'll go myself immediately and engage some somewhere, if it is to be had, and as we have some nice 'Charlotte Russe' and beautiful fruit, I guess we shall make out very well. I must buy a ribbon too, for Betty," continued Mrs. Trenton, "while I am out, for I told her I had a nice one for her, and she'll be expecting it."</p>

               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the unpleasant occurrences of the day, everything was arranged for the party before nightfall, and at an early hour Mr. Trenton, wife and daughter, repaired to their respective apartments to make their toilets for the evening.</p> 
               <p>"I declare I felt blue about this party one spell to-day," said Mr. Trenton to his wife, while adjusting the folds of an elegant cravat before the mirror.</p> 
               <p>"How so, my dear?" inquired Mrs. Trenton.</p> 
               <p>"Why this-you and Ellen didn't see fit to invite some people here to-night that I am owing money to," returned her husband, "and they have been down on me to-day 'like a thousand of brick;' it was dun-dun-dun-all the morning. Then, some little bills that were due to-day were sent<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC5768-00000069"/> in, but I couldn't meet them of course, so I promised to pay them to-morrow morning without fail. How on earth I was to do it, was more than I could tell; as old Treadly, who promised to lend me a hundred dollars this morning, suddenly found out that he couldn't spare me a cent. Some of these 'dunners' went away quite dissatisfied, and muttered as they left something about giving parties at other people's expense."</p> 
               <p>"How scandalous!" exclaimed Mrs. Trenton; "it is really astonishing to see how audacious and impudent some folks get to be. I wish you had paid up the small bills though, my dear; for it's so very annoying to have such people telling over town that we couldn't pay such little sums."</p> 
               <p>"And I should be glad to have you inform me where the money to pay them with is to come from, Mrs. Trenton! Perhaps with your superior wisdom you will be able to tell," answered her husband sharply.</p> 
               <p>"That fifty dollars which you borrowed only a few days ago, can't be all gone yet," said Mrs. Trenton. "Why didn't you take some of that?"</p> 
               <p>"Take some of that!" repeated her husband; "<emph>that</emph> shows how much you women know about business matters. You expect a fifty to last forever, and be spending from it all the time. What's to prevent its being all gone?"</p> 
               <p>"I'm sure <emph>I</emph> don't know what has become of it all, Mr. Trenton-perhaps <emph>you</emph> can tell?"</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"I suppose I <emph>can,</emph> madam," returned the gentleman. "You traded fifteen dollars with a pedlar the other day, didn't you?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes!"</p> 
               <p>"Well, I traded five dollars more with him, making twenty; this new cravat, vest and white kids cost ten more, all of which you said I <emph>must</emph> have, and thought I bought very low; we purchased a ring yesterday for Ellen's birthday present, which cost us five dollars; then that confounded fruit-cake that was broken to pieces I had to give a V for, because the baker refused to wait for his pay on account of some money which he pretended he was obliged to raise that very day: how much does that make, madam?"</p> 
               <p>"Forty dollars!" responded Mrs. Trenton, who had been performing a mental addition as her husband recounted the list of purchases.</p> 
               <p>"Which leaves ten dollars, precisely. Four of that," continued Mr. Trenton, "I paid to the butcher on an old account, and the balance has gone for butter and eggs for this party; butter you know is so scarce now, that it brings a great price."</p> 
               <p>"You couldn't have paid six dollars for what butter and eggs have come into this house within a week, if they <emph>are</emph> high," answered Mrs. Trenton. "You must have overlooked something. Didn't you buy some cigars? I heard you say the other day, you were nearly out."</p> 
               <pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC5768-00000070"/> 
               <p>"Yes, I believe I did buy a few. I had forgotten all about it though. That certainly took all that was left. Are you satisfied now, madam?" said Mr. Trenton, concluding his mathematical calculation with some abruptness of manner.</p> 
               <p>"Certainly, my dear; I don't see how we could have done with a cent less; but what are you going to do for money tomorrow?"</p> 
               <p>"I will tell you how that is managed, my dear," replied the husband more mildly; "I was walking down the street early this afternoon, out of spirits as well as out of cash, when I accidentally stumbled upon a couple of New York chaps, acquaintances of mine, who arrived in town last night, and are intending to spend a few months here to look after some speculation in which they are interested. I knew that one of them always had plenty of ready money, and I made myself very polite and agreeable; and, as they are fashionable, genteel looking fellows, I invited them to the party this evening, and assured them of a cordial welcome from yourself and Ellen."</p> 
               <p>"Will they come?" inquired Mrs. Trenton.</p> 
               <p>"They agreed to be here," responded the husband, in continuation, "and we then parted; but I didn't lose sight of them. I kept 'an eye on them,' as the saying goes, and just before coming home to-night, I called on them at their hotel. I mentioned that you desired me to drop in and say, that you would be much disappointed if they should<pb n=""/> not join the little gathering we were to have this evening; that you hoped they would not fail to come, for you were anxious to make the acquaintance of the friends of whom you had heard your husband so often speak. Remember <emph>that</emph> to-night love, 'the friends of whom I often have spoken.' I invited Mr. Beesley to walk a little way down the street with me, and I pointed out our house to him, that he might find it readily in the evening. While we were thus alone together, I 'beat around the bush,' until I got him to offer me the loan of two or three hundred dollars, which I made at first a show of declining, but afterwards consented to accept of a hundred and fifty to oblige him, and am to have it in the morning, tomorrow. With this, I shall return the fifty, pay off these little debts, and have some money left.</p> 
               <p>"How long can you keep this money?" asked Mrs. Trenton.</p> 
               <p>"For three months, at least," answered her husband, "and by that time I hope we shall have enough coming in from the rent of the old house and the little legacy your aunt left you, to pay it up. Then, I suppose I shall have to look around and borrow more somewhere, for my profession will not half support us in the style that people of our standing are expected to maintain. I am tired to death of borrowing in this way; it will wear my life out, unless we can soon get Ellen well married, and reduce our expenses, when I trust my business and our income from rent and the legacy<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC5768-00000071"/> acy will furnish us a comfortable support. I hope, my dear," he continued, "that you won't forget to mention to Mr. Beesley, in particular, that I have often spoken of <emph>him</emph> as a dear friend. I have known him these six years, and have met with him frequently during that time, though I may not have mentioned him to you, for we were not in the least intimate, and in fact I never liked him much. But I think it will be for our interest to make a good deal of him now; you will not forget this, will you, my dear?"</p> 
               <p>"O I'll be sure and remember," responded Mrs. Trenton, "never fear me. I know what is what, as well as the next person. What is the other gentleman's name?"</p> 
               <p>"Sandford," replied Mr. Trenton, "his name is Sandford. He is a regular scamp, I expect, but that is nothing uncommon now-a-days, the majority of young men are about as bad; so that won't hurt him so much as if he stood alone. He is fine looking, dresses fashionably, and when he chooses, can appear quite the polished gentleman; so he will take with a good many of the girls, I presume. How do I look, my dear?"</p> 
               <p>Mr. Trenton had now completed the arrangement of his dress to his satisfaction, and as he uttered the last sentence, he stepped a little forward, to enable Mrs. Trenton to judge the better whether he was <foreign xml:lang="FRA">au fait</foreign> in his personal appearance.</p> 
               <p>"Very well, indeed-first rate!" answered Mrs. Trenton, after a careful survey. "Now, how do <emph>I</emph> look?"</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Admirably!"</p> 
               <p>"Isn't my color too high?"</p> 
               <p>"Not a whit. You always hit it just right. I declare, you look almost as young as you did when I first married you, and a great deal prettier."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Trenton interpreted the compliment in an uncharitable sense, and her anger was enkindled at the equivocal reflection which she conceived lurked beneath.</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Trenton what do you mean by saying such a thing as that, when you know it to be false, perfectly well," responded the lady with much spirit. "It is not saying much for my past looks, to throw up to me that I am looking younger or better now than I did twenty-two years ago. I know you don't think so!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I do think so, 'pon my word, Mrs. Trenton! Your false teeth make a vast improvement in your appearance; as for rouge, you use it with more skill than you used to before we were married."</p> 
               <p>"I didn't use rouge at all, before we were married, Mr. Trenton," responded his wife energetically.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, you did-lots of it."</p> 
               <p>"I say I didn't, sir!" answered Mrs. Trenton, with increasing warmth, for she was getting more angry.</p> 
               <p>"Well, <emph>I</emph> say you did, and you know it too, madam; so you needn't deny it any longer," returned the husband with equal sharpness.</p> 
               <pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC5768-00000072"/> 
               <p>"Mr. Trenton, you are a disgrace to your species! You know you have been telling an outrageous, abominable falsehood! I needn't deny it, indeed! I <emph>will</emph> deny it, while I have the breath of life in me. <emph>You</emph> needn't say anything about false teeth. My good looks aren't half as much owing to them as yours are to your wig. Bless us, what a pretty figure you <emph>would</emph> cut without it, with your bare, bald pate shining like a ball of soap in a shop window, and a few gray hairs stringing down towards the neck like a row of bristles planted in drills! I'd laugh to see you going into company without your wig!" and with this severe retaliation, Mrs. Trenton subsided into an affected laugh.</p> 
               <p>"You perfectly outrageous woman! What do you mean by speaking in this manner to <emph>me!</emph>" demanded the husband furiously. "I'll let you know, madam, that I will not put up with such language from you. You know extremely well, that my hair is scarcely gray a whit!"</p> 
               <p>"If it isn't, it ought to be by this time, I should think," returned the lady drily. "You was ra-ther old when I married you, and you are nearly twenty-two years older <emph>now.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Mrs. Trenton, let me tell you once for all, I <emph>will not</emph> submit to such language from <emph>you!</emph> You are my wife, madam, and it is your duty to listen in silence to whatever I think proper to <emph>say.</emph> I am your husband-your lawful lord and master, whom you are enjoined to obey, and whose commands you are to fulfil, whatever they may be!"</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Obey <emph>you,</emph> you insulting wretch!" retorted his wife, measuring her husband from head to foot with her eyes as she spoke, and curling her lips contemptuously. "I'll <emph>never</emph> do it! I'll obey nobody's commands while I live. Lord and master, indeed! Yes, I know you've tried to be, more than once, sir; but you never made it out yet, sir, and you never will. I'll die first!"</p> 
               <p>Ellen entered the room at that moment, elegantly dressed.</p> 
               <p>"Oh! Pa, how well you do look!" she exclaimed as she entered; "Mother, you are looking beautifully! Why I shall be real proud of you both. There goes the bell! we must hurry into the parlor. I wonder who has come so early."</p> 
               <p>Her parents being now ready, and all the traces of the recent storm having disappeared from their features, adjourned into the parlor with Ellen, in order to be in readiness to receive their guests.</p> 
               <p>By nine o'clock, the rooms were well filled with company. Mr. and Mrs. Trenton were very polite to their guests, and exceedingly so to each other. Ellen was everything that was graceful, amiable and lady-like. The strangers from the city had arrived, and been presented to Mrs. Trenton and daughter, by the happy husband and father, and had received from Mrs. Trenton assurances of her exceeding happiness in making their acquaintance, with the further expression, that as the friends of her husband, of whom she had heard him make frequent and complimentary mention, she could not regard<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC5768-00000073"/> gard them as strangers. The gentlemen were evidently pleased with their flattering reception, and politely expressed their grateful sense of her kindness in affording them so early an opportunity of making the acquaintance of her family, and so many of the young people of Elville.</p> 
               <p>The guests of the Trentons on this occasion were, many of them, expensively, and some even elegantly attired, and a few of the ladies displayed more than their usual share of beauty. The company were sociable, if not gay, and things were passing off much better than Ellen had dared to expect. She was really thankful for the unlooked-for addition which the party had received in the persons of the strangers, who seemed to enter into the spirit of the entertainment with much zest, and thus afforded her material assistance, in enlivening the dulness which at first threatened to control the evening. They engrossed the most dashing young ladies of the company from an early hour, and the young gentlemen of the village were obliged to bestow their attentions upon the less obtrusive, and <emph>perhaps,</emph> less attractive fair ones who adorned the seats by the wall, so that <emph>they</emph> were <emph>not</emph> neglected, and Ellen was spared the task of exerting herself in their behalf.</p> 
               <p>Conspicuous above all others at the entertainment, were the Misses Crawford and Miss Kate Belton, and probably each of these young ladies voted herself the belle of the evening. Bella and Flotilla were looking their handsomest,<pb n=""/> -and they would have been called handsome anywhere-of which fact they were evidently fully sensible; and Kate, although less brilliant, was at least pretty, and looking her best. As neither of the trio were afflicted with an excess of bashfulness, and as they were all ready and anxious to take part in a polka or a waltz, at the first summons, and thoroughly understood the tactics necessary to secure the requisite attention from the sterner sex; and as an appearance of homage was indispensable to their enjoyment of a party, whether obtained by stratagem or force, it would be singular if they did not figure more prominently in society than their companions whose modesty or good sense rendered them more retiring. The fashionable air and manners of the gentlemen from the city, had at once attracted the three young ladies, and called forth their most delicate arts in the effort to make an agreeable impression upon the fascinating strangers. The gentlemen, in their turn, appeared highly pleased with the charming freedom of their fair companions, and freely expressed their admiration by the exclusiveness of their attentions. They did not, however, forget to honor Miss Trenton with an occasional notice, in deference to her parents, whose guests they were; and indeed, were once diverted, soon after their arrival, into asking an introduction to Miss Susan Champell, whose pleasant countenance and rich dress seemed to awaken their attention, aided a little, perhaps, by Mr. Trenton's whispered information that she was a rich man's<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC5768-00000074"/> daughter. But Miss Champell was rather reserved and distant to strangers of whose previous history she knew nothing, and not being in the present instance particularly pleased with the foppish appearance of the fashionable gentlemen, she treated them with more than ordinary coolness, and was so unsocial that they soon left her to pay their <foreign xml:lang="FRA">devoirs</foreign> to the volatile circle in which they were better appreciated.</p> 
               <p>After supper came waltzing, when Miss Belton and Bella Crawford had the honor of being swung around the room by the gentlemen from the city; and soon after, Flotilla was distinguished by being chosen as Mr. Sandford's partner in a polka.</p> 
               <p>"What do you think of Elville, Mr. Beesley?" inquired Bella, as, after the waltz was over, herself and partner rested upon an unoccupied divan. "Do you not think it a romantic and beautiful place?"</p> 
               <p>"Very!" returned the gentleman. "I think its scenery very fine, and (bowing) its ladies very beautiful! Are you fond of romantic scenery, Miss Crawford?"</p> 
               <p>"O, <emph>very!</emph>" returned Bella. "I dote on romance! Are you fond of reading, Mr. Beesley?"</p> 
               <p>"Rather," replied that gentleman.</p> 
               <p>"Then of course you have read Maria Reginald Roche's works-how do you like them?"</p> 
               <p>"I believe-that is, I don't remember much about them, Miss Crawford," replied Mr. Beesley, hesitatingly.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Can it be possible you have never read 'The Children of the Abbey?' exclaimed the young lady, with a look of surprise; "but of course you have not," she continued, without awaiting an answer, "or you never could forget it. O, it's such a delightful book, Mr. Beesley-you <emph>must</emph> read it! You will be charmed with it, I know. I protest, I almost envy you the treat you have in store. I could hardly sleep at night after it was begun, until I had finished the whole three volumes. Amanda was such a beautiful character, and so was Lord Mortimer, and Sir Charles Bingley too-which of the three did you like best? Oh! I forgot that you have not read it yet, but I wish you had, I declare, for I want to know what you think of it. You've certainly read 'Alonzo and Melissa?'"</p> 
               <p>"No-positively, I don't think I have, and yet it seems familiar; I must have read it-a long time ago, though."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, you must have read it, for it's quite an old work, I believe. What an awful book it is," continued Bella, "it's enough to make one's hair 'stand on end' with fright, to read it. I liked it, for all, didn't you?"</p> 
               <p>"If I remember right, I believe I did. Have you ever perused Walter Scott's novels, Miss Crawford?"</p> 
               <p>"No, sir, none but 'Ivanhoe,' and most of that was so dreadful dull, that I didn't read any more of his stories. Did you like them?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, yes; I thought them very instructive as well as<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC5768-00000075"/> entertaining. I thought 'Rebecca' a very interesting character."</p> 
               <p>"O, I liked 'Rebecca' very well too, but I don't fancy some of the other characters at all. And I don't like to read about houses without carpets on the floors, it is so common and ungenteel." Bella did not notice the queer expression on Mr. Beesley's features, at this peculiar criticism, and continued her remarks: "I don't see, either, what he gave his heroine such an awful homely name for; I think Rebecca is a horrid name-I'd as quick had it Leah, and done with it. Have you ever read the 'Mysteries of Udolpho,' Mr. Beesley?"</p> 
               <p>"I have heard of the book," replied Mr. Beesley, rather amused at the direction of Miss Bella's literary tastes, "but have never read it. I have lately perused a very pleasant little story, called 'The Twin Sisters,' and another, not very recent publication however, entitled 'Dunallan.' Have you met with them Miss Crawford, in the course of your reading?"</p> 
               <p>"I've read 'Dunallan' once, or rather part of it-for I skipped a good deal," answered Bella; "it's tolerable-but it isn't the kind of work I fancy much. I'm trying some of Bulwer's novels now, and I like <emph>them</emph> first-rate. I delight in Bulwer-don't you, Mr. Beesley?"</p> 
               <p>"To tell you the truth, I know very little of his works from personal examination," answered the gentleman. "I<pb n=""/> read very few works of fiction; I haven't time, without neglecting my newspapers, or other reading of a more substantial nature; but there is Mr. Sanford now, who has been through every novel you can think of. I think you will be pleased with him."</p> 
               <p>"I like his <emph>looks</emph> wonderfully," said Bella, "he has the air of a hero, quite; and if he is fond of reading, and romantic too, I know I shall like him. What a beautiful dancer he is, isn't he? How well he and sister Flotilla went through that polka!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, admirably. What did you call your sister's name?"</p> 
               <p>"Flotilla! Isn't it pretty? Mother found it in a book. You see it's a <emph>novel</emph> name, and I think it's a little prettier than mine."</p> 
               <p>"Your name is Bella, is it not? I think I heard you called Bella, by some of the ladies; a pretty name-it has quite a musical ring upon one's ear."</p> 
               <p>"O no, sir! my name is <emph>Ara</emph>bella Lucine-but father and mother always called me Bell or Bella when I was a child, because it came so much handier; and now most of the girls affect to believe that Bella is my real name, and that I have no other. It really provokes me sometimes."</p> 
               <p>"I declare! the ladies are going to the dressing room already!" added Bella-by which name we shall continue to<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC5768-00000076"/> call her, it being her true one; "I had no idea it was time to break up yet!" and she hastened from her seat.</p> 
               <p>"A little past twelve, I believe," said Mr. Beesley, after taking a sly peep at his watch. "Shall I have the pleasure of attending you safely home, Miss Crawford?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly-if you please," was the prompt response; and, having exchanged the usual courtesies with Mr. Trenton, wife and daughter, she repaired to the dressing-room, and soon after departed homewards under the special guardianship of Mr. Beesley.</p>

               <p>SWEET Elva Lee! how meekly she bore her illness. No matter how excruciating the anguish which racked her slender frame, no word of murmur or complaint escaped her lips: no impatient look revealed for a moment upon her lovely features a rebel thought within.</p> 
               <p>A week had now elapsed since her call at the Carrols', and from that time her sufferings had been so intense, and her symptoms so alarming, as to fill the hearts of the most hopeful of her friends with fearful forebodings, and to awaken in them apprehensions of her speedy dissolution.</p> 
               <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC5768-00000077"/> 
               <p>It was evening. Nettie Carrol and Blanche, who were to watch for the night by the bedside of their former playmate and companion, had arrived; and her parents, with her brother and Doctor Milford, had bade Elva "good night" and retired from her apartment, leaving the watchers alone with their charge. Elva had been suffering much less than usual during the afternoon and evening, and appeared so much easier, that her father thought it would be unnecessary for the young ladies to sit up the entire night; and Mrs. Lee suggested that they should in turn occupy a couch which had been placed in an adjoining room opening into her daughter's apartment, and endeavor each to secure as much repose as possible.</p> 
               <p>"Oh! how good is God to me!" exclaimed Elva, as, after the family had gone from the room, Nettie and Blanche seated themselves by her bed. "How can I be thankful enough for His kindness and love, in bestowing upon me such undeserved blessings and mercies! Others, better than I, and worthier, have been stretched upon beds of pain and death without a relative or friend to minister to their wants or to soften the bitter pangs of disease by their presence; but I-God has surrounded me graciously by the best of parents, the most devoted of brothers, and the kindest and most affectionate of friends, who never weary in attending to my slightest wants. I do feel thankful for all this in my inmost heart, but it sometimes saddens me to think that the<pb n=""/> only return I can hope to make for so much kindness is the thanks and the gratitude of a dying girl!"</p> 
               <p>"O do not speak thus, dear Elva; perhaps you will not-" Blanche could not add the word die, for her utterance was impeded, but recovering herself in a moment, she continued, "You are so much better to-day, I hope you will soon overcome the affects of that dreadful cold."</p> 
               <p>Elva shook her head. "No, Blanche," she said, "I shall never leave this room again, until I am taken from it to the grave; and if God so will, I would not wish it otherwise. I know that I am apparently better to-day, and possibly I may be spared a repetition of the bodily suffering which I have endured for a few days past; but I <emph>feel</emph> that I am soon, <emph>very</emph> soon to take a last look of the beautiful scenes of earth, and bid adieu to all the dear friends whom I love so well, and who have been so kind to me. It is hard to leave you all, my dear Nettie and Blanche,-but oh! I hope and pray that it may not be an eternal farewell-that we may meet again in a brighter, happier home than this, where there will be no more partings forever! And I pray that heaven may reward you for your kindness to me, and smile upon you always!"</p> 
               <p>"Have you no dread of death, dear Elva, that you can speak so calmly of its approach? has life for you no charms, that you are thus willing to give it up in your very spring-time?"</p> 
               <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC5768-00000078"/> 
               <p>"The world is very beautiful, beloved Blanche," returned the invalid, "and contains much that is lovely and attractive, as well as many friends who are unspeakably dear to me; my life has been one of great happiness, with but few sorrows or trials to chequer its brightness; still, dear Blanche, if it be the will of the Great Creator that I shall be separated from these pleasant scenes thus early, and taken to a sinless home in heaven, I feel that I can exclaim with my whole heart-'O God! thy will be done!'"</p> 
               <p>For a moment Elva paused, and Blanche did not interrupt the silence.</p> 
               <p>"It is true," resumed the invalid at length, "I sometimes shudder at the prospect of encountering the cold waters of death, and fear lest at the last trying hour my heavenly hope might fail me-but these dark clouds soon pass away. Faith grows brighter, and as I know that 'my Redeemer liveth,' I feel confident that He will sustain me. To Him I cling, upon Him I place my reliance alone, and supported by His arm I shall pass the dark portal; for me, Death will have no sting!"</p> 
               <p>How beautiful was the countenance of the invalid, as she uttered these words! how heavenly the smile that still lingered upon her lovely features after the sound of her gentle voice had died away! Both Blanche and Nettie were overcome, too much to attempt to speak, and Elva, apparently exhausted, closed her eyes as if to sleed.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>After a brief silence, Nettie urged her friend, in a soft whisper, to retire into the room which had been prepared for their comfort; promising to call her in case any serious change should take place in the symptoms of their patient, and also to exchange places with her towards the morning. Soon after Blanche had left the sick chamber in compliance with this arrangement, Elva unclosed her eyes, and motioned Nettie to her bedside; for the latter, supposing her to be asleep, had withdrawn to the other end of the room near the light, and taken up a book for the purpose of keeping herself awake, as well as whiling away the time until her charge should require her attendance. The summons was instantly obeyed, and Nettie bent down over the couch, to hear more distinctly the whisper of the invalid.</p> 
               <p>"Please to close the door, Nettie," said the latter, "I have something to say to you, and our voices might disturb Blanche."</p> 
               <p>"Are you not afraid it will weary you too much, to converse any more to-night?" asked Nettie, as, after carefully closing the door as requested, she seated herself upon the side of the bed, and laid one of the wasted hands of the sick girl within her own.</p> 
               <p>"I think not," replied Elva, "for I am feeling stronger than usual to-night. I have one or two requests to make of you, dear Nettie, and something impels me to make them now, for I may never again have the opportunity."</p> 
               <pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC5768-00000079"/> 
               <p>"Speak then, dear Elva."</p> 
               <p>"You remember the little cottage that stands about half way down the long road leading to the pond?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes!"</p> 
               <p>"Well, there is a poor woman living there, with three little children, the youngest of whom was named for me. Her husband died early last fall, since which time she has endeavored to support her family by washing and plain needle-work. She is young, and willing to work, but her health has been very poor since her husband's death, and she has been able to earn but little. I visited her often, and rendered her all the assistance in my power, until I was confined at home by this illness. She has been here this winter once or twice, but was looking very thin and pale, and said she was not able to accomplish much on account of her poor health. Mother then gave her provisions and clothing, for herself and little ones, and exacted from her a promise to come again, but she has never returned; and I am afraid she is too ill to go out, and is, perhaps, suffering for the necessaries of life. Will you call upon her Nettie, to-morrow if possible, for me, and will you befriend her when I am gone?"</p> 
               <p>"I will, most certainly, Elva-but why have you not mentioned her case to me before? I would gladly have joined you in contributing to her relief."</p> 
               <p>"I do not in the least doubt it," answered the invalid,<pb n=""/> "but I knew that you had so many ways for dispensing your charities, that I did not wish to trouble you with another; besides, mother and I have been able to do everything that has appeared necessary until now. Mother has become so much averse to going out latterly, that I do not like to tax her with so long a walk, or I would not have troubled you with this matter now; but if you find the widow in need, I am sure mother will be glad to co-operate with you in any effort to render her comfortable."</p> 
               <p>"I will call to-morrow, unless Providentially prevented," said Nettie, "and I will endeavor to supply your place as far as possible. Is there any other service I can render you, dear Elva, or anything else you wish to confide to me?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes!" replied Elva, in a still lower voice, almost sinking into a whisper. "Nettie, did you ever suspect me of having a secret sorrow?"</p> 
               <p>The cheek of the fair invalid became slightly flushed, as she asked this question. Nettie hesitated for a moment.</p> 
               <p>"I have always thought," she at length replied, "that within your heart all was peace and tranquillity; and yet, dear Elva, I have sometimes imagined that-that it might be possible you did not hope from the future for so much of happiness as the past had yielded; that life was not so full of sunshine for you, or existence so dear, as in former days. I have fancied that it was possible that-Elva dear,-I dare not tell you what I have thought."</p> 
               <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC5768-00000080"/> 
               <p>"Do not hesitate to speak fully-to tell me all you think," returned Elva, calmly; "I am too near the grave to feel pained by the knowledge that you, my dear friend, had previously fathomed my secret, if it is indeed so, even though I had thought it hidden from every mortal eye."</p> 
               <p>"I have discovered nothing, dear Elva," exclaimed Nettie, quickly, "I have merely surmised,-conjectured-that-"</p> 
               <p>"That I have cherished in my secret heart a hopeless passion. Is not that what you would say, Nettie?"</p> 
               <p>"No-oh! no-not that exactly,-but lately-or within a week or so, I have fancied that Doctor Milford was something more to you than a <emph>common</emph> friend; that he held a dearer place in your affections than either Blanche or myself, or any others whom you honored with your friendship; and that, from some mysterious cause, the attachment was an unhappy one. Am I right, Elva?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Nettie," replied the invalid, "forgive me for saying it, you have conjectured aright, in every particular;" and Elva, relieved from the first embarrassment of breaking to her friend the delicate secret, now poured out her heart in full confidence. "Yes Nettie," she continued, "my regard for him has grown with my growth, until it has become too strong and absorbing to bear the name of friendship. I <emph>love him,</emph> Nettie-I have loved him long; but how could I help it, seeing him as I did day after day, and discovering in him all those virtues and manly qualities which I most admire in<pb n=""/> the other sex. From a child the tones of his voice have fallen upon my ear like the sound of music; and yet, I believe it was the pensive expression of his pale face, and his sweet, but sad smile, that first awakened the tender sympathy which afterward became an absorbing, undying affection. I was not aware of the strength or nature of this attachment until he left us for another home; then I felt, suddenly, how great was my dependence upon his presence for happiness. The future now seemed a dreary blank,-a cloud hung over me and covered me with darkness; and the sun whose rays had gilded my pathway, was shut out from my view, leaving a void that could never be filled. I struggled hard against these feelings, for I knew that they would destroy my future usefulness and peace if permitted to control me; and after a time I succeeded in partly subduing their intensity; but his image still clung to me, and I have never been able to banish it from my heart. There it has been cherished, there it will cling, until my spirit quits its frail home of clay.</p> 
               <p>"Dr. Milford," continued Elva, in the same gentle tone, "Dr. Milford treated me always with affectionate kindness; but his manner was such as an elder brother would naturally exhibit towards a young and favorite sister; and I, even after I had discovered the nature of my affection for him, never dreamed of demanding a greater return. He visited us occasionally, as you will remember, after he removed from Elville; during these visits, he treated me less as a child than<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC5768-00000081"/> formerly; he consulted my taste on many occasions, and conversed with me upon general topics, as he would have done with my father or my mother; but his bearing, though more deferential, and perhaps more gentle, towards me, was, so it seemed to me, less affectionate than before. I became so fearful then, lest he might, by some means, discover the interest which I felt in him, that my manners became constrained, and I could neither feel nor act with my former freedom in his presence. I do not know that he ever even suspected how dear he was to me, but the last time he came to Elville as a guest, he conversed much more than usual with me about himself; he spoke of single life, and its dreariness to one possessing his love of home and home pleasures; but he said, that he was unfortunately so circumstanced, that he could not change his condition, however much might be his desire to do so. He said he had spoken more freely to me of himself, than to any other person in Elville, but that he confided in me as in a very dear sister, who sympathized with him and would never abuse his confidence.</p> 
               <p>"O Nettie," continued the fair invalid, with deep emotion, "you cannot imagine how these words pierced my heart-how they wounded my pride. I think <emph>now</emph> that I may have been mistaken; but I believed <emph>then,</emph> that my heart had been unveiled before him, and that he had taken this method of assuring me of the utter hopelessness of my affection. I was deeply mortified, and almost angry; but I struggled hard to conceal<pb n=""/> my feelings, fearing that their betrayal would convince him that his suspicions were well founded. I assumed an air of indifference quite unnatural with me, for my pride rebelled at the idea of his thinking me so foolish as to cherish for any one an unsought affection. I do not know what evil genius possessed me, but on the morning of his departure, when he, half seriously, half playfully, begged one of my ringlets as a keepsake from his <emph>sister;</emph> I coldly, and I'm afraid haughtily, refused him. He seemed both surprised and grieved.</p> 
               <p>"'I beg your pardon, Miss Lee,' he remarked, 'I certainly did not mean to offend you," and in another moment he was gone.</p> 
               <p>"Nettie, I cannot express to you one half of the sorrow and bitterness that filled my heart, for many days after his departure. I then felt that in my pride I had deeply wounded one who had ever manifested for me the most delicate kindness and consideration, and who was at least entitled to my gratitude. I began to imagine that I had been too hasty in my conclusions upon his motives in speaking as he had done of himself; and I could not sufficiently blame myself for the hasty and foolish course I had pursued.</p> 
               <p>"Months passed away, and though Dr. Milford wrote frequently to my father and my brother, he said nothing of making us another visit, notwithstanding Charlie had, in his letters, repeatedly invited him to come. My health, you know, dear Nettie, has been failing since last fall. During the winter it<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC5768-00000082"/> declined so rapidly, that I did not think I could last long; but I could not bear the thought of leaving the world forever, without seeing him once more and obtaining his forgiveness; and yet I knew not how I should be able to explain my previous conduct towards him, without revealing to him the true state of my heart. This I could not summon resolution to do; still my anxiety to see him again increased, and I resolved, if Heaven granted me that privilege, that I would endeavor by my future bearing towards him, to convince him of my regret for the past.</p> 
               <p>"The winter at length departed, and I began to fear that I too should pass away, with my only remaining desire ungratified. Though it was not, I presume, intended to be kept secret, it so happened that I heard nothing of the arrangements that had been made for Doctor Milford's residence at Elville, or his expected coming, until Charlie mentioned it so suddenly at your house, although father had concluded the matter by correspondence with the Doctor, some time before. The surprise and excitement of this unlooked for announcement was, I suppose, too much for me; of its effects you were yourself a witness.</p> 
               <p>"Since Dr. Milford's return I have been too ill to converse much, until to-night. He has been frequently in my sick chamber, but I have never seen him alone, and as I shall probably be confined to this room for the remainder of my brief time here, I cannot expect a private interview with<pb n=""/> him, unless I should particularly request it. To do this might excite suspicions of the truth, in the minds of my parents and brother, and, for worlds, I would not have them grieved with the knowledge that their cherished Elva was bearing with her to the grave a wounded and bleeding heart. Ah! wholly <emph>broken</emph> it might have been, but for Him who poureth oil into the deepest wounds, and sustaineth all who look to Him for comfort and support, even in the darkest hours."</p> 
               <p>Elva had paused at frequent intervals during her narrative, to gather strength sufficient to continue it to the end, and now that it was completed, she sunk back from utter exhaustion. Nettie pressed a tender kiss upon her pale cheek, and wiped softly away the tears that were stealing from beneath her drooping eyelids.</p> 
               <p>"Do not attempt to talk any more to-night, dearest Elva," she said, in a trembling voice, for her own tears were falling rapidly, "it will weary you too much. Perhaps you will be better to-morrow-try now and get a little sleep." A tear dropped on Elva's hand as she ceased speaking.</p> 
               <p>"Do not weep for me, dear Nettie," said the invalid, opening her eyes and fixing them affectionately upon her companion, I am not unhappy <emph>now;</emph> I am perfectly resigned to the Past and to the Present, and look forward with joyful hope to the Future. I am going to the Great Physician, who is able to heal all our sicknesses, and Who alone can make the wounded spirit whole.</p> 
               <pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC5768-00000083"/> 
               <p>"There is but little more that I wished to say," she continued, after a short pause, which Nettie did not interrupt, "and I wish to say it before I attempt to sleep. Nettie, will you unloose my cap, and cut off one of my ringlets for me? They are sadly disarranged now, I presume, but you can soon smooth one of them, and make it look as well as ever-take the prettiest one, Nettie. There, now, if you please, just open the drawer to my dressing-table," she added, as Nettie, after complying with her request, re-adjusted her cap. "You will find a small shell box in it; you can arrange the ringlet in the box according to your own taste, and I wish you to take it home with you. When I am gone, give it to Dr. Milford, and ask him to accept it as a keepsake from his sister Elva! Tell him how she sorrowed for having once unkindly refused him so simple a gift; and that through you she asks his forgiveness for it. Will you promise to do this for me, Nettie?"</p> 
               <p>"I will, I will!-all that you have requested," answered Nettie, in a voice broken with emotion. The invalid gently pressed her hand.</p> 
               <p>"Dear Nettie, my last earthly care is now removed," she murmured, and in a few brief moments apparently subsided into sleep.</p>

               <p>NETTIE did not forget the promise she had made to her sick friend, that she would visit the poor widow. Early on the afternoon of the day subsequent to this promise, she set out for the cottage. As the distance was considerable, and the weather unusually fine, she concluded to invite Blanche to accompany her, and accordingly called in at Mrs. Belton's for the purpose. Not being considered a stranger, she was ushered at once into the family sitting-room, where she found Blanche at work embroidering a fine muslin collar, and looking very pale and dispirited. On the sofa reclined Mrs. Belton, with some knitting lying near her; while Kate occupied a large, well-cushioned arm chair, and was busily engaged in holding her hands together, and occasionally<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC5768-00000084"/> stroking with her foot a large Maltese cat that lay stretched out upon the rug before her.</p> 
               <p>"You have not taken a nap since you returned from Dr. Lee's this morning, I should judge;" said Nettie to Blanche, after the usual compliments were over. "You are looking pale, and almost sick."</p> 
               <p>"I do not feel very well-my head aches badly," returned Miss Rathbone.</p> 
               <p>"And embroidering muslin will not prove a sovereign panacea, I'm afraid," said Nettie.</p> 
               <p>"She said she slept a part of the night-and hasn't complained at all, before;" interrupted Mrs. Belton, not very good-humoredly. "Nobody knew till now that she had a headache. She looked dull enough to be sure, and lowspirited-but everybody looks dull after watching; and as for being out of spirits, she's always so when she has been at Dr. Lee's. As for that collar-mercy on us! she can let <emph>that</emph> alone if she chooses, and go to bed. I can do without it as well as I have done;" and Mrs. Belton took up her knitting and began to employ the needles very briskly.</p> 
               <p>"The collar is yours then, Mrs. Belton?" asked Nettie, rising to examine it; "it is very beautiful! quite a new pattern-is it not?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes! entirely new," said Kate, languidly; "that's the reason mother is in such a hurry for it; for there's to be a visit to-morrow evening, and she wants to wear it before it<pb n=""/> gets common. She's like me, mother is,-she can't bear a thing after it gets common, and every body gets to wearing it; <emph>that</emph> spoils it for her or me, right off."</p> 
               <p>"Can <emph>you</emph> do this stitch, Kate?" asked Miss Carrol with considerable emphasis.</p> 
               <p>"O yes! I understand the <emph>stitch</emph> well enough," replied Miss Belton, with a yawn; "but I don't like such work at all. It's too close for my eyes. I always detested every kind of embroidery; besides, mother prefers that Blanche should do such work when it is done in the house; and I'm sure <emph>I'm</emph> willing."</p> 
               <p>"Blanche is quicker with her needle than Kate," said Mrs. Belton; "and on fine work, a trifle neater I think. Kate never did like sewing of any kind; so she is not as much accustomed to it as her cousin."</p> 
               <p>"I suppose <emph>you like</emph> this work <emph>very</emph> much?" remarked Nettie ironically, turning to Blanche; "but if your head is aching badly, I would advise you to deny yourself the pleasure of working on it for a little while to come, and see what effect a little sleep would have upon you.</p> 
               <p>"I called," continued Nettie, "for the purpose of inviting you to go out with me this afternoon on an errand of usefulness; but I do not think the bright sunlight would be of any service to your head, so I shall not invite you."</p> 
               <p>"No-do not;" returned Blanche, looking up from her work with a faint smile; "do not!" she added, with a trace<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC5768-00000085"/> of feeling in her tone; "I <emph>like</emph> my work so much that I cannot possibly leave it this afternoon, unless I am obliged to do so. I <emph>would</emph> follow your advice, and court a little sleep-only I promised aunt last evening that her collar should be in readiness for the visit to-morrow evening, and I wish to fulfil my word."</p> 
               <p>"She always <emph>will</emph> watch whenever anybody takes it into their head they want her," said Mrs. Belton, "when she knows that if it don't happen to be convenient for her to sleep the next day, it will make her almost down sick. I never did believe in watching for everybody, and I told her so last night; to be sure though, one can't get out of it always,-and if any of us have to go, she is the best hand, for she sits up so late nights to scribble or read, that she wouldn't mind it as much as either Kate or I, who are used to more sleep. We can't either of us stand it to watch at all,-it makes us down sick."</p> 
               <p>"I declare we never <emph>can</emph> judge of a person's health or strength by their appearance," said Nettie with a peculiar smile, which, perhaps, Blanche was able to interpret. "Now almost any person would say, that you and your daughter were far healthier, and capable of much greater endurance than Blanche-but, as I said before, we can't judge by appearances. Were you at the party last night, Kate?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, indeed!" answered Miss Belton, galvanized by this question into considerable animation; "and a delightful time<pb n=""/> we had, too! You and Blanche, who were such fools as to send regrets, don't know what you missed. I wondered if you would go away without asking me about it."</p> 
               <p>"I certainly came very near doing so," returned Nettie, "for I had not thought of it before, to-day. Your speaking of being up nights, reminded me of it. Were there many at the party?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, quite a number," replied Kate, coloring slightly, but trying to look unconscious. "Everything passed off first rate. I haven't enjoyed myself so well, I don't know when, as I did last night."</p> 
               <p>"I expect Kate was one of the stars of the evening!" said Blanche, smiling.</p> 
               <p>"Star or no star," returned Kate briskly, "I guess a had as <emph>much</emph> attention as any young lady there, if not a <emph>little</emph> more There were a couple of strangers there, gentlemen from New-York city, and you can't begin to think how agreeable and polite they were. I understand they are going to spend several months in Elville, at the least; and that they are both very rich. Mr. Trenton knows them well; they are particular friends of his-at least one of them is. I suppose he has met them at the houses of his great relations in the city. I wish you had been there, Nettie, so that you could tell me which of them you thought the handsomest."</p> 
               <p>"Indeed!" said Nettie Carrol.</p> 
               <p>"Oh yes! Bella Crawford and I have had a great dispute<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC5768-00000086"/> pute about them this morning when we went to make our party call. She thinks Mr. Sanford is a great deal the best looking, but <emph>I</emph> say Mr. Beesley is far ahead of Mr. Sanford. Ellen Trenton is on my side, but Bella will have it that her favorite is not only the handsomest but the most intelligent and more like the 'gentlemen in novels!'"</p> 
               <p>"I shall have to keep a little watch over Kate," said Mrs. Belton, with a knowing smile, "for one of these gentlemen took it upon himself to wait upon her home last night."</p> 
               <p>"Ah! then I <emph>would</emph> advise you to keep a pretty sharp look out!" said Nettie, encouraging Mrs. Belton's humor; "was Susan Champell there, Kate?" she continued, turning to the daughter more seriously.</p> 
               <p>"Oh yes! Susan was there," answered Miss Belton, "but she was so jealous of the attention the Crawford girls and I received from the strangers, that she couldn't enjoy herself a bit. But don't, for mercy sake, mention that <emph>I</emph> said so though, for I wouldn't have her hear of it for the world; but it's true enough for all that; she was wonderfully dignified and cool to us, and yet she watched us pretty nearly the whole time, and anybody that looked at her could see she was out of spirits about something; <emph>we</emph> knew pretty well what that something was."</p> 
               <p>"And yet, it's hardly like Susan Champell to be jealous," said Nettie; "besides this, any lady as pretty and intelligent, and as agreeable as she is, to say nothing of her wealth,<pb n=""/> could hardly fail of receiving as much attention as she could desire."</p> 
               <p>"She didn't get much last night, at any rate, whether she wanted it or not," said Kate with spirit.</p> 
               <p>"Did Bella Crawford and her sister attract their share of admiration, or as much as you, Kate?" asked Blanche, a little maliciously.</p> 
               <p>"Well, I suppose they thought they did," returned Kate. "One thing is certain though, if they didn't, <emph>they</emph> were not to blame; for, if they <emph>are</emph> particular friends of mine, I must say, I never saw girls so forward in my life. That Flotilla is perfectly bold! nobody would dream she had only just 'come out.' I know Ellen Trenton was ashamed of her actions last night, for Ellen is a perfect lady, and such conduct couldn't help disgusting her. Are you going to call at the Trentons this afternoon, Nettie?"</p> 
               <p>"I intend calling soon," replied Miss Carrol, "but not to-day. I have a trust to perform for poor Elva, which will occupy the remainder of the afternoon. Really, I have been making quite a long visit here," she added, rising and moving towards the door; "I did not intend remaining longer than a few moments when I came in. Good afternoon."</p> 
               <p>A leisurely walk of half an hour, brought Nettie to the door of the little cottage, whither she had been directed by Elva Lee. Her knock for admission was instantly answered by a flaxen-headed little girl, who opened the door for her to<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC5768-00000087"/> enter. But suddenly discovering a stranger, she appeared disappointed and alarmed, and running to her mother exclaimed, "O it isn't Miss Lee, mamma! it isn't Miss Lee, at all."</p> 
               <p>"Please walk in, Miss, and be seated," said a pale, sickly looking woman, rising with much difficulty from an old armchair, and approaching the door. "My little girl is not much accustomed to seeing strangers here, and it has frightened her a little. Please excuse her, she is very timid."</p> 
               <p>"Certainly, do not apologize," replied Nettie, taking the chair which the widow had placed for her, "she thought me Miss Lee, did she not?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes," answered the widow; "she caught a glimpse of you as you passed the window, and said to me that Miss Lee was coming. Miss Lee has been very kind to us, and used to call here quite often to see us, but she has not been here for a long, long time now. I saw her twice last winter at her home. She was sick then, but said she hoped she would be able to come and see us again when the spring came; and so my dear little Mary has been looking for her almost every pleasant day since the winter has gone. She had a good kind heart, and I fear she is yet ill, for she has not come. Do you know Miss Lee?"</p> 
               <p>"Very well indeed," answered Nettie; "I came here at her request, this afternoon. She is very ill, far too ill to go out, but she remembers you, and has commissioned me to call<pb n=""/> in her stead, and learn how you are getting on, and to ascertain if you or your family need anything. She was fearful that you were not well, or that some of your family were ill, as she had seen nothing of you for a long time. And I think she said, when you were last at her father's, you promised soon to come again."</p> 
               <p>"She was quite correct," said the widow; "we have <emph>all</emph> been afflicted with sickness this winter, and I have been confined to the house almost ever since I saw her, with the rheumatism. All that I have been able to do to help myself with, has been a little sewing, and that has brought me so small a sum that we should have certainly suffered a great deal had not a kind Providence raised us up a friend. I do not know who that friend is; but some one has three times sent us wood this winter, and the last time it came the old man who brought it brought also a bag of potatoes, and a large sack of flour, which he said were sent by the same gentleman that furnished the wood. So we have not suffered very much yet. I could not persuade the old man to tell us the name of our benefactor, for he said he had orders not to reveal it.</p> 
               <p>"It pains me very much, Miss," continued the poor woman, "to be obliged to accept assistance in this way from strangers, for in my younger days I did not think it possible I ever could be reduced to my present situation. I had parents then, and an abundance of this world's goods; but<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC5768-00000088"/> alas! parents and fortune are long since gone; and, but for the generous kindness of the Lees, I fear I should have, long before this, been obliged to seek shelter for myself and dear little ones within the walls of the county poorhouse. I <emph>could</emph> have got along without, someway or another, if I had only had my health, for I would have worked my fingers to the bone rather than be driven to such an alternative from starvation; but it is a long time since I have seen a well day. Do you think Miss Lee will be long sick, Miss-I don't know what to call you?"</p> 
               <p>"Carrol," answered Nettie, "my name is Carrol. Miss Lee has long been and still continues very ill, and her friends do not think she will ever entirely recover, but they hope soon to see her improve considerably from her present condition."</p> 
               <p>"Poor dear young lady! I hope she is not so dangerously ill as you fear," said the widow, wiping away the tears from her eyes "Many a poor person would lose such a friend as is not often found in this world, should she be taken away-and she is so young too! Oh I hope you may be mistaken, Miss Carrol, and that it is not so."</p> 
               <p>Nettie shook her head. She felt no encouragement to hope.</p> 
               <p>"Oh! if she must die," continued the widow fervently, "may the Lord in Heaven reward her for all her kindness to me and my dear little ones!"</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>The babe which had been sleeping in the cradle, awoke at that moment, and began to moan piteously: the little girl who had opened the door for Nettie, endeavored to hush it, but in vain.</p> 
               <p>"Draw the cradle near to me, my dear," said the mother, "and I will take her. Poor little Elva! she has not been quite well to-day, I think," she continued, lifting the child from the cradle to her lap; "do you not think she looks feverish, Miss Carrol?-she does not usually have much color."</p> 
               <p>Nettie approached, and took one of the infant's tiny hands in hers; it was very hot-and its face was flushed with a tint rapidly deepening into crimson-its breath came short and quick; and upon taking its pulse, Nettie found that it was beating at a fearful rate.</p> 
               <p>"She has a high fever, ma'am," said Nettie; "something must be done for her immediately. Can you send for a physician?"</p> 
               <p>'I have no one to go but Mary," replied the mother, "and she is almost too young to send so far alone. She can do a great deal for a child of only six years, but I dare not trust her to go to the village by herself; besides-" she added hesitatingly, "my dear young lady, I have nothing to pay a physician for coming, and it would be wrong to trouble one to come, knowing that I could not pay him. I know Dr. Lee would come willingly, but he and his family have already done so much for me, that I can't bear to trouble<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC5768-00000089"/> him unless it is <emph>very</emph> necessary. Can I not do something for her myself?"</p> 
               <p>"We will do all we can," answered Nettie, "and when I return home, I will send a physician, and will engage to satisfy him for his visit. How have you been able to get along, and take care of your young children, during your sickness, Mrs. Merton?" she continued, laying aside her hat and shawl; "it seems to pain you to move <emph>now,</emph> I cannot understand how you managed when you were worse."</p> 
               <p>"I have a poor neighbor, Miss Carrol, who comes in and helps me when I am very bad," replied Mrs. Merton, "and then my little Mary and Edwin are both very good children; they have taken very good care of me, and the baby too. Last week when I was at the worst, my neighbor took litle Elva home with her almost every day, and kept her there for hours together. She and her children have been very good to me, and I hope I may live to repay them for their kindness."</p> 
               <p>While Mrs. Merton was speaking, Nettie was watching the countenance of the child and from its movements she imagined it was suffering pain in its throat. She immediately communicated her suspicions to the widow; and upon examination they discovered that its throat was much swollen, and the tonsils very badly inflamed. It instantly occurred to Nettie that she had recently heard Dr. Lee mention that the scarlet fever had made its appearance in<pb n=""/> Elville; and she thought the symptoms of the child corresponded generally with those pertaining to that dangerous disease She resolved, however, not to mention her fears to Mrs. Merton, lest she should, perhaps, alarm her unnecessarily; but to first do everything which her limited medical knowledgeindicated as proper; and then to hasten immediately for a physician. She knew that in cases of hard colds or fevers, bathing the feet in warm water often proved beneficial in the early stages: she, therefore, promptly applied the remedy to the little sufferer, after which she applied draughts; and then, as the cottage afforded nothing more suitable, she bound up the child's throat with raw cotton. The babe soon appeared more comfortable, and Nettie, after informing the widow that she would send a physician as soon as possible, and with a promise to repeat her visit upon the following day, arose to depart.</p> 
               <p>Nettie stopped a moment at the cottage door of the neighbor of whom Mrs. Merton had spoken, and slipping a piece of money into her hand, requested her to go over and render as much assistance as she could until she should see her again. This the woman readily promised, and Nettie walked rapidly onward without pausing or slackening her pace until she had reached the residence of Dr. Lee.</p> 
               <p>"How is Elva this evening?" she inquired of Mrs. Lee, who met her at the door, "I must see her a moment before going home."</p> 
               <pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC5768-00000090"/> 
               <p>"She is <emph>very</emph> much better, we think;" replied Mrs. Lee cheerfully. "She has more appetite, and really seems stronger and brighter to-day than for many days past. This afternoon she insisted upon having on her dressing gown, and has been sitting up some considerable. I removed her pillows to the sofa a few moments ago, and persuaded her to lie down on that for a little while, as she seemed so adverse to returning to her bed. You can go right in, my dear; she will be very glad to see you."</p> 
               <p>In the passage-way Nettie encountered Dr. Milford, who had just left the dining-room and was proceeding to his office which opened into the hall through a private door. She related to him briefly the circumstances under which she had left the widow and her babe, and requested that either himself or Dr. Lee would call at the cottage without delay. Dr. Milford replied that an engagement would prevent his leaving home for half an hour, after which he would go to Mrs. Merton's, as Dr. Lee had not yet returned from a professional visit into the country. This arrangement satisfied Nettie, and she immediately repaired to her friend's apartment.</p> 
               <p>Elva was lying on the sofa as she had expected when she entered,-but her eyes were closed, and she did not arouse from the noise of Nettie's entrance. Supposing she had fallen into a light slumber from which she would soon awake, Nettie seated herself upon a chair near the door, and watched the lovely features of the sleeper with deep interest.<pb n=""/> Her thin, white hands were folded sweetly upon her breast-a few glossy ringlets which had escaped from beneath her loosened cap rested upon and partly shaded her cheek, which, during the last few weeks, had been as colorless as snow; her lips were slightly parted, and around them seemed to linger a pleasant smile. The expression of suffering which had been more or less visible upon her features since her sickness, was now gone, and in its place all was serenity and peace.</p> 
               <p>"O how lovely!" murmured Nettie to herself as she gazed. "How sweetly and quietly she sleeps! I wonder she should so soon fall into so sound a slumber. How still she is! how <emph>very</emph> still-I wonder when she will awake!"</p> 
               <p>A strange and indistinct but undefinable fear began to creep over her.</p> 
               <p>"Elva!" she exclaimed, no longer able to control her alarm, "Elva!" But no answer came-not even the slightest motion disturbed the awful stillness of the sleeper.</p> 
               <p>Pale as ashes, Nettie staggered forth into the hall, where she met Dr. Milford again.</p> 
               <p>"O come with me!" she faintly articulated. "Come-Elva!"</p> 
               <p>Without asking a question, the physician immediately returned with her to Elva's room.</p> 
               <p>"Does she sleep?-does she sleep?" whispered Nettie. "She is <emph>so</emph> still-go-see-I dare not!"</p> 
               <pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC5768-00000091"/> 
               <p>Dr. Milford softly approached the sofa and bent over it for a moment, then dropping upon one knee he pressed a long kiss upon the pure brow of the lovely girl.</p> 
               <p>"Yes! she sleeps!" he exclaimed, rising and turning his agonized face to Nettie; "she sleeps-but she will never wake again! She is-dead!"</p> 
               <p>Sweet Elva Lee! thus, in the solitude of her quiet chamber had her gentle breath indeed passed away. Her innocent life was ended, and ere long the birds carolled sweetly above her resting-place; but her pure spirit-did it not enjoy the richer melodies of heaven?</p> 
               <p>We cannot describe the sudden anguish that overwhelmed the fond parents, when they became acquainted with the death of their beloved daughter; nor the wild, impassioned grief of the devoted brother; nor the deep, but more silent sorrow that filled the hearts of Nettie and Dr. Milford. Permit us, therefore, dear reader, to pass over in silence the mournful events of the few days subsequent to the death of Elva Lee. Those who have "drank deep of the waters of affliction," may easily realize in their own hearts how all-pervading the sense of this calamity overshadowed the hearts of the surviving relatives and friends.</p> 
               <p>Notwithstanding the excitement of this sad event, neither Nettie nor Dr. Milford forgot the poor widow and her sick child. They rendered every assistance that circumstances made necessary or useful, and under the judicious management<pb n=""/> ment of Dr. Milford, and the careful nursing of Nettie, the more violent symptoms of disease-which proved to be scarlet fever-abated, leaving the little sufferer in a fair way to recover.</p>

               <p>"DR. MILFORD is in the parlor, and wishes to see you my dear;" said Mrs. Carrol to Nettie one evening, a week after the death of Elva Lee. "He says that he has just returned from Mrs. Merton's, and that her babe has taken a hard cold, and is now worse than ever."</p> 
               <p>"Poor Mrs. Merton! how much she has suffered!" said Nettie.</p> 
               <p>"I am afraid the Doctor has come to ask you to go down there and watch to-night," continued Mrs. Carrol; "but if he should, I hope you will decline; for your health is not sufficient at present to admit of your taxing it as you have been doing for some time past: remember, my dear, that it is as imperative a duty to take suitable care of your own<pb n=""/> health, as it is to render assistance to others when deprived of it. You know you have been complaining for several days, and you are looking pale; I really think a very slight exposure now would prove too much for you."</p> 
               <p>"If Dr. Milford thought me ill, or looking pale even, he would not wish me to go down to the cottage; you may be sure of that, mother," returned Nettie; "and as I really feel that watching <emph>to-night</emph> would be anything but beneficial to me, I shall not insist upon attempting it. If necessary, I presume he could get Miss Travers to go; you know she is always ready for every 'good word and work.'"</p> 
               <p>"Mother tells me you have just left Mrs. Merton's cottage," said Nettie to Dr. Milford, after the usual compliments had been interchanged, "and that little Elva is again worse I was there only yesterday morning, and thought her nearly well."</p> 
               <p>"The child took a very hard cold yesterday, in some way," replied the Doctor, "and this morning when I called as usual, I found her in a raging fever, and the customary remedies seemed to have no effect in checking it for any length of time. This evening Dr. Lee accompanied me, and though the babe was somewhat easier than this morning, both of us agree in the opinion that there is very little hope of its recovery."</p> 
               <p>"Poor little creature!" said Nettie. "How does its poor mother bear this renewed affliction?"</p> 
               <pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC5768-00000093"/> 
               <p>"She is almost beside herself with grief," replied Dr. Milford, "and seems fully convinced that nothing can now save her child. She is very anxious to see you, and really appears to repose more confidence in you and your opinions, than in any other person. She certainly considers you a remarkable being Nettie, and I sometimes think she fancies you to possess powers to ward off almost every calamity. She begged of me to bring you to the cottage to-night, if it was only for a few moments, that you might see the child, and tell her what <emph>you</emph> think of its situation."</p> 
               <p>"Would that I could avert some of the afflictions which press so heavily upon her," responded Nettie, with much feeling; "but, Doctor, I am hardly equal to the walk to her cottage to-night."</p> 
               <p>"I did not encourage her to expect you," replied the physician, "for I knew that if you should go there, you would not be able to get away very soon, and I knew that you had already exerted yourself beyond your strength; but as she was very solicitous, I promised to call, and if you were well enough, to invite you to accompany me to her house. You are looking uncommonly pale this evening. I am afraid the excitement and fatigue of the last fortnight has made you ill. Are you feeling as well as usual, Miss Carroll?"</p> 
               <p>"I cannot say that I am," replied Nettie, "my head has troubled me a good deal for several days, and I feel a weariness and lassitude to which I have hitherto been a stranger;<pb n=""/> but I attribute it wholly to loss of sleep, and the grief which we have experienced in the death of our dear friend. Mother would not be willing to have me go to the cottage to-night," she continued, "and unless my presence there be absolutely necessary, I should feel it my duty to remain at home."</p> 
               <p>"Your assistance is not really needed," returned the Doctor, "for the neighbor whom we have so often met there has promised to remain during the the night, and Dr. Lee has engaged the services of a good nurse, whom he thinks he can persuade to enter upon her duties this evening. Still, if <emph>you</emph> were present, Mrs. Merton would be quite apt to think no one could do anything properly but yourself."</p> 
               <p>"Do you return again to-night, doctor?"</p> 
               <p>"I told her that if you were well, and could leave home, we should be there very soon; otherwise I should not call again until half-past nine or ten o'clock."</p> 
               <p>"It is hard to deny poor Mrs. Merton so slight a request," said Nettie musingly, "and if mother had not expressed herself so decidedly against it, I believe I should venture once more; for, after all, I am not really sick."</p> 
               <p>"It would not be prudent for you to do so, Nettie; a proper regard for yourself and friends requires that you should exercise more caution in avoiding exposure, than you have heretofore, perhaps, considered necessary. Exhausted as you are now, from recent care and anxiety, such caution is doubly necessary."</p> 
               <pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC5768-00000094"/> 
               <p>"I suppose you are correct, Doctor," said Nettie, smiling seriously, "at all events, I don't feel at liberty to scorn a physician's advice.</p> 
               <p>"How is Charlie?" she continued; "I have not seen him since dear Elva's funeral; is he any calmer or more resigned than then?"</p> 
               <p>"I can discover no perceptible difference in him," answered Dr. Milford; "a very little calmer he may be, but he still mourns unceasingly, and will not be comforted; he scarcely tastes his food, and shuts himself up in Elva's room for hours together; frequently he wanders off alone, avoiding all companionship, and seldom speaking to any one, unless directly addressed. His parents are becoming quite alarmed on his account, and we have been consulting upon the propriety of sending him abroad for a few months."</p> 
               <p>"He has not yet completed his studies, I believe."</p> 
               <p>"He has one year more to spend at College, but it would not be well for him to attempt study in his present state of mind; travelling would be much better, and our only fear is that we should find great difficulty in persuading him to undertake a journey, unless we can make it (ostensibly at least) a business one, of great importance. Poor fellow! he has lost a lovely sister, and Time, I fear, will be long in healing his heart-sickness."</p> 
               <p>"He has ever been a <emph>noble</emph> brother," said Nettie. "The world does not contain many such, Dr. Milford."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"I fear not," replied the Doctor. "This world is blessed with few such hearts as his. When you were both little children, and pupils of mine, you, Nettie, had more influence over him than any one else, and I have thought maybe if you would talk with him, and endeavor to divert his mind from this all-consuming sorrow, he might listen and yield to <emph>you,</emph> when he would not to another."</p> 
               <p>"I would gladly make the effort, if anything I could say would have influence; and I will, if I can obtain a proper opportunity; but alas! Doctor, I fear I should be but a weak comforter," returned Nettie, sadly. "Poor Charlie! he is not the only one who mourns his sister's early death,"</p> 
               <p>"No! he is not the <emph>only</emph> one," repeated Dr. Milford, with slight emphasis, "for who that ever knew her, but loved her in life, and mourned her in death."</p> 
               <p>"Miss Carrol," he continued, after a short pause, "I believe you were with <emph>her</emph> during the last night of her illness-did she speak much of her friends?"</p> 
               <p>"She spoke of <emph>you,</emph> Doctor. Miss Rathbone had retired into an adjoining room to seek a little sleep, and we were left alone together. Elva then gave me a message for you, and a little gift, both of which she enjoined me not to communicate or surrender until she should be in her grave. Since then, I have had no opportunity of seeing you alone, until to-night. I will fulfil her injunction now."</p> 
               <p>Nettie then left the room, and soon after returned, bringing<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC5768-00000095"/> ing with her the little box which Elva had intrusted to her care.</p> 
               <p>"She requested me to give you this," said Nettie to Dr. Milford, "and to ask you to accept it as a parting gift from your sister Elva."</p> 
               <p>The physician raised the lid, and in spite of every effort to suppress his emotion, his eyes filled with tears, when he beheld the soft, shining ringlet within. For several minutes he gazed upon it without attempting to speak.</p> 
               <p>"How beautiful!-how natural!-it is indeed a precious memorial!" he at length exclaimed, "and she wished you to give it to <emph>me,</emph> Nettie?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, and to say to you that she grieved for having once thoughtlessly refused you such a slight <foreign xml:lang="FRA">souvenir,</foreign> and that she hoped you would pardon her for the pain it caused you. She told me what induced her denial of the simple boon you asked of her; and I assure you in all sincerity, Doctor, it was provoked by no feeling of unkindness harbored in her bosom towards yourself. She spoke of you with gratitude and affection; and I am quite sure no other sentiment had a home in her heart, although she acknowledged, with sorrow, that on one occasion she had given you reason to think otherwise."</p> 
               <p>"Dear Elva!" said the Doctor, deeply moved, "she did indeed surprise and wound me on one occasion, both by her language and her manner; but I never allowed myself to<pb n=""/> believe that her singular demeanor was prompted by any evil motive. I supposed rather that I had in some manner, unconsciously given her, what she believed to be, just cause of offence. Nettie, you can solve the mystery-can you not also reveal it to me?"</p> 
               <p>"I can-but I do not know that it would be right, or well to speak further. Elva requested me to say what I have said; yet Doctor, I may perhaps venture to add, that in <emph>my</emph> opinion, it was a newly-awakened fear or suspicion on her part, that you imagined she cherished for you a warmer affection than you desired or could reciprocate, that occasioned her sudden coldness towards you; her pride instantly took the alarm, and-but I think she soon concluded that her fears were wholly groundless," added Nettie quickly, for she saw by the Doctor's countenance, that her revelations were distressing him exceedingly, "and she attributed blame to no one but herself."</p> 
               <p>"Nettie," said the physician rising, and again seating himself beside her on the sofa; "you certainly have strong reasons for believing all this, and though I would not for worlds, seek to wrest from your keeping the minutest portion of the confidence of the sainted being who has lately gone from us, that you believe <emph>she</emph> would wish concealed from me; yet your words have so pained and surprised me, that I must beg of you, if you can consistently do so, that you will answer a few inquiries which I feel constrained to make.<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC5768-00000096"/> Can you tell me what induced Elva to entertain suspicions of such a nature regarding me?"</p> 
               <p>"Indeed Doctor I cannot, without revealing more than under existing circumstances I consider justifiable: I regret deeply that I have been so unwise as to lead you into inquiries that I cannot feel myself at liberty to answer. You will <emph>please</emph> excuse me, Doctor?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly, Nettie-I presume you are right in refusing to answer me. I will derive what consolation I am able, from the knowledge that poor Elva did not long cherish such suspicions with regard to me. Nettie-"he continued, "I have had the great book of human nature open before me for five-and-thirty years, and for the last fifteen years of that period, I have been so situated as to be able to make it an almost constant study. I may not have been a very apt scholar,-still, I think that I have learned sufficiently to read the human face somewhat, and from it to judge a little of the workings of the heart. From her childhood, the sweet and innocent face of Elva Lee has been to me a delightful and interesting study. As page after page of her pure life unfolded, I have watched its developments, and learned more and more, how much the sinless purity of heaven can be linked to the frail cumbrances of earth. But in my later visits to her father's house, I read something in her countenance that disturbed me. I became haunted with the idea that sorrow was corroding her heart-a sorrow<pb n=""/> which was in some way connected with her affections. Perhaps it was only a fancy of mine; I earnestly trust that I may have judged wrongly-Nettie; but the assurance from your lips that I have been mistaken, would make me happier-can you give me this assurance?"</p> 
               <p>"She ever spoke of herself, as of one unusually blessed," answered Nettie, "and seemed to believe that she had been called upon to encounter very few of the trials or sorrows incident to this life."</p> 
               <p>"And you have had no reason to suppose that she ever became involved in any unfortunate attachment?" asked the Doctor.</p> 
               <p>Nettie hesitated for a moment.</p> 
               <p>"Elva was naturally very warm-hearted, and loved her friends devotedly;" she replied at length, somewhat evasively,-"and unless affection for her parents, and brother, and those of us who have been her particular friends, be called unfortunate, I can safely answer you in the negative. You may not have penetrated the truth, Dr. Milford, in your suspicions; for why should <emph>any</emph> attachment of Elva Lee's have been unhappy? She could <emph>never</emph> have <emph>loved</emph> an unworthy object."</p> 
               <p>"No!" replied the Doctor, "unless deceived, she could not; but, Nettie, there are surely many ways in which an attachment may be rendered unfortunate: it may be wholly unknown to its object; it may be unappreciated; or if fully<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC5768-00000097"/> appreciated and returned, there may exist a thousand inseparable barriers to the union of loving hearts on earth, which can never be overleaped or broken down. But as you remark, I <emph>may</emph> have been mistaken; I will endeavor to hope it, for I could not endure the thought that <emph>she</emph> had ever tasted of the griefs with which my own heart has become so familiar!"</p> 
               <p>Doctor Milford paused, as if he had perhaps said too much in the excitement of his feelings, and for a moment the silence remained unbroken.</p> 
               <p>"You have known sorrow then?" Nettie at last ventured to remark, in a tone of sympathy.</p> 
               <p>"Yes!" returned the physician sadly, "sorrows and afflictions have been multiplied upon me from my earliest manhood. Nettie, you may think my words strange, for I do not often speak of myself-but to-night I feel an irresistible longing for human sympathy. I have no sister <emph>now,</emph> no near relative in this broad world in whom I can confide; for my parents and my only sister are sleeping together, the long sleep. I know the sincerity of your friendship, Nettie, and have no apprehensions that you could be capable of abusing any confidence which I might repose in you; my only fear is that such confidence might not be desired, or might become burthensome."</p> 
               <p>"Do not indulge for a moment the ungenerous thought!" exclaimed Nettie quickly, her warm heart responding to the<pb n=""/> Doctor's emotion, "if you but deem me worthy of the sacred place, I will gladly be unto you as a sister."</p> 
               <p>"And I will be to you the most faithful and grateful of brothers!" replied Doctor Milford with energy.</p> 
               <p>"And now, Nettie," he continued, earnestly, "I would ask you as a sister, do you suppose Elva Lee ever knew, or suspected, that I entertained for her an attachment stronger than that of friendship?"</p> 
               <p>"I <emph>know</emph> that she did not! Doctor Milford, did you indeed love her?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Nettie-ardently, devotedly!"</p> 
               <p>"But you never told her this?"</p> 
               <p>"No-never!"</p> 
               <p>"Why-oh! why did you not?" exclaimed Nettie vehemently; then checking herself suddenly, she added, "Did you fear that your affection would not be reciprocated?"</p> 
               <p>"I did not ask myself the question, but I sincerely hoped that my feelings were neither suspected nor returned."</p> 
               <p>"Why, Dr. Milford-why?"</p> 
               <p>"Because such an attachment between <emph>us,</emph> could only be productive of misery to us both. I therefore studiously endeavored to conceal from her the true nature of my feelings, but I have sometimes fancied she suspected them, and-yes-and that she also loved me. Your words to-night have given me great relief upon these points."</p> 
               <pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC5768-00000098"/> 
               <p>"But if you had each possessed the affections of the other, why should it have been the occasion of sorrow?"</p> 
               <p>"I will tell you, Nettie. When I was a mere youth, I became violently enamored of a lovely girl of about my own age who resided in my native village, and by whom my passion was as ardently returned. Her parents were wealthy, and as at that time my own parents were also independent, our attachment was favored by both families, and we were soon engaged-with the understanding upon the part of our friends, that the marriage should be deferred until I should reach my majority. Meanwhile, my father entered largely into various speculations, most of which proved unsuccessful; and about six months previous to the time fixed upon for our union, he was declared bankrupt, and was shortly after taken ill, and died. My sister soon followed him, and I was left alone; my mother had been many years in her grave. Immediately after my father's failure, the father of my betrothed requested me to relinquish my claim to the hand of his daughter. This I readily agreed to do-provided his daughter, of her own free will joined in the request-but not otherwise. My pride was aroused by these mercenary motives that prompted her father, and I said to him, that should his daughter continue to regard the engagement as binding, our marriage should not take place until I should be able to satisfy him of my ability to support a wife comfortably and respectably. This arrangement appeared to satisfy the old<pb n=""/> gentleman for the time; but I afterward learned from Mary that he at first entreated, and then resorted to threats and commands for the purpose of inducing her to renounce me entirely. But Mary was not to be moved. She replied to her father, that she was willing to <emph>postpone</emph> our union to meet his wishes, but declared she would not free me, unless the request came from <emph>my</emph> lips, and that, even then, she would never marry another.</p> 
               <p>"We were not permitted to see each other as formerly at her father's," continued Doctor Milford, "but met occasionally by stratagem, at a neighbor's. As our interviews had to be effected with much caution and secresy, we could not be with each other as frequently as in happier days; and sometimes nearly a fortnight would elapse without a meeting. One morning, as I sat in my room sadly musing upon my loneliness, and the gloomy prospects before me, I was surprised by the sudden entrance of Mary's father. The old gentleman seemed greatly distressed, and without waiting to be seated, requested me to call as soon as possible at his house, as his daughter was dangerously ill, and desired to see me. He apologized for his former harshness, and bade me come to his house as often as I wished; and said if Heaven would restore his child once more to health, he would interpose no obstacles to our happiness. I hastened to obey the summons, and found Mary very ill, and much altered in appearance. She was able to speak but little, but appeared<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC5768-00000099"/> much gratified by my presence. I visited her frequently every day during her illness, which continued about a week, and then my Mary, like all my other earthly treasures, left me.</p> 
               <p>"Mary, like myself, had a romantic, enthusiastic disposition, and she entertained some views that you would perhaps pronounce singular. It was a favorite belief with her, that if one of a betrothed couple whose hearts were truly linked together here, should die before the consummation of their engagement, they would be united in another world, provided the survivor remained single through life, but not otherwise. So strongly was she persuaded of the truth of this theory, that during her illness she spoke very frequently and with much feeling of the possibility of my forming another matrimonial connection in the event of her death, and thus preventing our union hereafter. To me then, the idea of such a possibility was shocking. I loved Mary ardently, she alone filled my heart, and I felt that I never could love another. I told her this, as often as the subject was mentioned, but the impression had taken too strong hold upon her mind, and I could see that she was not fully satisfied. I was distressed that any doubt of my constancy should shadow her last days, and to remove every apprehension from her bosom, I gave to her a solemn promise never to marry unless she should be restored to health, and become my bride. She did not ask of me this pledge, but it evidently afforded her great relief; and when, a day or two after, my Mary breathed her last<pb n=""/> sigh, I was happy and thankful that I had sworn faithfulness to her memory, and freed her spirit from the severest pang of separation.</p> 
               <p>"You now know, Nettie, why any affection warmer than that which a brother or sister may entertain for each other, is forever forbidden to me, and if bestowed upon another must be productive of suffering and unhappiness, however strongly it might be reciprocated. Yes! whatever pangs I may endure in consequence of that promise, I cannot-no, I <emph>cannot</emph> break it!"</p> 
               <p>"Dr. Milford is called for:" said a servant, looking in at the door just as the Doctor finished his narration. Carefully securing Elva's precious gift, Dr. Milford immediately arose, and bade Nettie good night.</p> 
               <p>For some time after his departure, Nettie remained upon the sofa reflecting upon the incidents of the evening. "Shall I do right," she asked herself, "if, after what has been related to me, I allow the Doctor to remain ignorant of poor Elva's real sentiments towards him?"</p> 
               <p>"Yet what benefit would it be now to him, should I reveal the true state of her heart?" was the mental self-interrogation in reply.</p> 
               <p>"It would explain satisfactorily the mystery of Elva's first refusal to give him the ringlet he desired, and account for the change he had observed in her manner;-and would assure him that he had not loved alone.</p> 
               <pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC5768-00000100"/> 
               <p>"But that knowledge would only add to his present distress; besides, I have no <emph>right</emph> to communicate more than I have done already. I will not tell him-it will be better that he remain in ignorance of the truth;" and Nettie, having settled upon this conclusion, retired to her own room.</p>

               <p>AFTER breakfasting on the following morning, Nettie set out for the widow's cottage. Dr. Milford had been there before her, and pronounced the babe much improved; consequently, Mrs. Merton was in better spirits than Nettie had expected. She was full of gratitude for the Doctor's kindness to herself and family, and expressed her opinion that no other physician in Elville was worthy of a comparison with him, and Nettie certainly coincided remarkably with the good woman in this estimate of his character. As the nurse had arrived, and Nettie could not perceive that her own assistance would be material, she soon took her leave, promising to call as often as necessary.</p> 
               <p>Having a few purchases to make on this morning, she dropped in at the principal millinery and fancy establishment of the village upon her route homewards. The shop to which Nettie had directed her steps, was kept by a Mr. Harley and<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC5768-00000101"/> wife; the latter, well known in Elville as a woman of uncommon shrewdness and intelligence; and as remarkable perhaps for her indifference to external appearances, as for her powers of sarcasm and ever-ready wit. Nettie had long been acquainted with Mrs. Harley, and had often tarried awhile in her shop, listening to her usually entertaining and sprightly conversation. Upon this occasion, while awaiting the completion of some work then in Mrs. Harley's hands for her mother, a gentleman apparently about thirty-five years of years entered the shop, and commenced a conversation with Mr. Harley. He was well and fashionably dressed, was fine looking, and altogether, as he entered, presented quite a distinguished and gentlemanly exterior.</p> 
               <p>"Do you know the name of that gentleman?" asked Mrs. Harley of Nettie, in a low tone, "but of course you do," she added, "for he is one of the wild beasts of Elville! He is a <emph>lion</emph>-one of two that strayed into town not quite a fortnight ago; of course, as you belong to the <emph>elite,</emph> you <emph>must</emph> have seen him, for they have been <emph>showing</emph> him up ever since his arrival."</p> 
               <p>"I never so much as looked upon his face before," replied Nettie, smiling, "but I presume from your account of him that he must be one of the strangers from New York, of whom I have heard frequent mention. I have not mingled at all in society since they came. Is this Mr. Beesley or Mr. Sanford?"</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Sanford," answered Mrs. Harley. "How do you like his looks?"</p> 
               <p>"Very well," answered Nettie, casting a furtive glance, "but his countenance is more prepossessing than his manners or conversation, I should judge; from his airs, at this distance," she added, "I infer that he is not destitute of a modicum of self-esteem. The first person singular is evidently of no mean consequence in his eyes."</p> 
               <p>"He is a perfect puff-ball," whispered Mrs. Harley, "but it won't take <emph>you</emph> long to make <emph>that</emph> discovery for yourself, I reckon. He is talking about you now and looking this way; I'll venture he has been asking Mr. Harley for an introduction. I wish you could just hear him talk as <emph>I've</emph> heard him once."</p> 
               <p>While this dialogue was in progress, the gentleman who was its subject was engaged in conversation with Mr. Harley at the lower end of the shop. He spoke in a rather loud and excited tone, and the monosyllable <emph>I</emph> frequently intermingled with his remarks, and was pronounced with much emphasis and unction, and an occasional laying down of the hand upon the counter, in a manner evidently intended to be exceedingly impressive. Although the ladies gave no particular attention to the conversation of the gentlemen, they could not avoid, now and then, overhearing a remark; and from what reached their ears, they gathered that Mr. Sanford was speaking of the female sex. As Mrs. Harley concluded her last observation<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC5768-00000102"/> vation, Nettie heard her own name mentioned by the stranger in a slight under-tone, and, after a moment's hesitation, Mr. Harley advanced towards them. He informed Nettie that Mr. Sanford had expressed a wish to be introduced to her, and desired to know whether the presentation of that gentleman would be agreeable. Nettie assented.</p> 
               <p>"I have heard you spoken of quite frequently since my arrival in town, Miss Carrol," said Mr. Sanford-the introduction having taken place-giving his whiskers, at the same time, a complacent stroke; "but I believe I have never before had the pleasure of seeing you. You are very much of a recluse, are you not?"</p> 
               <p>"Not in the least, I believe," replied Nettie. "I am accustomed to mixing a good deal in society, and enjoy it very much."</p> 
               <p>"But I have attended one large party, and two or three little 'sociables,' I believe they call them here, and I am certain you were present at none of them, although I have been informed you were invited to all," said the gentleman.</p> 
               <p>"I have recently lost a very dear friend, Mr. Sanford, and since her death have felt little inclination for general society; consequently I have, latterly, kept myself much at home."</p> 
               <p>"Home! yes-home! That's the true place for a woman, Miss Carrol!" exclaimed Mr. Sanford with pomposity,<pb n=""/> "women should be keepers at <emph>home,</emph> instead of gadders abroad, and spinners of street-yarn, <emph>I</emph> think, don't you?"</p> 
               <p>"I think woman should <emph>love</emph> home, and endeavor to find there her chief happiness," said Nettie with dignity; "and this I believe she generally will do," she continued, "if properly educated, and properly appreciated by those who constitute her home circle. I do not think that domestic duties should be neglected or made secondary to any others-but sir," and Nettie's eye flashed a little, "I do <emph>not</emph> hold the opinion that because home should, as a general thing, constitute her central sphere, the influence of woman should never be permitted to extend beyond it. I believe her to be capable of <emph>improving</emph> as well as adorning society, and that the power which she may properly exert beyond her own household, is both important and extensive."</p> 
               <p>"But, Miss Carrol, <emph>I</emph> was speaking more particularly of spinners of street-yarn," said Mr. Sandford, with a perplexed look.</p> 
               <p>"Yes sir, I understood you, I believe," returned Nettie, "and to answer your question more directly, I will say, that I can see no reason why woman does not possess as good a right to breathe the free, pure air of heaven as any of <emph>that</emph> sex that arrogate to themselves so many greater privileges."</p> 
               <p>"Ah! I see you are a strong advocate of the new-fangled doctrine of the 'rights of woman,' as it is called," said Mr. Sanford. "In some respects your views would not clash<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC5768-00000103"/> with mine <emph>very</emph> materially; for example-I think with you, that the ladies should go out occasionally for a little fresh air, for they would soon fade and perhaps die, were we to make them house up <emph>all</emph> the time; and I believe too, that they <emph>do</emph> exert a sort of an influence in society-yes, most unquestionably they do-greater than they should, perhaps-and, I'm sure an evening party would be a monstrous dull place without them. So you see we shall agree in some respects.</p> 
               <p>"It is also my opinion," he continued, "that more attention should be given to the education of ladies, than has been; I'm sure you will agree with me in <emph>that,</emph> for the more education they have of a <emph>suitable</emph> kind, the better wives and mothers they will make for us men. I would allow them the best of instructors, and in mathematical studies particularly, I would have them taught by <emph>men.</emph> Mr. Harley and I have just been engaged in a little dispute, or rather discussion upon that very point. He professes to think, that a woman may be as capable of teaching such studies as a man, but <emph>I</emph> tell him there can be no such thing."</p> 
               <p>"Why not, Mr. Sanford?"</p> 
               <p>"Because, Miss Carrol, there cannot; woman is not calculated for it."</p> 
               <p>"And yet you think such studies should form a branch of her education?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly, by all means. They are very useful and<pb n=""/> improving to the mind, and she should have them taught her properly."</p> 
               <p>"You think, then, she <emph>could</emph> be made to understand mathematics?" asked Nettie.</p> 
               <p>"O yes,-to some extent," was the reply.</p> 
               <p>"I should suppose," said Mrs. Harley, "if she could be taught anything so as to understand it, she might be able to impart her knowledge to others."</p> 
               <p>"You are quite mistaken, madam-it is not at all the case. Ladies may answer to teach <emph>some</emph> branches, but they are not competent to teach mathematics, no matter how thoroughly they may understand them."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> have met with ladies who have greatly <emph>excelled</emph> in mathematical studies, Mr. Sanford," said Nettie, "and gentlemen of acknowledged talent and education have unhesitatingly admitted their superiority."</p> 
               <p>"So have I!" chimed in Mrs. Harley.</p> 
               <p>"Very likely-" returned Mr. Sanford. "I have heard of a few such specimens in my life, but still, I insist they could not have made good teachers."</p> 
               <p>"Will you have the goodness to give us proof of the truth of your assertions, Mr. Sanford?" asked Mrs. Harley, somewhat tartly.</p> 
               <p>"It does not require proof madam," returned the gentleman. "It is a self-evident fact-all experience goes to<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC5768-00000104"/> prove its truth. You see they lack the faculty of <emph>explaining</emph> clearly," he added, turning to Nettie.</p> 
               <p>"But suppose, Mr. Sanford, a lady had received her instruction from a gentleman of the most eminent capacity, and should be blessed with so fertile a memory as to retain everything taught her, and if necessary, perhaps employ the very manner and language of her instructor, in imparting her lessons to others-would she not be as competent a teacher as a gentleman?"</p> 
               <p>"Not by any means, Miss Carrol. She would probably make a much <emph>better</emph> teacher than most of her sex, but a man, with only half her knowledge, would make a far better in-instructor. I do not say now <emph>why</emph> this is so-but I <emph>know</emph> the principle is correct. I have taught school enough in my day, to have a pretty good chance to ascertain <emph>some</emph> things. Have you ever taught, Miss Carrol?"</p> 
               <p>"No sir; and never have thought I should fancy the occupation."</p> 
               <p>"Indeed! well then, I do not agree with you there. I taught because I had a fondness for it-there was no necessity of my resorting to the occupation as a means of livelihood. It was a source of pleasure, and served to give me employment at the same time;-the idea of gain was not taken into consideration. I have taught a great deal, and don't know but I shall undertake it again some of these days. I have a brother, residing about twenty miles from this<pb n=""/> place, who has a few thousand dollars lying idle, and as I have about as much more that I hardly know what to do with, and rather like Elville, I think I shall persuade him to join me in purchasing Mr. Wenton's grove and erecting a Seminary that shall be a credit to the place. Did you ever hear that I had taught, Miss Carrol?"</p> 
               <p>"I never did-but I thought probably you had," returned Nettie.</p> 
               <p>"Why so? from my conversation?"</p> 
               <p>"No sir-not so much from that, as from your manners!" was the prompt reply.</p> 
               <p>"What in my manners indicated the teacher?"</p> 
               <p>"You will excuse me from answering the question, Mr. Sanford."</p> 
               <p>"Certainly-if I <emph>must:</emph> perhaps you will not object to state why you are opposed to teaching? I really should like to know."</p> 
               <p>"I ask your pardon, Mr. Sanford-but I did not say that I was opposed to teaching, nor did I expect to be so understood; on the contrary, I consider it a highly important and honorable, as well as responsible calling; but at the same time, one that taxes the patience more than any other; and, if pursued for many years together, one that is most certain to injure the disposition of the instructor, and impress upon him a certain <emph>manner,</emph> which is far from being agreeable to most persons. I have met with honorable exceptions to this<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC5768-00000105"/> rule, it is true, but not many. I only said, sir, that for myself, I should not <emph>fancy</emph> teaching."</p> 
               <p>"I understand you now, Miss Carrol, I think perfectly," said Mr. Sanford; "but as you are undoubtedly so much better informed upon this subject than myself, will you have the goodness to enlighten me still further? I would be glad to know in what respect even <emph>continued</emph> teaching, injures the disposition or affects the manners-will you tell?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly, Mr. Sanford, if you desire it, I have no objection to stating my views upon the subject. In the first place, it is apt to make a person fretful, pedantic, and impatient of the slightest contradiction, and sometimes renders him intolerant of any expressed difference of opinion. In the second place, it tends to encourage in him an exaggerating self-importance, and an oracular manner (of which he may be wholly unconscious), making him dictatorial and overbearing in his intercourse with others. Accustomed ever to exact and receive implicit obedience from his pupils, he carries the habit with him into other associations, and attempts to play the schoolmaster among his equals, forgetful that his assumptions may not <emph>there</emph> be always recognized, or permitted."</p> 
               <p>"I should wish to preserve a lofty and <emph>commanding</emph> manner," said Mr. Sanford, with emphasis, "in my government; my family should be held in awe by my presence. Yes, Miss Carrol," he added; "when <emph>I</emph> marry, I wish my wife<pb n=""/> to understand her duty from my very glance. The future Mrs. Sanford must be pretty and smart; and she must love me; but she must also learn to make <emph>my</emph> will <emph>her</emph> law!"</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps she might not be pleased to do so?" suggested Mrs. Harley.</p> 
               <p>"Pleased or not pleased, she will <emph>do</emph> it!" returned the gentleman, bringing down his hand decidedly. "I should not mind it if she <emph>was</emph> a little wilful at first," he added, "for I could soon tame her. You've read the 'Taming of the Shrew' I presume. Well, let <emph>my</emph> 'Kate' be wilful if she likes, and she will soon find that <emph>I</emph> can manage, as well as Petruchio. It would not be long before she would acknowledge me her 'rightful lord' and sovereign; and then, when she became properly submissive, she would be rewarded with a Petruchio's love."</p> 
               <p>"A happy woman <emph>your</emph> wife would be!" remarked Mrs. Harley.</p> 
               <p>"My wife will be happy enough, unless she attempts to disobey my injunctions, or questions my authority. Do you not think so, Mrs. Harley?"</p> 
               <p>"I don't think you will ever marry," answered Mrs. Harley, evasively.</p> 
               <p>"Oh yes I shall! I mean to marry very soon. Miss Carrol, don't you think I can find a nice little wife in Elville?"</p> 
               <p>Nettie turned her back upon him without deigning a reply.</p> 
               <pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC5768-00000106"/> 
               <p>"This young lady will not answer me," persisted Mr. Sanford, turning his attention again to Mrs. Harley. "What do <emph>you</emph> think my chance would be here?"</p> 
               <p>"Poor enough," was the reply. "I do not imagine there is a young lady in the place that would suit you."</p> 
               <p>"And why not, pray?"</p> 
               <p>"Because as far as <emph>I</emph> know them, they have pretty decided minds of their own."</p> 
               <p>"All owing to a bad bringing up, Mrs. Harley! Now, madam, it is a positive fact there is not a <emph>single woman,</emph> or rather, I should say an <emph>individual</emph> woman in this whole community who is capable of bringing up children at all as they should be."</p> 
               <p>Now Mrs. Harley was herself the mother of several interesting and promising children, and these wholesale charges naturally touched her pride not a little.</p> 
               <p>"I should like to know how you came by this knowledge, sir," she asked, rather sharply.</p> 
               <p>"By observation, Mrs. Harley. It is by observation, madam, that the greatest truths are learned. Newton, you know, by the simple falling of an apple, discovered the great law of-of-Gravitation, I believe it was; and in a like way, <emph>we</emph> may discover important facts-that is, by observation."</p> 
               <p>"But what opportunity have <emph>you</emph> had for making this grand discovery regarding the education or 'bringing up' of<pb n=""/> children in Elville, by means of observation? Pray how long have you been in the place, Mr. Sanford?"</p> 
               <p>"Not long, madam, to be sure," replied the gentleman, with a very slight degree of embarrassment, "about three weeks or so, I believe-(it was a little more than two)-and I have observed a deal in that time. I judge of course from what I have heard and seen only; but Newton, you know, didn't see <emph>twenty</emph> apples fall; he only saw one, and he decided upon <emph>that,</emph> and the great truth he discovered was as much the truth as if he had seen the twenty-yes, a hundred! Why is it, Mrs. Harley, that children do not obey their mother as readily as they do their father?"</p> 
               <p>"They do-at least, <emph>my</emph> children do," returned Mrs. Harley, quickly.</p> 
               <p>"I'll be bound for it, they do not," said Mr. Sanford, with a magisterial air. "It is contrary to reason; they can't be made to do it-not one out of a thousand. How is it Harley?"</p> 
               <p>"I would not suffer a child of mine to remain under our roof, that would not obey his mother as promptly as myself," replied Mr. Harley, rather angrily; for he had been standing a little apart listening to the conversation, and every now and then, seemed debating within himself whether the proper moment had come for kicking the self-conceited coxcomb into the street. He possessed a large share of forbearance, however, and continued, "Mrs. Harley always <emph>has</emph> governed her children, and is fully capable of doing so hereafter."</p> 
               <pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC5768-00000107"/> 
               <p>"Ah! well, I suppose I shall have to credit what you say, but I shall certainly set this down as a remarkable exception. I do not believe it is so anywhere else."</p> 
               <p>"It is so in <emph>every</emph> well-regulated family," said Mrs. Harley, warmly; "and the only reason why a mother is <emph>ever</emph> habitually disobeyed by her children, during their childhood, at least, when such <emph>is</emph> the case, is either because they see her treated with disrespect, or as an inferior by the father, or else because she is too indulgent to maintain a steady hand in government."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, <emph>there's</emph> the point exactly, Mrs. Harley. 'She is too indulgent, and can't maintain a steady hand at government,' but <emph>why</emph> can't she? The reason is plain. She lacks judgment, she lacks firmness; the child whines, and she is subdued. She can't help it, for she was made to be yielding. If that is not the reason, why does not the father let the children run over <emph>him? He</emph> don't spoil them by indulgences very often, I can promise you. The fact is, man was made to be the head, and the woman the heart."</p> 
               <p>"Good many <emph>block</emph>-heads in the world," muttered Mrs. Harley; but Mr. Sanford, appearing not to make the application, continued:</p> 
               <p>"You can't dispute that proposition, can you?"</p> 
               <p>"That what?"</p> 
               <p>"That a father does not often spoil his children by indulgence, or permit them to contemn his authority."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"I confess they do not very often," said Mrs. Harley; "but that is not owing to their superior government, but because they are less with their children. I have known fathers who, when confined to their homes by indisposition or other cause, would yield and temporize with their children, far more than under similar circumstances their mothers have done, for the sake of peace and qniet; and it is my firm belief, as a general thing, were fathers compelled to be as much and as constantly with their children as their mothers, they would either ruin them by excessive indulgence, or else, flying to the other extreme, would crush them in body and spirit by the exercise of harshness and tyranny. I have seen men too, who have prided themselves on the strictness of <emph>their</emph> family government, whose sons have become notorious for their dissipation, ingratitude and disobedience. It's my opinion, if any man was placed in a woman's situation for awhile, he would soon learn that there is quite as much occasion for <emph>brain</emph> in her sphere as in his."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I believe you were cut out for a lawyer, anyway," said Mr. Sanford, walking towards the door; "but you must not think because you have <emph>talked</emph> me down, that you have convinced me. I am not to be beaten out of an opinion so easily, I can tell you. I have not time to argue with you any longer, for I must be going. So you think there is not much chance of my getting a wife in Elville?"</p> 
               <p>"No, I don't know of any body who would fancy you."</p> 
               <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC5768-00000108"/> 
               <p>The gentleman stepped out, closing the door after him with some vigor.</p> 
               <p>"What an impudent puppy!" exclaimed Mrs. Harley. "Well, Nettie, is he not as I said, a perfect puff-ball? What do you think now of this fine-looking gentleman?"</p> 
               <p>"I think him the most contemptible specimen of mankind I ever met with, and I am angry with myself for having condescended to talk with him so much," answered Nettie, "and I believe I should not have done so," she continued, "had I not been at first about as much amused as vexed with his egotism. I hope, for poor humanity's sake, the world contains but few who entertain such despicable sentiments as he has just expressed in our hearing."</p> 
               <p>"You hope in vain, then," replied Mrs. Harley; "for the world is full of those who hold precisely such opinions, though there are not many so devoid of tact and common sense as to express their views in such plain terms. I hope, in conscience, <emph>he</emph> can never get a wife, for he would make her shed tears of blood, before she had lived with him a twelvemonth. I am glad you talked with him though, for you drew him out, so that you now know precisely what he is; if you had not yourself heard him, you would never have believed that a person of his gentlemanly exterior could enact such a scene as we have just witnessed.</p> 
               <p>"Nettie," continued Mrs. Harley, "look out for the Sanfords, for they are many. Unfortunately, most of them are<pb n=""/> cautious enough to keep the cloven-foot concealed, until some poor creature is tied to them 'for better or worse.' Don't marry in haste, Nettie, for if you do, you will be most certain to repent at leisure. Know well the man to whom you give your heart; and if you wish for any <emph>real</emph> happiness, never unite your fate with one who would advocate or avow a theory so degrading to our sex, or would consign you to perpetual and hopeless inferiority. Better-a thousand times better, never marry at all. <emph>You,</emph> at least, are not afraid to lead a single life."</p> 
               <p>"No indeed, Mrs. Harley; and you may be sure I shall not blindly, or thoughtlessly, enter upon a state which must involve the happiness or misery of an entire life. It would not disturb me at all, if I never should change my condition; for I am not one of those who regard old maids with disrespect, or fear to become one of their number. But-" added Nettie, recollecting herself suddenly, "I am making quite a visit;" and taking up the little package containing her purchases, she quitted the shop.</p>

               <p>NOT many days after the incidents narrated in the last chapter, Nettie received a morning call from Susan Champell, who came to request the pleasure of her company to tea that afternoon.</p> 
               <p>"I am only going to gather a few acquaintances," she said; "no strangers-no gentlemen,-but just an old-fashioned, sociable visit. You will be sure and come, wont you? Come very early."</p> 
               <p>"I will try to do both," answered Nettie, "but I am afraid I shall not be able to go <emph>very</emph> early, for I am at present the main-stay in the kitchen."</p> 
               <p>"Why what has become of your cook?" asked Susan.</p> 
               <p>"Sarah was complaining all day yesterday, and hardly able to keep about," answered Nettie; "and this morning she was obliged to give up entirely, and go to bed. As there is baking and almost everything else to be done, I fancy I shall have rather a busy day of it."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"How provoking!" exclaimed Susan; "don't it vex you to have to go into the kitchen so?"</p> 
               <p>"I confess I do sometimes find it rather inconvenient to be called upon to take all the household cares upon myself so unexpectedly; still, it is nothing to what it would be, if mother had allowed me to grow up in ignorance of those duties, or if I had not obtained a good share of my knowledge by actual experience. Mother considered it her duty to have me well trained in the art and science of cookery, and other domestic affairs; and for this purpose, I was, for several years, required to spend a portion of each day in exercising this branch of practical education. It was at first rather irksome, but I gradually learned to like it-and when my apprenticeship was over, I voluntarily took upon myself the office of housekeeper, for the double purpose of perfecting my own knowledge, and at the same time relieving my mother of a great charge."</p> 
               <p>"Well, you <emph>are</emph> a queer girl, Nettie, that's a fact! I suppose it's well enough to know <emph>how</emph> to do those things, but I don't think I should fancy <emph>doing</emph> them at all; I am glad enough <emph>my</emph> mother did not take it into her head, that my education could not be finished, without my learning all sorts of drudgery. She thought, I reckon, that it would be time enough for that when I should be obliged to do such things, if that day should ever come; and I think so too. But as I never expect to see that day, I don't mean to worry myself<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC5768-00000110"/> self about my ignorance of what you are pleased to dignify with the name of <emph>science.</emph> 'The art and science of cookery!' Well-well!" continued Susan laughing, "I expect I shall hear one of these times that Professor Nettie Carrol is to deliver a course of lectures on Domestic Economy, and 'The art and science of Cookery!' You may calculate on me to be one of your subscribers, Nettie; but I shall not promise, even then, to learn anything more than the theory."</p> 
               <p>Nettie smiled. "Do you ever mean to marry?" she asked.</p> 
               <p>"What a funny question, Nettie! I'm sure I don't know-I don't think much about it. I <emph>may</emph> marry some time or other, if I should take a fancy to. Why?"</p> 
               <p>"If you do, I suppose you will never think of keeping house, will you?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly I should keep house,-but I see what you are aiming at now. You think I would <emph>then</emph> feel the need of such knowledge-but when I take that step, I mean to be supplied with servants who understand their business."</p> 
               <p>"But, Susan, they are not always to be had; and if you were to succeed in getting such as you liked, you would still be liable to be left without, at a moment's warning, almost any time."</p> 
               <p>"No, Nettie-for I would pay them the best of wages, and treat them so kindly they could not be persuaded to leave me."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"But suppose your cook should be taken sick, as Sarah has been to-day, what would you do then?"</p> 
               <p>"Why-well-O I would make the housemaid get dinner, and do the work, until I could get more help, I suppose."</p> 
               <p>"But suppose, Susan," continued Nettie, determined to persevere in her cross-examination, until she should get her friend to acknowledge the necessity of domestic culture; "suppose your husband should be unable or unwilling to provide you with more than one domestic?"</p> 
               <p>"If he really could not <emph>afford</emph> to let me have more than one servant, and such a thing should happen, I would try and fix up a good cold bite for dinner somehow; but if he was able and unwilling, he might make out as he could. I shouldn't trouble myself much about his dinner."</p> 
               <p>"Well, Susan, let us imagine one case more. Suppose your husband to be everything that you could desire-solicitous for your happiness, and anxious to make your life an easy one; and suppose, too, that his means would not admit of the luxury of two servants, and this was a matter which you well knew; then-with your only servant sick, and none to be found to supply her place during this illness; or, if you should succeed in procuring a substitute, the new servant should prove to be utterly ignorant, and require direction in everything-how would you then manage?"</p> 
               <p>"Why I would send for mother of course, or some of her help," answered Susan triumphantly.</p> 
               <pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC5768-00000111"/> 
               <p>"But what if you were far away from your parents, or had a mother no longer?"</p> 
               <p>"O Nettie! what a preacher you are! I declare you have confused me so that I hardly know what I <emph>would</emph> do. I suppose that I should manage to get along in some way though, as well as others have done who have known no more than myself. But honestly, Nettie, I wish I <emph>could</emph> know as much as you do about such things, without the trouble of learning. What are you going to do in the kitchen today?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh! a good deal. I intend to bake bread, and pies, and get dinner and clear it away, and to do a hundred other things which I presume you would know no more about were I to tell you," replied Nettie, laughing.</p> 
               <p>"And it don't vex you at all?"</p> 
               <p>"Not a bit."</p> 
               <p>"Well you are a queer girl, Nettie, that's all I can say about you. But what a jewel of a wife you would make though; if I was a gentleman I wouldn't let you have any peace until you agreed to marry me. But why don't you let your mother help you do those things?"</p> 
               <p>"Mother is not very well: besides, she will have plenty to do in other parts of the house-for you must know enough of housekeeping to understand that in a family like ours, one servant cannot be expected to accomplish more than a limited portion of the necessary labor. Mother generally makes<pb n=""/> the pastry, but to-day she has taken upon herself most of my usual duties, and the care of Sarah in addition; and I have undertaken, with the assistance of little Fanny, to get along with whatever is to be done in the kitchen. Indeed Susan, I should be ashamed to see my mother performing any laborious household duty, from which I was capable of relieving her-would not you?"</p> 
               <p>"I really don't know," said Susan in reply: "the fact is, I never knew my mother to do hardly anything that could be called work, except with her needle, so I don't know how I should feel. You remember we have a sort of upper cook and housekeeper, all in one, who has lived with us ever since I can recollect: as she understands everything, mother always lets her do all the cake-baking, preserving, pickling and other things of that sort, and has no care about it herself, at all. Mother says she knows how all these are done though, for when she was a girl, every young lady of good family was expected to be well acquainted, at least with the <emph>theory</emph> of cooking; but as far as the practice is concerned, I guess she would prefer being excused, as well as her daughter.</p> 
               <p>"But I won't keep you any longer from your delightful exercises," continued Susan; "pray excuse me for having hindered you so long. If I had time, I would like to follow you into the kitchen, in order to witness your performances there, and enjoy the benefit of your <emph>example,</emph> having already<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC5768-00000112"/> had precept upon precept-thanks to you Nettie. Perhaps, too," she added, rising, "I might assist you a little; but as I really have not time, I will go my way, hoping you will not forget your promise to be at our house as early as possible."</p> 
               <p>Nettie <emph>did</emph> endeavor to get through with her work in season to be early at Mr. Champell's house, for she was much attached to Susan, and enjoyed her society; and notwithstanding a few prominent faults, knew her to be a well-meaning, and in most respects, an amiable and sensible young lady. Miss Champell was usually sprightly and entertaining in her conversation, was prepossessing in her personal appearance, and usually graceful in her manners. But when in the society of those she really disliked, she became chillingly dignified, and sometimes haughty. Her faults, however, were not of as grave a character as might naturally have been expected from the extreme indulgence with which she had been treated by her mother, from her earliest childhood; or from the few restraints which that lady had seen fit to impose upon her daughter's most wayward inclinations; for Susan was neither wilful nor selfish. Mrs. Champell's leading defect, was a love of personal ease that amounted to downright indolence, and this characteristic was inherited, though in a less degree, by her daughter. She unquestionably desired her child's best welfare, and frequently bestowed upon her most excellent advice and instruction; and it was probably owing in a great measure to this circumstance, that<pb n=""/> Susan did not become, like most greatly indulged children, completely spoiled.</p> 
               <p>Susan's chief failing, Nettie considered to be, her wavering disposition, and instability of character. Though on some points firm in her opinion, she was in general too easily influenced by the opinions of others. She was sensitive to ridicule, and sought to escape it by identifying herself with the most popular of contending parties, when occasion required her to side with either. Though she would never join in the abuse of an absent friend, she had not the courage to defend them from calumny when assailed, unless supported by powerful assistance; consequently, she was little to be depended upon as a firm and constant friend save "in good report." This unfortunate disposition had been more apparent in Susan during her earlier youth than at present, and it was to this alone that Nettie attributed the share which she had apparently taken in the mysterious affair that had caused her friend Blanche so much distress, some four years before. Nettie could never decide what part Susan had borne in the transaction, but she had not attributed to her any active agency in the matter, further than having been made privy to the plot, under a promise of secresy. She judged thus, because she had too much faith in Susan's native kindness of heart to believe that she would participate in so cruel an affair; and also, from the uniform kindness and affection with which she had treated Blanche nearly up<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC5768-00000113"/> to the time of its occurrence; and again after the excitement had in some measure died away, she had redoubled her attentions, as if to atone for past coldness and neglect. At times, it is true, both Blanche and Nettie thought it possible that Susan had really been induced to believe that the former was guilty of what had been laid to her charge, but they entertained no hope of arriving at any knowledge of this through her; for Susan had never been known to reveal any secret intrusted to her keeping. However, they were satisfied that whatever had been Susan's complicity, she had been drawn into it by others, and had given abundant evidence of her sorrow and shame that she had been in any way connected with it; and Blanche's heart long ago had pronounced her pardon.</p> 
               <p>The other young ladies, whom Blanche had with such good reason suspected of originating the disgraceful affair, now treated her with much respect and attention, and the most distant allusions to the subject was never made by them in the presence of either Nettie or herself; indeed the mention of Miss Belmont's name, was strictly avoided. It was not natural for Blanche to cherish unkind feelings in her heart, and she therefore had received their courtesies in a friendly manner, and after a time mingled with them as before; although an occasional doubt of the sincerity of their friendship would intrude itself even upon <emph>her</emph> mind.</p> 
               <p>As we have digressed somewhat from our narrative, and<pb n=""/> shall not again refer to the Academy at Elville, it may be well to state that the Institution did not now enjoy the popularity of its earlier days, and received little patronage from abroad. Mr. Castlebury and Miss Belmont had resigned their situations, and left the village some three years before, and the former had gone on a sea voyage for the benefit of his health, which had become much impaired. Of Miss Belmont little had been known since her departure, until, quite recently, Mrs. Carrol received a letter from her, stating that she had just married, and was about to start with her husband for a new home in the "far west," where they were to devote themselves to the arduous duties of a missionary life.</p>

               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING Nettie exerted herself considerably, in order to be early at Mrs. Champell's, it was nearly five o'clock when she reached her friend's residence.</p> 
               <p>"I am afraid that I am pretty late for a sociable visit," said she to Susan Champell, who joined her in the dressing-room, "but I did endeavor to get here much earlier."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, you <emph>are</emph> quite late, but <emph>you</emph> have a good reason for being so," returned Susan, "though the other girls cannot have any reasonable excuse at all for being so late, <emph>I</emph> know; they all promised me this morning that they would come very early, and yet you who did not promise, are almost the first one here, late as it is. Blanche came in about half an hour ago, and not a soul has appeared since."</p> 
               <p>"Where is Kate?" asked Nettie, "is she not coming?"</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Yes, I suppose so," replied Susan; "she was not ready, Blanche said, and didn't wish Blanche to wait for her, and I'm sure I am glad she didn't. How provoking it is to have people so wonderfully formal and fashionable, especially when one has particularly requested them to be otherwise. This morning, I really thought I should succeed in having a regular old-fashioned sociable visit with the few old friends whom I invited-such a visit as our mothers have so often told us about-but you see I am disappointed. The young ladies in <emph>this</emph> village, are quite too genteel to be caught in such an old-fashioned operation. I declare, Nettie, I'm heartily sick of this strained gentility-are not you?"</p> 
               <p>"I never could endure it," replied Nettie, "and I am becoming more and more disgusted with it every day. The way in which our village people strive to imitate the style and manners of city fashionables, is truly ridiculous; even in the most ordinary, every-day social intercourse, they must needs follow them."</p> 
               <p>"Follow," repeated Susan, as they proceeded to the parlor, "they do not follow, they go far beyond, especially in such matters as social visiting."</p> 
               <p>"What are you scolding about?" asked Blanche, as they entered.</p> 
               <p>"We are out of all patience with the lady-fashionables of Elville," replied Susan, smiling; "and have only been comparing opinions on the subject. I find Nettie's sentiments<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC5768-00000115"/> are in unison with yours and mine, Blanche, as we expressed them before her arrival."</p> 
               <p>"How many do you expect this afternoon?" asked Nettie.</p> 
               <p>"Besides yourself and Blanche, I invited only the Misses Crawford, Ellen Trenton, the Misses Edgeway, and Kate Belton. I said to them as I did to you both this morning, that I was intending to gather only a few of my early friends, but they seem to consider it essential to be as formal as if they were to attend a court ball. By the way, Nettie, I wish you and Blanche could have been at the party at the Trentons, not that you would have enjoyed the company very much, for I'm certain <emph>I</emph> did not; but that you might have been present to witness the conduct of some of our fashionable young ladies. I don't know how it would have answered though for Blanche to have been there," added Susan gaily, "for she is so addicted to taking notes of everything that passes under her eye, I'm afraid she would have made a formidable sketch on that occasion. You would undoubtedly have been completely disgusted, both of you, and perhaps a trifle amused with the manuvres of three or four of the young ladies present. You are aware, I presume, that the party was honored by the presence of two gentlemen from the city. These strangers were, in my view at least, naturally endowed with an ample stock of vanity and assurance; but had they been destitute of the former quality, they could hardly have left Mrs. Trenton's parlors in the same<pb n=""/> condition, for the young ladies to whom I allude, were untiring in their attentions, evidently thinking them the only gentlemen of consequence in the company. It was all Mr. Beesley or Mr. Sanford; and they talked, and they promenaded, and they waltzed, and danced polkas, appearing all the while highly delighted and flattered with the attentions of these gentlemen, until the company broke up. I heard one <emph>quite</emph> young lady tell Mr. Sanford that he must be sure and call on 'Sista' and herself <emph>very</emph> soon; another poured out romance by the quantity to Mr. Beesley, whom I fancy was rather too dull for her taste, for I heard him tell her that he had read very few novels himself, but Mr. Sanford had read everything in that way, and he presumed she would be much pleased with that gentleman. Still another young lady was in a perpetual smile, assenting to everything the gentlemen said, and appearing so yielding and gentle, that one who did not know her, would never have supposed her guilty of such a highhanded performance as thinking for herself. Now Blanche, do not attempt to guess the name of this last young lady, for you never could succeed, you must know; having never met with such a person in your life. I am not going to tell either of you who they were, for I don't think it right to call names.</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps," she continued, more seriously, "it may not be right to mention these things at all; but then, you are particular friends who had also invitations, and would have<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC5768-00000116"/> witnessed the same things had you accepted; for my eyes and ears were not alone in what they saw and heard that evening, nor was I the only person disgusted."</p> 
               <p>"No, I guess not," said Blanche, "for I have heard pretty much the same before. I was informed too, by an ear witness, that two young ladies, who are sisters (but I shall not call names either), one of whom is very romantic and the other quite young, actually compelled the gentlemen to dance with them, or what was the same thing. The eldest one said, 'Are you fond of waltzing, sir?' The gentleman replied, 'O yes, do <emph>you</emph> waltz?' 'I dote on it,' said the lady, 'suppose we take a turn or two when the music strikes up.' 'With the greatest pleasure,' said the gentleman; and so they waltzed, and then the younger was overheard saying to the other gentleman, 'Did I agree to dance the next figure with you?' 'I do not know that you did,' said the gentleman, 'but I should be most happy to receive the promise now,' and so <emph>they</emph> danced together. What a misfortune it is that those young ladies could not have had the benefit of better instruction at home. They are really quite pretty looking girls, and generally I think well disposed, and might have made as agreeable and valuable women as any of our acquaintance."</p> 
               <p>"It <emph>is</emph> a pity they have not had better advisers," said Susan; "but then they might have learned something from observation, one would think; and for me, I don't think that<pb n=""/> everything they do that is out of the way can be attributed to their ignorance, for they certainly know better than to solicit attention from strange gentlemen, and would be among the first to ridicule and censure such improprieties in any of their companions. I heard some of our village gentry," she continued, "speaking and laughing together that evening, about the great sensation the New Yorkers had made among some of the ladies, and <emph>their own</emph> diminished importance. They said several cutting things, but I could not blame them, they were so true. Now I believe, of course, that proper courtesy and attention should be extended to respectable strangers, but it is highly ridiculous to lavish upon them all the regard which we could bestow upon an old and tried friend; or to be captivated with them, to the neglect of our our own neighbors and friends, when for aught we know they may be only polished villains in the guise of gentlemen"</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Sanford, at least, is no gentleman," said Nettie, decidedly. "I discovered that during a call I made at Mrs. Harley's shop the other day; he came in while I was there, and his conversation betrayed plainly an utter want of good-breeding as well as the weakness of his brain."</p> 
               <p>"Did you converse with him?" inquired Susan.</p> 
               <p>"I am ashamed to say, I did," replied Nettie; "and I presume he left the shop with quite as unfavorable an opinion of me, as I did of him."</p> 
               <p>"Why, what <emph>did</emph> you talk about, pray, to impress each<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC5768-00000117"/> other so unfavorably?" asked Susan. "Come, tell us all about it. I am really curious to know."</p> 
               <p>Nettie then related the substance of the conversation which we have already given our readers, but any comment on the part of her listeners was prevented by the arrival of other guests. It was about six o'clock when Miss Trenton, the last of the company, made her appearance.</p> 
               <p>"I am late, I perceive," said she turning to Susan, with a look of surprise, as she entered the room; "all the company are here before me-yet I was afraid I should be almost the first one to arrive."</p> 
               <p>"Flo'lla and I have only <emph>just</emph> come," said Bella Craw-ford, eager to inform Miss Trenton that they had been nearly as fashionable as herself.</p> 
               <p>"And I have not been here long," chimed in Kate Belton.</p> 
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> supposed and feared that I should be quite late," said Blanche; "but I was the first, as well as the only guest for some time. I did not suppose it was intended to be a <emph>fashionable</emph> or ceremonious affair, and therefore did not attempt to make it so."</p> 
               <p>"Indeed!" said Miss Crawford; "and Miss Carrol, were you one of the first comers too?"</p> 
               <p>"Nettie was the next to appear," said Blanche, answering for her friend, "but she came armed with most excellent excuses for being so late. I think ladies," she continued, "if<pb n=""/> we could only contrive to be a little <emph>more</emph> formal with each other, we should enjoy society vastly."</p> 
               <p>"Blanche seems inclined to be a little sharp this evening," said Ellen Trenton aside to Miss Belton.</p> 
               <p>"That's nothing strange," returned Kate, "she is always rapping somebody over the knuckles-but I don't mind her hits at all; if she was a man, I tell her, she would be either a preacher or a lawyer. She does lecture quite often as it is."</p> 
               <p>"What are you saying about Blanche over there?" asked Susan, smiling.</p> 
               <p>"O I was only saying to Ellen that Blanche was quite in the habit of lecturing, and remarkable for always speaking directly to the point."</p> 
               <p>"And, that if she had been a man, she would have made a preacher or a lawyer," added Miss Trenton.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, and a doctor too I believe," continued Kate; "for she has lately taken to reading dull books on 'Water-cure,' 'Physiology,' and what not; and then she is forever prescribing for me if I complain the least in the world, of being out of sorts. Upon my word, ladies, I shouldn't wonder any day to see a card fastened on our street door, informing the public that medical advice could be obtained within. I expect nothing less."</p> 
               <p>"Now cousin Kate, you are going a little too far," said Blanche good humoredly; "you know very well that you<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC5768-00000118"/> would be frightened out of your senses, if you suspected that I thought of such a thing. So do the ladies, notwithstanding your very serious air and grave face."</p> 
               <p>"Well you can't deny having a taste for all three professions, anyway, can you? and you can't deny wishing with all your heart that ladies could follow them?" answered Kate.</p> 
               <p>"I have heard of ladies who <emph>have</emph> practiced the professions, whether they 'could follow them' or not," said Susan.</p> 
               <p>"So have I!" said Blanche. "The quaker ladies often preach, you know, and some of our sex have studied and practiced medicine successfully. I have read too of a lady, who resided in New York not many years ago, who practiced law in connection with her brother. She did not plead, to be sure, but she was counsellor, and executed many of the legal writings; and was also her brother's adviser in all matters of moment. She was his legal partner in the business, and was generally esteemed the better lawyer of the two; for she was said to be a much closer student, and had a far stronger memory than her brother. So we see it is not utterly impossible for ladies to engage in such pursuits. Still I can deny having myself the <emph>least</emph> desire to figure in any of the professions you have named, Kate, nor was I aware that I had given any occasion for such a supposition."</p> 
               <p>"But you seem to like the professional studies so well," said Kate.</p> 
               <p>"I like the study of medicine, it is true," returned<pb n=""/> Blanche, "but never thought I should fancy the practice. I find ecclesiastical history very interesting-but it does not follow that I wish to enter the sacred desk, for if I thought it a proper place for woman, which I do not, my taste would not lead me there; and as to law, I cannot imagine why any person should suppose I had an inclination that way."</p> 
               <p>"Because, like Nettie, you are so very argumentative, and fond of discussion," said Susan.</p> 
               <p>"And because, like her, you are a very little sarcastic," added Miss Trenton, with some emphasis.</p> 
               <p>"And there is no choking her down, until she has said her say," said Kate; "and yet she can't see why anybody should think her cut out for a lawyer, though she is laying down the law to us all the time. And now ladies, I am going to tell you something that I am knowing to, which will prove that Blanche does fancy <emph>this</emph> profession if no other."</p> 
               <p>"O yes, do tell us!" said the younger Miss Crawford and Miss Edgeway together.</p> 
               <p>"Well, about two weeks ago, she brought home two great books that she had borrowed somewhere, and carried them very secretly to her room. I thought that, notwithstanding she had lectured <emph>me</emph> so much about novel reading, she had procured two monstrous volumes to read herself; so the first opportunity I obtained to look into them was improved, you may be sure;-and what do you think they proved to be?"</p> 
               <p>"Why novels, of course," said Bella Crawford.</p> 
               <p>"No-they turned out to be regular law books; and<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC5768-00000119"/> Blanche would sit up night after night, poring over the dull things, after all the rest of us had gone to bed."</p> 
               <p>"Kate has cornered you nicely now, I should think," said Miss Edgeway. "You must have a pretty decided taste for the law, or you would not do penance after that fashion."</p> 
               <p>"I have been looking into Blackstone and Kent a little, I acknowledge," returned Blanche, "but not with any intention of becoming learned in the law, or from the mere pleasure of reading works of the kind; but simply because I wished to know for myself what the laws were, especially so far as they immediately concern woman."</p> 
               <p>"And what good did you expect to derive from the knowledge?" demanded Miss Crawford the younger.</p> 
               <p>"I meant to assure myself, if possible, of the real position which the laws of the land assign our sex," answered Blanche. "But in truth, I cannot say it has done me any good, if 'where ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly-to be wise;' for I confess I have found the laws regarding woman, to be much worse than I had supposed."</p> 
               <p>"O pshaw! who cares for the laws!" said Flotilla, with an emphatic toss of the head. "I do as I please, and always will too, for all of them; so I don't care a fig what the laws are."</p> 
               <p>"I looked into that part of a lawbook a little, once," said Miss Trenton, "and it soon made me so angry, that I couldn't read another word."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Why, what did it say?" asked Kate and Bella in the same breath.</p> 
               <p>"I read but little," replied Miss Trenton, "yet that little was enough to convince me that the law regarded our sex as but little above the cattle, in point of fact. It absolutely admitted that a man had the <emph>right</emph> to resort to coercive measures, and even <emph>whip</emph> his <emph>wife,</emph> if she did not obey his commands; though, I believe, he has not <emph>special</emph> right to break her bones!"</p> 
               <p>"Outrageous!"</p> 
               <p>"Scandalous!" "Ridiculous!" "I can't believe it!"</p> 
               <p>Such were the responses to this revelation by the various young ladies, uttered in tones of warm indignation.</p> 
               <p>"Miss Rathbone, did you meet with anything of the kind in your researches?" inquired Ellen.</p> 
               <p>"Yes!" answered Blanche, "I found passages to that effect in 'the Common Law.' I presume they were the same as you have alluded to, Ellen."</p> 
               <p>"Is it as bad as Mrs. Trenton has represented?" asked Miss Edgeway.</p> 
               <p>"I cannot unsay a single word that she has said upon the subject," replied Blanche. "I understand the passage to which she refers, as meaning nothing more nor less than she has represented. I have also read nearly the whole of 'Kent's Commentaries,' which you know is a standard authority, and though not as severe upon the sex as 'the common law,' it is quite bad enough. If I rightly interpret what<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC5768-00000120"/> I have read upon this matter, we are, <emph>in law,</emph> but little better than bond-women, if we marry; for a married woman is, legally, nearly as much under the control of her husband, as the southern slave is subject to the will of his master. In fact, every wife is legally a slave, though she may not always be made to feel her bonds, or happily, may be ignorant of their existence. I suppose, however, the married man can hardly be found who would acknowledge this to be really the case."</p> 
               <p>"Nearly all gentlemen say we are much privileged, and that the laws concerning us, were all framed for our protection and benefit," said Susan.</p> 
               <p>"I know this is often said by them," replied Blanche; "but not one of their number, I apprehend, would be willing to be protected or benefited after the same fashion."</p> 
               <p>"The laws <emph>are</emph> for our protection. They are good enough!" said Bella Crawford, decidedly.</p> 
               <p>"What do <emph>you</emph> know about them, pray?" asked Ellen, with a slight sneer.</p> 
               <p>"I know what I've been <emph>told,</emph>" said Bella, "and I should like to have Miss Rathbone show us, if she can, how we are made slaves by the law."</p> 
               <p>"Well then, in the first place," said Blanche, "there is but one period in the life of woman, when she is placed on terms of entire equality with man: that time is, when both are minors, and incapable of holding property. They are then alike under parental jurisdiction, and the parent may bind out the one as well as the other, and may control the disposition<pb n=""/> sition of all their earnings. During <emph>this</emph> period, however, the boy is almost always allowed greater privileges than his sister; but, as the LAW makes no distinction between them, I will let that pass. After the parties reach their majority, the man is free; and the woman, if she remain single, is more independent than she could be in any other condition; but, she is still required to yield obedience to laws that her sex has had no part in making, and which were framed in entire independence of woman's wishes or assent; no matter how intimately they might concern her. If she possesses property, she is compelled to pay taxes equally with the man who has a voice in creating the laws which impose them. There are <emph>many</emph> difficulties surrounding her path, in <emph>single</emph> life, that man is not called upon to encounter, but which he has done much to occasion, and as yet has done little to alleviate: yet still, when compared with her <emph>married</emph> sister, her freedom is like that of a prisoner who is permitted the range of a large house, and extensive, though well-walled grounds, contrasted with his who is limited to the boundary of a narrow cell."</p> 
               <p>"O pshaw! I don't believe <emph>that!</emph>" exclaimed Miss Craw-ford. "Why, anybody would think, that you believed old maids to be better off than married ladies, and that they actually had greater privileges-when the truth is evidently just the contrary. Everybody knows that old maids are considered just the most pitiable creatures in the whole world, if not the most contemptible: I'm sure <emph>I</emph> wouldn't be one-I'd rather die first!"</p> 
               <pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC5768-00000121"/> 
               <p>"So would I!" said Kate. "I wouldn't for the world be one!-everybody despises them, and I among the rest."</p> 
               <p>"If I entertained such views, I should be rather backward, I believe, about expressing them," said Nettie; "lest after all I might happen to become one of the despised ones myself; and this certainly would not be very pleasant, after having done all in my power to convince the world that my remaining unmarried was no fault of my own. But you are quite mistaken ladies: old maids are <emph>not always</emph> regarded with horror and contempt. The strong-minded, or really sensible of either sex, will not find in their condition a reason for the least disrespect: it is only the prejudiced, weak-minded, and vulgar, who affect to sneer, and make this class the subject of their pointless wit; but what need they care for the opinions of <emph>such?</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"About as much as 'the man in the moon' might be expected to care for the buzzing of a fly," said Miss Trenton. "I honestly believe," she continued, with spirit, "that those who sneer at, and ridicule old maids, as they call them, so much, are in nine cases out of ten unworthy to remove the dust from their shoes. But we have interrupted you, Blanche-pray go on; I am anxious to hear more of the law regarding our sex."</p> 
               <p>"I guess we shall have to wait until after tea," said Susan, "as it is in readiness. After supper, we will continue the subject, if agreeable to the ladies, for it is one which concerns us all, and in which I presume all who are present will be interested."</p>

               <p>"NOW Blanche, we are ready to hear what further you have been able to glean concerning the laws," said Susan, soon after the ladies had returned from the supper room to the parlor.</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps some of the ladies present would prefer not hearing anything more on the subject," suggested Miss Rathbone.</p> 
               <p>"O yes! they would like to have you tell us all you know about it, I'm certain," returned Susan; "but if any lady has any objection to offer, we will hear it," she continued, laughing. "Have <emph>you,</emph> Miss Crawford?"</p> 
               <p>"I have no desire for myself to explore the mysteries of the law," responded Bella with dignity; "but if the other ladies wish the subject continued, I shall interpose no objection; for, if the conversation should not interest me, I can abstract my mind, and turn to more romantic and pleasurable themes."</p> 
               <pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC5768-00000122"/> 
               <p>"I don't care anything about it one way or the other!" said Flotilla, in reply to a similar question. "I'd like to know though, well enough, what they <emph>do</emph> say about us; but whatever the laws are, I shall do as I please, for all of them."</p> 
               <p>"I suppose you and your sister, as well as Miss Belton, intend to marry at all hazards," said Susan; and as we, who are not so decided upon that point, feel interested in the subject under discussion, we will conclude that it cannot be less important and interesting to <emph>you.</emph> So Blanche, as there are no objections offered, we are ready to hear from you."</p> 
               <p>"But for mercy sake, don't forget yourself and read us a regular lecture, if you can possibly help it," said Kate. "If you do I shall go to sleep directly. Come Esquire Rathbone, you can begin now, for we shall have to go home some time to-night!"</p> 
               <p>"I have really forgotten where I left off," said Blanche, with a good-humored smile; "can you tell me, cousin Kate?"</p> 
               <p>"You were saying something about single ladies being better off than married ones; which I suppose is one of the 'fictions of law' that you often talk about."</p> 
               <p>"Ah! I remember now," said Blanche. "I asserted that an unmarried lady had far greater <emph>legal</emph> liberty and independence, than her married sister; and this assertion I believe to be no fiction, Kate, but a simple statement of an undeniable truth. A single lady is something in herself: she may buy, and sell, and acquire property; and if she remain single, may hold what is her own, and may dispose of it<pb n=""/> during her life, or will it at her death, as she pleases. She is in fact her own mistress, and, as far as I can learn, the law recognizes her <emph>ability</emph> to transact her own business matters, the same as if a man. But as the law now stands, the moment she marries, she becomes as nothing;-her legal existence as well as her name being lost in her husband's. She can do nothing in her own right; and no matter how much property she may be possessed of at the time of her marriage, it passes directly into the hands of her husband; and the law, in most cases, empowers him '<emph>without her,</emph> to sell, assign, mortgage, or otherwise dispose' of such property at <emph>his</emph> pleasure, and the money obtained by its sale, he may put to his own use."</p> 
               <p>"That can't be the case now," said Elizabeth Edgeway, "for mother owns quite a large farm about ten miles from here, which is to be hers while she lives, and then is to go to my cousin George. I know father can't dispose of that, for he said only the other day, that he wished he could sell it, as he knew of a man who would give a first rate price for it, money down. It has always been rented out on shares, for father can't bear to work himself."</p> 
               <p>"Who has the avails of that farm?" inquired Blanche.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, father!" replied Miss Edgeway, "and a pretty tight hold he keeps on them too, I assure you; though, once in a great while, mother and I manage to get a 'five' out of him, when he has made an uncommon good sale of its produce. He has the handling of all the avails it is true, but <emph>I know</emph>
                  <pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC5768-00000123"/> he can't sell an inch of the land, or he would have done it long ago."</p> 
               <p>"No, in such a case he could not sell it," said Blanche; "for it is only a freehold, and your mother could not have sold it, had she remained single, any more than your father now can; but you perceive, <emph>he</emph> has possession of it in reality, and not your mother. Had it been almost anything else, his power to dispose of it would be unlimited, unless before marriage he had agreed by special contract, to waive such rights; and even in such a case, perhaps, in nine cases out of ten, he could, if he wished, devise some way of rendering his engagement legally null and void. There are many crooks and turns in law, and it is pretty difficult telling when one is secured. The truth is, the law gives a husband almost unlimited power over his wife; while it yields to him every advantage, it affords her only slight protection. Her means of defence are scarcely sufficient to deserve the name."</p> 
               <p>"Now I should think it ought to be just the other way," said Susan, "for man is stronger than woman, and is capable of defending himself should <emph>she</emph> be disposed to insult or abuse him; and, if his home is not pleasant, he can and does spend most of his time elsewhere. It is not so with woman. Therefore, I think that, in simple justice, if man has the making of all the laws, and <emph>we</emph> are expected to obey them, we should be protected by them, both in our persons and property."</p> 
               <p>"The law does not acknowledge that we are a part of the people, therefore I suppose <emph>we are not persons,</emph>" said Ellen;<pb n=""/> for it is a maxim 'that all just government is based on the consent of the governed,' and I'm sure our consent has never been given, or even asked; I have also read something somewhere like this, that in the original Constitution of the State of New York, it was declared, that <emph>no control</emph> or <emph>government</emph> should be exercised over <emph>the people</emph> or <emph>members of the State,</emph> on any pretence whatever, except such as should be derived from, and granted <emph>by them.</emph> So you see, as we have never been consulted in the slightest degree, it is fair to infer that we are neither considered persons nor a part of the people. I believe men now-a-days generally acknowledge that we have souls, though it is evident they think them very small ones. Father was saying to mother the other day, that men generally considered woman incapable of reasoning, in consequence of her very feeble understanding, but that he must own he never saw the man who could penetrate a mystery quicker than she."</p> 
               <p>"O they all acknowledge that we are capable of arriving at correct conclusions, as soon, if not sooner than themselves," said Nettie; "but the majority of them attribute it to instinct or mere animal sagacity, and not to our reasoning powers; and that I consider a far greater insult to our sex than an absolute denial of the fact."</p> 
               <p>"But their thinking so don't make it so, you know," said Susan; "we have that much at least to console us. Ellen's statement that we are not considered <emph>persons</emph> in law, I think on the whole incorrect, though such a conclusion is, to my<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC5768-00000124"/> mind, deducible from the premises; still, if this was the case in truth, I cannot see how we should be allowed to hold property and be taxed for the same, any more than an idiot or a mere animal."</p> 
               <p>"O no, I do not think man meant to be understood as endeavoring to push us <emph>entirely</emph> without the pale of humanity," said Ellen Trenton; "for his own comfort's sake, he should prefer regarding us as human beings and members of society, in theory, at least, and I never really questioned but what this was the case in practice, although I still insist that we have a right to infer otherwise as I have already shown. But I <emph>do</emph> think that he meant to make his sex as important and commanding, and our own as servile and dependent as possible."</p> 
               <p>"No doubt of that!" exclaimed Miss Edgeway; "men wish to keep women under their thumb, from the cradle to the grave; and if one presumes to demur at their self-imposed authority, they lift up their hands in horror, and advise all her sex under their influence, to beware of so anomalous and dangerous a character. Oh, by the way, did you hear how widow Green paid her road-tax last spring?"</p> 
               <p>"No! let us hear it," responded the ladies.</p> 
               <p>Widow Green, it may be well to inform the reader, was the proprietor of a house and lot, which she had purchased since her husband's death, and paid for by her own hard earnings as a washerwoman.</p> 
               <p>"Well," resumed Miss Edgeway, "the widow was waited upon as usual this spring, and 'warned out' as they call it,<pb n=""/> for a day and a half of work upon the road. She told us, at our house, that she had not the money to hire it done as heretofore, and if she had, that she lacked the disposition to apply it in that way, and had accordingly made up her mind to work it out herself if it was done by her means at all. So when the day came she provided herself with a shovel and hoe, and repaired to the appointed place. The men and boys were much amused and astonished to see a woman on the ground, equipped with working utensils, and asked her intentions. She replied that <emph>that</emph> depended upon the path-master; that she had been taxed a day and a half upon the road, and had come to do her duty.</p> 
               <p>"'Better let <emph>Mister</emph> Green drive team,' said one boy.</p> 
               <p>"'No, no,' said another, 'that's too easy for him, better have him plough.'</p> 
               <p>"'Mr. Green or Mrs. Green, whichever you please, young gentlemen,' said the widow tartly, 'is capable of doing either if required.'</p> 
               <p>"Just then the pathmaster approached the widow, who was still holding her working-tools in her hand. 'Good morning,' said the gentleman, 'I saw you were waiting here for something, and concluded you might wish to speak with me. Can I be of any service to you?'</p> 
               <p>"'Certainly, sir,' replied the widow, 'I would like you to assign me my work for the day.'</p> 
               <p>"'Your work, ma'am?' said the overseer, 'how am I to understand you?'</p> 
               <pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC5768-00000125"/> 
               <p>"'Simply that I am here at the appointed time, as I believe the law directs, and ready to perform the service that the law requires of me,' said Mrs. Green.</p> 
               <p>"'But, madam,' returned the perplexed pathmaster, 'the law does not require you to be here in person; you must be aware of that fact.'</p> 
               <p>"'Yes, sir,' answered the widow, 'I know the law <emph>allows</emph> the persons taxed to choose between appearing themselves, supplying a substitute, or paying a fine; now I'm not able to do the two last, so I have come myself.'</p> 
               <p>"The overseer, the widow said, rubbed his forehead and hands, and then his forehead again, and looked wonderfully disturbed. 'Mrs. Green,' said he, after a pause, 'I suppose the law does allow the choice you have mentioned, but it also allows the pathmaster to dismiss such hands as he considers incompetent; and-I'm sorry ma'am, but I can't say I think you competent.'</p> 
               <p>"'Competent for what sir?' asked the widow.</p> 
               <p>"'Competent for working on the road;' he replied.</p> 
               <p>"'And why not, I should like to know,' said the widow.</p> 
               <p>"'Because you are a woman, and have not sufficient strength for such employment,' was the reply.</p> 
               <p>"'I have to stand over the washtub from morning 'till night,' said the widow, 'and strength or no strength, if I can't do as much as any two of those idle boys in a day, you may call me incompetent. As for my being a woman, the law don't excuse me from being taxed on that account-and I<pb n=""/> shall not resign my right of choice, which belongs to me in common with others: so if you please, assign me my task, and I will be at it.'</p> 
               <p>"'Wait a moment,' said the pathmaster, and with that he stepped up to two gentlemen who were standing at a little distance from them. After consulting with them a few moments, he returned, and told the widow that he could not as a gentleman permit her to engage in such employment, and if she would return home, he would see that her tax was paid, without troubling her any further in the matter. So the widow went home, and went about her work as usual. She said she did not expect they would let her stay and work out her tax; but she thought, if they refused to accept her services when offered, they could not compel her either to hire a substitute, or pay a defaulter's fine."</p> 
               <p>"How queer it was, though," remarked Bella Crawford, when Miss Edgeway had concluded; "but it's just like the widow Green for all the world. She used to wash for our folks once in a while, and we used to say, we didn't believe she would be afraid to see the 'old gentleman' himself. Miss Rathbone," she continued, turning to Blanche, "I should like to know whether you approve of the widow's course in this thing; do you think she acted properly for a woman?"</p> 
               <p>"I hardly know what I do think about it," returned Blanche, "but this much I can say: I should not have been willing to be the heroine of her performance, but still I think<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC5768-00000126"/> the affair was very amusing, and I can't say that I am sorry <emph>she</emph> acted precisely as she did, just for once."</p> 
               <p>"As you seem to be undergoing an examination of your principles just now, Blanche, I would like to ask you a question;" said Susan. "Do you think it proper for a woman to interest herself in politics?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly I do," replied Blanche promptly. "Woman is, in her every capacity, as much interested in the welfare of her country as the other sex can be; and if it be badly governed, or its affairs mismanaged, she is as great a sufferer as he."</p> 
               <p>"O you do not understand me," returned Susan quickly. "Of course every intelligent woman must feel an interest in all that concerns the weal or woe of her country,-but what I meant was this: do you not think woman would lose much of her delicacy, and modesty of character, were she to engage <emph>actively</emph> in political affairs?"</p> 
               <p>"Not necessarily," replied Blanche. "Every female sovereign of whom we have read in history, for example, has been obliged from her position to take an active part in the affairs of her realm; and yet I cannot think <emph>this circumstance alone</emph> ever detracted from one of them a whit of her loveliness as a woman."</p> 
               <p>"You will persist in misunderstanding me," said Susan, gaily; "let me put the question in another and more direct form. Do you think we, as a sex, should be granted the right to participate in the administration of governmental<pb n=""/> affairs equally with man? and if that right was given us, do you think it would be proper or expedient to avail ourselves of it?"</p> 
               <p>"Well-in answer to your first question," returned Blanche, "I will say that, though I believe woman to be by nature the equal of man in all intellectual endowments, and that he should acknowledge her as such; and though I believe she is naturally as capable of performing any function of public office as he, and would probably be <emph>quite</emph> as faithful and conscientious in the discharge of all duties pertaining to stations of public trust. Still, I cannot think that woman should be prominent in public affairs to the same extent as man, and this for two reasons. In the first place, though morally and intellectually as well fitted for such occupations as man, she is <emph>physically</emph> far less so: and as there is another important sphere of action, for which she is by nature better qualified than he, and which must be occupied by one or the other sex, I think that both reason and religion require her to act well her part in that province for which it is evident she is <emph>best</emph> fitted, and in which she can accomplish the most real good. Therefore, in this view, it would be both inexpedient and improper for her to engage prominently in political affairs, if the opportunity should be given. This is <emph>my</emph> opinion, and I understand Nettie's views so well upon this subject, that I can safely say it is hers also."</p> 
               <p>"Then what on earth are you complaining about?" said Kate. "I do declare, Blanche, you are a strange thing, if<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC5768-00000127"/> you are my cousin. A minute ago you was 'all up in arms' about the men making all the laws without the consent of the women, and making us out no better than slaves (unless we choose to live and die old maids), and you were going on at such a rate that anybody would suppose you wanted to go straight to the polls and vote, and perhaps be president yourself; but now, lo! you have turned clear around, and say it's 'neither expedient nor proper for woman to engage in political matters.' Upon my word, I don't know what to make of you."</p> 
               <p>"You have expressed, Kate, precisely what I was thinking myself," said Bella.</p> 
               <p>"I see that you are ready to exclaim, 'consistency thou art a jewel!'" said Blanche, pleasantly, "but I think I can reconcile the apparent contradiction, if you will listen to me for a moment. It is true I have joined in complaining of some of the laws, and have also expressed the opinion that governmental affairs should be principally conducted by men; but while I have acknowledged this, I have not said that their power has never been abused, or that we who are the sufferers by such abuse, have no right to complain. Our sex is, and ought to be considered, an integrant portion of the community, as important as their own, and equally entitled with them to 'life, <emph>liberty,</emph> and the pursuit of happiness;' and while the one governs in the political, the other should rule in the domestic world. Man, in making laws that concern our sex, should so legislate that we can assent to his enactments without feeling that our freedom is abridged, or that<pb n=""/> our happiness and real interest are considered secondary and inferior to his own. Woman, in her turn, should do all in her power to promote the happiness and prosperity of man. There should be no unnecessary interference of one party antagonist to the other; but both should feel that while they have each a different sphere to fill, their objects and interests are identical, and can only be successfully harmonized and promoted when the sexes are placed upon equal ground, and each is willing to be influenced and advised by the other: while neither should feel that because their employments and pursuits are dissimilar, the one is to be held inferior in importance or true dignity to the other.</p> 
               <p>"But you are well aware, ladies," continued Blanche, "that such a state of society does not exist. The majority of the other sex look upon our own as a lower order of beings, who are incapable of thinking and acting for ourselves; and therefore, in the fulness of their generosity, they have undertaken to think and act for us."</p> 
               <p>"And without so much as asking if it would be 'agr'able,' as our Betty would say," added Miss Trenton. "But it is married ladies who are treated worst," she continued; "and I told father this very morning that I never intended to marry, on account of the laws, but he said that an effort was now making, that if successful, would greatly benefit them, as it would enable married ladies to hold property in their own right. I had heard nothing of this before, and thought father just said it perhaps, to put me out of the<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC5768-00000128"/> notion of remaining single. Have any of you ladies heard anything of the kind?"</p> 
               <p>"I have," responded Miss Edgeway. "I heard something about it last night, though not much to be sure. But I guess it's true though, for father seemed quite stirred up about it, and said the women were well enough off now."</p> 
               <p>"I believe there are <emph>some</emph> men who truly feel that we are deprived of some of our chiefest rights," said Nettie, "and who would gladly see us in the enjoyment of privileges corresponding with their own; men who look upon our sex with honor and respect, as well as admiration, and who would cordially second any effort to improve our position; yes, who are actually laboring for that purpose now."</p> 
               <p>"I also believe there are such men," returned Blanche, "but at present they are too few to accomplish much for our <emph>general</emph> benefit, however much they may desire it. Still I am deeply grateful to them for their efforts and wishes, and earnestly hope they may have the satisfaction of seeing them at last crowned with success. It is a noble work, and whether successful or otherwise, I wish them every happiness in this world and the world to come."</p> 
               <p>"O how sentimental you are becoming Blanche," said Bella; "but you haven't told us yet <emph>all</emph> about the married ladies. You have only given the dark side; now, suppose the husband <emph>does</emph> take his wife's property, he is obliged to support her, is he not? And if she is left a widow, she has her thirds, does she not?"</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"<emph>Obliged</emph> to support her-yes!" answered Ellen, without waiting for Blanche to reply; "and in just the manner he may see fit-himself being judge and jury to decide upon what is needful. Now, for instance, were you or myself to marry, and did we possess, no matter how much money, all that we did not previously expend in furniture and such things, would go into the hands of our husbands; and then, perhaps, if we wished to purchase a pair of gloves or a handkerchief, we should have to argue the point by the hour, before we could get what little 'change' we wanted to procure them with."</p> 
               <p>"I wouldn't ask my husband at all," said Bella. "I would go to the shops and get whatever I wanted, and have them charged to <emph>him,</emph> and he might pay for them; for a man is obliged to pay his wife's debts if she lives with him."</p> 
               <p>"Not always," said Blanche; "for he can deny if he pleases, that such and such articles were <emph>necessary,</emph> and declare them beyond his ability to afford; then, if the salesman cannot prove to the contrary, he is liable to lose the debt. So you see, Bella, a married woman's credit even on her husband's account, is not past questioning; however, such a case as I have mentioned, I suppose to be very rare, for most men would be too proud to pursue such a course, unless the wife's account was really extravagant, and even then, only the smallest of the species would avail himself of such a right."</p> 
               <p>"But a pretty storm they might see fit to raise at home if their wives should trade a shilling's worth on their account,<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC5768-00000129"/> without their consent," said Ellen; "and there are plenty of that class of gentlemen too in the world, besides those who are <emph>called</emph> close and stingy. Depend upon it, there is many a so-called 'good fellow' who smokes his three or four cigars a day, and treats himself and friends to oysters and hot coffee of an evening (if not anything stronger), who will preach to his wife by the hour about economy; and if she wants a shilling or two, <emph>he</emph> has no shillings to spare-there are too many ways for <emph>his</emph> shillings already. Should she get what she requires and have it charged to him at the store, without his consent or knowledge, there is a furious breeze when he does make the discovery. As for her getting 'her thirds,' I think her chances generally pretty slim, for in nine cases out of ten, the wife dies before her husband; and should she survive him, she is not by any means then sure of getting them, is she Blanche?"</p> 
               <p>"Not at all," answered Miss Rathbone; "for at the time of her husband's death, there may be little or nothing left to make a dowry for the widow out of. If there had been property, it may have been lost or squandered, through the mismanagement, extravagance, or intemperance of its holder; or he may have been unfortunate in business, and in order to satisfy creditors, may have been obliged to give up nearly everything he possessed; or, he may have taken a fancy to sell or mortgage his estate, and so have persuaded or tormented his wife into signing away her right of dower. As the laws now are, although a woman may be worth her<pb n=""/> thousands on her marriage-day, she is by no means certain (if it should go into the hands of her husband) that a few years will not find her utterly destitute, and toiling with the needle for her own, and perhaps a family's scanty support. I wish I could say that <emph>such</emph> cases very rarely occurred, but I am constrained to believe they are far too frequent. But, suppose a widow succeeds in obtaining her dower," continued Blanche, "it amounts to nothing more than a freehold for life; for if I have read the law aright on this subject, she cannot by sale convert it into money, however important or desirable it may be to her to do so. She cannot even direct who shall inherit it upon her decease; and if mines are discovered upon her estate in dower, subsequent to her husband's death, she is prevented from opening and working them for her benefit, as by so doing she would render herself liable to an action for waste, whenever the prospective heir or heirs should see fit to prosecute her for such an offence. So you perceive that after all she cannot even control her dowry as her own property."</p> 
               <p>"But her husband can will her as much as he pleases, can he not?" asked Miss Edgeway.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, <emph>if</emph> he pleases," answered Blanche, "but the <emph>law</emph> does not <emph>require</emph> him to allow her one farthing aside from 'her thirds,' and if she accepts anything from her husband by will, she is obliged to resign her claim to dower. And then how many husbands there are, who die intestate."</p> 
               <p>"But suppose," said Miss Edgeway, "you should be worth<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC5768-00000130"/> ten or fifteen thousand dollars, and should marry a man tomorrow who is worth nothing: suppose he has all the avails of your property to use in his business, and finally dies without leaving any will, or any family but yourself; would you in that case have only a third of the property remaining?"</p> 
               <p>"If my property was in what is termed real estate, I suppose, on my husband's death, in the case mentioned," answered Blanche, "it would return to me again; but if it was in money or chattels, I cannot see that I could recover a cent; and, unless my husband died possessed of real estate of his own, from which I could claim my thirds, I should be left penniless; for, dower only attaches to real estate, and where there is no will, a wife can only claim her dower."</p> 
               <p>"But to whom would belong what was left if there was no real estate? or if there should be, whose would be the remaining two-thirds if not the widow's?" inquired Susan.</p> 
               <p>"My husband's parents if living, and if not, his next nearest kin," was the reply. "A husband, it is true," continued Miss Rathbone, "may during his life-time make his wife a gift, which she can hold and use for her own sole benefit, if at the time the gift was made the husband was sufficiently free from debt. But in this country, such gifts are not common, though permissible; so that unless by antenuptial contract, a woman secures to herself the control and possession of a sum sufficient to insure a degree of independence, she is rendered by law as dependent upon her husband's will for the daily comforts of life, as the babe is by nature dependent upon its mother for care and nourishment; though<pb n=""/> without possessing a tithe of the child's security against neglect or abuse."</p> 
               <p>"Well I declare, the laws are perfectly outrageous, to say the least!" exclaimed Miss Edgeway. "Free country indeed-with every wife in the land enslaved! I cannot see," she continued "that a married woman is <emph>legally</emph> one whit better off as regards <emph>true</emph> liberty, than any slave; the situation of a hired servant is far preferable in that respect to hers,-don't you think so, Ellen?"</p> 
               <p>"Decidedly!" responded Miss Trenton; "for a man often wishes to control his <emph>wife</emph> in matters beyond his own province, and the law gives him the power to do it. The only exception is the matter of dowry; I believe he has no power to compel her to alienate her right to <emph>that,</emph> although law or no law, he often does it, and then induces or forces her to perjure herself by swearing all was done of her own free will. I have seen husbands lord it right pompously over their better halves, or at least try hard to do so, by not only seeking to control them in every expenditure, and deciding for them in matters of dress and household arrangements, and even in their choice of friends; but by commanding them around like brutes, and endeavoring to trammel their very thoughts. Such treatment cannot be inflicted upon a hired servant, for not one could be found who would submit to the tyranny. Servants too, can leave their employers if not pleased with their treatment; but the poor wife must endure <emph>her</emph> wrongs in silence, or her griefs become blazoned through the community, and subject her to a thousand ill-natured<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC5768-00000131"/> slanders from which she would recoil with horror. She cannot look to the law for redress unless the case be one of the grossest outrage, for the law permits, if it does not directly sanction such abuses on the part of the husband. It makes my very blood boil when I think of the insults that married ladies are often obliged to bear from those who have promised better things."</p> 
               <p>"Well Ellen, such cases as you have mentioned, are not very many, after all," said Susan. "I have known of some in my life, it is true, but these extremes are I think rarely to be found; indeed most married women appear happy and contented. And, as a general rule, I imagine husbands treat their wives with respect and attention, and are often wholly influenced in their affairs by their advice; and I may add, sometimes to their hurt too, for we know there are many artful and vicious women in the world who lead their husband's sad lives. No, no, Ellen, all men are not of the disposition you have described."</p> 
               <p>"I should hope not!" exclaimed Miss Trenton. "If I thought they were all alike, I shouldn't want to stay in the same world with them long. I suppose there are many excellent husbands who do both love and respect their wives, and as a <emph>general</emph> thing, treat them with every kindness and affection; but still, the <emph>power</emph> is in their hands to do otherwise, and I honestly believe that by far the greater number, in one way or another, seek to exercise it, as you would find out if their wives would but unseal their lips on the subject. Their <emph>appearing</emph> happy and contented, I look upon as no certain<pb n=""/> tain sign that they are so, for most women have pride enough to conceal their domestic infelicity from the world as much as possible, and to make the very best of a bad bargain. You say, Susan," she continued, "that there are many bad wives, but in my view, the wonder is that there are not more; for the degrading position which they often occupy under the household roof, where there should be equality of title if anywhere, and the insult that is offered to their understanding by the voice of the law;-these are enough to rouse every rebellious feeling into action; especially when they discover that a display of temper, like the sting of a wasp, constitutes their only defence against abuse. I acknowledge there are a few artful women, who deceive their husbands upon every opportunity, but such almost invariably have either tyrannical or miserly husbands, and are obliged to resort to stratagem as the only means of securing their objects: and, where interests are so unequal, it can't be expected that they will entertain many conscientious scruples about the propriety of outwitting their would be lords and masters, provided they have the power."</p> 
               <p>"I have settled in my mind how I shall outwit <emph>my</emph> husband," said Kate. "You see my property, that I'm to have, will be pretty much all in money, and I don't mean my husband shall have it. I shall buy any quantity of rich clothing, and have it all made up before I'm married, and the rest I'll lay out in silver plate, and house and table linen, and have everything marked with my name, 'Kate Belton,' in full: then nobody would buy, if he should take a notion to sell them."</p> 
               <pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC5768-00000132"/> 
               <p>"Then, after all you have heard, you mean to marry-do you Kate?" asked Ellen.</p> 
               <p>"Mercy-yes!" answered Kate. "Mother would near about kill me, if I undertook to be an old maid. She don't know much about the laws, you see, and if she did it wouldn't make any difference that I know of. She says the men can't rule the women anyway, unless they have a mind to let them, for she says she believes with the poet, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>'If a woman will she will, you may depend on't,</l> 
                        <l>And if she won't, she won't, so there's an end on't;</l> 
                     </lg>
                  </q> and that if we are only cunning enough, we can have our own way, either by 'hook or crook;' only, we mustn't let them know we dream of such a thing on any account, until after we are married. As for me, I'll risk but what I can manage my husband somehow when I get him."</p> 
               <p>"I should not wish to <emph>manage</emph> my husband, if ever I married," said Nettie, "any more than I would wish him to attempt to manage me. I believe it to be the duty of both husband and wife to repose the fullest confidence in each other, to exercise mutual forbearance for mutual failings, and in short, each do in all things as each would be done by: governed by such rules of action, the most perfect harmony and happiness would prevail in their domestic life, provided, of course, the marriage be one, originally, of affection."</p> 
               <p>"I didn't suppose <emph>you</emph> thought of such a thing as marrying at all," said Kate.</p> 
               <p>"I do not think much of it; I do not <emph>now</emph> think I shall<pb n=""/> ever marry," returned Nettie; "but if I <emph>should</emph> do such a thing, I should wish to be united to a man whom I could love and honor, and who would look upon me as a companion and an equal: by such a man I would be cheerfully <emph>influenced,</emph> as far as my own sense of right would allow, nor consider myself humbled by so doing; neither would such a man feel that he was losing a particle of true dignity by yielding in like measure to the influences of his wife. But I would not marry a man, Kate, whom I supposed I could <emph>govern</emph> if I wished, any sooner than I would knowingly give myself to one, who in becoming my husband, would also wish and expect to become my governor."</p> 
               <p>"I agree with you perfectly," said Blanche.</p> 
               <p>"Of course-" muttered Ellen to herself.</p> 
               <p>"I believe," continued Blanche, "that the marriages most productive of true happiness, are those in which the parties approach nearest to circumstances of equality. We cannot, of course, expect that a couple can be in reality placed in equal position while the laws remain as they are, and we cannot hope for a very speedy change in our favor; yet, the man is not obliged to feel or display that superiority over his wife which the laws authorize him to claim, nor is he obliged to believe in or defend their justice or utility. While, as I have said, the laws of the land make a wife but little better than the slave of her husband, <emph>he</emph> is not obliged to make her <emph>feel</emph> the chain; but on the contrary, is able to increase her happiness, and lessen her sense of dependence, without violating any statute, just or unjust; and this, if he feel towards<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC5768-00000133"/> her as he should, he would endeavor to do. Neither party should feel at liberty to act with entire independence or disregard of the other, but each should consult the true interest and happiness of their partner, and hold them identical with their own. The husband ought also to exert himself to elevate and improve the general condition of our sex, and this not only for the sake of his oppressed sisters, but for his own sake as a man. Her education, though in some respects different, should be equal to his own, and this would make her more useful and agreeable to him as a companion, as well as tend to fit her for the better performance of the duties usually devolving upon her as the instructor of childhood and youth."</p> 
               <p>"But then," said Nettie, "if she is to remain in a state of continual vassalage, it is perhaps no mercy to open wide the gates of knowledge for her; for chains that press lightly upon the ignorant, would bury deep into the heart-flesh of the cultivated and refined. I do sincerely hope that efforts <emph>are</emph> being made to improve the laws regarding our sex, and pray that these efforts may be abundantly successful."</p> 
               <p>"You were speaking, Blanche," said Susan, "of a husband and wife's living together on terms of perfect equality; do you mean to be understood that it is <emph>never</emph> the duty of a wife to yield her wishes to those of her husband?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly not," answered Blanche; "I simply mean that the yielding must not be wholly on one side, and the authority on the other; but that both must occasionally make concessions, if either would be happy."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"O yes; but in a matter of dispute, how would you decide which should surrender the point?"</p> 
               <p>"Very easily I think," replied Blanche. "If a difference of opinion existed upon a subject interesting to both, but more immediately concerning the husband, because more especially connected with his duties as a man, or upon which he had larger experience, and better opportunities for information than his wife; it would unquestionably be her duty to yield her opinion, and any truly sensible woman would do so, even though her judgment remained unconvinced of the correctness of his conclusions. On the other hand, if the matter related more intimately to the wife's sphere of action, and concerning which she should be presumed to be better acquainted, the husband ought to resign the point to her. To express a determined will upon any question of difference, is I think wrong, and calculated to do evil if indulged in by husband or wife. It serves only to stir up anger, and to make each feel that concession would compromise their own self-respect, and demean them in the eyes of the other. But where a husband shows by occasional and proper concessions to his wife, that he holds her opinion in respect, and values her judgment; she will naturally in return become not only willing, but anxious to repay his consideration by yielding to his views and wishes. In matters of mere abstract opinion, involving no action on either side, I think they should agree to disagree. Now is not my theory good?"</p> 
               <p>"Good or bad, it is mine!" said Nettie.</p> 
               <pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC5768-00000134"/> 
               <p>"And mine also," responded Susan, and one or two other ladies in the company.</p> 
               <p>"It isn't mine!" exclaimed Bella Crawford. "Man <emph>is</emph> the superior of woman! He knows more than she does-is smarter and more noble looking: now Miss Carrol, honestly, don't you think man is the superior?"</p> 
               <p>"He is undoubtedly woman's superior in some respects, but she is sufficiently above him in others, to strike the balance," replied Nettie. "I presume," she continued, "there are many of both sexes who are a disgrace to the species; indeed, I know of examples, but I would not judge all by those."</p> 
               <p>"Well, when I take upon myself matrimonial vows, and pledge my faith at the altar," exclaimed Bella, with a sudden burst of romantic fervor, "I shall resign my hand to a man whom I can look up to, and who will govern me."</p> 
               <p>"And <emph>I</emph> hope you will carry him all the property you can get hold of, and have a nice time wearing the yoke," said Ellen, tartly. "I think, after all," she added, "there <emph>are some</emph> girls in the world who need to be governed by a husband-and you are one of them.</p> 
               <p>"Didn't you tell me the other day," continued Miss Trenton, turning to Blanche, "that if a man married a woman who was in debt, the payment of those debts could be enforced upon the husband?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I said the law would compel him to pay, if he had property, and no other provision had been made for their liquidation: but that law, I presume, was made in consideration<pb n=""/> tion of the husband's coming into possession of his wife's property. I look upon it however as unjust, and hurtful to both parties; for if the debt was unknown to the husband at the time of marriage, what abundant material would it furnish for taunts and persecutions if he were so disposed, and the probability is that they would not be spared, even though the wife should bring to his estate tenfold more than the sum of the debt. Again, if the wife were penniless, it would seem hard to exact the payment of such debts from the unfortunate husband, and I trust with other unjust laws this also will soon be repealed."</p> 
               <p>"There is another law which is harder upon the men, than any you have named as so oppressive to us," said Bella. "A gentleman lately told me, that if a wife stole anything or committed any public offence, the husband would be punished for the crime, while she would go free. What think you of that, Miss Rathbone?"</p> 
               <p>"I think as I always have done, that it is a law which clearly proves (if proof were wanting) the legalized oppression of the married woman."</p> 
               <p>"Why, how do you make that out?" asked Bella quickly.</p> 
               <p>"I will tell you," replied Blanche. "I suppose when this law was enacted, the barbarous custom of imprisoning for debt prevailed; and as a wife could no more contract a debt against herself than a minor, from the fact that she could hold no property, and was consequently without personal credit; and as she was supposed to be restricted in her expenditures, which as I said before could exceed necessaries<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC5768-00000135"/> for herself and family only at the salesman's risk, except by her husband's permission; it would hardly look well to thrust her into jail for what was, after all, her husband's debt; therefore, if her husband refused or was unable to cancel it, he was imprisoned, and she was left to take charge of her family as usual; but, when the law went so far as to punish a man for the theft of his wife, if committed in his presence or with his knowledge, on the ground of supposed coercion, it declared in plain terms that the wife was so helpless an instrument in the husband's hands, that she could be forced into the commission of actual crime at his will; and by holding her blameless for her supposed obedience, acknowledges her to be utterly defenceless against the most unreasonable and iniquitous demands of her husband. Does this not show that she is held by the statute to be as powerless as the horse which is governed by bit and bridle? And yet, men say we are so much better off than we have been in past ages, that we have no reason for complaint, but ought rather to be thankful to them for removing any portion of our burthens."</p> 
               <p>"And so, because we were wronged in past ages, when men themselves were steeped in barbarism, they must continue to oppress us," exclaimed Ellen; "and we must not murmur, but be thankful because they are not <emph>quite</emph> as cruel and merciless as their savage forefathers! On the same ground," she continued, "one man ought to consider himself under exceeding obligation to another who is larger and stronger than he, for suffering him to pass the streets without taking forcible possession of his goods or assaulting his person."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"And because robbers and assassins have existed in past times, we might as well say that a person now-a-days would have no right to complain if he <emph>was</emph> robbed and only <emph>half</emph>-killed; but should rather be grateful that he was not murdered outright," added Blanche. "I believe indeed that we ought to be thankful to Heaven for any change in our favor," she continued, "but all that man would be entitled to from us, <emph>as man,</emph> should our condition be greatly elevated and improved, would be forgiveness for the past, and a just appreciation of his motives and efforts in behalf of our sex. Now we know that in ancient Rome a <emph>son</emph> was a slave to his father, during the father's life, no matter what his own age might be, and the same was true of other nations; but, who ever considered that fact a sufficient reason for continuing the wrong. Man will not be oppressed; <emph>he will</emph> shake off <emph>his</emph> chains or die in the attempt; and yet he it is who rivets them so tightly upon his more feeble sister; and because for his own sake as well as hers, he has loosened them a little in late years, he strives to cheat himself into the belief that he is entitled to her life-long gratitude, and that any murmur upon her part is in the highest degree ungrateful and absurd; and he would therefore condemn her to perpetual silence."</p> 
               <p>"I want to ask you one question, Blanche," said Flotilla, "and I wish you to answer it if you are able. Why didn't man, or Adam, eat the apple?"</p> 
               <p>"He did eat the apple."</p> 
               <p>"No-you are mistaken," returned Flotilla.</p> 
               <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC5768-00000136"/> 
               <p>"Why yes!" exclaimed Miss Champell, "didn't you know that?"</p> 
               <p>"Flo'lla, I'm astonished!" said Bella, "certainly it is said that he ate of the apple."</p> 
               <p>"Then why are people always talking about the <emph>woman's</emph> eating the apple, as if Adam did not touch it?"</p> 
               <p>"Because Eve was the leading person of the two, and so was the first to partake," said Kate. "Adam ate afterwards."</p> 
               <p>"But if the man was not the most intelligent, why did he hold out the longest without sinning?" asked Bella.</p> 
               <p>"Because he was tempted <emph>last!</emph>" said Miss Edgeway. "He <emph>did</emph> sin at the moment of temptation. He had no earlier opportunity."</p> 
               <p>"But why did Satan tempt first the woman? why did he not attempt to try Adam first, if he believed that he could deceive him?" persisted Bella.</p> 
               <p>"It's probable he thought that if he could only get the woman to eat, it would be a certain victory over both," said Miss Edgeway.</p> 
               <p>"I presume Satan was on the whole a skilful general," said Susan, "and knew what course to pursue to accomplish his mission. He calculated as certainly upon the man's partaking of the fruit as upon the woman's; but to gain <emph>her,</emph> it was necessary to avoid startling her conscience, or giving her time for reflection, by allowing her to witness her husband's disobedience before she had been tempted from the path of duty. The devil was attacking the strongest point, when he assailed Eve, else why did he leave in triumph, as<pb n=""/> if all was accomplished when her hand had plucked the fruit?"</p> 
               <p>"He was perfectly satisfied that Eve's influence would be all-sufficient to render the fall of Adam complete," said Ellen.</p> 
               <p>"And what does that prove?" asked Bella, triumphantly, "excepting what the men say, that the woman was more artful and worse than Satan himself?"</p> 
               <p>"Men say that because it took the embodiment of all deceit to deceive the woman, and they do not like to think it required less to deceive <emph>them;</emph> but the idea is as wicked as it is absurd. How could the woman who had committed but one sin, and had been deceived into that, be more artful than the Father of lies?"</p> 
               <p>"But, Ellen, the man was not deceived. Don't you know the minister read last Sunday that the woman was deceived, and the man was not? I happened to hear that much, and I remember it."</p> 
               <p>"Well, what does that prove?" replied Blanche, for Ellen had turned inquiringly to her, "nothing, except that the man was utterly without excuse; for woman, it may be pleaded, was deceived into transgression, but man sinned with his eyes open. I have often thought of the manner in which Eve was tempted, and have never needed anything further to convince me that woman is not by nature man's inferior in intellect. Satan did not in his argument appeal to her physical appetite, but to her higher faculties, her love of knowledge; for said he, 'in the day ye eat thereof your eyes<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC5768-00000137"/> shall be opened, and ye shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.' And so Eve ate, and unlike man in his selfishness, she wished her husband to participate in her knowledge, and gave to Adam, who ate also. We have no reason whatever to suppose from the Scripture narration, that she urged Adam, or that he manifested the slightest reluctance to partake with her of the forbidden fruit. But I guess it is quite time we had brought our debate to a close," she added, glancing at the clock, "I had no idea it was so late."</p> 
               <p>"Mercy on us! it's ten o'clock," exclaimed Ellen, springing to her feet, "I did not think of spending more than an hour of the evening, at the longest, when I came."</p> 
               <p>"I didn't expect to spend any part of it," said Bella, "for I had another engagement, which I declare I had entirely forgotten until this moment. I don't think, Susan, you can complain of not having had a visit from us this time."</p> 
               <p>"I am certainly very much obliged to you all, ladies," replied Susan; "I have enjoyed the visit exceedingly. I am sorry I have no beau to offer you but my father," she added, "but as you all go in the same direction, I imagine he will be able to escort you safely home without difficulty."</p>

               <p>WEEKS glided away. Spring was merging into summer, and the vale that sweetly embosomed the picturesque village of Elville, was smiling in vernal loveliness. The little pond, or lake as it was called, never sparkled more brightly in the sunbeam; and its willow-skirted margin never waved more enchantingly beautiful than now. The crystal waters of the brook that meandered through the village, never danced more merrily along their pebbly bed, nor had the groves and gardens ever echoed sweeter music than now gushed from a thousand tiny throats on every side, while the air wafted abroad the delicate aroma of many a fragrant shrub and flower. So thought, at least, those of the inhabitants of Elville who were so blessed as to possess a love for the beautiful in nature, and whose hearts the sunshine of happiness kept still lighted up with genial warmth and cheerfulness. The tender grass already covered the grave of Elva Lee, and the daisies planted there by the hand of affection, bloomed freshly from amid their verdant beds. The oak and the<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC5768-00000138"/> chestnut interlaced their boughs high above the place where she slept; and Charlie fancied that the birds, as they perched upon the branches, or drooped their wings to drink the dews from the new grass and odorous flowers surrounding his sister's grave, carolled more softly and sweetly than was their wont.</p> 
               <p>Poor Charlie! The first violent burst of sorrow had passed away, only to be succeeded by the profoundest melancholy, and an apathetic indifference to every external object, but the spot where his sister was buried. The sunshine had no charm for him, save only as it fell upon that hallowed spot; and the music of birds or the blossoming of flowers was unregarded, save as they warbled over or blossomed near Elva's tomb. No tear had been seen in his eye since the cold earth had covered his loved sister's form, but each day his cheek grew paler, and his figure more attenuated. His friends, who had become seriously alarmed upon his account, had contrived various expedients to occupy or divert his mind; but as yet every effort had proved unavailing. They had proposed visits to distant relatives, or journeyings to the sea-shore for the benefit of his health; but he insisted that he was perfectly well, and consequently needed not the sea air, and that he felt no inclination to visit. Still his parents and Dr. Milford were persuaded that nothing but change of place and scene, would prevent him from soon following his idolized sister to the grave; and, with the hope of arousing his dormant energies, and inducing him to go abroad, they now resolved to resort to stratagem.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>Accordingly, one morning, just after Dr. Lee had been complaining in the presence of his son (as indeed he had of late frequently done) of indisposition, Charlie was privately summoned into his father's office by Dr. Milford, who then requested the favor of an interview, to which Charlie assented. After looking around as if to assure himself that they were entirely alone, the Doctor cautiously closed the door and turned the key. This movement, as it was intended, awakened Charlie's curiosity, and as the Doctor seated himself again at his side, he looked up with an expression of interest upon his face, such as it had not before worn since his sister's death.</p> 
               <p>After much seeming hesitation, the Doctor inquired if he had observed how gloomy his father was becoming, and how very unwell he had appeared for several days previous.</p> 
               <p>Charlie looked up with evident alarm and surprise, and replied, that though he had heard his father complain somewhat, he had been so stupid as not to observe the change of which his friend had spoken; and he anxiously inquired to what cause he thought it attributable.</p> 
               <p>"His health I think is suffering from anxiety of mind," answered the Doctor. "Pecuniary embarrassments are exceedingly perplexing; and to a man of his years-"</p> 
               <p>"What can you mean?" interrupted Charlie, springing to his feet and as quickly reseating himself; "my father cannot be perplexed with embarrassments of such a nature."</p> 
               <p>"The most prudent are not exempt from misfortune, Charlie," replied the Doctor, gravely.</p> 
               <pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC5768-00000139"/> 
               <p>"Can it be possible, Doctor, that my father is suffering from such a cause?" answered Charlie, with increased feeling; "while I, his only son-his only child now-am doing nothing to assist him, but am passing my time in idleness: why have I not been informed of this before? I might have done <emph>something</emph> to relieve him, or at least have made the effort, instead of hanging a useless burthen upon his hands. Why, Doctor Milford, <emph>why</emph> did you not tell me before?"</p> 
               <p>"We did not think it would be well to harrass you with these matters unless it became imperative, or until it became apparent that the threatened evil could not be easily averted; we have often spoken of informing you, but your father could not bear to break to you the unpleasant intelligence, and I have refrained from doing so until now, although your father gave me permission to speak with you upon the subject some two days ago."</p> 
               <p>"Pecuniary embarrassments-threatened evil that cannot easily be averted;" repeated Charlie Lee; "what has occasioned this embarrassment, Doctor? what is the evil which you dread? and is there any hope of our being able to avert it now?"</p> 
               <p>"To commence with your first question," returned the Doctor; "your father has suffered a very severe loss, which he could by no possibility have prevented. Of this I have not leisure to go into particulars now, nor did he give me liberty at present to do so: but he is now fearful of being obliged to bear another equally heavy misfortune, which he says, if not prevented, will nearly ruin him. This fear it is,<pb n=""/> which has occasioned the gloom, and evident ill health of which I have spoken. There is a <emph>possibility</emph> of preventing the loss now threatened; but Charlie, if prevented at all, it must be through your instrumentality. Your father is too feeble to take the journey required, or to attend to the management of such business as will be necessary if this loss is to be prevented; and yet he does not like to call upon you."</p> 
               <p>"My poor father!" exclaimed Charlie, "why should he hesitate to call upon me? Who should he call upon, if not his son? In pity, Doctor, be more explicit; what loss does he apprehend, and how can a journey be necessary to avert it?"</p> 
               <p>"I suppose," said the Doctor in reply, "you have imagined that this home of yours, and your father's large farm, were entirely unincumbered?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly-I have never heard to the contrary."</p> 
               <p>"Then it is my unpleasant duty to inform you," replied the Doctor, "that a gentleman in Elville now holds a mortgage upon the entire property, the term of which will expire in about six months. I cannot now tell you <emph>how</emph> this happened, but I suppose it is sufficient for us to know that it is so. A man is always liable to losses, as I before remarked, and a physician cannot always collect his dues when most needed. It would be useless, therefore, for your father to depend on them alone, in such an emergency as the present. The plan we propose, and hope most from is this: your father has a claim upon some very valuable property in the State of Ohio. But this claim has been disputed, consequently he cannot take possession without first establishing<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC5768-00000140"/> his title by legal action. The lawyers with whom he has consulted, inform him that there will be little if any difficulty in the way of his recovery, and advise his taking immediate steps for the purpose. He has been in correspondence with an attorney in Cleveland upon the subject, who thinks that his personal attendance will not be necessary, providing some trusty person can be engaged to act in his place to whom he could entrust the papers referring to the matter now in his possession, and who could collect such remaining proof as may be found necessary. It may be essential for some one to go to Detroit to obtain the testimony of an aged aunt of your father's, who, it is supposed, resides there as formerly, if living, though your father has not heard from her for several years. If she can be found, she can furnish ample proof of the justice of the claim. As the property in question is very valuable and easily convertible into money, your father is anxious to have the business attended to immediately, so that, if successful, he can apply the proceeds of its sale to cancel the mortgage when it shall become due. Now your father and myself both think, that it would not be well to place the affair in the hands of a stranger who had no direct or immediate interest in a favorable termination of the action, or in economising the expenses of a prosecution; therefore from this and other considerations, we unite in concluding that you are by far the most suitable person with whom to confide the whole business, provided you are willing to undertake it."</p> 
               <p>"I am willing to do all and everything in my power,"<pb n=""/> said Charlie, who had listened with earnest attention to the Doctor's details; "I trust that neither yourself nor my father would doubt it for a moment. How soon would it be desirable for me to enter upon this mission?"</p> 
               <p>"As soon as possible," answered the Doctor; "<emph>I</emph> think the sooner the better."</p> 
               <p>"Well then, I will be ready to set out on Monday, which will give me two days for preparation before the Sabbath, for leaving home. Will that be early enough, Doctor?"</p> 
               <p>"I think so," was the reply; "but we can tell better after consulting with your father."</p> 
               <p>With this understanding, the interview closed, and they left the apartment.</p> 
               <p>Now the reader must not suppose that this story of Dr. Milford's was entirely an invention of his own or of Dr. Lee's, for neither of these gentlemen would be guilty of imposing a really false statement upon young Lee, even though so great a good as that restoration to himself which they so earnestly desired, would be certain to result from such a proceeding. But that Charlie was nevertheless deceived in the matter, and only such portions of the truth were told him as were calculated to produce the desired effect upon his mind, is certainly true. His father and mother, with Dr. Milford, had spent some time in arranging this plan, to induce a belief, on the part of Charlie, that his agency was invoked from reasons of overwhelming necessity; and yet to make to him no statement that was not in itself abstractly true. A careful observation of the ambiguous language employed by<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC5768-00000141"/> the Doctor in his conversation with Charlie, will show that he did not assert that Dr. Lee was suffering from ill health and anxiety of mind in consequence of <emph>pecuniary embarrassments,</emph> but his allusion applied equally to the loss which his father had sustained in the death of his daughter, and his present anxiety on account of his son; while Charlie was designedly misled as to its true meaning. To assert that the Lee property was <emph>legally</emph> under mortgage, would also be an untrue statement. When Drs. Lee and Milford had decided that in order to accomplish their object it would be necessary to resort to stratagem, and had determined upon their plan, Dr. Milford placed all his ready money, books, &amp;c., into Dr. Lee's possession, and in return received from him a mortgage on his whole estate, duly signed and sealed, but as it was not either witnessed or recorded, it was of course, as was intended, legally null and void. The statement regarding the property in Ohio was substantially correct. Dr. Lee had quite recently heard of the death of a distant relative, who had died without leaving any will, or any nearer of kin than himself. One other person only, bore the same degree of consanguinity to the deceased, and consequently the property would legally be divided between them. This other heir, however, in order, if possible, to secure the whole estate to himself, denied that the Doctor's relationship was as near as his own, believing that Dr. Lee would be unable to furnish proof to the contrary. But in this he was mistaken; for the Doctor had already ample testimony in his possession to substantiate his claim, even without the evidence of the aunt before mentioned;<pb n=""/> but as it would afford a pretext for keeping his son longer away, besides extending his journey, it was resolved to attach much importance to the testimony of this aunt upon the subject in question.</p> 
               <p>Whatever scruples Dr. Lee's family might have entertained as to the propriety of the course they had adopted, they had abundant reason to be satisfied with its effect upon Charlie; for he now seemed to be fully aroused from the apathy he had so long displayed, and appeared thoroughly conscious of the responsibility devolving upon him. It was finally arranged that he should set out on his journey on the Tuesday following; and the preparation that was necessary for an absence that might extend to months, occupied so much of his time as to leave him little leisure for the indulgence of grief.</p> 
               <p>Still the dear departed sister was not, and could not be forgotten. Many a volume that had been hers, and many a little keepsake which she had given him, were carefully packed away in his trunk, to the exclusion of favorite authors and other articles of his own.</p> 
               <p>A little before sunset of the evening preceding his departure, Charlie turned his steps towards the sacred enclosure, to pay a farewell visit to his sister's grave. The shaded nook wherein the tomb of Elva was embowered, could not be seen from the path he had chosen, until close upon it; and he was not aware that others were there before him, until he found himself in the presence of Nettie and Blanche, who had been twining and arranging flower-wreaths upon the<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC5768-00000142"/> marble slabs that marked the head and foot of the grave. Both Charlie and the ladies started as they recognized each other; and Blanche, knowing Nettie's strong influence over Charlie in other days, and hoping she might now succeed in diverting him from his dangerous melancholy, took up her basket of flowers and rambled to another grave, visible at some little distance from them. Nettie attempted to follow her, but the voice of Charlie, scarcely audible, breathing her name, arrested her footsteps.</p> 
               <p>"I am <emph>very</emph> thankful to you both, for your kindness to me," he said, after a moment's hesitation; "those flowers are beautiful, and Elva loved them so much. Do you know, Nettie," he continued, "that I am here for the last time for many weeks, and maybe months?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Charlie: Doctor Milford informed me," replied Nettie; "and Blanche and myself, knowing you would be here to-night, wished to render this holy spot, so endeared to you and to us, as lovely as possible. While you are absent from it, Blanche and I will watch over it; we will water the flowers and train the rose-trees you have planted, that upon your return you shall find no traces of neglect to awaken so bitter pangs for the memory of your departed sister."</p> 
               <p>"May Heaven bless you both!" exclaimed the young man, fervently,-and passionately stretching out his hand towards her as he spoke; while tears which he endeavored in vain to suppress overflowed from his eyes. Nettie unhesitatingly placed her hand in his, and without appearing to observe his emotion, she said,-</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"I must leave you now, Charlie; but before we say good-bye, will you not promise me to endeavor to look upon this heavy loss,-which you have such blessed reasons for believing is your sister's gain,-in the light that reason and religion alike demand? It is the hand of God that has been laid heavily upon us, and though this dispensation be afflictive to us, it is undoubtedly merciful to her. Let us then bow in humble resignation to His will, 'who doeth all things well,' and strive so to live that we may hope to join her in Heaven, and that our death may be as peaceful as was hers. It is wrong, Charlie; it is wrong to give ourselves up to unavailing sorrow: but I must go now: will you promise me, Charlie?"</p> 
               <p>"I <emph>will</emph> endeavor, Nettie, to profit by your advice," answered the young man, after a pause. "I <emph>will</emph> strive not to look upon myself as alone in the world; not to forget that Heaven has still spared me rich blessings in the continued life and affection of my parents; in the inestimable friendship of yourself and Blanche; and the brotherly regard of Doctor Milford. But let us join Blanche," he continued, as Nettie made a motion to depart, "I cannot suffer her to leave without saying adieu: you will tell her for me, how grateful I am to her for her kindness?"</p> 
               <p>"I will!" answered Nettie.</p> 
               <p>"I had designed calling upon you both for a few moments to-night," said he, soon after they had joined Blanche; "but as I shall be obliged to leave about daybreak to-morrow, and have still some arrangements to complete, I will here bid you good-bye."</p>

               <p>THE sun had not yet wholly disappeared when the young ladies left the cemetery grounds, and as the evening was uncommonly fine, they concluded to visit the cottage of the widow before returning home. They found Mrs. Merton and her family in comfortable health, and very glad to see them both; but particularly pleased, as the widow expressed herself, to see Miss Nettie looking quite well again. Through the instrumentality of Nettie and Dr. Lee's family, Mrs. Merton was now constantly supplied with work, and appeared to be in the enjoyment of every necessary comfort.</p> 
               <p>After making a much longer call than they had intended, they bade the widow good evening, and set out on their return home. The last glow of daylight had nearly faded from the horizon, but the moon had rose high in the heavens, and was now shining brightly upon their way. Fearlessly, the young girls pursued their walk, conversing upon various topics<pb n=""/> ics of interest; when, suddenly reaching an abrupt turn in the road, they distinctly saw the figure of a man, reclining against the trunk of a tree not many rods in advance of them. As the face of the person was turned from them, they knew they were not yet observed by him, and stepping back a few paces, so as to prevent discovery, should he cast his eyes in that direction, they consulted together in a low voice upon the most judicious course for them to pursue. They feared to proceed, for they were yet at quite a distance from the more frequented thoroughfares of the village; and they did not like to return to the cottage, for they had now left it far behind, and there were no intermediate dwellings.</p> 
               <p>"What shall we do?" said Blanche. "<emph>I</emph> can see no way but for us to return to Mrs. Merton's as quickly as possible."</p> 
               <p>"But should we do so," returned Nettie, "we should have the same distance again to go over to-night, and in all probability, unaccompanied. It would not answer for us to remain all night you know, as our friends would not know where we were, and would be alarmed about our safety."</p> 
               <p>"Hark!" whispered Blanche. "I hear footsteps. He must be moving."</p> 
               <p>"But not this way;" returned Nettie, after listening in breathless silence for an instant. "I can hear them distinctly, but they are not approaching us."</p> 
               <p>The young ladies taking courage then stepped forward, sufficiently to get another view of the road. The man had indeed quitted his post beneath the tree, and to their surprise, was hurrying towards a female figure that was rapidly<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC5768-00000144"/> approaching him. The cordial manner of their greetings, convinced the young ladies that they had witnessed a lover's meeting, and that it was preconcerted, and of a clandestine character, they readily inferred; for the lady, as she accepted the proffered arm of her companion, looked back as if fearful of pursuit; and instead of seeking the more usual promenades, the couple appeared perfectly satisfied to explore the lonely road they were now upon. They soon became so completely absorbed in the society of each other, that they did not observe Nettie and Blanche, who had decided that it would now be perfectly safe for them to continue their homeward walk; and were accordingly proceeding on their way, until they were quite near the lovers, though not sufficiently so for either couple to identify the other. The lady appeared first to observe them, and gave the gentleman a rather sudden jerk, which was immediately followed by his slouching his hat over his eyes, and upon her part by the transfer of a large, thick veil, from her arm to her head, in such a manner as to perfectly conceal her features and neck.</p> 
               <p>"That couple are wonderfully afraid we shall learn who they are," said Blanche. "Let us go quite near them as we pass; from what I have heard for a day or two past, I think it very likely they may prove to be acquaintances of ours. So let us keep a sharp look out.</p> 
               <p>"The gentleman certainly resembles Mr. Sanford, in figure at least; and I believe it is him, too," she added, as the approach of both parties brought them a few paces nearer; "who <emph>can</emph> the lady be?"</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Hush! I can call her name," whispered Blanche.</p> 
               <p>"Good evening, Miss Crawford," she exclaimed aloud, as they were about passing the masqueraders.</p> 
               <p>"The lady started but made no answer, while the gentleman in an assumed voice replied, "Mistaken in the person, ma'am," and they passed on.</p> 
               <p>"That certainly looked like Bella Crawford's shawl," said Nettie, when they had left the mysterious couple some distance behind them; "and the figure resembles her's too."</p> 
               <p>"It <emph>was</emph> Bella Crawford, figure, shawl, dress and all; and no one but her," returned Blanche.</p> 
               <p>"But why did you speak to her, when you saw her anxiety to avoid recognition?" asked Nettie.</p> 
               <p>"Because," said Blanche, "it was only this morning that she positively denied that he either visited or waited upon her at all, now-a-days. You know it has been for some time past reported, that they were engaged."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I have heard such reports frequently, but I seldom give much credence to mere village rumor, which is oftener false than true, as you and I ought to know by this time; for madame Rumor has reported us both positively engaged at least a dozen times each, and yet we have neither of us, as far as I know, registered the first vow to man. Besides, I have recently heard the report concerning Bella contradicted."</p> 
               <p>"I suppose you have heard how it originated, have you not?" asked Blanche.</p> 
               <p>"No, I have not," replied Nettie.</p> 
               <pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC5768-00000145"/> 
               <p>"Well, it was in this way," said Blanche. "Flotilla told several young ladies, among whom were cousin Kate and myself, that Mr. Sanford had declared to her, that he feared he should be obliged to keep out of society altogether; as her sister Arabella's beauty had so captivated him, that unless he exiled himself entirely from her presence, he should certainly be obliged to surrender. That he thought Arabella the most angelic creature he had ever beheld. 'But,' Flotilla said, 'instead of avoiding her sister, he took great pains to seek her presence, and seemed more and more pleased, or rather charmed, with her every day.' And then, about a week after that, Mrs. Crawford enlightened Mrs. Edgeway and Mrs. Trenton by the information, that she 'expected nothing else' but that they 'would have to have a wedding' at their house; for Mr. Sanford was '<emph>dreadfully</emph> in love' with her Bella; and that Bella herself thought him the 'handsomest man she ever saw, and the intelligentest;' and that 'Bella was a judge about such things.' This was several weeks ago; but, since Mr. Sanford's star has gone down in Elville, and nearly everybody who knows anything about him has become completely disgusted with his conversation and conduct, there has been a great change in the tone of the whole family, except Bella, who has, until very recently, continued to defend him. Some one who took an interest in Bella, and thought it too shocking that she should sacrifice herself to such a creature, called upon her mother, and told her in a friendly manner how Mr. Sanford was now regarded by Elville people. Mrs. Crawford at first insisted that the<pb n=""/> charges concerning him were fabricated by the young ladies of the village, who were jealous of her daughter, and had wished 'to catch Mr. Sanford for themselves,' as she said. But when she became convinced, as she did soon after, that he was in reality looked upon as a contemptible coxcomb; that he was habitually profane, even when in 'genteel society;' that he possessed an ungovernable temper, which manifested itself upon the slightest provocation, regardless of time or place; that he was also addicted to gambling; and, worse than all, that his wife, whoever she might be, would be far more blamed or pitied than envied; she resolved to inform Mr. Crawford of what she had learned, and request him to forbid the gentleman's future visits, and he was denied the house accordingly. Since that time the family, save Bella only, have stoutly denied the truth of the reports which had obtained such active circulation respecting Miss Crawford and her lover; and now, Bella herself has joined her friends in asserting that there never had been anything warmer than mere friendship between them, and that she now heartily despises him.</p> 
               <p>"But Mr. Beesley told Kate," continued Blanche, "that he was quite confident the lovers continued to meet, though privately; and that he knew that they were certainly engaged. This morning Bella called at aunt's, and began to tease Kate about Mr. Beesley, who you know has been quite attentive to her of late.</p> 
               <p>" 'They say,' said she to Kate, 'you are to be married to him, but I don't believe it; for you don't have trouble<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC5768-00000146"/> enough. If you are, I shall say it's no love match, for you know the course of true love never did run smooth."</p> 
               <p>"Kate laughed, and said in reply, 'From what you have just said, Bella, and from what I hear, you and Mr. Sanford mean to marry each other after all.'</p> 
               <p>"'No we don't!' replied Bella; 'I wouldn't have him for the world. He would find it rather unhealthy to come near our house now; he'd get as much as <emph>one</emph> flea in his ear, I reckon.'</p> 
               <p>"'But romantic young ladies sometimes meet their lovers away from home, do they not?' I asked.</p> 
               <p>"'I have read of such things, and heard of them too,' she answered; 'and I think it's proper enough when the parties are under the influence of a true and tender affection; but <emph>I</emph> wouldn't go an inch from home to meet a man that I despised as I do that Sanford.'</p> 
               <p>"I thought, Nettie, that under these circumstances, it would do her no harm to let her see that we recognized them to-night; especially as they could not well avoid knowing us, unveiled as we were, and the moon shining full in our faces when we passed them.</p> 
               <p>"What a pity it is those Crawford girls have no more principle," continued Blanche after a brief pause; "they have not the least regard for truth it would seem; for whenever it will serve their purpose in any way to utter a falsehood, it is done without apparent hesitation. I cannot help believing they would have been very different girls, had they been blessed with such a mother as yours, Nettie."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"I have no doubt of it," said Nettie. "I believe a mother has, generally speaking, more power and influence in the formation and direction of the character of her children, than any other human being; but alas! how many of them abuse that sacred trust, or are in reality unconscious of its extent. I have often thought of the Crawford girls; and while I censure, I also pity them, and I really cannot bear to think of Bella's marrying this Mr. Sanford."</p> 
               <p>"She will marry him, I presume," returned Blanche, "for he can talk just enough about novels, and look sufficiently foreign, to suit her taste. Besides, he would probably be willing to woo her upon his knees, after the most approved manner of old-fashioned novels, and that I suppose she would consider almost indispensable in a lover. Elizabeth Edgeway says that Bella refused a friend of hers who had become charmed with her beauty, and fancied that if removed from her mother's influence she might become a pattern woman,-simply because he, taking her to be a more sensible girl than she was, seated himself by her side, and in plain sensible terms, asked her to be his wife; instead of sighing, and pining, and dangling about her for a fortnight or so, and at length flinging himself at her feet and imploring her mercy. Elizabeth says she has no question but what if he had been of a more romantic disposition he would have been accepted; indeed, Bella told her afterwards that he was the most matter-of-fact sort of person she ever saw, and that that thing alone completely spoiled him for <emph>her</emph> fancy. She had no idea such a 'handsome man' could be so 'horrid prosy and dull.'"</p> 
               <pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC5768-00000147"/> 
               <p>"If she marries Sanford," returned Nettie, "she will soon find the ardent and romantic lover metamorphosed into the most tyrannical of husbands. I do hope she can be induced by somebody to give him up; though I must own, if any young lady in Elville deserves such a husband, it is her. I presume, as you say, she will marry him, for she has such an uncontrollable aversion to old maids that she would hardly dare refuse a second offer-especially if it should come in the approved manner-lest she should have no other. Oh, Blanche, when I think of those girls as they are, contrasted with what they might have been, I feel that I cannot be too thankful for the good influences that have ever surrounded me at home! But for that, I might have been as they are, and perhaps in greater danger of a worse fate."</p> 
               <p>"No, Nettie, not with <emph>your</emph> disposition could I imagine it possible: but, after all, in such a case your disposition might have been different. Who can fathom the immeasurable breadth and depth of a mother's influence, and a mother's example! Your mother has been as a mother to me; the only one I have ever known. But for her I am certain I should never have been what I am. How different a world, Nettie, would this earth of ours have been were all mothers like your's! How much purer-how much happier!"</p> 
               <p>"I have no doubt of it, Blanche; still, I am not disposed to lay the <emph>whole</emph> charge of a child's misconduct at its mother's door: for, if gifted with reason and common sense by nature, and old enough to use it, the child is answerable I think, in part at least, for its own deviations from morality and virtue.<pb n=""/> When I think, Blanche, of the manner in which many of our young ladies spend their time; of the objects for which they live; and the foolish nonsense which supplies the material for most of their conversation;-I do not wonder so much that men, judging us by such specimens, should think and speak disparagingly of our sex, as they usually do."</p> 
               <p>"But they have no right to judge all by such examples," said Blanche. "I know that many of our young ladies at the present day," she continued, "prove, by their conversation and conduct, that they consider the attainment of frivolous accomplishments far more important than the less showy but more useful branches of education; and that dress, fashion, and fashionable amusements-with beaux, and a genteel or wealthy matrimonial connection in perspective, make up the grand desideratum, for which they seem only to exist. But because such things are, men have not the right to assert that woman is capable of nothing higher or better; for with but a single example of acknowledged wisdom, knowledge and pre-eminent mental strength among the sex, instead of the thousands who have in all ages distinguished themselves and adorned the pages of history;-it would be ample proof that the true reason for whatever inferiority may exist, is not attributable to the lower mental nature of woman, but must be chargeable to some other cause."</p> 
               <p>"Mother thinks the reason why so many young ladies of the present day are of the description we have mentioned," said Nettie, "is because they are not properly disciplined during childhood; but are suffered to grow up not only in<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC5768-00000148"/> entire ignorance of nearly every domestic employment, but are allowed to pass the greater portion of their time in indolence, or the unrestrained indulgence of such fancies and caprices as may happen to please them best; and to imbibe, unrebuked, the ridiculous notion that domestic pursuits, or any <emph>really</emph> useful employment, is degrading to a lady of gentility or taste. She says, if mothers generally would see that their daughters formed habits of industry and self-reliance in early youth, and were suitably educated for the important stations they might be called upon in after-life to fill, there would not long be so many helpless and weak-minded young maidens, or so many ignorant and inefficient wives. And this I believe to be true."</p> 
               <p>"So do I," responded Blanche; "and I think also, that if men generally, would treat our sex more as rational and intelligent beings; if they would themselves look for, and expect more from us, and show by their conduct that the society of the intelligent and refined was in <emph>reality</emph> most highly appreciated by them; they would soon find the vainest and most frivolous of our sex anxious for improvement, and cultivating a higher standard of excellence. It is true, there are many females, who in spite of every obstacle, do attain to great mental superiority; but as a general rule, woman needs appreciation and encouragement, in order to much improvement. She must not be told that she <emph>cannot</emph> accomplish this or that; but that she <emph>can,</emph> and may do very much if she only will."</p> 
               <p>"Man seldom does this," said Nettie; "what can women<pb n=""/> do? is the common sneer with him; while he pours streams of flattery into the ears of every good-looking young lady he meets; and if from politeness, or because really pleased, she does not evince disapprobation, he complains of her vanity. He will listen sometimes, by the hour, to the nonsensical prattle of some weak-minded, but pretty-faced girl; and convince her of her power by appearing perfectly captivated with her nonsense, and by addressing to her conversation even more silly than her own; and then go away to prate of woman's want of sense, and her intellectual inferiority to man: and yet the very men who are most fond of making these inuendoes, are the ones who shun the society of those of our sex who are understood to be more than ordinarily sensible and intellectual; thus plainly proving that such society is not congenial to their tastes."</p> 
               <p>"I have frequently been made quite ashamed of the conduct of some young ladies," said Blanche; "and have blushed for the honor of my sex: still, as I said before, man has no right to pronounce judgment upon us <emph>all,</emph> on account of the follies or weaknesses, which he has either directly or indirectly encouraged in, or assisted to fasten upon us, whenever the opportunity has been his.</p> 
               <p>"What if some of us <emph>are</emph> vain, and weak, and frivolous," continued Miss Rathbone; "need we go out of any circle of society in which such may be found, to discover at least an equal number of the other sex with whom to compare them, and that not unfavorably to ourselves?"</p> 
               <p>"I think not," answered Nettie; "for, for every vain<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC5768-00000149"/> woman in Elville, I could easily point out an equally vain man, and I presume the same is true of other places."</p> 
               <p>"And for every <emph>weak minded</emph> woman, a companion from the other sex could quite as readily be found," said Blanche; "for what is it <emph>less</emph> than weakness, to allow one's self to become a perfect slave to a noxious and disgusting weed! to bow the knee to Bacchus, and yet acknowledge it a voluntary act! (for nearly all protest that they have power to free themselves at any moment,) and who is it but man, that is principally guilty in these particulars! and yet the very men who, but for the guidance of some friendly hand, would often witlessly make their beds in the gutter, and whose very pastimes are low or vicious in their nature, presume to cry out upon <emph>our weakness</emph> and mental inferiority as a sex, because some of our number are guilty of leading the comparatively innocent life of a butterfly.</p> 
               <p>"Man, would not think it right for us to judge of their entire sex, by such specimens as I have mentioned," continued Blanche; "and I confess it would be exceedingly unjust so to do; but if we <emph>were</emph> to pursue such a course, we should have far greater reason to think and speak contemptuously of them than they of us."</p> 
               <p>"Ah! you think if we were to judge of both sexes by the worst specimens that could be produced from either, our sex would suffer the least?" remarked Nettie.</p> 
               <p>"Exactly," returned Blanche.</p> 
               <p>"And yet," said Miss Carrol, "it is frequently asserted<pb n=""/> that an abandoned woman is far worse than a vicious man can be; do you believe <emph>that,</emph> Blanche?"</p> 
               <p>"I believe she is, <emph>outwardly,</emph> more degraded than man; but that such is the case, I consider no proof that she is worse at heart; the apparent difference between them, I attribute entirely to the dissimilitude of the circumstances surrounding them. <emph>Man,</emph> we know, may be guilty of vice to almost any extent; and yet he is not, in consequence, excluded from all virtuous companionship, for, as a man of business, he <emph>must</emph> mingle occasionally with the good and honorable of his own sex: this, neither he or they can well avoid. And then, through fear of wounding some respected female friend, who is so unfortunate as to stand to him in the relation of mother, wife, or sister, or for some less plausible reason, he is frequently invited into circles where he meets with the refined and amiable of our own sex, by some of whom (for the sake of his friends) he is simply tolerated, and by others (without the shadow of an excuse) treated with as much respect and attention as though possessed of an unblemished character: consequently, he is obliged to observe a certain propriety of manner at least, when in such society; and then, he knows that 'Man may tarnish his name and brighten it again,' if he chooses; therefore he never looks upon himself as wholly lost. But with woman it is not so; one false step, if known, almost invariably excludes her forever from all respectable society,-shuts the door to all reputable employment, and often drives her from friends and from a father's house into the unfriendly streets; and thus, the poor victim feels herself<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC5768-00000150"/> compelled to continue a course of life, from which her whole nature may shrink with loathing."</p> 
               <p>"I believe it is often so," said Nettie, sadly. "A fallen woman knows that no repentance, or reform, on <emph>her</emph> part, however heart-felt or sincere, will restore her to the place she has lost, or to anything like respectability; therefore, she has little, or no <emph>earthly</emph> inducement, to endeavor to become other than she is."</p> 
               <p>"She feels that she is lost for time, and the poor creature dare not <emph>think</emph> of eternity," added Blanche. "She associates only with the degraded of her own, and the vicious of the other sex; and it were strange, indeed, if under <emph>such</emph> circumstances she did not become in reality more abandoned than man. Oh Nettie, Nettie! how my heart swells when I think of these things, if man is indeed so much stronger-minded than woman, why is not his punishment proportionally greater, instead of being far less than hers? and oh! Nettie, are we, as women, wholly guiltless in this matter? do we not sadly err, in shutting our doors so closely against the deceived and misguided ones of our own sex, and in suffering them to go down to their unhonored graves without an effort on our part to restore them to virtue, and to save from eternal death their immortal souls; and yet receive hardened and unrepentant man within the sanctum of home, and if disposed to return to the path of rectitude, to bestow upon him that encouragement and friendship which is too generally withheld from the returning ones of our own sex?"</p> 
               <p>"I have often thought of these things, Blanche," returned<pb n=""/> Nettie, "and ever with sorrow. We certainly are <emph>not</emph> guiltless in this matter; we are far too much under the dominion of custom; and through fear of giving offence, or of appearing singular, we, as a sex, do that for which our consciences must condemn us: 'Things ought not so to be'"</p> 
               <p>The young ladies, who had walked very slowly, after entering the more frequented part of the town, had now reached Mrs. Belton's residence, and as it was rather late, Nettie allowed Blanche and Mrs. Belton's servants to accompany her home.</p>

               <p>THE family clock was striking eleven, when Bella reached home. After softly closing the street door and securing it, the young lady removed her shoes, and taking them in her hand, proceeded noiselessly up the front staircase, and from thence to her sleeping apartment. Flotilla was in bed and fast asleep when she entered, but awoke as she laid herself by her side.</p> 
               <p>"Ah! Bella, where have you been?" she asked, "what time is it?"</p> 
               <p>"Hush, Flo'lla!" don't speak so loud," whispered Bella, "and I will tell you all about it. It's not late though. How<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC5768-00000151"/> long have you been in bed? and where did mother think I was?"</p> 
               <p>"I came to bed a little after ten," replied Flotilla; "and mother said you told her you and Kate Belton were going to run down to Esquire Edgeway's a little while, but shouldn't be gone long. Father was very much worried when it got to be ten o'clock, and you had not returned; he told mother he shouldn't wonder at all if you hadn't been near Edgeway's, or Mrs. Belton's either; but was tramping off with that San-ford somewhere. When he said <emph>that,</emph> ma' was for having him go right down to Edgeway's, to see if you were there or not, and she would have <emph>gone too,</emph> if it hadn't been for me, I can tell you <emph>that,</emph> and <emph>then you'd</emph> have been in a pretty fix I take it. You see, I told them that you had undoubtedly found company either at Mrs. Belton's or Esquire Edgeway's, and had been persuaded to stay the evening; that ten o'clock was very early to come home from any evening visit this time o'year, and that, as for your meeting Sanford, there was no earthly danger of it, for the Edgeway girls couldn't bear the sight of him, and that they needn't be afraid of your meeting him purposely, anyway; for, that you told him plainly, the last time you saw him, that you didn't want him to trouble you with his company any more, for you would quicker hang yourself than marry him.</p> 
               <p>"And I told them too," continued Flotilla, "that I had heard you tell a great many of the girls, since then, that you perfectly despised and abominated him-and you know <emph>that</emph> is true."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Yes, yes, Flo'lla, but what did our folks say?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, mother said, she hoped it <emph>was</emph> as I had said, and that she had much rather you would fancy Mr. Beesley, for <emph>he</emph> stood high in Elville; but Sanford had completely run himself out, and that nobody <emph>now</emph> believed a word about his being rich. Then father said, that if he ever set foot in <emph>his</emph> house again, he believed he would kick him out, and that he wouldn't care if somebody blew his brains out (if the fellow really had any brains). Father had been complaining of a pain in his eyes all the evening, so I told him I thought he had better go to bed; and mother too, and that I would sit up for you, that you would probably be home soon. So after a little, father went to bed, and mother, because I had said something about my having the headache, wouldn't hear a word to my sitting up for you, but declared that she couldn't sleep a wink anyway, till you did come home, and so she should wait for you herself. I thought Bella, all the while, that you were with Sanford, somewhere, and would get found out, if father undertook to look for you, so I managed my cards as well as I could."</p> 
               <p>"You are a dear good sister, Flo'lla, and I'll tell you all about it. You see, I received a note from Mr. Sanford, a little after noon, requesting me to meet him this evening near the oak tree on the lake road, between eight and nine o'clock. Of course, I couldn't <emph>start</emph> from home so late alone, so I made up my mind to go to Mrs. Belton's and stay half an hour or so with Kate, and tell mother that Kate and I were going to Esquire Edgeway's; and as I didn't expect to be out<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC5768-00000152"/> so late, I thought she would think I was there, and not be worried about me.</p> 
               <p>"Mercy on us! what a good thing it was, Flo'll, that you kept pa' at home to-night; I should have got found out, as true as <emph>guns,</emph> if you hadn't. If you'd been at home before I started for Mrs. Belton's, I should have told you all about it, but you couldn't have done any better if you had known the whole. And now I'm going to tell you what Mr. Sanford says about <emph>you;</emph> he says you are the most charming little creature he ever saw; that you are handsome and witty, and that if he hadn't fallen in love with me first, he certainly should be obliged to yield up his heart to <emph>you.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"I don't believe he said so, Bell; you're just trying to flatter me, that's all."</p> 
               <p>"No, Flo'll, upon my word I'm not; he <emph>did</emph> say so, every word of it, I could take my oath on it; and he says too, that if you will help us to contrive a little, and will keep our secrets for us, he will send to New York and buy you such a silk dress as will make all the Elville girls stare; and that when we are once married, and pa' and ma' get reconciled, he'll take you to New York, and all around with us. He's <emph>rich</emph> Flo'lla, as rich as a <emph>Jew,</emph> (I don't care <emph>who</emph> says to the contrary.) and he is not one that will think anything too good for his wife to wear.</p> 
               <p>"Poor man," continued Bella, "he has been slandered and abused here shamefully, and it's all out of envy, I <emph>know that,</emph> and because he has been accustomed to better society than the most to be had here, and sometimes shows it a little<pb n=""/> in his manners (I declare I think Elville is a downright mean place); he feels bad about it, about their slandering him so, but says if anybody wants to know what <emph>he</emph> is, let them go to New York or Albany, where he is well known, and they will find out that he is <emph>quite</emph> as respectable as anybody in <emph>Elville.</emph> I declare, I think-Flo'lla, are you asleep?"</p> 
               <p>"No, no-I'm wide awake, go on."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I was going to say that poor Sanford and I are called upon to suffer about as much persecution for each other's sake as almost any hero and heroine of whom we have read; but if it only ends well, I sha'n't care, for the course of <emph>true</emph> love never did run smooth. I rather like the excitement too."</p> 
               <p>"When are you to see him again, Bell?"</p> 
               <p>"Not for two or three days; but I'm to write to him <emph>every</emph> day, and he is to send me notes by Kate; I am to get everything ready for a sudden move, and am to let him know by Wednesday evening, if possible, when I shall be ready to become his own forever-hark! what noise is that?"</p> 
               <p>"It's mother, coming up stairs," whispered Flotilla; "she thinks you are out yet-we must both be fast asleep-don't <emph>you</emph> speak."</p> 
               <p>When the door was opened, not a sound was heard in the little room, except the deep and regular breathing of Flotilla, and the more subdued respirations of Bella. Mrs. Crawford did not advance far into the apartment, or loose her hold of the door-knob, but clung to it, almost as if for support.</p> 
               <pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC5768-00000153"/> 
               <p>"Flotilla! Flotilla!" she exclaimed, in a deeply anxious voice, "Flotilla! are you asleep?"</p> 
               <p>"M-a'-am-did anybody speak to me?" said Flotilla, in drawling tones, partly raising herself in bed, and rubbing her eyes as she spoke.</p> 
               <p>"Is it you, ma'-what is the matter?"</p> 
               <p>"Where do you suppose that child is?" said Mrs. Craw-ford. "It is almost twelve o'clock, and she ha'n't come <emph>yet.</emph> I'm almost distracted!" and the tones of the mother's voice testified to the truth of her words.</p> 
               <p>"Why mother, she's abed here and fast asleep; she came right off after <emph>I</emph> come up to bed. She and I thought you heard her when she came up stairs, and must hear us talking, so we didn't go down to let you know she had come."</p> 
               <p>The mother heaved a deep sigh, as if relieved of a great burthen.</p> 
               <p>"I wish you <emph>had</emph> come down to tell me she had got back," she said, "for it would have saved me nearly two hours watching and worry. Where has she been?"</p> 
               <p>"At Mrs. Belton's," Flotilla replied; "and as a company came in while she was there, Kate made her stop the evening, just as I told you she would."</p> 
               <p>"Then she didn't go to Esquire Edgeway's at all?"</p> 
               <p>"No, ma'am."</p> 
               <p>"Now <emph>this</emph> is what <emph>I</emph> call getting out of a scrape pretty well," said Flotilla, laughingly to Bella, as soon as Mrs. Crawford's retreating footsteps were no longer heard.</p> 
               <p>"<emph>First rate,</emph>" returned her sister.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"But why did you tell mother I hadn't been to Esquire Edgeway's?"</p> 
               <p>"Because," answered Flotilla, "Mrs. Edgeway and the girls come here quite often you know, and just as like as any way, some of them will call to-morrow; and then, mother you see might say something about your spending this evening with them; then of course they would look surprised, and deny your having been there, unless you gave them the wink beforehand, which you might not get a chance to do, and wouldn't exactly like to, if you should; but Kate is already in your confidence, and we could manage her easily enough, if she should call; as for her mother, I don't think there is much danger of her bringing you out, if she had a chance; besides, she don't come here very often now."</p> 
               <p>"Well I <emph>do</emph> believe you are smarter than I am, sis," returned Bella; "I will own <emph>that;</emph> and when I am indissolubly united to my Edward, I will buy you a beautiful gold necklace like mine."</p> 
               <p>"You needn't <emph>give</emph> me anything, to <emph>pay</emph> me for helping you," said Flotilla; "for <emph>maybe</emph> I shall want you to pay me back in the same coin some day; however, I should like such a necklace first rate, and now that I am out, I think I ought to have one as well as you. I think it's real mean in pa, that <emph>he</emph> hasn't bought me one long ago. When do you and San-ford think of getting married?"</p> 
               <p>"We shall unite our destinies as soon as possible, but cannot yet decide upon <emph>the day;</emph> but when we do, I shall let <emph>you</emph> know, of course. But Flo'lla, I'm dreadfully afraid it<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC5768-00000154"/> will get out that I met him to-night; for, as he and I were walking arm-in-arm, on the lake road, who should we see coming from the opposite direction to us, but two ladies. I flung my veil over my head in double quick time, and Mr. Sanford pulled his hat as much over his face as he could, and we both thought that if they <emph>were</emph> acquaintances of ours, they wouldn't know us. Well-before they were very near us Mr. Sanford told me they were Nettie Carrol and Blanche Rathbone, (<emph>I</emph> couldn't see very well through my veil.) Now I wouldn't have met either of those girls, just then, for anything, and I was <emph>so</emph> in hopes that they wouldn't know me: but I expect they did, for Blanche addressed me by name as we passed each other, and though I did not answer her, and Mr. Sanford assured her she was mistaken in the person, I'm afraid she was pretty certain it was me. Now Flo'lla, what shall I do?"</p> 
               <p>"'Tis a bad affair," replied Flotilla, gravely. "She <emph>must</emph> have known you, Bella, or she never would have spoken to you, and your not answering made it plain enough that you felt guilty. I wonder what business <emph>they</emph> had on such a lonely street, at such a time of night; you can ask them <emph>that</emph> if they say anything."</p> 
               <p>"But what good would it do? besides it was <emph>not</emph> very late, it was only a little after dark. How would it do to let Blanche into the secret, too? I think she would keep it."</p> 
               <p>"I don't know <emph>that,</emph>" returned Flotilla. "Blanche might take the opportunity of revenging herself on you, for the part she always thought you took in that Academy affair."</p> 
               <p>"O she's forgotten <emph>that</emph> long ago; besides, I always denied<pb n=""/> nied having had anything to do with it, and as she can't <emph>prove</emph> that I had, it would be foolish in her to lay that up against me now; it wouldn't be like her either, for she <emph>can't</emph> hold a grudge any time at all, if she wants to. I had a good deal rather not tell her though, if we can think of anything better to do; for it was only this morning that I run Sanford down, before her, like everything, and pretended I couldn't endure him, and did not see him at all now-a-days. I wonder what it <emph>is</emph> best to do!"</p> 
               <p>"Suppose you tell Nettie?" suggested Flotilla.</p> 
               <p>"Nettie! mercy on us!-I wouldn't do that for the world!" exclaimed Bella. "What a lecture she would read me though if I should."</p> 
               <p>"Well, suppose she did, Bella; she would try to turn you from your purpose no doubt; and you, after a little, could pretend to be convinced that she was right, and promise to dismiss Mr. Sanford immediately, couldn't you? Then you could make her promise not to mention a word of your conversation to any one but Blanche, and get her to make Blanche promise her the same before she told her. In that way, I think you could at least prevent its going out from them, that you met Sanford this evening, for neither of them would mention what they were particularly requested not to do; especially if you appeared to place confidence in them. I rather think, however, we had better sleep over the matter now, and decide in the morning what course to take."</p>

               <p>ALTHOUGH Messrs. Beesley and Sanford had arrived in Elville in company, and had taken rooms at the same hotel, they were not at all associated in business, as the reader may have imagined. Mr. Beesley had opened a large dry-goods establishment, and was apparently doing a good business. Mr. Sanford, on the contrary, had not as yet acknowledged any occupation, but had stated that his wealth was quite sufficient to admit of his living as much at his ease as he pleased. He had not yet decided, he said, in what way, or where, it would be best for him to invest his capital, and until he could do so, he should amuse himself, and employ his leisure by hunting, fishing, &amp;c.,-that he considered recreation and country air, as necessary for the improvement of his health; and as he should not now undertake any business before fall, he might as well "rusticate" in Elville, for the intermediate time, as anywhere else.</p> 
               <p>Although Mr. Sanford's personal appearance, as far as face and figure were concerned, was in his favor, he had not been in Elville four weeks, before he became notorious on account of his extreme egotism, and in one way or another, had<pb n=""/> made himself more enemies than had ever before fallen to the lot of any individual in that village.</p> 
               <p>The number who believed his statements regarding himself, and who had not become disgusted with his general conduct and conversation, were few indeed; and latterly it had been more than whispered that he was a finished gamester, and that many hours of each day were spent by him at gambling tables.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Beesley had conducted himself in a much more modest manner; and as he <emph>appeared</emph> not only frank and obliging, but sensible and good humored, he soon won the <emph>general</emph> good opinion of all classes, with whom in his business capacity, or otherwise, he became associated. Still, it must not be supposed that <emph>every</emph> one thought favorably of Mr. Beesley, for there were those in Elville, who looking beneath the surface, considered him remarkable for nothing but fashionable dress, and shrewdness in business matters-who regarded him as the possessor of only a slight degree of intelligence; and had decided, in their own minds, that he was far better pleased with the society and pursuits of the frivolously gay, than with the companionship and occupations of the more sedate and intellectual.</p>

               <p>THE morning next after Bella's interview with Sanford, Mr. and Mrs. Crawford arose, feeling very much "out of sorts" with themselves, and the whole world generally. Mr. Crawford had just enough of a toothache to make him irritable; and the combined watching and anxiety of the previous night, had produced the same effect upon his wife. Mrs. Crawford had employed no servant of any description in her family for some time past; for the reason, that a person who could accomplish a sufficient amount of work in any given time to entitle them in her eyes to their wages, was not obtainable. Indeed, the woman was not to be found in Elville that could out-do, or even keep pace, with Mrs. Crawford in domestic exercises; and the "help" that could not, or would not perform as much as herself, was pronounced perfectly "worthless," and soon discharged with the comforting assurance that they "did not earn their salt."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Crawford, however, did not require her daughters<pb n=""/> to be as industrious as herself, but sought rather to have her notions of gentility carried out through them. She wished her daughters to be genteel and fashionable; and as the majority of young ladies in "the first circle" in Elville were perfectly useless at home, her own daughters were usually allowed to be as indolent as they pleased, without encountering any real opposition on her part, especially when in good humor.</p> 
               <p>On the particular morning mentioned, Mrs. Crawford prepared her breakfast as usual, her daughters remaining in bed, as was their wont, till warned by their mother that the meal was nearly in readiness. Feeling unusually drowsy, the young ladies did not immediately obey the summons, which was repeated again and again with so little intermission that <emph>they</emph> too became irritated, and declared to each other that they would not hasten their movements in the least, or go down to the breakfast-room one minute before it pleased them so to do.</p> 
               <p>At length, with sombre faces they entered the breakfasting apartment, and took their accustomed places at table, beside which, their parents were already seated. Mr. Crawford's usually placid countenance was disfigured by a surly scowl, and Mrs. Crawford sat pouring out the coffee in a very hurried manner, her upper teeth firmly pressed upon her under lip after a style quite common with her when very much determined or displeased. For a moment or two not a word was spoken; the coffee was silently handed to each person, and as silently the toast and other eatables making up<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC5768-00000157"/> the breakfast were distributed and received. Still, everything betokened a storm: and the Misses Crawford dare not open their lips to speak, lest they should provoke the lowering cloud to burst upon their heads. At length Mr. Crawford threw down his knife and fork with an air of extreme disgust.</p> 
               <p>"It's coming now," thought the young ladies.</p> 
               <p>"Pretty breakfast this is to set before a man," he growled. "This toast, wife, is as cold as a stone! it isn't fit for a <emph>dog</emph> to eat."</p> 
               <p>"Very likely, my dear," responded his lady; "but if it only has a <emph>cooling</emph> effect, it will do no harm. I can't take every step myself, and then wait breakfast a half an hour after everything is cooked for <emph>our</emph> young <emph>ladies,</emph> and have everything piping hot too; you needn't expect it," and Mrs. Crawford as she finished pressed her teeth still more severely on the unresisting under lip, and shot a lightning glance at her daughters.</p> 
               <p>"There is no earthly need of your taking every step yourself," returned the husband. "You know very well I'm always willing you should keep help, but the truth is, you are so awful hard to suit that no girl of <emph>spirit</emph> could stay with you long, even if you were disposed to keep her. I positively believe, that there is not a girl <emph>in all creation</emph> that would suit <emph>you.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Well now, I wonder if you wa'n't as much put out and provoked with our last girl as I was, Mr. Crawford. You said yourself the coffee was always muddy, and that she<pb n=""/> never wiped her dishes dry. Yes, sir, and you said she was just the 'sluttishest thing you ever <emph>did</emph> see,' and wanted me to 'ship her off' right away; and when she was gone, you said it just seemed as if we were going to live again. But because I don't choose to be troubled with such jades, that won't earn their salt, is no reason why <emph>I</emph> should be left to do everything;" and Mrs. Crawford gave another sharp, quick look at her daughters.</p> 
               <p>"Why don't you make your lazy girls work then," interrogated the husband, "instead of letting them lie a bed mornings, while <emph>you</emph> stew over the cooking-stove? Their father works, and their mother works, and I should like to know how it comes about that <emph>they</emph> are too good to dip the tips of their fingers in dish-water, or to hardly touch a broom with their hands;-they're old enough, big enough, and well enough to work, and you ought to make them do it <emph>too!</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Ought to! O yes, I ought to move mountains I s'pose!" returned Mrs. Crawford. "You know very well what trouble I have to get a chore out of them; it's actually more work to make <emph>them</emph> work, than it is to do it myself; and then they are always complaining of being so dreadful tired if they do the leastest thing that ever was."</p> 
               <p>"It's all because <emph>you</emph> haven't brought them up to it;" said Mr. Crawford. "Now I don't believe in letting girls grow up so helpless for fashion's sake, or for anything else-it is a downright sin, Mrs. Crawford, and a shame too. You worked and slaved for them when they were little, and now,<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC5768-00000158"/> the least they can do would be to help you all they can-and you are to blame if they don't do it too."</p> 
               <p>"Our girls are very delicate," returned the mother in softened tones, "they haint stout nor strong, nor very hearty either; they can't stand much, but then, they might do a great deal more than they do, without hurting them at all, dear knows?"</p> 
               <p>"No, they can't stand <emph>work</emph> at all, I know," returned the husband, "it makes their feet ache <emph>awfully</emph> to stand on them in the kitchen an half hour; but they can <emph>stand</emph> pretty well in the street, and <emph>walk it</emph> too-they can run around in the <emph>street</emph> without tiring them a bit, and sometimes, <emph>half the night</emph> too," and now Mr. Crawford fixed a searching gaze on his eldest daughter's face.</p> 
               <p>"Where were you last night, Bell?" he immediately asked.</p> 
               <p>"I was at widow Belton's,"-Bella reddened a little as she answered.</p> 
               <p>"Did you spend the evening there?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes sir; Kate and I were calculating to run down to Esquire Edgeway's, but company came in before we could get started, and so of course Kate couldn't go; and as I didn't wish to go alone, she persuaded me to stay and help her entertain them, as Blanche was from home during the fore part of the evening."</p> 
               <p>"What company was there?" asked Mrs. Crawford.</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Beesley and the Miss Flavells," replied Bella, without looking up.</p> 
               <p>The Miss Flavells had resided in Elville only about six<pb n=""/> months, and occupied a house not very far from Mrs. Belton's. Bella mentioned <emph>their</emph> names, because they were, as yet, strangers to her father and mother, and therefore, in no danger of exposing her falsehood to them. Mr. Beesley, she knew was in the habit of calling upon Kate, and she thought it quite probable he had spent that very evening with her, for Kate was expecting him, she thought, when she left her."</p> 
               <p>"And so Mr. Beesley was <emph>there,</emph> was he?" asked the father quickly. "You are quite <emph>sure</emph> it was <emph>him</emph> and not Mr. Sanford?"</p> 
               <p>"Why father, you know Mr. Sanford wouldn't call at Mrs. Belton's, Mrs. Belton or Kate don't speak to him when they meet him face to face, they can't bear him, nor I either <emph>now.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Quite a sudden change in your views, it appears to me," said the father, sneeringly. "But did I understand you to say that Mr. <emph>Beesley</emph> was at Mrs. Belton's last evening?"</p> 
               <p>"Why father, what makes you ask <emph>that</emph> question over and over again, when I have distinctly said he <emph>was</emph> there?"</p> 
               <p>"Because, young lady, I was in Mr. Beesley's store, last evening, at about nine o'clock, and he was there <emph>then,</emph> and had been all the evening. He said his books had got behind hand, and that he should have to sit up late nights for some time, in order to get them up again. So I should like to know, if perfectly convenient, how he could have been at Mrs. Belton's?"</p> 
               <p>Bella began to be very much confused, but before she had time to frame a reply, Flotilla came to her relief.</p> 
               <p>"Why Bella!" she exclaimed, "you told <emph>me</emph> last night it<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC5768-00000159"/> was <emph>after</emph> nine before Mr. Beesley came to Mrs. Belton's, and that Kate was disappointed because he didn't get there sooner, and now father has understood you to say he was there all the evening."</p> 
               <p>"I didn't mean to be understood so," said Bella, now somewhat reassured; "for as I told you last night it was a considerable time after nine before he came. He walked over with the Miss Flavells as far as the door, and then promised Kate to return as early as nine, but it was quite a good deal after nine when he made his appearance, but he excused himself by saying, it was utterly impossible for him to get away from his business sooner."</p> 
               <p>"Then you did not see Mr. Sanford at all, last night?"</p> 
               <p>"Mercy!-no sir," answered the young girl, in a tone of surprise.</p> 
               <p>"I forbade his attempting to speak with me, some time ago, and I have no reasons now for thinking he would wish to undertake it; but if he should, it will do him no good, I can tell him <emph>that.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"<emph>There,</emph> Mr. Crawford!" exclaimed his partner, "I told you I believed Bella was coming to her senses, and now thought as meanly of that scamp as we do."</p> 
               <p>"Well, mother, I hope you are right," returned Mr. Crawford; "but <emph>I</emph> don't believe in trusting too much to appearances; I, for one, don't mean to have <emph>my</emph> eyes woolled over by one of my own children; I mean to <emph>know</emph> how much reliance can be placed on Bell's statements, before I give them entire credence."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>Mr. Crawford, having finished his coffee, now arose from his chair, and putting on his hat with an air of decision, hurried into the street.</p> 
               <p>Bella and her sister were much frightened by their father's words, and as soon as he was out of their sight, they hastened to their apartment, for the purpose of devising some course of action suited to the present emergency. After much consultation, it was decided that Bella should immediately call upon Nettie Carrol, ostensibly to borrow a collar pattern, but in reality to carry out the plan proposed by her sister the night before. This done, she was to proceed to Mrs. Belton's, and after explaining to Kate her present situation, was to charge her, on no account to suffer her parents to learn through her, that their daughter did not pass the entire evening in her society.</p> 
               <p>The young ladies were somewhat afraid their father would question Mr. Beesley, in which case, Bella's falsehood would unquestionably be discovered. After a little reflection, however, they concluded that as the gentleman was so much of a stranger to their father, he would not be likely to call upon him for such a purpose, especially as his business did not lead him at all in the direction of Mr. Beesley's shop, and by the time business hours were over, they trusted the circumstances of the morning would have been forgotten. Still, it was thought important for Bella to make use of every possible precaution immediately, and for this purpose she hastened to prepare herself for going out.</p> 
               <p>It was also determined, that Bella should in no way commit<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC5768-00000160"/> mit the part Flotilla had taken, or should hereafter take in the matter, either prior or subsequent to her marriage; and in order that no suspicion of favoring Mr. Sanford's pretensions should attach to the younger lady, it was resolved that she should continue to speak of the gentleman, when in her parents' presence, in terms as highly disrespectful as possible, and should be continually quarrelling with Bella (a thing not very uncommon, by the way), and even taunt her for having <emph>ever</emph> been in love with such a contemptible fellow as Sanford. This last arrangement was considered particularly necessary, as Flotilla's assistance would undoubtedly be required in the carrying out of the future plans of the lovers, and, as if suspected in the least, she might be so closely watched as to be unable to render the persecuted couple any important aid, however much it might be desired.</p> 
               <p>"Where are you going?" asked Mrs. Crawford, crossly, as Bella, shawled and bonneted, entered the sitting-room.</p> 
               <p>"I'm just going out for a little walk," answered the young lady.</p> 
               <p>"Just going out for a little walk," repeated the mother mockingly; "let me tell you, miss," she continued, "that I think it would look better in you to stay to home and help your mother; there's no need of your gadding so much, and I a'n't a going to slave myself to death, and work my finger-nails off any more, for the sake of letting you lazy girls play up <emph>lady!</emph>-I sha'n't do it, you may just calculate on <emph>that.</emph> You have got 'to turn over a new leaf,' mighty sudden, for I won't have sich works. Why don't you sweep and dust the parlor?"</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"It isn't dirty; besides, Floll agreed to sweep it out, if it needed it."</p> 
               <p>"But you needn't think I'm going to do it always, Miss Bell, or often either," said Flotilla, catching up a broom as she spoke, and moving in the direction of the parlor.</p> 
               <p>"If you don't get that collar pattern for me while you are out," she added, "I shan't do anything more for you in <emph>one</emph> while."</p> 
               <p>"Well don't be so cross," returned Bella, in an equally pettish tone; "you know you don't <emph>often</emph> hurt yourself by helping <emph>me,</emph>" and the speaker moved towards the door.</p> 
               <p>"Where are you going to walk to?" inquired Mrs. Crawford, stepping between her daughter and the door. "You don't stir one step, till you tell me where you're going!"</p> 
               <p>"I was only going to borrow a new collar pattern of Nettie Carrol," replied Miss Crawford. "She has a collar that's a perfect beauty, and Floll and I want the pattern. I know I can make one exactly like it, if I can only get the pattern, and have another good look at Nettie's."</p> 
               <p>"What is it like?" asked Mrs. Crawford, becoming in spite of herself really interested.</p> 
               <p>"O it's different from anything I ever saw before; I know you would like it; anyway, I'll borrow the collar and let you see it for yourself."</p> 
               <p>Bella now proceeded to the door, without further interruption from her mother; but had hardly passed into the hall, when she was confronted by her father, who caught her by<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC5768-00000161"/> the arm, as she was endeavoring to slip by him, and conducted her in no very gentle manner, to the sitting-room.</p> 
               <p>"Sit there young woman!" he exclaimed, seating her rather rudely upon the lounge, "and see if you can't contrive up some more lies to tell your parents and sister. You can 'take off your things,' for you are not to stir out of this house again, without your mother or father for company in <emph>one</emph> while."</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Crawford what do you mean?" uttered his wife, turning pale, "how rude you are-what is the matter!"</p> 
               <p>"Matter enough I should think!" returned the excited man; "this hopeful daughter of ours, has been lying to us all, by the wholesale; I have just learned from Mr. Beesley's own lips, that he <emph>was not</emph> at Mrs. Belton's house <emph>at all</emph> last night."</p> 
               <p>"O how shocking!" exclaimed Mrs. Crawford; "but Mr. Crawford I do hope you didn't go there <unclear>and</unclear> ask Beesley about it, and expose Bella so, to a stranger!"</p> 
               <p>"Don't make a fool of yourself, Mrs. Crawford! I guess I am not so big an idiot as not 'to know which side my bread is buttered,'-<emph>I</emph> know how to manage to find out what I want to know, without <emph>seeming</emph> to have any <emph>particular</emph> object in view, I guess; and I've found out enough this morning to convince <emph>me</emph> that Bella richly deserves to be turned out of doors. As I said before, Mrs. Crawford, Mr. Beesley was <emph>not</emph> at Mrs. Belton's last night, <emph>neither was</emph> Miss Crawford! Young lady," he continued, turning to his daughter, "what have you to say for yourself <emph>now?</emph>"</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"There's no use in my saying anything, sir," answered Bella, as soon as she could command her voice sufficiently to speak; "for you won't believe anything I say."</p> 
               <p>"Why not, young lady? why don't I believe you? you can answer <emph>that</emph> question very easily I imagine."</p> 
               <p>"It is because you don't choose to, I suppose, and <emph>I</emph> don't choose to stay <emph>here,</emph> and be treated as I have been this morning, any longer; I guess I can find <emph>some one</emph> willing to give me a home."</p> 
               <p>"No doubt of <emph>that,</emph> Miss Crawford, I suppose Mr. Sanford stands ready to give you one for a <emph>little while</emph> at least, almost any time, and I dare say you are quite as ready to accept of it; but let me tell you, Bell, the moment you become that fellow's wife, we will disown you-we will no longer consider you a child of ours. But I shall give you no chance to commit such madness-you shall be a close prisoner until you can get over this folly."</p> 
               <p>"I am <emph>of age,</emph> sir!" exclaimed Bella, angrily; "you have no right to attempt to confine me in this way; and I shan't stand it!"</p> 
               <p>"Right or no right, we shall do it!" returned the gentleman; "we shall consider you a lunatic, and watch over you as such, until you can come to your senses."</p> 
               <p>"I should like to know what I have done, that I should be so persecuted and abused," said Bella, bursting into tears; "even if I hadn't been at Mrs. Belton's <emph>all</emph> the time, I was there the fore-part of the evening, and Kate will tell you so too."</p> 
               <pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC5768-00000162"/> 
               <p>"And I suppose you didn't see Sanford <emph>at all</emph> last night, you innocent little lamb, did you! and you didn't come home with falsehoods in your mouth for your parents and sister! You haven't seen Mr. Sanford for a <emph>long time</emph> have you?</p> 
               <p>"<emph>No, sir, I have not!</emph>" and Bella suddenly raised her eyes with a defiant look, to her father's, as she spoke.</p> 
               <p>"Take care-take care, Bella, don't utter another falsehood, at least before your last one is cool!"</p> 
               <p>"Do <emph>you know</emph> that Bella <emph>did</emph> meet Sanford last night, Mr. Crawford?" asked the mother, nervously.</p> 
               <p>"I have excellent reasons for <emph>thinking</emph> she did," replied her husband; "at all events, we must see that she does not have an opportunity of meeting him <emph>again.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"I'll keep an eye on her ladyship," said Mrs. Crawford; "for I don't want that dressed up 'blackleg' for a son-in-law no more than you do. Bella, take off your things why don't you? take 'em off now, and when my work is done, I'll go with you for that pattern if you want it."</p> 
               <p>"Bell, what in creation made you tell me such fibs for, last night?" said Flotilla, with apparent displeasure; "it was mean in you, and didn't do you any good after all;-I am glad of <emph>that</emph> at any rate. For my part I can't see what you can find in that hateful Sanford to like; I perfectly detest him!"</p> 
               <p>"Flotilla, stop your noise!" said Mrs. Crawford peremptorily.</p> 
               <p>Bella did not attempt any reply to her sister, but covering her face with her hands, wept long and violently.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>Although Miss Crawford was not allowed to step beyond the precincts of her home, unless accompanied by one of her parents; and although Flotilla had, by authority, been placed as a spy over her imprudent sister, with strict orders to report immediately the first attempt on Bella's part to communicate in any way with Sanford; (to which command she had promised implicit obedience). It so happened that note after note was written by "The distressed Arabella," to her "Faithful Edward," and by some means conveyed to him; and that such notes were responded to by the lover in terms as romantic and impassioned as the young lady could desire.</p>

               <p>"MRS. CARROL!-Nettie!-have you heard the news?" exclaimed Susan Champell, as she entered Mrs. Carrol's sitting-room, not many days after the occurrence of the scenes described in our last chapter; "but I see you have not," she added, "so I shall be the first to tell you. Bella Crawford eloped with Sanford last night."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Carrol looked up with an expression of surprise upon her countenance, but Nettie asserted that it was no more<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC5768-00000163"/> than she had expected of Bella, having always thought that as a mere matter of choice, she would prefer an elopement to a civil marriage at home; and that for some time past, she had been convinced that the missing couple were betrothed lovers, notwithstanding Bella's professed aversion to the gentleman of her choice.</p> 
               <p>"And so they are married:" she said. "Poor Bella! I pity her with all my heart."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I suppose they are married before this time," returned Miss Champell; "for she left a note for her parents saying, that a justice, in an adjoining town, was to be provided with suitable witnesses, and in readiness to perform the marriage ceremony at precisely four o'clock this morning; and that after their marriage, they should proceed directly to New York city, where they should remain for several weeks at least. She begged her father's and mother's forgiveness, and urged them to look upon both Mr. Sanford and herself, as their affectionate children. She had no parting word (she wrote) to leave for Flotilla, for <emph>she</emph> had treated her so little like a sister of late, and her dear Edward had suffered so much abuse from her tongue, that she neither asked or cared for her forgiveness or approval. O you ought to have seen Mrs. Crawford and Flotilla this morning, when I did. I never saw Mrs. Crawford so much excited in my life, and Flotilla seemed to be in a perfect rage!"</p> 
               <p>"How did you happen there just at <emph>this</emph> time?" asked Mrs. Carrol.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"I went over on an errand quite early this morning, and had not heard a lisp of the affair 'till I heard it there."</p> 
               <p>"Did you hear any of the particulars?" asked Nettie.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Mrs. Crawford and Flotilla told me all they knew about it themselves; they say they can't imagine how she contrived to get away, for she had not been allowed to go into the street for several days past, and had had no opportunity of communicating with the gentleman either privately or otherwise that they knew of. Mrs. Crawford says her husband was up writing last night until nearly twelve o'clock, and did not fall asleep for some time after he had retired, and that he did not once hear a sound in or about the house as of persons moving; but almost the first thing he saw this morning after rising, was a large, white cloth, hanging from his daughter's open window. He immediately rushed up stairs, and found Bella's room vacant-the sheets stripped from the bed, and tied together in a hard knot; a corner of one sheet was firmly fastened to the bedstead, (which it seems stands near the window), and the opposite corner of the other sheet was swinging about five feet above the ground, outside of the house. Two trunks of Bella's were also found wide open, and completely rifled of their contents; the pillowcases had been drawn from the pillows, and as they were no where to be found, they suppose they were filled with clothing and thrown from the window. Mr. Crawford, it seems, at first supposed both daughters had fled, for Flotilla roomed with Bella, and she too was missing. Mrs. Crawford being astonished at seeing her husband do so unusual a thing as to<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC5768-00000164"/> go up stairs, especially in such a hurried manner, quickly followed him, and I suppose the scene that followed was almost beyond description."</p> 
               <p>"I can imagine something of what it must have been," said Nettie. "But where was Flotilla all this time?"</p> 
               <p>"I'll tell you when I come to that part of my story," said Susan, smilingly; "you have got to hear the history in the same <emph>order</emph> that I received it myself; but you mustn't think I give it in the same <emph>manner</emph> though."</p> 
               <p>"No-<emph>hardly,</emph>" returned Nettie; "but pray excuse my impatience, and go on with your narrative."</p> 
               <p>"Where was I?-O-well, Mrs. Crawford soon found the note Bella had written, and it was eagerly perused by both parents, and its contents convinced them that Flotilla had not left in company with her sister; still it was evident that she was not in her usual place, and had not been for some hours at least, and their alarm for a few moments was extreme. At length, Mrs. Crawford recollected that her daughters had had an uncommonly serious quarrel the night before, and that Flotilla, before retiring, had declared she would not occupy the same bed with her sister.</p> 
               <p>As soon as Mrs. Crawford had mentioned this circumstance to her husband, they both proceeded to a chamber not far distant, and there, sure enough, they found Flotilla as fast asleep as if nothing had happened.</p> 
               <p>"Flotilla says, that <emph>now</emph> she has no doubt but that Bella was so provoking last night, on purpose to get her too angry to sleep with her, in order to escape without her knowledge;<pb n=""/> but that, if she had once suspected her object, she would have borne anything from her rather than have left her alone. They all think she must have slidden down by means of the sheets, for all the doors below were found fastened as usual. I declare I feel very sorry for poor Mrs. Crawford, and for Flotilla too, for they both feel <emph>very</emph> badly. It is too bad for a young lady to conduct in such a way."</p> 
               <p>"It is indeed," answered Nettie. "But, poor Bella! a few years, I fear, will find her repenting deeply the step she has taken now."</p> 
               <p>"A few years," repeated Susan, "I shall be surprised if she does not find she has thrown herself away, before three months are gone."</p> 
               <p>"Do you think her parents will receive her into favor again?" inquired Mrs. Carrol.</p> 
               <p>"They <emph>say</emph> they will not," replied Susan, "but I presume they will, after a while; "I understand Kate Belton is to be married to Mr. Beesley soon," she continued, turning to Nettie, "do you believe the report?"</p> 
               <p>"I do not," answered Nettie, "for Blanche says she is confident there is no engagement between them yet, and until there is, I hardly think they will marry."</p> 
               <p>"Well, if they don't, it will not be Kate's fault or her mother's either, I apprehend," said Susan, "for it is evident they would like to secure him. I should wish them all success, were it not for their holding maiden ladies in such extreme aversion; but as it is, to tell the truth, I should really<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC5768-00000165"/> like to have Kate an old maid, just to see if she wouldn't change her mind, or at least pretend to."</p> 
               <p>"O Susan, you should not be so malicious!" said Mrs. Carrol, pleasantly; "you ought not to wish your worst enemies visited with what they would regard as a bitter evil; for my part, I hope she will soon be <emph>well</emph> married."</p> 
               <p>"So do I," said Nettie, "for when I see people so anxious to change their condition in life, I always feel relieved for them, when they obtain their wishes. By-the-bye, Susan, speaking of marriage reminds me of what I heard about <emph>you</emph> the other day; I was told that you were positively engaged to Mr. Lawrence, who has been so very attentive to you of late. Now I don't think it fair at all in you, Sue, to take such a step without consulting me. How is it, Susan? You know you promised me once that you would tell me all about it, when you thought of marrying."</p> 
               <p>"But you don't think I'm going to confess right here, in the presence of your respected mother, do you?" returned Miss Champell, gaily. "O Mrs. Carrol, don't leave the room, I beg," she added quickly, as Nettie's mother rose smilingly from her seat, "I don't care about telling Nettie anything this morning-I was only in jest."</p> 
               <p>"Can't help it, my dear, I have not the heart to remain after such a loud hint; besides, I have domestic duties that require my immediate attention, so I must beg to be excused."</p> 
               <p>"Now Susan, how is it?" repeated Nettie, as soon as her mother had closed the door upon them, "is this story true?"</p> 
               <p>"It is not without foundation, and yet it is not true,"<pb n=""/> replied Susan. "I have long suspected that Mr. Lawrence's attentions were serious, and at one time I was disposed to view them favorably; but we have never been engaged, and <emph>now</emph> never shall be."</p> 
               <p>"Why not?"</p> 
               <p>"Because Nettie, I have recently discovered that he entertains sentiments so entirely opposed to mine, and of such a nature, that one constituted like myself could not reasonably hope to live happily with him. Had he made his proposals only a few days sooner than he did, I should perhaps have accepted him, for his company was agreeable to me, and I had <emph>then</emph> seen nothing in him calculated to occasion dislike. But a few evenings ago, when in conversation with him, I alluded to the efforts that were being made by some gentlemen to improve the condition of married ladies, by the obtaining of a law granting them the right of holding property, and inquired if he thought they would be successful. I wish Nettie you could have seen with what spirit he answered me. I never saw a person display more bitterness in my life."</p> 
               <p>"'There were <emph>no gentlemen</emph> engaged in such business,' he said, 'but a few <emph>henpecked fools</emph> were trying to alter the laws; that he neither wished them success or feared their influence, for their efforts would amount to no more than those of a mouse <emph>who</emph> should attempt to move a mountain, and he had no patience with such silly creatures!' He then went on to say, 'that the laws were the very best they either <emph>could</emph> or <emph>should</emph> be; that a true woman would take pride in acknowledging<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC5768-00000166"/> edging her dependence upon, and her inferiority to man, and his right to hold jurisdiction over her; that Adam was first formed, and then Eve,' and so on, and finally wound up by saying, that when <emph>he</emph> married, he intended to be '<emph>sole</emph> head and ruler in his own house, in everything, and that he trusted I was too sensible a girl to be led away in the least by such fanatical innovations.'"</p> 
               <p>"What reply did you make to this 'Lord of Creation,'" exclaimed Nettie.</p> 
               <p>"I didn't say much," replied Susan, "you know I never can, but I kept up a desperate thinking, and made up my mind <emph>then</emph> and <emph>there,</emph> that if he wanted a partner, or rather, an upper servant, he might look elsewhere. I merely said that Adam's being first formed, I considered no good argument in favor of man's superiority over woman, for, in that case, the fishes of the sea, and fowls of the air, and the four-footed beasts might be pronounced above him, as their creation was prior to his. Mr. Lawrence smiled, but it was not a pleasant smile, and soon after he departed. Night before last, according to a previous engagement, he called to accompany me to a lecture. I pleaded a cold, and requested him to excuse me. Mr. Lawrence replied, that he was not at all particular about attending the lecture, and would prefer spending an hour or so with me, as I was unable to go out, if I was disengaged. After an half hour's conversation on indifferent subjects, he abruptly offered me his hand, the honor of which I at once declined. He seemed surprised, and told me plainly that I had given him decided encouragement<pb n=""/> ment, or he should not have made me the proposal. This I admitted as quite possible, and assured him, that until very recently, I had seen nothing in him to induce me to do otherwise with sincerity; but, that I was <emph>now</emph> fully convinced that our views did not sufficiently harmonize to render happiness in such a union probable, if possible, and that under such circumstances I could not consent to marry any man. Mr. Lawrence said he thought he understood to what I referred; and <emph>if</emph> the fact of his entertaining the views he had expressed in my presence a short time before, was the ground of my objection to him, the very circumstance of my making <emph>that</emph> an objection, would be sufficient to create in his mind a strong objection to me. I then told him I was rejoiced to find that in this one respect our feelings were mutual.</p> 
               <p>"So you see, Nettie, I am not engaged to him and could never be, for we neither of us want the other, and I am glad enough the gentleman is so much resigned, for it will save me a good deal of self-reproach."</p> 
               <p>"And you think you could not have lived happily with him, Susan?"</p> 
               <p>"I <emph>know</emph> I could not, Nettie, for however much I may be disposed to yield my inclinations to those of my husband, I should wish to consider it my privilege, and do it voluntarily-not have it <emph>demanded</emph> of me as a duty. Indeed, Nettie, I never could love, or even honor my husband, if he intentionally observed a lordly manner towards me, making known his wishes in the form of commands! peaceable as <emph>I</emph> generally am, I feel that my whole nature would rebel under such<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC5768-00000167"/> treatment. I will not, therefore, knowingly, marry a man of an arbitrary disposition; and Mr. Lawrence has, in my view, fully proven himself of that description: do you not think so?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Susan, and were I in your place, I should feel that I had been blessed with a very fortunate escape."</p> 
               <p>"I <emph>do,</emph> Nettie. Still, I suppose he is far preferable to Sanford."</p> 
               <p>"O yes. Poor Bella!"</p>

               <p>AFTER a month's absence, Mr. Sanford and lady returned to Elville, and took rooms in its most fashionable hotel. Mr. Sanford was lavish in his expenditures; and after a time, Mrs. Crawford began to think his wealth of a more substantial nature than was generally supposed by the majority of the villagers, and that Bella had not done so poorly after all. Consequently, she began to feel an inclination to exercise a<pb n=""/> spirit of forgiveness, to extend the maternal hand to the offenders, and bid them welcome home. This disposition was considerably increased by the arrival of a prettily-written note, full of affection and penitence, which was addressed by Mrs. Sanford to her parents, about a week after her return to Elville.</p> 
               <p>In this note, Bella declared that nothing but the absence of her parents' smiles stood between her and happiness, and begged of them to accept, as tokens of penitence, an accompanying gold ring, which, she said, was designed for her mother, and a pin of rare workmanship which she had purchased expressly for her father.</p> 
               <p>Mr. and Mrs. Sanford had sent their card, accompanied by a joint note, to Mr. and Mrs. Crawford, the second day after their arrival in town, but had received no reply. This last note of Bella's, however, was received with more favor, for the parents answered it in person, and invited the happy couple to stop with them until they could complete their arrangements for the future; which invitation was immediately accepted.</p> 
               <p>The silk dress promised Flotilla soon gladdened her eyes, and was richer and more beautiful than even her lively fancy had pictured. For a time everything passed off well, Mr. Sanford appeared to almost idolize his young wife, and was in reality extremely fond of her beauty; but after the first few days, Mrs. and Miss Crawford began to discover that Bella stood greatly in fear of her husband, and hardly dare open her lips in his presence without first glancing at him, as<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC5768-00000168"/> if to satisfy herself of his approval, and that she was far from being as happy as she professed herself.</p> 
               <p>Gradually Mr. Sanford threw off all restraint, and notwithstanding he often fondled his wife as if she were a child, and always wished her to dress handsomely, and look prettily, he frequently insulted and abused her, even in the presence of her parents and sister; and when her parents presumed to interfere in her behalf, he coolly assured them he desired no directions from them, as he should at all times, and in all places, manage Mrs. Sanford precisely as he thought best.</p> 
               <p>Sanford did not appear in any haste to decide upon business, or a home, for the future; but seemed quite content to remain at his father-in-law's, and quite willing and likely to encroach upon his hospitality for an indefinite period to come. From his manner, a stranger would readily infer that he was in his own house; and even there, playing the lord and master quite too extensively for his credit. Whatever he wished for, he did not request, but <emph>ordered;</emph> and that, sometimes, in so insulting a manner, that even the servant-girl, whom poor Mrs. Crawford had found it necessary to hire, complained bitterly of "Mister's uncivilness," and declared she could not "put up with his airs much longer."</p> 
               <p>Week after week passed away, and to all appearance Mr. Sanford and lady were no nearer leaving their present quarters, than on the day of their arrival. The family knew nothing of Sanford's plans; for he had invariably, when questioned concerning them, manifested much anger, without making any satisfactory reply; and as he was usually more<pb n=""/> than commonly rude to his wife, after such interrogatories, they soon wholly refrained from making any inquiries on the subject.</p> 
               <p>Soon after taking up his residence in Mr. Crawford's family, Sanford, under various pretences, had succeeded in borrowing of his father-in-law nearly two hundred dollars, promising to return the same in a week or two at most; but many weeks passed away, and not a syllable was said of returning the money. Mr. Crawford at length became uneasy, and inquired when he would return the sum borrowed.</p> 
               <p>"Not 'till I get ready, if ever, sir," was the impudent answer. Mr. Crawford did not turn the gentleman from the house, as many would have done under such circumstances, but for his daughter's sake, he endeavored to smother the anger that burned in his heart, sufficiently to prevent its rising to his lips.</p> 
               <p>Bella was so often found in tears by her sister, that she at length confessed, that Mr. Sanford was very unkind and abusive to her, and that many times she had wished she had never seen his face.</p> 
               <p>"He treats me," she said, "exactly as he would a dog, that he felt himself at liberty to fondle, or kick, at his pleasure."</p> 
               <p>After making this confession to Flotilla, Bella begged of her, not to inform any of the household that she had acknowledged herself miserable, as her husband, if he only <emph>suspected</emph> that she had breathed a word of complaint, would probably be more cruel to her than ever.</p> 
               <pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC5768-00000169"/> 
               <p>But Sanford's tyranny over his young wife had become, in a measure, too public; Bella's changed manners too apparent, and the smile she wore too evidently forced, to escape the notice of Elville people; and rumors of his conduct towards her while at the hotel, were rife in the village. Even the boys looked upon him as a tyrant, and spoke of him familiarly, as "Bluebeard the second."</p> 
               <p>After Mr. Crawford had spoken to his son-in-law concerning the money he had loaned of him, Sanford became more abusive than ever, especially to his wife, who bore his illusage far more patiently than, before her marriage, she had ever been known to bear the slightest rebuke.</p> 
               <p>Mr. and Mrs. Crawford endured this state of things until they felt that patience would no longer be a virtue; until they could no longer submit to his insolence themselves, or bear to see their daughter becoming the most abject of slaves, beneath their own roof. They then resolved to offer Bella a permanent home with them, on condition of her parting with Sanford; but, at the same time, assure her that they would no longer harbor her husband.</p> 
               <p>Bella wept much, when her parents communicated to her their determination; and acknowledged that she had scarcely seen a happy day since her marriage. She would gladly part with her husband, she said, if she only dared; but feared, that should she do so, he would be revenged upon her in some way, and perhaps seek her life. Mr. Crawford assured her of his protection, if she would consent to the measure proposed<pb n=""/> posed, and also plainly told her that if she refused, she need look for no further assistance from her parents.</p> 
               <p>In reply to her father, Bella said, if she could only be convinced that Sanford did not love her, she would at once decide to leave him; but, that after all, she believed he was as much attached to her as his nature would admit of his being to any one; for, he not only sometimes confessed himself <emph>sorry,</emph> after having been particularly abusive, but had frequently appeared really fond of her. She admitted, she had no hope of happiness while living with him, and was confident she could not endure long under the treatment she was constantly receiving at his hand; and yet, if she separated from him, she said her doing so would undoubtedly occasion many remarks, that under the circumstances, would be exceedingly mortifying to her pride. Bella's parents then informed her, that she was already well known in Elville as an abused and suffering wife, and that parting with her husband would provoke no remarks of a more-unpleasant nature than those already made; but, that of course, she must do as she pleased in the matter, and could have until the next day, to reflect upon their proposition.</p> 
               <p>Mr. and Mrs. Crawford now arose to leave the room, but before they had reached the door, which they had secured upon their entrance, they heard Mr. Sanford's step outside; and in another instant, having tried the latch, he was knocking his feet violently against the door.</p> 
               <p>"Bella!" he exclaimed in thunder-tones, "open the door instantly!-what do you mean by locking <emph>me</emph> out!"</p> 
               <pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC5768-00000170"/> 
               <p>Mrs. Sanford quickly started to her feet, and would have obeyed, but her father pushed her back.</p> 
               <p>"Madam,-Mrs. Sanford! open this door instantly, or by -- I'll break it down!" continued the passionate man.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Crawford deliberately turned the key, and Sanford burst into the room, his face and lips perfectly colorless with rage. Without paying the slightest attention to Mr. or Mrs. Crawford, he proceeded directly to his wife, who had sunk upon a chair in the farthest corner of the room.</p> 
               <p>"What did you lock me out for?" he demanded, laying down his fist on the little table by her side, with so much force, as to make everything on it tremble.</p> 
               <p>"I didn't," she replied.</p> 
               <p>"Who did, then?"</p> 
               <p>"Father."</p> 
               <p>"I should like to know what right your father has in <emph>this</emph> room!-why didn't <emph>you</emph> unlock the door when I told you to?"</p> 
               <p>"Father wouldn't let me," sobbed Bella.</p> 
               <p>"Father wouldn't let me," repeated Sanford, mockingly; "<emph>I'll</emph> let you know <emph>one</emph> thing madam, you are to mind <emph>me,</emph> when I speak, not your father;" and he laid a sharp blow upon her cheek as he finished.</p> 
               <p>"Villain! what do you mean?" exclaimed the enraged father, rushing forward, and seizing Sanford by the arm. "How <emph>dare</emph> you strike my child, and in the presence of her mother and myself!"</p> 
               <p>"Because, sir," returned Sanford, rudely pushing his father-in-law from him, "because <emph>your</emph> child is <emph>my</emph> wife, and<pb n=""/> 
                  <emph>I</emph> shall do with her as <emph>I</emph> please. One thing at least I intend she <emph>shall</emph> learn, which is to obey me at <emph>once,</emph> when I command, and I will allow no one to interfere with me in the exercise of my authority."</p> 
               <p>"You are the foulest blot that can be found on the face of the earth!" exclaimed Mr. Crawford, passionately; "and this is the last day we will feed you at our table, or harbor you under our roof; I am determined, sir, so you can make your arrangements to leave here to-morrow"</p> 
               <p>"Give me money to keep your daughter somewhere else, and we will go to-day," returned Sanford; "but if you won't do <emph>that,</emph> and turn us out of doors, I tell you plainly, you may some day have the pleasure of seeing your daughter beg in the streets; for <emph>I</emph> have nothing to support her with, and shouldn't do it if I had, <emph>alone.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"This is pretty talk for you, sir!" exclaimed Mrs. Crawford, indignantly; "you, who cheated my daughter into thinking you was 'rich as a Jew,' and all that. I see you are jest what you have been taken for in Elville; jest the lyingest scamp that ever <emph>did</emph> live. I see it's all true that husband have heard about you, time and again. Why-"</p> 
               <p>"Ignorant woman!" interrupted Sanford.</p> 
               <p>"Don't you interrupt <emph>me,</emph> you lazy dog!" retorted the lady. "Ignorant woman indeed!-I can teach you <emph>manners</emph> at least. Why don't you go to work I say? why haven't you <emph>been</emph> to work, if you are so poverty-stricken, instead of 'sucking your fingers,' and living on us?"</p> 
               <p>"Because, madam, I can get what money I want for myself<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC5768-00000171"/> 
                  <emph>self, without</emph> working, when I'm at all in luck; besides, what is the use of having a rich father-in-law, if one has got to work for his bread."</p> 
               <p>"Don't call <emph>me</emph> your father-in-law!" said Mr. Crawford, "I won't own you at all; and rich or not rich, you'll find you have had the very last cent you will ever get out of me. We have just told Bella." he continued, "that she can stay with us, and we will provide for, and protect her-that is, if she will give you up entirely; but, if she chooses to risk herself any longer with you, she must get along the best way she can, for we shall do nothing more for her."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Sanford now began to look really frightened.</p> 
               <p>"You don't mean to say you would be guilty of such a base and cruel act, as that of separating husband and wife, do you?" he exclaimed; "if you do, you will be disappointed-for Bella <emph>shall not</emph> leave me, I will never part with her while I live.</p> 
               <p>"You don't mean to leave your Edward, do you, Arabella dear?" he continued, turning to his wife, with a tenderness of expression he well knew how to assume. "You wouldn't leave me alone, if you could, would you darling?" and he smoothed her hair caressingly as he spoke.</p> 
               <p>"You have treated me very rudely," sobbed Bella.</p> 
               <p>"I am afraid I have been a little too harsh, sometimes," answered the husband, "but I have <emph>meant</emph> it all for your good, love; and after all, there is nothing so dear to me in life as my charming little wife."</p> 
               <p>"Bella, my daughter, don't be deceived again by his professions<pb n=""/> fessions," said Mr. Crawford: "he don't deserve any of a wife's affections-he is not fit to have a wife at all. Remember what your mother and I have told you, and decide prudently, for your decision must be a permanent one." The parents then left the room.</p> 
               <p>Bella did decide; but it was to remain with Sanford, who, by means of many promises of amendment, and a great display of romantic tenderness, succeeded in persuading her, that both her happiness and duty required her to remain with him.</p> 
               <p>The next day, at an early hour, they left Elville for a distant town; where Sanford opened a school for young gentlemen, which, Bella wrote her sister, promised to do very well; she also stated, that Sanford treated her much better than when at her father's house, and had assured her he never should have conducted towards her as he did when there, had he not discovered that his doing so tormented her parents, (whom he especially disliked,) more than anything else.</p> 
               <p>Meanwhile, summer flowers had passed away, and autumn's variegated tints had appeared in their stead; making the face of nature beautiful.</p> 
               <p>Charlie Lee had returned to his home, much improved in health and spirits, and firmly believing (his mission having been eminently successful) that he had been instrumental in saving his father from great embarrassment, if not utter ruin. After a short stay at home, he had again left Elville for the purpose of finishing his collegiate course.</p> 
               <p>The Misses Edgeway had recently married gentlemen<pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC5768-00000172"/> from out of town, and were said to be very pleasantly situated in their new homes.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Beesley still called at Mrs. Belton's but of late had evinced rather more pleasure in Blanche's society, than was perfectly agreeable to either Kate or her mother. Mr. Lawrence also called frequently upon Miss Belton, and bestowed upon her a considerable attention, which the mother encouraged; hoping Mr. Beesley would thereby be made sufficiently jealous to hasten the proposal, which she was confident he designed making her daughter.</p> 
               <p>Miss Trenton had spent the latter part of the summer out of town, for the purpose of visiting a friend, and was still absent; but many, ill-naturedly, asserted her true object was to seek a husband more genteel than any she could obtain in Elville.</p> 
               <p>Flotilla Crawford, though only eighteen, was encouraging the devout attentions of an old bachelor of forty-five; whom, it was reported, she intended to marry, on account of his wealth, which was not inconsiderable.</p> 
               <p>As usual, Nettie, Blanche, and Susan, had had their reputed admirers; but as the gossips could not discover that they gave encouragement to one more than another, it was at length decided by them, that Nettie must be under an engagement of marriage to Dr. Milford; that Blanche was waiting for Charlie Lee; and that Susan Champell, having been deeply disappointed by Mr. Lawrence, had, in all probability, decided against matrimony, at <emph>least</emph> for the present. So much for the opinion of the knowing ones; we do not vouch for their correctness.</p>

               <p>THE sun was shedding his setting rays on Elville hills, one pleasant evening, as Blanche left her aunt's house, and directed her steps towards the home of her friend Nettie. Her gait was unusually hurried, and her face wore a strangely troubled expression.</p> 
               <p>"What is the matter Blanche?" asked Nettie, anxiously, who met her at the door; "you are looking much excited; what <emph>is</emph> the matter?"</p> 
               <p>"Take me directly to your room, Nettie, where we shall not be interrupted, and I will tell you all," answered Miss Rathbone. "Something exciting <emph>has</emph> occurred, I assure you, and I wish your advice.</p> 
               <p>Miss Carrol immediately conducted her friend to her quiet little apartment.</p> 
               <p>"Now Blanche, I am ready and anxious to learn what has taken place to disturb you," she said, as soon as they had seated themselves. "Tell me everything."</p> 
               <p>"You know, Nettie," began Blanche, "that my aunt has<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC5768-00000173"/> evaded almost every question that I have ever asked her, concerning the nature of my obligations to her, but by her <emph>conduct,</emph> has led me to suppose, that I was almost entirely dependent upon her generosity for the means of support; this you know, for I have spoken of it to you."</p> 
               <p>Miss Carrol nodded assent.</p> 
               <p>"It was Blanche," continued Miss Rathbone, "that was called upon to go into the kitchen, to superintend, or assist the servants, and who, during their illness or absence, was expected to supply, as far as possible, their places: it was Blanche, that must do this, or that; but Kate, could spend her whole time as she pleased. I did not murmur at this, for I knew that such occupations would be a benefit to me, (though not intended as such,) and I felt it my duty to do all in my power, to help my aunt, and save her expense; and the more so, on account of my supposed dependence upon her. Kate, you have observed, I suppose, has always been better dressed than myself?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes."</p> 
               <p>"This circumstance, though I have never before mentioned it, even to you, I confess mortified me not a little, in my younger years; but this was nothing, compared with the many vexations to which I have constantly been obliged to submit, or to the galling thought, that I was dependent upon my aunt for my daily bread. I longed for independence, and frequently proposed opening a school, but my aunt and cousin always ridiculed the very idea, and opposed me so strongly, that I have never been able to carry any such proposal into execution<pb n=""/> cution. I knew-I <emph>felt</emph> Nettie, that there was that within me, which, if properly cultivated, <emph>should</emph> free me from so humiliating a situation; but I also knew, that I would not be suffered to exercise my talent undisturbed; consequently, the little that I have allowed to be published, has been done without the knowledge of my aunt or cousin. I have sometimes spoken in aunt's presence, of contributing regularly for some magazine, but she has always opposed me, declaring that she could not think of such a thing, for if I was at all criticised (as I probably would be), and it was known that I was <emph>her</emph> niece, it would nearly be the death of her. "There was no need," she would say, "of my doing any such thing, for the sake of money, while <emph>she</emph> lived, for she was perfectly willing I should share with Kate, as I always had done; that I would probably marry sometime, when, of course, my husband would support me." We had a conversation of this nature only a few days ago, after which, the thought (I know not what prompted it) suddenly flashed through my brain, that perhaps, after all, I had not been left entirely dependent upon my aunt's bounty for support; that there must have been at least some <emph>slight</emph> provision made for me. I instantly resolved to question my aunt so closely, that she could not easily avoid giving me a direct answer.</p> 
               <p>"'Aunt,' I said, 'did my parents leave <emph>no</emph> provision for me? Did my mother commit me to your care, and expect <emph>you</emph> to provide for me entirely at your own expense? And have I no guardian but you?'</p> 
               <p>"'Why child, you ask me so many questions at once, that<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC5768-00000174"/> you confuse me,' answered my aunt, (and her looks certainly did not belie her words.) 'What makes you ask such questions,' she continued. 'Havn't you had the same opportunities that Kate has had? and havn't you been supplied with all that was necessary for your comfort.'</p> 
               <p>"'I do not wish to be understood as complaining in the least,' I answered; 'I ask these questions, simply because I feel that it is right that I should understand <emph>exactly</emph> how I have been, and am still situated, in these respects. I am now nearly twenty-one, and if I was given to your charge a destitute orphan, and have subsisted by your means alone until now, I think it quite time I was making some other arrangement for the future, for I can no longer consent to depend upon a widowed aunt for the comforts of life.'</p> 
               <p>"'How foolish you talk, Blanche,' returned my aunt. 'Who ever said you were <emph>entirely</emph> dependent upon me? and if you have been, havn't you saved me enough expense, in one way or another, to pay for all I have laid out for you since you were old enough to be of any assistance?'</p> 
               <p>"'I have certainly <emph>endeavored</emph> to do so,' I replied; 'but aunt, I hope you will not refuse to reply to the questions I have asked you, for I can never rest, until they are answered by <emph>some one.</emph>'</p> 
               <p>"O the questions!-yes-I had quite forgotten but what I had answered them,' returned Aunt Belton, after a little hesitation; '<emph>certainly,</emph> I can have no objections to answering them: let me see,-in the first place I believe you wanted to know whether or no your parents left anything for you; now<pb n=""/> I supposed, I had often told you, your father died bankrupt; but that is nothing "either here or there," if you don't remember it now, I will tell you again. When your mother married, your father was thought to be very well-off, and as your mother carried him a few thousands, it was supposed he would shortly become quite rich; but he turned out to be a regular spend-thrift; for he soon run through almost everything, and after he died, and his debts were paid, there wasn't so much as a copper left for your mother and yourself. But when your mother was on her death-bed, which was soon after your father died,' continued Aunt Belton, 'she received a legacy of a few hundred dollars, a part of which, according to her direction, we (that is brother and myself) took to defray the expenses of her sickness and funeral; the rest we used for your benefit, as far as it would go; it was enough to pay for your education, and the most expensive articles of your clothing, until you were nearly eighteen. So you see, the most I have had to do for you, was to board and take care of you, as I would of an own child: this, I promised your mother I would do, and so I will, until you marry and have a home of your own. But Blanche,' proceeded my aunt, 'it won't do for you to refuse <emph>everybody,</emph> if you mean to marry at all; for in a few years, your chances won't be so plenty.'</p> 
               <p>"'I mean to change my situation very soon, so as no longer to be a burthen to you, aunt,' I said, 'but not by means of marriage; indeed, I have almost made up my mind <emph>never</emph> to marry.' Nettie, I wish you could have seen the astonished expression on aunt's face when I said this.</p> 
               <pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC5768-00000175"/> 
               <p>"'Blanche, are you crazy?' she exclaimed; 'you cannot be in earnest!'</p> 
               <p>"'I never was more so in my life,' I said; 'at all events, I shall not marry for several years to come; and any man that would not marry a young lady of twenty-five or over, (providing, of course, his own age was suitable.) as soon as one just escaped from her teens, would not suit me; so I shall not despair of obtaining a husband to <emph>my taste</emph> as easily some years hence as now, should I then be disposed to marry. But aunt,' I continued, (for I was anxious to return to our former subject), 'what was done with my mother's clothing? I really should like to see something she had worn-you took charge of it, of course, did you not?'</p> 
               <p>"'Of course I did,' she replied, 'and brought all with me that was worth making over for you, the rest I gave away to some poor people who had been in your mother's service. I have had about everything made up for you at one time or another, but there is a trunk, containing a few things, in the garret, that you can look at when you have leisure, and dispose of as you please. I should have mentioned it to you before had I not quite forgotten all about it. You won't find anything very valuable in it, I presume.'</p> 
               <p>"During the whole of this conversation, Nettie, I do not think my aunt once looked me full in the face, nor did she appear at all at ease in her manner. This I thought strangely of, for she is not easily disconcerted. Knowing her to be an artful woman, I began to think it possible she had not told me the exact truth; and I remembered that whenever<pb n=""/> uncle Langly had visited her, they had held long conversations, apparently of a private nature, together; and that, on two or three occasions, when I had passed near or into the room where they were seated, unexpectedly, I had heard my own name mentioned."</p> 
               <p>"But have you never examined the trunk?" asked Nettie, who had been a deeply attentive listener.</p> 
               <p>"Yes," replied Miss Rathbone, "I obtained the key from aunt and opened it yesterday afternoon. It contained a few printed muslin and crape dresses, also a pair of sleeves and a waist, of elegant green satin, which immediately brought to mind an apron that I had seen my aunt wear, when I was quite a little girl. I have always remembered the apron, from the fact, I suppose, that in my childish eyes, it was the most beautiful thing in the world. Then there was a large work-bag, full of bits and pieces, among which I found a very small roll of tea-colored, figured silk, corresponding exactly with a dress that was manufactured for Kate a few years ago, out of what aunt had called an old-fashioned dress of her own. The trunk also contained several pairs of slightly worn shoes, too small to have been of any service to aunt Belton, and now too old style to be of use to either Kate or myself; several pairs of knit cotton, and linen hose, marked M. R., a roll of old linen, and quite a number of books. While engaged in this examination, I was informed that uncle Langly had arrived, and my aunt wished me to superintend the getting of supper.</p> 
               <p>"As I had not examined the books at all, I filled my apron<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC5768-00000176"/> with them and carried them to my room, in order to look them over at my leisure.</p> 
               <p>"As soon after tea as possible, I hastened up stairs and arranged my newly-found treasures. This done to my satisfaction, I took a volume of poetry from among them, and seated myself at my little table, for the purpose of reading some passages that, during my cursory examination of the book, I had observed were marked with pencil, I suppose by the hand of my mother. I had not yet opened the book, when it accidentally slipped from my hand to the floor, and at the same time a letter, with a broken seal, fell from between its leaves. The letter was addressed to Mrs. Minerva Rathbone, and dated nearly twenty years back.</p> 
               <p>"I need not tell you, Nettie, with what interest I looked upon this relic of the past, or with what avidity I sought to acquaint myself with its contents. I need not tell you this, for you can easily imagine the eagerness with which I would naturally seize upon anything connected with a mother of whom I knew so little. But Nettie, you will be as much surprised as I was, when I tell you that this time-eaten letter, accidentally discovered, and, in all probability, accidentally or rather providentially preserved, has thrown more light upon the past, as connected with my mother and the period of my infancy than all I have ever been able to glean from any other source. But I will let the letter speak for itself, if you will light your lamp; the twilight is almost too dim for my eyes." Nettie quickly complied with this request. Blanche then drew the letter from her pocket, and the friends<pb n=""/> proceeded to read such portions of it as were legible. While they are thus employed, we will transcribe the letter for our readers.</p>

                           <p>"MY DEAR MINERVA-I am exceedingly grieved to learn from -- -- that your health has become so much impaired, and earnestly hope your sickness may prove less dangerous than you now appear to imagine may be restored to your usual health. Still I feel that you must be quite ill, from the fact that your letter (to which I now reply) was written by another's hand. You speak of death as very near; now, my dear cousin, has not the despondency which has weighed upon your spirits since your husband's death, unfitted you to judge with correctness in this matter? may you not be mistaken? Oh! I will hope that you are; for, though hundreds of miles now lie between us, I should feel as if a cherished friend was taken from my very side, should your worst suspicions be realized. [...] You seem to be uncertain what disposition to make of little Blanche, in case of your death; and say you would gladly commit her to my charge, were I differently situated. My dear Minerva, I am sure I need not tell you how willingly I would endeavor to supply, as far as possible, a mother's place, to the only child of so dear a had my matrimonial connection been more fortunate. As it is, (I blush as I write it), I could not hope that your little one would receive even friendly treatment from my husband and<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC5768-00000177"/> step-children; and certainly, the example of the latter (over whom I have no control) would not be such as either you or I would willingly sub ... say your half sister Mrs. Belton has ... willing to undertake the charge; and you doubt not she would treat the poor babe kindly, although she has a child of her own, only a few months younger than Blanche, as she already appears exceedingly fond of her. Mrs. Belton, you say, is naturally indolent, and therefore you do not like to burden her with such a charge; that she is so worldly-minded, you fear her influence over your child; and yet, you say, you know of no other person, in any way connected with your child, who would be willing to undertake the responsibility, and to whom you would venture to intrust her, excepting myself, and one other, who (like your unfortunate cousin) is so situated as to be unable to render you this service.</p> 
                           <p>"You ask what course I think you ought to take in this matter. Indeed, my dear cousin, I dare not... Of Mrs. Belton I know little or nothing. You will remember, that she continued to reside with the uncle who took her in charge at her mother's death, <emph>after</emph> her father's second marriage; consequently, I had no opportunity of meeting her, until I met her as Mrs. Belton, on the evening of your marriage. I ... her ... very handsome, but not remarkably intelligent. I could not decide, I remember, upon her disposition. I <emph>think,</emph> however, if I were you, I should not hesitate to commit my child to her, through any fear of making <emph>her</emph> trouble; for, as she has recently been left a widow, with only a very scanty support, I presume your doing so<pb n=""/> would be considered less a trouble than a favor; for the large legacy you have recently received, will enable you to pay Mrs. Belton well for her trouble, and any extra expense that she may be at on your child's account, and still leave sufficient for your daughter's future maintenance. As Mrs. Belton is situated, I presume she would be glad to undertake the charge; and her recent afflictions, perhaps, may her to think less of the vanities of time, than formerly what I think of appointing Mr. Langley guardian! You know we are not at all acquainted; but, if you can place confidence in him, I suppose he would do better than a stranger. I hope, however, your recovery will render a ...</p>

               <p>Nettie was surprised by the contents of this letter, even more than Blanche had been; although herself and mother had frequently thought it very singular that Mrs. Belton should appear so adverse to speaking of her niece's early parents, and her history, if all was as it should be.</p> 
               <p>"What course do you intend pursuing, Blanche?" she said, after having repeatedly expressed her surprise.</p> 
               <p>"I cannot tell, until I have the benefit of your advice;" returned Blanche. "I really dread taking <emph>any</emph> step in the matter; for it would mortify and frighten aunt not a little, to learn I had discovered what she has been so anxious to conceal, especially when that discovery would prove her both unjust and dishonorable. This letter," continued Miss Rathbone<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC5768-00000178"/> bone, "has convinced me the legacy, my aunt confessed to my mother's receiving during her last sickness, was much larger than she represented it to be, and cannot yet have been expended, at least by fair means. I am rejoiced to find I have not been dependent upon my aunt," continued Miss Rathbone, "and am anxious she should know I understand it, but really dislike mentioning the subject to her myself."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps it is some business connected with this legacy, that has brought your uncle Langly to town just now," suggested Nettie. "You know to-morrow will make you twenty-one?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes."</p> 
               <p>"It <emph>may</emph> be," resumed Nettie, "your uncle and aunt will conclude it best to deal honestly with you for the future; and to-morrow, it being your twenty-first birth-day, may speak of the matter themselves; if they do not, suppose you put your uncle some unexpected questions, and watch their effect upon him; he <emph>may</emph> not be as artful as his sister. Whatever you do," she added, "I think should be done soon."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I suppose so," returned Miss Rathbone, musingly. "If one only knew what steps to take. I hope uncle will broach the matter himself; if he does not, I believe I will follow your advice, and ask him a question or two."</p> 
               <p>"I am sorry that we cannot make out the whole signature to the letter," said Nettie; "for, if we only could, you might write to the lady, who, if still living, might be able to furnish you with further information on this subject."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"But even then, a letter might not reach her," answered Blanche; "for it is twenty years nearly, since this letter was written, you must remember; and supposing the lady to be still alive, (which I think unlikely, considering how she was circumstanced,) it is hardly possible she still resides in Detroit; indeed, the letter, as far as we have been able to decipher it, does not state that to be her place of residence; she <emph>may</emph> have been there only on a visit you know, when the letter was written."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, but there is nothing like trying: we cannot say she could not be found there; but, as the signature is almost wholly destroyed, I suppose there will be no use in speculating further on that point. I wish the moths had spared her name, at least."</p> 
               <p>"I do too; but as they have not, I think I can do no better at present, than to try and glean something from uncle, before he leaves. I must hasten home now," continued Miss Rathbone, "for it is getting late."</p> 
               <p>"Do you wish me to say nothing of this affair to mother?" asked Nettie.</p> 
               <p>"Certainly not; relate to her as much of it as you can; and to-morrow, if nothing occurs to prevent, I will call again, and obtain (if possible) her advice."</p>

               <p>WHEN Blanche reached home, she discovered that Mr. Beesley was in the parlor, and not caring to see him, she proceeded quietly up stairs to her own room. After striking a light, and removing her hat and shawl, she took up one of the books that had been her mother's, and commenced reading; but finding the room uncomfortably cold, she repaired into an adjoining apartment, which was usually occupied by her cousin and herself, during the winter season. This apartment was situated directly above the family sitting-room, and was rendered comfortable by means of a stove-pipe, which passed through it from below. Near this pipe, Blanche now seated herself, but had hardly re-opened her book, before she heard the sound of voices (which she easily recognized as belonging to her aunt and uncle,) in very earnest conversation in the room below. There had evidently been a pause in their discourse, for, though Miss Rathbone's light footsteps gave back no sound, as they fell upon the carpeted floor, no murmur of voices met her ear, but now every word uttered was distinctly heard without effort on her part, although the<pb n=""/> tones were not loud. The aperture surrounding the pipe, however, was somewhat larger than necessity required, thereby affording an ample channel for the communication of sound.</p> 
               <p>"Where is Blanche to-night?" were the first words that were spoken below, after Blanche had entered the room and seated herself as described.</p> 
               <p>"I don't know," answered Mrs. Belton; "she didn't trouble herself to tell me where she was going; I s'pose she has gone to Carrol's though, for she's there almost every day of her life."</p> 
               <p>"Then you think she has not returned?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, for I havn't heard her come in yet, and if she <emph>was</emph> home, she would be up in her room as usual, and not at all likely to hear us."</p> 
               <p>Blanche now felt somewhat ashamed of her present position, and began to think if she remained longer, she should be no better than a wilful 'eaves-dropper.' Propriety, she thought, required her to leave the room; and she was (though reluctantly,) preparing to do so, when something seemed to whisper in her ear, that self-justice equally demanded her stay.</p> 
               <p>"This may be your only opportunity of learning the truth," it seemed to say; "it is right that you should know it! Will not the end to be gained, excuse the means?"</p> 
               <p>Blanche, dear reader, was but mortal, like yourselves, and us; and therefore, liable to err; but pray remember, we are not committing ourselves, by saying we approve of her decision in this matter, because, in the character of an honest<pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC5768-00000180"/> historian, we state this circumstance, and say that, right or wrong, Blanche listened to the whisperer, that bade her remain.</p> 
               <p>Miss Rathbone closed her book, for she did not now feel inclined to read, and the next sentence she heard, drove all thoughts of doing so, from her mind.</p> 
               <p>"What do you suppose put it into that silly girl's head, to ask you such questions?" inquired Mr. Langly. "You certainly have not been so imprudent as to 'let fall' anything calculated to arouse her suspicions, have you?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly not, brother! I'm a little too old for <emph>that</emph> I guess. But I declare I <emph>never</emph> was <emph>more</emph> beat in my life, than when she pushed me so for a direct answer. I think I got along though, pretty well, considering how sudden it came on me; I had to think fast, for once, I can tell you. I knew that she couldn't really <emph>know</emph> anything about the matter, so when I found I'd got to tell her something, I fixed out a story to suit myself, and one that I thought you would approve of."</p> 
               <p>"You did first rate," returned the brother; "I always thought you a famous manager. You contrived to tell some truths too, for her father <emph>did</emph> run through all of his property, <emph>that's</emph> so; and fifty hundred dollars <emph>are</emph> few, compared with larger sums. Do you suppose she believed your statements?"</p> 
               <p>"At first, I was afraid she did not; for she never took her eyes off of me, while I was speaking: I <emph>knew</emph> it, though I don't think I looked her in the eye once; I was afraid if I did, she might read more than I would like. She has the keenest eyes I ever saw, anyway, and they are so awful black<pb n=""/> too, that it makes me feel uncomfortable whenever she fixes them on my face. She has acted about as usual, since our conversation, however, so I rather think she was satisfied with my story."</p> 
               <p>"I <emph>hope</emph> so," responded Langly, with earnestness.</p> 
               <p>"I declare, Charles," continued Mrs. Belton, "I sometimes wish we had been rich enough to have let the child have all that belonged to her, after paying ourselves for her board and our trouble, though to be sure she didn't need so much, and her mother ought to have willed at least half of it to us, for now that she has grown up, I am in such constant fear she will find us out, in some way, that I almost wish we had never seen either Blanche or her money."</p> 
               <p>"Now you talk like a silly woman," returned her brother, impatiently; "what chance do you suppose there is of her <emph>ever</emph> finding us out? didn't we look after that from the first? she has no relations in the world that would be able to give her <emph>any</emph> information on the subject, beside us. The lawyer that drew up the will for her mother, you know, is dead, and the will you saw destroyed with your own eyes, on the very day that we succeeded in getting it into our possession; so what are you scared about?-wish we had never seen her or her money either, indeed! I don't care how much you wish we had never seen <emph>her,</emph> but I should just like to know how you or I either would have managed without her <emph>money;</emph> you know very well I lost almost everything I had by that scoundrel Merrit, and wouldn't have had hardly a cent towards commencing business again, if it hadn't been for that legacy.<pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC5768-00000181"/> (what a lucky thing it was that it was all in hard cash.) As for you, didn't your husband leave you with hardly enough to pay his funeral expenses, and rig you out in black? and wouldn't you have been obliged to work like any other poor woman, if it hadn't been for this money? for of course I couldn't have helped you without it, as I was situated; and didn't it buy this house? Pshaw, Sarah, don't trouble yourself any more about it, for no one hardly knew anything about Minerva's legacy, she received it such a short time before her death; but suppose there were a good many knowing to it, and they were still alive, they wouldn't be very apt to trouble themselves in the matter, at this late day. If you lived in or near the place where Blanche's mother resided, there <emph>might</emph> be a <emph>little</emph> danger, but where you are I cannot see any at all."</p> 
               <p>"I hope in all conscience there isn't!" exclaimed Mrs. Belton.</p> 
               <p>"I'll tell you what I'll do," continued Langly, "if it will ease your conscience any, I will give Blanche an equal outfit with Kate, on her marriage; and if she behaves herself well, I'll will her three or four hundreds besides; that would be <emph>generous</emph> enough, would it not?" This remark was followed by a low laugh, in which Mrs. Belton joined.</p> 
               <p>"If we were to do any better by her than that," said the lady, "Blanche would have reason to think we considered her claim upon us pretty strong, and you know we have taken pains to have her think the contrary. She has always made herself very useful to me," continued Mrs. Belton, "and I<pb n=""/> can't help liking her, though she is so different from Kate. I sincerely hope she may never come to want."</p> 
               <p>"The sooner you get the girls married, the better," said Mr. Langly, "only don't marry them both in the same year, for it might draw on my purse strings a little too hard, if they wanted their outfits too near together. When they are once married, you can sell this place and put the avails out for your personal benefit, and make your home for the future with one or the other of the girls, or if you would like it better, you can keep house for your old bachelor brother. O, what did Blanche say after she had examined that old trunk? are you sure there was nothing in it that could tell tales?"</p> 
               <p>"Perfectly certain," answered the sister; "I looked it through and through, before I ever gave her the key; there was nothing left in it but a few books and a few old dresses, some high-heeled shoes, and a work-sack full of old bits and pieces, and such like. You see I haven't used anything out of <emph>that</emph> trunk since Blanche was a little thing, excepting that tea-colored silk that was made over for Kate, and I was careful, at the same time, to secure all the pieces; and as I told both Kate and her cousin that it was an old dress of my own, I don't think Blanche will find <emph>that</emph> out."</p> 
               <p>"Did she evince any disappointment on finding so little in the trunk?"</p> 
               <p>"No, none at all, but she seemed wonderfully pleased with her books; I see she has lugged them all down to her room. I wonder why she don't come home, it's high time she was in; I don't like her being at Carrol's so much."</p> 
               <pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC5768-00000182"/> 
               <p>"Beesley hasn't gone yet, has he?" inquired Mr. Langly.</p> 
               <p>"No, not yet; I don't see why he don't propose; he's been just on the point, this four months past and I'm sure has had chance enough to see Kate alone. I don't see what he means."</p> 
               <p>The almost breathless listener now arose from her seat, and noiselessly left the room. She had but just placed her light on her table, and seated herself beside it; not to read, but to compose her agitated feelings, and as calmly as possible review in her mind the conversation she had just overheard, when she distinguished the sound of footsteps upon the stairs. Hastily opening the book, which was still in her hand, Blanche bent over it as if deeply absorbed in its contents, when the door opened and her aunt looked into the room.</p> 
               <p>"O you are here, are you?" said Mrs. Belton, pleasantly, "I thought I would come up and see if you had come home, before I shut up the house. Mr. Beesley will be going soon I expect. Have you been in the parlor, my dear?"</p> 
               <p>"No, aunt, I found that Mr. Beesley was there, so I thought I would not disturb him and Kate, but would come up here and read a little."</p> 
               <p>"You have been at Mr. Carrol's, I 'spose, how is Mrs. Carrol?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, ma'am, I have been there. Mrs. Carrol and the family are comfortably well."</p> 
               <p>"Isn't this room too cold for you to sit in now?" continued Mrs. Belton, "you are looking pale, I'm afraid you have taken cold."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"I guess not, but it <emph>is rather</emph> cold here," returned Blanche; "Kate and I will feel inclined to change our quarters soon, if this weather continues."</p> 
               <p>"It won't be cold so long," returned Mrs. Belton, "for we have got to have our Indian summer yet, you know. But you had better not sit up in the cold any longer, my dear," she added.</p> 
               <p>"I'm going directly to bed," said Blanche.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Belton then left the room.</p>

               <p>SOON after breakfast, on the following morning, Blanche went out, ostensibly for a walk, but her real object was to seek an interview with Mrs. Carrol and Nettie, to whom she hastened to communicate the event of the preceding night.</p> 
               <p>"It is but little I care about the money," she continued, "but it is hard to be defrauded of my rights, and then treated as a dependent; I cannot willingly submit to this, and yet I cannot tell what course I ought to take. Mrs. Carrol what <emph>shall</emph> I do?"</p> 
               <p>"I really do not know what advice to give you," replied<pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC5768-00000183"/> Mrs. Carrol; "you certainly should have what is your own, and are now old enough to claim it in your own name. If you make your discovery known to your aunt and uncle, it could not fail of placing you on a more independent footing for the future, even though by one pretext or another they should succeed in keeping you from the possession of what may remain of your property. I suppose the most correct course you could take, would be to testify to what you have heard, bring forward the letter as corroborative proof, and claim the assistance of the law."</p> 
               <p>"But mother, the signature of the letter is incomplete, you remember," said Nettie, "would not that fact prevent its being accepted as proof?"</p> 
               <p>"I know the signature is only in part legible," replied Nettie's mother, "but in the present instance, I should not think that circumstance would have much weight, for the evident age of the letter would account for such a defect, and also prove it no forgery, invented for the occasion. Still, I think I should prefer trying other measures before seeking legal assistance."</p> 
               <p>"O! I could not think of carrying this thing into court, even if I was certain of gaining my suit!" exclaimed Miss Rathbone. "I would not subject my aunt and cousin to the intense mortification the making public of such an affair would occasion them, for all there is at stake. If uncle Langly alone was implicated in this transaction, I should not hesitate, that is, if I could see before me a prospect of success, for I believe he has been the instigator of this treachery."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"I have no doubt of it," said Nettie, "but I think he found a very willing abettor in his sister; still, I do not blame you for disliking to proceed to legal action, and I think with mother, it would be better to try other means first."</p> 
               <p>"I do not think it would do any good to try the law at all," returned Blanche, "for it would be almost impossible to prove my claim. My aunt and uncle, in the first place, might see fit to deny the conversation I overheard, and challenge me for proof, which I could not produce; then, all that would remain for me to build upon, would be the ancient letter, and that does not give in round numbers the amount of the legacy."</p> 
               <p>"I have just been thinking of that," said Mrs. Carrol, "and also, that the <emph>letter</emph> did not prove that your uncle was more than spoken of as your guardian. And then, you do not know of any person or persons, aside from your aunt and uncle, who had any positive knowledge of the legacy; that is, any whose testimony you have the means of obtaining; and as the will is destroyed, and consequently cannot be produced, I confess I cannot see that the wrong would stand much chance of being righted by an appeal to the law, at least under present circumstances. I <emph>may</emph> not be correct, however, for I do not profess to understand the law; you are better acquainted with it than either Nettie or myself."</p> 
               <p>"I know but very little of it, on such points at least," said Blanche, "no more, probably, than yourself or daughter; but my <emph>opinion</emph> corresponds with yours. How do you think it would answer," she continued, "to let the matter drop until<pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC5768-00000184"/> after my uncle's departure, and then, informing my aunt of what has come to my knowledge, allowing her to <emph>suppose</emph> that, in case my claim was disputed by her and my uncle, I should seek legal assistance; but otherwise, was willing to compromise to almost any extent, rather than make the affair public? <emph>I</emph> think in such a case she would confess all. What would you think of such an arrangement, Mrs. Carroll?"</p> 
               <p>"It would answer as well, perhaps, as any you could adopt," replied Mrs. Carrol. "But I would not," she proceeded, "so much as hint to my aunt, were I in your place, that I did not consider myself sufficiently supplied with proof to substantiate my claim, or allow her to know the extent of my knowledge. By adopting this course, I think it quite possible you might draw out a good deal of information from her, that you would not otherwise be likely to obtain."</p> 
               <p>"You might, perhaps, learn the entire name of your mother's correspondent, and her place of residence, (if still living,)" suggested Nettie, "and many other things that might serve as a clue to the future unravelling of this affair, should your aunt's or uncle's continued injustice provoke you to a legal investigation."</p> 
               <p>"I hardly think any ill treatment would induce me to take such a step, Nettie," returned Miss Rathbone, "for I would much rather suffer wrong than be instrumental in bringing public reproach and disgrace upon those with whom I have passed nearly all of my life, however much they may deserve it."</p> 
               <p>"I am glad to see you so much disposed to render good<pb n=""/> for evil, my dear," said Mrs. Carrol, "it is certainly the most glorious revenge. You must act as you think best in this matter," she added, "and we will hope that all may yet be amicably settled."</p>

               <p>WHILE Blanche was holding the interview with Mrs. Carrol and Nettie, described in the preceding chapter, Mrs. Belton and Kate were engaged in a conversation that did not appear to be quite agreeable to the younger lady.</p> 
               <p>"Kate, did Mr. Beesley propose last night?" interrogated Mrs. Belton.</p> 
               <p>"No, mother, not <emph>quite,</emph>" answered Miss Belton.</p> 
               <p>"Not <emph>quite,</emph>" repeated the mother, rather unpleasantly; "pray how long do you intend letting him dangle on at this rate?-why don't you bring him to the point?"</p> 
               <p>"Why, how <emph>can</emph> I mother? I have received his attentions graciously; what more can I do? I can't <emph>make</emph> him propose, you know."</p> 
               <p>"Yes you can too, if you only have a little contrivance<pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC5768-00000185"/> about you, and he really wants you; there are ways enough. I'll warrant if it had been my case, I'd of had the thing settled one way or the other long ago. Do you think he is really attached to you?"</p> 
               <p>"La-yes ma' I <emph>know</emph> he is."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps he wants encouragement then; have you ever given him much?"</p> 
               <p>"Not a great deal, for <emph>you</emph> said it wouldn't do to be too fast-and that if I acted a little offish once in a while, it would make a lover all the more anxious to get me."</p> 
               <p>"I gave that, as a <emph>general</emph> rule," returned the mother, pettishly; "but all such rules admit of exceptions, and you ought to have wit enough to know <emph>when</emph> the exceptions should be made. Now, if you have never given Mr. Beesley reason to suppose his attachment was returned, he may think the proper time for making a proposal, with a prospect of success, has not yet arrived. I should advise you, at this juncture, to let him see that you are not indifferent to him; this you can accomplish without appearing in the least conscious of doing so. You can study his tastes in your dress, and flatter his vanity by consulting him upon various subjects; by adopting his opinions, and following his advice; and by appearing to think him possessed of <emph>uncommon</emph> judgment and taste,-you may also, <emph>occasionally,</emph> when the conversation is such as to admit of it, let fall, as if inadvertently, a word or so, expressive of regard; not <emph>too</emph> pointed however, or he will think it the frankness of friendship only, as love is supposed to be more bashful. Such a course could hardly fail of<pb n=""/> bringing him to the point, if encouragement is all that is wanting."</p> 
               <p>"But suppose he shouldn't propose then, I couldn't do anything more, could I?"</p> 
               <p>"Mercy! yes; you could speak of Mr. Lawrence, for instance, in the highest terms, and say that the more you saw of him the better you liked him, and that you never had supposed you should find so much to admire in his character, as you had done since you had been thrown so much in his society. Then you could contrive to be seen out with him occasionally, which would show Beesley that while he was making up his mind, another might step in and carry off the prize. But if this shouldn't bring him to, there would be still another resort left."</p> 
               <p>"What can it be, mother? I can't think for my life."</p> 
               <p>"I will tell you, child. If worse comes to worst, you can tell him plainly, that, though personally you have no objection to receiving his attentions and frequent visits, and have never supposed they were intended to be anything more than friendly in their nature, yet, as others had decided otherwise, and as reports of your supposed engagement were becoming very common, you thought it better (as no such thing was in contemplation between you) that you should see him less frequently. Tell him, that it is usually considered an injury to a young lady to be reported engaged, when nothing of the kind exists, as it prevents other gentlemen from treating her with anything more than the most common courtesy, through fear of interfering with the supposed lover's rights; and that<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC5768-00000186"/> in consequence, she becomes almost entirely dependent upon him for attention: and that for this, and <emph>other</emph> reasons that you cannot bring yourself to mention, you have concluded it would be better for you to be less in his society for the future. Assure him that no want of friendly feeling on <emph>your</emph> part had induced you to take this step, as you never had regarded him <emph>more</emph> highly; and that you regretted much, that anything should render it necessary for you to deprive yourself of the pleasure of his society. If the man has any idea of marrying you at all, he will immediately declare himself, should matters come to this pass; if he has none, and is only flirting, the sooner he is off the better."</p> 
               <p>"Dear-me-mother, I'd rather never have him, than go to such a parade! I don't like him well enough to put myself to all <emph>that</emph> trouble! If he don't offer himself of his own accord, he may <emph>go,</emph> for all I care; I guess there's a plenty of fish in the sea yet; only let me bait 'em, and I reckon they'll bite fast enough. Beesley may go, if he chooses to."</p> 
               <p>"Kate, how like a silly child you talk! You know you are as determined to marry, as I am to have you; for you have been too well brought up to think of such a thing as being an old maid. I know there are plenty of fish IN the sea, but the great thing is, to have a good one OUT. Now you have already refused two tolerably good offers, in hopes of getting Beesley, so I wouldn't give <emph>him</emph> up, unless obliged to: he is rich and handsome, and well worth trying pretty hard for; he is fashionable too, and so just the man to suit you. But it won't do for you to let him hang on as you have<pb n=""/> done; you must bring him up to the mark as quickly as possible, or you may lose him after all: I have an idea he is getting to like Blanche."</p> 
               <p>"O pshaw, mother!"</p> 
               <p>"It's <emph>so,</emph> Kate; not that I think he prefers her to you, or would think of marrying her, (for she is too bookish to suit him for a wife,) but he may soon get to thinking just enough of her to divert his mind from you. I hope, Kate, you will endeavor to find out what your prospects are in that quarter, very soon; for, if Beesley is 'no go,' we want to know it in time to secure Mr. Lawrence, if possible. I see Lawrence is a good deal taken with you now, and I think will answer for you very well, if we cannot fasten Beesley."</p> 
               <p>"But ma, I don't like Mr. Lawrence."</p> 
               <p>"Nonsense, child! love is necessary to marriage only in novels, in real life it isn't essential at all; nobody hardly marries for love now-a-days; that is among fashionable people, except such poor fools as Bella Crawford."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>She</emph> married for romance," interrupted Kate.</p> 
               <p>"Well, love or romance, either, call it what you like, it's all the same," returned Mrs. Belton. "I think marriage a good deal happier without it," she proceeded; "for then one doesn't mind every little slight. If a man isn't positively disagreeable to you that's enough; you will like him fast enough when you have made up your mind to have him; that is, as much as you would be likely to, after you had been married awhile, if you had oceans of love to begin with.</p> 
               <p>"But wasn't you in love when you married, mother?"</p> 
               <pb n="380-381" xml:id="VAC5768-00000187"/> 
               <p>"No-I <emph>liked</emph> your father well enough, but I never was what is called in love with him, in the world; and we got along about as well as most people I reckon-we had a spat once in awhile to be sure, (for your father hadn't the pleasantest disposition in the world,) but I presume we should have had ten where we had one, if we had been much in love with each other. Dear me! if you wait for such moonshine as falling in love, it's ten to one you'll live to be an old maid in spite of yourself; for the person <emph>you</emph> might fancy, might not fancy <emph>you</emph> at all. I declare, Kate, I <emph>do</emph> hope you will get such an old-fashioned notion out of your head immediately; I don't know what I <emph>should</emph> do, if you were to disappoint me after all, by leading a single life."</p> 
               <p>"No danger mother, for I have no such idea. But if <emph>some</emph> love isn't necessary, why do they promise to love one another when they are being married?"</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Belton rubbed her hands across her forehead twice or thrice, before she answered.</p> 
               <p>"They don't say they do love <emph>then,</emph>" she replied; "but, that they <emph>will;</emph> that is, <emph>after</emph> they are married; and so they will, if they <emph>can.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps they can't," suggested Kate.</p> 
               <p>"Well, if they <emph>try</emph> to, and can't, I don't know who's to blame," replied Mrs. Belton.</p> 
               <p>"You were left a widow so young, mother, and were so handsome, too, I often wonder you did not marry again," said Kate; "especially as you are such a friend to matrimony."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I was young, and handsome enough, certainly," returned<pb n=""/> turned the mother; "but as there was no necessity of my taking such a step, I thought that I would not give you a step-father: besides, your uncle Langly did not wish me to marry again, as he was single, and promised if I would not he would see me well provided for through life."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Langly now entered the room, and the conversation between the mother and daughter was not continued.</p>

               <p>EARLY on the following morning Mr. Langly took his departure, and soon after Blanche found herself alone with her aunt, Kate having gone out on a shopping excursion with Flotilla Crawford.</p> 
               <p>Thinking it a good opportunity for broaching the subject now uppermost in her mind, she resolved to improve it.</p> 
               <p>"Aunt Belton," she began, in quiet tones, looking up from her work to her aunt's face, as she spoke; "do you know where my mother's cousin Martha is now?"</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Belton started as if from an electric shock. "What-what-do you mean?" she stammered; "what cousin Martha? who told you your mother had a cousin Martha?"</p> 
               <p>"No one," answered Blanche; "I have a letter from her."</p> 
               <p>"You a letter from Martha Landon! impossible! why-<pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC5768-00000188"/> I thought-I thought-I supposed she was-dead long ago!" and Mrs. Belton's cheeks became as hueless as the snowy collar that surrounded her throat.</p> 
               <p>"What did she write to you about?" she continued; "how did she know where you were? It's impossible, she did not write you; you are telling me falsehoods."</p> 
               <p>"No aunt, not wilfully," returned Blanche with mildness, for she really pitied her aunt; "I did not say the letter was addressed to <emph>me,</emph> but that I had one in my possession. The letter was written to my own mother, twenty years ago, and was left (I presume accidentally) in one of her books; I prize it very highly, although it is a good deal moth-eaten and faded,-so much so as to be in some parts entirely unreadable; perhaps you would like to hear it? I will read it to you;" and without waiting for an answer, Blanche drew the letter from her pocket, and had read it nearly through, omitting only those passages wherein mention was made of Mrs. Belton's worldly character, when it was suddenly snatched from her hand, and before she could prevent it, the letter was blazing in the fire: and her aunt stood before her, defiance in every look.</p> 
               <p>Blanche hardly knew whether surprise or anger was uppermost in her heart. Controlling herself as much as possible, she rose from her chair, and placed herself between her aunt and the door.</p> 
               <p>"Aunt Belton," she asked, with as much calmness as she could command, "why did you destroy that letter? what had I done to provoke such a malicious act on your part?"</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Because you wanted to ruin me with it. You wanted to prove by it that you had more property left you than we ever told you about! but you hadn't, no such thing-the letter's a lie from beginning to end! Martha Landon didn't know anything about it at all-I'd like to see her old letter do you any good <emph>now!</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Aunt Belton, compose yourself and listen to me," said Miss Rathbone, in a calm but firm voice. At this, Mrs. Belton's anger seemed to give way to mortification, or fear; for she immediately sunk into an arm-chair that was standing near her, and covered her face with her hands.</p> 
               <p>"Listen to me for one moment," continued Blanche. "In the first place I wish to assure you, that if you are disposed to comply with the proposition I intend making you, you need fear no harm from me. I would also assure you, that you have effected nothing by destroying the letter; for it has been seen, and perused by Nettie Carrol, who, as well as myself, could testify as to its contents; and your destroying it, would certainly indicate guilt, and operate against you in a judicial court. But you must not suppose my knowledge of matters is confined to what could be obtained from that letter, for you could not make a greater mistake. From <emph>other</emph> sources I have learned that my mother's legacy amounted to five thousand dollars in ready money, that she left a will, and that <emph>that</emph> will was last in uncle Langly's possession. I also-" Blanche stopped short; for Mrs. Belton's hand dropped from her face, and her head sunk upon her bosom: she had fainted. Blanche hastened to her side, and in a<pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC5768-00000189"/> short time succeeded in restoring her to animation. When Mrs. Belton looked up, and beheld the anxious and tearful face that was bending over her, she quickly reclosed her eyes, and then the large tears forced their way from between their jetty lashes, and her bosom heaved convulsively. Blanche reproached herself severely for her precipitancy, and actually felt as if <emph>she,</emph> instead of her aunt, was the guilty party; and for a moment, she wished she had confined the knowledge of her discovery to her own bosom.</p> 
               <p>"Dear aunt," she exclaimed, "forgive me for breaking this news to you so abruptly! I meant to save your feelings as much as possible, but I have not succeeded as I had hoped; but, dear aunt, you certainly know that what I have stated is the truth: but I will say no more on this subject now, unless you wish it, except to assure you that it is <emph>not</emph> my intention to make this matter public, by consulting the lawyer, or in any other way, unless you and your brother render such a course on <emph>my</emph> part necessary. Let me persuade you to lie down now," she continued, affectionately, "and perhaps after you have obtained a little rest, you will feel better able to listen to the propositions I wish to make you."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Blanche, I don't deserve so much kindness from you!" sobbed the unhappy woman. "You don't know all, not <emph>all</emph> yet. O I shall die!-what will my brother say!-what shall I do!-what <emph>shall</emph> I do!" and poor Mrs. Belton wrung her hands, and sobbed aloud.</p> 
               <p>"Compose yourself, my dear aunt, do not-"</p> 
               <p>"Don't call <emph>me</emph> your dear aunt!" interrupted Mrs. Belton<pb n=""/> ton, "I <emph>can't</emph> be dear to you <emph>now,</emph> and it's all mockery to call me so. But where did you get so much news?" she continued, with sudden energy, her whole manner changing. "Who could have told you all of this?-you can't <emph>prove</emph> what you have said! you have been misinformed-<emph>somebody</emph> has been cheating you!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes aunt, I know very well I have been <emph>cheated,</emph> but not in the way <emph>you</emph> have mentioned. You wish to know how, and by whom, I obtained my information; now I am neither willing or obliged to answer this question at present, therefore you must excuse me; but this much I will tell you, I have recently learned much of what I have stated to you, through two persons who were acquainted with my mother, and who were also (I believe) somewhat related to her, both of whom are still living: I have not yet told you <emph>all</emph> that I obtained from them, but I am perfectly satisfied that their statements were correct. They <emph>can</emph> be brought upon the stand, if necessary, and are fully capable of testifying to the truth of their assertions. As I said before, however, I am not disposed to call in the aid of the law, and will not, if you and uncle Langly will do what is right <emph>now.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"What is it you wish us to do?-how <emph>can</emph> we do right <emph>now?</emph>-O dear!-O dear, I wish I'd never been born!-I <emph>shall</emph> go crazy!-I was always afraid it would come to this!-poor Kate, what will become of you now!-Blanche Rathbone, what is it you want us to do?" Such were the interrogations and exclamations that fell in rapid succession from the lips of the highly-excited woman.</p> 
               <pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC5768-00000190"/> 
               <p>"All I wish <emph>you</emph> to do now is, to tell me plainly what has become of my mother's will," said Blanche.</p> 
               <p>"I can't do it," returned Mrs. Belton; "I haven't got it-why didn't you ask your guardian about it, if you thought he had it?-how do you know there is any will?"</p> 
               <p>"I have no guardian," answered Blanche; "you forget that I am no longer a minor. I do not know that there <emph>is</emph> a will, but I understand perfectly well that there <emph>was</emph> one, and that uncle Langly obtained possession of it, and I believe you must know what disposition he has made of it."</p> 
               <p>Blanche had thought it best her aunt should have no reason to suspect the informants she had mentioned were no other than herself and brother; therefore, she carefully refrained from alluding to such portions of their conversation as would lead her to suppose it had been overheard.</p> 
               <p>"I presume," continued Blanche, (for Mrs. Belton had attempted no reply,) "I presume you and your brother supposed there were none in existence to tell me of the will; but notwithstanding every possible precaution may have been taken to prevent it, such things generally come out at last, and sometimes in a way least expected. I will leave you now," added Miss Rathbone, "and when you feel able to converse, and are ready to hear the proposals I intend making you, come up to my room, and we will talk the matter over in a friendly manner." Blanche now turned to leave the room.</p> 
               <p>"Stop-stop-Blanche!" exclaimed Mrs. Belton, "don't go yet; I will tell you all, and hear what you have to say<pb n=""/> 
                  <emph>now,</emph> for I can't live in this way much longer!-I must know the worst, and I can bear it now as well as any time." Mrs. Belton pointed to a chair as she finished.</p> 
               <p>Blanche immediately seated herself, and her aunt covering her eyes with her hand, proceeded to say,-</p> 
               <p>"Blanche what you have heard is all true, there <emph>was</emph> a will, but there is none now: you did have money left you, but we were very poor, and so had to use it; for we hardly knew which way to turn, in order to live at all. We supposed everybody was dead that knew anything about your mother's legacy but us, and we could use it without any body's being the wiser for it, especially if the will was destroyed, so your uncle burned it-but Blanche, we never meant to let you suffer; we always calculated to do for you as for an own child. At first, I didn't want any more of your money than was my due for boarding, and taking care of you; but Charles made me take enough to buy this place, and some new furniture, and the rest <emph>he</emph> took to commence business with again, for he had failed. You know your uncle had a right to <emph>use</emph> your money, for he was your guardian!"</p> 
               <p>"He has had no legal right to act as my guardian, without my consent, for several years past," returned Blanche; "for, if I remember correctly, the law allows a child to choose its own guardian at fifteen; but if such power had been his, he would have had no right to destroy the will or conceal its existence from me; and <emph>as</emph> my guardian, he is now responsible not only for all the money used by him, for other than my benefit, but also for lawful interest on the same."</p> 
               <pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC5768-00000191"/> 
               <p>"But he couldn't pay it if he wanted to ever so much," said Mrs. Belton, who had now become more composed, "at any rate, not without turning himself out of business, and Kate and me into the streets; for I have had as much as I could do to get enough out of him to meet our family expenses, for a year past; he says he is owing in New York, and that it will be six or eight months yet before he can get clear of debt. He saw I felt bad about our using your money," continued Mrs. Belton, "so he promised me he would make you out a few hundred dollars when you were disposed to marry, and would remember you in his will. We had no business to do as we did, I know, but we were very poor, and the devil tempted us I suppose. O dear! I never had anything make me feel so in my life-if you <emph>do</emph> make this thing public, Blanche, it will kill Kate and tempt me to put myself out of the world. O Blanche! won't you overlook it all and forgive us?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly, I'll forgive <emph>you,</emph> aunt," answered Blanche; whether I forgive your brother or not depends upon the course he takes in this matter; as for Kate, she need know no more of it than you choose to have her, at least not at present. I will tell you now," continued Miss Rathbone, "what I am willing to do; for your sake and Kate's, I will excuse the past, on this condition, that you write immediately to your brother, giving him a truthful account of what has passed between us, and telling him from me, that if he will give me a written promise, that within three years, he will deposit in some safe bank, for my benefit, the sum of one<pb n=""/> thousand dollars, and will pay me lawful interest on that amount, until such deposit shall have been made, and will also pledge himself to provide for you and Kate as usual, and allow me a home here as long as I may wish it; I will, on <emph>my</emph> part, promise to overlook the past, and investigate the matter no farther; but, that if he refuses to do this, he must abide the consequences. How do you like this proposition, aunt?"</p> 
               <p>"O! it is only too generous," answered Mrs. Belton, "we don't deserve so much kindness from <emph>you,</emph> of all persons. I will write to brother immediately, and I'm sure he'll comply with your terms at once; but if he won't, I will myself turn witness against him, and I'll tell him so in my letter. I <emph>know</emph> he'll be glad to get off so though, for only think what a sum, just the interest on five thousand dollars would amount to by this time, enough more than all you ever cost him, everything charged. O! he will comply-no danger."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Belton did write to her brother, and in a few days received a reply, expressive of much surprise and vexation, but agreeing with her in the opinion, that the wisest course they could <emph>now</emph> pursue, would be to accede at once to Blanche's proposition. Mr. Langly also addressed a note to Blanche, in which, after making a few lame apologies for his former injustice and treachery, he expressed himself as deeply grateful for the kindness and consideration she had manifested towards himself and sister, and promised that her request should be complied with "to the letter."</p>

               <p>PATIENT reader, seven years have come and gone since the occurrence of the events we last attempted describing to you, and we trust you will not weary, though we invite you once more to accompany us in fancy to the beautiful village of Elville. Few were the changes that had taken place in the outward appearance of the village, during the lapse of time mentioned, but such could not be said of the circle comprising our acquaintances, for many a change had entered there.</p> 
               <p>For three years Mrs. Champell has been sleeping in her grave; in a twelvemonth after her death, her disconsolate partner left Elville for a foreign shore, in search of that priceless boon good health, having first witnessed his daughter's marriage with a gentleman by the name of Welby, who appeared every way qualified to render her future life happy. Ellen Trenton had also been about two years married to Mr. Beesley. This union was rather unwillingly entered into by the young lady, who was only induced to take the step, in order to save herself from the embarrassments consequent upon poverty, which her father assured her she could only avoid by means of marriage, as he should soon be obliged to greatly reduce his establishment. Mr. Beesley was reputed<pb n=""/> the richest young gentleman, and Miss Trenton the most fashionable and aristocratic young lady, in town; <emph>therefore</emph> they married, and the union was as happy a one as could be expected under such circumstances.</p> 
               <p>Mr. and Mrs. Trenton, after giving their daughter a splendid wedding, commenced their retrenchments, and were now actually endeavoring to live within their means.</p> 
               <p>Flotilla Crawford has for six years been the wife of the elderly beau we left wooing her seven years ago. If her husband, like most old bachelors, fancied the younger the lady he obtained for his wife, the less will she would have of her own, he has certainly had occasion, either to acknowledge himself mistaken, or to rejoice without ceasing, that the lady of his choice had not been one day older, when he led her to the altar; for, instead of moulding her to his every wish, as he had probably with all confidence anticipated, she managed <emph>him</emph> completely. Flotilla dressed very richly, went to parties and balls without her husband, who had no relish for such pastimes, flirted with the young gentlemen whenever she had an opportunity, and scattered her husband's money like ashes. He, poor soul, would usually knit his brow and bite his nails in <emph>silent</emph> agony; for, if he presumed to lift up his voice by way of remonstrance, as on a very <emph>few</emph> occasions he had the hardihood to attempt, he found to his great discomfort, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>"That storms may rage as fierce within,</l> 
                        <l>As ever storm without."</l> 
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>Indeed, the sweet Flotilla could disfigure her face with<pb n="392-393" xml:id="VAC5768-00000193"/> scowls, quite as easily as her husband; and soon convinced him of her entire ability to raise a domestic tempest on the slightest provocation, and on the shortest possible notice.</p> 
               <p>If the young wife chose, however, she could be very amiable; and it sometimes suited her purpose better to do so: if she wished an elegant article of dress for instance, that she suspected her husband would think too expensive, she would playfully and caressingly teaze him for it; and if objected to, would stop his mouth in a manner not altogether unpleasing to the gentleman, who, in consequence, usually became as wax in her hands.</p> 
               <p>Mr. and Mrs. Sanford, after an absence of five years, had again returned to Elville, (the former having obtained a situation in connection with the railroad,) and they are now occupying a small cottage situated in a retired part of the village, and see but little of their former associates. Mr. Sanford has altered but slightly in his personal appearance, but the pale beautiful woman, who sustains the relation of mother to his three children, could hardly be recognized as the once sprightly and blooming Bella Crawford. It is said, that since Sanford's return to Elville, he has not only treated his wife with extreme harshness, but has invited to his house and table, men whose faces were never seen, and whose names were never breathed in circles of refinement; men, or rather wretches, who did not hesitate to repeat vulgar sayings, and exchange rude jests in the presence of the sorrowful wife, who was frequently called upon to assist in their entertainment. Poor Bella! the cup which has been her's to drink, has been bitter indeed, and full to overflowing! but the last, most<pb n=""/> bitter portion still remains: would it could be spared thee Bella!</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Sanford is no longer the vain, novel-sick Bella, of former days, for sad reality has banished all fancies of a romantic nature from her mind; and trouble, while it has saddened her countenance, and nearly broken her heart, has also transformed her into an earnest, sensible, and thinking woman.</p> 
               <p>Kate Belton (strange as it may seem, when we remember her absolute horror of single life) is still unmarried. Her present admirer is Mr. Lawrence, the same who bestowed upon her some attentions while Mr. Beesley was the object of her pursuance. These attentions were continued for some time after Mr. Beesley had discontinued his visits to Miss Belton, and had commenced paying his addresses to Miss Trenton. Mr. Lawrence had always thought Kate pretty, and her apparent meekness of disposition, and pliancy of character, had greatly pleased him. He was flattered that the fashionable Mr. Beesley should manifest so much jealousy on his account, as to occasion that gentleman's dismissal, (of which circumstance he had been informed by Mrs. Belton, under promise of secresy,) and it is quite probable the young lady would have received an early offer of marriage from him, had not a new and pretty face made its appearance in Elville, just in time to prevent it. The new face soon completely captivated Mr. Lawrence, and quitting Kate, he devoted much of his spare time, and <emph>all</emph> of his compliments, to its possessor. After a few months' assiduous attentions the devoted admirer offered the lady the honor of his hand, and<pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC5768-00000194"/> (as the fair one was deplorably ignorant of what pertained to her happiness) was refused. Nothing daunted, Mr. Lawrence not very long after this rejection, astonished Nettie Carrol by making her a similar proposal, without having prefaced it by any of the usual attentions; but Nettie, though a sensible girl in the main, was a little short-sighted, consequently poor Mr. Lawrence received another decided negative. Latterly he had resumed his attentions to Kate, and as it was well understood that both parties were unusually desirous of changing their condition by means of marriage, it was now both hoped and believed, they would eventually take pity on each other, and unite their destinies.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Belton has altered very much in her appearance, during the last seven years: her once beautiful hair is now almost entirely gray, and her face is furrowed deeply, where before only slight wrinkles had been perceptible. This change the village gossips ill-naturedly ascribed to distress of mind, induced by Kate's continued celibacy, far more than to her advancing years. Mrs. Belton's manner towards her niece has also changed entirely, for no one now appears to be of greater importance in her eyes than her "dear Blanche," whom she consults on every possible occasion, and seems to regard as an oracle of wisdom. Blanche had written and published a volume of poems, which had now been nearly six years before the public, and which had been remarkably successful. She also contributed regularly to several popular magazines, and it was to these facts that many attributed the alteration in Mrs. Belton's conduct: the reader can probably discern still another cause.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>Nettie Carrol and Blanche Rathbone are still unmarried, and that they are so, is a matter of great wonderment to many, for even their enemies acknowledge that their single life cannot be the result of necessity. It had been, for some time past, decided by the good people of Elville, that Nettie and Dr. Milford would never "make a match," or it would have taken place "long ago:" the Doctor, they had heard, did not mean to marry; and some thought both Nettie and Blanche had made the same decision. Miss Rathbone, it was supposed, declined matrimony for the sake of having more time to devote to literary pursuits, than she could otherwise expect to command; and, therefore, was not considered wholly without excuse; although those who knew her well admitted that she possessed a thorough knowledge of household matters, and would make an excellent wife. For Nettie to decide upon a single life, was considered a different thing; she was regarded as so uncommonly well qualified for the management of a domestic establishment, and was looked upon as the possessor of so many virtues requisite to a pattern wife, that many pronounced it her imperative duty to enter upon the duties pertaining to that relation.</p> 
               <p>Neither Blanche or Nettie had changed much in their personal appearance, but were actually looking younger and better than many who were by several years their juniors. Although they were now spoken of as "old maids," or as nearly such, by some of the young girls who had just entered society, and by a <emph>few</emph> married ladies, who rejoiced in being able to state that <emph>they</emph> were so many years <emph>younger</emph>
                  <pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC5768-00000195"/> than Miss Carrol, or Miss Rathbone; and although a few of the <emph>older</emph> beaux of Elville, whose years would far outnumber their own, <emph>now</emph> shunned their society, as if fearful of being classed with them, they neither cared for the appellations of the former or the neglect of the latter. Not so with poor Kate Belton: she could not conceal her mortification, if any one so much as hinted that she either was, or was becoming an old maid; she associated as much as possible with the youngest ladies in society to the exclusion of those near her own age, and often spoke of herself as <emph>much</emph> younger than Miss Carrol, or her cousin Blanche; although she was well aware that Nettie, who was the eldest of the three, was but six months her senior. Kate would also frequently assert that no one could <emph>properly</emph> be called either an old maid or an old bachelor, before reaching middle life; and in <emph>this</emph> we certainly think her correct.</p> 
               <p>Nettie is now even more useful at home than ever, for her mother has for several months been confined to the house, and much of the time to her room, by ill-health; consequently, the entire charge of household affairs devolves upon her, for her sister Fanny married very soon after entering society; and a sister still younger, is not yet emancipated from the school-room.</p> 
               <p>Charlie Lee, after finishing his collegiate course, had returned to Elville; soon after which, his father unexpectedly presented him with several thousand dollars, as capital with which to commence business for himself. He is now an uncommonly fine-looking man, is graceful but dignified in his<pb n=""/> manners, agreeable and polite in conversation, and far above all, the possessor of an <emph>unblemished character.</emph> A young man like Mr. Lee, could hardly fail of being much courted in society, and certainly Charlie could not complain of neglect. Many were the efforts put forth by some of the youngest ladies in society, to secure his attentions to themselves; but though affable and polite to all, young Lee was really attentive to none but his old friends Nettie and Blanche. As his courtesies were apparently equally divided between these two ladies, and as it was well known that they had grown up, as it were, together, it was thought quite natural he should continue to take pleasure in their society, especially as they had been his departed sister's most intimate friends; and but little else was said of it. A few <emph>old</emph> ladies, however, of <emph>late,</emph> had ventured to predict that Mr. Lee would marry either Miss Carrol or Miss Rathbone, if he could but induce the chosen one to change her situation; but others were of the opinion that the young gentleman was already engaged to some fine lady he had met with abroad, and that his indifference to the younger belles of Elville was owing to this engagement. They had no idea that such a thing as marriage between Mr. Lee and either of the ladies mentioned, was in contemplation-the ladies would not marry,-and Mr. Lee, if still disengaged, would prefer some one whom he had not known for so long a period, as ladies and gentlemen who have been acquainted from childhood, seldom choose each other for partners through life. So said the majority: were they wholly correct? we shall see.</p>

               <p>"O NETTIE, I have some news for you!" exclaimed Blanche Rathbone with animation, as she joined her friend, who was out on a walk one delightful morning. "I have been trying to overtake you this long time, so as to walk in your company and tell you it, but I'll warrant you have heard it before this time," she added, smilingly; "Charlie or Dr. Milford has informed you, or you have seen it yourself in the papers."</p> 
               <p>"If you refer to the recent important changes in the laws of our State," returned Nettie, "I certainly have heard of them; Dr. Milford was my informant: he called last evening and said he had some news that he was confident it would give me pleasure to hear; then pulling a paper from his pocket he read me the new law which empowers a married lady to hold property in her own name; he and I both think that it can but result in good to both husband and wife. The improvements<pb n=""/> provements are much greater than I had dared to hope would be effected during my lifetime," continued Nettie; "and I cannot see that anything better could be done for us, or be expected, at least, so far as the holding of property is concerned. <emph>I</emph> am delighted with the change! it was to this you alluded to, was it not?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes," returned Blanche; "and with you I can truly say, I am rejoiced that so much has been accomplished: men really appear to have awakened to a sense of their former injustice, and now seem not only willing, but even anxious, that we should be placed on terms of greater equality with themselves; as far as they can see the light, I think they are ready to follow it-not <emph>all</emph> indeed, and perhaps not the majority, but still very many; and I am thankful to Heaven for having led them to think of our wrongs, and for giving them a disposition to lessen them in any degree; still I fear, Nettie, I cannot quite agree with you in thinking <emph>all</emph> accomplished that is desirable, even as regards property; for this new law has a serious defect, if I have been rightly informed."</p> 
               <p>"Defect! what can it be?" exclaimed Nettie.</p> 
               <p>"I was told this morning," returned Miss Rathbone, "that though a wife has power <emph>now,</emph> to hold her property, and use it as she pleases; she has no power given her to make a will during her husband's lifetime; so, I suppose, if he out-lives his wife, he can, as 'tenant by courtesy,' take possession of her property and appropriate its avails to his sole use, in preference to any other heir or heirs that may<pb n="400-401" xml:id="VAC5768-00000197"/> exist. Now if this is true, it might furnish an unprincipled husband with a motive for ridding himself of a wife, that was the holder of much property, besides being objectionable on other accounts."</p> 
               <p>"But I think it cannot be true," said Nettie; "for <emph>I</emph> understand the statute to state distinctly, that the wife should have power to <emph>dispose</emph> of such property the same as if a single woman; now a single woman <emph>certainly</emph> has power to make a will. Your informant must have been mistaken I think."</p> 
               <p>"I understood it at first, exactly as you do now," returned Blanche; "but on a second examination, I found it to read 'of the <emph>avails</emph> of such property.' Last evening Esquire Billings gave us a call, and I asked his opinion of the matter; he said the recent statute <emph>did not</emph> give the wife <emph>any</emph> right whatever to dispose of any part of her possession by will, during her husband's life. Now as Esquire Billings is <emph>one</emph> of our first lawyers, I concluded that the information I had received was correct; still I should be most happy to have it proven otherwise; but be that as it may, I do not feel disposed to complain, because all that could be desired has not been accomplished at once."</p> 
               <p>"No, certainly not," returned Nettie; "for if it is as you think, I presume it will not be long before the evil will be remedied. But Blanche," she continued, "I have some news for you this morning, and a favor to ask besides-can you guess what it is?"</p> 
               <p>"I think I can," answered Blanche, archly, after scanning her friend's face for an instant. "You have been saying <emph>yes</emph>
                  <pb n=""/> to our friend Charlie, and now you are going to have the audacity to ask <emph>me</emph> to countenance you in it; I declare I did not think this new law would have such a <emph>powerful</emph> effect on you so <emph>soon.</emph> Have I not guessed right, Miss Nettie?"</p> 
               <p>"I cannot deny it Blanche; Charlie has at last worried that little monosyllable from my lips, and I have presumed not only to think of asking your approval, but also your attendance at the wedding as bride's-maid; but you are mistaken if you really fancy these recent improvements have influenced me, for I had given my word to Charlie before the news had reached my ear."</p> 
               <p>"And <emph>yet,</emph> it appears to me I once heard Nettie Carrol say, that unless there <emph>should be</emph> a favorable alteration in the laws, she did not think she <emph>could be induced</emph> to marry," said Blanche, with mock seriousness. "But I <emph>may</emph> have been mistaken," she added, "indeed I <emph>must</emph> have been."</p> 
               <p>"What a provoking creature you can be, Blanche, when you choose," returned Nettie, pleasantly. "I know I once said, that I did not think I should ever be persuaded to marry," she proceeded, "and you know I have always acted accordingly, until <emph>now;</emph> but with Charlie I have always been acquainted, as you know,-and then his views upon every important subject are in perfect harmony with mine; indeed, Blanche, I cannot think I run much of a risk in marrying <emph>him.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"I presume almost any lady has equal confidence in the man she is willing to marry," answered Blanche; "but I will admit," she continued, more seriously, "that but very few<pb n="402-403" xml:id="VAC5768-00000198"/> have had an equal opportunity of learning the true character and disposition of their partner before marriage; and to be honest, I really think you do not risk a great deal by uniting yourself to Charlie Lee. Had not your presence been so very necessary at home, I should have wondered at your hesitating so long before deciding in his favor: how your mother is to spare you <emph>now,</emph> is more than <emph>I</emph> can understand."</p> 
               <p>"O she is not to spare me long at present," said Nettie, "for it is arranged that we are to remain at father's for five or six months, after our marriage, during which time, I am to initiate Helen (who will soon be out of school) into as many of the mysteries of housekeeping as possible, so that she may be able to supply my place in some measure, when I leave for another home. And then you know we are going to live in Elville, so it is not as if we were going to leave the town; and mother's health has improved so much during the last month, that we feel encouraged to hope she may soon be entirely restored. But you have not promised to act as bride's-maid, Blanche; we can depend on you, can we not?"</p> 
               <p>"O yes, certainly; but when is the wedding to be?"</p> 
               <p>"About the middle of next month, unless mother should get much worse than at present," answered Nettie.</p> 
               <p>"But who have you decided upon for groom's-man on that occasion?"</p> 
               <p>"Any one that <emph>you</emph> say, Blanche, we will invite. Charlie and I have thought of Dr. Milford, and we think, as our invitations are to be confined to a very few, he will not object to acting in that capacity; but if you would prefer any one else,<pb n=""/> (<emph>Esquire Billings,</emph> for instance,) Mr. Lee will not speak to the Doctor on the subject."</p> 
               <p>"I prefer Dr. Milford," said Blanche, decidedly; "so you are to be married in about five weeks," she continued, "that will bring two weddings rather near together."</p> 
               <p>"How so?"</p> 
               <p>"O! I believe I have not told you, that our Kate is engaged at last."</p> 
               <p>"No, indeed, you have not!" exclaimed Miss Carrol, quickly, "is it so, Blanche?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I believe she is <emph>positively</emph> engaged <emph>now,</emph>" returned Miss Rathbone, "she informed me of it about two days ago; and yesterday Mr. Lawrence had a long conference with aunt, which I presume was very satisfactory, for she has been remarkably agreeable ever since. Kate is to be married within three weeks from now, for she has but little to do by way of preparation, having attended to such matters long ago."</p> 
               <p>"How are you pleased with this arrangement, Blanche?"</p> 
               <p>"O I don't know, I never liked Mr. Lawrence in the least, and yet, I can't help being glad that Kate is to be married, notwithstanding he is to be her husband."</p> 
               <p>"Do you suppose Mr. Langly will be present at the wedding?" asked Nettie.</p> 
               <p>"I rather think not," Blanche replied, "for he has had aunt visit <emph>him,</emph> you know, instead of coming here himself, since she informed him of my discoveries concerning my property. He has often written that he was coming, but has never made his appearance, at least when I have been in<pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC5768-00000199"/> town. I think he does not care to see me, <emph>very</emph> particularly, although he never fails of sending me his kind regards whenever he writes to aunt."</p> 
               <p>"I'm not surprised that he should not care to see you," said Nettie; "I think I should not desire it much if I was in his situation. When Charlie and I get to housekeeping," she continued, "we shall insist upon your making your home with us until you marry yourself. Your aunt may wish to break up housekeeping after Kate's marriage, and we should be only too happy to have you with us."</p> 
               <p>"O, aunt has no thought of breaking up at present," returned Blanche, "for Kate declares she cannot think of taking upon herself the cares of a housekeeper while it is possible to avoid it; and it is decided that the happy couple are to board with aunt; but as it will not be very pleasant for me to remain there long, after Kate's marriage, I think I shall change my boarding-place, and perhaps, will accept of your proposition, for a time at least, that is, if I <emph>then</emph> think it would be agreeable and convenient to yourself and husband. As for marriage, you know I do not think of it, and probably never shall."</p> 
               <p>"There will <emph>always</emph> be room for <emph>you</emph> in our house, Blanche, whenever, and so long as we shall have a house for ourselves," returned Nettie, warmly; "and I wonder at your daring to hint at the <emph>possibility</emph> of your ever being other than welcome to either Charlie or myself," she added less seriously. "You say you do not intend to marry," continued Nettie, "now<pb n=""/> Blanche, is that decision to be immovable, now that the laws are so much improved?"</p> 
               <p>"I do not think I shall be easily tempted to alter it," said Miss Rathbone; "but, were I sought and beloved by a person, in every way as estimable as we think Mr. Lee, and did I entertain for him the same affection that you do for him, I think it quite possible, that like you, I might forget former resolutions, and promise him my hand; for like you, I am naturally warm-hearted and confiding. But Nettie," continued Blanche, "I am persuaded that Providence has designed me for a single life, and as I believe I can be happy, useful, and independent in it, I can see no good reason for wishing to change it for the married state, where happiness is at best very uncertain, and where independence is almost if not entirely out of the question. I certainly would not dare trust myself to a stranger; for notwithstanding my confiding nature, my cautiousness is pretty well developed; and among my present gentlemen acquaintances, whom I have known for any great length of time, I cannot now think of one whom I have reason to believe would make me such a husband as I could desire, and who would love me as I should wish to be loved, or whom I could love as I feel I am capable of loving. So you see it is just as well that I have made up my mind to live and be happy in single blessedness."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I shall not quarrel with you, let you do which you will," said Nettie, "for I know you are capable of making yourself useful in either situation. You are possessed of so affectionate a disposition," she continued, "and are naturally<pb n="406-407" xml:id="VAC5768-00000200"/> so companionable, that I thought if you could marry a person worthy of you, you would be happier than to remain as you are, through life, with no <emph>particular</emph> object on which to bestow the wealth of such a heart, and from whom you might confidently look for a grateful return. Besides, you have no nearer relatives than your aunt and cousin, and between them and you there can be no real sympathy. These are my only reasons for wishing you to marry."</p> 
               <p>Miss Rathbone's face saddened while Nettie was speaking.</p> 
               <p>"Ah! Nettie, I have often thought of this," she said. "I know that, constituted as <emph>I</emph> am, I never can be <emph>very</emph> happy without sympathy; and I confess it sometimes makes me sorrowful to think of growing old, and at last dropping into the grave with none to grieve, if sorrow should fall upon my gray hairs, or mourn when my eyes were closed for ever. To your affection, dear Nettie, and to the maternal regard and attention of your honored mother, I owe nearly all of the sunlight that has thus far been shed upon the pathway of my existence; without it, with my naturally impulsive disposition, and left to the sole guidance of an aunt who could never understand me, and to the indulgence of an untutored and ardent fancy, I tremble to think of what I might have become. From you and your mother I have always received sympathy, both in joy and sorrow, and encouragment when my heart was almost breaking; but Nettie, though I am certain I may always depend upon your friendship, I <emph>feel</emph> that you cannot hereafter feel <emph>for</emph> me and <emph>with</emph> me, to the same extent as formerly; for the new ties you are about forming<pb n=""/> will of course absorb the greater part of your thoughts and affections. I do not complain of this, but still I <emph>know</emph> that I shall feel very lonely when you are Nettie Carrol no longer."</p> 
               <p>"O, I shall not change, dear Blanche! I shall be Nettie Carrol to <emph>you</emph> as long as I live, do not think otherwise."</p> 
               <p>Blanche smiled doubtingly. "I will hope so," she said, "for if you <emph>do</emph> change <emph>very</emph> materially I shall feel that I have sustained an almost irreparable loss."</p> 
               <p>"I shall not change, Blanche; <emph>sisters</emph> do not lose their affection for each other in consequence of marriage, and I am sure you have always been as a sister to me. But I can't help wishing you were not so opposed to marriage," she continued, "for it is so pleasant to love a person that you know is every way worthy of your regard, and feel that you are as dear to them as life itself. If you ever do meet with a person as suitable for you as you say Charlie is for me, and he loved you, would you still refuse to marry?"</p> 
               <p>"I <emph>might</emph> not: but I never shall meet with such a person. I believe, as I said before, that it is purposed otherwise, and I am not going to war with Providence to change my condition."</p> 
               <p>"But Blanche, why do you fancy <emph>Providence</emph> has assigned <emph>you</emph> a single life?" said Nettie; "they are <emph>very</emph> few who have had more frequent opportunities of changing their situation in this respect, than yourself; you have also thought seriously of matrimony, and on one occasion, you know, you was almost on the eve of marriage."</p> 
               <pb n="408-409" xml:id="VAC5768-00000201"/> 
               <p>"I know it, Nettie, and that is one reason why I have come to the conclusion that I have mentioned; twice, when I was very young, and before I had learned to look upon marriage in the serious light I now do, I met with persons whom I fancied I could love, because, to my then unpractised eyes, they appeared possessed of almost every noble and amiable quality, as well as of pleasing exteriors; and I had nearly concluded that I could return their proffered affection, and would accept of their proposals; when the veil that concealed their true character, and the fearful precipice upon which I stood, was suddenly, but mercifully removed from my eyes, just in time to prevent my leaping blindly into the angry waves at my very feet. Again, after I had attained to riper years, I met with one who pleased me much, and whom we both thought every way estimable; as you know, I rather hastily promised him my hand; but before we had been long engaged, I discovered failings in him that I felt would interfere greatly with my future happiness as his wife, and yet not sufficiently grave in their nature to destroy my affection for him, or justify his dismission. I tried, therefore, to blind myself to his faults, and resolved to adhere to my engagement; but the day that was to have witnessed our union shed its light upon his grave. In all this, Nettie, I can plainly discern the hand of an overruling Providence; and if I have ever felt inclined to murmur at its dealings, I do not feel so now, for I believe that all has been for the best."</p> 
               <p>"I have no doubt of it, Blanche; it certainly is better not to be united to a man who is unworthy of you, <emph>that</emph> is easily<pb n=""/> seen. But because you have had narrow escapes from such, is no good reason for supposing you will <emph>never</emph> meet with a suitable person. But if you do not marry, how will you employ your time and affections for the future?"</p> 
               <p>"How?-I will strive to love all God's creatures that are not surrounded by friends and prosperity, and endeavor to scatter blessings in their path;-I will befriend the widow and the orphan, who like myself may be alone in the world;-I will teach little children to love me, and will exert myself for their true benefit; and will cultivate to its utmost extent the talent that God has given me, and seek to make it the means of doing much good. In all of this, I will strive to act from right motives, and for this end, will in all things seek the direction and blessing of Heaven. O, I shall be happy, Nettie, even though I have no kindred to care for me-happy enough, for earth; were I more so, I might not be as willing to depart should the angel of Death summon me early from the shores of Time. It is better as it is-I do not, will not wish it otherwise."</p> 
               <p>As Blanche finished speaking, a bright smile parted her lips, though a dewy moisture was in her eye. Nettie thought she had never seen her when more beautiful.</p> 
               <p>"The young ladies, who had been walking on a retired street during the greater part of the foregoing conversation, now approached Mrs. Belton's residence; and as Blanche had promised to render her cousin some assistance that day, she declined Nettie's invitation, then given, to call with her upon their old friend Susan, now Mrs. Welby.</p>

               <p>WHEN Nettie Carrol arrived at Mrs. Welby's residence, she proceeded directly to her sitting-room, which after a gentle knock, she entered, as was her custom, without waiting for her signal to be answered. Here she found everything in unusual disorder, (although the morning was now far advanced,) and the room without an occupant. Susan, she was certain would not go out leaving her house in such confusion, unless in case of great emergency; and if at home, Nettie thought it equally singular, so late an hour should find her usual morning duties unperformed. "She must be ill," was her mental exclamation; and having arrived at this conclusion, she peeped into her friend's sleeping apartment, the door of which was partly opened; but a single glance within sufficed to convince her that that room was unoccupied. The covering had been removed from the bed, and a broom was resting against the dressing table, but this was all that indicated that so much as an attempt had been made towards putting the room in order.</p> 
               <p>"What can be the matter!" soliloquized Nettie.</p> 
               <p>"Susan usually attends to these things herself; it <emph>must</emph>
                  <pb n=""/> be her servant has fallen sick, or for some reason has left her, and in consequence, she has been obliged to defer these duties in order to attend to more pressing ones in the kitchen; yes, it must be so, for the cradle is gone too, and <emph>now</emph> I hear the baby's voice. Poor Susan! she will make but sorry work there!"</p> 
               <p>In another moment Nettie had crossed the passageway leading from the sitting-room to the kitchen, on tip-toe, and was standing a silent, unobserved, but amused spectator of the scene now presented to her view. In one corner of the room stood a wicker cradle, in which a beautiful blue-eyed child was sitting, well supported by pillows, and secured from any danger of falling by means of numerous fastenings. The child's long dress, and the floor around, was scattered over with expensive trinkets, but the babe had pushed most of them from his reach, and was now making vigorous onsets with his gums on an India-rubber ring, that was attached, by means of a riband, to his neck. Beside the kitchen-table stood Mrs. Welby, her rich dress and silk apron well sprinkeled with flour, and her hands completely covered with dough, from which she was vainly endeavoring to free them. On the table were several well-buttered plates, but what the mixture was intended for, over which Susan was holding her hands, Nettie could not divine. Her first impulse was to hasten to her friend's assistance; but on second thoughts, she concluded to let her proceed for a moment or two longer without interruption.</p> 
               <p>If the truth must be told, Nettie, ill-natured as it may<pb n="412-413" xml:id="VAC5768-00000203"/> make her appear, actually enjoyed her friend's perplexity, and smiled to see her with one doughy hand endeavoring to free its fellow from its clinging burthen. At length Susan impatiently plunged her hands into a basin of cold water, which was standing near, and began to rub them zealously. Knowing that her friend had not adopted a very expeditious method of freeing herself from her present difficulty, Nettie resolved to emerge from her concealment and offer her assistance immediately; but before she had done so, Susan's remaining stock of patience was exhausted.</p> 
               <p>"I never shall be able to get this off in the world!" she exclaimed aloud, drawing her hands from the water, and flinging herself upon a chair. "O dear what <emph>shall</emph> I do! I wish I had never thought of ma--; housekeeping, it's such a <emph>dreadful</emph> trouble! What an unreasonable man George is, to think of inviting company to dinner! I wish I had told him I couldn't have it, for I <emph>never can</emph> get this dinner, I am <emph>sure</emph> I never can!" and the young housekeeper's tears fell rapidly. Of course Mrs. Welby could not cover her eyes with her hands, so she bowed her head upon the edge of the table and sobbed aloud. In a moment the babe began to worry, and the young mother raising her head, beheld Nettie standing directly before her.</p> 
               <p>"Why, Nettie Carrol!" she exclaimed, with a look of surprise, but smiling through her tears, "<emph>when</emph> did you come? I am delighted to see you, for I need your advice, and I am afraid your assistance, sadly, just now."</p> 
               <p>"Anything that I can do for you, will be most cheerfully<pb n=""/> performed," returned Nettie. "I see you appear to be in trouble, and without help; what is the matter? But before explaining to me, just rub your hands with a little dry flour," she continued, "it will soon remove the dough, and while you are doing it, I will try to quiet that noisy little urchin in the cradle."</p> 
               <p>"Now, what is to be made of this mixture?" she asked, after Mrs. Welby had followed her directions, and she had placed the quieted and now drowsy babe in her arms. "I am anxious to know, for I never saw you looking more perplexed in my life."</p> 
               <p>"I never <emph>was</emph> more so, Nettie,-but my heart is as light as a feather, now that you are here, and have promised to help me, for you know just how to manage everything. You must never marry; Nettie, for we can't spare you; I am sure if I had known only <emph>half</emph> as much as you do, I should have thought myself quite too good for any common man."</p> 
               <p>"But Susan, I thought you were going to tell me how you came to be without help, and in this situation, and what you were making," said Nettie. "From some portions of your soliloquy. I judge that you are expecting company to dinner, if so, the sooner we get at it the better, I suppose."</p> 
               <p>"O I don't feel hurried at all, now that you are here to help me manage," said Mrs. Welby, "for we are going to have a late dinner. We are to have company sure enough," she continued, "and I will tell you all about how it happened, and why you find me in this predicament. About three weeks ago, the woman that has always kept house for me ever<pb n="414-415" xml:id="VAC5768-00000204"/> since I was married, and has taken charge of everything almost, took it into her head to marry, herself-so she left me, and since then, I have been obliged to put up with a raw Dutch girl, who understood nothing but the plainest kind of cooking. This girl agreed to stay a month with me at least, and then, if both liked, we were to bargain for a year. Well, last evening, Mr. Welby came home to tea a little earlier than usual, and requested me to dress myself as richly as possible, and accompany him as soon as supper was over to the Elville house, for the purpose of calling upon a lady and gentleman from New York, who were stopping there. Mr. Welby said this couple were old and intimate friends of his, and were anxious to make my acquaintance, having heard a great deal about me through him and others. Seeing that my husband was more than usually solicitous about my appearance, I dressed myself with as much taste as possible, and endeavored to look my best. Immediately after supper we set out on our walk, he complimenting me, as I thought, rather extravagantly on my good looks, until we had nearly reached the Elville house; then, suddenly looking me in the face, he said,-</p> 
               <p>"'Susan, dear, don't you think politeness will require us to invite Mr. and Mrs. Vandorn to stop with us the few days they remain in town, seeing they are such particular friends of mine?'</p> 
               <p>"I was so thunder-struck, (if I may use the expression,) as to be unable to reply at once. I could not bear to deny my husband, who is always ready to oblige me, what to him might appear a simple favor, easily granted; and yet, with the<pb n=""/> help I had, I felt that the thing was quite impossible. 'I think, George,' I said at last, 'if these persons were <emph>also</emph> particular friends of mine, instead of being utter strangers, there would be no question in the matter; but as it is, I really do not think the obligation at all imperative: if I had not lost my old housekeeper, if her place was better supplied, or, if I was less ignorant myself, I would gladly consent to such an arrangement; but situated as we <emph>now</emph> are, I really do not think we could make their stay here either pleasant for them, or convenient for us.'</p> 
               <p>"'Very well, my dear,' said Mr. Welby, good humoredly, 'we won't invite them to <emph>stop</emph> with us; I presume you understand these matters much better than I do; they will expect some attention though, so we will invite them to dine with us some day before they leave. I know you will like them, for they are a very pleasant and genteel couple.'</p> 
               <p>"We had now reached the hotel, and I had not the heart to tell Mr. Welby that to get up a dinner for invited guests, would be almost as much of an undertaking for <emph>me</emph> as the one he had so cheerfully resigned for my sake. I felt that he was not to blame for my ignorance, and realized as I never had before the true value of domestic knowledge; I felt that no accomplishment could compensate a husband for the absence of it in his wife, and for the first time in my life I saw how much his comfort and happiness depended on such matters. Feeling all this, I had not the courage to tell my husband that a few friends could not be entertained respectably at his house, because his wife had been suffered to neglect<pb n="416-417" xml:id="VAC5768-00000205"/> one of the most important branches of a lady's education, and was therefore unqualified for the situation she had undertaken to occupy. Hoping these strangers would decline our invitation, or if they accepted, would not do so under a day or two, by which time I might furnish myself with extra help, I nodded assent to my husband's inquiring look, and then we were ushered into the presence of Mr. and Mrs. Vandorn. When we were about leaving, my husband assured them that he and I would have been delighted to have had the pleasure of their company at our house during their stay in town, had we been so situated as to be able to make such a visit at all pleasant for them; but, that unfortunately, we had recently been obliged to part with the services of a valuable domestic whose place had not yet been made good, and our babe, not being well, was so worrisome as to require more than ordinary attention; that for these reasons we could not hope to make our house as agreeable to them as we could wish; but that we could not consent to be deprived of a visit from them altogether. My husband then looked at me. I knew what he wished, so I quickly and as politely as possible, requested them to say on what day we might hope for the pleasure of their company to dinner. Nettie, I hope your heart may never feel as heavy as mine did, when they accepted of our invitation, and named to-day as the only convenient time for them to visit us-they think of leaving town to-morrow. I tried to look as happy as politeness required, and when they asked at what hour we should dine, I left it entirely to them, hoping all the time they would make it as late as possible.<pb n=""/> Mrs. Vandorn, whom I do not much like, said that when in the city, they usually dined at five, but if an earlier hour would suit us better, it would make little or no difference with them. I of course insisted on five, and so at five we are to dine, that is, if we are to have any dinner at all. Mr. Welby," continued Susan, "was wonderfully pleased with his call, and appeared to anticipate much pleasure from the expected visit, but I could not long conceal my feelings from him, and finally told him, that with my present help or any that I could hope to obtain, I had no idea I should be able to get up a dinner that his friend would consider passable.</p> 
               <p>"'O fie, Susan,' said he, 'just give them a warm welcome, and they'll be satisfied, I'll warrant you. We have had friends to dine with us before, and I am sure they have been pretty well served.'</p> 
               <p>"'We had Morley then, you know,' said I, 'and she did every bit of the cooking herself, but Ruth don't understand any but the very plainest kind, and I can't learn her, for I don't know anything myself.'</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Welby then muttered something that sounded like 'the more's the pity,' and I could see by his looks that he was not before aware of the extent of my ignorance, and was becoming himself a little anxious about the dinner.</p> 
               <p>"'Well, the deed is done!' he exclaimed with a sigh, 'they are invited now, and must come I suppose. Get whatever assistance you want, and all will go off well enough, I guess, if you don't <emph>borrow</emph> any trouble.'</p> 
               <p>"I then proposed hiring a professed cook for the day,<pb n="418-419" xml:id="VAC5768-00000206"/> and Mr. Welby engaged one immediately who promised to be here at nine o'clock this morning. But while we were at breakfast, her little girl came in and told us her mother had burned her hand so badly as to be unable to come. As soon as breakfast was over, Mr. Welby went in search of another cook, but did not succeed in finding any one who was disengaged, but he found a woman who said she could 'cook a <emph>leetle,</emph>' and she promised to be here at twelve o'clock precisely, as a general assistant. After Mr. Welby had gone out, I told Ruth to watch the baby, while I ran into a neighbor's to obtain a few directions about the cooking of my meats. On my return, I found her with her things on as if going out. I asked her what it meant, and was saucily informed that she was going to another place where she could get a shilling more a week, and where 'the mistress' knew enough to do her own 'bossing.' She had cooked for city folks before, she said, and if she wasn't good enough to cook for our <emph>visitors,</emph> she wouldn't cook for <emph>us,</emph> and off she went, before I could utter another word.</p> 
               <p>"So you see, Nettie, in just what a condition I am in."</p> 
               <p>"Bad enough, certainly," said Miss Carrol. "But why didn't you send for me, when you found yourself in such trouble?"</p> 
               <p>"Because I thought I had troubled you enough, heretofore, and to tell the truth, I did not exactly like the idea of your finding me so circumstanced, for I remembered the lecture you once gave me, and how you warned me of the probability of my finding myself some time in a situation almost<pb n=""/> exactly like the present. If I had only followed your advice <emph>then,</emph> I might have saved myself much trouble and perplexity. But Nettie, if you will only undertake to give me a few lessons now, I will be the most humble pupil in the world, and will do anything in my power to serve you."</p> 
               <p>"Well then, Mrs. Welby, if I am to be your teacher," said Nettie, gaily, "just place that child in the cradle again, it will sleep quite as well there as in your arms; besides, it is quite time we were at work. I will stay with you to-day, if you will get some child to take a note from me to mother, so that she may know where I am."</p> 
               <p>"Certainly," said Susan; "I can easily do that. Now Miss Directress," she said, after placing the babe in the cradle, "what shall I do first?"</p> 
               <p>"Just divest yourself of that silk apron, if you please, and substitute a cotton one in its place, and get another one for me."</p> 
               <p>"I can't do it, Nettie!'</p> 
               <p>"Why not?"</p> 
               <p>"Because I haven't got such a thing in the house."</p> 
               <p>"Well then, get a couple of large towels-it won't do to work in flour with silk aprons on. There, those will do very well. Now what is that in that moulding pan, that you were to work at when I came in? I asked you before, but you forgot to tell me."</p> 
               <p>"That?-its pastry."</p> 
               <p>"Pastry?" and in spite of every effort to control them, Nettie's lips would smile.</p> 
               <pb n="420-421" xml:id="VAC5768-00000207"/> 
               <p>"Yes, pastry-pie-crust, you know,-we must have pies! You provoking creature you! what are you laughing at?"</p> 
               <p>"I didn't mean to laugh, Susan, but it is such queer-looking pie-crust."</p> 
               <p>"O well, I hadn't finished it yet," said Susan; "when it is made up a little stiffer, it will look differently."</p> 
               <p>"But it looks as if it was wet up with buttermilk," persisted Nettie.</p> 
               <p>"Well so it is," answered Mrs. Welby. "Don't <emph>you</emph> make pie-crust like common shortened biscuit?"</p> 
               <p>"No indeed I do not-and never heard of any one who did."</p> 
               <p>"Well, now that's queer! What can I do with this dough?"</p> 
               <p>"The best thing you can do with it <emph>now</emph> is, to make it into biscuit for your family's use; but get me the materials first, and I will make your pies for you while you are doing it."</p> 
               <p>"But <emph>can I</emph> make the <emph>biscuit</emph> Nettie?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly;-if you obey directions, you need have no trouble. The way to learn, is to work yourself-you never acquire much knowledge, by merely looking on; therefore, in your lessons, after to-day, I shall do the looking on myself-give the directions, and let you do the work."</p> 
               <p>"Agreed!" exclaimed Susan; "only help me through <emph>this</emph> day, and I will never trouble you for anything more than directions hereafter."</p> 
               <p>A busy day it was for Nettie and Susan, but by the excellent management of the former, everything went on "like<pb n=""/> clock work." The woman Mr. Welby had engaged, made her appearance at the appointed time, and made herself exceedingly useful. The babe slept much of the time, and when awake, was so uncommonly good-humored, that its mother began to fear her visitors would think its case had been misrepresented.</p> 
               <p>At exactly five o'clock, Mr. and Mrs. Vandorn made their appearance, and were received by their host and hostess with much ease and politeness. Susan knew that her house was in perfect order, and was confident her dinner would be excellent, for Nettie had prepared or superintended it all, and had pronounced it good: therefore no harassing care prevented her making herself agreeable to her guests, and agreeable she was. Susan had been somewhat afraid she should not be able to make the visit pleasant to her husband's friends, therefore she had urged Nettie almost beyond the bounds of reason, to dine with them. (for Miss Carrol, dear reader, was quite as much at home in the drawing-room, as in the kitchen; was inferior to no young lady in Elville in the possession of the ordinary accomplishments, and was generally considered more than commonly agreeable in society.) Nettie, however, resolutely declined this invitation, and after seeing every thing upon the cable, or ready for it; and after leaving every necessary direction with the hired woman, and the little girl who had been engaged to assist her, she took her departure.</p> 
               <p>"How well everything passed off!" exclaimed the happy husband, proudly, to his wife, after their guests had gone.<pb n="422-423" xml:id="VAC5768-00000208"/> "What a beautiful dinner we had, and how well you looked and appeared,-I never was prouder of you in my life!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, everything did pass off well," returned Mrs. Welby; "but if Nettie Carrol had not helped me, I don't know what I should have done-I am certain I could not have got up even a respectable dinner without her."</p> 
               <p>"That Nettie Carrol is an excellent girl, and a pretty one too;" remarked Mr. Welby. "Why on earth don't she marry? she would make a capital wife!"</p> 
               <p>"Because there is no one good enough for her, and she can do more good as she is;" answered his wife promptly. "She is a perfect jewel of a girl," continued Susan; "she has promised to teach me all kinds of cookery, and I am determined to go about learning directly, and in good earnest. So my dear, don't be discouraged, for I will make you an excellent wife yet." Mrs. Welby was sincere, and we believe will keep her word.</p>

               <p>"O BLANCHE! have you heard about Ellen Beesley's trouble?" asked Kate, now Mrs. Lawrence, of her cousin, upon Blanche's return from Mr. Carrol's, where she had remained an hour or two for the purpose of rendering Mrs. Carrol a little assistance after the other guests had departed.</p> 
               <p>"Not a word <emph>lately,</emph>" Blanche answered; "what is it? anything more than another quarrel?"</p> 
               <pb n="424-425" xml:id="VAC5768-00000209"/> 
               <p>"Yes, rather worse this time; Ellen has left Beesley and gone home. Mrs. Trenton herself has just told me all about it; she says Ellen declares she won't live with him another day, and that she doesn't blame her one bit."</p> 
               <p>"What was the trouble <emph>this</emph> time?" asked Blanche.</p> 
               <p>"I will tell you," returned Mrs. Lawrence, "as soon as I can come to it. You see Mr. Beesley has got into the habit of finding fault with about everything that comes on to the table; the meat is always either too rare or too dry, the potatoes are too brown, (if fried,) or not brown enough, his coffee is never right, and Mrs. Trenton says there has not been a single loaf of bread baked in that house that he hasn't found fault with, though every pains has been taken to have it suit him; in fact, he is what mother calls a regular 'Betty.' Ellen, you know, is uncommon quick tempered, and such actions wouldn't please her at all, so of course they had terrible quarrels every little while, just about the cooking. Mrs. Trenton says that when Ellen got a little over her pets, she always tried to have things cooked to his taste, but never succeeded; for what he would say one day suited him, was sure not to on another."</p> 
               <p>"That was rather hard," remarked Blanche.</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Rather!</emph> I guess it was," continued Kate; "but what provoked Ellen the most was his going into the kitchen and countermanding her orders to her domestics, and undertaking to give directions about the cooking. His doing so played the mischief with her servants too, for they would not put up with it, and so Ellen has had to change her help eight<pb n=""/> or nine times at least, within the last year. Well, about four weeks ago, it seems Mrs. Beesley was left without help again, so she hired a <emph>colored</emph> girl, thinking she would not be as much inclined to resent her husband's interference as her other girls had been; but being a little prejudiced against color herself, and thinking Mr. Beesley wouldn't eat bread made by this girl, though she came recommended as an excellent cook, she resolved to do her baking herself; so she got her mother's cook to teach her, and after only one failure, she succeeded in making very good bread, which her husband ate and grumbled over as usual, without asking by whom it was made. Well, day before yesterday, this black girl took offence and left, because Ellen scolded her pretty sharply about something; so yesterday, Mrs. Beesley had no help but a little girl, that her mother sent her for the day, and of course had pretty much everything to do with her own hands. Among other things, it seems she baked some bread, which she thought unusually nice; but when they sat down to tea, Mr. Beesley was feeling very cross, because, when at dinner, he had said muffins would be good again, and yet there were no muffins for supper; so, before he had so much as tasted of the bread he began to complain.</p> 
               <p>"'Why didn't you burn your bread up, an' done with it?" said he.'</p> 
               <p>"'I thought you <emph>liked</emph> your bread baked very brown,' said Ellen; 'you did last week anyway, and so I tried to suit you.'</p> 
               <p>"'I didn't say I liked it as black as my hat, or the chimney-back<pb n="426-427" xml:id="VAC5768-00000210"/> ney-back, for I don't like <emph>coal,</emph>' said her husband. Then Ellen said, 'it's not burned in the least, it's only a darkish brown; but you like to find fault, sir,' said she, 'and that's why you complain so much.' Ellen, you see, was getting pretty angry. Then, Mrs. Trenton said, Beesley ate a little of the bread, and began to complain again. 'This bread's sour,' said he, and with that he raised a piece nearly to his nose, 'it's as sour as anything can be!'</p> 
               <p>"'It isn't sour either,' said Ellen; 'there never was sweeter bread in the world, it's <emph>you</emph> that's <emph>sour!</emph>'</p> 
               <p>"'I tell you this bread <emph>is</emph> sour, and you needn't deny it,' said he, 'it's so sour I can smell it. Who made this bread?'</p> 
               <p>"'<emph>I did; sir!</emph>' said Ellen.</p> 
               <p>"'Well, I <emph>thought</emph> so,' said her husband; 'why didn't you take lessons of Miss Blackey, before you sent her off? (he went on to say) we had <emph>good</emph> bread while <emph>she</emph> was here-that nigger wench could beat you all to nothing.' Wasn't Ellen mad enough then I wonder? I can see how her eyes must have snapped when she give him back.</p> 
               <p>"'As it <emph>happened,</emph> Mr. Beesley,' said she, 'that girl didn't make a loaf of bread while she was here, I did all the baking myself; but I tell you <emph>now,</emph> once for all, I have baked the <emph>last</emph> loaf of bread I ever <emph>shall</emph> bake for <emph>you,</emph> sir; I shall leave you to look after yourself, and shall go home this very night.'</p> 
               <p>"'The sooner the better,' said Beesley; 'I'm as tired of you as you are of me; but I ain't scared-I've heard you talk before-couldn't hire you to go.' And then (Mrs.<pb n=""/> Trenton said) he jumped up from the table and went into the street.'</p> 
               <p>"And so she left him, did she?" asked Blanche.</p> 
               <p>"Yes," returned Kate, "as soon as he was gone, she got her best clothes, and her silver, and all of her table linen together, and crowded them into a couple of trunks, and then she and the little girl dragged them over to a neighbor's, and after that she went home."</p> 
               <p>"Where was Mr. Beesley's clerk?" asked Mrs. Belton; "I thought one of his clerks boarded there."</p> 
               <p>"One of them <emph>did,</emph> and was at the table and heard the whole of it," answered Kate; "but he went out directly after Mr. Beesley. Now who would have thought Beesley was such a man!" continued Kate. "Don't I wish he was my husband though!"</p> 
               <p>"It's a lucky thing you didn't take him, Kate," said Mrs. Belton, giving her daughter a sly wink, (for she had always represented to Blanche, that Kate had discarded him in consequence of some unamiable quality she had suddenly discovered in the gentleman,) "for he has turned out pretty much as I always thought he would; I always said he wouldn't make <emph>Ellen Trenton</emph> a good husband from the first."</p> 
               <p>"I don't pity Ellen much," said Mrs. Lawrence, "for she had no business to marry him; she must have known he didn't love her. I heard that she and her father did all the courting themselves."</p> 
               <p>"That's a mistake," said Blanche, "for I have heard from a reliable source. that Ellen did not fancy the gentleman, and<pb n="428-429" xml:id="VAC5768-00000211"/> was with difficulty persuaded to marry him. I do not think the marriage has ever been, or ever could become a happy one under the circumstances," she proceeded; "for Ellen is very passionate, and not at all calculated to bear with such a disposition in a husband, even if she entertained a strong affection for him."</p> 
               <p>"I shouldn't <emph>want</emph> to be so good tempered as to put up with <emph>such</emph> treatment as hers," returned Kate; "<emph>I wouldn't</emph> do it either! just let Mr. Lawrence attempt to 'act up' in <emph>that</emph> fashion if he thinks best! In the first place I'll never give him a chance, for I don't mean to bother <emph>myself</emph> with housekeeping; but if I ever <emph>do,</emph> and he should try to play up Beesley, I reckon he'd never call me his meek little Kate again."</p> 
               <p>"Does he call you so?" asked Blanche, with a slight emphasis.</p> 
               <p>"O yes,-at least he often <emph>did</emph> before we were married; and he <emph>thought</emph> so too <emph>then,</emph> for if I <emph>hadn't</emph> made him think I was as tame as a kitten, I shouldn't have got him to <emph>this</emph> day."</p> 
               <p>"I think Ellen did well to leave her husband, don't you Blanche?" said Mrs. Belton, who was anxious to change the turn the conversation appeared to be taking, by recurring to their former subject.</p> 
               <p>"I think they were very unwise to marry in the first place," replied Blanche; "but that being done, I really think, if they cannot exercise a spirit of forbearance, and live together without constant altercation, the best course they could take would be to separate at once."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"But you don't blame Ellen for getting provoked, do you?" inquired Kate. "You don't think she ought to put up with such abuse do you?"</p> 
               <p>"I don't censure her for feeling displeased and hurt, certainly, if the circumstances are as you have been informed," answered Blanche; "but you must remember there are two sides to every story: were we to hear the husband's statement, perhaps we might conclude that Ellen had been the most to blame in this matter. Mrs. Trenton would naturally be inclined to believe her daughter's story, which I suppose was all she had to depend upon in this case."</p> 
               <p>"No, there you are mistaken," said Mrs. Lawrence. "Mrs. Trenton told me she had <emph>not</emph> depended on Ellen's account alone; for Henry Bently (Mr. Beesley's clerk you know, who was at the table and heard the whole) gave exactly the same account of the quarrel that Ellen had done; Mr. Trenton questioned him about it; and you know Henry is too honest to misrepresent in the least. Beesley don't deny it either, for he told Mr. Trenton this morning, that if Ellen would come back, and not make a town-talk of the thing, he presumed they would get along better for the future. He said his appetite was poor, and he presumed things didn't taste to him as they did to other people; but, that if Ellen would come back and try to please him, he thought they would have less trouble hereafter. So you see it's likely we have got the right of the story. You certainly can't blame Ellen <emph>now,</emph> for <emph>you</emph> are the very <emph>last</emph> person that would be willing to put up with such treatment from a husband."</p> 
               <pb n="430-431" xml:id="VAC5768-00000212"/> 
               <p>"I should not <emph>like</emph> it I know," returned Blanche; "and as I said before, I do not blame Ellen for feeling displeased and wounded; but she ought to consider that Mr. Beesley has, without doubt, discovered faults in her, which have interfered, perhaps, as much with his domestic happiness, as this unpleasant disposition of his, has with hers; she ought to reflect upon this, and in view of it, be more willing to bear with and forgive him. If she really loved her husband, she would not think of parting with him for such a cause, however much unhappiness it might occasion her."</p> 
               <p>"But suppose, Blanche, <emph>you</emph> were Mrs. Beesley instead of Ellen, and he should treat <emph>you</emph> as he has treated her, what would you do?-now be honest,-you know you are as independent-spirited as any woman alive!"</p> 
               <p>"No, I don't <emph>know</emph> that, Kate," answered Miss Rathbone; "but I am willing to tell you candidly what I think I should do, if situated as Ellen is. In the first place, I should studiously avoid giving my husband just occasion to complain of me; I would endeavor to please him in all things, as far as I could do so, and still retain my self respect; but, if after all, he was fault-finding to the extent Mr. Beesley is represented to be, I would talk with him seriously, but at the same time affectionately, on the subject; I would tell him how much pain this conduct occasioned me, and how willing, and even anxious I was to please him, if possible. If he had a particle of true affection for me remaining, I am sure he would not after this wilfully persevere in such a course; but if, by reason of his continued fault-finding, I became convinced<pb n=""/> vinced that he entertained little or no affection for me, I should still remember that I had taken him for better or worse, and endeavor to bear my trials with Christian patience; but, if like Ellen, I possessed a temper that I either could not, or would not control, and my husband had no patience to expend on me, I should think the sooner we separated the better it would be for both parties."</p> 
               <p>"Dear me, Blanche, what a cringing wife you would make, after all, if you are in earnest in what you say!" exclaimed Mrs. Lawrence; "now <emph>I</emph> never pretended to stand up for woman's rights in my life, as <emph>you</emph> have done; but nobody would catch <emph>me</emph> humbling <emph>myself</emph> to my husband like <emph>that!</emph> I don't believe <emph>you</emph> would do it either, 'come case in hand.' But you can't be in earnest <emph>I</emph> know."</p> 
               <p>"I certainly never was <emph>more</emph> so," returned Blanche; "and I assure you, I consider it <emph>one</emph> of woman's rights to practice forbearance towards all with whom she may be associated in life; to render good for evil; and in every <emph>suitable</emph> way, to strive for the things that make for peace. There are many ways I think in which she may exercise these virtues, without degrading herself in the least; indeed, so far from its <emph>degrading her,</emph> it actually elevates her far above the man, whose conduct is such as to render the exercise of these virtues on the part of his wife necessary.</p> 
               <p>"I think Blanche is right," said Mrs. Belton. "Who is that coming here?" she continued, quickly, after casting a glance in the direction of a window that looked out upon the street. "Look quick, girls, while she is shutting the gate!"</p> 
               <pb n="432-433" xml:id="VAC5768-00000213"/> 
               <p>"It's that awful old maid, Miss Travers!" exclaimed Mrs. Lawrence. "What on earth is she coming <emph>here</emph> for?"</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Dear me, I don't know!</emph>" replied Mrs. Belton, rising hurriedly from her seat. "I must get off this soiled cap, or the prim thing 'll go into fits! for mercy's sake, Kate, pick up those bits and shreds from the carpet! Blanche, dear, won't you arrange those chairs? the old lady will be <emph>horrified</emph> if she finds anything out of place?"</p> 
               <p>These requests were but just complied with, when a neatly-dressed, pleasant-looking lady, not over forty-eight years of age, was ushered into the room.</p> 
               <p>"Why!-how do you do Miss Travers?" exclaimed Mrs. Belton, advancing to meet her guest, and taking her cordially by the hand. "What a stranger you are!-take this easy chair," she continued, after the lady had exchanged brief salutations with her niece and daughter. "Kate, dear, bring a footstool for Miss Travers-this chair tips so far back. How is your health <emph>now,</emph> Miss Travers?"</p> 
               <p>"Very good indeed, thank you," answered the lady, with a bland smile. "Mrs. Lawrence," she added quickly, "pray don't trouble yourself for the stool, I can easily dispense with it-can stop only a moment or so at longest."</p> 
               <p>"It's no trouble," said Kate, with a pleasant smile, placing the stool at Miss Travers' feet.</p> 
               <p>"Are <emph>you</emph> quite well?" continued Miss Travers.</p> 
               <p>"Perfectly well," answered Kate.</p> 
               <p>"I am very glad to hear it," said the lady; "there are so many sick now, it really seems uncommonly pleasant to<pb n=""/> see a person in the enjoyment of perfect health. Blanche, I think, is looking better than I have seen her for some time," continued Miss Travers, "the roses on her cheeks are not quite as pale as they used to be; your health <emph>has</emph> improved, has it not Blanche?'</p> 
               <p>"O yes, I am now very well," replied Miss Rathbone. "Have you heard from Mr. Sanford's lately?" she asked.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I have just left there; the Doctor thinks little Mary can live but a very short time. Poor Mrs Sanford is almost down herself; her trouble, I fear, is killing her fast. What a pity it is, that either Sanford or Beesley ever came to this town-I suppose you have heard that Ellen has left her husband?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes," said Blanche, "Kate has just been telling me about it; where did you hear of it?"</p> 
               <p>"My nephew told me early this morning. He has been clerking it for Beesley, and boarding in his family, so he heard the whole conversation. He says it never was his misfortune to live in a family before were there was such constant discord, but that in the dispute of <emph>last</emph> evening, Mr. Beesley was, in his opinion, far the most to blame; and from his account, I should think Mr. Beesley's conduct then, towards his wife, was almost too insulting to bear. It's a pity for people to marry, if they can't live together in peace."</p> 
               <p>"That's what I think!" said Blanche.</p> 
               <p>"You were all at the wedding this morning, I suppose?" continued Miss Travers.</p> 
               <pb n="434-435" xml:id="VAC5768-00000214"/> 
               <p>"Yes,-that is, Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence and myself;" answered Blanche. "There were but few invited."</p> 
               <p>"So I understood. Well, I hope they may live long and happily together, for certainly a more worthy couple never were united. But I must be going," she continued, rising; "I called to see if any of you could watch with me at Mr. Sanford's to-night; the child is very sick, and requires good nursing." Blanche immediately offered her services; and then Miss Travers took her leave.</p>

               <p>NINE o'clock found Miss Travers and Blanche at their post in the sick-room. Mrs. Sanford, who had just hushed her youngest child to sleep, (an infant of ten months.) entered the apartment soon after their arrival, and seated herself by the bedside of her sick child. Her face was very pale, and an expression of intense sorrow and anxiety rested upon it; her figure had become much attenuated, and the tones of her voice were melancholy in the extreme.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>She had been seated but a short time, when a noise, as of several persons entering in the room she had just left, caused her to start from her chair to her feet, and immediately the loud, rude tones of her husband's voice, were plainly heard.</p> 
               <p>"Bell!-Bell!-where are ye?-come here this minute!" were the words that fell upon every ear, disturbing even the invalid child that had lain for hours in a death-like stupor.</p> 
               <p>An expression of mingled mortification and anguish crossed Mrs. Sanford's face, and after pressing a hasty kiss on the brow of the little sufferer, she hurried from the room.</p> 
               <p>Though Bella had been particular to close the door after her as she passed, every word uttered was distinctly heard by the ladies; and while their hearts swelled with pity for the wretched wife, their abhorrence for the unprincipled and tyrannical husband became too intense to admit of description.</p> 
               <p>Sanford had recently become very intemperate, and it was evident that himself, and the three companions he had brought home with him, were now under the influence of some intoxicating beverage.</p> 
               <p>"You've come at last, have ye?" he said, as Bella entered the room. "<emph>This</emph> is my wife, Snowdown-Beetly and Melt have seen her before:-don't look much as she used to when I married her, there wasn't a prettier girl in Elville, or anywhere else, than she was <emph>then!</emph> she was a <emph>plaguy</emph> pretty woman, gentlemen! she was indeed, Snowdown!"</p> 
               <p>"Ye-s I-heerd-(hic)-that she was a splen-splendid creature; but (hic) she's a leetle too pale-(hic)-paleish to<pb n="436-437" xml:id="VAC5768-00000215"/> look downright (hic) pretty. Now what's the mat-mat-matter with her, Sanford?"</p> 
               <p>"Nothing but tending baby, and fretting herself to death if a flea bites one of the youngsters, or they have a little headache. Here, Mrs. Sanford, don't go off, you've staid in <emph>that</emph> room long enough. Who's in there?"</p> 
               <p>"Miss Travers and Miss Rathbone-they came to watch with poor little Mary to-night."</p> 
               <p>"Pshaw! she don't need any watchers!-but I s'pose you wouldn't sleep a wink if you hadn't somebody here!-you'll spoil every decent look you have left, watching over that child-there's no need of it at all I know; your eyes are as red as can be! I want to know if you have been whining over her again?"</p> 
               <p>"Mary is <emph>very</emph> sick, Mr. Sanford; I think she will die, and I suspect Miss Travers thinks so too. Let me go back."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Confound</emph> Miss Travers! <emph>that</emph> old maid knows nothing about it! I've no doubt but the child will be well enough in a day or two, if you don't <emph>scare</emph> her to death. No, you shan't go back for I want you to get a nice warm supper for these gentlemen and me, in double quick time! Call up your young Irish to help ye if you want any help."</p> 
               <p>"She went to bed sick to-night, Mr. Sanford, and I had rather not disturb her; besides, there is nothing in the house <emph>now</emph> to make a warm supper of, and the fire is all out in the kitchen."</p> 
               <p>"Well, well! get what there is! Melt, you are the youngest, s'pose <emph>you</emph> take this dollar and go out and get a<pb n=""/> slice or two of ham and some eggs! <emph>you</emph> know where to go! Lucky thing I won that dollar, if I hadn't I should have been clear out of change just now."</p> 
               <p>"Don't we want a bottle or so of 'the critter,' too?"</p> 
               <p>"I've <emph>got</emph> some prime old wine in the cellar yet, we'll have a nice supper, don't be afraid-only hurry back Melt, for you know we have an engagement at twelve. You can go and build up a fire while he is gone, Bell."</p> 
               <p>"No no, don't send her away <emph>yet!</emph>" exclaimed a voice, which the ladies conjectured belonged to Beetly. "You know you promised I might have a kiss to-night, and I'll be--if I don't hold you to your bargain: she's a splendid looking woman yet, by ginger, or I wouldn't say so. I think I'd better take the kiss <emph>now,</emph> before Melt comes back: what do you say, Sanford? you were a witness to our bargain, Snowdown?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes,-it was a fa'r enough (hic) bargain, it was; 'twas fa'r 'pon honor (hie). I'd-I'd-stick (hic) stick him to it!"</p> 
               <p>"I shall adhere to my agreement," said Sanford; "you can kiss her twice, if you like."</p> 
               <p>"Hands off!-don't you <emph>touch</emph> me, sir!" exclaimed Mrs. Sanford, in unusually resolute tones."</p> 
               <p>"Excuse me, ma'am-but I must have <emph>one</emph> kiss at least, you know your husband promised it!"</p> 
               <p>"Get away! get away! don't you presume to come near me!" reiterated the insulted woman.</p> 
               <p>"Bell, don't make such a confounded fool of yourself," said Sanford, sharply; "let him kiss you-I <emph>command</emph> it!-<pb n="438-439" xml:id="VAC5768-00000216"/> he won't hurt you!-Never mind her, Beetly." Then followed a scuffle, and a half-suppressed scream, succeeded by peals of laughter, in which Sanford's voice was prominent, and shouts of "Bravo!"-"Bravo!"</p> 
               <p>Blanche, in her excitement, had risen to her feet, and would have opened the door and rushed to Bella's side, had not Miss Travers prevented her.</p> 
               <p>"Do not venture out there, they will insult you too," she said, "and you can do Mrs. Sanford no good by going."</p> 
               <p>Blanche was soon glad she had listened to her friend, for after a few moments, she heard her own name mentioned in a manner that convinced her that, had she placed herself in their way, she might have been treated with even less respect than Bella.</p> 
               <p>"Is this Miss Rathbone, that your wife said was in the other room, an old maid too?" asked one of Sanford's companions.</p> 
               <p>"She is old enough to <emph>begin</emph> to call her so, I s'pose," replied Sanford, "for she must be pretty near thirty years old by this time; but she don't look a whit over two or three and twenty; she is a plaguey good-looking girl too, and is downright smart; but she is as spirited and wilful as a young colt. I should like to have the taming of such a creature though, there would be real excitement in it."</p> 
               <p>"Pity you are married, Sanford; but if you wasn't and could get her, do you s'pose you could manage her as easily as you have your wife?"</p> 
               <p>"Not quite as easily," returned Sanford, "for she would<pb n=""/> not at first be willing to submit to bit and bridle, and no doubt would resist quite a while; but <emph>I</emph> could 'make her know her master' at last She'd 'come to,' after awhile, and be as submissive as you please."</p> 
               <p>"I'd-I'd-(hic)-like to see-(hic)-her," hiccupped Snowdown, who appeared rather more affected by his potations than any others of the company, "let's all go (hic) in there."</p> 
               <p>"We would, if it wasn't for that confounded Miss Travers," answered Sanford, "we would go in and help ourselves to a kiss all around, before she could say Jack Robinson; 'twould be such fun to see her flounce, so we'd do it, if it wasn't for the old lady."</p> 
               <p>"O let us go anyway," said Melt, who had returned in time to hear Snowdown's proposition; "let's go in, who's afraid of that old maid-I a'n't-we'd kiss her too, so she needn't be <emph>jealous!</emph>" This remark was followed by a loud peal of laughter in one room and the blanching of cheeks in another, for the ladies began to fear lest they should attempt to carry out this proposition. "Come Sanford, let's go," continued Melt.</p> 
               <p>"I tell you it won't do," answered Sanford, impatiently; "I presume Miss Travers would tear our eyes out if we attempted to go near <emph>her,</emph> or Blanche Rathbone either; and then they would scream the whole village up, in no time at all; no boys it won't do, we've had kissing enough for one night. Bella will whine from now 'till next week, I suppose, because <emph>she</emph> has been kissed, (I dare say she is crying over<pb n="440-441" xml:id="VAC5768-00000217"/> the cooking-stove <emph>now,</emph>) so I guess we'd better let the rest alone. Besides, I must take out our ham and eggs to Bella, and hurry her up a little, or we sha'n't have supper to-night."</p> 
               <p>At length Sanford and his respectable associates left the house, and directly after Mrs. Sanford re-entered the sickroom and proceeded to the bedside of her child.</p> 
               <p>"How is she now?" she inquired with a trembling voice; but without turning her face towards either of the ladies.</p> 
               <p>"She is no better, we fear," replied Miss Travers.</p> 
               <p>"Will she die?" questioned the mother, anxiously.</p> 
               <p>"Her life is in the hands of the Lord, with Him all things are possible," answered Miss Travers.</p> 
               <p>"Dear little Mary!" sobbed poor Bella, leaning over the child that heeded her not, "how gladly would your wretched mother die for you, if she could! My poor heart is crushed-broken-<emph>dead</emph>-long ago, why can't my body die too?" she continued passionately, and turning towards Miss Travers (who was now sitting near her) as she spoke.</p> 
               <p>Instantly Miss Travers extended her arms, and in another moment the sorrow-stricken wife was folded within them, her head pillowed upon the sympathizing breast of her maiden friend, and her tears flowing rapidly.</p> 
               <p>For a few moments Bella wept without restraint; then, becoming more calm, she poured out a tale of suffering and wrong that filled the hearts of her attentive listeners with the deepest commiseration.</p> 
               <p>"Oh! Blanche," she exclaimed, "how bitterly I am punished for the folly and wilful blindness of my younger years;<pb n=""/> Heaven only knows how deeply I have repented of them. I once said that I thought I would sooner die than lead a single life; but now I am bound in a yoke that is dragging me down to the grave. I feel that I cannot much longer endure this living death.</p> 
               <p>"Why not leave him, and return to your old home?" asked Blanche. "Your parents will receive you, will they not?"</p> 
               <p>"I think not," replied Mrs. Sanford; "they once offered me a home with them, but I refused it; though they assured me if I did so, I must expect nothing more from them."</p> 
               <p>"They cannot refuse to sympathize with you <emph>now,</emph>" said Miss Travers; "I think they would receive you."</p> 
               <p>"I have no right to expect sympathy from them," returned Bella: besides, I have three children now, and I could not endure separation from any one of them, should Mr. Sanford be disposed to take them from me (if the <emph>Lord</emph> takes poor Mary, I of course must submit); nor could I think of troubling my parents, who are getting old, with such a family, even if they were willing to receive us. No, Blanche, I must bear all the trouble that may be visited upon me until the end. My path was of mine own choosing, and I must walk in it yet a little longer. But, Blanche-Miss Travers, when I am laid in my grave, you may, if you please, endeavor to interest my parents in the welfare of their motherless grand-children."</p> 
               <p>"We will always do whatever we can for you and your children, Bella-will we not Miss Travers?"</p> 
               <pb n="442-443" xml:id="VAC5768-00000218"/> 
               <p>"Certainly my dear, most certainly."</p> 
               <p>It was now near morning, and after some difficulty the ladies succeeded in persuading Bella to retire and seek a little repose.</p> 
               <p>During the next day, Blanche and her maiden friend held a long conference with Mr. and Mrs Crawford, who immediately decided to offer Bella and her children a home with them; but concluded not to agitate the subject while little Mary was so ill.</p> 
               <p>A few days and the little sufferer's eyes were closed forever, and shortly after its interment, Mr. Sanford was arrested on a charge of forgery, of which he was finally convicted, and sentenced to several years imprisonment, and Bella with her remaining children removed to the home of her childhood.</p> 
               <p>After about a month's separation, Mr. and Mrs. Beesley in some way reconciled matters between them, and re-commenced house-keeping. Let us hope that they may live more amicably together hereafter.</p> 
               <p>In due time Mr. and Mrs. Lee returned to Elville, but their union is of too recent a date for us to favor our readers with a chapter on their married life. We think it safe, however, to conclude that so devoted a son and brother as Charlie Lee, could hardly fail of making a good and an affectionate husband, and we fear not to predict that Nettie will be to him an equally excellent wife.</p>
