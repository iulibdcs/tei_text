                     <p>Whoever read the New York evening papers on the 28th of February, 186—,
                        would have found the following item under big-type heading that any
                        night-editor would have envied: <q>
                           <p>"IMMENSE ROBBERY!<lb/> "UPWARD OF $100,000 STOLEN.<lb/> "ARREST OF A
                              CLERK.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>"There was great excitement in Wall street, and everywhere in the shadow of
                        Trinity to-day, in consequence of a most gigantic burglary having been
                        committed in the banking establishment of Mr. Andrew Van Kieft, lately
                        located in the splendid new 'Prince Albert stone' building on Broadway near
                        Liberty street.</p>
                     <p>"Some thieves, extraordinarily daring and skillful, managed to enter the
                        office, and by forcing a steel safe (believed to be impenetrable) made
                        themselves masters of the enormous sum of $100,000 in bills on various
                        banks, sterling notes, etc., etc.</p>
                     <p>"Officers Hall and Newlife were especially called in at once, and, it is
                        said, have found a clue to the mystery. One account states that a clerk in
                        the establishment, occupying a high place of trust, has been arrested, as no
                        doubt his accomplices will be before long."</p>
                     <p>For half a week Gotham, Brooklyn, and Jersey City talked of nothing but the
                        great haul. Bankers and merchants began to look sharper after their
                        securities, and cashiers who did a little "on the loose" kept away from
                        their secret haunts for fear eyes might be on them. But other events
                        happened. One of the Hanlons sprained his wrist while trying to execute a
                        marvellous feat; there was a big fire up town; the treble of the
                        Calathumpian negro minstrels turned out to be a girl; the ballet at Niblo's
                        had a new change of their flimsies; somebody's Lexington colt was going
                        "over" to run in the English Derby; and the "great robbery" was let
                        slip.</p>
                     <p>Now, the reporters were not quite right. Upward of a hundred thousand
                        dollars were abstracted from Mr. Van Kieft's steel safe, it is true, but not
                        in the manner indicated. An employe had also been arrested, but no definite
                        charge could be brought against him. The theft remained, if not
                        inexplicable, at least unexplained.</p>
                     <p>But we have found the truth out, and it is so attractive, so thrilling, that
                        even our pen can hardly dull its brilliancy or fail to pierce the mysterious
                        shadows.</p>

                  <div type="chapter">
                     <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                     <head type="sub">THE FAST CASHIER—THE DISCOVERY—PAYABLE ON DEMAND—HOW TO WHIP
                        THE D—— AROUND THE STUMP—WHICH OF THE TWO?</head>
                     <p>Van Kieft, made his first great success when the California fever broke out,
                        and since his business had kept on increasing, so that he could well afford
                        to have, as he did, the handsomest building on the sunny side of Broadway,
                        look where you might, from the peanut-stands against the Hamilton ferry
                        railings to the Worth statue.</p>
                     <p>He had tried hard to buy the corner lot, but it was not in the market. He
                        had to content himself with the next best situation in the block.</p>
                     <p>The basement was let out to an exchange broker, an old clerk of Van Kieft,
                        who was thus favored by being set up in business; and he caught a good many
                        loaves and fishes too small for those up stairs to notice.</p>
                     <p>You went up five broad steps, passed through a handsome oak doorway with
                        swinging doors,<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC8328-00000003"/> almost all of a grand
                        glass-plate worth figuring in Taylor's window-sashes, and entered a fine
                        hall. The walls and ceiling were as carefully finished as those of a Madison
                        Avenue house, and the fittings in the way of desks and counter were as
                        choice as parlor furniture. It quite made it a pleasure for you to pay in
                        money, when you had to lay it down on walnut slabs as polished as a
                        piano-cover, and receive your bank book with A. V. K. printed on the vellum
                        cover, and the entry made with a gold pen dipped in a thirty-five-dollar
                        ebony inkstand.</p>
                     <p>Two-thirds up the hall a glass partition ran clean across, making separate
                        offices for the cashier and tellers.</p>
                     <p>To the right a staircase went to the top of the house, where the porter and
                        watchman lived. To the left a grand flight of steps, carpeted with the
                        patent "gutta-rubber-noiseless-Brussels-percha-flooricon," led up to the
                        second floor.</p>
                     <p>Hereon were the banker's private and reception rooms, where he and his
                        moneyed cronies cracked English walnuts and swallowed curious port, as they
                        devised plans of operation by which bulls could be dehorned or bears
                        beclawed as the case might be.</p>
                     <p>Here were also strong rooms for keeping the books and papers, the private
                        ledger, and the safe-room.</p>
                     <p>There was another safe below, in the cashier's office.</p>
                     <p>But the second-floor one was built into the wall, and the room window was
                        blinded neither more nor less closely than a monitor's port-hole. Thick
                        plates of chilled steel strengthened the room door, and a range of bars
                        enough to make a Tombs prisoner shudder, striped the wall in a part where
                        the chimney ran up and down past the chamber.</p>
                     <p>Not only had its builders seen that the steel safe was unshakably cemented
                        into the wall, but they had added enormous clamps that would have laughed at
                        a New Mexican earthquake trying to make them spring an inch or give a hair's
                        breadth.</p>
                     <p>A glimpse of such precautions around the strong-box was enough to make the
                        fellow whose ideas are bounded by dreams of a full wallet "lay down and lay"
                        forever.</p>
                     <p>Yet, for, all its size, this triumph of smithery required only a pretty
                        little key to open its massive door. But then the tiny key had the least of
                        the work to do. Five moveable steel knobs, on which were enameled with black
                        all the letters of the alphabet, formed especially the strength of the
                        ingenious lock.</p>
                     <p>There was no use of putting in the dainty key unless you had first arranged
                        the letters on the knobs in the same order they held when the door had been
                        locked.</p>
                     <p>As usual, this arrangement was a word which was changed every now and then.
                        It was known only to Mr. Van Kieft and his cashier. Each of them had a
                        key.</p>
                     <p>With such a safe, if you had Miss Coutts' wealth added to what the King of
                        Hanover conveyed from his subjects when the Prussians made him quit, you
                        could sleep as careless as any ragged rascal out of jail.</p>
                     <p>The only danger was that a man might forget the "Open Sesame," when even its
                        builders' men, if called in, would have had a week's work drilling and
                        filing to open the inanimate guardian's looked jaws. As for that, two men
                        were not likely to forget it at the same time.</p>
                     <p>Well, the hateful thawing morning of February 28, 186-, made the employed
                        people of Van Kieft's establishment a trifle late coming down town.</p>
                     <p>Yet, by half past nine, all were pretty well settled in their places.</p>
                     <p>It was then that, coming up the hill through the sloppy mire, from the Post
                        Office, a rather old man, very dark complexioned, dressed in black, stamped
                        up the steps, wiped the slush off his boots on the cocoanut matting, and
                        came in to the counter.</p>
                     <p>Half-a-dozen quill drivers were spattering the ink about as if for a
                        wager.</p>
                     <p>The man asked for the cashier.</p>
                     <p>"What cashier?" says the paying teller, combing his weak mustache with his
                        porcupine penholder.</p>
                     <p>"The head man," returned the military gent, as if he was not to be joked
                        with.</p>
                     <p>He was told that the cashier had not come in yet, and that, anyhow, office
                        hours were from ten till four, as he might see by the opaque white letters
                        on the plate glass of the door. The information appeared to discomfort the
                        new comer considerably.</p>
                     <p>"As I had a conversation yesterday with Mr. Van Kieft," he observed in a
                        cold tone that bordered on impertinence, "I thought I should find some one
                        here to attend to me. I'm Colonel Girard Haviland Manager of the Shiners'
                        Bay Iron Works. I've come to draw $60,000 banked here by my late brother,
                        who left all his property to me. I'm surprised that no such orders were left
                        about it."</p>
                     <p>Neither the speaker's name—colonels being plenty—nor the amount he was going
                        to draw out—big figures being common around Wall street—seemed to affect the
                        teller and the other clerks.</p>
                     <p>"The cashier is not here," observed the former again, "and that's not my
                        department."</p>
                     <p>"Send one of the boys to Mr. Van Kieft, then."</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Van Kieft doesn't come down town so early."</p>
                     <p>"Well if I must. I must. I'll take breakfast while I'm out, and look in
                        again."</p>
                     <p>Off he went, without the least bit of a "good-day."</p>
                     <p>"He's not very polite for a colonel," said the cashier, pulling his
                        moustache; "very likely some conductor picked his pocket of his manners
                        coming down in the cars. I say, Whimple, what an unlucky fellow he is, for
                        there's Prosper getting down from a South Ferry stage this very minute."</p>
                     <p>Indeed, a different sort of man came up the front steps and passed through
                        the doorway, to kick the snow off against the huge stove. He was the
                        principal cashier, Prosper Roadside; a tall, brown haired young dasher of
                        less than thirty, with dark blue eyes. He was dressed very stylishly for a
                        bank clerk, and would have been a picture to look at, only for his imitating
                        the pink-faced swells of the British Consul's staff, and wearing a used-up,
                        cold and had-enough-thank'-ee air that all but spoilt his naturally smilling
                        countenance.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, here you are, eh?" said the teller. "There's been somebody for
                        you."</p>
                     <p>"Oh, the manager of the Jersey Iron Works, eh?"</p>
                     <p>"That's the man."</p>
                     <p>"Of course he'll be in again. I knew I'd be late this morning, snow or not,
                        and took my measures accordingly."</p>
                     <p>Prosper had gone on to his office as he spoke, and passed in.</p>
                     <p>"I say, Tom," muttered one of the juniors, "don't he take it cool for a
                        cashier, though. Why Old Van has gone log-rolling him twenty times for
                        coming so late, and he don't mind it more than the statue over
                        Anderson's."</p>
                     <p>Why not, Owny? The governor is as good as a money-bag to him. He can have
                        anything he wants of him."</p>
                     <p>"To be sure, how could he turn up early when he spreads himself like a heavy
                        gold bug among the dancing-girls after they've left the theater at night. Do
                        you remember when we saw him at the 'Garden' Evacuation Day—night, I mean?
                        Didn't he look as if he'd been dug out after having been holed alive?"</p>
                     <p>"He'd been slinging an ugly hand at cards at the Hotel de Blois—and lost,
                        oh! ever so much spending money. Myrtle avenue, Ed's brother in the Bank of
                        the Nation, knew all about it. He told me. He bet fifteen hundred on one
                        turn of the cards."</p>
                     <p>"I wish I had his spending money," sighed the lad of eighteen. If I had his
                        berth, I'd—"</p>
                     <p>He was cut short, for the door at the head of the left-hand staircase flew
                        open, and, with a tottering step, the cashier, appeared coming down into the
                        hall.</p>
                     <p>"Safe—broken open!" he gasped; "there's been a robbery here!"</p>
                     <p>Prosper's white face, his hoarse, choked voice, and his shaking from head to
                        foot expressed so plainly his intense suffering that every pen and ruler was
                        dropped, and all the writers rushed to him.</p>
                     <p>He almost fell into their arms—he could hardly stand, and they helped him to
                        a chair. The rest flocked around him, gabbling any number of questions, and
                        pressing him to explain.</p>
                     <p>"Robbery," they said, "how—what do you mean?"</p>
                     <p>By degrees, Prosper recovered. "The steel safe has been cleaned out of all
                        the cash in the middle partition."</p>
                     <p>"The steel safe?—all?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, three packets of thousands and five hundreds, and one of C's. The four
                        were done up in a sheet of bank post and elastic-banded together—$100,000!
                        gone like a flash!"</p>
                     <p>"It is burglarized, the steel safe?" asked Tom, slipping a word in.</p>
                     <p>"No—the safe's untouched—but last night the money was there, and it is gone
                        this morning."</p>
                     <p>All was hushed save an old, white-headed book keeper, who did not share in
                        the general consternation.</p>
                     <p>"Don't get excited, Mr. Roadside," he said; "only think, Mr. Van Kieft may
                        have moved the place of the cash."</p>
                     <p>The unhappy cashier rose of a sudden to snatch at this straw.</p>
                     <p>"To be sure, Handley—you're right. It must be so——No, no!" he instantly
                        resumed, in a tone of discouragement, "it is not possible. For the last five
                        years that I have had the funds under my charge, Mr. Van Kieft never opens
                        the safe without my being by. Two or three times I've known him to want
                        funds, but he's always sent for me rather than take it away in my
                        absence."</p>
                     <p>So engrossed were the bystanders in this alarming incident, that they did
                        not notice the drawing up of a carriage without and the entrance of two
                        persons, one of whom left the other to her own devices, and stepped forward
                        within the inclosure. It was the banker himself.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Andrew Van Kieft was about fifty, of average size, with grey hair,
                        rather aldermanic, somewhat round-shouldered, like men who have worked hard,
                        and he walked rather ungracefully.</p>
                     <p>Never had one of his actions belied the kindly expression of his
                        countenance. His was an open face, with bright, frank eye, red lips, and a
                        jolly curl to them, reminding one of his Hollandish origin, without his
                        voice, a little thick, having to help the betrayal. He caught some of the
                        babble, for, instead of being rather ruddy as usual, he turned quite
                        pale.</p>
                     <p>"What are you all out of your places for? What are you talking about?" said
                        he, as all drew back respectfully before him. "What has happened?"</p>
                     <p>Van Kietf's voice supplied the cashier with the fictitious energy of great
                        crises. The decisive moment was on hand. He faced his superior, saying,</p>
                     <p>"Sir, having the payment you know of to make this morning, I sent for nearly
                        the whole of it at the National yesterday——"</p>
                     <p>"Why yesterday, sir?" interrupted the banker. "A hundred times I've told you
                        to wait till the day itself."</p>
                     <p>"I know that, sir—I know I've done wrong; but the mischief is done.
                        Yesterday, before leaving, I locked up the money. It's all gone now, and yet
                        the steel safe has not been forced open—"</p>
                     <p>"That is impossible! Good God! You're out of your senses! You're
                        raving!"</p>
                     <p>These words annhilated the one spark of hope. But the very weight of his
                        misfortune gave Prosper, not the coolness of reflected resolution, but that
                        stupor of indifference which follows unexpected catastrophies.</p>
                     <p>It was almost without apparent emotion that he answered:</p>
                     <p>"Unhappily I am not mad—I am not raving. I am telling the truth!"</p>
                     <p>The person who had entered the bank with Van Kieft had gone up the stairs
                        unchallenged by those so deeply interested in this scene.</p>
                     <p>Such calmness, at such a moment, exasperated the banker so far that he
                        caught Prosper by the arm and, shaking him roughly, said:</p>
                     <p>"Speak! speak! who has opened the safe?"</p>
                     <p>"I cannot say."</p>
                     <p>"Now, there's only you and I know the word—we only have keys to it!"</p>
                     <p>The listeners saw a formal accusation in this speech. Nevertheless, the
                        cashier's coolness did not forsake him. He shook off the other's grasp, and
                        said quite slowly,</p>
                     <p>"Truly, sir the money must have been removed by me—"</p>
                     <p>"You scoundrel!"</p>
                     <p>The young man receded, and with his eyes steadfastly bent on those of Van
                        Kieft, added:</p>
                     <p>"Or you!"</p>
                     <p>The banker raised his fist, and none could say what would have happened had
                        not a scuffle at the door without interposed.</p>
                     <p>Spite of the endeavors of the black man, who kept the door and saw to the
                        fires, etc., there was a man who was bound to come in.</p>
                     <p>Indeed he did burst through, all but upsetting the darkey.</p>
                     <p>It was Colonel Haviland.</p>
                     <p>By the silence among the motionless quilldrivers it was easy to see that
                        some life-and-death argument was being debated. But the manager of Shiners'
                        Bay Iron Works was bent on seeing nothing. In his former impertinent tone,
                        he said,</p>
                     <p>"Old Trinity's been striking ten."</p>
                     <p>No one attended to him. He was going to repeat his remark, when he caught
                        sight of the banker. He moved along the counter to face him.</p>
                     <p>"How d'ye do, sir, Mr. Van Kieft?" said he. "I'm glad I've found you in. I
                        was here once before this morning, but your cashier was out of the way and
                        you had not come down town. Anyhow, here I am—though I don't see why your
                        nigger should have held the door against folks coming in. Banks are public
                        institutions, over in Jarsey, anyhow! Just let a gentleman know if there's
                        any objection to my touching my own lawful money."</p>
                     <pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC8328-00000004"/>
                     <p>Van Kieft heard him through, trembling with anger; he had become crimson
                        now, yet he contained himself well.</p>
                     <p>"I beg your pardon, sir," said he; "I will be obliged if you sit down for a
                        few minutes."</p>
                     <p>"A delay? Why you told me yesterday——"</p>
                     <p>"Yesterday, yes. But I've just this moment been told I'm victim of a heavy
                        robbery."</p>
                     <p>Haviland half shut one eye, coarsely.</p>
                     <p>"How long must I wait?" said he.</p>
                     <p>"While one of my clerks goes down Pine street to the bank. Roadside,"
                        continued he, turning to his cashier, "fill out a check on Mercer's, or on
                        Cisco, or on the Third National. Thomas call a back round to the door."</p>
                     <p>Prosper never stirred.</p>
                     <p>"Did you hear me?" repeated the banker, ready to give vent to his
                        ill-humor.</p>
                     <p>The young man started as from a dream.</p>
                     <p>"There will be no use sending," replied he, coldly; this gentleman requires
                        sixty thousand dollars, and there's not anything like that much available of
                        those banks."</p>
                     <p>It looked as if Colonel Haviland had guessed that this answer was coming,
                        for he muttered:</p>
                     <p>"To be sure!"</p>
                     <p>He did not actually speak the words; but by lips, by expression and glance,
                        as much was signified. Evidently he thought the banker and cashier acting
                        beautifully, but still it was acting and not reality.</p>
                     <p>The clerks, after Roadside's reply, did not know what to think.</p>
                     <p>That was because New York had been excited by several huge "financial
                        crashes" that season.</p>
                     <p>Van Kieft had too much experience not to guess what impression Roadside's
                        phase had made: he read the most mortifying doubt in every eye.</p>
                     <p>"Very well, Colonel," said he to Haviland; "if you will have a little
                        patience, I shan't detain you long."</p>
                     <p>He went up the staircase, by which the person who had long since entered
                        with him had flitted and after spending five minutes in his private room,
                        returned with a letter and a roll of papers.</p>
                     <p>"Quick, Mr. Sanderson," he said to the paying teller; "Take my carriage, and
                        take this gentleman with you to Belmont's. Show this letter and get them to
                        endorse these drafts. Then go to——to——Halpiner and Heimer, and say it will
                        be a favor to me for them to convert them into such moneys as the gentleman
                        wishes. Colonel Haviland, obliged to you for your courtesy; Good
                        morning!"</p>
                     <p>The iron-master was clearly disappointed, and seemed to want to try to fend
                        off the results of his impertinence.</p>
                     <p>"My dear sir," he began, "believe me I had no intention to offend. We've
                        been so long in friendly relations that——"</p>
                     <p>"That will do," interrupted the banker; "in business, friends and foes are
                        beside the question. I am in your debt, and you insist on your demand—quite
                        correct. If you go with my clerk, he will give you the cash. Good morning
                        again! And now, young gentlemen," said he to the juniors, "perhaps it will
                        look better if you are at your desks!"</p>
                     <p>In a moment the space before the cashier's office was cleared.</p>
                     <p>The clerks, with their noses down to their books, were apparently wearing
                        out as many pens as the pace of their hands would allow.</p>
                     <p>Still affected by what had transpired, Mr. Van Kieft walked up and down
                        within the glass enclosure, with sundry exclamations escaping from him from
                        time to time.</p>
                     <p>Prosper leaned up against the partition pale, confounded with fixed eyes, as
                        if he had lost even the power of thinking.</p>
                     <p>At last, after a long silence, the banker stopped in the doorway and
                        said:</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Roadside, had you not better step this way?"</p>
                     <p>The cashier silently obeyed, and mechanically went into his office. The
                        other closed the door behind him.</p>
                     <p>"And be pleased to follow me," added the banker.</p>
                     <p>He proceeded by a side door, rarely used, so as to go out into the large
                        room and reach the staircase.</p>
                     <p>When he and the young man were in the strong room, Van Kieft looked
                        around.</p>
                     <p>Nothing in the place spoke of intruders. Everything was in order. The steel
                        safe was open, however, and the side drawers were noted by the banker's
                        informed eyes, not to be unlocked even.</p>
                     <p>Without examining them more closely, Van Kieft turned to his cashier. He had
                        become completely master of himself again, and his face wore its usual
                        expression.</p>
                     <p>"Now, that we are alone, Prosper," he began, "have you nothing to tell
                        me?"</p>
                     <p>The young man started, as though the question had astonished him.</p>
                     <p>"Nothing, sir, that you have not heard," he answered.</p>
                     <p>"What! nothing? Do you persist in sticking to an absurb story, which no one
                        can believe? This is madness. You'll be safer in trusting to me. You are
                        under me, in one way to be sure; but I am your friend, your best friend. I
                        cannot let it slip me that your father recommended you to me some fifteen
                        years ago, and that I have only had praise to give you all the time since.
                        Yes—fifteen years you have been with me. Then I was building my fortune, and
                        you have seen it grow up, stone by stone. As I became richer, I have
                        bettered your position, for, young as you are, you are the longest in my
                        establishment. Every New-Year's I have increased your salary."</p>
                     <p>Prosper had never heard his superior use a softer or more fatherly voice.
                        Deep surprise marked his features.</p>
                     <p>"Tell me," went on the other, "have I not always been as a father to you?
                        From the first day my residence has been open to you. For a long time you
                        spent the evenings and the Sundays with us and my two sons, and my niece,
                        Viandra. But you tired of such a homely life, and one day, a year ago, your
                        visits fell off, and after that——"</p>
                     <p>The remembrances of the past called up by the speaker rushed in a throng
                        upon the hapless cashier's mind, and his hardened heart melting, he burst
                        into tears at this point, and hid his face with his hands.</p>
                     <p>"To a father anything may be spoken," proceeded Mr. Van Kieft, affected by
                        the young man's emotion; "be of good cheer. A father gives not more pardon,
                        but utter oblivion. Do I not know the glittering temptations which beset
                        youth in the great Empire City? There are some thirsts that one catches here
                        that break down the strongest wills. There are hours of the town's midnight
                        when a man loses his mastery of self and acts like a lunatic, without fairly
                        knowing what he does. Speak, my boy, speak!"</p>
                     <p>"What do you want me to say?"</p>
                     <p>"The truth. A really honest man may stumble may fall, but on recovering his
                        footing he will go straight on thenceforth. Tell me, "Yes. I have been
                        dazzled so that my reason quaked and gave way. I am young, and my blood
                        prompts me——"</p>
                     <p>"Not mine!" muttered Prosper.</p>
                     <p>"Poor lad," said the capitalist, sadly; "do you think that I am ignorant of
                        the life you have led for the last year, since you absented yourself from
                        our house? You might have guessed that the older men in my employ are
                        jealous of your having $2,500 a year. Why, you had no sooner bought a piano,
                        a light wagon and fast team, or jewelry, than I was given the figures in an
                        unsigned letter. I could tell you how many nights you have spent at Butt
                        Allen's, and the amounts won or lost. Oh! envy has sharp eyes and long ears.
                        I knew better than to rely on such underhanded bits of cowardice: but I had
                        to learn how the man lived in whom I trusted my fortune and honor."</p>
                     <p>Prosper parted his lips to protest.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, my honor," repeated Van Kieft, in a voice set on edge by resentment
                        and humiliation; "and my credit. It has nearly been ruined this day by that
                        fellow, whom I hardly know, but I guess to be a deadly enemy. What do you
                        think the cash I had to give that Colonel Havil and really cost me? Those
                        papers are regularly sacrificed, let me tell you!"</p>
                     <p>He paused as though in hope of a confession, which did not come.</p>
                     <p>"Prosper, make up your mind to the best course! I am going down stairs, for
                        I must see to my niece, who came with me for shopping. Just look to the safe
                        there again, for I fancy that in your alarm you did not search properly. In
                        the afternoon I will be here again, and I am sure that you will then have
                        recovered—perhaps not all—but at least the bulk of the missing sum. And so,
                        to-morrow, neither you nor I will have a thought of this false alarm."</p>
                     <p>Already the banker was moving toward the door, left ajar; but Prosper held
                        him by the arm.</p>
                     <p>"Your generosity is useless, sir," he said bitterly; "not having taken one
                        cent, I have nothing to return. I looked narrowly—the bills
                           <emph>have</emph> been stolen!"</p>
                     <p>"My poor boy, by whom?"</p>
                     <p>"By all that's sacred, I swear it was not I!"</p>
                     <p>A rush of blood empurpled the banker's face.</p>
                     <p>"What do you mean, sir? To cast the slur on <emph>me?</emph>" he
                        exclaimed.</p>
                     <p>Prosper had bowed his head, and no reply came from him.</p>
                     <p>"So, you dare this much!" cried Van Kieft quite beyond self-control.
                        "Between you and me, Mr. Prosper Roadside, the law shall decide. Heaven
                        being witness that I did all I could to save you, blame yourself for
                        whatever happens. I sent the black round to the custom-house for a
                        detective, and no doubt one has come. Must I call him up?"</p>
                     <p>Prosper nodded, like a man who cares for nothing, and answered in a stifled
                        voice:</p>
                     <p>"Do so, if you please."</p>
                     <p>The banker went out to the head of the stairs looked back by the open door
                        to his cashier, and called down:</p>
                     <p>"Sanderson, if you have returned—or, if Johnson's come back—let the
                        detective know that I would like him to come up this way."</p>

                        "GYPSY"—THE ARREST.</head>
                     <p>USHERED by the negro Johnson, two men came up stairs to Mr. Van Kieft.</p>
                     <p>The porter had found them in a side room at the Custom House, where there
                        were generally some officers semi-detatched, ready and eager for "merchant's
                        service," a paying demand.</p>
                     <p>The principal of the two was under thirty, and yet he seemed much older. He
                        was in plain clothes, was rather gentlemanly than otherwise, and, indeed,
                        walked somewhat indifferently toward the banker. He wore gold-frame
                        spectacles.</p>
                     <p>His companion was a short man, in a black suit, a sort of police-court
                        "shyster," with a ropy black cravat tied in front of a dubious paper
                        collar.</p>
                     <p>"I dare say, sir," said Mr. Van Kieft, bringing them into the strong room,
                        while Johnson reluctantly went down stairs, "that my porter has told what
                        painful event has forced me to have recourse to you?"</p>
                     <p>"The man spoke of a burglary."</p>
                     <p>"A theft, an inexplicable theft, committed in this very room from that steel
                        safe you see there open; the key and secret key-word to which my cashier (he
                        pointed to Prosper) alone has——"</p>
                     <p>This speech seemed to arouse the unhappy cashier out of his deep stupor.</p>
                     <p>"I beg your pardon," said he in a die-away voice, "Mr. Van Kieft
                           <emph>also</emph> has a key, and knew the word."</p>
                     <p>"Of course!"</p>
                     <p>The chief detective could mark by these hasty words that the two men were
                        reciprocally accusing each other. By their own asservations, one of them
                        alone could be the guilty party.</p>
                     <p>Anyhow, the detectives were too well broken in to mask their impressions for
                        anything to betray itself upon their visages. Not a muscle of either
                        moved.</p>
                     <p>However, the chief detective alternately scanned the banker and the cashier,
                        as if from their looks and bearing he would be able to gain some valuable
                        clue.</p>
                     <p>The latter was still pale and as cast down as possible; he leaned against a
                        chair, on which were a couple of books, and one arm hung inert by his
                        side.</p>
                     <p>The other stood aloof from support—was flery red and animated. His eyes
                        sparkled, and he expressed himself with extraordinary violence.</p>
                     <p>"The importance of the loss is considerable," pursued Mr. Van Kieft. "Quite
                        a fortune has been taken—close on to a hundred thousand dollars! Such a
                        robbery might have been attended with the most disastrous consequences to
                        me. There are moments when, for want of such a sum, the strongest houses
                        might be shaken."</p>
                     <p>"Very likely, when there's a run on the bank——"</p>
                     <p>"As you say, Mr.——?"</p>
                     <p>"Didn't I give you a card? Oh! my name's Charles Newlife; this is Mr. Jacob
                        Hall."</p>
                     <p>The little man in black bowed low.</p>
                     <p>"Well, gentlemen, I had a large sum to pay out this day."</p>
                     <p>"Oh, indeed!"</p>
                     <p>There was no mistaking Newlife's tone; his first suspicion was cropping out.
                        The banker perceived it, for he started and very quickly went on:</p>
                     <p>"I met the demand, but at the price of disagreeable sacrifices. I must add
                        that, if my express orders had been carried out, the hundred thousand
                        dollars would not have been in this safe——"</p>
                     <p>"How's that?"</p>
                     <p>"I have been brought up in too good a school, I hope, to keep large sums of
                        ready money here over night. My cashier was told to wait till the last hour
                        before he sent to the National Bank for the cash. I strictly forbade his
                        getting it last night."</p>
                     <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC8328-00000005"/>
                     <p>"Do you hear Mr. Van Kieft, sir?" inquired Newlife of Prosper.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, sir; what Mr. Van Kieft says is perfectly correct," the latter
                        rejoined.</p>
                     <p>Upon this reply, the detective's growing suspicion began to wilt.</p>
                     <p>"At all events, a robbery has been committed. Whom do you suspect? Think he
                        came from outdoors?"</p>
                     <p>The banker hesitated a moment before answering.</p>
                     <p>"No, I don't think so."</p>
                     <p>"I'm sure not," said Prosper.</p>
                     <p>"Well, we'd set to work, by your leave. Mr. Van Kieft," said Newlife; "Hall,
                        just see what you make of it. Something worth booking may not have been
                        noticed by the gentlemen."</p>
                     <p>Jake Hall, often knows as "the Coon," owed his nickname to his nervous
                        activity, quite like a raccoon caged.</p>
                     <p>Short and thin, frail, if anything, he was a good deal stronger and tougher
                        than you'd have guessed. His face was not a picture, with its
                        awfully-turned-up nose, thin lips and small, sharp eyes, twinkling like an
                        intoxicated star.</p>
                     <p>Hall had been five years in the force, three as a "shadow" and burned for a
                        chance. But, alas! his name had only figured in the items, and he'd never
                        had a half a column of "leaded matter" between himself and an illustrious
                        rascal, whom he sought to collar.</p>
                     <p>Before his superior had spoken, he had scanned the room, studied the door,
                        sounded the walls and floor, examined the iron bars.</p>
                     <p>"Well," said he, in a saw-filing voice, "I reckon it'd take a fellow all day
                        to break into here."</p>
                     <p>He turned around.</p>
                     <p>"This door's locked every night, eh?" asked he.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, always. The porter keeps the keys—after I give him this as I leave,"
                        said Roadside.</p>
                     <p>"The porter—that old colored man? Sleeps on the premises, I suppose. He was
                        going down stairs just now. Do you mind calling him up?"</p>
                     <p>"Certainly not."</p>
                     <p>The banker called up, "Gabriel," and in came the porter. He was a
                        trustworthy fellow, who had been ten years with Van Kieft. He knew very well
                        that nobody had a right to suspect him, but when such a huge "spoiling" had
                        happened, he shook like a leaf, and wore an ashy paleness as he
                        appeared.</p>
                     <p>"Where did you sleep last night?" inquired Newlife. "Take your time."</p>
                     <p>"Why, sah! de fust part I had my mattress in de room on dis floor: but
                        Trinity striking eleben, woke me up, and I walked froo the building, spoke
                        to de roundsman on de street, and den I went up 'tairs where I regularly
                        live, sah!"</p>
                     <p>"What time did you go to bed at first?"</p>
                     <p>"It was a little late for me, sah, 'cause I'm an old man. 'Bout ten o'clock.
                        I was down to de front door to see Forty-two's and Twenty-one's racing down
                        to de false alarm at de Atlantic Hotel. I went up, den, and lay down
                        d'reckly, afore the machines come back, sah."</p>
                     <p>"Heard no noise at all last night?"</p>
                     <p>"No, sah—not a mossel. I sleep light, 'cause of the rheumatis; it gibs me a
                        twinge ebery once in awhile. I often wake up if a mouse walks."</p>
                     <p>"So, as far as you can say, you'd assure us that nobody was in the
                        building?"</p>
                     <p>"Last night?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes."</p>
                     <p>"No, sah; I decla'r quite the conterary! Dut's de truff."</p>
                     <p>"Very well, my man," said Newlife, "we shan't want you again. By-the-by, you
                        need not spin any long-winded yarns about what you don't know to the people
                        in the bank."</p>
                     <p>"No, sah; I'se use to holdin' my tongue."</p>
                     <p>"Is Miss Oestervelt there?" asked the banker.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, sah; she come down stairs—wanted to know why you left her alone up
                        here."</p>
                     <p>"Tell her not to be uneasy. I shall be free in a little while."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, sah!" and Gabriel Johnson departed.</p>
                     <p>Hall had conferred with his principal. Then they expressed their wish to see
                        all the rooms on that floor, to try to discover traces of somebody having
                        hidden himself therein during the day in order to make a night sortie.</p>
                     <p>Among the rooms was Van Kieft's private office and a large room opening into
                        it, used for consultations of the nature of railroad directors'
                        meetings.</p>
                     <p>The private office was nicely fitted up. The committee-room was only
                        furnished with a long desk, some leather-backed chairs, and on each side of
                        the fire-place a small writing desk.</p>
                     <p>The office had two doors, one into the big room, the other leading out into
                        the passage for down stairs.</p>
                     <p>With one glance Hall hud taken stock of the sanctum, and seemed somewhat put
                        out by its appearance, as he had not found what he had been expecting.</p>
                     <p>"Let's go on," said he.</p>
                     <p>Newlife seemed to be deep in thought, giving more attention to Prosper than
                        to the banker.</p>
                     <p>However, the two officers and Van Kieft passed into the committee-room.</p>
                     <p>Prosper was left alone in the office. So deep was the disorder of his ideas
                        that he did not understand that his case was getting harder every moment. He
                        had flung down the gauntlet to his employer, and the fight had begun, so
                        that from this out he could not, of his own accord, check or end the
                        consequences of the contest.</p>
                     <p>Without truce or quarter, they were pitted to fight, using every manner of
                        weapon till one of the two should fall, paying with his good fame for the
                        overthrow.</p>
                     <p>In the eyes of justice, which would be the guiltless?</p>
                     <p>Alas, the unlucky young man was too well aware of how unequal the chances
                        were, and the consciousness of his inferiority made him downcast.</p>
                     <p>He never could have believed that his employer would have realized his
                        threats. For in such a proceeding as the present the banker had as much to
                        risk and far more to lose than his clerk.</p>
                     <p>Seated in one of the easy-chairs, Prosper was in a cloud of the most gloomy
                        reflections, when the door giving entrance to the passage by which the party
                        had come was softly opened by a trembling hand. A remarkably fair young lady
                        stepped lightly within.</p>
                     <p>She was rather tall, very pliant of form, and her shawl had fallen down from
                        her shoulders, so as to show the tightly-fitting waist of her walking-dress,
                        revealing the treasures of her shape. Of rich dark complexion, with soft
                        black eyes, her color was the warm glow of the white magnolia, and her curly
                        hair stole out from under her bonnet (for they wore bonnets in this year)
                        down along a neck of the most exquisite design. This was the niece of whom
                        Mr. Van Kieft had spoken—Viandra.</p>
                     <p>Though she had entered so gently, the atmosphere which invisibly and
                        imperceptibly (to all but the <emph>one</emph>) surrounds a young and lovely
                        girl, warned Prosper Roadside that he was not alone now.</p>
                     <p>"Viandra!" he exclaimed.</p>
                     <p>The door behind the maiden creaked a little. She had not thought to close
                        it, and perhaps, the air moved it.</p>
                     <p>The girl blushed redder than a peony, and seemed as if about to run away.
                        But Prosper had darted to her, and something stronger than boarding school
                        teaching made her pause, and present with all grace her fluttering hand.</p>
                     <p>Prosper kissed it respectfully.</p>
                     <p>Then stood they face to face motionless, and confused. So affected were both
                        that they hung their heads, fearing the meeting of each other's gaze; having
                        so much to tell one another that the weight of it bore down their
                        tongues.</p>
                     <p>In the end, Viandra, in a voice almost inaudible, uttered;</p>
                     <p>"You Prosper, you——"</p>
                     <p>This broke the spell.</p>
                     <p>The cashier let fall the hand so white, clinging to his against its owner's
                        will, and it was in the most bitter of tones that he caught up the
                        sentence:</p>
                     <p>"Accused—suspected—of the most shameful, cowardly theft! Prosper, your
                        schoolmate, your playmate, oh, my God!——"</p>
                     <p>"Oh! Yes, yes—not only the people down stairs spoke in strange whispers, but
                        a stranger—a little man in black once more—he wanted to stop me from coming
                        to you—uncle, I mean—"</p>
                     <p>"The officer? gone around they thought I would try to run," said
                        Prosper.</p>
                     <p>"The officer? no doubt! I said I <emph>would</emph> pass—I
                           <emph>must?</emph> I gave him five dollars that I had in my
                        portemonnaie—but Prosper——"</p>
                     <p>Her eyes were filling with tears of compassion—that balm of Gilead which
                        heaven had given bounteously to the women that love and are loved.</p>
                     <p>"Your uncle means to hand me over to the police—before the sun sets, I'll be
                        locked up, I suppose—"</p>
                     <p>Viandra shook her head in sincere affright.</p>
                     <p>"What is it all? I couldn't make out from <emph>their</emph> whispers—I'd
                        suffer all, too, before questioning them—about <emph>you!</emph>"</p>
                     <p>The cashier faltered. It may be he had had the idea of laying bare his heart
                        to Viandra, of opening to her his inmost secrets, but some icy wind froze
                        the rivulet of confidence. He sadly shook his head and answered:</p>
                     <p>"I Thank you for this proof of interest—the last I will doubtless receive
                        from you; but let me be silent and so spare you a grief—spare me the pain of
                        blushing before you!"</p>
                     <p>Viandra put forth her hand imperiously.</p>
                     <p>"Why—oughtn't I know?" she said.</p>
                     <p>"Alas, you will but too soon learn my shame and my misfortune—then, oh,
                        then, you will applaud yourself for what you have so kindly done!"</p>
                     <p>While speaking he pushed her gently, though she resisted no little, and he
                        managed to close the door on her.</p>
                     <p>It was in good time, for Newlife and the banker returned. They had visited
                        all the rooms on the floor, and had heard nothing of the young couple's
                        dialogue.</p>
                     <p>But Mr. Hall had heard for them. The Coon had not let Mr. Roadside he so
                        much to himself as he fancied.</p>
                     <p>"When the fellow's alone," he reasoned, "his jaw will drop, and I'd snap up
                        a smile or a wink that will set me straight."</p>
                     <p>Leaving his companion to take care of Van Kieft, Hall had slipped around by
                        the main passage and posted himself on the lookout.</p>
                     <p>During this time, Miss Viandra Oestervelt (perplexed by the mysterious
                        disorder pervading the house where her few previous visits had shown her
                        everything moving as by clockwork at last got a clue to the mazes. She had
                        pounced upon Johnson, and the colored gent being more talkative than he had
                        tried to make Mr. Newlife suppose, had found out what a grave charge hovered
                        over Prosper Roadside. Then, had she hastened upstairs again, and, meeting
                        Coon Hall, passed him with the bribe.</p>
                     <p>But Hall, guessing something "queer" was in a young lady being so eager to
                        see the cashier, had only taken a V to make his game more certain.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, he had been at the office-door, and nothing that his sharp eyes
                        and ears could notice of the brief interview between the cashier and the
                        maiden had been let pass by them.</p>
                     <p>It is true, that the conversation was full of reticence, but Hall was sharp
                        enough to make out the suppressed information. He only had a suspicion, but
                        even on a suspicion quite a mansion in the air—Fifth avenue sir—can be run
                        up.</p>
                     <p>It never struck him—so quick was he in drawing a plan out on the slightest
                        string of data—that he caught a glimpse of a drama in the past of this
                        couple, unknown to him but shortly before.</p>
                     <p>Jacob Hall, unlike Newlife, only believed in evil.</p>
                     <p>"I'm on it," he thought: "this gay boy loves this young lady, who is some or
                        looks, no mistake! and, as he's prime, she's sweet on him. The old banker
                        don't tumble to this sparking, and not being able to hammer out the knife to
                        cut true love in two,' he's hatched this big robbery-egg to squash the young
                        man out with. It's a 'heavy' bit!"</p>
                     <p>So, according to Coon Hall, the moneyed man had merely robbed himself,
                        making the innocent cashier the victim of the most odious device. However,
                        this idea of the detective could not help Prosper much at the present
                        moment.</p>
                     <p>Jacob Hall, bound to "get his name up," was quite determined to keep his own
                        moves secret.</p>
                     <p>"I'll let the rest sling out their dominoes," he reasoned, "and I'll look
                        after the double-six myself. When, by dint of careful business I've got hold
                        of proofs enough, I'll get out the warrant for the right body."</p>
                     <p>He was delighted; for here was, at last, a "big thing," the crime so long
                        thirsted for, to make him celebrated. Nothing was absent, either in the dark
                        surroundings, in the mystery, or in the romantic and sentimental side
                        represented by the oppressed cashier and the sympathising maiden—Prosper and
                        Viandra.</p>
                     <p>To succeed seemed hard, well-nigh impossible; but Coon Hall had no
                        second-rate opinion of his abilities.</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile, the examination of the premises had been concluded, and the
                        three, Roadside, Van Kieft and Newlife, came along the passage.</p>
                     <p>Hall was at the door of the room of the Steel Safe.</p>
                     <p>"Hallo, Hall! what now?" ejaculated the chief detective.</p>
                     <p>For the little man had a peculiarly lively look on his pinched up features.
                        He merely went into the room, and, prompted by a similar motive, Van Kieft,
                        Prosper and Newlife followed and surrounded him.</p>
                     <p>"Have you found some clue?" inquired the banker.</p>
                     <p>Hall seemed to be annoyed at having let too much of his surprise be
                        seen.</p>
                     <p>"Oh," said he, carelessly, "it's nothing much."</p>
                     <p>"Little or more, it's right we should know," said Prosper.</p>
                     <p>"Why," went on the little men, "in taking a<pb n="10-11"
                           xml:id="VAC8328-00000006"/> last <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coup de
                           oil,</foreign> I've found a proof that this steel safe was freshly opened
                        and closed with some violence and in great haste!"</p>
                     <p>"The deuce, Hall?" said the other officer.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, sir; just here—don't you see the scratch from the keyhole
                        outward?"</p>
                     <p>Newlife took the magnifying-glass (used mostly for examining suspectedly
                        forged bank-bills), retaining his spectacles, and, stooping, long and
                        attentively examined the steel safe. There was clearly to be distinguished a
                        faint thin scrape, which had removed the transparent antirust on a line of
                        half-a-dozen inches.</p>
                     <p>"I see it, but what does it signify!" began Newlife.</p>
                     <p>"Pooh! nothing at all," caught up Coon Hall; "that's just what I said."</p>
                     <p>In fact, he had said so, but he did not think so. This undeniable recent
                        trace had a meaning to his eyes, to which others were blind. It confirmed a
                        figure in his suppositions. He took it for granted that the cashier, if even
                        he was going in for millions, would have had no reason to "hurry up his
                        cakes." On the other hand, the banker, hidden in the building, by means of
                        duplicate (or his usual) keys, moving about on tip-toe, in fear of arousing
                        Johnson, coming to plunder his own safe, would have a thousand reasons to
                        tremble, to hasten to "help himself and quit," any of which would easily
                        make him miss the keyhole with the key in his shaking hand.</p>
                     <p>Resolved to ensnarl the tangled skein all by himself, the little detective
                        wished to hide the full breadth of his conjectures in the same way as he
                        kept hushed on the interview of Viandra with Roadside. And further, he tried
                        to gloss over the former fact.</p>
                     <p>"To my mind," said Jacob to his companion, "no strange person could have got
                        in here. A sneak-thief <emph>might</emph> have slept over night in the
                        house, but—now that Red Leary is in Baltimore, and English Jim in the
                        country—there aint one of them that has keys good enough for these new-style
                        looks. This steel safe here is quite untampered with. There's not a show of
                        drill, Rachett lever, picklock or wedge being tried. Whoever opened it,
                        granting it was opened, knew the 'word' and had a proper key. The men who
                        made the safe must be seen, to ascertain if any of their workmen have been
                        approached, but I don't think anything to affect <emph>this</emph> case will
                        be gained in this quarter."</p>
                     <p>This so formal affirmation by a man whom he knew to be so cunning put an end
                        to the chief detective's hesitation.</p>
                     <p>"And so," observed he, "I only want a word in private with Mr. Ven
                        Kieft."</p>
                     <p>"Certainly," returned the banker.</p>
                     <p>Prosper understood. He quietly and slowly withdrew, and, pausing on the
                        landing, went more slowly still down the stairs.</p>
                     <p>Jacob Hall also went out and followed the cashier, for his mate had made him
                        a sign for him to answer for that man. But Coon had no need of such an
                        intimation to keep up the lookout. His suspicions were too vague, and his
                        desire to succeed too eager for him to consent to letting Prosper go out of
                        his sight.</p>
                     <p>No doubt some of the clerks (though now engaged in the regular business of
                        the day) would have ventured on questioning Roadside as he appeared among
                        them. But the presence of the detective kept them aloof, and in silence the
                        cashier went into his own office.</p>
                     <p>Jacob, pretending carelessness as to his charge, but curiosity as the
                        working of the bank, began to study the paying out and receiving of money,
                        the smoke from the hot-water urn a-top of the stove, the clerks and the
                        customers.</p>
                     <p>Prosper, after apparently only arranging some papers in his room, came out
                        easily and took a seat at a desk, left vacant by some absentee of the staff.
                        Those around him, uneasy at the detective's watching them, spite of his
                        seemingly innocent air, burned to learn the result of the unknown events
                        happening up stairs. But not even one dared to ask.</p>
                     <p>What the gray-heads hesitated to do, however, young Tom risked, himself,
                        with a—</p>
                     <p>"Well, Mr. Roadside?"</p>
                     <p>"Nothing found out yet!" answered he. Then: "Was the young man from Rundle's
                        in?" "No?" "Then, in the afternoon, no doubt, he'll call. If I'm not here
                        he's to have the Mexican dollars done up and labelled in my safe, Mr.
                        Handley."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
                     <p>From consciousness of innocence, from certainty of impunity, from
                        recklessness as to what was coming, the cashier now assumed his customary
                        bearing, a cold English-aping style, which fended others off and had made
                        him many enemies in that house. Of his emotion, lately so great as to make
                        one pity him as one looked, the only traces left were pallor, a brown ring
                        around his red eyes, and the disorder of his locks, still damp with cold
                        perspiration.</p>
                     <p>None of the strangers who came in could have dreamt that the young man
                        sitting there playing with his gold pencil case was under the accusation of
                        a theft, and was all the same as arrested.</p>
                     <p>Next he began to scribble and draw on a blotting-paper pad and little slips
                        of paper, as men will do to kill time; but Jacob saw that he was really
                        writing some lines on one scrap more carefully.</p>
                     <p>"Bockbier und britzels!" muttered Coon, who had almost dropped off to sleep
                        in the silence, "he's spilling the ink about—now we'll learn something, I
                        guess."</p>
                     <p>Prosper folded the scrap into the smallest size possible, and after one
                        quick glance at Hall, more torpid than ever, he tossed it to Tom, with the
                        single word—</p>
                     <p>"Gipsy."</p>
                     <p>This was performed with so much coolness and such rare cunning, that Hall,
                        "a judge of the article," was confounded, wonder-stricken, and even somewhat
                        taken aback.</p>
                     <p>"For young innocence," he thought, "the gent has more nerve than many of the
                        old birds. That comes of a good broughten-up!"</p>
                     <p>Innocence or otherwise, Prosper required much strength of character to put
                        on that imperturbable calmness and to give such a proof of presence of mind;
                        for, on the floor above, his life, his fate, his future, his fortune was
                        being decided! He was only thirty-two!</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile, in the room above, before he took the first step, either from
                        deference quite natural, or in hopes of obtaining some hint by a less formal
                        conversation, Detective Newlife remarked to the moneyed man:</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Van Kieft, we are alone now, and, I can say, there's no room for
                        doubting. That young man has robbed you. I must, in duty bound, take care of
                        him; the captain will settle as to whether he is to beset at large or handed
                        over to a justice."</p>
                     <p>This seemed to deeply affect the hearer, for he was heard to sigh, "Poor
                        Prosper!"</p>
                     <p>The other evinced astonishment.</p>
                     <p>"Up to this day, sir," he went on. "I had the strongest trust in his
                        honesty. I would have confided all my wealth to him. Just now I almost went
                        down on my knees to him to obtain the confession that in a moment of frenzy
                        he had done wrong. I promised him pardon and oblivion. I could not move him
                        more than a rock. I am fond of him, and even now, spite of the vexation and
                        pain he is going to cause me, I cannot feel animosity against him."</p>
                     <p>"'Vexation and pain,'" echoed the detective, as if he did not
                        understand.</p>
                     <p>"What, Mr. Newlife," cried the banker; "ought not justice be even-handed to
                        all? Though I am <emph>the head</emph> of this establishment, and Mr.
                        Roadside is merely a clerk, I don't expect my simple word to go for an oath.
                        I may have defrauded myself; there are examples of it! I shall have to bring
                        my books into court, and explain, under a lawyer's questioning, the whole of
                        my business, private and regular."</p>
                     <p>To be sure, sir, you'll have to be examined; but your well-known
                        standing——"</p>
                     <p>"Alas! he, also, was honest! This morning who would have suspected that I
                        should have been at a loss, for a moment, for several thousands?
                           <emph>Who</emph> would be suspected if I could not prove that my
                        available capital runs to upward of a million—my family's investments, of
                        course, included?"</p>
                     <p>To an honest man the possibility of being suspected is an insult, a burning
                        shame—and the detective saw that the speaker was in pain.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, sir, you needn't be distressed," he remarked; "in a week we'll have
                        enough proof to convict the young man. It's a common case now, since the
                        concert-hall girls are in full swing."</p>
                     <p>The two went down-stairs.</p>
                     <p>Hall woke up with a yawn, and Prosper, without a tremor, and with all the
                        externals of complete insensibility, heard that he must consider himself
                        under arrest. He merely answered, without any stress on the words:</p>
                     <p>"I swear I am innocent."</p>
                     <p>Van Kieft, much more agitated than his cashier, tried a final attempt.</p>
                     <p>"There is still time," he whispered; "in Heaven's name, my boy——"</p>
                     <p>Prosper appeared not to hear him. He took off his watch-chain a little key,
                        which he laid on the desk.</p>
                     <p>"This is the key, sir, to the steel safe," he said. "I hope, for <emph>my
                           own</emph> sake, that some day you will learn that I never robbed you of
                        aught. I hope, for <emph>your</emph> sake, that you will not learn this too
                        late! Before I go," he added, "let me say that I arranged my books up to the
                        present—in my room. You should know that, not to mention the money missing,
                        there's a little balance against me——"</p>
                     <p>The hearers pricked up their ears.</p>
                     <p>"Money short," thought the first "shadow," "before he went in for a
                        ten-strike, he was knocking the pins over with pony balls, eh?"</p>
                     <p>"Whew!" mused Coon Hall, "the fellow's a loon—he ought to have plugged up
                        the little hole with some of the oakum."</p>
                     <p>"There's a hundred and eighty dollars out," proceeded Prosper quietly. "I
                        took the hundred in advance on my salary—and have lent the eighty odd to
                        some of the clerks—you'll find our I O U's to the several amounts This is
                        the end-day of the month, and to-morrow being quarter pay day, of
                        course——"</p>
                     <p>"Were you authorized, sir," began Newlife, "to take from the cashbox
                        according to your requirements?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh no; but it's very clear that Mr. Van Kieft would not have refused me
                        permission to oblige his clerks. Many cashiers are let do this where
                        salaries are received quarterly only, and I simply did what was done by the
                        man that kept the books before me."</p>
                     <p>"The banker nodded, approvingly.</p>
                     <p>"As for my personal loan," continued the cashier, "I have something like a
                        right, for my savings are invested here, something like three or four
                        thousand dollars."</p>
                     <p>"Quite correct," said Van Kieft, "Mr. Roadside has left all of that in my
                        hands."</p>
                     <p>This last incident satisfactorily gotten over, there was nothing more to be
                        done but quit.</p>
                     <p>Hall had gone for a hack.</p>
                     <p>Slowly, with as much ease as if he was only going out to get his "chop and
                        tart," Prosper, arranged his tossed hair, changed his office coat for his
                        walking one, took his golves and said:</p>
                     <p>"Very well, sir, here I am."</p>
                     <p>Newlife had bowed to Van Kieft.</p>
                     <p>"Hall was at the doorway, come back from telling the coach driver his
                        directions to drive.</p>
                     <p>"Some one will be sitting at the Hall," said he to his principal; "so I've
                        told coachee to go there."</p>
                     <p>"It will be the nearest—all right," answered the other, going out with the
                        cashier.</p>
                     <p>Van Kieft, outside the counter, went to the window, and with deep sorrow and
                        and eyes swimming with tears watched the hack go up the street.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, that I had had double that much stolen," said he, "without having to
                        lose Prosper and esteem him less!"</p>

                        THE TRAP'S HANDS.</head>
                     <p>NOW, Coon Hall, with his always open ears, had heard the banker's epitaph
                        (so to call it); and quick to kindle at suspicion, too ready to think others
                        were almost as cunning as himself, he believed that the speech had been made
                        so that he should hear it.</p>
                     <p>He had lingered behind, looking for a pair of India rubbers (which he had
                        not worn in coming in), and went away with much slowne-s, telling Gabriel
                        Johnson to tetch them to him, if they should turn up. Before he got rid of
                        the darkey, he asked him if there was any but the front entrance to the
                        bank.</p>
                     <p>He ought to have been the man to take Prosper Roadside before the police;
                        but he had conferred with Newlife and obtained full warrant to drive his own
                        cattle, on his own road.</p>
                     <p>The note dashed off by Prosper, put away in Tom's pocket, trotted in the
                        detective's brain. To get hold of it seemed the easiest thing possible. And
                        yet simply to arrest Tom and scare him out of it, might not answer. To
                        merely do that little would only be an incomplete result.</p>
                     <p>Hall was sure that the note was meant, not for the young clerk, but a third
                        person. If roughly handled, Tom was not likely to be in haste to tell the
                        true meaning of the cashier's single word, "Gipsy."</p>
                     <p>If he let out anything, it would be most likely a lie.</p>
                     <p>After mature reflection, the shadow decided, in his police wisdom, that it
                        was better to steal a secret than obtain it by a stand-up fight. To spy Tom,
                        to follow him and catch him in some act which he could not excuse, would be
                        but child's play. Such a mode of acting suited Cooney Hall, gentle and
                        noiseless as he was by nature and by his later training.</p>
                     <p>Beside, Newlife, only recently in the profession compared with him, had
                        already distinguished himself by bold, daring arrests of most terrible
                        scoundrels, heroes of the slung-shot and brass knuckles, who had boasted
                        that "who ever tried to oversize their pile would think the boat had left
                        him!" And as a heutenant, who intended to succeed, if not supplant, his
                        captain, Hall wanted to mask the difference between them by a most
                        contrasting subtlety.</p>
                     <p>Having learnt that there was but one way out from the bank, he departed.
                        But, by a twist or two to his coat, and a denting of his hat, he gave
                        himself a poverty-stricken air, and, with a whining Irish accent to match,
                        "wint an' stud be the poor old man that was barely makin' the pay for his
                        bid, begorra, at the carner beyant," selling chestnuts.</p>
                     <p>Warming his hands at what of the fire the dampness of the hawing air hadn't
                        put out, there he stood, his eyes on the bank stop whenever a person entered
                        or came.</p>
                     <p>He had been there quite an hour, but, patiently munching some chestnuts, and
                        much engrossed in his real task, he showed no symptoms of not being prepared
                        to stand picket many hours more. He was not idle.</p>
                     <p>He pondered over the value of his discoveries, weighed his chances, and,
                        like Alnascuar with his glass, built on this success the castle of his
                        fortune.</p>
                     <p>"The hero of the $100,000 case, sir, yes, sir, Mr. Jacob Hall!"</p>
                     <p>He saw the heading in the evening papers, from which the whole article was
                        copied into the morning journals, as usual.</p>
                     <p>However, at one o'clock (for the aristocratic banker's quill-drivers lunched
                        sixty minutes after workmen), Hall saw Tom come quickly out of the bank.</p>
                     <p>"Here he is!" muttered he: "Good-day, Mickey! If any of the peelers put you
                        off the walk, say (giving card) you're a friend of mine! As for the young
                        cub," continued he, going up Broadway after Tom, "there's something going to
                        happen right in his family."</p>
                     <p>The boy only stepped into a lunch-room to get a quarter of a lemon pie, and,
                        in great haste, reappeared with the crust edge in his hands.
                           <unclear>Bolting</unclear> it with that scorn of chewing which young
                        people's teeth evince, he plunged into the <unclear>slush</unclear> over the
                        Russ, and, with the agility town-reared lads only possess, climbed up on the
                        driver's seat of an Amity street stage.</p>
                     <p>There was a truck, unloaded, next behind the stage.</p>
                     <p>There were many omnibusses behind it and before, but none of the Amity
                        street line. Hall growled, so to say, for his own benefit. He was walking
                        fast, never minding the exclamations drawn from passers-by whom he ran
                        against.</p>
                     <p>The man with the glazed cap, who haunted Tammany steps in those days, was
                        slowly coming down the walk, with a stack of his patent unserviceable
                        umbrellas. Quick as light Jacob pulled another of his useful cards out of
                        his pocket, together with a Corporation check, ready for the auditor, and
                        saying: "Get that filled up, Murphy!" grabbed an umbrella, and leaving the
                        curbstone, jumped up on the tail of the cart.</p>
                     <p>The carman naturally was startled to be so unceremoniously invaded by a
                        somewhat shabby little man with a gigantic blue umbrella; but running up to
                        his side, and seizing with his right hand the double rung in front. Hall
                        explained himself. He took the truck by the hour.</p>
                     <p>"But what for?"</p>
                     <p>"To carry me."</p>
                     <p>"I carry things, not folks," said the truckman.</p>
                     <p>"Well, my umbrella is a thing, ain't it, No. 3,973. William E. Smith, 262
                        Eighth avenue, in the rear!"</p>
                     <p>"Eh? Why that's me!"</p>
                     <p>"'Course it is."</p>
                     <p>The detective had more than once studied the licensed carman's register.</p>
                     <p>So, on this shaking vehicle, but admirable for a man who liked to be free to
                        jump off to the ground when and where he pleased; Coon Hall proceeded up
                        town.</p>
                     <p>Several times, peeping around his umbrella, which effectually hid his
                        figure, he remarked how Tom Cragin uneasily looked about him.</p>
                     <p>He thought it was from distrust, but, really, the boy had only an hour
                        before him, and the blocks at Duabe, at Canal and at Grand streets, made the
                        stage lose time.</p>
                     <p>In the end, the Amity street turn was taken, and, the truck following faster
                        as the stage rattled off on being free of the "ruck," Hall presently saw the
                        boy tapping the driver on the arm to pull up. Before the wheels had fairly
                        ceased to revolve, Tom swung himself down and jumped off.</p>
                     <p>The truck went into the curb-stone. Hall paid the driver, and easily
                        alighted on the sidewalk.</p>
                     <p>The stage went on, the truck executed a turn and went up to Broadway
                        again.</p>
                     <p>Tommy Cragin, quite unaware of his being so closely dogged, turned to his
                        left into Rochambeau place, one of the semi-stylish streets leading off from
                        Bleecker, very quiet and very respectable.</p>
                     <p>Before the English-basement house, one of a row with a gold leaf 39 on the
                        plate glass above the door, the boy stopped. As if used to it, he ran his
                        hand through the pickets of the non-railing gate, opened the spring-catch,
                        and was about to walk in, when, feeling a tap on the shoulder, he turned
                        abruptly and found himself face to face with Jacob Hall and the blue
                        umbrella.</p>
                     <p>He recognized the former easily enough—and perhaps the latter had not
                        escaped his notice—and so clearly, that he turned very pale and entered the
                        small garden before the house in retreating.</p>
                     <p>Hall not only followed him, but accelerating his recession, bore him back,
                        if you understand, so that he fairly walked him into the sort of cave under
                        the stoop which English-basement buildings rejoice in.</p>
                     <p>"Now then! what are you up to?" snarled Tommy.</p>
                     <p>What distinguished Mr. Cooney Hall was his exquisite kindness and unequaled
                        urbanity. Even when he had knucks and penny-ante players to "cop," as
                        sometimes happened when business was slack, he collared them with the utmost
                        politeness, and twisted his mid-finger knuckle into their spinal joints with
                        a sort of gracefulness which, unhappily, did not take out the sting in that
                        police process.</p>
                     <p>"My boy," said he, like a father, "I have some information to obtain from
                        Master Thomas Cragin——"</p>
                     <p>"'Taint me—my name's Tom—I was christened so—Tom, short," returned the lad,
                        beginning to recover his voice, now that the ghostliness of the detective's
                        sudden appearance had worn off.</p>
                     <p>Rochambeau place is not one wherein vehicles make the foot-passenger run any
                        danger. Except between 10 and 11½ in the morning and 3 and 6 in the evening,
                        when the male residents go to and return from their vocations, it is only
                        explored by the children and nurses going to Washington Parade Ground, and
                        by an occasional tinker or soap-fat man, who, beginning to cry out boldly,
                        "to mind—to mind—to mind," or "so'-fat—ha' yer got any so'-fat," speed ly
                        subsides into the decayed gentlewoman's "muffins" whisper, so weighty is the
                        flavor of respectability in the district.</p>
                     <p>All the blinds of the house were closed, although this was on the shady
                        side, for, indeed, the people make it their rule to live in the back of the
                        dwellings, and only show their parlors on days of party-giving.</p>
                     <p>So, unless their presence should become known to some servant, the man and
                        the boy were in privacy in their nook.</p>
                     <p>"My good lad," began the detective in his mildest voice, "you remember me,
                        and know how things stand. I'm an officer, and you may get yourself into
                        trouble if you don't look out. What are you doing here?"</p>
                     <p>"Come home to see—my mother!" returned Tom.</p>
                     <p>"You little dev——I mean you're an artful card! The name's Raymond on the
                        doorplate."</p>
                     <p>The officer had noticed that, luckily.</p>
                     <p>"This morning, within two hours or three ago, Mr. Prosper Roadsid every
                        'cutely gave you a note—a little note——"</p>
                     <p>Cragin had guessed that the note was at the bottom of his persecution, and
                        he tried to put himself on his guard.</p>
                     <p>"No such thing," said he, stoutly; but he blushed to the tips of his ears.
                        He had a fine, thin skin, and would have been fair, but that a fondness for
                        outdoor sports gave him a sunburnt hue.</p>
                     <p>"Fum, fum, fum! it won't do! I saw him throw it to you!"</p>
                     <p>"He hit me with a spit-ball," began Tom again.</p>
                     <p>"Then, what for——"</p>
                     <p>"For me to look up at him, so he could——"</p>
                     <p>The mischief—the excuse was going to harm him more than the truth
                        itself.</p>
                     <p>"I'll be late back to the office; please don't keep me!"</p>
                     <p>"Well, if you <emph>will</emph> be unreasonable, let us go back," said Jacob
                        softly; "for I shall need to ask three or four of the clerks at the bank if
                        they didn't see Mr. Roadside with a note and pass it to you?"</p>
                     <p>The boy saw that to persist in blind obstinacy with such a man was rank
                        folly, so he "changed his base."</p>
                     <p>"Well," he answered in a boyish, insolent tone, "I did get the paper; it was
                        something that's my business; and if you wasna-watching me all this time,
                        you must have seen me tear it up. There!"</p>
                     <p>This might have been a fact. Hall was much afraid so, really. But he had
                        caught the boy in so many falsehoods that he plunged forward at all
                        hazards.</p>
                     <p>"Well sung; but it's the same old tune, my boy; the note was given you to be
                        taken to the Gipsy."</p>
                     <p>To the detective's surprise, Tom could not help laughing in his face. The
                           <emph>the</emph> that he had prefixed to Gipsy, at once told the boy that
                        the shadow was not much in the secret.</p>
                     <p>"I'll take my oath," said he, breathing more freely, "that——"</p>
                     <p>"No use," said Hall, cutting him short, beginning to be vexed at a boy
                        giving him so much ado; "all the oaths ever sworn in a district court
                        wouldn't do. You have not only got that note, but you have come to this
                        house to give it to the person, whether he's a gipsy or not. You've got it
                        in your pocket."</p>
                     <p>"I say I haven't anything for a gipsy!" returned Tom.</p>
                     <p>Hall did not trouble his head about the vehemence of his denial, but pursued
                        in his honeyed voice;</p>
                     <p>"And so you will hand it over to me."</p>
                     <p>"No, I'll not!" and, bowing his head, he executed a "dodge" which, with
                        almost anybody but Coon, would have taken him through the detective's figers
                        like a fly.</p>
                     <p>But the shadow had been expecting this, for his hands seized the boy's arms,
                        and with his superior strength he easily held him.</p>
                     <p>"You'll get hurt next, my lad," said he, still gently, "and you'd better
                        take old <emph>Dr. Jacob's</emph> advice, and fork over the paper."</p>
                     <p>"Haven't it. I tell you!"</p>
                     <p>"Very well. Let me see. Wooster street Station House is the nearest, I
                        fancy. I can have you searched properly there, not to speak of your night's
                        lodging there, or in White Street Detention as a witness rather
                        slippery."</p>
                     <p>"Now the boy <emph>was</emph> devoted to Prosper, with that feeling which
                        youth has for a "big boy," that strong friendship, which grows stronger at a
                        greater age, only by fading into love for 'he sweeter sex. But it was very
                        clearly proven that he was caught.</p>
                     <p>To give up the paper under such circumstances was not betrayal. He was ready
                        to cry with vexation, as he said:</p>
                     <p>"Then take it!"</p>
                     <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC8328-00000008"/>
                     <p>He pulled out his little memorandum-book, and pulled from between the leaves
                        the crumpled note.</p>
                     <p>Coon's hands trembled as they unfolded it, and he read as follows:</p>
                     <q>

                                 <p>"MY DARLING: As you love me, obey me at once—quick. Take all you
                                    have in the house—<emph>all</emph>—and go to some boarding-house
                                    up town, east side. Keep as quiet as you can. On this my life
                                    may depend. I am arrested for a large theft. You have money.
                                    Send your new address to young Cragin. He'll explain the rest.

                     <p>You could mark on the reader's face every token of an immense
                        disappointment. Hall had hugged to himself the hope of laying hands on a
                        most important document, perhaps of an undeniable evidence of Prosper's
                        innocence or guilt. Instead, here was a lover's note, much less concerning
                        the writer than the woman beloved.</p>
                     <p>There was only waste labor in trying to wrench the lines into some bidden
                        meaning. They spoke neither for nor against the prisoner. The word "all" was
                        italicised, but then that could be interpreted in ever so many ways.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheless, the detective resolved to keep on as he had come.</p>
                     <p>"So," said he to Cragin, the gipsy's a woman, a lady-friend of Mr.
                        Roadside's?"</p>
                     <p>"She aint a gipsy, it's only a bye-word," said he, with that boyish desire
                        to exhibit inner knowledge so natural to them.</p>
                     <p>"And she lives here—with Mrs. Raymond?"</p>
                     <p>"She is Miss Raymond—she's the mistress of the house."</p>
                     <p>"Oh, I see! Thank you. And now, my good boy, as you will have hardly time to
                        return to the bark before half-past two—Mr. Van Kieft will no doubt excuse
                        you the half extra—you had better go. I will save you the rest of the
                        trouble by delivering to Miss Raymond the note, myself!"</p>
                     <p>Tom pouted.</p>
                     <p>"And, if you know what's good for you being pretty smart, you'll go to your
                        desk and not meddle any more in this ugly matter. There'll be Sing Sing for
                        somebody, I fear, before it is all over."</p>
                     <p>"But—oh, oh, sir—Mr. Roadside has been so good to me. I used to go to the
                        same school with him; he got me my situation, and I keep my mother with
                        it."</p>
                     <p>"The very reason you should remain quiet. You're a bright, smart boy, I say
                        again, but you cannot do anything to help Mr. Roadside."</p>
                     <p>He didn't do it, I'm sure!"</p>
                     <p>So thought Cooney Hall, but he was not going to unlock his opinion. He would
                        have liked to have induced the lad to put a seal on what had passed between
                        them, but that he dared not do.</p>
                     <p>"Maybe," observed he; "If so, it will be a good thing for your friend. I
                        hope it the more because of your intimacy with him—that may get you
                        suspected of having a hand in. If it wasn't that I could lay my hand on you
                        at any time. I wouldn't let you go away so freely now; so my duty
                        directs!"</p>
                     <p>The lad was quite crushed.</p>
                     <p>"Go to your desk, then. Good bye—all comes right if we only wait long
                        enough!"</p>
                     <p>The boy slowly west out upon the street, and on reaching the first corner on
                        the way to catch a Bleecker-street stage, he saw that Hall had gone up the
                        steps and was pulling the front door-bell boldly. A bell near the University
                        struck half-past two. He took to his heels, and luckily finding a stage,
                        spent the whole time riding down town in seeking how to serve Prosper, to
                        warn Miss Raymond, and to be quits with the oily detective who had so
                        shamefully "beaten" him.</p>
                     <p>As Hall rang a second time, the door opened. A neatly-dressed servant girl,
                        not very good-looking, appeared.</p>
                     <p>"Miss Raymond," said Jacob.</p>
                     <p>The girl hesitated; which seeing, he showed her the note.</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Prosper Roadside gave me this for your mistress, and I'm to wait for an
                        answer—no, no, I'm to hand it to her myself."</p>
                     <p>"I'm afraid she's asleep in the back parlor, but, if you will walk in and
                        take a seat, I will see."</p>
                     <p>Hall closed his umbrella tightly, it having fallen down and broken bounds
                        during the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">quasi</foreign> struggle with Tom Cragin,
                        and walked indoors.</p>
                     <p>A handsome hat-stand stood in the passage, but Jacob did not foreknow enough
                        of the limits of his stay to intrust his hat to its turned pegs or his
                        umbrella to its rack.</p>
                     <p>Roadside's name had produced the effect it ought to have had, seeing that
                        the establishment was kept up by his cash. Therefore, Hall was introduced
                        into the front parlor.</p>
                     <p>The girl pulled one of the shades inside the heavy curtain and left the
                        room.</p>
                     <p>Jacob rose from his seat, laid his hat and umbrella on the waterproof cover
                        of the large piano, and looked around.</p>
                     <p>The room was richly carpeted, and the furniture was heavy and stylish, as
                        seen spite of the unbleached linen coverings. The few pictures on the walls
                        were good ones, in oil and chromolithograph. A statuette or two and plenty
                        of bronze, gilt and jeweled knicknacks strewed the mantelpiece, the tables
                        and etageres in the corners. The windows had outside blinds, shades, wooden
                        shutters within, and then the heavy curtains spoken of.</p>
                     <p>Though Winter, the closeness of the apartment rendered it comfortable
                        enough. The fire was laid in the grate, with a brass scuttle of Breckinridge
                        coal close by, but one seemed not to have been lit for several days.</p>
                     <p>"By jingo!" muttered Hall, "this merry young cashier has been swinging out
                        to the full length of his club so have such a nest, I'll bet. Wonder if the
                        bird 's to match?"</p>
                     <p>As he thought this, one of the folding-doors was rolled back, and Miss
                        Raymond came in.</p>
                     <p>"Gipsy" was a girl of about eighteen, frail, slender, nicely shaped, of a
                        warm yet fair hue, with child-like hands and feet. Long, bent, silky lashes
                        subdued the otherwise too bright sparkle of her eyes, which were black; her
                        lips, rather thick, smiled over pearly, lustrous teeth, sharp enough to eat
                        all the dainties that half-a-dozen young men's fortunes might buy.</p>
                     <p>She had, truly, been dozing, if not asleep, for she was wrapped up in a
                        long, flowered velvet dressing-gown, that one could see was too large for
                        her, and was, indeed, Prosper's. But she must have reposed in a chair, not
                        on a pillow, for her hair was tastefully wound up in designedly rough
                        braids, its dark brown masses rounding out from under bands of bright red
                        velvet, and forming a small ball behind.</p>
                     <p>She was so saucily beautiful that Jacob, who had seen many fine creatures in
                        his "travels in search of the pocket-picturesque," was dazzled, and trembled
                        like a ship taken all aback.</p>
                     <p>"Hang me!" he said to himself, recalling Viandra's rich and noble loveliness
                        of a few hours before, "our cashier boy has good taste—very good
                        taste—altogether too good."</p>
                     <p>While he was thus thinking, puzzled how to open the conversation, Gipsy eyed
                        him in the most contemptuous manner, stupefied at beholding in her best room
                        so common a man, with such a shocking bad hat and Paul Pry umbrella.</p>
                     <p>As she had, during her brief career, run into debt two or three times,
                        without getting out of it by payment, she began to wonder who had the
                        impudence to send such a dun to wipe his boots on her costly carpet.</p>
                     <p>"What do you want?" inquired she, at last, opening her eyes three-quarters
                        in the most impertinent way.</p>
                     <p>Anybody but Hall would have kicked at the goad of her tone and look; he paid
                        no attention to them, save to draw thence some notion of the speaker's
                        character.</p>
                     <p>"A bad egg," considered he, "and no broughtens up!"</p>
                     <p>Being so slow to answer, Gypsy stamped her foot in impatience.</p>
                     <p>"Don't you hear? What's brought you here?" she said.</p>
                     <p>"My dear young lady," responded the detective in his softest and most humble
                        voice, "I am charged to give you a little note from Mr. Roadside."</p>
                     <p>"From Prosper? So you know him, do you?"</p>
                     <p>"I have that pleasure, and, I may make use of the express on, style myself
                        one of his friends!"</p>
                     <p>"Friend!" sneered Gypsy.</p>
                     <p>Jacob took no notice of the sneer. He was playing his points, and, during
                        the game, scorn fell off from him like bullets from against an
                        iron-clad.</p>
                     <p>"I say I'm a friend of his," he proceeded, "and I'm sure very few people now
                        will have the courage to loudly acknowledge their friendship with him."</p>
                     <p>So seriously did the man speak, that Gypsy began to feel impressed.</p>
                     <p>"I ain't good at puzzles," said she shortly; "what are you driving at?"</p>
                     <p>Coon slowly pulled out of his pocket the note taken from Cragin, and said,
                        as he presented it. "Read it."</p>
                     <p>So far, the girl had no foreboding.</p>
                     <p>Though her eyes were as bright as well could be, she adjusted a gold
                        eye-glass on her nose before she untolded the billet. With one glance she
                        read it quite through. First she turned pale, then very red. A nervous spasm
                        shook her from head to foot; she staggered. Hall fancied she was going to
                        drop, and sprang forward to support her. A useless care; for Gypsy was one
                        of those women whose indolence masks a devil's own energy—fragile creatures,
                        whose resistant powers have no limit—cats for gracefulness and delicacy, but
                        especially for their steel muzzles and tirelessness.</p>
                     <p>Her giddiness was brief. She reeled, but was not going to fall or faint. She
                        straightened herself, caught hold of the detective's arm, and, though with
                        her small hand, so tightly, that the grip almost made him cry out.</p>
                     <p>"What does this mean?" she exclaimed. "You're not little Tom! Do you know
                        what this is all about?"</p>
                     <p>Fearless as he was, used to meet most dangerous jail-birds, Jacob was rather
                        afraid than not at Miss Raymond in anger.</p>
                     <p>"Prosper arrested for theft——"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, folks say he took nearly a hundred thousand dollars out of Mr. Van
                        Kieft's safe."</p>
                     <p>"A lie!" cried the girl. "They're crazy who say so."</p>
                     <p>She had released the detective, and her fury, downright outbreak of a spoilt
                        child, foamed forth in extravagant gestures. She walked up and down the
                        room, and kicked over a trifle table rather than go an inch out of her way
                        to pass around it. Her dressing gown flying open, she began to claw at the
                        lace about her neck.</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Roadside steal!" she kept repeating as she moved to and fro; "what
                        stuff! What does he want to steal for? Hasn't he a pile of his own?"</p>
                     <p>"Why," put in Hall, by the door, as if prepared to run if the girl flew in
                        his direction, "Mr. Roadside isn't rich; he has only his salary to live
                        on."</p>
                     <p>This reply appeared to quite upset Gypsy's calculations.</p>
                     <p>"But, but," persisted she, "he's always had plenty of money! Not rich, eh?
                        Why, then, he—he——"</p>
                     <p>Her eyes meeting Coon's, she stopped. They understood one another.</p>
                     <p>Gypsy's glance meant—"he stole to decorate my house and me?"</p>
                     <p>"May be," was implied by the detective's look.</p>
                     <p>But ten seconds' reflection sufficed to restore the girl to her first
                        belief. The doubt which had chilled her mind melted away.</p>
                     <p>"Oh no! never! Prosper would never have touched a red for <emph>me!</emph> A
                        fellow might empty safes and cash-boxes to satisfy a girl he's wild about,
                        as often happens, I know; but Roadside don't love me, and never did——"</p>
                     <p>"Oh, my dear young lady!" interposed the gallant Hall, whose politeness was
                        built on the "Praise girls, you can't come <unclear>at</unclear> too strong"
                           (<foreign xml:lang="DEU">Jungfrauen foll man loben, es sei war oder
                           erlogen</foreign>) principle, "you can't believe what you say."</p>
                     <p>She shook her head sadly; something like tears bedewed her eyelids.</p>
                     <p>"I know best," she murmured. "He'll do 'most anything for me, sure enough;
                        but what does that prove? When I say he don't love me, I know it but too
                        well. Once I was loved by a man—worth five of Roadside—and by what I
                        suffered the year after I left him I understand how unhappy I must have made
                        him. I'm nothing to Roadside better than the girls of the Crosby-street
                        supper-rooms."</p>
                     <p>"But, then, why——"</p>
                     <p>"Why," interrupted Gypsy, laying her hand on the piano and striking the
                        case, "why all this? You'll be very smart if <emph>you</emph> can tell me.
                        For a dozen months now I've been trying to find out why he's so good to me,
                        and <emph>I</emph> am a woman! How the deuce (she took a chair, and spoke
                        more as if to herself)—how the deuce can you lay hold of a man's secret when
                        he's such a master of himself that nothing of his heart appears in his eyes?
                        I've studied him as a girl must those on whom her existence hangs—all time
                        lost! He is kind, gentlemanly, but he offers no hold for a grasp. He looks
                        weak, eh? I guess he may be, but he's not an anvil to bear—he's more of a
                        hammer to strike. He's a bar of steel painted and gilt; but its steel
                        underneath, if the viper try to gnaw such a knowing file!"</p>
                     <p>Swept onward by the violence of her feelings, Miss Raymond let the very
                        depths of her spirit arise unveiled. She was without distrust, never
                        doubting the man, who, though a stranger, listened as Prosper's friend.</p>
                     <p>Hall was inwardly applauding his luck and skill. It takes a woman to paint a
                        likeness—they beat even the photograph for resemblances. In one moment she
                        had given him the most precious information. He knew henceforth with what
                        manner of man he had to deal, which is a cardinal point in detection.</p>
                     <p>"But," observed he: "Mr. Roadside's said to be a fast crab at cards and the
                        bones."</p>
                     <p>"Pooh! It's true enough that he gambles. I've seen him win or lose a heap
                        without winking. But he's no gambler. He stakes on a card the same way as he
                        handles the ribbons, or calls for another basket of champagne, with no
                        flurry, no pleasure. Sometimes he frightens me—life seems to be out of him.
                        Oh, sir, you look old enough to have a family! Don't you ever let your girls
                        like to go gay on a holiday! It's so easy to become like me—I ought to be
                        happy—but I am far from that! He has always shown me such indifference that
                        I'd quarrel with him, break with him, if I didn't think it came from some
                        despair of his. Such a cool hand steal? Not so that it could be
                           <emph>easily</emph> found out, you bet!"</p>
                     <p>Hall was leaning on the piano, Gypsy was rocking herself in the chair.</p>
                     <p>"But, of course, you know his whole life——"</p>
                     <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC8328-00000009"/>
                     <p>"Of course I don't! It's a wonder I know his real name! Didn't you hear me?
                        I told you he don't care a bit for me!"</p>
                     <p>The rain had followed the whirlwind. Gypsy was weeping; large, large tears
                        were coursing silently down her cheeks. It was but a moment of despair.
                        Presently she started to her feet, her eyes aglow with the most generous
                        resolutions.</p>
                     <p>"But <emph>I</emph> love <emph>him!</emph>" she cried, "and I will save him.
                        I know how to talk to his big-bug banker woo lays the blame on him, and to
                        the judge, and to everybody. He's in custody, is he?"</p>
                     <p>"I believe so," said Hall, cautiously, as if he had heard once or twice, of
                        prisoners mysteriously vanishing while in officers' charge.</p>
                     <p>"I'll show up that he is innocent. Come, sir, let's go! I promise you that
                        he'll be free before the day's out, or I'll be looked up with him!"</p>
                     <p>Her impulse was undoubtedly praiseworthy, but it went against the
                        detective's plan.</p>
                     <p>Determined though he was to keep back the troubles as well as benefits of
                        his side-game, Hall well knew that he could not conceal Miss Raymond
                        forever. But, as she would be surely unearthed in the end, he deemed it best
                        to produce her himself at the nick most convenient in his eyes.</p>
                     <p>So he first began to try to soothe the girl. He fancied that it would be
                        easy for him to prove to her that her least step in favor of Roadside would
                        be signal folly.</p>
                     <p>"My dear young lady," he said, "by delivering yourself up, what will you
                        gain? Perhaps they'll rake up half a hundred other reasons than your
                        expenses that prompted the cashier to embezzle. You mayn't be believed,
                        either—you may be taken for an accomplice."</p>
                     <p>But such disquieting perspectives as alarmed Tom Cragin, and had made him
                        surrender the note which he might have defended, only stimulated the girl's
                        enthusiasm. Man reasons, but a woman is driven by the impulses of her heart.
                        Where the most devoted friend halts, wavers and shrinks back, the loving
                        woman will march forward with lowered head, ceaseless of what's to come.</p>
                     <p>"What's the danger!" said she. "I don't believe there's any at all. I'm sure
                        Prosper is innocent, but—if he possibly could be guilty—I'm willing to share
                        his punishment. Wait a minute!"</p>
                     <p>She rushed through into the back parlor.</p>
                     <p>Hall was too much astonished to stop her.</p>
                     <p>"Now, of all the mad creatures!" mused he. "What can she be after now?"</p>
                     <p>She returned, as he thus marveled, having hastily changed the dressing-gown
                        for a shawl, and put on a hat, declaring herself ready to go and talk to all
                        the police captains in every precinct.</p>
                     <p>Happily, Coon had several strings to his bow.</p>
                     <p>"If you like, I'll go anywhere with you. My time is my own,' he remarked,
                        "different from little Oragin, who had to be at his office. But very likely
                        you do Mr. Roadside more harm than good."</p>
                     <p>"Pshaw!" answered she, "some people must be saved in spite of themselves. I
                        know Prosper is a man to let himself go under without snatching at an oar,
                        let alone a straw—out of sheer hopelessness."</p>
                     <p>"I don't know about that, ma'am," interrupted Jacob. "Mr. Roadside is not
                        that kind, though you say it. If he had time to write that note, he had time
                        to draw up a plan. If you show yourself, metead of hiding, as he says,
                        perhaps you'll upset all his game."</p>
                     <p>"But I can't stand here, doing nothing to help him," said she sharpl,
                        fldgeting under her shawl. "The carpet burns my feet——"</p>
                     <p>"You've a very easy way of helping the man you love, my dear young lady,
                        said Jacob; "obey him, my child," he added paternally.</p>
                     <p>Gypsy expected quite some other move.</p>
                     <p>"Obey him, obey," she muttered.</p>
                     <p>"There lies your duty," observed Jacob in a voice so grave and so solemn and
                        so unlike himself, that he might have been taken for a Newman Hall indeed:
                        "it is your sacred duty!"</p>
                     <p>The girl looked up and looked down, and tapped with her foot restlessly.</p>
                     <p>Coon stopped and picked up the note which had fallen near her feet.</p>
                     <p>"Look here," he said; "Mr. Roadside, on the eve of arrest, writes to give
                        you your cue, and yet you want to miss your entrance. Let's read this
                        together—it's the very key to his liberty. He says: 'As you love me obey me
                        at once!' And you linger in your obedience. He says, moreover: 'On this, my
                        life may depend!' Don't you love him! My poor child, if Mr. Roadside bids
                        you keep close, it's because he has weighty reasons."</p>
                     <p>Mr. Jacob Hall was well aware of these reasons since he had seen the beauty
                        of Rochambeau p'ace, and, if he had not yet unmasked them, that came from
                        the same reason that a good general keeps a reserve in hand to launch forth
                        to decide a victory.</p>
                     <p>Gypsy was intelligent enough to understand.</p>
                     <p>"So Prosper wants to keep our connection secret," she commenced. "Yes,"
                        resumed she after a moment's thought, "I see into it now, I was mad not not
                        to have seen it before. I've been here all of a year, and he's paid all my
                        buls—what a charge against him. Some sneaking lawyer will make a list of my
                        scent-bottles and glove-boxes, and count the shells of the oysters we've had
                        together! My purchases of photographs and books and chocolate-drops will be
                        twisted into a crime of his!"</p>
                     <p>Hall nodded.</p>
                     <p>"To be sure I must go! Perhaps the police are on my track! Perhaps coming
                        here this minute!"</p>
                     <p>"You needn't start your Niagara again," said Coon, as smoothly as if he had
                        a lump of Goshen butter on his tongue; "you have time and to spare—the
                        police ain't half as sharp as the papers try to make out, or one would have
                        been here before now."</p>
                     <p>"Nevermind!"</p>
                     <p>Leaving Jacob to occupy the rocking-chair and arrange his next step, Gypsy
                        rushed into the back parlor again, set her bell a-ringing, assembled her
                        servants, her cook and a boy, and ordering them to pull all the drawers out
                        of the bureau and turn them upside down, helped them to pack the contents
                        higgledy-piggledy in a couple of Saratogas and two or three carpet bags. In
                        a reticule she crammed her jewel cases.</p>
                     <p>A sudden thought brought her back to the detective.</p>
                     <p>"I'll have all ready in a minute," said she. "Where are we going?"</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Roadside says to some boarding-house on the east side, up town, don't
                        he?"</p>
                     <p>"I believe so; but—but, I've lived quiet all this year—the only houses I
                        know up that way are——Mr. Roadside would not like me to go to them."</p>
                     <p>Hall pretended to ruminate, but really he had coun less pains to conceal a
                        peculiar delight which sparkled in his small eyes, spite of himself.</p>
                     <p>"I know a good hotel," said he, "but I don't know that it would suit you. It
                        don't begin to look up to this level——"</p>
                     <p>"If it's in the city, anything can be bought, I suppose."</p>
                     <p>"With my introduction, you'll think you were were in the White House, and
                        it's so quiet, too."</p>
                     <p>"Nineteenth street, just off Third avenue. Mrs. Margetson's Old Pear Tree
                        House. Here's my name, 'Philip Abraham,' on one of her cards—say I gave it
                        to you, and you'll be all right."</p>
                     <p>"Very well" said Miss Raymond, taking the card: "now, how am I to give Tom
                        Cragin my address?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh, I'll see him to once't, never you fear," answered Jacob, "and 'll tell
                        him about you. And, now, got everything packed paced up? That's the style.
                        I'll run out for a hack."</p>
                     <p>He wanted to be by himself, and it was a good excuse.</p>
                     <p>He was in luck, for a rusty old coach was passing the end of the street. He
                        ran after if, and stopped it.</p>
                     <p>"Driver, here's a quarter, extra," said he. "at No. 39, a lady wants you. It
                        she says, drive to Nineteenth street and Third avenue, just crack your whip.
                        I want to know for certain, and I'll lay low. If she says anywhere else, get
                        you down, as if to hook in the traces a link tighter. I'll be on deck then.
                        I've took your number, mind!"</p>
                     <p>With that he installed himself in an alley a few doors off. Presently the
                        jarvey cracked his whip like a paving-stone exploding in an election
                        bontire, and off rolled Miss Raymond to the Old Pear Tree House.</p>
                     <p>"Bully boy, Jake," chuckled Hall to himself, rubbing his hands. "I'm a
                        reg'lar Georgia Major; angels couldn't whip me! I've got her to rights just
                        where I want her!"</p>
                     <p>But there's no knowing who is President until the election is over.</p>

                     <head type="sub">LOCKED UP IN LUDLOW SEREET JAIL—THE EXAMINATION—THE
                        COMMITTAL—REMANDED.</head>
                     <p>AS MISS Raymond was hurrying for refuge to the Old Pear Tree House, Prosper
                        Roadside was taken on to Ludlow street jail.</p>
                     <p>Since the point when, master of himself, he had succeeded in drawing his
                        usual coolness about him, not an edge of the mantle had fallen away. In vain
                        did the two officers, who had replaced Newlife, seek to discover a weakening
                        of his look, a relaxing of his facial muscles; he might as well have been of
                        marble. Many would have fancied that he was insensible to his alarming
                        position, had it not been for his hurried respiration revealing painful
                        oppression, and the drops from temple to temple in a line betraying keen
                        anxiety. While in the Justice's chamber, during about half an hour, he had
                        chatted with the two officers in charge of him, and shared the cigars in his
                        case with them, on their disinterestedly remarking that "the new man at
                        Ludlow street was death on smokers."</p>
                     <p>One of the officers thought to himself, while his fellow officials were
                        moving about, eyeing the prisoner in their usual half mocking way:</p>
                     <p>"He's a hard case."</p>
                     <p>The other observed to a friend: "He's too cool not to want close keep, you
                        bet."</p>
                     <p>As he had not dined, and there was no time to delay for that, he bought a
                        couple of apples of "granny," at the outer doorstep of the basement. She
                        understood that he was arrested, for she said, by way of thanks for his not
                        taking change out of the dime:</p>
                     <p>"Bedad, I wish yer good luck, sir!"</p>
                     <p>Prosper smiled, and said he: "Thank you, mother, but I've been long out of
                        that article."</p>
                     <p>It had cleared off, and, as far as overhead was concerned, was as fine a day
                        now as Winter permits above Mason and Dixon's line. While going along
                        Chatham street, and into Division, Prosper put his head out of the window,
                        upon the sunny side, several times, and, smiling to think of being in
                        custody while so many people were freely crowding the walks, he
                        muttered:</p>
                     <p>"It's singular! I never before felt so like going off for a day's
                        spree."</p>
                     <p>One of the officers greeted the idea with a burst of laughter.</p>
                     <p>"That's natural encugb," said he. "I remember Huntingdon saying the same
                        thing, with the difference that he'd like to have had a good horse before
                        the dashboard, in front of him."</p>
                     <p>At the jail, Roadside looked on idly as his conductor's went through the
                        formality of delivering him over.</p>
                     <p>But when, after he had turned his pockets out on the table, the searcher
                        opened the private room door to take him in there with him, indignation
                        flashed from his eyes, and a scalding tear fell, to be instantly dried by
                        the flame on his cheek. But he submitted. Then he was taken away to his
                        room, rather than cell, for only the bars to the window, and its plainness
                        of furniture, showed it to be in a prison.</p>
                     <p>When the door closed behind him, and he heard the bolt shut and the lock
                        snap, he breathed again. He was alone.</p>
                     <p>He thought so!</p>
                     <p>He did not know how many cells are mere glass boxes, within which the
                        captive plays the part of the beetle under the entomologists microscope. The
                        walls indeed have ears, the doors are eyed like a peacock's tail.</p>
                     <p>But he was so sure that he was alone that all his <unclear>pride</unclear>
                        melted in a torrent of tears. His impassibility faded like a wax-mark. His
                        long-restrained anger burst forth violently and fearfully, like a smothered
                        fire breaking out to its utmost night.</p>
                     <p>He vented innumerable curses and imprecacations. He smashed a chair on the
                        head of the iron bedstead. He set his hands a bleeding in such a fit of mad
                        and impotent wrath as a wild beast yields to when first caged.</p>
                     <p>For Prosper Roadside, to use the melo-dramatic phrase, "was not what he
                        seemed."</p>
                     <p>The naughty and correct young man, a sort of iced old head on young
                        shoulders, had ardent passions and a fiery temper.</p>
                     <p>But one day, about his twenty-fourth year, ambition had stung his heart. His
                        many desires, choking for want of food, set him to considering the many
                        wealthy men whose money was as Aladdin's lamp. He envied, and he ferreted
                        out the origin and starting depot of the leading financial trains; and he
                        found that these men had for the most part less to begin with than he. How
                        then had they raised themselves? By dint of energy, of boldness, and
                        intelligence. He vowed to do likewise, and stop only at the same jumping-off
                        place as they.</p>
                     <p>Thenceforward, with a force of will much less rare than most think, he bound
                        down his impulses to silence. He reformed, not his character but the
                        external aspect of it. His efforts were not lost. Many of the old school,
                        watching him at the Stock Board through gold spectacles, would say: "That's
                        Van Kieft's young cashier, ain't it? Oh! he'll be a-top of the ladder if he
                        only keeps on; there's so few young men who steer clear of the concert halls
                        these times!"</p>
                     <p>And now, here was Prosper in prison, accused of theft. In one
                        word—ruined.</p>
                     <p>He was not blind to the state of things. He knew that, guiltless or guilty,
                        a suspected man is branded with as ineffaceable a mark as though the king's
                        stamp was on his shoulder, as in the good old colony days.</p>
                     <p>What a fool he'd been to work so hard! What a bigger one he'd be if he
                        should try to wipe out the stain!</p>
                     <p>When the turnkey, an hour afterward,<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC8328-00000010"
                        /> brought him in dinner from Wade's eating house, he found Roadside on the
                        bed, with his head buried in the pillow, weeping like a maid sent to her
                        room supperless, on discovery of her first love-letter.</p>
                     <p>Hunger was an unknown sensation now to him. An unconquerable stupor had the
                        better of him, and his will, like an unmanned ship cast loose, drifted on
                        and on, this way and that, in the thick of a fog.</p>
                     <p>Night came, lasting so long that he began to marvel how the human frame
                        could bear so much acute suffering. Toward dawn, however, sleep came to him
                        and he was in slumber when the locker-up looked in.</p>
                     <p>"Time to dress, sir. You're to go before Justice Kogan at the Tom s."</p>
                     <p>Prosper leaped to his feet. It was something to be examined.</p>
                     <p>"Dress be hanged," said he, "I'm ready now."</p>
                     <p>"He's a tough young card," thought the turnkey. "Paddy was right when he
                        told me so. Don't get fevery about it, sir," said he aloud, "Mr. Kogan's
                        generally in good humor, and it's too big a sum in question for him to try
                        you."</p>
                     <p>The man was right.</p>
                     <p>Endowed with remarkable insight; firm, incapable of partiality to even
                        aldermen's friends; equally alien to mock pity and excessive sternness.
                        Justice Kogan was truly one of those magistrates who can be pitted, without
                        fear of the result, against the paid life-magistrate of Great Britain.</p>
                     <p>The Tombs court-room was not very full. After the usual run of cases had
                        been cleared from the docket, however, the report that the "Great Wall
                        street Robbery" (as many called it) was on the file kept up the number of
                        attendants.</p>
                     <p>Prosper did not see very clearly, for a sort of blue must was in the room,
                        and gave the gas, lit here and there, a greenish tinge.</p>
                     <p>The atmosphere, loaded with the emanations from the audience, and the huge
                        stove and the heating pipes crossing the room, was very burdensome to the
                        prisoner.</p>
                     <p>Two or three cases passed, as "Mrs. Gamp and Mrs. Harris against Miss Prig,
                        for libel," "William Patterson against a man unknown, for assault and
                        battery," etc.</p>
                     <p>At last, "Prosper Roadside!"</p>
                     <p>The young man drew himself up, and let his attendants push him along to the
                        proper place. There was a buzz behind him, and he felt that all eyes were
                        upon him. Unknowing what better to do, he bit his lip to stop its tremor,
                        and looked at Justice Kogan, only a few feet from him.</p>
                     <p>"Stumble, place a chair for the gentleman—the evidence is likely to take
                        long," said he.</p>
                     <p>Prosper was quite overwhelmed by the attention, for he had expected to have
                        been treated with the utmost contempt. It appeared of favorable augury, and
                        restored him some freedom of mind.</p>
                     <p>"Don't sit down till the Justice is done with you," said Stumble, guessing
                        that Prosper was not used to the court business.</p>
                     <p>"Are you ready?" asked Mr. Kogan of his clerk. "Your name?"</p>
                     <p>"Prosper Roadside, sir."</p>
                     <p>"Your age?"</p>
                     <p>"I'll be thirty the fifth of next May."</p>
                     <p>"Your business?"</p>
                     <p>"Cashier——I mean I was cashier to Mr. Van Kieft—Broadway, near Liberty."</p>
                     <p>Mr. Kogan referred to a sheet of paper under his hand. Prosper began to
                        think that no man who seemed so far from prejudiced against him, could send
                        him back to prison.</p>
                     <p>"Where do you live?" inquired the Justice, resuming.</p>
                     <p>"No.—C. aremont avenue, the last four years."</p>
                     <p>"Are you a native of New York or Brooklyn?"</p>
                     <p>"No, sir; I was born over the river from Albany."</p>
                     <p>"Are your parents alive?"</p>
                     <p>"My mother died two years ago, but my father is alive. He lives with my only
                        sister, who is married to Mr. Harris J. Loening, one of the Erie Canal
                        resident examining engineers."</p>
                     <p>In a very shaky voice it was that Prosper gave his information; for though
                        there are periods in life when remembrance of ones family is a consolation
                        and encouragement, there are some dreadful moments when the sufferer wishes
                        to Heaven that he was a founding and all dead that bear his name.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Kogan remarked and noted the prisoner's emotion.</p>
                     <p>"What is your father?"</p>
                     <p>"He was something on the canal with my brother-in-law, but he retired so
                        long ago that I don't remember clearly what it was."</p>
                     <p>"Call Andrew Van Kiett," said the Justice, as Prosper sank back in his
                        seat.</p>
                     <p>The banker came forward from where he had been conferring with his lawyer,
                        unseen by Roadside, and entered on the witness stand.</p>
                     <p>He was hardly to be recognized as the same man.</p>
                     <p>As much as he was benevolent in his office, so was he angry against his
                        cashier in the court-room. Reflection, which usually brings the need of
                        pardon with its calm, had filled him with rage and a desire of
                        vengeance.</p>
                     <p>The formal questions relating to his charge had hardly been put to him than
                        off he started, covering Prosper with recriminations and even invectives.
                        The Justice had to reprimand him, reminding him of his own duty however,
                        much his clerk had failed in his. However smooth with the accused, the
                        Justice now became careful and attentive. Prosper's previous answers could
                        not let out much, but in the banker's there were the accessories the
                        peculiarities, the side-issues; and these many reeds of thin, frail
                        circumstances had to be bound up in a bundle before going to the mill, for
                        the extraction of the truth.</p>
                     <p>"For the present, sir," said the Justice to Mr. Van Kieft, "I beg you to
                        limit yourself to answering my questions. You accuse your cashier of having
                        stolen the sum of ninety-three thousand four hundred odd dollars?"</p>
                     <p>"Certainly."</p>
                     <p>Though the prisoner had twenty-four hours during which to familiarize
                        himself with this accusation, thus publicly pronounced, it overwhelmed him,
                        and he could not have uttered a word if that would have set him free.</p>
                     <p>"Did you ever have cause to suspect your cashier's probity?" proceeded the
                        Justice.</p>
                     <p>"No! And yet there were several matters that made me uneasy."</p>
                     <p>"Name them."</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Roadside, my cashier, was often seen in, or going into, or coming out
                        of, notorious gambling-houses. I learnt more than once of his having lost
                        large sums at faro and the new game, keno. Once, with one of my
                        acquaintances, Colonel Girard Haviland, he was arrested in the
                        gambling-house kept by a woman in Canal street, opposite Sullivan, and was
                        heavily fined for his disorderly conduct."</p>
                     <p>And so on for some seconds, the banker sharply tired at Prosper.</p>
                     <p>"It appears, sir," observed the Justice, when he had ceased the volley,
                        "that you are rather imprudent, not to say very careless, to have trusted
                        your cash-box to such a man!"</p>
                     <p>"I don't know, sir, about that," answered Mr. Van Kieft; "Mr. Roadside has
                        not always acted this way. Up to last year he was a model to men of his age.
                        Admitted into my family, he was part of it, spending evenings with us often,
                        the bosom friend of my eldest son. But it was very suddenly between dusk and
                        dark—he broke off his visits, and we saw no more of him. Indeed, I had
                        reason to believe that he was much attached to my niece, Miss Viandra
                        Oestervelt, who lives in my house.</p>
                     <p>The Justice's eyebrows came together in their habitual way when he thought
                        he had a clue. "May not that attachment have led to Mr. Roadside's
                        absence?"</p>
                     <p>The banker paused.</p>
                     <p>There was a slight confusion in court as a lawyer, who had been sent for,
                        made his appearance beside Roadside, and in rather a loud voice gave his
                        opinion that he ought to have been bailed out the day before, on "such a
                        preposterous charge!"</p>
                     <p>"I don't see why," returned Van Kieft, in a surprised tone. "I would most
                        willingly have given him my niece's hand, guardian as I am of her; and,
                        truth to say, I was expecting him to have come to me about it. My niece has
                        considerable money left her by her parents."</p>
                     <p>So, then, <emph>you</emph> see no motive for your cashier's conduct?"</p>
                     <p>"Absolutely none!" replied Van Keift, after some thought. "I always thought
                        Mr. Roadside had been drawn out of the right path by a young man whose
                        acquaintance he made about this time, in our house."</p>
                     <p>"A young man. By what name?"</p>
                     <p>"Burnett Clanmoran. A Southern gentleman, some relation of my wife—truly a
                        gentleman, except that he is what we call 'fast' now. By the bye, he is well
                        enough off to pay for his folies."</p>
                     <p>The Justice did not seem to be listening, he was so busy taking a note under
                        the name "Clanmoran, Burnett."</p>
                     <p>"And now again to the facts," he said. "Are you sure that the robbery could
                        not have been committed by any one belonging to your bank."</p>
                     <p>"As sure as I can be, sir."</p>
                     <p>"Does your key ever go out of your ha ds?"</p>
                     <p>"Rarely, at all events. When I don't carry it about me, I lock it up in a
                        drawer of my room."</p>
                     <p>"At your house?"</p>
                     <p>"At my dwelling-house."</p>
                     <p>"In that case—"</p>
                     <p>"I beg your pardon, sir," interrupted Van Kieft; "allow me to remark that
                        the key has very little to do with a steel safe like mine. In the first
                        place, the words must be known which the five knobs spell. With the
                           <emph>word,</emph> the safe <emph>might</emph> be opened without the key;
                        but, without the word the key itself——"</p>
                     <p>"You have told the word to nobody?"</p>
                     <p>"To nobody, sir. Sometimes, indeed. I would have been at a loss to say what
                        syllables fastened my safe. Mr. Roadside changed it when he saw fit, let me
                        know, and even then, I often forgot it from no necessity to use it."</p>
                     <p>"Did you forget the one in use yesterday?"</p>
                     <p>"No, it had been the new one after a change the day before, and its
                        singularity struck me. It was Gypsy, spelt in the old style, sir, with a
                        y."</p>
                     <p>The Justice took down the word.</p>
                     <p>"Where did you spend the night of the robbery?"</p>
                     <p>"I dined out with a friend of the member of the English Parliament examining
                        our schools, and we went to an evening address at Dr. Chapin's. When I went
                        home, about one o'clock, I instantly retired."</p>
                     <p>"You were unaware how much was in the safe?"</p>
                     <p>"Quite so. According to my positive orders, there ought to have been money
                        only for the day in it. I declared as much in the detectives' hearing, and
                        Mr. Roadside confirmed it."</p>
                     <p>"The detectives will give their evidence presently."</p>
                     <p>The Justice reflected. So far, all was in a nutshell. The banker being
                        ignorant of the hundred thousand dollars in his safe, and his cashier
                        drawing that sum against orders, the conclusion was easily drawn.</p>
                     <p>Seeing that he was left to himself, the capitalist fancied that he had a
                        good chance to say something to get into the, papers. So, glancing sidewise
                        at the reporters' table, he began;</p>
                     <p>"I believe I stand above suspicion, sir; and yet I shall not rest and be
                        thankful until the gutlty shall be clearly punished. Slander flies most
                        readily upon the successful man, and I may be calumniated. A hundred
                        thousand dollars is a fortune to tempt highwaymen. I will deem it as a favor
                        to have my books examined by an expert.——"</p>
                     <p>"We know nothing of favors <emph>here,</emph>" said the Justice, cutting the
                        speaker short, I think that's all."</p>
                     <p>Mr. Roadside's lawyer, who had been rapidly questioning him, rose and put
                        his hand out.</p>
                     <p>"One moment," said he, quickly. "Mr. Van Kieft, you dined out? Where?"</p>
                     <p>"My—my friend's house is in East Broadway. He is of a Quaker family, and,
                        though rich, prefers to live there."</p>
                     <p>"Hem, hem! In East Broadway. And you live——"</p>
                     <p>"In West Twenty-second street."</p>
                     <p>"That will do, till you are recalled," remarked the lawyer, in that tone of
                        his brother professionals, which implies that all lengths of rods are in all
                        bitterness of pickle for the witness' next appearance.</p>
                     <p>The clerk (a young Irishman, who, gifted with a dreamy notion that he was
                        born for a playwright, looked dramatically on all things,) whispered to the
                        Justice:</p>
                     <p>"A mysterious business, Misther Kogan, sir. If the cashier 'ull only keep
                        cool, it 'ull be very diffickilt to convict him!"</p>
                     <p>"Maybe," answered the Justice; but we've heard none of the other witnesses
                        yet."</p>
                     <p>Lucas Van Kieft, the banker's eldest son, a tall, fine fellow of five
                        and-twenty, was called.</p>
                     <p>He had only to say that he thought a great deal of Roadside; had been very
                        intimate with him, and had always considered him as a man incapable of a
                        shameful deed.</p>
                     <p>"Quite <emph>our</emph> witness," observed Prosper's lawyer to him.</p>
                     <p>Lucas declared that he could not understand how Roadside could have been led
                        into this crime. He knew that he gambled, because (be faltered) he (Lucas)
                        had gone along with him into several places, where he was surprised at
                        Roadside being so familiar with the "sports" and their "benemorts." He had
                        never known him to spend more money than he thought he had a right to.</p>
                     <p>As for his cousin, he said:</p>
                     <p>"I always believed that Miss Oestervelt was meant for Roadside, knowing that
                        my father would offer no resistance. I fancied there had been some little
                        tiff to have kept Prosper away from us, but felt sure the two would soon
                        make it up."</p>
                     <p>This evidence was better than Mr. Van Keift's for enlightening the cashier's
                        past, but revealed very little.</p>
                     <p>The clerks of the bank were examined. Very little was derived from them,
                        also. Sanderson, however, happened to let drop that he had heard that
                        Roadside and Clanmoran, in conjunction, had speculated heavily for a rise,
                        at the time of the Nova Scotia gold discoveries, and had made much
                        money.</p>
                     <p>Later, Gypsy, thanks to an anonymous note come by Boyd's post to Roadside's
                        lawyer, was</p>
                     <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC8328-00000011"/>
                     <p>Little Tommy Cragin was in a pitiful state when called up. Having, under
                        bond of the utmost secresy, related his adventure with the detective to a
                        friend of his, a lawyer's engrosser, the latter had gibed him dreadfully on
                        letting himself be bluffed out of the note. So he had been dying of remorse
                        all night long, and believed that he had ordered Roadside off to execution.
                        Hence, he tried to have the merit at least of undoing what he called his
                        betrayal.</p>
                     <p>He did not exactly lay the blame on his master, but he boldly said that the
                        cashier had been very good to him, and that folks might as well say he took
                        the money as Mr. Roadside. Unhappilly, besides his having no proof to
                        support his opinion his warm professions of impassioned friendship clipped
                        his evidence of much value.</p>
                     <p>The clerk whom Roadside had sent to the bank to get the money over night,
                        could not appear. He had been run over by a Second avenue car in Oliver
                        street, as a doctor's certificate affirmed.</p>
                     <p>Newlife and Hall testified.</p>
                     <p>The Justice rose at three in the afternoon, an hour after his regular dinner
                        time, and said that he adjourned the hearing till the next day.</p>
                     <p>On the next day Hall was cross-examined about what discovery he made
                        concerning Miss Raymond, he having been very chary the day before.</p>
                     <p>In trying alone to clear up the steel-safe robbery, he was playing a double
                        game, which threatened to get him into a scrape. His least risk was losing
                        his situation, if it was found out how he was feeding the Justice's bull
                        from his ambition cabbage.</p>
                     <p>So, this time, he went back on his previous faciturnity. He gave up the note
                        he had forced from Tom Cragin, and furnished a quantity of intelligence
                        about Roadsid's benders and Miss Gypsy Raymond's life. Of Viandra he took
                        care not to whisper one word.</p>
                     <p>The Justice glanced at the prisoner as much as to imply that he now began to
                        believe him guilty.</p>
                     <p>Jacob Hall took no steps to remove this impression. It was not his opinion,
                        but he was enchanted at the Justice taking the wrong track, thinking to
                        himself that now there would be still more glory to him when he succeeded.
                        How he was to succeed was still a puzzle however.</p>
                     <p>Later, Gypsy, thanks to an anonymous note, come by Boyd's post to Roadside's
                        lawyer, was produced and heard. For some hidden reason perhaps because he
                        knew quite enough about her, the Justice did not ply her with many cutting
                        questions, but he prevented her wearing her veil down, permitted only to
                        "real" ladies in his gallantry.</p>
                     <p>Cragin was recalled. Then Hall was slightly snubbed for his unwarrantable
                        house-finding for Gypsy. He cringed, and vanished from the court-room.</p>
                     <p>"From the expectation of the ends of justice in this important case being
                        thereby forwarded," said the Justice, "I remand the prisoner until the
                        second Tuesday in March."</p>

                        THE LEGAL ARTILLERY PLAYS—A GLEAM OF HOPE.</head>
                     <p>While his life was the object of minute investigation, Roadside was in
                        prison. He let two days slip by without doing anything. His lawyer came to
                        tell him that the amount of bail-bonds was so large that the "friends" he
                        had applied to for him, shrank from giving it. Prosper said, shortly, that
                        it mattered little, a week was only four more days, and he would be just as
                        wretched outdoors.</p>
                     <p>Then he wrote to his father and sister, telling them that he was unjustly in
                        prison, and that they need not trouble themselves about him, as he had a
                        good lawyer and money of his own to pay him, which, even on wrongful
                        conviction, the law could not prevent his disposing of. Some of his
                        acquaintances tried to get admission to him, but, refused, they could only
                        leave their cards at the lawyer's. Tom Cragin was of their number, and he
                        had given the lawyer a most woeful account of his remorse to be transmitted
                        to the prisoner.</p>
                     <p>So time passed, and the poor young man, tormented by his own thoughts far
                        more painfully than the tortures of old-time prisons could have done, sank
                        into the depths of despair.</p>
                     <p>"I might as well be here forever?" he cried; "Sing Sing would be a pleasant
                        change to this."</p>
                     <p>He was not forgotten, for on the second Monday in March, at an hour when the
                        jailers did not come around, he heard the door unfastened.</p>
                     <p>He rose, and would have hastened to it, but on the threshold appeared a
                        white-headed old man, whose aspect smote him as with lightning.</p>
                     <p>"My father!" he ejaculated. "Father!"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, your father!"</p>
                     <p>To Roadside's first impulse of amaze, immense joy succeeded; for a father is
                        the man before all in whom trust can be placed. In moments of emergency,
                        when all fall off from you, you recall the man on whom you leant when a
                        child, and his mere presence sets you quite at rest. Without reflecting,
                        inspired by a burst of affection, Prosper would have caught his father's
                        hand, but he was roughly repulsed.</p>
                     <p>The door closed.</p>
                     <p>The father and son were left together, Prosper broken and disheartened. Mr.
                        Roadside irritated, almost threatening. Repulsed by his father, the cashier
                        appeared to be under the influence of a stab from a poisoned blade.</p>
                     <p>"You, too," he groaned, "you, too, believe me guilty!"</p>
                     <p>"Don't try with me what has not succeeded in the courts," interposed Mr.
                        Roadside; "I know all!"</p>
                     <p>"I am innocent, father, as true as dear mother above sees me, I hope!"</p>
                     <p>"You wretched boy, how dare you even mention her!"</p>
                     <p>An irresistible soothing swayed him, for it was in a weak and hardly
                        intelligible voice that he proceeded:</p>
                     <p>"Prosper, I never thought that a day would come when I should be the happier
                        that your poor mother was taken away. Your criime would have been the death
                        of her!"</p>
                     <p>There was a long silence.</p>
                     <p>"Father, you take the life out of me," said Roadside at last, "when I most
                        want it! at the very time when some most shameful plot has got me down and
                        crawls over me——"</p>
                     <p>"Victim!" sneered old Roadside, "victim! So you <emph>will</emph> try to
                        stain with insinuations the good and honorable man who took care of you and
                        made you what you were, and gave you a prospect such as I never had dreamed
                        of for my boy. The theft 's enough—don't try to lie it off upon
                        another!"</p>
                     <p>"For mercy's sake, father, let me assure you——"</p>
                     <p>"What! are you going to deny that he has been good to you? Once you were so
                        sure of his good will that you wrote to me to say you could rely upon his
                        giving you his ward, his niece's hand. Was that a falsehood, too?"</p>
                     <p>"No, no," answered Prosper, half suffocated.</p>
                     <p>"That was a year ago. You were in love with the young lady—at least you
                        wrote me so."</p>
                     <p>"And I love her still, more than ever! I never have ceased to love her!"</p>
                     <p>"For shame!" cried old Roadside, with sorrowful pity. "Could not thought of
                        that pure, chaste maiden arrest you on the threshold of debauchery? You love
                        her! How dared you, without a blush, appear before her after leaving your
                        vile companions?"</p>
                     <p>"In heaven's name, let me explain to you how Viandra——"</p>
                     <p>"Enough, enough. I know all. I saw Mr. Van Kieft yesterday. This morning I
                        saw Mr. Justice Kogan, by whose kindness I am here. Otherwise I would have
                        been searched before I would have been let in. Everybody is so sure of your
                        guilt, that it is thought that you may kill yourself."</p>
                     <p>The young man no longer argued, but sank despairing on his bed.</p>
                     <p>"I have been to your house—I don't mean the respectable rooms where you
                        pretended to live—and by that I understood your crime. I have seen silk
                        window-curtains, and lace inside them, and painted satin shades inside them
                        again! Pictures of a vicious sort, with deep gilt frames, covered the walls.
                        In my father's house, around whose walls the British bullets whistled, in
                        the days when men wore homespun that their <emph>wives</emph> had knit, the
                        walls were whited over with lime at best; and if there was such a thing as
                        an arm-chair in the house, it stood by the fire for my old mother. Our
                        luxury lay in our honesty. You are the first of our name who has had
                        three-fingers-thick carpets; but you are the first thief that ever was tried
                        by our name!"</p>
                     <p>Upon this new insult, Prosper's blood flowed again, but still he did not
                        stir.</p>
                     <p>"But luxury's the order of the day now," pursued Mr. Roadside, warming up by
                        his own words. "Young men want to roll in riches before they have earned the
                        riches. You keep women who wear satin slippers lined with swansdown—the like
                        of those I have seen in your room! Your servants dress in livery—in livery,
                        by heaven! like the English noblemen's, who travel among us to pretend they
                        never heard of Warren and Putnam and Schuyler—(perhaps <emph>their</emph>
                        particular fathers were the ones who didn't get home to tell of the
                        chicken-hawk shooters of the Mohawk Valley!) No wonder you steal! Our
                        moneyed men daren't trust their cashiers with their safe-keys. Of course,
                        every morning, some unexpected robbery stains honorable families."</p>
                     <p>He stopped abruptly, seeing that his son was in no state to listen to
                        him.</p>
                     <p>"But let that rest," he continued, "I didn't come here—for the first time
                        inside a prison—to reproach you, but to save, if possible, some of our good
                        fame, and prevent our name appearing in the police reports among the
                        convicted felons. Sit up, and hear me."</p>
                     <p>Upon the imperious order, Prosper rose. So many successive attacks had
                        reduced him to that state of wild insensibility when a man no longer fears
                        anything that may come.</p>
                     <p>"In the first place," inquired Mr. Roadside, "how much is left of the ninety
                        thousand odd you took?"</p>
                     <p>"Father, I tell you again: I am innocent!" replied the young man, in a voice
                        of painful resignation.</p>
                     <p>"I expected you'd say so, so we'll have to make it up between
                        ourselves."</p>
                     <p>"We? You? Who?"</p>
                     <p>"The day the Albany papers had it all in, your brother-in-law came to
                           <unclear>tell</unclear> me he could raise half at once. Uncle Saul is
                        good for almost as much more, and I'll make up the deficiency
                           <emph>somehow.</emph> Mr. Van Keift is reasonable."</p>
                     <p>"Father, you'll not do any such thing," interrupted the cashier, starting
                        out of his bewilderment.</p>
                     <p>"But I will—and before the day's over, I'll arrange it with Mr. Van Kieft so
                        that the law will have to go on against you without him, and I don't think
                        it can then do much. I can live on little—shutters are enough for
                           <emph>my</emph> windows—and brother-in-law won't mind pinching one
                        winter. He's honest and will make up for it in another year." The speaker
                        stopped short, alarmed by his son's expression, so furious a rage that it
                        was near akin to madness, contracted his features, and his lately dulled
                        eyes were full of fire.</p>
                     <p>"Father, you have no right to go on this way," he cried. "You're free to
                        refuse to believe me, but you have no claim to ruining me by such a step.
                        This ain't 1830, when there was only one paper in each capital in the
                        States! My name's public now. Mr. Van Kieft cannot hold back. The District
                        Attorney would just like to see him forbear to prosecute, I guess! How do
                        you know I'm guilty? Because I've cut a dash! Morality apart, they sell silk
                        and diamonds in the stores <emph>now,</emph> not calico, and corduroy, and
                        pinchbeck! What—when the law halts, you want to rush on and be more
                        merciless than justice! I told you to believe all was well, and let me
                        alone. I ain't afraid to fight it out by myself. Instead of that, you not,
                        only leave home to come down to the city, but must begin by worrying me and
                        condemning me without hearing me! There—I ain't talking like a son, I know:
                        but have you been talking like a father to me, eh?"</p>
                     <p>"I've been doing my duty."</p>
                     <p>"I stand on the end of the ferry-house bridge, waiting for the boat that
                        will save me, and you push me over, to throw me nearer it. Is that what you
                        call duty? Between outsiders, who accuse me, and me crying out that I am
                        innocent, <emph>you</emph> hesitate! Oh, father! Why? Because I am your son?
                        Because I've kept a girl—as if that was anything tempting! Some mistresses
                        cost less than an extravagant wife! You can cut those when they gouge your
                        pocket-book too hard; but try to shut down on the spending wife, and see how
                        soon the courts will say she must have half your cheque-book! Our good name
                        is in peril, that's true enough; but that's the very reason it should be
                        kept high up overhead, so that everybody can see that it is stainless! Help
                        me, sustain me, and all is more likely to go well."</p>
                     <p>This speech had so much in it calculated to shake the most solid convictions
                        that old Roadside was moved.</p>
                     <p>"But all's against you," muttered he.</p>
                     <p>The old roadster of twenty years back was dazzled by the pace of the modern
                        rattler.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, father; for no one knows how I was compelled to leave Viandra. I was
                        in despair, and I tried to find oblivion. But all I met with was shame and
                        disgner. Oh, Viandra, dearest! But who cares if all are against me?" he went
                        on, overcoming his momentary weakness. "I'll come out right, or I'll stay in
                        the darkness forever. Human justice is apt to err. I may be condemned,
                        guiltless as I am! I'll try the striped jacket; I'll work out my time; I'm
                        young enough not to die in Sing Sing——"</p>
                     <p>"What are you saying, unhappy boy?"</p>
                     <p>"I say that, after wrongful conviction, I'll be another man! My life will be
                        all for vengeance. I am the victim of some dark plot. S'long as as there's a
                        drop left in me I'll bunt after the plotters, and when I find them I'll make
                        them pay up with compound interest! Somebody in Van Kieft's has got a grudge
                        against me—that's where the trap was sprung. I know where to take up the
                        trail!"</p>
                     <p>"You are going out of your head with anger, my poor boy," said old
                        Roadside.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, I understand; you keep harping on Mr. Van Kieft's honesty; you'll tell
                        me all the virtues repose in the bosom of his family. Repose there? Aye,
                        maybe, but too fast asleep! What<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC8328-00000012"/> do
                        you know of it? City life beats country life all to bits! Why did Miss
                        Ostervelt come and tell me one day that I must never more think of her? Why
                        has she banned me, exiled me, when she suffered as much by the parting
                        herself as I do, for she loves me still—do you mark? She loves me this very
                        hour, father! and would marry me this cell, if she could! I as good as hold
                        the proof, dear girl!"</p>
                     <p>The jailer knocked. Mr. Roadside was not limited in his stay, but the
                        cashier's legal adviser was come.</p>
                     <p>A thousand different feelings tore at the poor father's hearistrings, and
                        prevented any freedom in reflection. If Prosper should be speaking the truth
                        after all? What then would have been his remorse for having piled up his
                        woes, previously so high. And what proved that he was deceiving?</p>
                     <p>The voice of the son so long a pride unto him had re-awakened all the
                        paternal impulses compressed only by violence. Guilty or not guilty, even of
                        such a crime, was he any the less his boy? So severity had faded from his
                        visage, and his eyes gleamed with tears ready to fall. He tried to go forth
                        grave and irritated as he had entered, but he had not such cruel courage. He
                        caught Prosper's hand and pressed it tightly.</p>
                     <p>"May it be so, my son!" he said.</p>
                     <p>Prosper was in the seventh heaven, for he had almost convinced his father of
                        his innocence.</p>
                     <p>The door opened to let out old Roadside and let in Mr. Emery, the
                        lawyer.</p>
                     <p>"Stay, father," said the cashier; "you ought to know my defender. This is my
                        father, sir!"</p>
                     <p>The gentlemen bowed.</p>
                     <p>The lawyer was rather a young man, and it was personal knowledge of Prosper
                        that had induced him to enter upon the defence with more vigor than perhaps
                        he would have otherwise displayed.</p>
                     <p>The cell door had not yet been closed. A man, rather tall, in a quiet black
                        suit, with gold-rimmed spectacles, was standing where he had just parted
                        from Mr. Emery.</p>
                     <p>"Good day, Mr. Newlife, then," said the latter, waving his hand; "much
                        obliged for your information."</p>
                     <p>Detective Newlife darted a quick look, which seemed to comprise all, upon
                        the two Roadsides, and the door closed between them.</p>
                     <p>"Newlife! Mr. Newlife!" repeated Prosper, starting "Surely I—I—why, that's
                        the detective who came to our place—if it is the same, for, except being
                        about the same in hight, I wouldn't have known him."</p>
                     <p>"It's the same; he has no brother or mate," answered the lawyer, sitting
                        down on the bed, to give the single chair to the elder gentleman.</p>
                     <p>"Is he disguised again?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh, yes! he's dressed differently.</p>
                     <p>"But, I mean, he looks differently, too," said Prosper.</p>
                     <p>"Ah! the fact is, there are not many people who can boast of now he really
                        looks <foreign xml:lang="FRA">au naturel,</foreign> as the oysters are at
                        Clark's. I've seen him like a very chameleon: yellow, red, black and white,
                        younger than he'll ever be again, and old enough to be your father's
                        father." Then, quickly turning serious, he glanced rapidly from one to the
                        other, and back again, and, looking at old Mr. Roadside, inquired:</p>
                     <p>"Have you found out anything about the money?"</p>
                     <p>"If I knew, sir," said Prosper, answering for himself, "I should be at
                        large, and not here."</p>
                     <p>"So we must still point at Mr. Van Kieft?"</p>
                     <p>"At whoever may have done it—him or somebody else."</p>
                     <p>"No! we cannot go beyond him, as he alone knew the key-word. What interest
                        do you believe he had in robbing himself? I don't like to speak out before
                        your father, but—but he'll hear it somewhere anyhow, and there's no time
                        like the present," continued Mr. Emery. "The case bears most against you,
                        because there seems such a motive for your acting wrongly. Can you say how
                        much you've spent ma year?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh, yes," answered Prosper, without hesitation. "I had reasons for keeping
                        some rule in all my disorder. I ran through some ten thousand dollars."</p>
                     <p>Old Roadside drew a long breath.</p>
                     <p>"I could easily do it," continued Presper. "I had about three thousand from
                        you, father, as I wanted it. From Mr. Van Kieft, my salary and interest on
                        my money invested with him. I made about two thousand by stock-broking. I
                        borrowed the margin, but could always pay it with the three thousand I have
                        of my own at Van Kieft's."</p>
                     <p>"Who lent you the money?"</p>
                     <p>"All one hand. My friend, Burnett Clanmoran."</p>
                     <p>"Just the man I was speaking with Detective Newlife about. Clanmoran's still
                        out of town; he went away the night of the robbery. Now, just repeat,
                        slowly, why, notwithstanding the banker's orders, you sent for the cash
                        overnight, and not in the morning."</p>
                     <p>"Why, it was this way: Colonel Haviland told me that he wouldn't have all
                        the morning to himself; and so, fearing I would be late down to the bank, I
                        thought it best to save him some of his time. He ought to be called in as
                        witness."</p>
                     <p>"Yes; I have him down. Is he a friend of yours?" asked the lawyer.</p>
                     <p>"The Colonel? Not much. I'm rather down on him, if anything, for no reason,
                        though. He's very thick with my friend Clanmoran."</p>
                     <p>"Queer! Well," went on Mr. Emery, "I asked you, last time, to write down and
                        correct at leisure an account of how you spent the night of the 28th
                        ultimo."</p>
                     <p>"So I did."</p>
                     <p>"Just read it, and I'll note it.</p>
                     <p>Prosper took a paper off his table, and said, referring to it:</p>
                     <p>"I left the bank a little late, at five in the afternoon. Walking up
                        Broadway, it was twenty after by St. Paul's clock, as I stopped to look at a
                        new style of hat in Knox's window. In Barnum's porch there was a girl I—I
                        had seen before—they call her Lizzie White around Mercer street, and I lent
                        her—well. I gave her—five dollars, as she wanted to buy an umbrella before
                        she went into the Museum."</p>
                     <p>"I suppose she can be found. That's a good point," muttered the lawyer.</p>
                     <p>"Then I walked through the Park, caught a Fourth avenue car going down
                        Centre street hill, and rode up to Fifteenth street, to the house where
                        Clanmoran boards. I had four hundred dollars, and a pipe set with clam-shell
                        cameos, in my pocket, which I'd promised him. He was out, and I left the lot
                        with Mrs. Baize, the landlady. She did not say he had gone off to the
                        country anywere, and I had no hint that he was going."</p>
                     <p>"Very well."</p>
                     <p>"I crossed over, and sat down a few minutes in Union square, to watch some
                        children skating in the slush and snow. It was just beginning to thaw, if
                        you remember; I went down Broadway as far as the oyster saloon near
                        Wallack's New Theater, and treated a girl who works for the florists across
                        the way—treated her to some oysters. Then I went home."</p>
                     <p>Prosper paused. The mention of "girl" and "girl" had caused his father to
                        turn to frowning again.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, your father will learn it all quick enough," said Mr. Emery. "Get along
                        with your story. The more people you met the better. We'll have them all up,
                        and account for every hour of the time!"</p>
                     <p>Prosper did not join in the delight at so excellent an alibi lcoming up.</p>
                     <p>"Well, I dressed myself, had a cup of tea, and about ten I went out for a
                        stroll. I know Algy Williams, who dancers in the village scene in
                        'Evangeline,' at the Winter Garden, and, after the piece, I saw her
                        home."</p>
                     <p>"Miss Williams," observed Emery to old Roadside, who had set his teeth close
                        as he listened, "is a ballet-dancer who has a carriage and pair out of young
                        Van Runst's stables, on four dollars fifty a week! She's a gambler, too; eh,
                        Mr. Roadside?"</p>
                     <p>"Some sporting-men call in at her house," answered Prosper in a more and
                        more subdued voice. "She had her friends there this night, and I lost seven
                        fifties by playing on a 'sure thing' that old Scribner put me up to. We
                        played 'Boston.' I had won twenty just before with Miss Williams and I
                        against two girls, and the rule is to always champagne the losers when
                        they're women. I was about five hundred out that night. I had a hundred at
                        home, and pretty near that in my pocket-book."</p>
                     <p>"Let's see. In one day you paid away nine hundred. Just account for it,
                        please."</p>
                     <p>"Why, that morning I sold some Lackawanna coal, and some 1850 New York City
                        bonds, to bring me in close to a thousand, and I took a hundred in small
                        bills out of my safe in advance of my quarter."</p>
                     <p>It was clear enough.</p>
                     <p>"That's all very well. Now, about that note you tried to give the office-boy
                        without anybody seeing you. They're going to make a mountain of it. Kogan is
                        fierce on such apparent trifles."</p>
                     <p>"Why," said Prosper, slowly, "I wanted to hide the girl——"</p>
                     <p>"Gypsy?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, Miss Raymond. I knew well enough, if only from
                           <unclear>Halpiner</unclear> and Heimer letting their receiving-teller
                        skylark as much as he liked—yes, for three years—until he took a poor girl,
                        starving to death for a bonnet-trimming rascal in Catherine street, and gave
                        her a home to make a lady of her, and then they came down on him; and though
                        they could'nt find a blot in all his books, or a dot off an i, yet they
                        sacked him."</p>
                     <p>The "fast"-youth's tone was tinging Prosper's speech again, when, very low,
                        but still audible, old Roadside muttered, as if some thought was
                        determinedly forcing itself upon him:</p>
                     <p>"Remove thy way from the strange woman, lest thou give thine honor unto
                        others."</p>
                     <p>"I mean, then," proceeded the young man, "that I was not ignorant how all
                        the weaknesses of a man become terrible engines when an accusation is laid
                        against him."</p>
                     <p>"That's the worse feature," observed Mr. Emery, who, we regret to say,
                        thought little of the strict morality of facts when he had a client to
                        deliver. "No judge can overlook the scandal of such unions. "No judge can
                        overlook the scandal of such unions. They are a perpetual defiance flung in
                        the face of public good. I have had a long talk with Newlife about this
                        girl. You understand, he works for justice, and he wouldn't keep anything
                        back from me. Dou you know all about her? He does."</p>
                     <p>"Why," said Prosper, "I'll tell the truth. I saw her several mornings and
                        evenings on the Atlantic avenue ferry-boat, coming over. I got to talking
                        with her. I found out she had been a primary-school-teacher in Boston; was
                        out of work, was poor, quite alone, but liked 'fun,' and so she rather
                        easily was drawn away by me."</p>
                     <p>"Rather easily, I should say!" remarked Mr. Emery, opening his note-book in
                        a new place. "This Miss Gypsy Raymond never was a school-teacher; she never
                        was in Boston; never was <emph>quite</emph> alone!"</p>
                     <p>The young man started.</p>
                     <p>"Look here—I mean, listen. And, Mr. Roadside," added the lawyer, who had
                        turned his face away, "you should just notice the life some young women can
                        lead in a short time. Jane Rowland was born about 1842 in the laundry-room
                        of a Philadelphia prison, female side, probably Moyamensing. Father unknown;
                        mother, who d ed soon after the birth, was working out a year's hard labor
                        for complicity in a highway robbery in the market. A warder's wife took a
                        fancy to her and kept her till she was twelve years old. She ran away one
                        day when the woman took her to town, and was only seen again when, at the
                        age of sixteen, the warder, now employed in what was known as the
                           <emph>New</emph> Penitentiary, found her committed for setting fire to a
                        house of ill-fame, whose keeper had quarrelled with her."</p>
                     <p>Prosper shook his head.</p>
                     <p>"Stay! A turnkey let her escape one night, but was shot and had his leg
                        broken in trying to follow her over the cook-house wall. <emph>That</emph>
                        was all <emph>he</emph> made by it. She came to New York, became servant to
                        Mr. Bassdrum, grocer, 198 Rochester avenue, over the river. That same year
                        she changed from place to place, presumably having stolen petty articles in
                        each of the half dozen, causing her to quit. Next year she was waitrese at
                        Sybil's Cave, Hoboken, and a Bergen paper started an absurd story that she
                        was daughter of the Queen of the Gypsies, who used to tell fortunes
                        thereabouts in the old days, about 1835, etc. The Hoboken gypsies were well
                        known, by-the-by. That's how she came to be called 'Gypsy,' whatever she may
                        have told you when you found out that she answered to that name."</p>
                     <p>"She said always that it was a pet name that her family had given her in
                        childhood," said Prosper.</p>
                     <p>"Very pretty. She's artful enough, I believe, from only seeing her on trial.
                        You know I never visited you, my friend, in your Rochambeau-place
                        residence," observed the lawyer, smiling faintly. "But I was going to say
                        she gave up the selling of cool water, having something to do with an
                        English painter who was sketching the Hudson scenery. They lived in Bergen
                        until, not long after, he got a warrant out for her, having laid his cheek
                        open with a table-knife, and threatening him so that he was in fear of his
                        life, etc., etc. She had six months in the Bergen House of Correction, but
                        there is reason to believe that her beauty, beginning to be manifest,
                        alleviated much of the penalty. She disappeared, then, on release, to let
                        her hair grow, no doubt; and next she makes the acquaintance of Clayton
                        Palmer, a man brought into public notice by his inventions, such as coling
                        apples, dressing string-beans, and such like, very profitable, though lot to
                        him, as vou will see. At any rate, Jane Rowland lived with Mr. Palmer as his
                        wife, at Bannister's Hotel, on Atlantic avenue, South Brooklyn. She was
                        bearing his name, I repeat, when she met you on the boat, etc., etc., and
                        went off with you."</p>
                     <p>"I never heard any of the names you use," said Prosper, dumbfounded.</p>
                     <p>"Not Clayton?"</p>
                     <p>"Never."</p>
                     <p>"The poor fellow was very fond of the creature, and, but that he knew a
                        great deal too much of her life, might have really married her. When she ran
                        away he nearly went mad over it. It appears he was not only of inventive
                        mind, but energetic, and he publicly swore that he'd be even with the man
                        who had stolen away his girl."</p>
                     <p>The cashier shook his head.</p>
                     <p>"No such man ever paid me a visit," he remarked.</p>
                     <p>"Ah, that's because there's every reason to believe he has committed
                        suicide."</p>
                     <p>"What a pity!"</p>
                     <p>"It's sure that soon after Miss Raymond, as you thought her, vanished, he
                        paid up at the hotel and disappeared. Detective Newlife, who has<pb
                           n="24-25" xml:id="VAC8328-00000013"/> given me most of this information,
                        says nobody knows anything about him from Dan to Beersheba."</p>
                     <p>Old Roadside turned round. He had heard, without much wishing to.</p>
                     <p>"You see, Prosper. You think yourself a complete city man, and yet a mere
                        girl has deceived you.'</p>
                     <p>The young man had been too much amazed by such a revelation to remember
                        scarcely more than the name "Clayton" of him whom he had so deeply wronged.
                        How often had he said he would pistol any of his best friends who might
                        seduce Gypsy from him!</p>
                     <p>"Confess, my boy, that this dreadful creature has been your ruin," said his
                        father.</p>
                     <p>"I can't do that, for it is not so. I <emph>have</emph> spent a good deal of
                        money on her, I know, but I did it with my eyes open, and I carefully booked
                        the figures."</p>
                     <p>"Come, come," said Mr. Emery, "I thought I would have a chance to hint that
                        she was the cause of your breaking up your habit of spending your evenings
                        with Mr. Van Kieft."</p>
                     <p>"Oh, no, she never had that much power over me."</p>
                     <p>"Then why did you abruptly keep away from a house where a lady, believed to
                        be your intended by every one—I can answer for myself—was always ready to
                        receive you?"</p>
                     <p>"I have told my father something about this, sir, rejoined Prosper, "but I
                        can only be silent with you, my friend."</p>
                     <p>"Um!" and Mr. Emery put on his considering cap. "The fact is, Charles
                        O'Conor himself would drop a case where the client keeps so close on what
                        the defense ought to know."</p>
                     <p>"I can't help it; I'm duty bound."</p>
                     <p>"Pooh! nothing rises above the client's duty to be frank to his defender.
                        Well, well, have your way," said Mr. Emery.</p>
                     <p>"But," exclaimed Prosper, annoyed, "it seems to me I've plenty of facts on
                        my side. If I had ever taken so much money, would I have been such a fool as
                        to go next morning to the bank?"</p>
                     <p>Old Roadside looked up.</p>
                     <p>"Present company excepted," answered Emery, clinchingly; "that's no
                        argument. You only would show your intelligence by staying to confront the
                        storm. This ain't the sailing-packet days. The railroad cars go faster than
                        they did, but the telegraph is a caution to them. The Collins steamers from
                        this city beat the Boston Cunarders, and an American is easily found in
                        London, and on the Continent especially. Make the reward big enough, and
                        nobody can hide himself long. Now, folks say, just what the newspaper, the
                        DAILY NEWS, smartly puts forward, that you taught to yourself: "I'll stay
                        here, and, after the worst, say Sing Sing, I'll have a fortune to enjoy."
                        Many's the man who would cut off five years or seven of his life for ninety
                        thousand dollars."</p>
                     <p>"It it comes to that," said Prosper. "I could have cleared out the whole
                        bank just as well as take that much."</p>
                     <p>"That's foreseen; for the reply is, you didn't have the chance."</p>
                     <p>The cashier's contracted brows proved that he was struggling with his
                        memory.</p>
                     <p>"Ah!"</p>
                     <p>"What?" cried old Roadside.</p>
                     <p>"Well?" said Mr. Emery quite as eagerly.</p>
                     <p>"A stray thought! It is gone—but it was good! What were your words—bank?
                        money? I have it! It's something!"</p>
                     <p>"Well, well?"</p>
                     <p>"Laylor—who brought the cash from the bank—came back while I was waiting for
                        him in the safe-room. I am sure, yes, sure, that I put all the money in and
                        locked up the steel safe before his eyes."</p>
                     <p>"Important!" exclaimed Mr. Emery. "I ought to have known this before! I
                        might have made something of it."</p>
                     <p>"Oh, if Laylor noticed it! If only! Anyhow, I left the bank before he
                        did."</p>
                     <p>The lawyer pondered over the little fact.</p>
                     <p>"This Mr. Laylor is the man who was run over by the cars?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, not dead?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh, no; bad, though!"</p>
                     <p>It seemed to be carrying a plan too far for the cashier, if guilty, to have
                        carefully locked up the treasure, when, by the slightest excuse he might
                        have sent away the single witness upon him, taken the cash and slipped off,
                        with all the night before him.</p>
                     <p>"Well, I'll go see him!" said Mr. Emery. "There's nothing more to be done
                        here. Go to sleep early so as to be cool to-morrow. Mr. Roadside, please
                        don't distress your son, as I leave you to your farewell making. More from
                        what Mr. Newlife, the detective, has hinted to me than from this little
                        point neglected by your son, I hope we'll get him off. Good day, sir!
                        Good-bye, Prosper! Mind you don't sit up late!"</p>
                     <p>At the door he turned.</p>
                     <p>"And, there," said he, "I was going off without knowing where to."</p>
                     <p>The door had opened at his knock. Mr. Newlife's spectacles gleamed in the
                        lobby as he peered in upon Prosper on his father's breast.</p>
                     <p>"Don't trouble him to find that out, Mr. Emery," said the detective, drawing
                        the lawyer cut of the cell. "I know Layler's address."</p>
                     <p>They went down stairs together. In the street a hack was waiting.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, a coach!" cried the lawyer. "Just what I want."</p>
                     <p>"I engaged it," said Newlife; "but as I am going to the same place, you
                        won't, perhaps, mind my going with you?"</p>
                     <p>The two were soon on their way to Laylor's house.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps, as the case was very serious, the lawyer alone would not have been
                        permitted to see the sufferer by the accident. The detective, whose
                        motionful life had made him acquainted with the doctor in attendance, had
                        better fortune.</p>
                     <p>On seeing the lawyer, whom he but vaguely remembered, and the detective,
                        whose changed aspect prevented him being recognized at all, the wounded
                        clerk raised his head from the pillow, steaming with sweat that the pain he
                        was in forced from him. The intruders explained their business.</p>
                     <p>"I hope it won't too much distress you to answer me," said the lawyer,
                        acting as notary-public for the nonce, as he had a license to do, it being
                        "so handy."</p>
                     <p>"Oh, no; I can (ah!) talk! 'Tis a relief, too!"</p>
                     <p>"Now, Mr. Laylor, you went to the bank for the money that was afterward made
                        away with?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes."</p>
                     <p>"What time did you get back?"</p>
                     <p>"To our bank? Rather late, for they were some time getting our money ready,
                        though they had a day's warning. It must have been near five when I
                        returned."</p>
                     <p>"Now, please state what Mr. Roadside did when you handed him the sum. Don't
                        be in a hurry to answer, but take your time."</p>
                     <p>"First, he counted the packets, of course; this was in the steel safe-room,
                        and the safe-door was open; he had been waiting only for me. He shut the
                        safe-door, and, as I was curious, for we don't often in the office see this
                        safe. I saw him lock it. That is, he was between me and the knobs, so that I
                        couldn't see the letters in a line, but still I heard the bolts click."</p>
                     <p>"Then——"</p>
                     <p>"Then he went out, and I shut the room door behind us."</p>
                     <p>"<emph>You</emph> shut the room door on going out after him?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes. But he was close to me, of course. He's not so careless as that, not
                        he."</p>
                     <p>"You are quite sure of what you say?"</p>
                     <p>Emery's solemn question appeared to frighten the clerk, who, forgetting his
                        broken leg, uttered a groan as he started.</p>
                     <p>"Sure?" he repeated, with marked hesitation; "why, you know—I took no
                        particular account at the time; but, yes, he did go out first!"</p>
                     <p>It was no use to endeavor to extract more from him. He was alarmed. He saw
                        he had put his foot in, and for the least trifle would have drawn back. He
                        signed the affidavit most hesitatingly.</p>
                     <p>But an effect had been produced on Mr. Emery, and, as he went out with
                        Newlife (who had excused himself from witnessing the deposition under
                        pretext that the doctor and the first-floor tenant would do better), he
                        said:</p>
                     <p>"The cloud shows the silver lining for Prosper, but scowls very black yet at
                        somebody unknown."</p>
                     <p>"At somebody!" echoed Newlife, with a curious tone. "Unknown?"</p>

                        MAN THAT FIRST INVENTED WRITING.—FLY AWAY, LADY-BIRD!</head>
                     <p>GYPSY'S refuge, so soon discovered or, rather, revealed by Jacob Hall, the
                        Old Pear Tree House, was a very good sore of hotel in its wa y. Mrs.
                        Margetson was really the wife of Coon Hall, but the latter's name was never
                        uttered there, and he himself kept his detective business secret while
                        inside its doors.</p>
                     <p>Thanks to his intimacy with steamboat clerks and the hangers-on at the
                        railroad depots, the Pear Tree was pretty nigh always loaded with fruit,
                        that is, it had plenty of lodgers. Country youths come to town to get
                        employment, with well-off old folks to pay their legitimate bills; small
                        traders from the West and South, who had no trust in drummers, but came to
                        pick their goods themselves; travelers come down the river, or from the
                        East, to see "York' such were the general run of the patrons, all the more
                        preferable because they only slept, supped and breakfasted at the house, and
                        were absent all the day through.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Margetson (to keep to her name before it became "Hall") had been a fine
                        woman, but now she had expanded into a huge one, dreadfully tortured by her
                        corsets, whose eyelets strewed the stairways, like cartridge cases after a
                        review, wherever she passed. She always dressed showily, and was flashing on
                        a Sunday, with a chain of gold beads cascading on her formidable bosom. Her
                        eyes were still bright, and what were left to her of teeth still white, but,
                        alas! her nose was red! Of all her tastes—and she had dabbled in a good
                        many, heaven knows, during her pilgrimage—one alone had clung to her. She
                        liked a good meal, well watered, and, when we say "watered," we mean
                        "liquored," for Croton she shunned, no less than if it had been the powerful
                        oil of that name. She had, like all big women who espouse undersized men,
                        considerable affection for her pigmy, and, on the afternoon when Prosper
                        Roadside was receiving his visitors, paternal and legal, Mrs. Margetson was
                        eagerly waiting for her husband.</p>
                     <p>She was about to have an early dinner (for the boarders came in about six
                        and took their dinner at seven), in the "office," a mere box the width of
                        one window, partitioned off from the parlor on the first floor.</p>
                     <p>We should have said that the ground-floor was a liquor saloon with which the
                        hotel had nothing to do.</p>
                     <p>About six years before the time we treat of, Jacob Hall had been doing a
                        little of the "private intelligence office" work, while police business was
                        slack; and Mrs. Margetson, who kept a very fancy milliner's store in the
                        Bowery, had chanced to set him to watching some of her "gay" customers.
                        Thence their intimacy, and their union, "quite according to Gunter," Jacob,
                        when intoxicated, had been known to assert loudly.</p>
                     <p>They worked so well together that they had enough resources, clubbed
                        together, to lease, and then buy, the old Pear Tree House. They prospered,
                        and the establishment was thought much of on that block; everybody, to the
                        very roundsman, being ignorant of the slow, insignificant little fellow
                        sneaking about the big landlady, being Jacob Hall, the detective.</p>
                     <p>"How late you are, my little man!" cried Mrs. Margetson, dropping the ladle
                        into the cabbage-soup turcen, as Coon suddenly made his appearance.</p>
                     <p>"I've been wasting time," said he in an absent way, as he took a chair at
                        the small table opposite her. "Who's in there?" he inquired, jerking his
                        thumb toward the boarding.</p>
                     <p>"In the parlor? Not a soul. That yellow-haired greenhorn, who is home-sick
                        about his native Hartford, was groaning on the sofy, till I gently roused
                        him up, and said a walk round Tompkins square to see the leafless trees and
                        the butcher boys snow-balling, would cheer him up! That started him."</p>
                     <p>"I've been playing billiards," said Hall, launching a flotilla of bread on
                        his soup-sea in his plate, "playing billiards all the day with Mr. Van
                        Kieft's man-servant. I let him win every other game. A loon that don't know
                        a mace from a cue without the name's chalked along the shaft! I made his
                        'quaintance the night before, and now we're thick as thieves. If I try to
                        get a sit., in place of the clerk who was run over by the horse-cars, I may
                        rely on Mr. Jerry's recommend."</p>
                     <p>"What! (take some more soup)—are you going to turn clerk?"</p>
                     <p>"Why not, if that should be the only way to study Van Kieft's bank, and see
                        the birds close to?'</p>
                     <p>"What did Jerry, if that's the loon's name, have to tell you?"</p>
                     <p>Hall pushed away his soup-plate and ran a fork into a slice of bread.</p>
                     <p>"Nothing! nothing of much use anyhow, and yet I turned him inside out like a
                        glove. You don't often come across such a man as this banker on a
                        plank-road; oh, no! not you! 'Cording to Jerry, he hasn't a hole in his
                        coat! He don't smoke or drink worth mentioning; he can't tell a picture-card
                        from a five-spot; he's <emph>every</emph> night at home! If he was to stand
                        up on the Worth monument for the first American Saint, he'd get his papers
                        to sit aloft, unanimous! He is worth ever so much, and yet he don't live in
                        as much state as the sass parilla man! He thinks a heap of his wife, a
                        Bergen Hill of his children, has plenty of preachers come to see him, but
                        very seldom goes out on a visit."</p>
                     <p>"Is his wife young?"</p>
                     <p>"If you draw the line far enough off from youth—No! She's fifty!"</p>
                     <p>"Of course you raked up particulars of the family," said Mrs. Margetson,
                        carrying a premature Spring chicken with all the skill boarding-house
                        proprietors attain.</p>
                     <p>"Of course. One boy left the Free Academy (another mean thing for a codfish
                        to belong to!) to enter West Point and be a <emph>cady</emph> there. The<pb
                           n="26-27" xml:id="VAC8328-00000014"/> elder what's his name? oh, Lucas—he
                        lives at home, and a tender chicken he is!"</p>
                     <p>The chicken which the speaker's good lady was mangling resented what it
                        perhaps fancied was an insult, by deliberately bristling its pin-feathers
                        and turning up the edge of the knife.</p>
                     <p>"This Lucas is a regular minister's daughter for
                           creaminess—<unclear>cuts</unclear> like cheese. The cashier took him off
                        on a spree one time and brought him home used up. He was sick for a month,
                        and couldn't sleep unless the <title>Evening Express</title> was on the
                        pillow by him."</p>
                     <p>"What's the wife?" said Mrs. Margetson, making the carving-knife fly up and
                        down the sides of the steel. "What's the pretty niece you spoke about?"</p>
                     <p>"Jerry knew nothing at all concerning them."</p>
                     <p>The boarding-house keeper dislocated the chicken's extremities by wrenching
                        the drumsticks off.</p>
                     <p>"There you are, Jake! and keep me the wish-bone, if you get it—it's my
                        weakness. Don't be savage over it. If <emph>you</emph> couldn't find
                        anything, it's because there isn't anything. I tell you what I'd do, if I
                        was you! I'd go and have a talk with Detective Newlife!"</p>
                     <p>At the name, Hall dropped the chicken-leg as if he had broken an eye-tooth
                        on it.</p>
                     <p>"I'd be off the books in half a minute. If Mr. Newlife only guessed what I
                        have been up to——"</p>
                     <p>"Who said you were to tell him your little spec? You can talk the thing over
                        with him, sound him, and watch how the wind blows."</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps you're right," said he thoughtfully; "and yet Mr. Newlife is
                        deucedly sharp, and more like to trump the jack, I'm thinking."</p>
                     <p>"Sharp!" retorted Mrs. Margetson, trodden on her "favorite corn;" "he,
                        sharp! You was the first of all the private squad when the Metropolitans
                        ousted the Municipals."</p>
                     <p>"I was, maybe; but since the ten or twelve months that Mr. Newlife's been in
                        with us, I'm nowhere."</p>
                     <p>"That be hanged, my little man. He's gone on a drunk with the reporters, and
                        then got you all to repeat he's the lead-horse, and that's built up his
                        reputation."</p>
                     <p>"At all events," said Jacob, polishing the drumstick in one hand, while his
                        other was chasing with his fork certain discs of beef in a bowl of vinegar,
                        "I'll think it over. How about Room Eight?"</p>
                     <p>Room Eight was Miss Raymond's. On coming to the Pear Tree House, she had
                        fully believed she was obeying sound advice, and, as Hall had never shown
                        himself, she remained under the impression that he was some friend of Mr.
                        Roadside's. When she had been summoned before Justice Kogan, she had admired
                        the cunning of the police for hunting her out so quickly. At court she had,
                        luckily for Hall, been in too excited a state to be undeceived, and he had
                        removed her the moment she had given her evidence.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheless, if she had not had affection for Prosper, her previous life
                        (related quite truly by Mr. Emery) would have furnished her with enough
                        knowledge to have kept her well guarded.</p>
                     <p>As it was, all of Mrs. Margetson's neat questions had failed to gain more
                        from her than part of the story which she had palmed off on the cashier.</p>
                     <p>The girl's in her room," answered the hotel-keeper.</p>
                     <p>"Suspects anything?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh, no!"</p>
                     <p>"It's a pity I had to show her at court."</p>
                     <p>"Yes; she came home as if flying off on a tangent. She talked high of going
                        to make the fur fly in Mr. Van Kieft's house. A little while ago she wrote a
                        letter after a fit of wrathiness, and gave it to John to put in the
                        post."</p>
                     <p>"A letter!" ejaculated Hall; "now why the mischief did'nt you give it to me
                        first off? Quick!"</p>
                     <p>Dropping his knife and fork, he ravenously snatched from his wife's hand a
                        letter which she drew from the capacious bosom of her dress.</p>
                     <p>For a girl who was so like a Crescent City <emph>place,</emph> Gypsey did
                        not write so bad a hand. The address was:</p>

                     <p>"Whew!" whistled Jacob.</p>
                     <p>"Are you going to open it?" inquired his better half.</p>
                     <p>"A little," answered Jake, surprised at her doubting his usual style of
                        going the whole hog.</p>
                     <p>Holding the envelope over the steam rising from the urnon the stove, he soon
                        melted the gum so that he could open the wrapper. Drawing the letter out, he
                        unfolded its catty-corners, quite in a girl's manner, and read, while his
                        wife, hitching her chair around, looked over his shoulders and read
                        likewise:</p>

                        <p>MY DEAR SIR: Prosper is in jail, with a robbery laid to him that he never
                           did, I'm downright certain. Three days ago I wrote you about this——</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>"Hullo!" Hall interrupted himself; "the jade's been writing letters, and
                           <emph>I</emph> never saw them!"</p>
                     <p>"Confound her young skin! she must have popped it into the post-office at
                        the Cooper Institute, when we took a walk out Friday night!"</p>
                     <p>"Oh, you ought to look sharper to these things! Girls ain't children these
                        times!" observed Coon a little calmer as he resumed the perusal.</p>

                                 <p>I wrote you about this, but have had no answer. If Mr.

                                    See here! if you don't give me some word on this, I'll think
                                    myself quit of a certain promise made you. I'll go back on you,
                                    and I'll tell Prosper all about that talk of your's with the

                     <p>Jacob pulled out his note-book and penciled off a copy of this note. Then he
                        delicately replaced the original in its case, sealed it anew, and had risen,
                        when the red head of the hotel-boy was shot in suddenly at the door, and a
                        Milesian accent thereunto appertaining said: "Hoosh!" for the "hush" of
                        English speech.</p>
                     <p>With marvelous rapidity, Jacob dived into a small glass-doored pantry, where
                        the books and boarders' valuables were kept. He had not time to well close
                        the door behind him, before Miss Raymond came into the office from the
                        entry.</p>
                     <p>She was much changed.</p>
                     <p>Her cheeks had not only lost color, but were sunken, her lips were stripped
                        of their tempting luster, and her eyes, shining with feverish fire and red
                        with tears, were ringed with bister. On beholding her, Mrs. Margetson was as
                        surprised as could be.</p>
                     <p>"Are you going out, my dear?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh, I must. I wanted to tell you to make anybody wait who may call for me
                        while I'm out."</p>
                     <p>"Going out—ill as you are?"</p>
                     <p>Gypsy hesitated an instant.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, I can trust in you, especially as it is nothing much. Here's a note
                        only just given me in my room——"</p>
                     <p>"A note—your room."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, a man brought it."</p>
                     <p>"Our John?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh, no; some poor man off the streets."</p>
                     <p>"A stranger—oh, oh, never mind," hummed and hawed the hotel proprietress, as
                        she took the paper.</p>
                     <p>In a voice loud enough to be heard in the pantry, she read as follows:</p>

                     </q>
                     <p>"Sybil of the Cave," said the landlady; "what's that mean? It's a girl, eh?
                        Sybil's a girl's name——"</p>
                     <p>"Very likely—I mean, yes; but whoever wrote that knows me well."</p>
                     <p>"Are you going?"</p>
                     <p>"Certainly."</p>
                     <p>"You'd better take John. He can follow you."</p>
                     <p>"Oh, no. Perhaps the stranger would not recognize me then."</p>
                     <p>"Oh, it's some trick—somebody wants to get you out of the way, to prevent
                        you giving evidence to-morrow."</p>
                     <p>"Who? My evidence does more harm to Mr. Roadside than good."</p>
                     <p>"Oh, then, some policeman wants to put you in the House of Detention; he'll
                        say he caught you trying to leave the city——"</p>
                     <p>"I don't care! I aint made to sit moping in a room! I'm too wretched to fear
                        anything. Good-by—you've been very good to me."</p>
                     <p>And, without listening to another word, she ran out of the room and down
                        stairs.</p>
                     <p>Out jumped Coon Hall from his retreat. The lamblike officer was green with
                        fury, and he swore like a Mississippi raftsman whose spread of timber had
                        been broken into separate logs by a sawyer.</p>
                     <p>"Well, what in the name of all that's billed-a-lobster-red do you call this
                        'ere house, that every rough-scuff can walk into it out of the gutter and
                        deliver letters to every boarder in it! I'd like to know, I just would!"</p>
                     <p>The giant landlady, trembling and disconcerted, knew not where to hide her
                        diminished head.</p>
                     <p>"Who ever heard of the like?" roared the detective: "a man's walked up our
                        stairs and nobody's seen him! Where's John, till I wring his head off! How
                        did the sneaker sidle into here? I smell a mice! And here <emph>you</emph>
                        are, Mrs. Margetson! you've been meek enough, and mild enough, and
                           <unclear>teetolly</unclear> unconsarned enough to let the little minx
                        walk off——'</p>
                     <p>"I couldn't——"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, you could help it, too! There she goes, down to the Second avenue.
                        Lend me a hand, I must follow her close."</p>
                     <p>He dived into the pantry with his wife, and when he almost instantly came
                        out, he had become one of those shabby drunken fellows always looking for a
                        job, but never seen in work; they are one remove from "bummers," who never
                        look for anything.</p>
                     <p>"Warm John's ears for me, and make him post that letter," said Jacob,
                        donning a rusty beaver that would have been the "justifiable suicide" of
                        Knox.</p>
                     <p>Without listening to his wife's "good luck," he darted downstairs.</p>
                     <p>Gypsy had turned the Second avenue corner only, the block being long, and
                        Jake easily caught up with her. He crossed over and kept pace with her by a
                        lounging gate.</p>
                     <p>She walked falteringly, sometimes quickening, sometimes checking her steps,
                        like one who was not quite sure whether she was or was not right in keeping
                        an appointment rather mysterious for our day.</p>
                     <p>She went into the square at the stated gate. Jake passed her and took a seat
                        on a bench a little way off. She, never noticing him, looked all around and
                        finally went to a seat herself.</p>
                     <p>A man who had been discoursing on what damage the thaw was doing on the dead
                        grass plots and empty flower-beds, with the park keeper, slowly left him and
                        went over to Gypsy.</p>
                     <p>The day was bright, and rather warm than wintry. So many young ladies were
                        strolling about the enclosure and tossing their aristocratic heads on
                        passing the children of the Twentieth street gas-house laborers (plebeian
                        intruders), that Gypsy might well seem only one of their number.</p>
                     <p>However, the man stopped before her, bowed and took a seat on the bench
                        beside her.</p>
                     <p>He was a man of loose frame, not tall, but seemingly capable of drawing
                        himself up to a greater height. He was rather fleshy. His complexion was a
                        purple, and his long whiskers were a fiery red. He looked like a German
                        grocery-keeper who had made more money than he knew well what to do with,
                        and in a shorter time than he dreamt of on leaving the vaterland.</p>
                     <p>Hall scanned him narrowly. "You're easily known again," he thought. "I could
                        follow such a lager-keg as you through Bushwick Swamp. I'll know all about
                        you soon, to-night, or I'm much out."</p>
                     <p>There was no chance of his hearing what the stranger said to Miss Raymond.
                        If he tried to get any nearer them, he ran the risk of the birds rising
                        altogether. All he could do was to try to make out by the play of their
                        features what they were talking about.</p>
                     <p>At first, when the stout man had sat down beside her, Gypsy had evinced so
                        much surprise that it was clear that she saw him for the first time. When,
                        after being seated, he had spoken a few words, she had half risen, with a
                        start of alarm, as if she was going to run away. A look was enough to
                        tranquilize her. Then, as the German spoke, Gypsy's bearing betrayed
                        considerable apprehension. She shook her head, but she seemed at length to
                        yield to some sound reasoning. One time she appeared ready to weep, for she
                        lowered her vail; but, almost instantly, she smiled. At the end, she gave
                        ger hand, as if making a promise.</p>
                     <p>Now, what, on earth, could all this mean? Hall, writhing on his bench, would
                        have given anybody board and lodging free for a year who could have told
                        him.</p>
                     <p>"I'll write to old David Valentine to get him to make the council put the
                        park benches <emph>closeter</emph> to one another! What a soft-shell I am to
                        be so fur off!"</p>
                     <p>The German just then rose, offered his arm to Gypsy, who took it without
                        more ado, accustomed as she was to hanging on gentlemen's arms, and together
                        they made for the eastern gate.</p>
                     <p>They seemed so deep in conversation that Hall saw no inconvenience in
                        keeping near them. On reaching the street where the cars were going down to
                        First avenue, they stopped, no doubt, to wait for one. But there was some
                        delay in their coming. It was just that hour when the most of the cars have
                        been hurried down town empty, to take the swarm of down-town working-bees
                        home to hive.</p>
                     <p>In disgust at waiting, the German hailed a lumbering back.</p>
                     <p>"Good!" thought Jacob, "they're getting in! Now I'll nail 'em!"</p>
                     <p>It was twilight, and darkness soon overclouds New York when the sun has once
                        crossed the Hudson and stared at Newark Bay.</p>
                     <p>While the was door banged to and the driver gathered up the reins, Jacob
                        coolly crept up behind the vehicle and perched himself on the foot-board.
                        Luckily its spikes had been rendered pointless by boys interested in their
                        being inoccuous pounding them with paving-stones. By sitting a good deal on
                        one side, and doubling the skirt of his overcoat under him, Jacob could grin
                        and bear it. The hack went straight down Avenue A to Houston street, which
                        it took to go up<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC8328-00000015"/> to Broadway. With
                        the dusk the air had turned chilly again, in the usual style—freeze by
                        night, thaw by day—of the degenerate Winters since 1820.</p>
                     <p>The wheels went around rapidly, but Jacob was not called Coon for nothing.
                        He held on, like his unhuman namesake to a gum-tree, and likewise held—his
                        breath.</p>
                     <p>However, though the Russ pavement which was being laid as an experiment on
                        part of Avenue A was respectable, the cobble-stones in Houston street began
                        to shake the spy, and he felt a pain in the region of the heart, when the
                        back was pulled up before the drinking-place on the Crosby-street
                        corner.</p>
                     <p>Hall rolled off, stiff with the splashes of slush having frozen on him, and
                        unnerved by the shaking. He ran across the way, and stood behind the
                        groceryman's charcoal-box. There he waited. The driver got down, and his
                        white coat vanished within the saloon, whence the fumes of Tom-and-Jerries
                        were alluringly circling.</p>
                     <p>Two, three, five minutes passed.</p>
                     <p>"That's a comic place for them to go to sleep in!" thought Mr. Hall.</p>
                     <p>No appearance of the driver.</p>
                     <p>Jake looked up and down the street. He had it all to himself, except a
                        parcel of young men waiting at Laura Keene's stage-door for the
                        ballet-girls.</p>
                     <p>Hall crossed over to the coach, and most carefully raised himself on tiptoe
                        to pry into it.</p>
                     <p>Oh, deception! it was empty!</p>
                     <p>If Manhattan Eight had directed a stream from its new double-decker on the
                        detective he couldn't have felt more like a drowned rat, slung across a
                        clothes-line by its tail to dry. The motionless attitude he struck would
                        have been a model for Mrs. Lot of salty renown. When he did recover he
                        ripped out a pair of oaths which made the gas tremble in the corner
                        lamps.</p>
                     <p>"Burn me, hoof and hide!" he roared, "sold, done, euchred, deadest kind of
                        broke, loto'd, loo'd, bluffed, cut up! By jinks, somebody's got to pay for
                        this!"</p>
                     <p>In a moment his wits ran over the gaunt of probable and improbable
                        eventualities.</p>
                     <p>"It's clear,' mused he, "that the Dutchman and Gypsy walked in by one door
                        and out by the other. But did they do it before this blasted old machine
                        started, or just now when it pulled up? It went <emph>light,</emph> and I
                        didn't hear them talk. Well, I swear! I'd give Squire Snediker title deeds
                        to all Long Island, if 'twas mine, to cop this lager youth! What can I make
                        out of it? If they've tricked me it's because they were afraid of being
                        followed, and that shows an uneasy conscience, I guess."</p>
                     <p>He examined the coach.</p>
                     <p>"Hang me if the number's on! I'd 'a' warmed him for having no lamps lit
                        after dark! He went into the saloon to see the coachman. But while
                        devastating the contents of a hot gin and tansy (the spoon being carefully
                        removed from him by the suspicious bartender on account of his roll-in-the
                        street looks), he came to the conclusion that the driver was not only a big
                        man with a heavy whip but in a bad humor. So he deemed it most prudent to
                        pull up stakes without-prosecuting any inquiries.</p>
                     <p>"Is he 'in' the plant, I wonder?" pondered Jake, as he turned homeward.</p>
                     <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
                     <p>Very dolefully did he enter the Pear Tree House as eleven struck.</p>
                     <p>"Is the little jade home?" was the first thing he asked.</p>
                     <p>"No; but two big parcels have come here for her."</p>
                     <p>Coon pounced on the brown paper bundles, lifted them upon the office sofa
                        and coolly undid them. There were three cheap calico dresses, petticoats to
                        match, and a straw bonnet.</p>
                     <p>"Jerusalem!" broke forth the detective, in vexation, "here she is going to
                        disguise herself now! What next? What next? That's all I want to know."</p>
                     <p>When he had so dismally returned, Jacob had not certainly meant to acquaint
                        his wife with his failure, but this new fact put his conjectures to rout,
                        and consideration of self-esteem galloped off in no order to meet the enemy.
                        He confessed all up and down; his nearly-realized hopes, his incredible
                        misadventure, his suspicions! And for a long while the two laid their heads
                        together to study the business on every side, and quarry out some plausible
                        vein of explanation. They at last decided to stay up for Gypsy, whom Mrs.
                        Margetoon might gains me intelligence from. But she only came in at one
                        o'clock, long after the couple had begun to say, "She's gone for good!"</p>
                     <p>When the bell rang, Coon ran into the pantry, while his help-mate went down
                        stairs to let Gypsy in and bring her up into the office. She made her sit
                        down.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! here you are at last, my dear!" she cried. "I'm getting quite to feel
                        for you! I've been so worried about you, you can't think! Oh! what a state
                        of fidgets you've put me in!"</p>
                     <p>"I'm much obliged," said Miss Raymond, smiling; "but I am used to taking
                        care of myself. But has a boy brought some packages for me?"</p>
                     <p>She had gone out a very different being from the Gypsy who returned. She was
                        quite sorrowful, but not more cast down. A close approach to a generous and
                        noble resolve was revealed in her eyes and by her manner.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, yes; they've come—there they are? Going to fit up your room? And have
                        you seen your friend's friend?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh, yes; and his advice has altered all my plans. After the examination
                        to-morrow. I won't be coming back here. If you'll please make out my bill so
                        that I can settle in the morning on going."</p>
                     <p>"Going! Oh what has happened?" inquired Mrs. Margetson, a little too
                        eagerly.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, nothing," answered Gypsy, who knew a thing or two, if not three;
                        "nothing that can concern strangers."</p>
                     <p>She lit her end of the candle at the gas, and retired with a significant
                        "good night!"</p>
                     <p>"What's your opinion now?" said Jacob, coming out of his lair.</p>
                     <p>"It floors me!" said the giantess. "She writes to a man for him to call here
                        to-morrow, and off she goes without seeing him."</p>
                     <p>"She's been set against us. She knows me!"</p>
                     <p>"This friend of the cashier has done it.'</p>
                     <p>"Not so sure. I begin to believe that the real robbers are old hands.
                        They've seen me at work, and want to put me off; but I've been at Chatham
                        Four Corners before this, and took the right road, my beauties. If I hear
                        to-morrow that this little sinner has the rocks, and walks off with 'em, I
                        shan't be an ounce surprised!"</p>
                     <p>"Guess not!" said Mrs. Margetron, shaking her head; "I go back to what I
                        said before. Go you and sound Mr. Newlife."</p>
                     <p>"Well, I will," replied Jacob, after a moment's thought; "but only to have
                        my mind easy. He's only been half as many months on the force as I have
                        years. When I have seen nothing, his eyes won't tire with sights. For all
                        his <emph>four</emph> eyes, he can't scare me."</p>
                     <p>Nevertheless, the speaker slept very little the rest of the night, more
                        intent on the Broadway Bank Robbery than a dramatist on a new sensation.</p>

                     <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
                     <head type="sub">COON FINDS HIS COLONEL SCOTT AND COMES DOWN AT THE FIRST
                        SHOT—SUSPICIOUS CENTER.</head>
                     <p>At half-past five Jacob Hall was up. He bolted a hot roll fresh baked and a
                        cup of coffee, and thus fortified, he took the Third Avenue cars as far down
                        as Spring street. Thence he crossed Broadway and stopped at a very
                        respectable-looking house in Prince street, just beyond Woos'er, it was one
                        of the block of dwellings quite fashionable twenty years or rather more
                        ago.</p>
                     <p>Jacob's impudence began to ooze out of his cold finger-tips at the rate of
                        Bob Acre's courage, and his hat, at first cocked on one side, straightened
                        up when he had fully reached the door. There lived Mr. Newlife, though his
                        name was not on the panel. An old couple had the first floor and basement,
                        and he had all the rest of the five story and attic building to himself.</p>
                     <p>The moment Hall gave his name, which he was somewhat surprised to do, to the
                        servant, who was actually up, he was staggered by her reply:</p>
                     <p>"Sure you kin walk up at wanst, for Mr. Newloife he's awaitin' for ye!"</p>
                     <p>This information gave the little detective a great desire to beat a retreat.
                        Why, how did he come to be expected? While he halted, the servant closed the
                        door with the remark that it was "could agin this mornin'," and he had to
                        proceed up stairs. As he often called he knew the way, and yet his feet
                        dragged on the stairs.</p>
                     <p>He plucked up courage, and opened a door on first landing.</p>
                     <p>In the middle of the large front room, so quaintly furnished that it looked
                        like an actor's dressing-room, and half like a newspaper editor's sanctum,
                        seated at a long table, Mr. Newlife was writing by the aid of his
                        everlasting spectacles.</p>
                     <p>It was well known that the detective had some other pursuit in band than
                        mere thief-taking, but what this writing and drawing and amateur
                        blacksmithing and carpentering was about, had never been explained.</p>
                     <p>Upon the entrance of Mr. Hall, who came forward very respectfully with a
                        bend in his back, Newlife lifted his head, stuck his pen in the ink-bottle,
                        and hailed him thus:</p>
                     <p>"Oh, so you're here at last, my boy! Well, has the Broadway Bank robbery
                        stuck in the grooves, jammed tight?"</p>
                     <p>"Eh! do you know," began Jake, with a stutter that would have made his
                        fortune in Lord Dundreary.</p>
                     <p>"I know that you're over head and ears in a muss, and you've so snarled the
                        skein that you'll never lay hold of either end."</p>
                     <p>"Me! me! what have I got to do——?"</p>
                     <p>Newlife rose and paced the room once or twice before he turned on the last
                        speaker.</p>
                     <p>"I'd like to have your judgment, Mister Coon Hall," he said, in a stern,
                        ironical voice—"your candid judgment on the man who gets paid to do certain
                        things, but goes on his own hook in the trade? This man not only lets out
                        just a little of his knowledge to switch the other cars off the track, but
                        he puts all the wood and water into his own tender, and runs on for his own
                        foolish vanity, quite careless that a poor prisoner is languishing in one
                        depot, while the genuine scamps are having a high old time with the plunder
                        in another spot."</p>
                     <p>Hall had taken a chair to sit down, but he remained standing,
                        spell-bound.</p>
                     <p>"I see you think such a man ought to be kicked out ot the line, with no
                        character, at the very least. There's a good many folks that sneer at
                        police, just as if we lose any time in staring at honest people who behave
                        themselves as such. The less a profession is honored, the more honorable its
                        craftsmen ought to be! But you've sold it up! So Mister Coon's ambitious,
                        and wants to put some fancy licks, some French flourishes, on the police
                        books. You're a pretty American! Ain't your eyes open to it, that we're the
                        first in every born thing, from villainy up to detection? The French secret
                        agents are too snowy, and the English Scotland-Yarders too slow. We New
                        Yorkers just hit off the exact medium! We can chase the fellow as unknownly
                        as the Parisians, and we can come down on him steady and firm as any
                        Londoner in 'plain clothes or the blue.' But you go in for some new moves.
                        You say, 'Let my mates try their own fangles; I'll play with cards of my own
                        printing.' Let me tell you, Mr. Hall, it takes an uncommon man, one trained
                        by long sleepless nights spent in endless calculations and fresh
                        combinations, and by travel, so as to ring with all manner of men and women,
                        to go all alone after outlaws. Now, you've hardly been outside of the
                        island, save on business. You wasn't handsome enough in your youth to taste
                        of creole, nigger, English, Irish, Swedish, Indian beauties—and so you don't
                        know <emph>women</emph> much! and women-knowledge is only to be got by
                        unpublished books. Some of us read a many before we come to the end of the
                        lessons!"</p>
                     <p>Here Hall could have sworn that his superior sighed.</p>
                     <p>Yet it was in a totally unshaken voice that he went on, piercing him through
                        and through with his undimned glance, spite of the spectacles.</p>
                     <p>"Don't you speak! I can prove all you've been at, as it is my duty to do!
                        This comes under the head of malfeasance of justice, and if the culprits are
                        lost through you, it's a State Prison offence, I've a notion. While the
                        cashier—what's his name—is being examined, you fall to examining the banker
                        Van Kieft, by means of his servants. Jerry's green at the ivory balls, and
                        you're showing him how red and white kiss, eh?"</p>
                     <p>Was Newlife really in anger? Hall knew him pretty well, and suspected he
                        was, and yet the chief detective was such a queer fish that he could not be
                        sure even of that little.</p>
                     <p>"If you'd only been smart," proceeded Newlife, "it wouldn't have mattered.
                        You've tried to do wonders, and you've only made a mull of it!"</p>
                     <p>"That's a fact!" said Hall, groaning, without dreaming of it. "But who on
                        earth could work up a case like this, where there ain't a peg to hang a
                        cobweb thread on—not a trace, not a mark, not a scratch!"</p>
                     <p>"Hold bard!" sneered the other. "Let me tell you that the day when we were
                        called in to set to work, you had most likely—I don't say certainly—most
                        likely, in your pair of clumey paws, the way to find out which of the two
                        keys, the banker's or the cashier's, had been used in the robbery."</p>
                     <p>"The deuce I had!"</p>
                     <p>"You don't believe anything! <emph>That's</emph> jus't where you fail. The
                        man who's bound to win, know's <emph>when</emph> to believe! That's for your
                        pipe when you smoke next. But, say; don't you remember the scratch you found
                        out on the steel safe? You were so affected by it that you uttered an O! as
                        large around as a hundred-horse-power fly-wheel. You examined it with the
                        magnifier and made sure that it was quite fresh. You said carefully that it
                        was done at the time of the robbery."</p>
                     <p>"No doubt," chimed in Hall, as lugubriously as a cracked bell.</p>
                     <p>"But what was it done with? With a key; for a pick lock or a steel point
                        wouldn't plow up paint that way. So the keys ought to have been demanded
                        from the banker and his cashier. One of them would have, scooped up into its
                        barrel, some atoms of the varnish, I'll go bail!"</p>
                     <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC8328-00000016"/>
                     <p>Hall listened with gaping mouth. At the end he smote his forehead and cried
                        violently:</p>
                     <p>"Ain't I a thundering tool!"</p>
                     <p>"There it is," caught up Mr. Newlife; "a fool. What! such an index jumped
                        out under your eyes and you never laid a red cent on it to turn up that
                        color! That is the only and the true starting-point of the whole case. If I
                        find the guilty man, it will be because of that scratch, and I'm going to
                        find him, my boy!"</p>
                     <p>When aloof, Mr. Hall readily ran down his mate, his superior, and boldly
                        braved him; but when he came beside him, he instinctively submitted to the
                        influence which Newlife exerted when he cho-e. All of Jacob's projects were
                        upset. Where and how had Newlife picked up so much of value?</p>
                     <p>"I thought you'd left the case alone after we had secured the cashier," said
                        Hall. "Have you been <emph>long</emph> on it?"</p>
                     <p>"Some time," answered Newlife, vaguely, as he quietly resumed his seat. "But
                           <emph>I</emph> don't set myself up as infall ble. I may have skipped some
                        precious point. Sit down, sit down, and let's hear all you have done."</p>
                     <p>Hall made a clean breast of his goings-on, except, when he got to the end of
                        his story, he felt a vain remorse, and stopped before the trick of the
                        German and Gipsy on him.</p>
                     <p>"You're forgetting some of it," said Newlife. "How about the broken-down
                        hod-carrier, who cut behind an <emph>empty</emph> back?"</p>
                     <p>Spite of his impudence, Jacob reddened to the ear tips, and hung his head
                        like a boarding-school m ss caught tossing love letters over the fence to
                        Dr. Birch's boy's.</p>
                     <p>"You know that too?" he gasped. "However could you——"</p>
                     <p>But an idea flashed on him. He stopped short, sprang to his feet and
                        cried:</p>
                     <p>"Oh! I got it! The red-whiskered Dutchman, was you! Mr. Newlife!"</p>
                     <p>His huge surprise impressed his face with so out-of-the way an expression,
                        that Newlife could not help laughing.</p>
                     <p>"So, it <emph>was</emph> you!" said the wonder thrilled detective; "you were
                        the fat fellow I took particular note of, and yet I didn't know you! Oh, Mr.
                        Newlife, Ned Forrest will never more 'come when he is sent for,' if you go
                        on the stage! What a make-up! And I, too, was disguised!"</p>
                     <p>"And badly, my poor boy! that justice must be accorded you. Do you think
                        that a man can't know a fellow again because he glues on a beard and changes
                        his coat? How about the eye, Jacob! The eye, Jake! You must alter the eyes!
                        That's <emph>the</emph> secret! if you want to go teach your granny to suck
                        eggs without her knowing you from Adam!"</p>
                     <p>This theory of the importance of the gaze in regard to travesty, explained
                        why Mr. Newlife (who could trace the red ink on the back of altered bank
                        bills after chlorine gas had taken all the hue out, to others' glance) had
                        never been seen without his gold-bowed spectacles.</p>
                     <p>"But, Mr. Newlife," said Jacob, running on in the old groove; "you have
                        pumped the fancy piece—my wife couldn't sound her? Do you know why she
                        leaved us to-mor—I mean to-day: why she don't stay to meet Mr. Clanmoran;
                        why she's been buying Bowery dresses?"</p>
                     <p>"I ought to. I told her to do all this."</p>
                     <p>"In that case," said Hall, kicking his hat to the other side of the room, to
                        have his spite out of something, "I knock under. I'm more of a fool than I
                        ever imagined." "No. Cooney!" said Mr. Newlife, mildly, "you ain't a fool.
                        You have only made the mistake of taking too much on your shoulders. You're
                        equal to a gonoff, and an average murderer, and even a gray-headed burglar
                        at a pinch, but you can't come the finessing. I dare say you never heard of
                        a celebrated detective, of olden times, of the name of Dogberry. The beauty
                        of him was, that even his blundering led to a discovery of vital moment.
                        Some people laugh at him. Anyhow, he wisely remarked to his mate, Verges,
                        that, when two men ride a horse, one must ride behind."</p>
                     <p>"Very true," said Hall, humbly; "no other way."</p>
                     <p>"Not so sure. In the modern circuses, you can see two men ride on a horse
                        with both on a level on the pad. But the rule holds. Some of these days,
                        I'll leave the force, Jacob. If you will have learnt by that time," said
                        Newlife, gravely, "that a police officer has as sacred and weighty a duty in
                        God's eyes, as in man's, as the judge himself—my good word's promised to you
                        keep you in to the lead. But, now, be the captain, to my colonelship. I
                        don't talk loud of myself; but, granting all men free and equal, I've had
                        chances you never had. You're a mason, Hall. And you thought I wasn't in
                        that, because I didn't let on, first time we met, that I understood or even
                        noticed your test words? I'm better than that, my boy!"</p>
                     <p>If Newlife had gone on to say that he was Gabriel or Raphael, and had
                        incontinently whipped out the trumpet or the flaming sword. Jacob would have
                        calmly knelt and let him deal the blow.</p>
                     <p>"As I say, you've taken too much on your shoulders, for its too hefty a'most
                        for <emph>me!</emph> Have you made any headway at all since you went into
                        this business? Not five foot! You're a capital hand under a better leader,
                        but you have'nt had schooling enough to be a general. I'll read you a line
                        worth treasuring.</p>
                     <p>He took a book off a pile of others, found a place by a mark in it, and
                        read:</p>
                     <p>"'The star of the second magnitude is eclipsed by those in the first.'"</p>
                     <p>Never had Jacob known his principal to be so preaching and so kindly. On
                        being unmasked, he had expected a prairie storm that would lay him flat as a
                        sheeps' head, and, quite otherwise, he was quits with a shower that hardly
                        bedewed his face. Newlife's choler had scattered like the huge heaps of
                        black clouds that mass themselves of a Summer night, shine with
                        sheet-lightning once or twice, and "fold up, their tents like the Arabs, and
                        as silently steal away."</p>
                     <p>For all this, notwithstanding, Mrs. Margetson's husband was not at ease; he
                        was pondering whether such surprising affability did not gloss over some
                        vast terror.</p>
                     <p>"So you know who did the crime, Mr. New life," he said.</p>
                     <p>"No more than you do, Jake; and, fact is, while you have your opinion
                        full-rigged. I haven't a spar standing on my thoughts. You assert that the
                        cashier hadn't a finger in, and that the banker did have his whole hand, and
                        I cannot say whether you are wrong or right. I'm travelling behind you, my
                        boy, and you have seen more or the road. I am only certain of one thing;
                        that there was a scratch on the safe door. See here."</p>
                     <p>As he spoke he opened a portfolio leaning against the legs of the table, and
                        pulled out a sheet of pasteboard. Upon it was mounted a fine photograph of
                        Van Kieft's steel sate. As no gas burned in that room and no common light
                        was powerful enough, Newlife, always equal to the emergency, produced a few
                        inches of a thin tape of metal, and, by the flame it sent off in combustion,
                        the picture was taken. So without caring to carry his knowledge further, it
                        was thanks to Mr. Newlife that magnesium was first used in photography in
                        the United States.</p>
                     <p>Hence the print was beautifully colorless and clear. All the details were
                        reproduced with the utmost exactness, the five lettered knobs, the tiny
                        keyhole, and the scratch on the varnished surface standing out with
                        admirable sharpness.</p>
                     <p>"Now to the scratch," said the detective. It runs from right to left,
                        downwards, diagonally from the keyhole. Very deep, considering, at the
                        starting point, it tapers off into indistinctness."</p>
                     <p>Hall was hanging over the picture, his head close to other's.</p>
                     <p>"I see it."</p>
                     <p>"Naturally, you thought that it was made by the author of the theft. Let's
                        see if you are right. Here is a plate of steel, coated with the same
                        varnish, on the banker's sate. The men who made that safe use only the one
                        quality—the best—on polished facets; and I have had at dried at a heat that
                        renders this as hard as time made the other coat. Here's a bunch of keys.
                        Take this small one off the split-ring, and try you to scratch this
                        surface."</p>
                     <p>Without too plainly guessing what his superior was driving at, the detective
                        began to draw the stem of the key over the varnished plate.</p>
                     <p>"The deuce!" said he after a couple of at tempts; "it's as hard as the glaze
                        in a clam-shell."</p>
                     <p>"Very hard, you're right; and that on the steel safe may have a little
                        advantage from the long exposure to the air. Therefore, the scratch you
                        remarked could not have been made by the trembling band of a thief, missing
                        the lock in the dark."</p>
                     <p>"Skunked!" ejaculated Jacob; "I never could have approached to that. It is
                        sure that to plough up the paint so, the pressure must have been
                        strong."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, indeed. But why? I've been three days racking my brains over it, and I
                        could play chess, holding my own, with Prince Merza of Delhi. Last night I
                        found out the 'how.' Let us together try if my conjectures present enough
                        chances of probability to become the starting mark of my plan."</p>
                     <p>He had left the photograph in Jacob's hands, and had gone to the
                        room-door.</p>
                     <p>"This is panelled not unlike the safa," said he.</p>
                     <p>He took the key out of the lock and held it in his right hand.</p>
                     <p>"Come here, Hall, and stand on one side of me—on my right. The safe opens
                        like this door, from the left. Very well. Now, suppose that I wanted to open
                        this door with the key, and you didn't wish me to do it when I'd go to stick
                        the key in the hole, you'd——"</p>
                     <p>"Lay hold of your arm to pull it away or force it down!"</p>
                     <p>"Of course! There, let's do at once more."</p>
                     <p>Hall obeyed, and the key in Newlife's hand, prevented from entering the
                        lock, ran along, across and down the door face, leaving a trace of its
                        progress identical with the line upon the steel save in reality and in the
                        photograph.</p>
                     <p>"Whew—ew—ew!" whistled the sleeping partner of the Pear Tree House, dwelling
                        in contemplation over the sight.</p>
                     <p>"Do you begin to understand?" queried Mr. Newlife.</p>
                     <p>"Begin?" That's no word for it. A boy out of the public schools could see
                        into it now. Oh, what a man you are, Mr. Newlife! I see the scene as if I
                        had made one in it. When the money was taken two persons stood by the safe;
                        one was hungering for the plunder, the other had his reasons to fight shy,
                        and tried to keep him off. It is clear; it is sure!"</p>
                     <p>"There you go again," interposed the other, quietly. "You take a thing for
                        granted that is a mere chance, and only likely, at the best of it."</p>
                     <p>"Oh, no," persisted Jacob; "you're not the sort to go astray. Doubt is no
                        longer admitted."</p>
                     <p>"Well, what do you draw from our discovery?"</p>
                     <p>"First place it proves that I was not far out. The clerk, the cashier, is
                        innocent, because, free to open and shut the steel safe whenever he liked,
                        he would have kept witnesses free from his skirts."</p>
                     <p>"Well reasoned. But if that's so, the banker's clear. He is just the same.
                        Mind what you are about."</p>
                     <p>Hall reflected, and all his animation died out.</p>
                     <p>"It's true," said he in a hopeless way; "it's too true. What the mischief is
                        to be done?"</p>
                     <p>"Hunt up the thief, of course, the fellow who did open the safe and take the
                        money; he's laving off on some sofa with his coffee coming up to him this
                        hour—see, it's nine o'clock!"</p>
                     <p>He opened the curtains of one window, and let in the light and wheel-rattle
                        of the streets.</p>
                     <p>"But there's only the keys that Mr. Van Kieft and the cashier always carry
                        about with them."</p>
                     <p>"Not always—the banker says he left his key home, locked up."</p>
                     <p>"But the key won't do—the word's wanted."</p>
                     <p>"What was the word?" said Newlife, impatiently.</p>
                     <p>"Gipsy."</p>
                     <p>"The cashier's girl's name. Well, now set to work, my boy. That day when you
                        find a man who knows enough of Prosper Roadside to give a guess at the word
                        uppermost in his head, and familiar enough with Van Kieft to steal into his
                        bedroom, you can arrest the right man. The present prisoner has got to be
                        let go, you'll see."</p>

                        FREE—HOME TWICE—THE OLD MAN'S BEST FRIEND—THE GAY BOY'S PAL.</head>
                     <p>Already the Broadway Bank robbery had lost interest. The papers only gave a
                        meager half-dozen lines to the announcement that the cashier was to be
                        brought up under remand this day.</p>
                     <p>Many of Mr. Van Kieft's friends, men of his own age and position, came with
                        him, however, as if to show that they esteemed him too highly not to be
                        desirous of seeing the proper person—that is, the cashier—punished for a
                        crime which had plashed some stain upon the banker.</p>
                     <p>Except Miss Raymond and Col. Haviland, there could hardly be said to have
                        been one who knew Roadside present.</p>
                     <p>Prosper's father had gone home the previous day, assured that his son was
                        not going to be hardly used, by one who could foresee.</p>
                     <p>During the preliminary cases, Mr. Newlife, very quiet in the gloom of the
                        court, took Jake Hall's arm, and walked him outside into the busiest part of
                        the entrance, where they could talk most unobserved. Newlife had learned
                        long ago, that the most crowded place is the loneliest.</p>
                     <p>"Jake," said he curtly, "I've made up my mind. I hear Col. Haviland is going
                        to stay in town, and has apartments engaged at the Prescott House. He's
                        going to set up a carriage of his own since the new park is getting in
                        vogue. He's left word for a servant at an intelligence office on Fourth
                        avenue, and Charley, luckily, accidentally told me. He'll get you the
                        place——"</p>
                     <p>"Col. Haviland! Why, he's a friend of the cashier's."</p>
                     <p>"Never said he was. Don't you interrupt." said Newlife sharply.</p>
                     <p>"Do what I tell you, and never fret about the rest," pursued the detective.
                        "It's true the Colonel's no friend of Roadside's, but he's the 'banker' of
                        Burnett Clanmoran. How's that? They're a colt and an old roadster, and make
                        no span naturally. We must find out what puts them in pair-barness. Yes, and
                        why this manager of an iron-foundry makes it his business to quit Shiner's
                        Bay, come to that Dey street hotel, and now to Captain Degroot's. A man who
                        hangs out in a first-class hotel where there's so<pb n="32-33"

                        means, I'll have on eve an his life. You know how to drive——"</p>
                     <p>"From a pair of Shetlands to Albany Bill's Seventh avenue stage-sleigh with
                        the six-and-thirty horses!" said Jake loftily. "I'm Jack-of-all-Trades."</p>
                     <p>"Well, drive him, and get him down in the books. Now, mind you, I've been
                        spotting him, and he's 'close-shaved'—he don't leave his history around on
                        the parlor-tables. Just you look out for yourself. Serve him well, but don't
                        be too good. Don't be too honest, especially!"</p>
                     <p>"All correct!"</p>
                     <p>"I'll see you every day, if I don't have to leave town. Until a new order,
                        don't you come to court, to the Hall, or to my house. You might be dogged.
                        Drop a line to your wife, if there's any very 'sudden complaint.' Go now to
                        Oyster Bay on Broadway, and the nigger'll give you a packet he's keeping for
                        you. It's got your new name and recommendations in it."</p>
                     <p>Jake winked, and strolled toward Broadway, while Newlife returned to the
                        court-room.</p>
                     <p>He had caught Justice Kogan the moment he came down to his duties and
                        explained the scratch on the steel safe and other matters to him. Therefore,
                        he was one of the least surprised, when a few fresh witnesses having
                        attested Roadside's general fame for good behavior, the justice decreed that
                        the evidence was vague as against the prisoner, that no jury would convict,
                        and that he had no hesitation in stating that, in the absence of more
                        incriminating proof, he must discharge the prisoner.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon Mr. Emery rose and firing off one blank signal-gun of "your honor"
                        to blind the savageness of his assault, touched off the cannon all down the
                        line of "trumpery case;" "no evidence indeed;" somebody who was loudest in
                        cries for justice, was more probably fitted to stand in this worthy but
                        cruelly ill-used youth's place," and concluded by one salvo that the
                        justice's words were to the effect that the prisoner quitted the court
                        without a stain of a pin's-head breadth upon him, and by another of the
                        heaviest pieces, that "his client would undoubtedly next appear as
                        prosecutor in a higher court in an action for damages!"</p>
                     <p>The portly moneyed men retired with Mr. Van Kieft, full of determination
                        that a citizens' association must be had to remove the paid magistrates who
                        would not convict every man who did not trade for himself and on half a
                        million of capital.</p>
                     <p>Gipsy had fainted with joy. Colonel Haviland was stopped at the door by
                        Newlife, who politely lit his cigar by the match he had just struck for his
                        own.</p>
                     <p>And Prosper, in a bewildered state, shook hands with half a dozen men whom
                        he hardly saw clearly before he returned to Ludlow street to get the
                        articles restored to him that had been taken from him on lodgment there.</p>
                     <p>Then, he stepped from the door and, all alone and feeling very lonely,
                        walked down the Bowery. He was free, and yet all doors were closed against
                        him still. Such an acquittal was a mere "not proven."</p>
                     <p>Public opinion has more terrors than dungeons.</p>
                     <p>Dreamily he went across Chatham square, and so up to the Park. A crowd was
                        before the DAILY NEWS bulletin-board. He heard his name. Some one had read
                        it aloud. "Gross Perversion of Justice! The Great Broadway Bank Robbery!!
                        The Cashier Released!!! See our 3 O'clock Edition!!!!"</p>
                     <p>Prosper turned away sick at heart. The bystanders seemed to know who he
                        was.</p>
                     <p>One of the police whom he had seen at the Hall the day of his trial, was
                        crossing over to Mat. Gooderson's. Roadside, for fear he would be
                        recognized, turned sharply, retraced his steps, and took William street on
                        his way down town. But, when he had got to Fulton, he stopped, leaned
                        against No. 5's long ladder hooked on the railings, and pondered in the
                        shadow of the church.</p>
                     <p>It was nearly dinner hour and, if he went on, he would have to pass through
                        the Wall street region, where nearly every other man and boy knew him by
                        sight. He shrank from such an ordeal. He turned down Fulton and went on
                        board the boat. He could reach his Brooklyn residence equally by this way,
                        but he had usually gone by the Atlantic street ferry.</p>
                     <p>The air in the cabin seemed oppressive. He stood outside, in the center, by
                        the rudder-pin plate, and looked down at the water, flecked with a scum, and
                        so rapidly rushing towards the restless wheels as to make a thoughtless man
                        giddy.</p>
                     <p>One step!</p>
                     <p>One forward step and the froth of the wake would hardly show by a touch of
                        red that the revolving float had beaten the life out of his body.</p>
                     <p>"No, no!" muttered he, drawing back and clutching the long middle chain, "I
                        must not be the cause of my own death. No! I won't die before I stand with
                        unblushing face in the midst of them all again!"</p>
                     <p>Now he was free, but only at present did he see the immense hardship in his
                        task. In each crime the law beholds a criminal, and Prosper could only make
                        his innocence manifest by finding and delivering the guilty up!</p>
                     <p>Despairing but not disheartened, he jumped into a hack, and was taken
                        quickly up the winding hill and along Myrtle avenue.</p>
                     <p>He did not know what impelled him, for he might just have well been driven
                        up to his own door as not, but he dismissed the coach-driver at the corner,
                        and walked up Claremont avenue to his dwelling.</p>
                     <p>He went slowly, with hanging head, returning none of the looks of the
                        nurserymaids airing their curiously becapped and begowned charges in the
                        gardens edging the sidewalks.</p>
                     <p>He was on the point of experiencing how, as he approached, faces would grow
                        chilly and conversation cease. He suffered all the timidity of an honest man
                        under the stigma; he wished to never more meet a face he knew.</p>
                     <p>It was a large and fashionable boarding-house where he "bailed from," though
                        so much of his time was spent elsewhere.</p>
                     <p>The girl who opened the door to him, for he forgot to use his latch-key,
                        looked the picture of amazement. He said nothing to her, but walked into the
                        parlor. As he expected—the guests all being out to business—the landlady's
                        daughters were practicing on the unfortunate piano some piece warranted to
                        do execution among bachelor boarders.</p>
                     <p>He simply said that they need not disturb their mother (a ponderous woman,
                        whom the fatigue of managing the coffee-urn quite disabled for some hours
                        after breakfast, spite of the best French brandy), as he only wished to say
                        that he was clear of the case, and that he only called to beg them to pack
                        up his things to be sent for. As he always kept a quarter's in advance paid
                        up, he was not in debt, but anything to add to his bill would be paid by the
                        messenger when he came for his property.</p>
                     <p>No girl ever received the announcement of a "catch" escaping her without
                        such emotion as is permitted in this century, and landladies' grown-up
                        daughters are exceptionably impressible. Unhappily, Prosper had no eyes for
                        the double attempt of each of the girls to faint in the other's arms. The
                        "biddy" had been at the key-hole—not a doubt of it—for on Mr. Roadside
                        coming out to go, she "was so glad to hear that, of course, they couldn't do
                        anything to him!" He thanked her.</p>
                     <p>For the first time, with any vividness the image of Gipsy arose before him
                        as he glanced up at the dull sky. He had never loved her, he had often not
                        liked her; at times he had hated her when something of her old and base
                        career had appeared in her eyes or on her lips. But at this juncture, her
                        recollection was very meet. From what he had seen of her during the
                        examination. whatever had been betrayed previously, he felt that she loved
                        him and would not doubt him whatever he affirmed. She was rather the girl to
                        be a little proud of him for being a Manfred of bank-robbers. Some girls are
                        such puzzlers, too, by clinging to a man better when he's down on his luck
                        than when fortune smiled most brightly upon him.</p>
                     <p>With a quicker step, he gained the Atlantic avenue, rode to the ferry,
                        crossed, and took stage at once to Rochambeau place.</p>
                     <p>What might not have happened since his removal? What not transpired while he
                        lost nearly a dozen days of life?</p>
                     <p>He had taken no note that Gipsy had changed her address, if indeed he had
                        heard that at all.</p>
                     <p>He remembered how pitifully she had gazed at him, just before, three hours
                        ago, she had dropped in a swoon on his being set at liberty.</p>
                     <p>He fully expected to find her in the house which he had taken for her.</p>
                     <p>The blinds were all closed, more so than every day. Still, he suspected no
                        change.</p>
                     <p>On seeing him, the servant who opened the door uttered a scream of
                        delight.</p>
                     <p>She was no prettier than the maids that "fancy women" care to have by them,
                        and Prosper had never been more gallant toward her than to give her a chuck
                        under the chin, or "That's for you, my dear!" with a five-dollar bill, when
                        he was throwing money around.</p>
                     <p>And yet she really was delighted.</p>
                     <p>"At last, here you are, sir," she exclaimed. "I always said you'd come out
                        white as snow. I just give a boy a quarter for a paper, though it had
                        nothing in it except the bare mention of your being let off!"</p>
                     <p>The woman's felicitations, sincere, if out of place, were painful to the
                        hearer, and he cut short all explanations with the inquiry:</p>
                     <p>"Where is Miss Raymond?"</p>
                     <p>"Gone—didn't you know?—long ago! You didn't? Oh, dear! Why, she went off in
                        a hurry the very day you were arrested. William's mother came and took him
                        away when it got into the papers, and cookey, she left with the coppers
                        that's missing, done up in her trunk, I'm sure; but I stayed to keep the
                        house till I saw you or some one."</p>
                     <p>"Gone! Gipsy gone!" the cashier repeated.</p>
                     <p>"Your father was here—very countryfied gentleman—very cross with me! He
                        asked me such a lot of questions; but I knew my place better than to tell
                        him how many nights you had champagne suppers!"</p>
                     <p>Here she giggled.</p>
                     <p>"He was here yesterday, and he spoke of a gentleman who would come here
                        to-day, and <emph>has</emph> come to-day, to wait to see you. I dare say you
                        know him. He's a taller gentleman than you, sir; rather stout, and has red
                        hair and whiskers!"</p>
                     <p>Roadside was as much astonished as it is possible to be. A friend of his, or
                        of his father's, in his "private" house—what could it mean? However, he let
                        none of his surprise be shown.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, yes. I know, I know," said he to get rid of the too loquacious
                        servant.</p>
                     <p>"He's in the missus' back parlor——"</p>
                     <p>Prosper pushed her aside and darted along the entry.</p>
                     <p>He must have been overheard, for the "friend" opened the sitting-room door
                        to him.</p>
                     <p>He was just such a man as the girl had sketched; rather stout, ruddy faced,
                        with a thick lip, very bright eyes and good-humored bearing. Rather
                        common-looking, with something of the air. In his unfashionable but
                        expensive black satin waistcoat, of some Missouri farmer who had found an
                        iron or lead mine on his land, and sold off at an advance of $30 a square
                        rood on his original purchase. Roadside had never seen him before.</p>
                     <p>"Happy to make your acquaintance, Mr. Roadside," said he.</p>
                     <p>He was quite at home. One arm of Gipsy's favorite lounging chair was
                        bestrode by a book, open in the middle, taken from a book-case, whose door
                        he coolly left open. A little more, and he would have been doing the honors
                        of the establishment.</p>
                     <p>"I must confess, sir," began the cashier, in no mood for jests——</p>
                     <p>"That you're surprised to see me? I believe you. Your father, an old friend
                        of mine—we were boys in Dr. Ogden's school in Albany, when Albany wasn't
                        more'n so big——meant to introduce me. But he went off home yesterday, pooty
                        sure you was going to come out o' the big end of the horn, and left me to
                        see you. I'd a' come to the court this mornin', but what was the use of
                        ann'ying you—seeing I'm jest of your father's opinion, that you never took a
                        V of Van Kiff's—what's his Dutch name?—Vander Kieftee's money."</p>
                     <p>Upon this news of good augury Prosper could not restrain an exclamation of
                        joy.</p>
                     <p>"So the old man left me a note for you," went on the stranger, "a sort of
                        introduction, you know—it'll do just as good as if he was here, I
                        reckon."</p>
                     <p>The cashier took the letter, opened the unsealed envelope, unfolded it, and
                        the blood began to rush into his cheeks as he progressed in its perusal.
                        When he had finished, he held out his hand to the stranger.</p>
                     <p>"I never even heard of you before," he said, "but my father calls you his
                        best friend."</p>
                     <p>"Used to go to Dr. Ogden's school——"</p>
                     <p>"So you said. Father bids me have all confidence in you and obey your
                        advice."</p>
                     <p>"That's the talk. Sit down, sit!" said he, plunging into the easy chair
                        himself. "It's somehow this here way: When your old man and me was young
                        men, about your age, more or less, we was precisely the best example of
                        partners that ever divided profits fair and square that's recorded in modern
                        history."</p>
                     <p>He tossed a quid out of the window into the conservatory, and sliced off a
                        bit to replace it, as he proceeded.</p>
                     <p>"I al'ays riggarded it as a misfortune to the country that your father went
                        into the canawl business. That always swamps an intellect! I went out West,
                        Mound City and Louisville contracts, various, and though I've kind o'
                        retired now, I'm as ready as the next man to cross the plains when a new
                        Californy volcanoes right out and shrieks for men to keep out foreign
                        elements."</p>
                     <p>A pause.</p>
                     <p>"I am!" concluded the tobacco-chewer, shutting his penknife with a snap.
                        "Well, as I was saying, your father's off his feet on account of you—natural
                        enough, and says he to me, Jehiel—that's me—Jehiel Sharpson—says he: 'Jehi.
                        my boy's off the tow-path, you're the man to wade in, swim if you must, and
                        bring him out.' To that I says: 'Prosper, if the canawl's the raging one of
                        the song, I'm thar all the same.' That's my style. Now then, the ice is
                        broke, as they say at surprise parties, what are you going to begin
                        with?"</p>
                     <p>This question kindled afresh all the cashier's wrath, for his eyes flashed
                        fire.</p>
                     <p>"Do!" he cried in a quivering voice, while his under lip shook. "Find out
                        the rascal who's<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC8328-00000018"/> got me a bad name,
                        shoot him, burn the hair off his head——"</p>
                     <p>"Lock him up will do better. Hair grows agin—sometimes after a scalp, I've
                        seen that! What's your means of finding the robbers?"</p>
                     <p>"None. And yet I will succeed, because any man who gives up his whole life
                        to a task, who wakes in the morning but to carry out his night's one
                        constant dream, is bound to make a good end of it."</p>
                     <p>"That's well said, friend Prosper, Junior, and, fact this is, I expected to
                        see you this same sort. The proof of it is that I have forestalled your
                        designs. I've drawed up the map, with the route down plain. To begin with,
                        I've talked to the owner of this ranche, and, seeing that the respectable
                        neighbors have begun to talk about the young lady you saw mighty often here,
                        he was rather joyful than otherwise to take back the lease. Then, I've seen
                        Burnham, up the avenue, and, though he might have drawed a bigger check,
                        this here furniture is sold, and you have nothing to do but disappear——"</p>
                     <p>"Disappear?"</p>
                     <p>"Ker-chunk! like the king of the bullies of the swamp-logs," said Mr.
                        Sharpson, illustratively dropping the straddling book off the chair arm and
                        under the seat.</p>
                     <p>"Disappear!" repeated the cashier, hurt; "why, anybody could stand up on the
                        Custom House steps and shout out, 'There, as I told you, he's off to have a
                        high time with the hundred thousand!'"</p>
                     <p>"Well, let him stand, let him shout!" said the Western man coolly. "You know
                        a blamed sight better than that; folks, you know, ain't talking as much now.
                        Suppose you was walking on a pier, and a <emph>passel</emph> of rowdies was
                        to jostle you over. Would you splutter and bubble up the water only to get a
                        brickbat or a kag of nails heaved over on you? Not if you know when you're
                        healthy. Why, you'd dive and sink under, smooth as the butter-rod into a
                        firkin, hold your breath and make for the nearest ship or the tother wharf.
                           <emph>Then</emph> you could run up to the street, raise your crowd, and
                        'lay' for them fellers at the head of the pier, I guess! <emph>I</emph> know
                        the city, you see! It's the moral of your situation. You've got some
                        enemies, ain't you? As long as you howl he'll know where you are, and can
                        dump a cart-load of pavers on you. Keep you quiet and he'll be his own
                        ruin!"</p>
                     <p>With a species of boyish submission Prosper listened to this man. He never
                        imagined that his father had a friend of this caliber; not only a
                        hard-headed trader, perhaps, but a city bred "liver." Without being well
                        aware of the fact, he yielded to the ascendancy of a temper several pegs
                        above his own. As everything had fallen away from him, he rejoiced to find
                        one support put in his hand.</p>
                     <p>"I will follow your counsel," responded Roadside, reflecting.</p>
                     <p>"I was sure of that, my boy. So, we'll vamose this day, and note that
                        selling off this fancy rubbish will come in handy. Have you any money? No.
                        You must have some, though. So I was right to show the lot to Johnson; he
                        takes it all as it stands, pictures excepted (they're a leetle warm for
                           <emph>public</emph> auction!) for two thousand three hundred and fifty
                        dollars—only that girl you've been keeping, sp'ilt the best carpets with
                        slinging ink and orange-peels, and lemon-pips around loose, it 'd been the
                        clear five hundred I'd 'a demanded, and got."</p>
                     <p>The cashier half rose.</p>
                     <p>"Yes," said Sharpson, remarking the start, "it's a good thing for him, but
                        the Nassaustreeters don't know me, and then agin, they'd want a week to
                        examine the stock."</p>
                     <p>"But I——,"</p>
                     <p>"Look here, my boy," said Sharpson in a tone which completely looked the
                        other's conversational wheels, "you're the patient, or impatient, it does'nt
                        amount to a row of pins, and I'm Dr. Squills. If you don't like the draught,
                        bolt it, and cry out as much as you like thereafter. The dose is patented to
                        do good; signature of the inventor on all the labels, none other
                        genuine."</p>
                     <p>"Go on, sir," said Prosper, giving way as before.</p>
                     <p>"Right. Let's be quick. You know Mr. Burnett Clanmoran?"</p>
                     <p>"Burnett's my first friend."</p>
                     <p>"Well, what's the fellow?"</p>
                     <p>"Fellow," repeated Roadside, in a vexed tone, "Mr. Clanmoran is Mrs. Van
                        Kieft's nephew. He is a young gentleman, very rich, very stylish, and the
                        best man I know."</p>
                     <p>"Do tell?" muttered Mr. Sharpson, turning his quid sailor-fashion, "this
                        human is created thick, with angelicious qualities—I'm glad, I am—like to
                        have his acquaintance. For you'd better know it, the moment I heard you were
                        acquitted, I sent a messenger, who was sure to find him, with a little
                           <emph>billy,</emph> which I wrote, for you, to fetch him here
                        to-day——"</p>
                     <p>"What?"</p>
                     <p>"To-day," looking at a large silver watch with a bullet-proof
                           <unclear>hunting</unclear>-case; "this hour, he'll be here, I guess."</p>
                     <p>"What," ejaculated the young man, in confusion, "do you suppose I'll
                        let——"</p>
                     <p>"There's no letting about it. This house is your landlord's—I'm 's free as
                        you, here! I had to see this moke. 'Moreover, besides,' as Henry Ward says,
                        I have a plan of conversation made up for you, and——"</p>
                     <p>The door-bell rang.</p>
                     <p>"Thunder!" said Sharpson, "here he is. My plan's squelched! I'll just step
                        out into this; all-windows flower-house, and you make him sit near the
                        window, eh?"</p>
                     <p>The bell rang again, while the servant was hurrying to answer.</p>
                     <p>Sharpson was standing on the French window's threshhold for a second.</p>
                     <p>"Prosper, on your life," said he, with an accent invented to infuse full
                        belief into the most rebellious mind, "on your life, not a word to this man
                        of me or your designs. For him, be weak, discouraged, dead beat——"</p>
                     <p>He disappeared in the little conservatory as Prosper rose to shake the new
                        comer's hand.</p>
                     <p>Burnett Clanmoran's portrait had not been "overcharged" with color by his
                        friend. Never had a better face been at the service of a noble
                        disposition.</p>
                     <p>Though twenty-four, Burnett looked under twenty. Of good stature, he was
                        well built. Light brown hair most abundantly curled around his intelligent
                        forehead. Frankness and pride shone in his large blue eyes.</p>
                     <p>He was just that sort of man who used to make the work-girls' hearts jump as
                        they ran the gauntlet of the New York Hotelites—<foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                           >stare super vias.</foreign>
                     </p>
                     <p>"My poor old boy!" said he, shaking the offered hand, "my poor old Prosper,
                        I was coming to see you anyhow, whether you'd written or not. How are you?
                        All hunk again, I suppose?"</p>
                     <p>Nevertheless, from beneath this affectionate demonstration pierced forth a
                        visible constraint, which, if it was unnoticed by the cashier, was carefully
                        remarked by Sharpson.</p>
                     <p>Prosper maneuvered and placed his visitor near the window.</p>
                     <p>"Your letter, old friend," pursued Burnett, taking the chair, "hit me hot. I
                        was frightened. I was afraid the joy of getting out of the scrape had driven
                        you mad. So I wrote Minniehaha that I couldn't drive her out up to the
                        Central, and hurried here."</p>
                     <p>Prosper seemed hardly to hear him, so abashed was he about the alarming note
                        written for him. What had it said? Who, then, was the man whose help he had
                        accepted?</p>
                     <p>"Are you cast down?" said Clanmoran. "Pooh! what's the use of despairing.
                        You're young enough to begin your life again, 'with improvements,' as they
                        say around here. You have friends yet. I've come here to say, 'you're right
                        in relying on me!' I have money enough to waste some on girls—it's ten times
                        more fit I should mount my friend on my horses when his has thrown him, than
                        that I should use up the nags for ponies for the sylphs of the street."</p>
                     <p>This generous offer, made at such a moment with the noblest simplicity,
                        deeply affected Roadside.</p>
                     <p>"Thank you, Burnett," he answered in a moved voice, "but all the money in
                        the world would be no use to me now."</p>
                     <p>"How so? What are you going to do? Try to get another place in the
                        city?"</p>
                     <p>"I don't know, my friend; I'm out of the way of thinking; I have no settled
                        plan."</p>
                     <p>"I have said it, in the words of—Byron, or one of the prophets, is it?
                        Anyhow, I have said it; you must begin life again. Excuse my going straight
                        as a cabbage tree—the palmetto stands for friendship, ever green, rare
                        fruit, and all that! So long as this mysterious robbery remains unexplained,
                        it is impossible for you to remain in New York."</p>
                     <p>"But it may never be unriddled——"</p>
                     <p>"The stronger the reasons for you to make your fortune elsewhere. Why, I was
                        talking about you to Colonel Haviland, when he came back to his hotel after
                        the discharge. By the way, you're unfair on Girard—he thinks a good deal of
                        you. 'In friend Roadside's place,' he said, 'I'd turn all that I had into
                        ready money, go to Frisco straight, and come back with my pile to settle
                        those who once suspected me.'"</p>
                     <p>This counsel stung the hearer. Yet he made no object on; the stranger's
                        words dwelling on his mind.</p>
                     <p>"Well?" queried Burnett.</p>
                     <p>"I'll think it over—I'll see about it," muttered the cashier. "I must know
                        what Mr. Van Kieft, first of all, says."</p>
                     <p>"My uncle? What a pity! You know that since I refused to drive a quill in
                        his bank he's been cold-shouldering me? It's all of a month since I've been
                        in his house. But I heard of him through your little friend; I mean young
                        Cragin. Since this affair, my uncle's gone on worse than you, it appears.
                        He's hardly ever seen down at the bank; he looks as if he had come out of
                        the hospital."</p>
                     <p>"And Mrs. Van Kieft, and—"</p>
                     <p>The cashier paused.</p>
                     <p>"And Miss Oestervelt?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh," answered Clanmoran, lightly, "my aunt; churchy—twice on Sunday aint
                        enough—she goes to prayer-meeting! honest truth! As for my pretty cousin,
                        she don't have time to read the papers between trying on dresses. Mr.
                        Lawrence Mather, the brother of the rich Boston Mather, is going to give the
                        largest size of masquerade ball ever known off the Academy stage. It's in
                        honor of his being made Minister to Sweden, instead of some poor devil of a
                        newspaper editor, who was let have two years of it to smooth the path of our
                        friend. Viandra only hit on her costume after a lot of attempts. The Mather
                        girls are going to be the Granite State and the Green Mountain ditto, and so
                        Viandra is standing up for New York—going to be in white and sea-green and
                        Hudson-River-by-Newburgh blue, with beaver-skin what-not as ornaments!
                        Tigar, Empire City!"</p>
                     <p>The excess of pain overpowers the mind and brings on a sort of
                        insensibility. Prosper had already writhed in pain, but this last brow all
                        but felled him.</p>
                     <p>"Viandia!" he murmured.</p>
                     <p>The other did not show that he overheard him, but he quietly rose.</p>
                     <p>"Well, I only called, you know! I suppose you have the lovely Gipsy to
                        console you! You needn't call her in to see me! I'm nobody. Oh, talking of
                        that ball, I'm a going—it's on Friday two weeks—Friday, unlucky, eh—for
                        somebody! I'll tell you how many waiters of ice-creams! Keep up your
                        spirits. Remember, come what may, you can depend on me."</p>
                     <p>For a last time, he shook Prosper's hand before he retired. He must have
                        been fairly in the street before the unfortunate cashier thought of moving
                        from the spot. To draw him from his gloomy meditation, came the mocking
                        voice of the red-whiskered man who had stepped in and stood by his side.</p>
                     <p>"That's one of your <emph>friends!</emph>" sneered he, falling back gingerly
                        into the easy-chair.</p>
                     <p>"Yes," sighed Prosper. "He offered me half his money——"</p>
                     <p>"The more fool he! You might have been the chap to take it," said Sharpson,
                        unfeelingly. "As it happens, he might have volunteered all, while he was
                        about it. Such offers don't bind! Notwithstanding what I say, though, I'll
                        lay two to one that he'd give a two-thou' draft on the Chemical to see the
                        plains and Old Rocky between you and him."</p>
                     <p>"He would? Why?"</p>
                     <p>"Can't tell. Perhaps for the very same reason that made him so carefully
                        draw your attention to the fact that he had not been to his uncle's for a
                        month."</p>
                     <p>"Why, that's so, I'm sure, sir."</p>
                     <p>"Naturally," observed Sharpson, slapping his sinister shoulder with his
                        dexter palm. "But enough of that, pooty boy," he went on seriously: "I have
                        his measure—all I want. Now, if you don't mind, we'll start down town to see
                        Mr. Van Kieft before he leaves the office. We can dine after."</p>
                     <p>The proposition seemed to pain Roadside.</p>
                     <p>"Never!" broke forth he, with extraordinary violence. "No, never! I'd like
                        to know what he thinks of me now, but I couldn't bear the sight of him!"</p>
                     <p>"I understand," said Mr. Sharpson, not at all surprised, "but I hope you'll
                        turn back on the trail, as the men of the mountain say, out Colorado-way. I
                        want to see Mr. Van Kieft just as bad as I did Mr. Clanmoran. And I
                        must—must, you mark? Are you so weak, you can't comb your dander down for
                        five minutes? I'll go along with you as your uncle or something; you won't
                        have to speak a word."</p>
                     <p>"If you say 'mus,' so be it," said Prosper.</p>
                     <p>"Good again. Come, jump up, and it won't be long before we're through it, as
                        the shoat said to his mate, when they slung them into the hot water trough.
                        Quick—run that brush over your hair. Ain't you got a—yes—here's some coats
                        in the bureau. Take this black one."</p>
                     <p>Roadside was mechanically changing his dress, when there was another ring at
                        the door.</p>
                     <p>"Eh?" cried Sharpson, surprised. "I didn't——who?"</p>
                     <p>He dashed out of the room.</p>
                     <p>"You needn't come up, Macy," he shouted down the kitchen stairs; "I'm going
                        to answer the door."</p>
                     <p>To his further surprise, clearly it was only a postman who had rung.</p>
                     <p>"Mr. P-r-o-s-Prosper Roadside," spelled the postman, as he held a letter
                        apart from the bunch.</p>
                     <p>"Yes."</p>
                     <p>"It's a day late—it was over to Brooklyn, but they said he—it ain't
                           <emph>you,</emph> is it?"</p>
                     <p>Sharpson smiled and shook his head.</p>
                     <p>"Said he was in jail, but his sort of wife (that's how the woman there put
                        it) kept house for him here."</p>
                     <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC8328-00000019"/>
                     <p>"Yes, it's all right."</p>
                     <p>"Sharpson took the letter.</p>
                     <p>"Hullo!"</p>
                     <p>"You may well 'hullo!' I've been ten years on the rounds, sir, and I never
                        saw such a letter before!"</p>
                     <p>The letter was singular, from the address upon it having been formed out of
                        printed letters, cut neatly from a book or newspaper.</p>
                     <p>The postman departed on his rounds, while Sharpson returned to the
                        cashier.</p>
                     <p>"It's a letter for you," said the stout man, but he coolly broke open the
                        envelope himself. A bank-bul escaped.</p>
                     <p>"A $500 on the Shoe and Leather," muttered Sharpson, picking it up and
                        laying it on the table.</p>
                     <p>Prosper purpled with shame.</p>
                     <p>"We'll see what it's all about," said the other, "for here's a note around
                        it."</p>
                     <p>The note was composed, like the address, of printed letters, and words cut
                        out and pasted on. It was brief but clear.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>"MY DEAR PROSPER: A friend who knows the pain of your situation, hastens
                           to your help. Learn that one heart shares your griefs. Go, leave the
                           country. You are young enough to begin again. May this mite be good luck
                           to you."</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>As the Western man read the above aloud, Roadside's anger increased. A
                        baseless rage, for he could not explain the succeeding events, and he felt
                        his reason totter.</p>
                     <p>"Good heaven!" he cried, "every body wants me to go—they're all in a plot
                        together!"</p>
                     <p>"At last, your eyes are open," said the other, smiling in satisfaction; "you
                        begin to understand past doubt, my boy, you are hated by some set for the
                        evil they have done you. There are folks in this town perpetually menaced by
                        your presence, and so they want to pack you off at any cost."</p>
                     <p>"Who are they? Who insults me by sending me my passage money?"</p>
                     <p>"If I knew, my dear boy," said old Mr. Roadside's friend, "I could make up
                        my hand, for then I'd know who broke your bank. But we'll scrootinize the
                        inner works. A little while ago, I didn't half know which screw to put the
                        driver to; know I've got a peg right under my hand. It was night before—the
                        gas is lit now. As the beautiful French say: 'Ve shall see vat ve shall see.
                        monjew!'"</p>
                     <p>He sat down, took out his note-book and glancing at the $500 bill, referred
                        to a page covered with names and figures.</p>
                     <p>"No," said he. when finished, "this bill didn't make one of the big
                        haul."</p>
                     <p>"You think so?"</p>
                     <p>"Think's too weak. The robbers didn't send this, unless they are a 'cuter
                        pack than I give them credit of bein'. I'm certain sure that this bill isn't
                        one of the innocents massacred in the steel-safe."</p>
                     <p>"Why, I——"</p>
                     <p>"What? Here's the number and bank-name of all your bills."</p>
                     <p>"What! when I didn't take them myself, they were so many?"</p>
                     <p>"But the bank had them. Take notice! its no excuse for a man when he rides
                        off the road into the swamp to be able to say: 'there was no finger board
                        sot up.' I thought of the bank, and they <emph>had</emph> registered the
                        lot."</p>
                     <p>If Roadside had had at first blush much repugnance to fall in under the
                        stranger's command, now he felt all his dislike removed. He began to feel
                        that, left to himself, spite of all his education and good gifts, he would
                        never have had the patient keenness of his singular backer. The latter,
                        nowise caring for the young man's train of thought, went on by his own
                        lightning express.</p>
                     <p>"Tharfor, as we say Georgyways, this D not coming from the thief, it is
                        clear that the other man, the one standing by the safe, who had remorse and
                        tried to insert a veto—he's the sender. The probability of <emph>two</emph>
                        persons being 'in the steal,' is strengthened, whether I'm quite round here
                        or not. <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Ergo,</foreign> as friend. Davidge says as
                        grave-digger, in 'Hamlet,' the <emph>gravemen</emph> of the charge falls
                        toward the individuals I suspect."</p>
                     <p>The cashier listened, but could not understand this monologue.</p>
                     <p>"Now then, for the second barrel," continued the stout Western man, so free
                        with his town-talk, "what'll we bring down?"</p>
                     <p>He took up the letter and envelop, and held both between him and the
                        light.</p>
                     <p>"No maker's name on the envelop—and the mark on the paper, the universal
                        Goddess of Liberty waving her cap and <unclear>sugar-stick</unclear> over a
                        Yankee mill-race. Be hanged! <emph>not</emph> the goddess, I don't mean!" He
                        read the lines over slowly, in a number of tones, and with varying
                        emphasis.</p>
                     <p>"Evidently," muttered he "a woman wrote it. No man, no man that rows the
                        same race-boats as you, Mr. Roadside, would talk about <emph>help</emph>
                        when he lends money. No, sir. A man, a fast boy would have screwed it into
                        heavy advances, 'pay it back the next Fourth of Ju-New-Year's,' but 'help?'
                        never! A woman alone, some 'good' one, I reckon, not posted in gin and toddy
                        matters, would have thought she was doing a 'composition,' safe to get the
                        first prize of the Board of Education. It's a woman of the female
                        denomination. As for 'heart going shares' inter anything, and the rest, it's
                        a spool of cotton to a hank of gold thread that no bogus Ella Zoyara writ
                        it."</p>
                     <p>"Woman!" said the younger man. "I don't know any woman to interfere with me,
                        from the First Ward to Fordham's Dam. Gipsy wouldn't be afraid to write in
                        ink out of her own bottle."</p>
                     <p>"Oh, it's not <emph>her!</emph>" said Sharpson, conclusively. "But let's go
                        on to rout out where the woman cut her words from."</p>
                     <p>He went to the window, and began to examine the pasted letters with
                        attention as scrupulous as Ottason bestowed on the ancient MSS.,
                        contributing to his "Mysteries of San Francisco," in the Astor Library.</p>
                     <p>"Small type, old style minion," said he, "yellowed paper of cheap make. Not
                        cut out of a book, for here's a newspaper fist, and a print of a house to
                        let on the back. Not out of a newspaper of yesterday, anyway. Not out of
                        ——ch, I'll swear I know the type! Bruce or Connor? Bruce's old font of
                        minion, the old, the old, before the Scotch face came in!"</p>
                     <p>He stopped with open mouth and dilated pupils, appealing to his memory to
                        concentrate its battery on one single point.</p>
                     <p>"If——"</p>
                     <p>So said he ere, applying the tip of his tongue to them, he moistened several
                        of the longer strips glued on the note paper; and, when he saw them damp
                        enough, he carefully picked them off with the point of his breastpin. On the
                        back of one of them was the head of a little negro flying with a bundle on a
                        stick, and a dollar-mark and a figure. A second piece had the three words
                        "Nig. H'd Point," and the third "orgetown."</p>
                     <p>"Fugi' slave <abbr>ad.,</abbr>" muttered Sharpson. "Southern paper. They buy
                        second-hand type, and work it to the last of the face. 'Nigger Head P'int?'
                        Where's that, lookout? 'orgetown' and Nigger Head P'int! Nigger Head P'int!
                        Georgetown, Sou' Carline, or I'll be shot!"</p>
                     <p>Sharpson laughed quietly, in the fashion of Adams when he saw his grizzlies
                        dance under the big trees of Calaveras. Indeed, he looked more of the Indian
                        hunter than the Western trader at the moment.</p>
                     <p>"The postmark," interrupted Prosper, not to be idle.</p>
                     <p>The Western man smiled.</p>
                     <p>"Shows it has been over to Brooklyn. Oh, the Uptown Branch stamp? Not worth
                        shucks. People can always walk out of their own neighborhood to post a
                        letter, of course. No use, no use. Now, about the Georgetown or Charleston,
                        more like, paper these were scissored from. Is it burnt up? Whew! or thrown
                        aside? Mebbe. No, no, it's old—it's old; if it's been kept so long there's
                        something in it worth preserving. These words came from the first two or the
                        last two columns of the inside, as the advertisements are on their back.
                        It's kept, it's kept, sure as thunder follows lightning, and it's to be had
                        for the picking up."</p>
                     <p>He folded the letter up, certain that he would discover nothing further by
                        it, but he put it carefully away in his pocket. He referred to his
                        note-book.</p>
                     <p>"A Southern, Charleston, woman," he mused, "treasures newspapers about Old
                        Times Rocks, eh? It would be strange if—"</p>
                     <p>He checked himself, pulled the pencil out of its loops, and scribbled a few
                        words on a slip of paper which he put in his vest pocket.</p>
                     <p>"Now, Mr. Roadside, if you are ready," said he, rising, we're off to see Mr.
                        Van Kieft. One word to your housekeeper, you know, for you'll not come back
                        here."</p>

                        SURPRISE—BETWEEN THE LIKED AND THE LOVED—A TEARFUL FAREWELL—MORE
                        WRITING.</head>
                     <p>When Mr. Sharpson and his companion reached Van Kieft's bank it was four
                        o'clock. A close shave if they found him in. On accosting Mr. Sanderson the
                        latter looked hard at Roadside, whom he insolently pretended not to know,
                        and answered Mr. Sharpson.</p>
                     <p>"Not in, sir. Gone home."</p>
                     <p>Whether the Westerner really knew better, or only guessed, he was not
                        satisfied with this reply. He moved along the counter, and coming to within
                        view of Master Cragin, perched on a very high stool, he said sharply, as if
                        he had a right to order: "Tom, run up stairs with this card to Mr. Van
                        Kieft."</p>
                     <p>Sanderson, like all the other clerks, though rather busy just before they
                        were closing up for the day, stared at the speaker.</p>
                     <p>Tom, too much in haste to say a word to Prosper, leaped off his seat and
                        dashed up the sta'rs with the pasteboard.</p>
                     <p>Roadside noticed that a stranger was sitting at "his" desk, in "his" private
                        office, using "his" very pen perhaps. It was a very painful position for
                        him, for all his old friends were looking at him.</p>
                     <p>"You seem to know Tom Cragin?" he whispered to Mr. Sharpson.</p>
                     <p>"It seems so."</p>
                     <p>When Burnett Canmoran had discoursed on the uncommon state of Mr. Van Kieft
                        he had not exaggerated.</p>
                     <p>Since the fatal day when, by his denunciation, the cashier had been
                        arrested, the banker, once very active for his complexion, had fallen a prey
                        to the blackest melancholy, and had quite ceased to attend to business. He,
                        a <foreign xml:lang="LAT">pater familias,</foreign> if nothing else,
                        scarcely was seen at the fireside, save at meals. Then he ate a few morsels
                        in haste, and instantly left his place. Shut up in his library at home, in
                        his private room at the bank, he was estrauged from every body.</p>
                     <p>His contracted features, his heedlessness of things in general, and his
                        continual absence of mind, betrayed the brown study upon some fixed idea or
                        the tyrannical sway of some secret sorrow.</p>
                     <p>At about four, a late hour for him, on the day of Roadside's discharge, Van
                        Keift was seated in his sanctum, his elbows on the table, his forehead
                        between his hands and his eyes fixed on vacancy, when little Tom Cragin
                        burst breathlessly into the room.</p>
                     <p>He laid the card on the table and gasped:</p>
                     <p>"This gentleman, with our old cashier, Mr. Roadside, who's come along with
                        him, sir, want to see you, sir; must see you, sir."</p>
                     <p>On these words, the banker sprang up from his chair, more amazed than if a
                        thunderbolt had fallen in the spot where the bright-eyed boy stood.</p>
                     <p>"Prosper!" he ejaculated in a voice choked with wrath, "Does he dare——"</p>
                     <p>But, comprehending that before his young clerk he ought not to give vein to
                        his fury, he succeeded in repressing it, and, in a tone relatively calm, he
                        managed to add:</p>
                     <p>"Show up the gentlemen."</p>
                     <p>If the good-humored Mr. Sharpson had reckoned upon a moving and curious
                        sight, he was not going to be mistaken.</p>
                     <p>Nothing could be more fearful than the view of the two men set face to face.
                        The banker, flushed as if he was going to drop with apoplexy; the ex-cashier
                        more livid than a corpse on the slab of the Morgue, drained of its last drop
                        of blood.</p>
                     <p>Motionless but trembling, only a yard apart at most, they exchanged looks
                        surcharged with deadly hate, as if ready to spring upon one another.</p>
                     <p>The Western man for a long minute, at least, closely scanned the pair with
                        the coldness of an Agassiz peering through a glass on two objects, only
                        useful as a subject of science. The silence grew more and more threatening,
                        until he addressed the man of money, saying:</p>
                     <p>"Of course, sir, you are aweer that my young nevy has been acquitted——"</p>
                     <p>"Yes," gasped Mr. Van Kief, trying his best not to permit an outbreak; "yes,
                        for want of sufficient evidence."</p>
                     <p>"Just so, just so, for want of sufficient evidence to clear him altogether.
                        Until that turns up, he thinks of going to Californy."</p>
                     <p>Upon this programme Van Kieft's physiognomy abruptly changed. His features
                        relaxed as if he had been put out of pain.</p>
                     <p>"Going, going!"</p>
                     <p>The <emph>tone</emph> made "going" mean "running away," and it was a cutting
                        insult.</p>
                     <p>But the Western man did not care to notice the slur.</p>
                     <p>"I rayther think the boy's well advised. I've been around to El Dorado
                        myself, and a man who won't go near the mines is safe to do well. So, before
                        he goes, I thought he ought to see you the last time, only to say good-bye,
                        you know, the good old fashioned way."</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Roadside," returned the banker, smiling bitterly, "is sure to do well.
                        But he might have spared himself much trouble. I have nothing to hear from
                        him—to say to him."</p>
                     <p>This being a formal leave, Sharpson put on his hat, left on a chair on
                        entering, and went out with his young friend, who had not uttered a word,
                        down the stairs and into the street, before the cashier spoke.</p>
                     <p>"You forced me to," he said in a hollow voice; "and I've gone through it.
                        Well, are you satisfied? Now, what have I made by having this fresh
                        humiliation filed among the other papers?"</p>
                     <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC8328-00000020"/>
                     <p>"You, nothing," rejoined the other; "but I, a good deal. I couldn't have
                        seen the banker except by your means, and now I know what I was after. I
                        have the certainty that Mr. Van Kieft had no hand in the robbery."</p>
                     <p>"Pooh! anybody can lay it on?"</p>
                     <p>"But not so naturally as that. And, besides, I 'wanted to know,'
                           <unclear>Massychoositts</unclear> style, if your old boss wasn't a good
                        target for certain suspicions. He is, I see."</p>
                     <p>So saying, he hailed a stage going up Broadway, and the two jumped in.</p>
                     <p>Prosper saw that his leader, so to call him, was full of thought, and
                        referred to his watch as they passed the Hall in a rather uneasy manner, and
                        he did not even trouble him with an inquiry as to their destination.</p>
                     <p>On the block, shady side, above Spring street was located Dominick's "Oyster
                        Bay."</p>
                     <p>There Mr. Sharpson and his companion alighted, and the former piloted him
                        down the steps into the basement saloon.</p>
                     <p>"We'll have the meal we have earned," said the Westerner, as he sat down at
                        a table, after questioning the colored proprietor in a private manner.</p>
                     <p>They had trifled with the suced cabbage and had begun, Sharpson on a "dozen
                        fried" and Roadside at a stew, when a boy hurriedly ran down the steps,
                        slapped a paper on the bar to call Dominick's attention to it, and dashed
                        out without saying one word. Sharpson started to his feet. The negro had no
                        sooner set eyes on the paper than he left the bar to give it to the Western
                        man.</p>
                     <p>"De document for you, sah, Mis'er Sharpson!"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, I know the boy."</p>
                     <p>He ravenously devoured the scanty contents of the note.</p>
                     <p>"Swallow, what you got in your spoon," said he at once to Roadside. "What a
                        lucky thing we came in here."</p>
                     <p>He put on his hat, while Roadside mechanically but wonderingly followed his
                        example.</p>
                     <p>"Who'd 'a' thought it was <emph>this</emph> evening instead of to-morrow in
                        the day," muttered Sharpson, making for the door. "But women are always out
                        of ail calculation. Bye, bye, Dominick; score that up, the old name!"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, sah, and mo', if you say so! You're good for it!"</p>
                     <p>"Come along, Prosper!"</p>
                     <p>They were up the steps in a twinkling.</p>
                     <p>"Can you walk well? Let's see you let out. It's only to Waverley place.
                        Whip, start—go!"</p>
                     <p>At the risk of upsetting passers-by, the two men started at a good pace up
                        town.</p>
                     <p>On reaching Waverley place, Sharpson stopped, but very far from as much
                        distressed as a man of his build promised to be. "Excuse me," said he to
                        Prosper, "but something has happened quicker than I expected. All the
                        better, I hope. There's nothing like gaining time. Here we are."</p>
                     <p>A few doors from the hotel there was a plate on a door-post to the effect: <q>
                           <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Second Floor.<lb/> MADAME FLEURETTE,<lb/> Modes et
                              Confections.<lb/> From Paris!"</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>No doubt in this case there was some truth in the last two words, for, when
                        the two men had gone straight up stairs, past the dentist's, on the ground
                        floor, the door Sharpson knocked at was opened by a woman, who said:</p>
                     <p>"Ah! Monsieur——"</p>
                     <p>She was a woman of about forty, but coquettishly attired, and her very black
                        hair was a triumph of the effects of lime-juice and bandoline. She curtseyed
                        very humbly to the Westerner.</p>
                     <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Eh bien?</foreign>" said he.</p>
                     <p>The woman nodded.</p>
                     <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">La n'est ce pas?</foreign>" queried Sharpson,
                        pointing to the side-door.</p>
                     <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Non,</foreign>" replied the woman in a low voice;
                           "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">dans le grand salon!</foreign>" Whereupon
                        Sharpson strode forward and gently pushed Prosper into the front parlor,
                        saying in his ear:</p>
                     <p>"Keep cool!"</p>
                     <p>But what was the use of the advice? Upon his first glance into the room,
                        wherei to he had been pushed without any warning, Prosper uttered a loud
                        outcry:</p>
                     <p>"Viandra!"</p>
                     <p>Mr. Van Kieft's niece was indeed there, handsomer than ever, in all the
                        grace of that calm, serene loveliness which compels admiration and respect.
                        On perceiving Roadside, all her blood rushed to her face, her beautiful eyes
                        half closed, as maidens' do when they are kissed, and, as if going to faint
                        away, she leaned on a table, which was covered with variegated silk, no
                        doubt for the famous Empire State costume.</p>
                     <p>Prosper knew that his beloved was not one of those strong-minded women whose
                        icy heart leaves their brain always free. Such have sensations, but never a
                        real feeling, mere heroines of novels who have an expedient for every
                        event.</p>
                     <p>A gentle and meditative spirit, her unclouded life had turned her into
                        exquisite sensibility, almost too fine. But she had strong pride, and was
                        incapable of haggling where conscience had set its price. When duty spoke,
                        she obeyed.</p>
                     <p>Her weakness was over in a moment, and her eyes, lately so affectionate,
                        only now expressed haughtiness and resentment. It was in quite an offended
                        tone that she said:</p>
                     <p>"What has made you, sir, so bold as to spy my goings out? How dare you
                        follow me into this store?"</p>
                     <p>To be sure, Roadside was not guilty, and he was willing to explain it all by
                        a word, but the powerlessness he was in to utter his thoughts enchained his
                        tongue.</p>
                     <p>"Upon your word and honor," proceeded Viandra, "you promised me not to try
                        to see me again! Is this the way you keep your word?"</p>
                     <p>"I promised, Miss Oestervelt, but——"</p>
                     <p>"Speak," said she, seeing he paused.</p>
                     <p>"So many events have happened this day that I might readily have forgotten
                        the pledge that was drawn from me in a moment of weakness. It is to chance,
                        at least to a will not my own, that I owe the happiness of seeing you once
                        again. Alas! my heart leaped with delight this minute now fled! I did not
                        fancy—no, I could not fancy—that you, more pitiless than all the world
                        beside, would repulse one so wretched as I am!"</p>
                     <p>If he had only been a little less excited he might have watched in Viandra's
                        eyes—those stars so long the arbiters of his career—the traces of the
                        struggle she was waging against herself.</p>
                     <p>"Prosper," said she, in a quite steady voice, "nevertheless, you know me
                        well enough to be sure that nothing can befall you that will not make my
                        heart ache! You suffer, and I feel for you like a sister for a
                        dearly-beloved brother——"</p>
                     <p>"A sister!" sneered the young man; "ay, that's the same word you uttered
                        that day when you banished me from your presence. A sister! If only that,
                        why did you let me revel in such sweet mistakes. Was I only a brother to you
                        when I was seventeen, and we went to Twenty-eighth street school together?
                        Was I only a bro her to you when I rescued you from the rowdies at Glen
                        Cove, fought the crowd of them and brought you in to Mr. Kennard's in
                        safety? There, recovering on the sofa (how clearly I see it all again), you
                        were happy, you <emph>said,</emph> that I should have been so hasty in
                        acknowledging my love that you were saved from confessing yours. You snapped
                        your necklet in two, remember? and when you gave me one half, you told me to
                        wear it in token of your love, brighter and less perishable than gold and
                        jewels. It would be good fortune to me.'"</p>
                     <p>The young lady tried by a wave of the hand to check him, but he did not see
                        her.</p>
                     <p>"Three years from <emph>that</emph> day," continued he, "one year from
                           <emph>this</emph> day, you bound me to forego that pledge and never see
                        you again! If I only were let know why I displease you? You won't tell me
                        anything? You drove me away, and in obeying you, I tried to make everybody
                        believe that it was all my fault. You said, indeed, that an insurmountable
                        obstacle rose between your dear self and me, which I believed—the greater
                        fool! The obstacle was your heart, Viandra! How little of good fortune your
                        token brought me!"</p>
                     <p>White and still as a statue, the girl cowered before this whirlwind of a
                        passion fiercer than she had dreamed of. Large tears ran silently down her
                        cheeks.</p>
                     <p>"I told you to forget," she very softly said.</p>
                     <p>"Forget!" ejaculated the young man. "Oh, you have never loved! To forget you
                        is as easy and as hard as to stop the pulse-beat of my heart—the one old
                        way—I can die!"</p>
                     <p>This word, thus uttered with wild resolution, shocked the heater.</p>
                     <p>"Unhappy man!" she cried.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, a thousand times less happy than you can imagine! You cannot credit
                        what a man feels when each day of a whole year has been forty hours'
                        torment. You speak of forgetfulness, so easy to women, who can find it in
                        nursing others' babes, in fondling little children. A man must plunge deep
                        for it, travel far, soar high, or sink very, very low. I have sought it in
                        the dregs of envenomed glasses, in the purchased kisses of the ineffably
                        impure, and found it not! I have tried to quench the memory of the past,
                        which burns in me like the inextinguishable fires of the after-death, but
                        all in vain. When the body fell like a sapless tree, still something
                        remained alive within it. I have lain awake all night, staring at the black
                        wall across which your beauty eternally flitted, come again as last as it
                        went. I often, and often again, was but the breadth of a pistol-ball from
                        the repose of suicide——"</p>
                     <p>"I forbid you to say that sinful word!"</p>
                     <p>"If you loved, you might command, Viandra. As it is, what am I to you?"</p>
                     <p>With a wave of her hand, Viandra interrupted him as if to speak, to explain
                        and exculpate herself, perhaps. But some speedy reflection arrested her, for
                        she wept again and only moaned:</p>
                     <p>"Oh, good Heaven, what a world of pain it is!"</p>
                     <p>Prosper appeared to mistake the sense of her exclamation.</p>
                     <p>"Your pity comes too late," he said, with heartrending resignation. "There's
                        no possible happiness for me! I hoped for too much, and, disappointed, not
                        one thing binds me to life. In me you have killed the holiest beliefs. I
                        leave prison, dishonored by enemies, to become—God knows! I look forward
                        uselessly; I see no hope, no smile, no sunny glimmer—not the twinkle of the
                        star above the horizon. I look around me and see only shame and
                        despair."</p>
                     <p>"Prosper, my friend, my brother! if you but knew——"</p>
                     <p>"I know this only, that you cared for me when we were younger, but now you
                        love me as little as I love you much."</p>
                     <p>He paused for a reply, but none came. A sob did break the silence, though.
                        But it came from Viandra's servant or companion, a young woman who had
                        withdrawn to the window, and now was weeping there.</p>
                     <p>Miss Oestervelt had forgotten all about her, while Roadside had no eyes but
                        for his first love. Now she looked. The young woman, neatly dressed, was,
                        beyond mistake, Gipsy, Miss Raymond!</p>
                     <p>So great was the shock to Prosper, that it prevented even a word in surprise
                        from him.</p>
                     <p>There he stood, only think! between the two women who decided his
                        life—between Viandra, the rich young lady whom he adored, but who rejected
                        him, and Gipsy, the nymph of the pave, who adored him, but whom he
                        scorned.</p>
                     <p>She had heard all, poor shameful creature; she had seen her beloved's
                        passion for another pour forth in dreadful regrets and wild menaces. By what
                        he writhed beneath Prosper could judge what she must endure. For she,
                        tainted beyond cure, could not hope ever being admitted by the wildest love
                        in among lambs of the social flock. What ought not her anger and her
                        humiliation be, now that she learnt that she had been but a pillow to break
                        his fall, but a lake into which he could plunge, not to otherwise break his
                        head on the land.</p>
                     <p>Therefore he was amazed that Gipsy, who was violence personified, should
                        dwell there weeping, and not fly at his face, or, at the very least, not
                        curse him.</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile, Viandra had succeeded apparently in regaining calmness. Slowly,
                        with unconscious action, she took up her furred mantle from a chair, and
                        dressing to depart, said:</p>
                     <p>"Why ever did you come, Prosper? Both of us have need of our entire courage.
                        You are wretched, yes; but I am far more miserable than you. You have a
                        right to cry out, but I must not show a tear, and, while my heart is cleft
                        asunder, must smile and smile. You can confide in some consoling friend. I
                        only to my mother—and she is dead—in heaven!"</p>
                     <p>The young man tried to stammer some reply, but the words died away on his
                        lips.</p>
                     <p>"Indeed, I have forgotten nothing," pursued the lady. "But don't let that
                        truth restore you any hope—there is no future for us together! If you do
                        love me, live; for you won't, please, be so cruel as to add to my tortures
                        the great grief of your death. A day may come when I can be let justify
                        myself. Now, oh, my brother, my best lov—friend! good-by! God ever bless
                        you!"</p>
                     <p>She had come very close to Prosper, and had but to bend forward to leave a
                        kiss and a tear on his cheek. Then she fled precipitately, followed by
                        Gipsy.</p>
                     <p>So Prosper was left alone, and he seemed to awake. He tried to recall what
                        had transpired, wondering if he had not been the victim of a dream, or if
                        his reason was not gone. He could not be blind to the handiwork of that man
                        who had only that day first appeared unto him. Commonplace as he was in
                        speech and aspect, whence was his mysterious power to sway events? He seemed
                        to forecast everything; he knew Tom Cragin; he must have been informed of
                        Miss Oestervelt's movements, and the independent Gipsy had been bound down
                        to service, perhaps by him.</p>
                     <p>He worked himself up to such a pitch of exasperation that when Mr. Sharpson
                        walked into the dressmaker's parlor, he rushed up to him like an escaped
                        maniac, and challenged him roughly—</p>
                     <p>"Who are you?"</p>
                     <p>The stout man seemed but very little taken aback by this outburst.</p>
                     <p>"Your father's friend. What else d'ye mean?" he asked.</p>
                     <p>"That's no answer, sir. In a moment of foolishness, I might have abdicated
                        my will for another's rule, but now——"</p>
                     <p>"What now? Do you want a dime biography of me? Where I was born, where
                        colleged, where I first bought and sold barl's of prime<pb n="40-41"
                           xml:id="VAC8328-00000021"/> moss? What's that to you? I told you I would
                        save you out of the tangle you're in. If I do save you, what are you
                        stand-and-delivering me for? I should jest like for to know?"</p>
                     <p>"I have a right to learn how you are going to do it."</p>
                     <p>"What's the use?"</p>
                     <p>"To accept or reject your means."</p>
                     <p>"If I promise you to succeed?"</p>
                     <p>"That's not enough. It don't suit me to be a child in apron-strings, exposed
                        to such tests as I have been this day. A man of my age ought to know what he
                        is doing."</p>
                     <p>"Prosper Roadside, when a man of your age is blind, he gets a guide, and
                        ought'nt to set up to tell about the lampposts they ain't a-going to run up
                        against. Ever heard of Lord Bumble-land, a young English sprig of nobility?
                        Well, he came out West, with an Oxford education, a patent lock-fast fancy
                        gun, and a hunting experience of two seasons after partridge and grouse—he
                        could kill but'lo, he could! he on like to set eyes on Injin! he'd as lifer,
                        if not liefer, fall in with a ten-brave party of Comanche, or 'Pash, as
                        drink his patent coffee (in cakes like black soap)! Wall, he left Fort
                        Chabonard with no blarsted 'Merican' guide, and the next thing seen of him
                        some Pah Yutes brought him in on a pony, naked as a harless bar, thin as a
                        sick rail, and poor-looking as no lord never was afore. He did it without a
                        guide! <emph>He</emph> was about <emph>your</emph> age, Prosper!"</p>
                     <p>The half-mocking, half-pitying tone in which Mr. Sharpson told his little
                        anecdote was not calculated to soothe the iritated listener.</p>
                     <p>"Well, then," said he, "since it's come to it, I thank you for what you have
                        done. If I was willing to fight for my honor and life, it was because I
                        thought that, spite of all, Miss Oestervelt would be mine. I know now that
                        all is ended between us; let it be so between you and me."</p>
                     <p>The resolve was so firm that the hearer appeared to be shaken for an
                        instant.</p>
                     <p>"You're mad," said he.</p>
                     <p>"No! Miss Oestervelt don't love me, and what's all the rest to me!"</p>
                     <p>"Lordee!" exclaimed the Western man, touched by so much despair, "don't you
                        suspect anything underboard? Couldn't you see the false keel of her
                        speech?"</p>
                     <p>Prosper clenched his fist.</p>
                     <p>"Do you mean to say you were listening?"</p>
                     <p>"At the keyhole, to every word. Not according to the 'Perfect Gents Own
                        Book,' but the end justifies the means. I am glad I listened, for otherwise
                        I would not be able to say: Keep a stiff upper lip, my boy. The lady loves
                        you, and never has ceased to do so."</p>
                     <p>Just as the dying man will open his ear to the doctor's lulling words,
                        Prosper drank in this very precise affirmation.</p>
                     <p>"Ah, if I might believe so," he sighed, suddenly calmed.</p>
                     <p>"Believe me, for I ain't no lover to be deceived. I saw a generous young
                        girl, putting her love against something or other that she thinks is her
                        duty. Did not your heart feel as much when she said, so touchingly, her good
                        bye?"</p>
                     <p>"She loves me, is free, and yet flies from me——"</p>
                     <p>"Who says she is free! No! she is not. She is obeying some higher power, an
                        irresistible one. She is sacrificing herself! we must learn for whom, and
                        perhaps that secret has to do with the riddle of the machinations against
                        you."</p>
                     <p>As this was being said, Prosper's rebellion melted away, and hope and trust
                        returned to him.</p>
                     <p>"If you should be speaking the truth——"</p>
                     <p>"You unfortunate fellow! why do you persist in blocking up the doorway
                        against the truck-load of evidence. Don't you understand that Miss
                        Oestervelt knows the name of the real thief!"</p>
                     <p>"Impossible!"</p>
                     <p>"No. sir. But no power can tear that name from her. She sacrifices you, true
                        enough, but she has just sacrificed herself."</p>
                     <p>The young man was subdued, but he could not so easily turn away from the
                        room where he so unexpectedly encountered the beauty.</p>
                     <p>"Alas!" he said, squeezing his companion's hand, "I must look like a fool to
                        you, but it's because you can't think how much pain I am in!"</p>
                     <p>The stout man sadly shook his head. In one second his face changed, his so
                        very bright eyes were clouded and his voice quivered.</p>
                     <p>"What you suffer," said he, "many men have undergone. I have known the like.
                        You love a pure and noble maid. I took a guilty thing from the
                        street-corner, from under the lamp-post, and tried to make something like a
                        decent girl of her. But one day, when she was most full of promise, and I
                        began to fancy that women had something holy and imperishable in them, she
                        left me, who would have done almost anything for her, for a man who scorned
                        her. I believe, like you, though an older man, that I thought of making a
                        hole in the water or in my head, but I remembered that my life might be of
                        worth to the world—if not to the world to my country, or at least to my
                        city. Besides, weeping and wailing would not have brought her back to me,
                        for passion does not reason, and she is wild for this man."</p>
                     <p>"Don't you know him?"</p>
                     <p>"Very well! Oh, you mean why haven't I fought him? Why, because she's a bad
                        girl, and, to my thinking, few <emph>good</emph> girls are worth duelling
                        over! Besides," he added in a peculiar tone, "What some people call chance,
                        and other some fate; but which you and me before we die will call God,
                        perhaps, hath promised to take vengeance into His own hands."</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Sharpson," said Prosper, after having been silent for some time, "I
                        have made up my mind. My name is in bad odor, not only for me but for the
                        old folks, so I am fully ready to obey you in all things. I trust you are
                        quite right about Viandra."</p>
                     <p>That same day, while the auctioneer's men were clearing out his private
                        residence, Roadside had his other goods brought away from his Brooklyn
                        house. He wrote to half a dozen friends, to his club and the Mercantile
                        Library, that he was going off to San Francisco, overland, without
                        delay.</p>
                     <p>But in the evening he and Mr. Sharpson were entered on the books of the Old
                        Pear Tree House.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Margetson had given the ex-cashier her bedroom, that which Miss Raymond
                        had previously occupied. It was a mere side-show compared with the style he
                        had been in the habit of living in, but he was in no state to draw
                        contrasts. Turning on the sorry sofa he ran over the day's doings, finding a
                        bitter pleasure in his hermitage from the world. Toward eleven at night,
                        after supping in his room lightly, he felt the air very close, thanks to the
                        stovepipe running through his room, and after pressing his brow against the
                        cold panes some time he thought of opening the window. But the eagerness
                        with which the damp March wind rushed in made him quickly slam the sash
                        down.</p>
                     <p>But the blast had done its work. Out of one of the shaking curtains a scrap
                        of paper whirled. Mechanically Prosper picked it up, and brought it near the
                        lamp. It was covered with Gipsy's writing—hers beyond mistake. It was a
                        fragment of a draft of a letter; and if the dislocated limbs of sentences
                        gave no satisfactory meaning, they were more than sufficient to point the
                        mind's eye toward a multitude of North Stars.</p>
                     <p>The fragment was as follows:</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>"——from Mr. Clanmoran.<lb/> have been very foo——<lb/> ——set against him
                           who never——<lb/> ——warn Prosper, and then——<lb/> ——best friend, he——<lb/>
                           ——marry Miss Oeste——"</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>It murdered Prosper's sleep that night.</p>

                     <p>However, toward dawn of the dark and showever morning. Roadside did fall
                        into slumber. He was aroused by a knocking on the door.</p>
                     <p>"Won't you have some dinner before you go out, sir," queried Mrs.
                        Margetson's voice outside in the passage, "seeing you would not get up to
                        breakfast?"</p>
                     <p>"Dinner! breakfast!" repeated Roadside, rolling off his bed, feeling as
                        queer as one usually does after a sleep in one's clothes.</p>
                     <p>He ran to the window. It was day, sure enough, though not a pleasant
                        one.</p>
                     <p>Trembling, for fear he had been wasting preious time, he opened the
                        door.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, you are up!" cried the landlady.</p>
                     <p>"Where's Mr. Sharpson?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh, he went down town last night. He begs you to meet him, sir. at where
                        you were yesterday afternoon—Dominick's, on Broadway."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, I know."</p>
                     <p>"At two o'clock. It's som'at after twelve only now. I've a beautiful cold
                        bam and some eggs I was trying for my own dinner, for none of our boarders
                        come home to their mid-day meal."</p>
                     <p>"Oh, anything you like. I'll finish dressing and come to the parlor."</p>
                     <p>Feeling as if crippled by the absence of his well-termed "guide," the young
                        man was all quickness in repairing the disorder of his clothes. He ate at
                        American traveler's speed, and little at that; and, merely saying that after
                        all it was better to be too early than to be too late, he started for down
                        town.</p>
                     <p>He would have liked to have questioned Mrs. Margetson about Mr. Sharpson,
                        whom she seemed to know very well, but reflecting that it was very
                        ungrateful of him to repay so hearty a supporter with curiosity about him,
                        he did not embrace the opportunity.</p>
                     <p>Luckily, though it was not yet half-past one when he walked into the Oyster
                        Bay, he was happy to find Mr. Sharpson already arrived, and playing
                        billiards with the marker to keep his Land in.</p>
                     <p>"Glad you've come early," said the Western man, shaking the cashiers hand
                        heartily; "It saves me some waiting. Sit down. Did you dine before you left
                        the hotel? That's right. Always get a meal when you can—you may not have a
                        chance when you most surely expect to. Sit down, I say."</p>
                     <p>They took seats at one of the tables along the side of the long saloon.
                        There were about a dozen oyster lovers discussing the edible, scattered
                        about the place.</p>
                     <p>"What was Mrs. Margetson's word for me?" inquired Sharpson, sipping his
                        lager.</p>
                     <p>"Only that she had bought all the things down on the list you gave her, and
                        they would be sent to the hotel to-morrow or so."</p>
                     <p>"That's the cider. All's slick, for I have got great news."</p>
                     <p>They spoke in a subdued tone, and the other frequenters had their own
                        business to attend to, so that there was no risk of their being over
                        heard.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Sharpson had taken out his note-book—a book which bad an answer for
                        every question, like the magic volume in fairy tales.</p>
                     <p>"While we wait for some messengers of mine to come here and report," said
                        he, "suppose we set Mr. Burnett Clanmoran up till we've knocked him
                        down."</p>
                     <p>Roadside did not protest, as he had previously. Like those minute insects
                        which, once having bored into the heart of a tree, eat it up, sap and trunk,
                        to the last grain in one night; suspicion, once in the mind, spreads, and
                        soon devours the most solid beliefs. Clanmoran's visit, and the remnant of
                        Gipsy's letter, had inspired Prosper with doubts which strengthened every
                        hour.</p>
                     <p>"Now, my dear friend, do you know," began Mr. Sharpson, lighting a cigar,
                        "where exactly this youth hails from, who so loudly says he's your
                        friend?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes. He comes from near where Mrs. Van Kieft lived; the neighborhood of
                        Charleston, South Carolina."</p>
                     <p>"You'd like to bet on that?"</p>
                     <p>"Any amount, sir. Not only has he told me so often, but I have heard him
                        tell Mr. Van Kieft as much, as well as repeat it a hundred times to Mrs. Van
                        Kieft, when she spoke of her early days."</p>
                     <p>"So, about this there can be no possible doubt or error?"</p>
                     <p>"None, sir."</p>
                     <p>"Which makes it very singular!" said Mr. Sharpson, making a ring in the air
                        with the cigar smoke, and poking his finger through the circle to "show
                        there was no deception."</p>
                     <p>"What's singular?" inquired the puzzled cashier.</p>
                     <p>"What is going on," was the reply. "Charleston," said he, as if reading a
                        page from a geography or gazetteer—"Charleston is the capital of South
                        Carolina, on the junction of the Cooper and Ashley Rivers, containing a
                        population of several white, red, yellow, black, and spotted people, with
                        statues to her little men and paintings of the great ones in the Mayor's
                        room of the City Hall, with hotels for travelers who like a horn at meals,
                        and hotels for dittoes who don't like horns, with watermelons plenty in the
                        markets, pianos in the houses of all married lawyers, but—no nevy to Mrs.
                        Andrew Van Kieft."</p>
                     <p>Roadside was on burning coals.</p>
                     <p>"For mercy's sake, don't go on so!"</p>
                     <p>"There is to be seen there,' proceeded Mr. Sharpson, "the son of the man who
                        fired the first shot at the British fleet from Sullivan's Island, and the
                        daughter of the man who shot Cunnle Tarleton, but nary Clanmoran Burnett, or
                        otherwise, of the masculine persuasion. There are histories of the poets,
                        generals, admirals, and planters, in the bookstores and libraries, but not
                        of your friend."</p>
                     <p>"But, sir, I have seen proofs——"</p>
                     <p>"Of course! They can make anything these days. Come, I ain't a Monroe
                        Edwards improved up to date, but I'll write you a letter that you won't know
                        from your own screed! Proofs can be turned out as by a press, and relations
                        can be ground out like the waste apples from a cider-press. Your proofs are
                        suspicious, but I've got something that will wash! While you were rolling on
                        your bed in your boots last night, I was down in Wall street studying the
                        electric and magnetic telegraph. I messaged what I wanted to discover to
                        Charleston, and I have the answers. A little patience," said he, turning
                        over the leaves of his memoranda, while the cashier let his cigar go out in
                        sheer surprise.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, here's number one. The chief of police tells me: 'Clanmoran: One of the
                        first families, formerly from Scotland, original settlers on the Cooper
                        River——'"</p>
                     <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC8328-00000022"/>
                     <p>"There you see!" exclaimed Roadside.</p>
                     <p>"Don't run away with yourself!" said Sharpson, proceeding: "'The last of the
                        Clanmorans married, 1829, Miss Moultrina Sealand of Georgetown. Died, Dec.,
                        48, leaving only two daughters. Books in our office and the Mayor's mention
                        nobody else of the name.' Well," said the Westerner, chuckling, "What do you
                        think of My Own Correspondent?"</p>
                     <p>Prosper was confounded.</p>
                     <p>"How then could Mr. Van Kieft treat Burnett like his nephew?"</p>
                     <p>"Like his wife's nephew, you mean, I guess. But let's go at another answer.
                        It tells all about the big income of your friend: 'Henry Pinckney Clanmoran,
                        last of his name, died as telegraphed, a <emph>poor white.</emph> The
                        Sealands were against his merriage, out him, and his plantation flooding, he
                        wasn't worth a pistareen. One daughter, music-teacher in town, single. The
                        other a small planter's wife, up-river. To clinch the nail, I inquired
                        again: 'Sure that's all in <emph>that</emph> basket?' 'Quite. Just asked
                        Hen. Sandlers. He never heard of anybody else.' "There you are," said the
                        Western man; "all they could tick-tick on the 'stripe' for my money."</p>
                     <p>"Am I awake?"</p>
                     <p>"Very good! Now, I have one remark to make. Some fellows would, perhaps
                        object that Mrs. Clanmoran, after her husband's decease, might have
                        miss-behaved, and let her little stranger carry a name he had no right to.
                        But that's matched by your friend's age. Clanmoran is all of
                        four-and-twenty, while Mr. Clanmoran, the genuine, died under twenty years
                        ago."</p>
                     <p>"But, who is Burnett, then?" asked Roadside, compelled to believe.</p>
                     <p>"Papers don't say! Frankly, it is harder to find out who he is than who he
                        ain't. One single man can enlighten us on that p'int——"</p>
                     <p>"Yes——"</p>
                     <p>"But he won't!"</p>
                     <p>"Oh, you mean Colonel Haviland?"</p>
                     <p>"Ed-zactly!"</p>
                     <p>"He has always filled me with an inexplicable repulsion," observed Roadside.
                        "I hope you have some intelligence about him?" "Well, I had some
                        elucidations about him long ago," replied Mr. Sharpson. "I went over to
                        Jersey, and, after a day's fishing for shiners in Shiners' Bay, I made out
                        pretty well. But I expect more. There's none of it favorable, don't be
                        alarmed. Here's what I have got:</p>
                     <p>"'Girard Haviland, born near Georgetown, S. C.'——"</p>
                     <p>"Georgetown again!" exclaimed Roadside. "Why, that's the place you said that
                        newspaper must have come from that was cut up to form that letter to
                        me."</p>
                     <p>"Found that out, have you?" laughed the Western man, throwing his cigar-butt
                        on the floor and stamping the fire out. "High time! But just let me get
                        through. Yes, Haviland's a Georgetowner, like 'em all! Had an elder brother,
                        Morgan. In 1842. Morgan killed a man in a bar-room fight and badly wounded
                        another. He left the country. He was a good fellow, liked by everybody while
                        his brother was not thought much of. When their father died, Girard went
                        North, and, in Baltimore and Washington, got rid in two years of not only
                        what money was left him, but his brother's share. Penniless, Girard went off
                        to Texas with the volunteers, but, was so dishonest that, being
                        quarter-master. Colonel J——n made a major of him so that he would not only
                        be farther from the stores but run some chance of being killed. He came back
                        a colonel, however. No particular story of him, but that he had a bad name
                        in New Orleans, and, in Coventry, wounded a girl in a gambling-house.</p>
                     <p>"'Latterly, he turned up in New York'——"</p>
                     <p>"Now, I know all about it," said Mr. Sharpson.</p>
                     <p>"'Very poor, living on women in Mott street, "in" with some of the worst
                        characters. He couldn't get tick to a glass of rot-gut when he suddenly
                        heard of his brother's return alive. Morgan had gone to China, taken to the
                        military service under an American mandarin, and the two had made a large
                        fortune. Morgan had, while casting cannon for the pig-tails, found out
                        several improvements in smelting and fusing metals, and, thus directed to
                        it, bought the foundry of the exploded Shiner's Bay Company, New Jersey.
                        But, six months ago, he died in the arms of his brother Guard, who thus
                        inherited a large fortune.'"</p>
                     <p>Prosper considered. Since Mr. Sharpson had laid bare his method to him, he
                        began to understand its workings. So, likewise, he tried to group facts, to
                        adjust circumstances to suspicions he had formed.</p>
                     <p>"From what you tell me," he said at length, "it results that our Haviland
                        was in deep distress when I first met him at Mr. Van Kieft's?"</p>
                     <p>"Clearly."</p>
                     <p>"And shortly afterwards Mr. Burnett Clanmoran came from down South?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes."</p>
                     <p>"And a month or so after his arrival Miss Oestervelt stopped my calls on
                        her?"</p>
                     <p>"Go it!" said Mr. Sharpson; "you begin to 'take form' and see the weight of
                        trifles."</p>
                     <p>He was interrupted by the entrance of a new comer.</p>
                     <p>He was a picture!</p>
                     <p>He came down the outer steps, with a bulldog at his heels, whistling "The
                        Boy in Yellow wins the day" between his teeth, as an ostler does while
                        curry-combing a horse.</p>
                     <p>He strode up to the bar with a sort of swing to his bandy legs. He was
                        dressed in the American adaptation of English groomery, with shiny boots
                        with turn-down tops of red, "riding trousers" warranted not to require
                        straps, a canary waistcoat with horn buttons, a blue with white birdseye
                        neckerchief, with a broach of Lady Suffolk's hair, and the wristbands of a
                        red and black hooped jockey shirt appeared from under the too-short sleeves
                        of his grey cutaway. He carried a cane whip, without the thong, in his coat
                        flap pocket. After a word with Dominick at the bar, he glanced down the
                        room, and seeing his dog (with a bandy-legged walk copied after him) roll
                        toward Mr. Sharpson, who seemed to recognize the animal, he went in the same
                        direction.</p>
                     <p>"Well, Joe?" queried the Western man, not looking at the horsey
                        individual.</p>
                     <p>"Don't speak to me, sir," answered the latter; we've got to play
                        cautious!"</p>
                     <p>All the attention of which Roadside was capable was concentrated on this
                        "stunning" groom or coachman, as the case might be. He was like a tigure
                        from Frith's Derby Day."</p>
                     <p>Somehow or other, he bethought him that he had seen that face before. Surely
                        he had seen somewhere that retreating forehead and those eyes or
                        restlessness. But where he could not determine.</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile, Joseph had seated himself, not at their table, but between that
                        and the next, bestriding a chair, facing the right hand outer corner of the
                        farther table, with one eye toward the doorway and the other upon Mr.
                        Sharpson, whose back, however, was turned on him.</p>
                     <p>He had called for a glass of L. L. whisky, but Dominick, who appeared to
                        know him, had brought the decanter itself, besides the water pitcher and a
                        glass, to set before him. Scientifically, he poured in the quantum of liquor
                        and let the water drop into it slowly, and from a hight so that the fluid
                        drove through to the bottom and then rose, doubly impregnated with the
                        spirituous flavor.</p>
                     <p>"Speak," said Sharpson.</p>
                     <p>The dog having been patted, and his throat scratched by the Westerner, and
                        having sniffed warily at Prosper, walked into the center of the saloon and
                        deliberately lay down, with his tail straight out behind him, as if
                        perfectly conscious that nobody would step on it, or fall over him. Each
                        time that a person came in or went out, or a chair moved, his eyes opened
                        quickly and then languidly closed.</p>
                     <p>"To begin with, sir, I must say," said the groom, "that all's not roses for
                        Colonel H.'s valet-carriage-driver."</p>
                     <p>"Go on; you can grumble next week."</p>
                     <p>"Right. Well, yesterday he went out a-foot about 2o'clock. Of course I
                        attended to him! He went to the O. P. T. house to meet G."</p>
                     <p>"And Mrs. M. said she had gone for good. Well?"</p>
                     <p>"He did'nt take it easy. I assure you. He came back by the Fourth avenue
                        cars, and ran across from the Bowery. The other, B. C., was at the Prescott
                        waiting for him. I'd like to take my master found to exhibit his talent for
                        swearing! He has'nt a match either side of the Mississippi. The young fellow
                        wanted to know what new event had made him so peppery. 'Nothing,' said my
                        master, 'only the little jade'—he said as much as sister to Ketchem."</p>
                     <p>The bulldog lifted his heavy head off his fore paws.</p>
                     <p>"But I'll say 'jade' as more proper. 'The little jade has cut, don't know
                        where!' They both looked queer over it. 'Does she know anything serious?'
                        asked B. C. 'She only knows what I told you,' answered the Colonel. 'but
                        that little coming to a man with open eyes may put him on the scent.'"</p>
                     <p>Sharpson smiled as it he had reasons to rightfully value Colonel Haviland's
                        fears.</p>
                     <p>"The fact is, your master is not absolutely devoid of common sense, Joe.
                        Sail on!"</p>
                     <p>"At that the young shaver turned green as Gimblet's ghost, and says he: 'If
                        it's so bad, we must put the little sister to Ketchum'——"</p>
                     <p>The dog showed his teeth without opening his eyes.</p>
                     <p>"'Put her out of the way!' Sweet-tempered youth! But the Colonel laughed.
                        'You're a blockhead,' said he; 'when such night-walkers are in the way, you
                        don't want to kick 'em off the flags, but give the peelers a quarter to lock
                        'em up!' They laughed then."</p>
                     <p>"They're welcome to," said Sharpson, "the idea 's neat enough, only it's a
                        little too late to think of it. The nothing, as the Colonel feared,
                           <emph>has</emph> fallen into a knowing ear."</p>
                     <p>It was with breathless, feverish curiosity that Prosper listened to the
                        foregoing, whose every word almost illumined events with a new light. He
                        explained, he fancied, the scrap of Gipsy's letter. The young Southerner,
                        who had been in all his secrets, was a downright scoundrel. A number of
                        unnoticed circumstances now rushed upon him, and he marveled how he could
                        have been blind so long.</p>
                     <p>"After dinner yesterday, six o'clock, you know," resumed Joseph, "my master
                        fixed himself up like going to see Brown of Grace Church. I 'lathered and
                        shaved' him, and filagreed him up. Then I drove him in our turn-out to the
                        pair of roans, to Mr. V. K. s house——"</p>
                     <p>"What?" broke in Roadside, "after his insulting words on the day of the
                        robbery, he is so impudent as to go there?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, sir! He had quite enough impudence for that, and to stay there all the
                        evening, too, for I was caught in the rain and, though I saved myself in the
                        billiard-room at the corner, my bags were so aked like sponges."</p>
                     <p>"How did he look, coming out?" questioned Mr. Sharpson.</p>
                     <p>"Less delighted than when he went in. When we got home, and I opened the
                        door to him and asked him whether he was done with the horses for the night,
                        he jumped out like a jack-in-a-box, and damned me for a race-betting,
                        horse-hair, ingeing, dog-fancying galoot!"</p>
                     <p>Ketchem twitched his ragged ears and growled at the last adjective in the
                        three-fold insult, while his master slowly drank his whisky as if to aid him
                        in digesting the same.</p>
                     <p>"Is that all?" inquired the Westerner.</p>
                     <p>"All for yesterday. This morning he wasn't down to breakfast; and when he
                        did get up to attend to the ham and eggs I took up to him, he was in a dog's
                        own humor. At twelve the youngster arrived, excusing himself because the
                        Hunter's Point ferry-boat had made a long passage on account or the
                        tide——"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, he's got a house in Astoria," said Roadside. "He often comes that
                        way."</p>
                     <p>"He was in a fury himself, anyway. Of course they fell to
                        wrangling—quarreling—mussing; gutter-snipes would have blushed to see and
                        hear them! One time my Colonel grabbed the junior by the throat, pinned him
                        against the wall like my dog might, and then shook him like a cherry-tree
                        with hookey-playing boys on every bough. I thought he was going to leave him
                        for dead. But B. C. knew his A. B. C's, I guess, for he whipped out of the
                        back of his coat, Bowie-fashion, a pretty little pointed knife, and the
                        Jersey giant let him as quick as he saw it! He cooled down, like soda-water
                        left to stand."</p>
                     <p>"But what did they <emph>say?</emph>"</p>
                     <p>"That's where the drag was put on," whined Joseph. "They spoke French, blast
                        'em—good French, too good for me to understand them. I know creowl French a
                        little, but theirs stumped me. Anyhow, I'm sure they talked 'money.' for
                           '<foreign xml:lang="FRA">de l'argent,</foreign>' and '<foreign
                           xml:lang="FRA">sans argent,</foreign>' and '<foreign xml:lang="FRA">a
                           propos d'argent,</foreign>' was sprinkled all over their debate."</p>
                     <p>With frowning brows, the red-whiskered man mumbled an unintelligible
                        monologue, and Prosper, who watched him, wondered if by chance he had the
                        audacity to try to reconstruct, by sheer dint of supposition, the
                        disputation which the servant had not understood.</p>
                     <p>"To conclude," said Joseph, "finishing his tumbler, and whirling it so that
                        the last few drops should lick up the unmelted sugar; "when my beauties
                        calmed down, they talked English again. But, hang it! they only spoke of
                        stuff, such as Laurence Mathers' big fancy dress-ball to come off soon. But,
                        at the end, my master told the young fellow: 'As this spat must come off
                        some time or other, let it be to-night! So, stay you home this evening!' 'I
                        don't care,' said B. C."</p>
                     <p>"That's all?"</p>
                     <p>"No more," said Joseph, letting the sugared drops roll down out upon his
                        tongue with satisfaction.</p>
                     <p>"Cut, then!" said the Western man, "perhaps your master may want you, and
                        anyhow here's some one to speak to me. Get you gone, till to-morrow, old
                        boy!"</p>
                     <p>Joe tucked his whip under his arm, collared the neck of the decanter to
                        return it to the bar, whistled, and his dog lazily rose, and after winking
                        at Dominick, who chuckled at some unknown joke he saw in Joseph's boots,
                        departed as horsily as he had strolled in.</p>
                     <p>The new comer who had arrived was no other than the Jerry, servant at Van
                        Kieft's residence, whose acquaintance Jacob Hall had so fruitlessly made.
                        Roadside recognized him at once; he was an elderly man now, as full of
                        trembling as a human being could well be without chattering to pieces. He
                        looked around him on every side, worse than a young pick-pocket suspecting
                        to be tapped on the shoulder at any instant. He bowed to Roadside very
                        furtively, and not till he was quite sure no one of the bystanders were
                        looking at him did he<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC8328-00000023"/> risk the
                        handing of a small note to Mr. Sharpson, saying:</p>
                     <p>"The note is from Mr. Lucas. The paper was one of a lot locked up in missus'

                     <p>Sharpson unrolled the packet, an enveloped note and a small-sized newspaper,
                        such as was published in towns a score years ago, and now as our backwoods
                        villages are blessed with.</p>
                     <p>It was riddled, so to say, by many small holes, denoting the absence of such
                        letters and words as had been abstracted to form the curious letter sent to
                        Roadside.</p>
                     <p>"By heaven?" cried he.</p>

                        folding up the paper, "the rest on the pile must be interesting!"</p>
                     <p>He gave the newspaper back to Jerry.</p>
                     <p>"Make Jane put it back where she got it from, I'm afraid it is saved as a
                        precious thing, and may be missed. Do you want your money now?"</p>
                     <p>"No, no, sir. But is there any answer to the note?"</p>
                     <p>"From Mr. Lucas? Oh, I forgot."</p>
                     <p>He glanced at the letter, but, shaking his head, tossed it to Roadside, and
                        rose.</p>
                     <p>"Go, my man," said he to Jerry, "for here's somebody to speak to me."</p>
                     <p>As Jerry left the saloon, a ragged boy, who had been riding on the doorstep
                        of a stage, came down the doorsteps, taking them all in his flying leap.</p>

                        I'd better give it up. He's too much for me!"</p>
                     <p>The ragged boy, about to speak to Dominick, was checked by seeing the
                        Western man stand up, and running to him, he said:</p>
                     <p>"Off, sir! and Mr. L. gave this just before the carriage went."</p>
                     <p>Sharpson took a note, disregarding the dirty thumb-marks left by the bearer,
                        and ran his eyes over the contents.</p>
                     <p>"Astoria!" muttered he, "'perhaps' be hanged—it's so!"</p>
                     <p>He put two half dollars in the boy's hand, and said to him: "There—you're
                        free to-day. Behave yourself at the Old Bowery!"</p>
                     <p>The boy laughed and vanished without more ado.</p>
                     <p>As before, Sharpson tossed this note to his young companion, and then,
                        drawing near to the bar, set to examining a map of New York City and
                        environs which adorned the wall.</p>

                     <p>"Yes. Come, my friend!"</p>
                     <p>And taking Prosper's arm, he drew him out of the oyster-rooms.</p>
                     <p>It was five o'clock, dull and cloudy, promising rain. In an hour it would be
                        dark.</p>
                     <p>"I'm afraid we'll be late," said Mr. Sharpson, stopping on the curbstone.
                        "Answer, quick. Do you know Burnett Clanmoran's house in Astoria, you
                        say?"</p>
                     <p>"Ah! I see. Oh, yes. On Flushing avenue, just past the church, where the new

                        BURNETT.</head>
                     <p>Prosper and his friend crossed to the Bowery, and as Mr. Sharpson appeared
                        to have expected, they found the rails almost without a break covered by the
                        long Harlem and New Haven cars, drawn by four horses, to reach the depot
                        where they change off for steam power.</p>
                     <p>"Do as I do," said Sharpson, who, with more activity than his figure spoke
                        of, ran to the track and climbed up by the brake-frame to the front platform
                        of a baggage-car, though going at more than a sharp pace. Prosper mounted
                        like wise.</p>
                     <p>His leader opened his note-book and out of its pocket produced a card,
                        which, or the mere signature written on it, seemed to satisfy the driver
                        that he had a right to use the N. Y. and H. R. R. cars. They are a
                        neighborly set of men, any how, and let a sociable stranger ride for nothing
                        many a time.</p>
                     <p>"We'll catch the 5:40, won't we?" asked Sharnson, looking at his watch.</p>
                     <p>"Sure," said the driver smiling, and pocketing the cigar the Westerner had
                        made it a specialty to give him; "this car has got to make it up, and we're
                        late a little!"</p>
                     <p>"Who's the engineer to it to-day, d'ye know?"</p>
                     <p>"Why I think English Jem has the turn: the new engine from our works—seen
                        her yet? number 173, to replace the one that rolled down the embankment by
                        Seventy-second street. She isn't named yet. A beauty, I tell you. On her
                        trial trip she drew an everlasting string of marble and cattle cars—you'd
                        have thought she was bringing a whole Westchester quarry and all the West
                        Farms cattle into town! Are you going out of town, sir? Going to be an awful
                        wet night!"</p>
                     <p>"I think so myself. But we can't all have our own way! or perhaps you'd
                        drive a four-in-hand in a different fashion, eh?"</p>
                     <p>The driver laughed, and let out his long whip in a style that would have
                        made an Australian stockman wish to take lessons. All was hurry along the up
                        track; for the storm that threatened was so black that the most tanned of
                        skins would have preferred to hasten rather than linger to meet it.</p>
                     <p>In less than half an hour the cars had reached the Twenty-eighth street
                        depot, where some switched off, others going on almost into the mouth of the
                        tunnel. Engines were shrieking tremulously, as if the black clouds above and
                        a slight premonitory shower had caused them fear.</p>
                     <p>Sharpson asked a question or two of the men hanging round the turn-table
                        shed, and then dragged Prosper away into a clothing-store opposite, where he
                        purchased two oil-cloth capes and two glazed caps. The gentlemen left their
                        stove-pipe hats to be sent to the Old Pear Tree.</p>
                     <p>When they came out, Sharpson instantly crossed over, had a short chat with a
                        sort of superintendent who seemed to know him after a while; and this person
                        introduced him and Prosper to an engineer, who turned out to be Mr. "English
                        Jem."</p>
                     <p>Sharpson "made it all right" with him that he should receive them on the
                        locomotive.</p>
                     <p>"No fear," said Jem, good-humoredly, as they came out of the hotel where
                        they had made the little arrangement, to go to the engine; "no fear of any
                        of the directors being on the spy to-night."</p>
                     <p>The sky had become, three-parts of it, an intense and dreary leaden hue. The
                        other quarter was an inky pale, which slower and slower widening and coming
                        forward, was the foil to scintillations of lightning, feeble at first, but
                        more vivid each flash.</p>
                     <p>They walked around the locomotive, a noble sample of the machine, as it
                        waited for the forming of the train, a few yards in advance of the head
                        baggage car.</p>
                     <p>"A beauty, I tell ye, gentlemen!" said Jem, enthusiastically. "The engines
                        we drive on the English plates are pocket affairs to the like of this. When
                        I first come over here from driving on the Chatham and Dover, the engines
                        felt too big for me! like a man who had his hand in on ponies first giving a
                        dray-horse its head. Well, walk into my parlor. Quite a room, you see,
                        sir!"</p>
                     <p>They all mounted into the cab of the engine.</p>
                     <p>"Now, in Britain, if you'll believe it, the engine-driver has no shelter
                        against such a storm as that coming on, except a board, as it were, flat up
                        at the end of the boiler. No more use! Here, not a drop will fall on us, and
                        we have room for my fireman, too. My fireman, Tom, gentlemen. Tom, some
                        friends of mine. No sir," said he to Sharpson, "he don't drink, no more'n
                        me. You saw I only took ale. I wouldn't undertake such a train as this
                        engine draws, if my stoker drank. Afraid to!" Thereupon the locomotive
                        backed, and the musical ratile of the coupling pins falling into place was
                        heard down the long line, like "firing at will."</p>
                     <p>In a few seconds more the whole had started.</p>
                     <p>"I won't forget, sir, to slacken speed when past Ninety-Sixth street.
                        There's an old tree by one telegraph post that I suppose can be seen if we
                        don't beat the rain up. It does hold off, to be sure."</p>
                     <p>Prosper looked his bew lderment, and Sharpson smiled at him, on the mention
                        of Ninety-Sixth street overthrowing his little theory.</p>
                     <p>"I'll tell you, my young friend,'" said the Westerner, as the two were
                        squatted side by side against the right-hand side of the engine-shelter, out
                        of the way of the shut-off lever, while the wind rushed by with a fearful
                        sound, "I'll tell you my idea. You know as much as I do. Burnett stays at
                        home in Astoria to expect somebody for a 'spat.' A woman, perhaps, seeing
                        that men <emph>fight,</emph> not have spats or tiffs. Again, a lady leaves
                        Mr. Van Kieft's in a carriage for Astoria——"</p>
                     <p>"Mrs. Van Kieft?"</p>
                     <p>"Burnett's her relation, so I reckon so. Well, she is now going naturally to
                        cross by Hunter's Point Ferry; takes the cross-road, and, as Van Kiefts are
                        good, she will get to Burnett's, spite of the storm, about 11 o'clock. We'd
                        be much behind her, if we went the same route. Now, I propose to go up to
                        One Hundred and Sixth street and cross. Ah! stop, I see your objection.
                        Eighty-sixth street is opposite Hallet's Cove, and there's plenty of boats
                        there. But this storm! and the tide! running out in an hour's time. It'll
                        sweep the Blackwell's Island barge down to the Fishing Rocks in no time.
                        We'll shoot out from One Hundred and Fifth or so, and out across the river
                        just where we want to go! Oh, but any boatman would row up stream in the
                        backwater and then cut over? Ay, but that's time lost, which we shall gain.
                        You may conclude that the banker's horses ain't going at a pace like
                        this."</p>
                     <p>Two heavy showers had passed. The storm came from seaward, and was crossing
                        Long and Manhattan Islands in a south-western direction. The lamp of the
                        locomotive cast its rays far ahead on the iron threads and brown sleepers
                        and gravel glistening with wet.</p>
                     <p>Tom had gone to sleep in the tender. Jem did all the watching. Once the
                        conductor had come forward to have a chat with him, and Jem again cautioned
                        him not to mind his slowing the train in a few minutes.</p>
                     <p>At last, Jem turned to his guests.</p>
                     <p>"We're pretty near it, sir; I <emph>could</emph> stop in the length of two
                        of these long blocks, but I'll take four to slacken and give you time. The
                        wet's made the footing bad."</p>
                     <p>"All right; 'tend to your cut-off. I'll post my friend Prosper," said
                        Sharpson. "It's very simple; jump ahead with the movement, and only remember
                        if you stumble to roll out. Better a tumble down the bank than a leg cut
                        off. I'll take the track side. There's no train expected, Jem?"</p>
                     <p>"No, sir;" none due this quarter-hour."</p>
                     <p>Prosper and his friend stood each in one sideway.</p>
                     <p>It was the lull between two showers, but it was very dark, and the flashes
                        of lightning made the whitewash dabs on large stones and the telegraph posts
                        strangely prominent in the gloom. The thunder peals blended with the
                        jerking, bumping motion of the cars and the rushing of the wind and the
                        rain, rendered the hand-rails full of moisture to the touch.</p>
                     <p>The train perceptibly lost motion.</p>
                     <p>Presently: "Now, gentlemen, I've her steady, so! Soon as you like! Pull your
                        caps down!"</p>
                     <p>Sharpson leaped forward, close to the side of the driving-wheel, as if going
                        to fall under, but safely landed by the rail of the down track. Roadside,
                        equally agile, jumped to the ground as safely, but round himself more shaken
                        than he had expected.</p>
                     <p>"All right!" shouted they, as an answering call arose, and the almost
                        endless train, in a veil of smoke and drizzle, rushed between them.</p>
                     <p>In two minutes the lantern dangling at the brake-railing of the last car
                        shot away into the darkness with incredible swiftness.</p>
                     <p>Their ears having lost a little of the tingling, and the blood, shaken up
                        too vigorously, running placidly again, the two men paused on the edge of
                        the embankment to take their bearings.</p>
                     <p>In a moment, the Westerner had traced the lines.</p>
                     <p>"That's One Hundred and Fourth street just below us," said he, and that
                        string of far-apart lights is One Hundred and Fifth. That's the place. Tuck
                        your pants in your boots, get your cape on, and off we go."</p>
                     <p>They easily, but at some risk, climbed down<pb n="46-47"
                           xml:id="VAC8328-00000024"/> the slope of stones and rubbish, forming the
                        railroad made ground, and had then to cross some grass land to reach the
                        Third avenue.</p>
                     <p>"Lucky the rain's come," said Sharpson, genially; "none of those confounded
                        cow-dogs will be barking at us.</p>
                     <p>At a good pace, they went straight down the new cuttings of the first street
                        toward the East river.</p>
                     <p>A narrow creek, crossing two blocks in space, ran in toward One Hundred and
                        Fifth street. A house stands there, a shanty, with a boat-shed over the
                        water. A dog, whose hoarse bark proved him to be of large size, began to
                        roar dreadfully as the two men splashed through the open ground up toward
                        the building.</p>
                     <p>"The brute's chained up," said Sharpson, "seeing that he keeps always in the
                        same place. But pick up a rock, anyhow. If the old man's not at some, we'll
                        have to steal the boat, and the dog may be troublesome."</p>
                     <p>The Westerner announced his felonious intention in a very matter-of-fact
                        tone, but the rain took all desire for nonsensical questioning out of the
                        young man.</p>
                     <p>"No smoke out of the funnel; no light," said his leader. "No answer to the
                        knock. The old rascal's gone up on the avenue to snooze in some saloon.
                        Prosper, go round to the back of the shanty; hit the dog in the ribs with a
                        stone—you can't hurt him bad—he's a tough fighter—and swear at him. Stop his
                        riot! I must open the door to get the oars. The old rascal wouldn't leave
                        them in the boat."</p>
                     <p>He pulled out a large-sized jack-knife as he spoke, and one of the blades—if
                        this is allowable—was a picklock. He opened the door, walked in, lit a match
                        from his cigar-case, and looked around.</p>
                     <p>A bed in one corner was empty. Overhead, on two slats, a dozen oars, sculls,
                        and a mast with sails round it, were placed.</p>
                     <p>Sharpson threw the match into the little stoves mouth, and, by feel alone,
                        picked out two pairs of oars. With these under his arm he left the shanty,
                        the door of which he carefully locked behind him.</p>
                     <p>Roadside had circumnavigated the building.</p>
                     <p>"The dog's a big one, sir," said he; "he's growling, but I stopped his
                        barking."</p>
                     <p>"On, growling won't be heard on the avenue. All right; I've got the oars. Is
                        the boat-house locked?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes; padlocks to it and the boat-painters."</p>
                     <p>"Padlocks are less than nothing. Heave another stone at the doghouse to keep
                        the beast quiet, while I——it is open to my touch: let us in. Come on."</p>
                     <p>They entered the boathouse, a sort of loft over the water, in which two
                        boats and a "dinky" floated inside from the rain.</p>
                     <p>"We'll take the blue one," said Sharpson, as calmly as if he owned the
                        fleet.</p>
                     <p>Prosper lowered himself down into the boat. The oars were handed to him, and
                        the Westerner followed.</p>
                     <p>The thunder roared louder than ever; the sky was incessantly furrowed with
                        fiery ploughshares, and the rain came down in masses.</p>
                     <p>"Sure you can swim?" said Sharpson abruptly, and as <unclear>if
                           ill</unclear> at ease.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, yes."</p>
                     <p>"Fit your oars; take the tholepins out of the other boat."</p>
                     <p>"In for a lamb, in for a sheep!" muttered Prosper.</p>
                     <p>"Oat we go!"</p>
                     <p>The boat went swiftly from under the house and oashed down the stream.</p>
                     <p>The East river was a fearful sight. Lashed by the rain till its surface was
                        covered with a smoky froth, the current rushing past Ward's Island, and
                        widening before it piled up the froth on the Mill Rocks and Niggerhead; and
                        the backwater, full of sticks and drift, racing up against the channel flood
                        to each foam-edged point, it seemed right that not a thing speaking of man
                        should be upon the surface as far as the eye could reach.</p>
                     <p>The weather, detestable enough five minutes before, seemed double in
                        hatefulness, as they pushed out of the inlet into the open. Luckily their
                        backs were to the wind.</p>
                     <p>Sharpson rowed, as he did everything else, as if he had served an
                        apprenticeship to it, and Roadside pulled fairly enough save for the usual
                        amateur weakness of the left hand. Before them the sheets of rain prevented
                        anything being seen. A sort of lurid stationary shadow with innumerable eyes
                        behind them on the right was one of the Ward's Island buildings, with its
                        window-lights.</p>
                     <p>After going up a few yards in the backwater, the boat was pulled into the
                        current, and, rocking furiously, it was instantly whirled along in the
                        reversed direction.</p>
                     <p>They pulled hard, one with his will, the other with his heart, perhaps, in
                        the task.</p>
                     <p>The boat kept dancing so as to bother the blades, and to prove that Sharpson
                        had been right not to undertake so dangerous a passage unless his companion
                        had that "one chance more" for life which swimming gives.</p>
                     <p>However, with three inches of water under the foot-board, and themselves
                        drenched as much with spray as fresh water, they reached and cut through the
                        broken water below flood Rock, and then proceeded toward the shore vaguely
                        discernible.</p>
                     <p>They were right glad, one as much as the other, when they shot, with the
                        last three hearty pulls, into the still water round the bend forming
                        Hallet's Cove, and the lights flashed through the rain.</p>
                     <p>They found the bulkhead quite deserted. They pulled up to the nearest pier,
                        and tied up the boat. They had to climb up the slimy logs, so much had the
                        tide fallen already.</p>
                     <p>"We must change our clothes first thing," observed Sharpson, glancing at his
                        watch at the first lamp-post "It's six, eight minutes past seven. We've
                        gained a good hour by our bid for sore throat! Come on, we must be
                        moving."</p>
                     <p>Up Flushing avenue they tramped, their wet clothes clinging to them so as to
                        impede their movements: they were so full of rain that no more would come
                        through them.</p>
                     <p>At last Sharpson spied the policeman he had been looking for. Crossing over
                        to him, he found out the shortest cut to the police-station. There he and
                        Prosper found a refuse.</p>
                     <p>Surprises had almost ceased to be sensations to the latter, and yet he was a
                        little astounded at seeing how eagerly the captain on night duty greeted his
                        guide. After a private introduction card had been shown and more information
                        given, clothes were found for them, dry and thick, if not fashionable or
                        well-fitting, and, each in a pair of such high pull-up boots as the Newtown
                        Creekers use in crabbing, the two men were in excellent trim to face the
                        storm again.</p>
                     <p>"If you should want any assistance," said the captain, actually leaving his
                        railed desk to see them to the door, "just fire off a pistol-shot. Mr. Mason
                        is going off in half an hour on the inspection round, and he'll put all on
                        the beats that way to turn up to lending you a hand."</p>
                     <p>"Thank'ee. But I hope we'd get through it quiet. By the way, if you ever get
                        an off-day, you know, you must look me up."</p>
                     <p>"I will!"</p>
                     <p>"Good night."</p>
                     <p>"Night."</p>
                     <p>For some five minutes more the two men felt all the joyous boldness of
                        having dry clothes upon them but at the end of that period the continuous
                        downfall not only took that presuming good humor out of them, but set to
                        work to reduce their proud array to the same state of pulp as it had left
                        their former garb.</p>
                     <p>After several turns, Roadside, now the leader, stopped.</p>
                     <p>"Look!" said he, "there's the carriage already here. I know it by the silver
                        lamps!"</p>
                     <p>"Impossible!"</p>
                     <p>Nevertheless, up a lane, rather than a street, on one side, near the white
                        fence of a rather large house, a vehicle was certainly drawn up. The reins
                        led from the smoking and mud-splashed horses through the little front slide
                        under the driver's seat into the interior.</p>
                     <p>The two approached cautiously.</p>
                     <p>"Stay here!" said Sharpson, going forward to reconnoitre.</p>
                     <p>Then he beckoned for his friend to approach.</p>
                     <p>"The driver's inside—cunning dog, and asleep!"</p>
                     <p>Prosper looked and started.</p>
                     <p>"It is Lucas! Lucas Van Kieft," cried he.</p>
                     <p>"Hush! Lucas! the devil! Is this his sudden idea, so as to tell me where the
                        lady was going?" muttered Sharpson. "He <emph>is</emph> a weak attempt at
                        humanity! Let him sleep, then! We're all right, so far. They must have gone
                        at full split, caught a ferryboat just leaving, crossed quick where the tide
                        was dead, on the turn, and, the horses being rested on the boat, come on
                        like the devil here! Thunder! only we delayed to change our clothes,
                        useless, for we're soaked now, we'd have been here nearly as quick as
                        them!"</p>
                     <p>They deemed it imprudent to attempt an entrance at the front gate. They
                        skirted the walls of the garden, it being a detached house.</p>
                     <p>It was not easy to find a place facile for scaling, it being ten or twelve
                        feet high, a precaution quite natural against the Newtown fruit thieves, the
                        terror of Winfield and New Lots. However, in the waste land surrounding,
                        there were several stones which they rolled to the wall. Then, finding that
                        pikes and broken bottles had not been liberally arranged on the coping, the
                        Westerner drew back a few steps, took a run up on the stones, and, leaping,
                        succeeded in getting the hold he required to vault up on the top-stone. A
                        prodigious teat for a man of his build. He had but to sling one leg over to
                        be astride.</p>
                     <p>Prosper took his turn at it, but though younger, he had not his companion's
                        strength, and he was glad to have a lift up.</p>
                     <p>They dropped down inside.</p>
                     <p>"No dog!" said Sharpson in a pleased tone. "So much the better."</p>
                     <p>The house stood in the middle of its lot. It was narrow, and two stories and
                        an attic high. All was black, except one window on the second floor, through
                        the shade of which light streamed dreamily forth.</p>
                     <p>Happily, this was to the north-east, and the pair of intruders were somewhat
                        sheltered from the wind.</p>
                     <p>"You know the house from having been here," remarked Sharpson; "tell me what
                        room is that light in?"</p>
                     <p>"Burnett's bedroom, it must be."</p>
                     <p>"Very well. What is the ground floor?"</p>
                     <p>"Kitchen and cellar, first floor, parlor and sitting-room, with a
                        billiard-table in it. Upstairs, small rooms and the bedroom. Attic, not
                        used, number rooms, guns and fishing tackle."</p>
                     <p>"Where do the servants stay?"</p>
                     <p>"Burnett has none till Summer. There's some old woman living near here, who
                        comes to clean up and look after the house, twice a week."</p>
                     <p>Sharpson rubbed his hands in pleasure.</p>
                     <p>"Very pretty!" chuckled he; "spite of that sleepy head, Van Kieft's hopeful,
                        I think we will make something out of it. Now, then, picklock, we'll walk
                        in!"</p>
                     <p>Roadside shook his head, it had come to burglary, "flat burglary," now?</p>
                     <p>"I don't like to remonstrate," said he, "but really!—though I said nothing
                        about the boat!"</p>
                     <p>The Westerner laughed.</p>
                     <p>"You are a pretty sick man to be vexed by flies on the bed-quilt!" sneered
                        he. "Do you know that the owner of that skiff makes his living by smuggling
                        liquor and tobacco to the keepers, and helping prisoners to escape off the
                        islands! Do you want to take around the hat for him? He'll get the boat back
                        sometime tomorrow by a policeman's hands, and he'll be honest for a whole
                        week on the strength of the start! Why. it's a laudable act! hooking his
                        boat is!"</p>
                     <p>"But we'll be discovered!"</p>
                     <p>"What of that! Upon the least noise betraying our presence, of course you
                        walk forward like a friend visiting a friend, who found all the doors
                        accidentally left open." The "block" to this was that the door was more than
                        locked. A bar was fastened besides. In vain did Mr. Sharpson try to open it.
                        He picked the lock, but the bar held.</p>
                     <p>"If it was only a bolt now!" he muttered; "could cut that with my little
                        file-saw, but I haven't a center-bit on me! Curse this little gimblet—more
                        like a corkscrew than any thing else. If I only had my other manyblades
                        along with me! Another lesson, never to go out without tools!'</p>
                     <p>He seemed exasperated. He walked around the house like a fox around a
                        hen-house, furious at finding no loop-hole. In desperation he retired to a
                        flower-bed, from which he could best view the lighted window.</p>
                     <p>"If only a man could see!" he said. "Only to think that there, there"—he
                        shook his fist at the casement—"there is the answer to the puzzle, and only
                        thirty or forty feet from us!"</p>
                     <p>Prosper had fancied that he was a new Faust with the old original
                        Mephistopheles by his side, but the Prince of Darkness began to have more of
                        the air of a first-rate cracksman. His bearing very much amazed him. He
                        seemed to be on his own property in this garden, into which he had entered
                        by escalade; he walked about quite at ease, as if accustomed to such
                        nocturnal expeditions; he found the stillness quite natural; he spoke of
                        breaking into a house as another man does of getting the kernel out of a
                        hickory nut. Besides, he was as insensible as a fish to the wet, as a stone
                        to the wind, as a worm to the mud in which he paddled. He came again to the
                        house, measured distance as if he had some notion of gliding up the
                        face.</p>
                     <p>"I want to see, and I'm bound to see," he muttered. "Why don't the too-foo
                        have a grapevine, up whose frame a fellow could climb!"</p>
                     <p>That put a thought in the listener's head.</p>
                     <p>"I used to see a ladder kicking about here somewhere," said he.</p>
                     <p>"And you never told me! Where, where!"</p>
                     <p>"Under the trees, beyond."</p>
                     <p>They ran to the end of the garden and, not without difficulty, found it half
                        buried in morning-glories and long grass. To carry it to the house and set
                        it up was an instant's work. But, that done, they discovered that even when
                        placed more vertically than prudence permitted, some six feet yet was
                        lacking to reach the lighted window.</p>
                     <p>"We'll never do it," groaned Prosper, discouraged.</p>
                     <p>"Chief Charley of San Fran.!" said Sharpson, suddenly and triumphantly. "Won
                        t we? I rather think we will!"</p>
                     <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC8328-00000025"/>
                     <p>Whereupon, standing half a yard out from the wall, facing it, he seized the
                        ladder, raised it, and set the two ends of the sides on his shoulders, the
                        last spar just above his head. Holding it firmly, the obstacle was
                        overcome.</p>
                     <p>"Kick a <emph>little</emph> of the mud off your boots," said he to his
                        companion, "and up you go!"</p>
                     <p>It was a momentous task for the young man, but he did not hesitate. The
                        enthusiasm of the bindrance destroyed and the hope of triumph gave him
                        strength and nimbleness beyond what he had ever known. Without roughness, he
                        climbed up to the lower rungs, and was soon mounting the twenty-four-foot
                        ladder, but little shaking under him. But his head had barely risen above
                        the window-sill when he uttered a heart-breaking sob—carried away by a
                        simultaneous rush of the stormy wind—and slid, or rather fell along the
                        ladder to the ground, gasping:</p>
                     <p>"The wretch! the wretched thing!"</p>
                     <p>With extraordinary quickness and alertness, the other lowered the ladder and
                        lifted up Roadside, fearing that he had been severely hurt.</p>
                     <p>"What ails you? What was it?" he inquired.</p>
                     <p>But Prosper sprang up in a moment. If the all had been hard, still he was in
                        one of those moods when the mind so absolutely lords it over the body that
                        pain is a thing unknown.</p>
                     <p>"Viandra is there!" said he. "Viandra—alone—with Burnett!"</p>
                     <p>Sharpson was off the track! He, so full of unfailing logic, had been utterly
                        deceived. He knew wed that some woman was with the Southerner, but, after
                        his conjectures, after Lucas Van Kieft's messages to him, he believed that
                        the woman was Mrs. Van Kieft.</p>
                     <p>"No mistaking?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh, no, sir! She is not dressed as I often saw her, but I cannot mistake
                        any other woman for her. Now, you, who heard her yesterday, answer me: ought
                        I to expect such shameful treachery? You said: 'She loves you, she loves
                        you!'"</p>
                     <p>No reply from the other. Confounded by his error at first, he was hastening
                        back to the causes, and already his inventive mind began to ferret them
                        out.</p>
                     <p>"No wonder Gypsy looked at me so pityingly!" moaned the cashier. "My pure
                        and noble Madeline is this scoundrel's mistress—a fellow who has stolen the
                        very name he bears. And I, fool of an honest man, made this false wretch my
                        bosom friend! To him I confided my hopes and fears—and he was her lover all
                        the white. No doubt, I was their laughing-stock; they make merry at their
                        interviews of my nonsensical love, my stupid trust! But there's been quite
                        enough of it! No one shall say that I cowardly let such insults pass!"</p>
                     <p>But Sharpson caught him by the arm.</p>
                     <p>"What now?"</p>
                     <p>"I mean to avenge myself! Now, I'll break in the door, not afraid of noise
                        or of the scandal! I won't steal in, but enter to take the villain out by
                        the throat!"</p>
                     <p>"No, you'll not, Prosper."</p>
                     <p>"I'd like to see who'll prevent me?"</p>
                     <p>"I will!"</p>
                     <p>"You? No, let go! I'll face 'em, I'll kill 'em! and then, then die after
                        them, perhaps!"</p>
                     <p>If the other had not been gifted with great power of grip, the young man
                        would have burst from him. There was a short wrestle between them, but the
                        elder won.</p>
                     <p>"If you make any noise, you'll alarm them," said he, "and all's over with
                        our hope——"</p>
                     <p>"I've no hope now.'</p>
                     <p>"Burnett, once on his guard, will escape us, and you'll only lose him and
                        the girl——"</p>
                     <p>"What matters that to me?"</p>
                     <p>"It matters to <emph>me,</emph> you crazy boy! I've promised to get you
                        clear! Do you forget you were in jail a week ago? At your age you can find
                        plenty of girls to love, but good repute is not found twice in a life!"</p>
                     <p>When real passions are raging, other feelings have no weight. There stood
                        two men, drowned by rain, drenched to the bone and ankle deep in mud, and
                        yet they were arguing!</p>
                     <p>"I must have my revenge!" repeated the young man, with the idiotic
                        persistency of a fixed idea.</p>
                     <p>"Have as much as you like!" said Sharpson, getting chafed himself; "but,
                        like a man, not like a boy!"</p>
                     <p>"Boy!"</p>
                     <p>"'Boy,' I said, and say! What would you do, once in the house? Have you
                        weapons? No! You may be sure the other has. Suppose you do grapple him?
                        Well, the young lady will make off and reach her carriage meanwhile."</p>
                     <p>"I saw your revolver when we changed clothes," said Prosper; "or your knife;
                        give me something that will kill!"</p>
                     <p>"You are daft!" sneered the elder man; "get hung for a rogue who can be sent
                        to Sing Sing!"</p>
                     <p>Prosper was snaken. So guessed the Westerner, for he launched his final
                        argument, the one he had held in reserve.</p>
                     <p>"Beside," said he, "what assures us Miss Oestervelt <emph>is</emph> on
                           <emph>his</emph> side? Did we not come to the conclusion that she was
                        sacrificing herself? The superior law which governs her may have forced her
                        to come here this night."</p>
                     <p>The voice which speaks for our dearest desires will always be listened to.
                        Prosper was affected by the far from probable surmise.</p>
                     <p>"Indeed, who can say?" he muttered.</p>
                     <p>"I might say, if I had seen, or should see."</p>
                     <p>"Will you promise, sir," said Prosper, alter a moment passing, "to tell me
                        your whole idea, the truth, however painful to me?"</p>
                     <p>"On my word and honor."</p>
                     <p>Upon this, with a strength of which he was not capable a few minutes before,
                        Prosper caught up the ladder and held it as his befriender had done, except
                        that the last rung rested across upon his shoulders, with his head bowed
                        forward. He doubted his ability to support the weight on the collar-bone and
                        shoulder muscles, as the former had done.</p>
                     <p>In a second, so lightly and adroitly that the ladder was not shaken, Mr.
                        Sharpson went up to the top.</p>
                     <p>Prosper had seen quite clearly under the bottom of the shade. It was Miss
                        Oestervelt who was there, at that hour, alone with Burnett Clanmoran.
                        Sharpson remarked that she had all her attire on—all the outer-dress—as was
                        proven by the shining raindrops still upon her bonnet and mantle, received
                        in coming from the carriage to the house.</p>
                     <p>Standing in the middle of the room, she was speaking with great animation.
                        By her attitude, her gestures and her face, were betrayed deep indignation,
                        hardly kept down and badly disguised contempt.</p>
                     <p>Burnett, sitting on the low iron bed, with a cigar in his mouth, had let the
                        light go out, and was chewing the end in an angry way, as much as to say, "I
                        have got to hear the young fool to the end of the chapter, and I only wish
                        she'd come to the lastly, and be done with it!"</p>
                     <p>Undoubtedly Mr. Sharpson would have given the pretty ring he wore on his
                        left middle finger to hear any ten words of the colloquy; but the wind was
                        so high that the vaguest murmur alone came to his ear, and he was afraid to
                        bring his face nearer the glass, where the light might fall on it.</p>
                     <p>"It's some dispute," thought he; "but no love at the bottom of it, I'll be
                        bound."</p>
                     <p>Viandra continued, and by studying Burnett's face, well lighted as it was by
                        the astial lamp on a table against the wall, he hoped to pierce into the
                        meaning of the scene.</p>
                     <p>Betimes, Clanmoran started, despite all his apparent indifference, or else
                        he ground his feet on the carpet. Without doubt, some reproach had stung
                        him.</p>
                     <p>In despair, Viandra had come to entreating. With clasped hands she was
                        bending toward him, almost ready to fall on her knees.</p>
                     <p>He turned his head away. If replying, it was only by monosyllables. Two or
                        three times Viandra appeared to be on the verge of going away, but again and
                        again she turned back, as though she could not make up her mind to depart
                        without having obtained what she desired.</p>
                     <p>At the very last she must have used some decisive argument, for suddenly the
                        young man rose, opened a small drawer in the bureau near the fireplace, and
                        took out a bundle of card-slips, which he held out to her.</p>
                     <p>"What the mischief are they up to?" marveled the spy. "Is she asking her
                        love-letters back?"</p>
                     <p>Still, though having this package, the young lady did not seem to be
                        satisfied. Clanmoran refusing, she flung the bundle on the table. It burst,
                        and the separate cards covered it. Now Sharpson could see them better.</p>
                     <p>"If I ain't blind!" he muttered; "they're pawnbroker's duplicates!"</p>
                     <p>Viandra searched among them, selecting three, which she put in her pocket,
                        filliping the others away with very manifest disdain.</p>
                     <p>I his time she was surely going, for upon a word she dropped, Burnett took
                        up the lamp to see her out.</p>
                     <p>Sharpson descended the ladder cautiously, muttering:</p>
                     <p>"Pawnbroker's tickets! What infamous mystery is added to the others in this
                        business?"</p>
                     <p>The two men dragged the ladder, without a thought for the flower-beds, back
                        to where it had lain, and then crept around to the front of the house.</p>
                     <p>Already the rays of the light streamed through the glass over the
                        doorway.</p>
                     <p>"Come quick!" cried Mr. Sharpson. "Don't linger. I've got an idea!"</p>
                     <p>They ran along the path to the outer railing. The gate was locked. But
                        climbing over it was not a hard matter, though a little dangerous, from the
                        spikes on the end of the rails. But Sharpson helped Roadside, so that
                        neither was injured in the act.</p>
                     <p>The rain continued, even more steady than before. The lightning no longer
                        flashed overhead, however, but yellowed the black clouds over the upper end
                        of Manhattan Island.</p>
                     <p>As the two men stood safely in the street the front door of the house
                        opened, and instantly a blast of wind blew out the light held in the
                        Southerner's hand.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheless it could be seen that Clanmoran, on the edge of the portico,
                        offered his hand to his visitor, who repulsed it with a lofty gesture, which
                        would have made Prosper's heart glad, had he but seen it.</p>
                     <p>Viandra was accompanied to the gate by the young man, who unlocked the gate,
                        and then ran into the house, thoroughly wet in that brief space. The young
                        lady walked rapidly to the carriage. The driver, whom she little expected to
                        be her cousin Lucas, was not only startlingly wide awake, but on his
                        box.</p>
                     <p>Viandra entered and shut the door after her.</p>
                     <p>Off started the vehicle, plunging about in the bad road, more like a boat in
                        a swamp than a carriage on what is usually known as dry land. She certainly
                        was too much engaged with her thoughts to notice what the driver, by the
                        increased weight behind him, must have been fully informed of, that two men
                        had jumped <choice>
                           <sic>uopn</sic>
                           <corr>upon</corr>
                        </choice> the tail-board, covered with a board of a fence to render the
                        spikes harmless, and rode thus until the ferry-house was reached, an hour
                        and a half afterward. As no boat was running so early, the lady had to put
                        up at the hotel thereby.</p>
                     <p>Not so Sharpson. He hunted about in the oyster and drinking saloons, and
                        found two men who agreed to take him over in their row-boat. To be sure, the
                        rain gave tokens of abating, and the tide was so low that the current had
                        narrowed and slowed considerably.</p>
                     <p>As the passage was being made, Roadside brought his head close to his
                        companion's, as they sat in the stern-sheets.</p>
                     <p>"Now, sir," said he, "remember that you promised me the truth, whatever it
                        might be. Do not fear to speak. I am strong enough to bear it."</p>
                     <p>"You'd better be fortified against joy, my boy. In a month's time you will
                        bitterly regret your shameful suspicions of this night. You will blush to
                        recall that you ever could have believed that lady dear to this Burnett
                        Clanmoran."</p>
                     <p>"But appearances——"</p>
                     <p>"The very things to be distrusted. Look what we even now make by it! This
                        pair of stout Greenpointers bending to the oars wouldn't have strained a
                        muscle only that they twigged the police clothes, think we are in the force,
                        ha, ha! and that we might have 'spotted' them to hit them hard some day. I
                        picked them out from among a dozen bummers, who are junk and copper stealers
                        about the shipyards over there behind us, I'll be bound. Look here! a false
                        or correct suspicion always sprouts from something, but see to it that it
                        grows from the tree, and not from a toadstool on it.'</p>
                     <p>"But Burnett will know we were there."</p>
                     <p>"By the ladder? Maybe. The rain will wash away our tracks, and maybe the
                        wind will get the credit of playing old gooseberry with the plants. By the
                        bye, what makes this young sport, as fond of woman, old sledge and sin in
                        any shape, as Joe Sproggins himself, settle down out of the world in
                        Astoria?'</p>
                     <p>"So he can talk of his country house! and then it's on nearly a straight
                        road to the Fashion—"</p>
                     <p>"Races? That may do for Summer. But in Winter?"</p>
                     <p>"He keeps altogether in town."</p>
                     <p>That did not seem to enlighten his hearer much, and, during the rest of the
                        transit till their landing below Believue Hospital, Prosper could get
                        nothing more from his strange companion.</p>
                     <p>That set him again against the man who had assumed so perfect a sway over
                        him. Besides, he was cold to the very marrow, and more than half asleep.</p>
                     <p>On landing, they walked up Twenty-eighth street, and down the avenue.</p>
                     <p>It wanted but little of daylight by the time they rang the bell of the Old
                        Pear Tree House, and John let them in.</p>
                     <p>By the time they had put on dry clothes and had entered the office to sit by
                        the fire John had built and kindled, Mrs. Margetson came from her room. She
                        must have had a great respect for Mr. Sharpson, for she showed not the least
                        ill-humor at being aroused so early. Indeed, while a breakfast was being
                        improvised, Prosper noticed that she gazed at his friend with a sort of awed
                        admiration.</p>
                     <p>Roadside then turned in for a long sleep to take the aches out of his
                        bones.</p>
                     <p>That afternoon, Mr. Sharpson came into his room, woke him up and said:</p>
                     <p>"My boy, I am going to go away a few days—about a week or so. The
                        telegraphic dispatches to the papers report great damage to the railroad
                        property all over the States, so that my traveling may take longer than I
                        expect. But<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC8328-00000026"/> I must and will be back
                        for the 29th for Mr. Lawrence Mather's great ball——"</p>
                     <p>Roadside lifted his head off the pillow. What! Mr. Sharpson, the Western
                        trader, a wild-cat bunker, dream of going to a party given by one of the
                        richest capitalists in the city!</p>
                     <p>"Are you invited?" stammered Prosper.</p>
                     <p>"Not yet," said Sharpson, smiling and picking his teeth with his many-bladed
                        pen-knife's smallest blade, "but it's a shovel of mould to a building lot in
                        the Garden City that I jess <emph>will</emph> be!"</p>
                     <p>Oh, contradiction of the human mind? The young man forgot his griefs and
                        sighed to be in the place of him who could go where his dearly beloved was
                        to display her beauty, while the elder, careless of the splendor, was really
                        intent on analyzing the causes of a dark-red stain which prevented him
                        reading what he wished of two villains' chart of life!</p>

                        BITE"—STEEL SPORTED—THE CHASE—THE LAST STRUGGLE.</head>
                     <p>Up the Cooper river, within three hours' walk of the last house of
                        Charleston, on the city side, there was, more than twenty years ago, a
                        somewhat historic building.</p>
                     <p>A rich colonist had built it, a rebel company had held it against the
                        British through two Summer days, and then escaped by their unwearied valor;
                        an English colonel had lodged two London beauties there, who would have been
                        the nearest approach known to angels if their goodness had been on a level
                        with their charms.</p>
                     <p>Later, two generations of the Havilands, of stern Northumbrian stock, had
                        occupied the house and added to the lands of the original estate.</p>
                     <p>In 1841, Mr. Morgan Haviland and his two rons, Girard and Morgan, junior,
                        inhabited the house. Old Haviland had traveled a great deal, but only in the
                        South, and on cotton-planting business. That was his hobby, and, unlike most
                        hobbies, his passion was very profitable.</p>
                     <p>His slaves were treated harshly, but justly on the whole. The boys were left
                        to themselves.</p>
                     <p>The younger took to town-life, and learned every variation he could in
                        dice-throwing and card-play. An old "uncle" had attended to Morgan, and
                        given him a leaning toward hunting, riding and boating.</p>
                     <p>If Morgan was not on a horse he would be found with a gun on his shoulder,
                        or in a scow, pulling up stream to some favorite fishing spot.</p>
                     <p>Old Haviland, trusting to an overseer who had been a boy trained by his
                        father, lived quite happily, eating heartily all kinds of dainties brought
                        by captains of the northern and foreign craft in return for his rough, but
                        generous hospitality; drinking too much, riding out now and then to prevent
                        his paunoby horse getting "stiff in the jints," swearing at the townspeople,
                        and—his great distraction—slandering his nearest neighbor, the widow of
                        Squire Fretberry.</p>
                     <p>What had filled old Haviland with disrelish for that woman's name to be
                        mentioned favorably in his hearing?</p>
                     <p>Even his boys did not rightly know.</p>
                     <p>One party said that she had tried to be the Mrs. Haviland which another had
                        become before she had attracted the rich squire, a man not distinguished
                        except for the unenviable gift of having been attacked by all species of
                        fevers, from the swamp to the sea-coast, from the yellow to the black, one
                        of which had finally mastered him.</p>
                     <p>A second party asserted that it was on Mr. Haviland, after the lady had been
                        widowed, inquiring the figure for a strip of meadow-land adjoining his
                        ground, and receiving the answer that he might join the <emph>whole</emph>
                        of the Fretberry estate to his if he would make the widow his second wife,
                        that the enmity arose.</p>
                     <p>Well, recent or not, in its origin, this hostility was certainly
                        intense.</p>
                     <p>Widow Fretberry had one child, a girl, by her union.</p>
                     <p>The Haviland boys had often played with her when they were young; but when
                        they grew old, such associations were strictly forbidden.</p>
                     <p>Girard was not affected by the command. He found female attraction enough in
                        the town, and never looked at Miss Fretberry, when they did pass on the
                        roads, more than at others or her age and sex.</p>
                     <p>But Morgan, often roaming upon the widow's property, time and again came
                        upon the pretty girl, and love began to fill both their hearts.</p>
                     <p>Fortunately for Morgan, he was of a good temper, and the many little
                        kindnesses he had shown to the negroes on the neighboring plantation induced
                        them to lend him such assistance as no money could have purchased. With all
                        those, who might as easily as not have informed the parents, upon their
                        side, the lovers spent hours of many a sunny afternoon together, gently
                        drifting down the creek in a boat, or seated on the grass at the foot of a
                        tree with the mocking-birds chattering in the trailing moss overhead.</p>
                     <p>With closed eyes, without thought and almost without fears, they continued
                        the dangerous pleasure of seeing one another almost daily. They believed
                        that in them dwelt the whole secret of their love. That the chattering
                        darkeys, sidling off out of their way whenever they met them in the long
                        alleys in the woods, or, perhaps, coming up bashfully (old men though they
                        might be), to <unclear>huce</unclear> "young Massa Habilan' would'nt go fur
                        ter think it unwisedom ob ole unky Ned if he made de remark dat de oberseer

                        'cordinly, prehaps, de young massa and missie would go off dat way from de
                        plantation a lettle furder off?"—that such creatures should have known the
                        youthful pair were but too fond of one another seemed ridiculous to them—yet
                        it was "cabin-talk."</p>
                     <p>They had taken, they took much minute precaution! They watched their own
                        conduct so attentively! They were so deeply persuaded that their bearing had
                        been a masterpiece of prudent dissimulation!</p>
                     <p>Allantina had always lately selected the hours when her mother would not ask
                        after her.</p>
                     <p>Morgan had not spoken to a soul, not even his brother Girard. They had
                        forbidden the utterance of their respective names! They had refused a last
                        kiss, when delay made it dangerous. Poor, simple lovers!</p>
                     <p>They believed they held their secret locked up, when it was already flying
                        about the country, whispering in this ear or that.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes they had seen skiffs pass them, and heard a laugh rise from its
                        propellers, but they had let the strangers past unchallenged, never
                        imagining that the laugh had followed some jest or fingering-pointing at
                        them.</p>
                     <p>It was one evening in the beginning of October that Morgan learnt at last
                        the fatal truth.</p>
                     <p>Heavy rains had swollen the water-courses. An inundation was greatly
                        feared!</p>
                     <p>Morgan had gone to Charleston to see about some money owing his father. He
                        wanted to be back before dark, but several things delayed him. He met a
                        friend while he was waiting, and they went into Waxter's Washington House to
                        while away the time with a game at cards.</p>
                     <p>The room was but a small one, and the storm of the outer air had induced
                        many young men to assemble within, where they gave themselves up to bets on
                        quarter-races, dicing and drinking.</p>
                     <p>Morgan and his friend were in the middle of their play, when the former's
                        attention was diverted by several very loud bursts of laughter, heard from a
                        corner of the room.</p>
                     <p>From that moment, warned by the brutal merriment that some malevolent
                        intention was concealed beneath it, Morgan threw out his cards at random. So
                        plain was his careless play that his friend, surprised, remarked:</p>
                     <p>"What are you doing, Morgan? You're trumping your own card, playing twice
                        instead of taking up. Look out!"</p>
                     <p>"I beg your pardon."</p>
                     <p>The game had not gone on for more than a minute longer before Morgan turned
                        white as his shirt-ruffles, flung down his deck of cards, and rushed toward
                        the table in the corner. Half a dozen young men were playing dominoes with
                        bottles of French wine before them.</p>
                     <p>The eldest of them was a well-dressed man, but his dissipated and debased
                        visage was well known throughout town as that of Squire Notstanton, a
                        quarrelsome man, who had mortgaged his plantation more than once, but by
                        savage threats of what revenge he would take on any one who undertook to
                        claim his rights under the deed, had presented his tenancy being ended.</p>
                     <p>A second man was a Creole of about twenty-six, with scarred face and bright
                        eyes, who had a whip, and a dirk-knife stuck, sailor-fashion, in a
                        parti-colored scarf wound round his waist.</p>
                     <p>Morgan knew him as a New Orleans slavetrader, who had come to his father on
                        business. It was he whom he addressed.</p>
                     <p>"Do you dare to repeat what you just said?" thundered he.</p>
                     <p>"Dare's a fierce dog to be sent to kennel so easy! Who'll prevent me?" said
                        Jules Lazet, the Crescent Citizen, in the most unmoved of tones. "I said,
                        and I say it for the second time, that the rich girls on the plantations
                        like their fun no less than the girls of the town; and owning a dozen
                        niggers don't make any man's daughter fit to preach virtue."</p>
                     <p>"You uttered a name!"</p>
                     <p>Lazet rose from the table, as if aware that his answer was going to enrage
                        the young man, as, indeed, it was well calculated to do.</p>
                     <p>"Yes," said he, with his most modest smile, "I mentioned the name of the
                        prettiest <foreign xml:lang="FRA">petite fee</foreign> up Georgetown
                        way!"</p>
                     <p>All the drinkers who had been sitting down jumped up and crowded around. By
                        the provoking looks, the murmurs and the sayings that saluted Morgan, he
                        found that they were all enemies around about him.</p>
                     <p>There was, in fact, a kind of feud between the Charleston and Georgetown
                        people about the latter port lowering harbor fees to entice ships there to
                        load. Beside, old Haviland's taunts and sneers about Southern Yankees, who
                        made their greasy money by peddling pins for women and cahcoes for nigger
                        gals, had brought his family into bad repute.</p>
                     <p>But Morgan was not the man to draw back the breadth of a cane-leaf, if
                        there'd been a hundred or a thousand gathered round him, instead of the
                        dozen or twenty.</p>
                     <p>"It takes the meanest trash to make the coward," said he in a clear voice
                        like a trumpet in the almost solemn silence; "the coward of the blackest
                        brand that has the baseness to insult and slander a young lady whose
                        mother's a widow, and who has no father or brother to stand up for her!"</p>
                     <p>"Ay, ay! that's talk!"</p>
                     <p>"She mayn't have brother or old folks," sneered Jules, "but she has lovers,
                        and they'd better take it up!!'</p>
                     <p>The word "lovers" heaved Morgan's fury up to the highest point, and he
                        struck Jules across the face. Jules, hit back and grabbed at his waist, but
                        Morgan had been too quick for him, and he only seized his whip, for the
                        other had the knife in his grasp.</p>
                     <p>All shouted, some falling back, some crowding on.</p>
                     <p>There was a scuffle, and Jules and Squire Notstanton rolled under the
                        table.</p>
                     <p>Lazet leaped up and jumped over the table, with blood streaking his breast.
                        He caught Morgan round the waist with a wild shriek in Louisianian French,
                           "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Lengpour seng!</foreign> Blood for blood!"</p>
                     <p>Equally youthful, skillful and vigorous, it was a fair tussle between them
                        for a moment.</p>
                     <p>Morgan's friend tried to interfere, but the crowd overpowered him and broke
                        his head with a leg of the shattered table.</p>
                     <p>Five or six then turned upon Morgan, in good time to save Jules, for the
                        planter's son had squeezed him so tightly, that the ribs had bent in around
                        the first stab and made the blood spout out in a long hot stream. The
                        slavetrader dropped into his friends' arms without a movement.</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile, without respite given him, Morgan found himself fettered in arms
                        and legs by the men trying to secure him. He fought with the energy of
                        desperation, finding a power within him which had never before been
                        awakened. While defending himself, he foamed at the mouth with taunts upon
                        them, calling them cowards to go at a man ten at once, and even then, not
                           <emph>best</emph> him!</p>
                     <p>He got his rightarm free when the whole party of them fell over a table.
                        Then he stabbed twice, down, down, like Sergeant Jasper planting the
                        flagstaff between the two logs of the breastwork coping.</p>
                     <p>Suddenly a shout arose: "He's dead!"</p>
                     <p>One of the two, Lazet or Notstanton had been picked up lifeless.</p>
                     <p>There was a moment of stupefaction. Four or five of his assaillants shrank
                        back from Morgan. Waxter ran out into the street, crying "Police!" His wife
                        screamed behind the counter.</p>
                     <p>Still, Morgan was encumbered by a half dozen, and, other knives coming in
                        play, he felt something more painful than bruises on his body. He felt that
                        he would be lost if he did not break away by a tremendous effort. The
                        struggling group of the planters, dragging the men clinging to him around
                        the room, came near the window, into which the inland breeze, rushed through
                        a broken pane with scents of the Georgetown woods.</p>
                     <p>It inspired him like a word from hisfather, or, his beloved.</p>
                     <p>He stabbed right and left, cut himself clear and sprang upon the counter.
                        Running along it, he rushed to the window, covering his face with one arm,
                        and sprang forward out into the street, carrying sash and broken
                        glass—all—with him. Cut in fifty places, with the smart of the glass atoms
                        and wood slivers in the wounds, he picked himself up.</p>
                     <p>Though in the street, he was not saved.</p>
                     <p>Up it were coming a number of people collected by Waxter's outcries.</p>
                     <p>Surprised at first, and almost spell-bound by such boldness, his
                        adversaries, soon throwing aside their stupefaction, had rushed out of the
                        doorway.</p>
                     <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC8328-00000027"/>
                     <p>It was cloudy, rain was impending, but, as often happens, the light hung
                        about the level ground.</p>
                     <p>He darted around the hotel, and climbing a slight slope of made ground, ran
                        away across upon some vacant lots at random.</p>
                     <p>While running off with the shouting pack at his heels, he reflected.</p>
                     <p>He made up his mind to reach the river, find something floatable along the
                        bank, and plunge in with it, if no boat presented itself.</p>
                     <p>He gave over any attempt at doubling, and went straight ahead, taking stone
                        and weedpatches just as they lay in the line.</p>
                     <p>His followers lost, if anything. One of them had a pistol and another a gun,
                        which they discharged as they ran.</p>
                     <p>The flash warned the fugitive, and instinctively he leaped aside.</p>
                     <p>At the same moment, just before the double report rang out, he felt a
                        dreadful pain, as if something was tearing the flesh off his left hip. He
                        clapped his hand to the spot, and stumbled. The blood gushed through his
                        finger.</p>
                     <p>Ere he could regain his footing, much less go more in advance, a man rushed
                        on to him, amid the loud cheer, and flung his arms around his neck behind
                        his back.</p>
                     <p>He had the knife still in his hand—the bloody, murderous blade—and by a
                        backstroke he left it in the man's abdomen.</p>
                     <p>With a howl, the latter fell from him, and he could run on once more.</p>
                     <p>Two of the pursuers stooped over the man rolling in agony, while five
                        continued the chase. But Morgan was active, and the horror of his situation
                        tripled his powers. Heated by the fight and the bloodshed, he felt none of
                        his wounds, not even the last and most serious one, but strode on, his
                        elbows to his side, his hands on his breast, as if in a pedestrian
                        match.</p>
                     <p>Soon he could not catch the sound of his pursuers' breathing; then their
                        footsteps were less audible, and soon after he heard nothing of them
                        whatever.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding this, the young man floundered on over the wet wildland,
                        clearing the fences and running up and down out of the wide draining
                        ditches.</p>
                     <p>When convinced that he must have distanced his foes, he let himself fall at
                        the foot of an oak.</p>
                     <p>On his left hand lay the country, dark as a sheet or brown paper traced with
                        ink lines; the barking of dogs was all the token of life there: on his right
                        the river rushed noisily. Before him, for he faced the quarters whence he
                        had run, the dim lights of the town glimmered like faded stars. Beyond, a
                        sort of phantom wall, of a grayish-blue hue, was swiftly traversing the
                        harbor and spreading in a southerly direction. It was the low clouds running
                        before their weightier fellows which were laden with rain.</p>
                     <p>Binding up the shot-wound on his hip in a mechanical manner, he tried to
                        arrest the whirl of his brain.</p>
                     <p>The succession of terrible incidents had flown along with dizzy rapidity.
                        Between the moment when Morgan had entered the bar-room with his friend, and
                        the present, not forty minutes had sped by.</p>
                     <p>But how much life in that little while! That single evening was to weigh
                        down in his life-scale the first five-and-twenty of his existence.</p>
                     <p>Entering a house gaily, care-free, glad to be in spirits, sure of the
                        future, and yet driven from it a ruined man—for he had killed!</p>
                     <p>He had killed; and his hand was still daubed with the drippings of the tool
                        of murder.</p>
                     <p>He tried to understand the tragedy, as if it mattered to him who lay crushed
                        in the depths of a gulf, which was the stone which had given way under his
                        foot on the ragged edge of the bluff above!</p>
                     <p>If, besides, ruin had only befallen him! But not so. Allantina was also
                        destroyed. All was over with her reputation. And he, the man who had so
                        often chid her for weakness in self-command, he had torn to tatters that
                        good fame intrusted to him, more preciously guarded than his own.</p>
                     <p>But he could not there linger. No doubt a dog would be let loose on his
                        track—Heaven knew if the blood spilt would suffice to stop a hound! At all
                        events, they would go to his father's in the morning; and, as he must take
                        to flight, eh also must also see his father, and see the girl for the last
                        time.</p>
                     <p>He rose, but not without pain now, for the reaction had set in, and his
                        over-taxed sinews resisted the strain. The perspiration exuding during the
                        struggle and the flight made his wounds smart with its salts. He felt pain
                        in several places, the hip especially, and one shoulder, next to that. One
                        cut on his forehead had only stopped bleeding after having matted his brows
                        with the drops, and he could hardly keep his eyes open.</p>
                     <p>The dark hours of the night had flown and the storm had blown over, when
                        Morgan, after a dreadfully painful journey, reached his father's house.</p>

                     <p>On his hammering at the door, the oldest of the male house-servants came to
                        let him in. He receded terrified when the candlelight fell on him.</p>
                     <p>"Massa Mo'gan! What hab happen to yer?"</p>
                     <p>"Silence!" said the young man in that sharp voice given by the consciousness
                        of imminent peril. "Where's my father?"</p>
                     <p>"Up in his room, sah!"</p>
                     <p>Morgan crossed to the stairs, and getting a hard hold of the banister-rail,
                        rather dragged himself up than walked.</p>
                     <p>The old man followed him, muttering, as the blood spotted the steps, "Bress
                        us an' sabe us! Bress de Lord!"</p>
                     <p>Morgan opened a door, snatched the light from the negro and entered alone
                        his father's bedroom.</p>
                     <p>The planter started up.</p>
                     <p>The intruder's hands, face and clothes were soaked with blood.</p>
                     <p>"Father, I've come to see you for the last time, and to get some money. I
                        must get aboard of Capt. Gordon's Smokefly or the Swedish brig, and leave
                        for a foreign land."</p>
                     <p>"What?"</p>
                     <p>"Without delay. Perhaps I am being tracked now, and my pursuers may cross
                        the country to here at any moment. I have been in a fight, killed two men or
                        more——"</p>
                     <p>"Killed? Where? What?" exclaimed Haviland, springing out of bed and pulling
                        on his clothes. "The darkeys 'out' again——"</p>
                     <p>"No, no! In town, in a hotel, some time ago, at dusk, there were a dozen of
                        them and I next to alone, and I had to use a knife!"</p>
                     <p>"Townfolk? The counter-skipping, end of tape and bobbin-peddling scuff! Did
                        they insult you, my boy?"</p>
                     <p>"They insulted a lady in my hearing."</p>
                     <p>"And you knocked 'em down, the third-quality refuse-mixed! Served 'em right!
                        Who was the lady?"</p>
                     <p>"Miss Fretberry."</p>
                     <p>"Whew!" said Haviland, changing tone, "the daughter of that old Obey witch!
                        Soured sugar and sheet lightning! Devil mill the brood—she and hers are
                        regular bad luck to all of us!"</p>
                     <p>But however deeply he detested the widow, he respected what he thought his
                        son had acted upon.</p>
                     <p>"No matter, Morgan! her daughter's lady enough, I believe."</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile, the old servant had given the awakened household the full
                        particulars of his young master's ghastly appearance. Having excited them up
                        to true ghost-story pitch, he left them, and hastened to Haviland's chamber.
                        Presuming on his familiar footing, he ventured to open the door a little to
                        let in his gray-wool head, and calmly and most exquisitely innocently
                        asked:</p>
                     <p>"Did 'ee call me, sah?"</p>
                     <p>"No, you black rascal!" returned Mr. Haviland: "but, now you are here, bring
                        some cotton, dry and fine-picked—some of that out of Morgan's room."</p>
                     <p>In a moment the order was executed.</p>
                     <p>The young man had escaped better than he expected. The knife-gash in his
                        shoulder was ugly and gaped wide, obstinate against the diachylon, and the
                        edges of the shot-wounds in his hip had closed with an angry flush, so that
                        it seemed equally dangerous to probe for the leaden peliets or to run the
                        chance of their working out.</p>
                     <p>The rest were scratches.</p>
                     <p>After having washed himself and donned dry clothes, the young man felt a
                        world better.</p>
                     <p>The servants having been sent away, Mr. Haviland took some coin from an oak
                        chest-of-drawers and gave it to his son.</p>
                     <p>"So you think it best to go abroad?"</p>
                     <p>"Better than to go North. Oh! yes, sir. I may be taken there——they'll give
                        up white where they won't the black! If I am once in prison, it may be made
                        very black against me."</p>
                     <p>"It is the best way. What did you tell Sancho?"</p>
                     <p>"To get Bob to rouse up one of Fretberry's niggers—they'll do anything for
                        me—and they might stop one of ours to go down the river and tell Captain
                        Gordon that I am coming aboard. He's safe."</p>
                     <p>"The captain has all aboard to the last deck bundle of fishrods, but he'd
                        fire his ship to oblige me."</p>
                     <p>"I thought so, father."</p>
                     <p>Morgan paused.</p>
                     <p>"Father, before I go, I have a sacred duty to perform. I have kept back a
                        great deal from you. I am in love with the girl whom I defended, Miss
                        Fretberry."</p>
                     <p>"Ah!" ejaculated the planter, astounded.</p>
                     <p>"I entreat you, father, to induce the widow to give me her hand. I know that
                        Allantina will not hesitate to share my fate, even in a faroff land."</p>
                     <p>Morgan stopped, alarmed at the effect of his speech.</p>
                     <p>The old planter had turned as red as if going to fall in a fit of
                        apoplexy.</p>
                     <p>"This is monstrous! This is madness!" gasped he, all but choking.</p>
                     <p>"I love her, father; and I have sworn not to have any wife but her."</p>
                     <p>"Stay single, then!"</p>
                     <p>"I will marry her!" cried Morgan, losing his self-control. "I must wed her—I
                        have promised to, and both of us can only be happy at that price."</p>
                     <p>"You're crazy, I say!"</p>
                     <p>"I tell you Miss Fretberry shall be my wife, because it is too late for me
                        to take back my word, if even I would do that. She has—what those ruffians
                        in the barroom said—but too well proven that she loves me!"</p>
                     <p>Morgan had relied on the weight of this avowal. The old man laughed, as if
                        relieved, and a wicked sparkle twinkled in his eyes.</p>
                     <p>"Your mistress, eh? By George! what a judgment on the old hag, her
                        mother."</p>
                     <p>"Father, you have not understood me! I say I love her."</p>
                     <p>"Stuff, all that. Love her as much as you like, but wed her, not at all! Do
                        you know that, thanks to her mother, yours died!"</p>
                     <p>"What?"</p>
                     <p>"It was so long ago that you do not remember. That widow set her cap at me.
                        She knew her ailing husband would not last long, and she deliberately
                        courted me, while my good dear was here by my side. What stories she set
                        afloat, what means she took to poison your mother's mind against me, I
                        cannot say. Your mother was, in the end, induced to believe me as coldly
                        wishing her removed, as perhaps Mrs. Fretberry desired the squire. At all
                        events, while I suspected nothing, the evil was done. One day, your mother,
                        driven to desperation by some little attention which the squire's wife
                        manœuvred me into paying her, went to the medicine-chest and drank off the
                        contents of a phial. She died; and I am not even sure that she believed my
                        indignant denial of what had been so stealthily, so cunningly contrived.
                        Now, you can understand why I abominate that awful woman. She is, in my
                        eyes, as guilty of murdering your mother as tough she had given the poison
                        herself. And <emph>you</emph> want to marry <emph>her</emph> child! Be glad
                        that you have unawares taken good revenge!"</p>
                     <p>"I never knew this before, but still Allantina is not her mother. I mean to
                        make her my wife! That is a noble reprisal!"</p>
                     <p>"How dare you talk that way? Lecturing me! Now, you never shall marry the
                        thing! Never have my consent! I'd rather see you in the lock-up, aye, and
                        swinging in irons on the sand island where the pirates hang, than matched
                        with such a light o' love!"</p>
                     <p>The final word drove the hearer wild.</p>
                     <p>"Let it be so, then," said he; "I will stop where I am and, let them take me
                        and do their worst. It's little to me. I won't live hopeless."</p>
                     <p>A fearful outbreak would have arisen between the father and son, had not the
                        room door been suddenly dashed in.</p>
                     <p>Girard Haviland, booted, and with one spur on, the other being lost off, as
                        the torn leather on his boot-counter proved, by some accident, limped in,
                        coated with splashes of mire, and the seed of swamp-grass up to the
                        waist.</p>
                     <p>"The devil—you here yet!" he cried, seeing his brother. "There's fifty men
                        taken to horse to come here for you. You must go at once, for I had a fall
                        from my 'Nymede, who'll never carry boy's weight again. I've foundered my
                        horse, d'ye hear, and yet hav'nt much outstripped them!"</p>
                     <p>"Fifty!" shouted old Haviland, taking down a pair of pistols from over the
                        head of the bed. "Don't care if they're a hundred. Ring the big bell! We'll
                        muster our hands and send all the bonnet-string dealers back to their
                        shops!"</p>
                     <p>The negroes crowding the entry uttered a shout by way of cheer.</p>
                     <p>"Sen' dem Charl'ston fellers back wid a tick in de ear; oh, yes, massa!"</p>
                     <p>Luckily, while all the rest were too much excited, Girard had his wits about
                        him.</p>
                     <p>"To resist would be madness," said he. "If we drove them off to-night,
                        they'd have the sheriff down on us to-morrow."</p>
                     <p>"True," groaned the planter; "the boy's right. There was a time when no
                        sheriff durst cross a man's plantation."</p>
                     <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC8328-00000028"/>
                     <p>"Hark!"</p>
                     <p>A furious barking of dogs was heard, as the hounds, let loose, dashed toward
                        the gates of the garden entrance.</p>
                     <p>"Morgan must go out by the river!"</p>
                     <p>"De boat's gone wid Bob, sah! He's gwine to len' him to Fretberry's nigger,
                        sah!" explained a servant.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, yes! Pshaw!" cried Morgan. "I'll go through the 'low dip' and up into
                        Fretberry's woods. Thence I can work round to the creek, where the scows are
                        tied up."</p>
                     <p>Armed, the planter and his sons went down and out upon the portico.</p>
                     <p>The dogs were to be seen jumping up, attempting to get through the bars of
                        the large, strong gate. Shouts and calls, as of persons who were collecting
                        a party scattered by some of them having distanced the others, were faintly
                        audible on the road outside the barrier.</p>
                     <p>The slave-driving friends of Jules Lazet had eagerly joined their forces to
                        Squire Notstanton's avengers, and, with all the rare delight of a prospect
                        of a fight, with the law on their side, they had waited only for a constable
                        to mount and cross country to the Haviland plantation. Girard, who was in
                        town carousing, heard of the affray, and had, perhaps, not disinterestedly
                        as some may think, hastened to warn his brother.</p>
                     <p>"I'll fix 'em!" said old Haviland, pacing up and down the platform. "We
                        mayn't be the strongest, but we'll play them the cutest trick. Hark ye, all!
                        Girard, my lad, get you to the stables with one of the boys. Here's a coat
                        from Morgan's room for one of the boys! Pick out two nags—La Verdure and
                        Thunderspike'll do! Ride to the main gate. Girard—the boy on the wagon-track
                        to the back road. When I set the fire-bell ringing open all the gates, my
                        men, to let out the riders. Dash smack through them, Girard—and is it you,
                        'Toine, that's going!"</p>
                     <p>"Me! me! me! sah! to save Massa Mo'gan!"</p>
                     <p>"Toine will do!"</p>
                     <p>"I'll make 'em follow me," said Girard.</p>
                     <p>"And for Heaven's sake, tie up the dogs, you lazy rascals! They'll only get
                        killed!"</p>
                     <p>Girard and Antoine ran off to the stables.</p>
                     <p>Haviland squeezed his elder son's hand and said in a voice which all his
                        efforts could not steady. "Get clear, my dear boy! and we'll see about how
                        much I love you! Away you go!"</p>
                     <p>Morgan stuck a pair of pistols, which a negro had loaded, in his bosom, and
                        went off at a gradually quickening pace through the irregular line of the
                        cabins, at whose doors the slave-women, many with big-eyed, fat-legged
                        picca-ninnies clinging to their gowns, had assembled to wish the young man
                        farewell.</p>
                     <p>The dogs had been dragged away from the gate howling savagely, and now a
                        dozen forerunners appeared at the bar.</p>
                     <p>"He's a boy to be proud on!" muttered the planter, as Morgan disappeared in
                        the hollow between the cabins and the neighbor's forest. "Twenty foot in the
                        clear, 'thout wind-shake or 'pecker hole! He won't be dragged back to no
                        Charleston alive!"</p>
                     <p>Then lifting his hand to the pair of sturdy negroes grasping the long rope
                        which snaked down from the bell-house on top of a high pole, he cried;</p>
                     <p>"Pull away, Sam!"</p>
                     <p>The large bell was set a-ringing furiously.</p>
                     <p>Upon that signal, just as one of the horsemen had dismounted to try to
                        unfasten the large, high gate, it was most unexpectedly thrown open, and
                        Girard knocked the fellow down with the first stride of his horse. The next
                        second he had swerved from the road and dashed along the outside of the
                        fence, drawing away a dozen of the riders.</p>
                     <p>At the same instant a shout was heard in another direction, and another
                        division started off after Antoine, who raised the taunting cry especially
                        to tempt them.</p>
                     <p>Thus, Morgan would have been saved, but, by accident, Girard's horse missed
                        a quite low leap, and, going down on his knees, flung the backer off. The
                        party surrounded him, and instantly one or two of them recognized the
                        younger son, but too well known by townsfolk.</p>
                     <p>"This is Girard! Girard! the other brother! Let's turn back quick."</p>
                     <p>They were about to rush off in the direction which their friends had taken
                        on the tracks of Antoine, when they saw one of their number turn bridle and
                        come at full speed toward them.</p>
                     <p>"Bit!" shouted he, as he neared them, "it's one of Haviland's niggers! we
                        saw his black face and paws!"</p>
                     <p>Massing together, they galloped through the gate, left open, and scattered
                        over the grounds in every direction.</p>
                     <p>One of them, as much by chance as anything else, took the proper course,
                        for, to his own surprise, he espied a figure swiftly traversing the
                        lowlands, and about to rush up the rise. Giving a halloo, which he knew
                        would be followed, he spurred forward, dodged the shower of stones and
                        sticks flung at him and his horse as he flew past the slave-huts, and
                        rattled through the shelly bottom of the dip-land.</p>
                     <p>Over twenty of his companions were at his heels.</p>
                     <p>On rough or in wooded ground, it is easy for an active footman, if he keeps
                        cool, to escape any number of horsemen.</p>
                     <p>Once up the farther slope, the woods were at hand.</p>
                     <p>But Morgan did not make straight for their shelter. Risking the shots that
                        might be fired at him, he skirted the line of trees and led the pursuers
                        into a broad stretch of case-stubble.</p>
                     <p>The furrows between the rows, widened and deepened by the late rains, were
                        nearly a yard apart at the tops. The cane had been cut close to the ground
                        originally, but the earth washing away, the stubble stood up a foot or so
                        clear, hard and sharp as the vertical cut of the caneknite left each
                        rod-end.</p>
                     <p>The pursuers reined up, without attempting to ride across the field. But
                        four of the youngest men did hazard it. One of them lamed his horse at the
                        second stride, and the other three floundered but little further before they
                        gave it up.</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile, leaping over each center hill of three, went Morgan went across
                        the space.</p>
                     <p>The pursuit was therefore quite interesting from the hunted man having
                        chances for him. Hence the pursuers became impassioned, and, with an
                        increase of ardor, executed the circuit necessary to avoid the
                        cane-field.</p>
                     <p>Morgan knew the ground so intimately that he did not despair, especially
                        after the space he had gained. He beth ought him that after passing through
                        a grove of fruit saplings he would reach the cotton fields, and he
                        remembered that a very wide ditch separated the nursery from to them. He
                        imagined that by scrambling up and down across this drain-pit he would have
                        left another stoppage in the way of his hunters.</p>
                     <p>But he had not remembered about the rains, or that the dam between the drain
                        and the creek had been knocked down come two weeks before the usual time of
                        removal in winter.</p>
                     <p>On coming out of the grove, he saw that the cutting was full of water.
                        Discouraged but not disconcerted, he was about to take a running jump, when
                        on the other side he saw three riders of coming down to a position abreast
                        of him. They had pone clear around the nursery and headed the end of the
                        drain-pit.</p>
                     <p>On seeing them, Morgan stopped at once.</p>
                     <p>To deceive them in the twilight by a false leap was easy enough, but between
                        the two fires, his remaining in the water would have been of little
                        advantage to him</p>
                     <p>To turn back was to yield to the troop, crushing down the peach and
                        plum-trees in the rear.</p>
                     <p>On his left was the naked ground, where he would be overtaken in three
                        minutes.</p>
                     <p>To this right, as he faced the drain-cutting, was the river.</p>
                     <p>What could he do, as the ring contracted around him as its centre? Show
                        fight with his pistols? Perhaps better blow out his brains, for they might
                        spare him to capture him!</p>
                     <p>One loophole was open—a narrow, wretched chance—but still it was a
                        chance—the river running down to the bay.</p>
                     <p>He ran thitherward rapidly, with his cocked pistols in his hand, following
                        the drain and then the creek.</p>
                     <p>As its outlet, a point ran out with an old windblown tree jutting forth, its
                        dead twigs collecting a mass of cotton-waste, plantain leaves, reeds and
                        other drift.</p>
                     <p>Under the young mans weight the stump shook and cracked, and a hundred
                        patches of bark full of grubs peeled off and fell upon the water.</p>
                     <p>From this stand Morgan looked back on his pursuers. There were twelve or
                        fifteen of them, not to mention the three on the other side of the creek,
                        who were urging their horses to take the leap.</p>
                     <p>"Give up, Haviland!" shouted the foremost of the party.</p>
                     <p>Morgan was reflecting. Pain wrung his heart, for often had he moored the
                        boat in which he and his beloved rested to this last very refuge in his
                        direst peril.</p>
                     <p>"Once, twice! will you give up?" shouted the man again.</p>
                     <p>The rushing of the river deadened the call. Morgan Haviland stood on the
                        threshold of eternity, and his entire life was panoramaed before his closing
                        eyes. Shaping something like a prayer, he turned his eyes from the cold,
                        dark, indigo clouds to the steel-like water beneath him.</p>
                     <p>He flung down his pistols, tore off his coat, and, hands over his head,
                        dived into the river.</p>
                     <p>The beholders had dismounted.</p>
                     <p>The violence of the leap had snapped the weak tenures of the old tree, and
                        it toppled over with two stumps out held, like a maimed giant clumsily
                        attempting to save the man who had leaped.</p>
                     <p>An eddy, caused by Morgan's plunge, caught the tree, turned it around, and,
                        its outer end seized by the current, it was drawn out and then swept away at
                        all speed.</p>
                     <p>Pity and horror, rather than disappointment, had forced a groan from the
                        lookers-on.</p>
                     <p>"He's gone!" cried one of them, letting go his tired horse's reins, and
                        leaning out over the low bank. "Poor fellow, there's no swimming in that
                        creek. His body may escape sharks and come in with the next turn o'
                        tide."</p>
                     <p>But one or two of these determined pursuers were of the stamp of the
                        associates of Jules Lazet and Squire Notstanton, and they admired the young
                        man's courage and vigor, and his manly resignation; for he might have been
                        the death of one or more of them with the pistols which they now picked up,
                        loaded, under their feet.</p>
                     <p>True Americans for applauding genuine courage, which needs none of the
                        Gallie parade of a theatrical last speech or useless blood effect, there was
                        not one among them now who would not have aided Morgan to escape if he had
                        but risen to the surface.</p>
                     <p>"I don't know how it strikes the bulk o' you, my friends," said the leader,
                        rubbing his horse's legs down with a bunch of wet snake-grass, "but I'd
                        rather see a fire break out in my store than go out a-helter skeltering on
                        another such an expedition as this."</p>
                     <p>"No 'casion to sing a psalm," said a young man. "Haviland's a wise man, and
                        prefers to fatten turtle than the sea-gulls. He'd 'a' hung for this, you'd
                        see! Now he'll get decent burial, I hope! Come on! His poor old dad'll
                        suffer most, and I feel for the old fellow, rough as his talk is onto we,
                        city folks. It won't be pleasant to have to break it to him that Morgan's
                        drowned."</p>

                     <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                     <head type="sub">THE LOVE-WATCH—THE WAIF—A PARTING—THE DECREE OF DUTY.</head>
                     <p>It had been the silly, childish habit of the lovers, Allantina and Morgan,
                        when they had not been able to meet during the day, to show a light at their
                        windows in the evening. One or the other might be straying on the grounds in
                        one of the many spots whence that signal of thoughtfulness could be
                        seen.</p>
                     <p>Miss Fretberry knew that Morgan was compelled to go to Charleston that day,
                        and was likely to be too fatigued on return to roam over the plantations
                        afterward.</p>
                     <p>So, finding the rain blown over, when she awoke rest less (she knew not why)
                        at an early hour, she rose. It struck her as she looked out that there was
                        an unusual baying of dogs on Haviland's grounds. Somehow or other, the air
                        seemed pregnant with a warning, an alarm, to her.</p>
                     <p>Unable to subdue the sensation, she dressed herself and went out of
                        doors.</p>
                     <p>Day was dawning. It was chilly, but her agitation prevented her feeling the
                        early air. The house-dog, mounted on his box, was intently gazing down
                        scream toward the Haviland plantation.</p>
                     <p>Allantina unchained him and let him accompany her. She had nothing to fear
                        there, where a scream would have aroused some of the sleepers in the huts
                        and the dwelling, and yet she was easier to have the hound with her. In an
                        unwonted manner, sparing of gambols, the dog seemed to be wholly engrossed
                        in considering the strange noises floating on the wind.</p>
                     <p>The young girl approached the river. There was a very pretty walk in Spring
                        and summer, for the river rushed by without leaving any of the sediment so
                        poisonous under the Southern sun.</p>
                     <p>She could see, a water bend enabling her, that the. Haviland negro huts were
                        dotted with lights. She feared a fire, at first, recalling vaguely that she
                        had heard, or dreamed, of a bell ringing.</p>
                     <p>At that moment of indecision—for she was thinking of turning backhand
                        alarming the overseer—the dog uttered a long howl and jumped off the
                        bank.</p>
                     <p>She started. The dog was swimming toward a human figure which was being
                        borne toward her, and which, but for the animal, would have passed her,
                        spite of its weak struggles.</p>
                     <p>A man in the river!</p>
                     <p>A ghastly presentiment froze the blood in her veins, and she closed her
                        eyes.</p>
                     <p>More dead than alive, when she opened them again at the bidding of her
                        heart's imperative voice, she saw, assisted by the dog, which must have
                        recognized him, Morgan Haviland pain fully drawing himself up the bank.
                        Twice he nearly ascended; twice the weakness of his limbs made him fall. The
                        dog had fastened his<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC8328-00000029"/> teeth in his
                        waistcoat and shirt, and, though half choking him, tugged so sturdily as to
                        enable him to reach the top of the bank.</p>
                     <p>He was saved.</p>
                     <p>In their excitement neither the fugitive nor his pursuers had taken the
                        backwater along the shore-current into, account. And the fact of the old
                        tree shooting down the stream had forced the latter to believe it only
                        followed the man's involuntary example.</p>
                     <p>Instead of that, he was twenty yards up past the mouth of the creek when he
                        rose to take breath.</p>
                     <p>He congratulated himself on it, and instantly dived under, keeping on in the
                        same direction.</p>
                     <p>But rivers are bizarre in their flow. According to obstacles in their way or
                        beds, they describe curves and sudden turns to one side or another. Buffeted
                        about like a cork or a leaf, the young man, too suddenly chilled by the
                        immersion after his long, sharp run, was carried hither and thither until
                        the side-current finally swept him, for the third time, by where Miss
                        Fretberry stood.</p>
                     <p>Needless to say that she took him in her arms, and with that sublime
                        instinct for restoring life with which the gentler bosom is ever warm, she
                        drew him from his dull stupor.</p>
                     <p>"You here!" she cried in a voice revealing her passion, "Oh, how good Heaven
                        is, for I was so alarmed about you. Your father's house is not a fire?"</p>
                     <p>"No, no! But God has not been good to us, Allentina, our secret is no longer
                        a secret—the whole coast know that we love, and we are laughed at!"</p>
                     <p>She receded as if thunderstricken, vailing her face in her hands and
                        moaning.</p>
                     <p>"It would have come hereafter," said Morgan, sitting up, his back against a
                        tree. The bad blood between our families has done it all. Our noble love
                        would be pride to any but us, for we are reduced to hide it shamefully and
                        to our pain."</p>
                     <p>"All is known! Is all known—all?" faltered the girl.</p>
                     <p>In the thick of his contest with men and the elements Morgan had preserved
                        his coolness, but the accents of that dear voice lifted up his spirit to
                        very delirium.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, curse that is upon me!" he said, gnashing his teeth, "for I only
                        crushed two out of the gang that dared to cast a slur on you! Two
                           <emph>only</emph> killed!"</p>
                     <p>"Killed! You have killed some one, Morgan!"</p>
                     <p>Her great horror flung a ray of reason upon her beloved.</p>
                     <p>"Yes," said he, trying to master his satisfaction, "I struck two or three.
                        That's how I came here. They've hunted me out of house and home, and I took
                        to the river to escape them. I thought to be out to sea by this hour, but I
                        have been permitted to see you and say I must depart."</p>
                     <p>There must have been a spirit in the girl of uncommon temper for her to
                        support so stoutly such unexpected news.</p>
                     <p>"Where are you going?"</p>
                     <p>"How do I know? I cannot tell, nor what future awaits me. I must get away to
                        somewhere afar off; change my name, disguise myself. Mexico—the East—there
                        are some countries where murderers have shelter!"</p>
                     <p>Hoping, expecting a reply, he stopped; but, finding no remark was made, he
                        continued with extraordinary vehemence:</p>
                     <p>"If I am glad—and you know I am!—that I see you before I fly, it is because
                        when every man and woman falls way from me, I have relied on the hope that
                        you will but cling the closer to my side. A bond unites us, oh, my best
                        beloved! far more strong, far less to be broken than any earthly ties. I
                        love you! Under the stars you are mine—as I am yours—by life, in life, for
                        life! You won't leave me to fly alone, my girl? To the griefs of exile, to
                        the cutting regrets of my ruined life, you won't add the tortures of your
                        absence——"</p>
                     <p>"Morgan, don't——"</p>
                     <p>"I knew it!" he cried, mistaking the meaning of her tone; "I know that now I
                        am not to fly alone. Your heart bids you bear the half of my burden! This
                        moment sponges the past clean away—blood wrote: 'Despair!' but all is bright
                        again! Let us go! Having our happiness to protect, to increase, I can brave
                        anything, and overcome all things. Come, my darling, we will perish or be
                        saved together! This is the future we dreamed of—the future of love and
                        freedom!"</p>
                     <p>He was mad, and, seizing the girl by the waist, he tried to draw her
                        away.</p>
                     <p>As the planter's son raved, Allantina had been collecting her thoughts, and,
                        though gently, it was with unsuspected strength that she extricated herself
                        from his embrace.</p>
                     <p>"What you wish and hope cannot be," she said in a sad, but most firm
                        voice.</p>
                     <p>"Impossible!" said the man, supporting himself by the tree, upon this placid
                        resistance, unaccountable to him.</p>
                     <p>"You know enough of me," continued Allantina, "to be aware that to share
                        with you the worst of human destinies would be the hight of felicity. But
                        above your voice, I hear another which calls me away from you. Duty forbids
                        me to follow you!"</p>
                     <p>"Duty? what duty? Can you think of remaining here, after the fight I had,
                        after I tell you the scandal is on every one's lips."</p>
                     <p>"I am dishonored, you mean? Am I more or less to-day than I was
                        yesterday—than I was any time this past half year? Do you think that sneers
                        and slurs can hurt me more than my conscience can cure? I am my own judge,
                        Morgan; and though your presence, your voice, the thrill in the touch of
                        your hand and lips, make me forget all else, when I am alone and far from
                        you, I should, I shall remember and mourn."</p>
                     <p>It seemed to the listener that another creature stood in the place, spoke
                        with the lips, of her whom he loved. He had never fancied that her gentle
                        soul had depths in it from which such thoughts arose.</p>
                     <p>"My mother! that's why I must not go from home, Morgan!"</p>
                     <p>"Ha! your mother! your mother, who was the death of mine."</p>
                     <p>"Then, you know!"</p>
                     <p>She caught the young man's arm so tightly as to hurt him, and stared into
                        his eyes.</p>
                     <p>"I know? what?"</p>
                     <p>"Nothing. No matter! Ah! Morgan, my mother is alone, she has nobody by her
                        but me. You wouldn't have me leave her."</p>
                     <p>"But my enemies will try to be revenged on me through you. They will let her
                        know all."</p>
                     <p>"Then she may be harsh and stern and pitiless to me! But will I not have
                        deserved as much? Oh, my dear Morgan! we have been seeing one another in a
                        dream which was, like all last Summer, too fine to last long or come again.
                        I expected an awakening, though not one like this! Wretched fools! poor,
                        imprudent fools that we have been! to believe lasting happiness could be
                        found outside of duty, Sooner or later, stolen fruit must be paid for. Let
                        us bow our heads and weep."</p>
                     <p>"Don't speak so!" said Morgan, too much of a man to understand or, at least,
                        rate such reasoning at its value. "Don't you know that to think of you
                        weeping breaks my heart?"</p>
                     <p>"Alas I may expect more than that——"</p>
                     <p>"You! What do you mean"——</p>
                     <p>"Know, Morgan, that since some time——"</p>
                     <p>Her lips were at his ear.</p>
                     <p>"Since some time, well?"</p>
                     <p>"Since some time past, I——No, no! I must be frightening myself. Look, the
                        sky is brightening! You must not linger here."</p>
                     <p>If he had been less engrossed about himself, the young man would have
                        guessed that still another woe was masked under his companion's
                        reticence.</p>
                     <p>"All hope's not lost," said he, pursuing his own thought. "My love and deep
                        veneration touched my father, I believe. Perhaps my letters, when I am out
                        of danger, or my brother Girard's entreaties, may induce him to ask your
                        hand for me——"</p>
                     <p>This hope seemed to terrify the girl.</p>
                     <p>"Heaven forbid that my mother should ever be asked that. I must tell you
                        that my mother has said that I must marry a rich man, and your father, with
                        two grown up sons to provide for, its not rich."</p>
                     <p>"What? For such a mother do you sacrifice me?" cried Morgan.</p>
                     <p>"She is my mother, and I know why I must forgive her everything! My duty is
                        to remain here, and here I stay!"</p>
                     <p>Morgan well understood that all his prayers would be shattered against such
                        a rock.</p>
                     <p>"Ah, you never loved me!" groaned he, wringing his hands.</p>
                     <p>"You don't think what you say!"</p>
                     <p>"You don't love me," he repeated, "or you could not be hard-hearted at this
                        moment! I don't love you such a petty degree! Without the ground you tread
                        upon, what to me is the world entire? Farewell! I'll give the creek the life
                        it miraculously preserved."</p>
                     <p>Allantina grasped his arm again.</p>
                     <p>"What's the use of my living?" said he wrestling with her. "I have nothing
                        to look forward to!"</p>
                     <p>"God is ever on high, my dearest, and he has charge of our future."</p>
                     <p>The tiniest scrap of canvas fluttering on a floating spar, will make the
                        captain issue orders for a change of course its way, and so that one word
                        "our" prefixed to the "future," altered Morgan's design.</p>
                     <p>"You order me," he said, suddenly re-inspired, "and I obey. Enough of
                        weakness. I see! I must have money for your mother! Right. In three years I
                        will come back with a fortune or I'll come back no more!"</p>
                     <p>Allantina clasped her hands and thanked Heaven for this abrupt
                        determination, which she had not dared to hope. She burst into tears.</p>
                     <p>"Now," continued Morgan, "my last desire. Everybody believes me dead, and my
                        safety depends on that. But I must not leave my old father in sorrow. Go you
                        to him to-morrow, and tell him that I am safe."</p>
                     <p>"I will, Morgan."</p>
                     <p>"They are astir up at the house. The bell will ring soon. Good—good-by, and
                        God in Heaven ever bless my darling——"</p>
                     <p>They embraced, and it is a wonder that they found courage then to part.</p>
                     <p>The planter's son stole to the mooring-place of one or two flat-bottomed
                        boats, chose one, took a pole from the bank, and pushed down the stream. The
                        tide had turned and, save that the cold made him shiver in his soaked
                        clothes, he had no trouble in reaching the bay. He got on board of the ship,
                        and three days afterward was landed at St. Thomas, where Captain Gordon
                        completed lading for the homeward voyage.</p>

                        SOWN—"TWENTY YEARS AFTER"—FORTUNE, A PHENIX, RISES OUT OF ITS ASHES.</head>
                     <p>Girard Haviland was one of those men concentrated in self, whose cold and
                        careless exterior masks a fiery temperament, exorbitant passions and
                        insatiate greediness.</p>
                     <p>Long before misfortune had fallen on his father's house, all sorts of
                        extravagant thoughts and evil wishes fermented in his diseased brain.</p>
                     <p>While apparently occupied in futile pleasures, this precocious hypocrite was
                        sighing for a wider battle-ground for his passions, cursing the necessities
                        which chained him to that part of the State, and the house which was so
                           <emph>slow</emph> a home to him.</p>
                     <p>He was the victim of a disorder the very opposite to homesickness. The life
                        of such a town as Charleston was, then, seemed to him deadly monotonous. He
                        thirsted for independence, for excitement, for spending money, for revels
                        and all the bad acts he had never done.</p>
                     <p>He cared not the turn of the scales for his father, and hated his brother
                        Morgan.</p>
                     <p>He had betrayed this latter feeling in a hundred different ways, which the
                        servants about the house had noted.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, that night, when the fall of Girard's horse had enabled the enemies
                        to catch up with Morgan, the negroes refused to believe it an accident and
                        muttered among themselves:</p>
                     <p>"Bad debil Girar! He's de deff of his good brudder, de Lor' knows dat he
                        is!"</p>
                     <p>Antoine, a yellow man; whom Haviland had brought from New Orleans after one
                        journey of his, whom the house generally believed to be a son of the planter
                        by some amour of his early life, had a saucy way, for his position, of
                        speaking out his mind when in bad temper.</p>
                     <p>When he had found the game was up, he had pulled up his horse and returned
                        to the plantation. Surprised at seeing Girard at the gate, he had not
                        hesitated to say, on learning the cause:</p>
                     <p>"What a pity that so good a rider as you, sah, let Thunderspike fall just
                        the moment that your brother's safety hung on your riding! I had the
                        roughest road, and La Verdure is not half Thunder for sure footing!"</p>
                     <p>The allusion hit so hard that Girard turned pale and was half afraid to look
                        up. When he did so, the Creole was giving him so significant a glance, that
                        he rushed at him, whip in hand, and would have lashed him, if the shouts of
                        the slaves, on seeing the horsemen take up the pursuit of Morgan, had not
                        stopped him. In time these men straggled back, wet, tired and disgusted, and
                        then came the last of them, depressed by the sight they had seen—Morgan
                        Haviland leaping into the creek, which had closed forever over his young
                        head!</p>
                     <p>The slaves surrounded them, and one word would have set them to tearing the
                        Charlestoners to pieces, man and horse. But Girard was quiet, not a muscle
                        of his face moving. The light of triumph shone in his eyes as an inner voice
                        whispered: "Now, you'll have all the old man's property."</p>
                     <p>The constable said:</p>
                     <p>"No, sir-ee! A pistol to my ear couldn't make me go tell Mr. Haviland what's
                        happened."</p>
                     <p>Girard had no such scruples. He went up to the house, up stairs, and into
                        his father's room, where the old man was—who knows?—perhaps trying to
                        pray.</p>
                     <p>In a firm voice, which he accented to <emph>tell,</emph> the young man
                        said:</p>
                     <p>"Father, between life and honor brother Morgan has not hesitated. He
                           is—<emph>dead!</emph>"</p>
                     <p>The planter, like a stricken oak, shuddered<pb n="58-59"
                           xml:id="VAC8328-00000030"/> from head to foot, clutched at a chair with
                        one hand, while his other tore at his throat, and fell to the floor. The
                        veins on his forehead were black with blood. Girard knew, from his extensive
                        experience with drinking men, that one prick of the knife he had in his
                        bosom would have saved the sufferer. But he walked to the head of the
                        stairs, and sent a servant on horse to the doctor, two miles away. Needless
                        to say, before he could arrive, Girard was the master of the Haviland
                        plantation.</p>
                     <p>Thus was he relatively rich. He who had never had fifty dollars to spend
                        without regret, found fifty thousand at his call.</p>
                     <p>While the earth upon his father's coffin in Georgetown churchyard had not
                        settled down, Girard was selling everything off the estate. Old slaves who
                        had thought that at last they had found one refuge from which their bones
                        would not again be removed, were disposed of to distant planters. Girard
                        would not hearken to the very man who had taught him to ride and to
                        shoot.</p>
                     <p>He was all calculation. He mortgaged the lands to his father's usual lawyer,
                        and received an advance of thirty thousand dollars of the sum agreed upon.
                        At the end of the week, having given out that the verdict as to the death of
                        Jules Lazet and Squire Notstanton of willful murder against Morgan Haviland
                        made it impossible to live there longer, he left, as if the ground was red
                        hot underfoot.</p>
                     <p>To cap the climax, he had avoided all his boon companions, the fellows who
                        had, expected to see him stand treat for a year on his windfall.</p>
                     <p>At Baltimore he made his first stop on his road to ruin. Almost his first
                        acquaintance was a woman who had a schooling to which what he called his
                        lessons of life were mere A B C. He had thirty thousand dollars to get rid
                        of, and ten times as much on demand, and had thought his pocket-book had no
                        bottom.</p>
                     <p>This woman bled him like a leech, and only left him when the gambling-cloth
                        was a more attractive field for him. He oscillated between Baltimore and the
                        capital, losing money as quickly in one as the other. At the end of twenty
                        months he was borrowing; in two more, he was selling his jewelry and fine
                        clothes.</p>
                     <p>Fortunately, the Mexican war broke out. One of his Congressional friends,
                        weary of his duning on the strength of fellowship in scrapes over cards and
                        glasses, shoved a commission into his hands, induced a company of Columbian
                        riflemen to let him fill up the blanks in it, with G. H. for quartermaster,
                        and was well pleased to have him off his hands. He rose to the rank of
                        colonel, but, on his return the temptations of New Orleans, then crowded
                        with military and the girls who had flocked there from up the river, cleaned
                        him out of a neat sam which he had not honestly acquired while serving Uncle
                        Sam, and compelled him to sell to an army broker his power of attorney to
                        receive his pay and pension. As for the Western land bounty, he lost it or
                        gave it away as soon as received.</p>
                     <p>To tell the truth, he was pretty near "letter perfect" in cards, but he
                        traveled the Father of Waters for some months, up and down, swindling,
                        gambling, and working mischief among farmers' daughters by his military
                        carriage. At Coventry, he had seduced a good girl, and he had corrupted her
                        with fiendish malevolence. Drunk every night, it was town talk that the poor
                        creature lent herself to all the deviltries which he could imagine, for the
                        delectation of his compeers. Upon this, her suiter, who was as honest as she
                        had been, bought a pistol, and penetrating the gambling saloon one night,
                        where he knew Jane and Colonel Haviland to be, aimed at the latter, but,
                        unaccustomed to firearms, it missed, and he had the cowardice to stab her
                        with a knife.</p>
                     <p>The affair was a cause of great excitement. Girard fled. His associates were
                        flogged by a vigilance committee's black men, and the poor girl was restored
                        to her home. But Girard had fascinated her somehow, and, though her folks
                        were truly kind to her, she left, and, by a miracle, penniless as she was,
                        begged her way to Pennsylvania. A gambler had told her that the colonel had
                        gone to the Quaker City, but the intelligence was blackly false. There she
                        suffered dreadfully, and terminated her life by dying in prison not long
                        after giving birth to a female child. This child was "Gipsy," the inmate of
                        the house in Rochambeau place, and mistress of Prosper Roadside.</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile, Girard, perfectly reckless about all this, if it ever came to his
                        ears went on in his evil ways. In time he came to New York.</p>
                     <p>At first he did well. His most intimate familiarity with cards during his
                        Southern sojourn ("and our army played terribly in Texas!"), his subtly
                        engaging manners, the skill he displayed in conversation—thanks to the
                        variety of men he had met in his life—and a marked hold that he seemed to
                        have the gift of obtaining over women, made him quite a valuable partner to
                        all the "foul" players.</p>
                     <p>But he had taken to drinking. A stroke of paralysis down his right side laid
                        him up, took the lightness and delicacy of touch out of his hand, and forced
                        him, on coming out into the street again to be only able in the roping-in
                        line.</p>
                     <p>Unfortunately again (remember this is this side of 1860 now), a new
                        generation had arisen. The old style gentleman was no use—there were none of
                        his class to respond to kindred tastes, and the greenies who came to Gotham
                        were only to be taken in by the curly-headed, spring-gaitered,
                        thin-cigar-smoking "fancy (succeeding "gallus" of ten years before,) boys"
                        who took their tows—<emph>not</emph> to anchor in Greenwood, to dine on
                        Brown's beef, cut with <emph>that</emph> yard-long knife under your amazed
                        eyes, to museums and theaters where a t-r-a-g-e-d-y (!) was dolefully
                        prolonged till bedtime in a sleepy hotel "on the 1776 plan"—no! but to see
                        Merritt watch the cut for deal, to sit behind a fast horse on a "skeleton,"
                        and drive in the Summer eve through the Central just before putting up the
                        animile.</p>
                     <p>Othello's (asking pardon of the colored general for the comparison,)
                        occupation was gone.</p>
                     <p>Girard could be supple, but not to the degree of altering the whole "style"
                        in which he had built up himself. He sunk lower and lower till he wallowed
                        in the dingiest, most squalid of dens.</p>
                     <p>All at once he remembered—if his brain, trained to run only in certain
                        grooves tending toward cheating, could remember—that he had not disposed of
                           <emph>all</emph> his old property. The mortgage had been foreclosed, he
                        knew, but he vaguely recalled some little reservation of something which he
                        had in the lull between two orgies, dreamily prudently made.</p>
                     <p>He startled the successor to his father's lawyer by a letter, and was
                        startled in return by receiving an answer to this effect:</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>DEAR SIR: You are laboring under an error. It is true that you reserved
                           from the sale ten years ago, the house and the garden at the rear of it.
                           The plantation has been cut up by two roads, but a rope factory
                           established on what is known as the North, or Fretbury estate drew away
                           traffic in another direction, and the communication only enhanced the
                           value of your property to let it fall even lower. The house is in had
                           repair, and the tenant pays but fifteen dollars a year. He is one
                           Antoine, a slave who bought his free papers in Florida after an accident
                           to him, and took the house three years ago. Absurd stories about ghosts
                           had hitherto prevented our letting of it.</p>
                        <p>We beg to enclose two New York tens, but having no Northern bills, will
                           retain the balance of said rent until your next advice.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Girard used the money to transport him home and there recruit, if not
                        repent?</p>
                     <p>No! He wrote for the balance, and received fifty dollars (for Antonie had
                        paid a few montns in advance to, perhaps, assist his illegitimate brother—as
                        so many supposed—the lawyers acquainting him with Girard's note).</p>
                     <p>The colonel made no reply to this generosity, greater under the
                        circumstances than he could appreciate.</p>
                     <p>He had combined and perfected many plans while he had been idle under
                        misery's ban. They answered his purpose. He actually shed his shabbiness and
                        walked forth among his fellow-knaves. But he had learnt wisdom. He no longer
                        attempted to keep pace with the knowing sports who were too fast for him,
                        but turned up on the Lexington and Madison avenues, on whom he spunged,
                        borrowing dollars and ten dollars, and even articles that could be realized
                        upon. He laid bets at the Union and Centreville and showed Young America a
                        definition, full-blown of the English "Welsher" (<foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                           >vide</foreign> "Taffy was a Welsher, and—consequently—Taffy was a thief,
                        for a gloss") He studied the hotel arrivals so industriously that the clerks
                        grew familiar with his face, till they would as soon have asked the pen what
                        it was at in the inkstand as challenge him as to his business with the book.
                        He dead-headed the to eaters with a friend on each arm. He, amiable shark,
                        turned himself into the pilot-fish, and made capital of the experience which
                        had cost him thousands, many years of his life, all his present peace, and,
                        not to be presumptive, perhaps the loss of his soul: half pander, half
                        swindler.</p>
                     <p>He was not snubbed, but he was made cruelly to expiate this favor of still
                        being, borne with. To his very face his conduct was discussed.</p>
                     <p>Hence, when alone in his den, he gave himself over to fits of rage.
                        Covetousness flourished rankly within him, and, choking the pallid growth of
                        better resolutions, caused him to feel that for a few years' opulence, there
                        was nothing which could stay his hand.</p>
                     <p>Again ensnared in a shameful case of an "unfortunate" black-mailing a
                        leading merchant, he was led to think of his birthplace.</p>
                     <p>He "beat" a dozen acquaintances out of as much cash as they could surrender,
                        and one day landed from the Star of the South in Charleston harbor.</p>
                     <p>Going to Georgetown, his first glance perceived how every thing had changed.
                        Houses covered vacant lots, it was low ground where a hill had been, dry
                        land where boats had run up, large trees where grass had carpeted the
                        marshes.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheless, the impression was so strong upon that man, tanned by the
                        bloodiest, darkest adventures, that he was of a mind to turn round and
                        depart.</p>
                     <p>But a secret voice seemed to tell him, there lies hope in the far-off.</p>
                     <p>How many events had passed since the days when he had ridden through the
                        town on his little pony, with a friendly face at every door! Then life had
                        glided by like pages of a fairy tale. Now he came homeward, branded, used
                        up, disgusted, having drained the dregs of the cup of shame, ruined in honor
                        and money, expecting only because he had nothing to lose.</p>
                     <p>The few strangers whom he met turned to look with curious eyes at him.</p>
                     <p>Along the road to his father's, houses were standing.</p>
                     <p>He could hardly tell where to expect the olden house.</p>
                     <p>When he first espied it, from a new road passing close by it, he shrank
                        back.</p>
                     <p>Though the walls and roof remained about the same in appearance, it was the
                        vilest of wrecks. Through the broken windows it could be seen that the
                        ceilings were hanging in patches.</p>
                     <p>Panes were in the parlor windows only, but some were of parchment, not
                        glass, and between the two, a rude sign was nailed up:</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>ANTOINE,<lb/> Boots and shoes made and repaired.<lb/> N. B.—Particular
                           attention to fishing-boots.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>The prodigal son approached nearer, staggered, tried to be ashamed at what
                        he had brought that dwelling to—from the reception-house of the gayest
                        company on the coast to the abode of a humble workingman.</p>
                     <p>Antonie was a cripple, his legs being nearly useless to him from an accident
                        received while he tended a crushing-mill. Forced to adopt a sedentary craft,
                        he had not hesitated (spite of a certain pride which seemed to support his
                        claim to white blood) to become a cobbler.</p>
                     <p>Antonie had forgiven the colonel for all that he had any right to have been
                        angry at in the past. But Girard felt burning with shame to mark the
                        contrast between him and the slave whom he despised. He had not hesitated to
                        leave his father's home, dismantle it, stay away from it, while the mulatto
                        accepted his wretched lot in life, almost happy because it was to end in the
                        scene where he had been once happy.</p>
                     <p>The colonel could not rest in the house. He went to a friend's, for he found
                        he had friends. No echo of the storms of his life, no suspicion of his
                        infamy, seemed to have penetrated there. He was known as the soldier of the
                        Texan war, who had shown the steel heart of the Palmetto State on the bloody
                        road to the Halls of Montezuma.</p>
                     <p>He, the "doctorer" of the mess-books, the hero of gaming-houses, the low
                        woman's bully, the abject "pard" of tricksters, could show his poorly-clad
                        figure in the market-place and hotel-stoops, with all eyes that were bent on
                        him full of pride that the soldiers of the United States, unlike those of
                        foreign nations, came back to private life penniless, thinking themselves
                        well and fully repaid for youth and blood freely spent by the consciousness
                        of having done their duty.</p>
                     <p>Again, the elder men remembered Girard's father, just to his neighbors,
                        hospitable; and the Morgan tragedy, expiated at last, wore a less dark
                        aspect after so many years.</p>
                     <p>In a hundred different ways, favor was showered on Girard. Few men ever had
                        such a chance to settle down and manfully set at the giant task of wholly
                        wiping out such a stained career.</p>
                     <p>For a month he lived as in a dream. All doors were open to him; little
                        children were held up by mothers' arms for the Mexican volunteer to kiss; he
                        ate and drank, and had to pay for nothing.</p>
                     <p>All of a sudden, while asking about the people whom once he had known, he
                        thought of the Fretberrys. One thing led to another, and after patient
                        gleaning, and especially one windfall from a now ancient negress, who had
                        been servant to that family, he learnt a secret on which he determined
                        instantly to erect a new fortune.</p>
                     <p>His brother had jumped into the creek, but had not been drowned. Morgan was,
                        perhaps, alive!</p>
                     <p>With that taste for careful "figuring," which card-players need and Girard
                        was well endowed with, he constructed from scraps the following complete
                        story.</p>
                     <p>Soon after Morgan had left Allantina's side, the early risen field-hands
                        found their young mistress insensible on the bank.</p>
                     <p>Taken to her room, the doctor who had attended<pb n="60-61"
                           xml:id="VAC8328-00000031"/> tended to Mr. Haviland was called. He
                        discovered what the careless widow had never suspected. The young lady was
                        mother to Morgan's child. Mr. Fretberry was afflicted at intervals with
                        outbreaks of a mania which had tormented her from youth up. When her husband
                        was on his death-bed, he had told this family-secret to Allantina, and made
                        her faithfully promise to watch over her, and prevent her mother being taken
                        away to an asylum.</p>
                     <p>He was foolish to give her such a charge, but she was too young to decline
                        it. So, for years, that poor girl had spied over her mother, and, when the
                        periodical fits came round, she would lock her in her room, by help of a
                        negro servant (alone, besides the doctor, in the knowledge), and nurse her
                        until she was restored again. By the care of preventing disturbing causes
                        from reaching her, the widow had often been for eight or ten months without
                        need for this alternative.</p>
                     <p>But it was a mournful school for her daughter, and had filled her with that
                        cold resolution which had so amazed Morgan Haviland during their last
                        parting.</p>
                     <p>It was this wild folly, which threatened under excitement to rise into
                        madness, which had persecuted poor Mr. Haviland, and indirectly been the
                        cause of his wife's self-murder.</p>
                     <p>Judge, then, what a blow it was to her, when the doctor cautiously informed
                        her that her daughter, whom report gave for Morgan's darling, was so
                        undeniably compromised.</p>
                     <p>She swore to be revenged on her; she would tear her eyes out; she would
                        shoot the villain; she would kill the brat!</p>
                     <p>Dr. Rogers was the oracle of Georgetown—one of those men whose memory
                        lingers long after they are no more. Under different circumstances, he would
                        have inscribed his name high on the roll of the nation's most famous sons.
                        As it was, he was known but to his county. He had some enemies; but they
                        were only those small minds, which blamed him because he would not turn from
                        setting a slave's dislocated limb to seeing some lady who had eaten too much
                        iced fruit over night.</p>
                     <p>He promptly told Mrs. Fretberry, eyeing her sharply and "holding her with
                        his eye," as became a physician conversing with a lunatic only in her lucid
                        interval, that:</p>
                     <p>"Miss Allantina is weeping her eyes out, as it is. The 'villain' is a poor
                        young man, who is dead. The brat <emph>must</emph> live. And you must
                        forgive your daughter, or she will die. Too much violent emotion has shaken
                        her to the center, and she is in a fever which your pardon may quiet."</p>
                     <p>With the quick and cunning decision of a diseased brain, the widow yiedled.
                        She forced herself to smile, and uttered some affectionate words to the
                        suffering girl.</p>
                     <p>The doctor, before he departed, told the old woman:</p>
                     <p>"Mrs. Fretberry, you are a mother and a Christian, and know what is to be
                        done. My duty is to save your daughter and her child, and I will do that
                        duty of mine. I cannot prevent you leaving the homestead; but if in three
                        months I do not receive proof that the little one—healthily born, mark
                        you—is doing well, I will leave my patient, follow you and demand an account
                        of that soul before the public. You know I was your husband's friend; you do
                        not, happily, know how much. I have disobeyed wise laws to be your friend;
                        and so, no offense!"</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Fretberry felt that she was at his mercy.</p>
                     <p>You may ask, how could such a threat have weight over an unhinged brain?
                        Social laws have more weight over them than seems admitted, strange to say.
                        In this case, the widow's mania was an erotic one, going no farther when she
                        was calm, than an intense greed for admiration. This passionate vanity had
                        turned all her dreams into a thirst for luxuries; and as her plantation
                        revenue was but small, she had based her hopes upon the advantageous
                        marriage of her daughter. Allantina's beauty, her charms and her
                        accomplishments, which she seemed intuitively to grow perfect in, were so
                        much capital from which a fortune was to be derived.</p>
                     <p>And now! no more millionaire sons-in-law, no more wealth for her old age, no
                        carriages, no fine dresses, no diamonds, no Summers in the North!</p>
                     <p>She had no head to attend to the plantation; she knew the overseers
                        plundered her; and she would die poor and in want.</p>
                     <p>She felt a pardonless enmity against her daughter, who had dashed the
                        promised cup from her hand while she had been about to drink. She wished her
                        dead beside her lover. But the doctor's piercing look haunted her too
                        constantly for her to think of attempting anything.</p>
                     <p>Now, we know what secret Allantina had been afraid of imparting to her
                        lover, knowing that he would never have left her, after that was once
                        revealed.</p>
                     <p>The negroes who nursed her managed to find out that the 'Nymede had left
                        without any incident occurring. There was no reason to doubt that Morgan had
                        saved himself.</p>
                     <p>This belief did more to restore the girl than all the doctor's care. In two
                        months she was able to travel.</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile, the widow had prepared for her project. She had sold half the
                        estate to the purchaser who had taken that of Haviland's put in the market
                        by Girard.</p>
                     <p>She had told ad her acquaintances that a letter, really ilnsignificant,
                        which she had received, called her to the North to receive some property
                        left her by will.</p>
                     <p>Allantina, foiled of seeing Mr. Haviland by his death, and of seeing Girard
                        by his departure, was compelled to confide the secret of Morgan's escape to
                        her faithful servant, so that she could inform the colonel when he
                        returned.</p>
                     <p>In Pittsburg, Mrs. Fretberry found a woman who took the child off her hands;
                        and, being on the point of returning to her friends in Cornwall (by reason
                        of her husband having been killed by a roof-fall in a coal-mine), agreed to
                        carry it to England, and support it as long as the stipulated sum should be
                        at her order.</p>
                     <p>She had roughly told her daughter that the child was in safety, and would
                        need nothing.</p>
                     <p>"You must forget the past, like a dream. You know me. I am determined not to
                        tell you."</p>
                     <p>Weakened by this blow to maternal love, freshly springing up within her,
                        Allantina showed none of that power which had made her once her mother's
                        guardian, and she feared to resist.</p>
                     <p>If on one side the dangers of resignation appeared guilty, on the other she
                        felt crushed by the weight of her false step. She was silent, even when her
                        mother went farther, and, at the Springs, poured criminations on her for not
                        having helped her to have the funds to dress like the beiles.</p>
                     <p>"Your shame has ruined us!"</p>
                     <p>Sometimes, Allantina had not been able to repress her retort:</p>
                     <p>"Would you have overlooked it if it had made you rich?"</p>
                     <p>The memory of Morgan had become a suffering. Perhaps, discovering the
                        uselessness of her devotion to what she believed her duty, she repented
                        having acted upon it. What had become of him? How is it he could find out no
                        way of sending her a token? He might be dead. Could he have forgotten her?
                        And like women, more apt than men to worry themselves with dark
                        suppositions, when they should content themselves with what they had
                        learned, she believed the worst. He bad promised in three years' time to
                        make a fortune and return. Once rich, would he return?</p>
                     <p>Could he return? The verdict had been against him, and, the deception once
                        made clear that he had not been drowned, he would be liable to arrest and
                        punishment.</p>
                     <p>Not a beam of hope illumined the murky view. All the springs in Allantina's
                        mind were dried up, and at length there came to her such passive
                        resignation, such heedless abnegation as befals those who have made the one
                        great sacrifice of life.</p>
                     <p>Four years passed.</p>
                     <p>Living a life less led at that time than in our present year, but an
                        existence stereotyped abroad, Mrs. Fretberry became faultless in the art of
                        showing herself as what she wished to seem. She dexterously avoided inviting
                        anybody to her rooms or house, but she was out to parties nightly. She
                        bought the costliest silks, because, when become unfashionable, they could
                        be sold at a less loss than cheap stuffs must suffer. Her jewels were false,
                        but good imitations.</p>
                     <p>This season she pitched her tent for active campaigning at a new spring
                        vaunted in the papers, and quite in vogue. It was in Virginia.</p>
                     <p>The proprietors of the property, amazed at the flock of visitors who
                        scattered money so freely, thought of nothing but running up colossal
                        hotels, to which Cape May's alone could compare.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Fretberry forced her daughter into prominence. She "took well," as the
                        saying goes, her melancholy, chastened features being a great contrast to
                        those of the young ladies who came to sport away time in defiance of their
                        mothers' matrimonial intentions.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Andrew Van Kieft, who had overworked himself, came to this "Abode of the
                        Rejuvenating Essences of Health," and at sight of Allantina, perceived her
                        superiority to all those around.</p>
                     <p>He was young; but his standing was good.</p>
                     <p>"Banker" is a "hefty" word. It knocks over the pins which even "merchant"
                        would not have upset.</p>
                     <p>With Andrew, growing more and more in love with her, on one side, and her
                        mother, full of strange and subtle theories, on the other, time was when
                        Allantina became Van Kieft's wife.</p>
                     <p>She had not by her, poor girl! one of those benevolent advisers whom many of
                        us find in our life. Recollections of Morgan Haviland spoke aloud to her,
                        and dictated her conduct; but with her mother's perpetual croak: "We owe A.,
                        and we owe B.; you can save me from poverty by wedding this good, kind,
                           <emph>rich</emph> young man!" the better voice was like the far-off
                        beating of the surf on Georgetown Point.</p>
                     <p>In novels you will find heroines whose virtue is the only match for their
                        constancy, but real life rules out most of such miracles.</p>
                     <p>Long had the handsome, manly Southerner been a radiant vision m her dreams;
                        but time had sent up yearly mists, and the idol had ceased to display its
                        rays and had become but a relic.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps she found an excuse in the horror of her situation. Even an unhappy
                        marriage offered are uge from the perspective of a change. Her mother's
                        health was failing; sometimes the glass had fallen from her suddenly
                        unnerved hand at the fountain; she had not had an attack of her mania for
                        some time, but there was that wild glare in her eyes the while that made
                        Allantina carefully lock her bedroom door, and wake up, more than once, with
                        the flesh a-creeping at the fear that her mother, knife in hand, was bending
                        over her throat or heart. In her ignorance—for she could not learn from such
                        a mother what other daughters might have found—she thought that in time,
                        after intimacy, the horrible confession would come forth naturally, and that
                        Andrew would pardon her, and not even put her away, for she was aware that
                        he loved her.</p>
                     <p>He loved her, truly so. Not with Morgan's passion, with his transports, his
                        extremes, but calmly, more thoughtfully, perhaps, because he would have the
                        lawful ceremony to cement the union. In the village, in the large hotel's
                        best room, they were married. The hotel-keepers made a celebration of it,
                        and the proprietor of the Springs had a column of the <title>Shadyhill
                           Repeater</title> about his "unselfish patriotism and generosity when the
                        Springs were in question, for his liberal display of fireworks, and,
                        notably, the A and A intertwined of the happy couple," etc.</p>
                     <p>Happy, alas!</p>
                     <p>Allantina was whiter than her vail, and she shuddered as if the spotless
                        array was but a bitter mockery. She started when her mother placed the
                        orange blossoms on her head as if they burnt her. One of the ends of wire,
                        strengthening the wreath, sprang inward, and pricking her forehead, one drop
                        of blood sullied her bosom.</p>
                     <p>An omen! say you?</p>
                     <p>Nay, for a year afterward Allantina was—so everybody said—the happiest of
                        women.</p>
                     <p>Happy she would have been, if she could have forgotten. Andrew adored her.
                        Her gentleness, her dislike for showiness, and her fondness for home, were
                        so many gifts expressly made for a banker's wife. He succeeded in ad his
                        operations, not only for his own enjoyment, but to surround his wife with
                        luxury. Eighteen months afterward, Mrs. Van Kieft had a child, a son. Alas!
                        neither he nor a second, the year after, could make her forget the other,
                        her first-born, who had been taken away.</p>
                     <p>Her mother, whom an eminent physician had tried to cure, had died of cold
                        caught by going to an entertainment too soon after a delicate operation
                        performed on her head. She had been stern to the last! and gave her daughter
                        not the slightest consolation.</p>
                     <p>Hence, while Mrs. Van Kieft was rearing her children like little princes,
                        she would wonder to herself:</p>
                     <p>"Is that outcast gnawing his finger-ends for want of bread?" If she had
                        known where he, or where Morgan was!</p>
                     <p>"He is dead, or has forgotten me," was her constant reply, to quiet her own
                        fears.</p>

                        OF THE LASSO.</head>
                     <p>This Girard had ferreted out, after upward of twenty years, that Allantina
                        Fretberry had been married to Andrew Van Kieft.</p>
                     <p>The banker was the same to her as in the honeymoon; their boys, Lucas and
                        Abel, handsome as their mother, were worthy sons, and nothing seemed wanting
                        to Allantina's felicity.</p>
                     <p>For the hours of solitude, when the husband and the sons were away from
                        home, she had Miss Viandra Oestervelt, whom she treated like her own
                        daughter. She was a niece of the banker, who had lost her parents at an
                        early age, and Mrs. Van Kieft had wished to take care of her, perhaps in
                        memory of her first born.</p>
                     <p>By this good deed she might condone for her early error, and Viandra might
                        be as the guardian angel of the house.</p>
                     <p>On the day she came to the house, Mr. Van Kieft said she must have an
                        account in his bank, and he entered her for three thousand dollars. This sum
                        the rich banker amused him with. He, who never, in his own business, took up
                        anything that promised <emph>too</emph> much, found<pb n="62-63"

                        deposit, and, winning always, he increased it shortly to ten times the
                        original amount.</p>
                     <p>Thus were they right who envied the Van Kiefts.</p>
                     <p>At last Allantina's stinging remorse had found a balm. In that genial
                        atmosphere of unclouded light, she had almost found oblivion and repose of
                        conscience. She had so cruelly expiated her fault and had undergone so much
                        for deceiving her husband, that she believed her debt was paid.</p>
                     <p>She dared to look forward, and a dense vail rendered all her past less than
                        a dream.</p>
                     <p>One day in November, about twelve months before our story opened, a note
                        came up to her. A strange gentleman had leit it, who refused to give his

                                 <p>MADAM: Can I hope that your heart-memory will induce you to
                                    grant me an interview? To-morrow, between 2 and 3, I will have

                     <p>She swooned on the spot, but, fortunately, was alone.</p>
                     <p>When she came to herself she read the lines a dozen times, as if to make the
                        reality of the fright beyond doubt.</p>
                     <p>As many times, with growing alarm, she spelt that name, once so sweet to her
                        ears, and its eight letters flashed before her, wherever she turned her
                        eyes, like the spots after a glance at the sun.</p>
                     <p>Oh, folly, that hope of the fatal past, that he was dead or had forgotten!
                        Behold how the dry bones had started up and were clothed with life!</p>
                     <p>It was not until after a long time that she could stand erect under the
                        shock.</p>
                     <p>Then she began to wonder why she had been so uselessly alarmed. What reason
                        was there to tremble because Morgan Haviland had written her a letter?</p>
                     <p>That, returned to his native land, he should want to see her, was very
                        natural. She knew that such a man as his youth assured his manhood would be,
                        would not cause her fear. He would come, see her old and the mother of a
                        family, and after a—regret, perhaps, that would be all.</p>
                     <p>But then, frightful questions arose.</p>
                     <p>That son of his?</p>
                     <p>To confess his probable existence was to put at the mercy of a man—a noble,
                        faithful man, but a stranger—not her happiness alone, but that of her
                        husband and children.</p>
                     <p>To be silent was worse. After having debarred him from a mother's cares and
                        caresses, should she rob him of a father's helping hand?</p>
                     <p>She dared not face her own sons now, but gave out that she was unwell, and,
                        locked in her room, for the first time was glad that her husband was
                        absent.</p>
                     <p>She counted the hours from the next day's dawn, and, after noon, the
                        minutes.</p>
                     <p>At last, a few instants after two o'clock, Colonel Haviland was announced,
                        and there presented himself a man who, after a respectful bow, remained
                        standing before her, waiting.</p>
                     <p>He looked about forty-five, with gray hair and moustache, with a dark, stern
                        and sad countenance, soldierly, and in a plain black suit well becoming
                        him.</p>
                     <p>Swayed by inexpressible emotion, Mrs. Van Kieft shudderingly wrought on his
                        face the features of the man whom she had loved to the utmost degree, the
                        lover who had clasped her to his breast, the father or a boy of whom she was
                        the mother. And she was astonished to find that so little of the youth whose
                        image had haunted her life, had remained—no, next to nothing.</p>
                     <p>As he did not stir, her expiring voice uttered:</p>
                     <p>"Morgan!"</p>
                     <p>But the man, shaking his head in sorrow, answered:</p>
                     <p>"I am not Morgan Haviland, who died in the loneliness of exile! I am his
                        brother Girard."</p>
                     <p>Not Morgan! but that other brother in whom he had not ventured to confide,
                        and yet out of her own mouth had been uttered a word in a tone which made it
                        the most explicit of avowals!</p>
                     <p>A shiver of terror ran down her from head to foot, and her head swam as if
                        she was on a mountain cliff.</p>
                     <p>Yet she succeeded in overcoming her weakness so quickly that the colonel did
                        not remark all its extent. The frightful novelty and the imminence of her
                        peril endowed her with superior clearness of perception.</p>
                     <p>She motioned her visitor to take a chair, and in the calmest tones begged
                        him to explain why he came to her.</p>
                     <p>Without lifting his eyes from her, Girard pretended not to remark her sudden
                        change as he sat down, and drew his chair up near the lady, saying:</p>
                     <p>"Though we may be out of others' hearing, what I have to say concerns you
                        more than me, and I must be careful. I said my brother Morgan is dead. As
                        was proper, I closed his eyes after I had received his last breath. I need
                        not recall to you, madame, the fatal event which ruined my brother. However
                        happy you are in life, you cannot have forgotten the friend of your youth,
                        who, without stop or stay, lost his life out of defense of your fame."</p>
                     <p>Not a muscle of the lady's face moved, for she was vainly endeayoring to
                        understand what were the speaker's designs.</p>
                     <p>"You have forgotten!" exclaimed he, bitterly. "I see I must try to be
                        clearer. For a long time, then, you loved my poor brother——"</p>
                     <p>"Sir!"</p>
                     <p>"It is useless to deny it. Morgan told me all—all!"</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Van Kieft rose. Since Morgan had not known in what condition he left
                        her, this "all" ought not to alarm her.</p>
                     <p>"You forget, sir;" she said, with an assurance far from her heart melting
                        within her, "you forget that you are speaking to a lady, a wife and a
                        mother. It may be that your brother loved me; if so, that would be his
                        secret, not yours. If, young and inexperienced, I was careless, it is not
                        your place to lecture me. <emph>He</emph> would not have done so. And,
                        whatever the past events that you speak of, twenty years have blotted them
                        out of my mind."</p>
                     <p>"So you have forgotten them all—even your son, madam?"</p>
                     <p>This sentence, accompanied with a soul-searching glance, fell upon the
                        hearer like the blow of an ax. She sank back upon the seat she had quitted,
                        murmuring:</p>
                     <p>"Oh! he knows! How can he have learned that?"</p>
                     <p>If it had only been herself in question, she certainly would not have
                        struggled longer; but she had the happiness of others to shield, and she
                        found an energy in that duty which she believed out of her power.</p>
                     <p>"If I understand you, sir, you insult me."</p>
                     <p>Girard shook his head. She could tell by his manner that he knew as much,
                        and, perchance, more than she.</p>
                     <p>"Will you listen?" he said. "Well, two years ago, my brother, in his
                        wanderings, was led to London, England. He met a youth there of the name of
                        Burnett——"</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Van Kieft did not start in the least.</p>
                     <p>"His features, his manners, very uncommon among the class with which he
                        associated, forced him to inquire about him. By one of those providential
                        occurrences, rare but not impossible, Morgan had met his son. Yes, his
                        son—yours, madame! Your mother had taken minute precautions and many. But
                        the woman who had accepted the charge of the infant found it a source of
                        annoyance to her. When she went down to her village on the coast, her
                        neighbors would not receive the child as hers, and made her a
                        laughing-stock, in the brural manner that distinguishes the English clowns.
                        She went to London to live there on the money forwarded by your mother. In
                        time that payment not only did not increase in the proportion agreed upon,
                        but ceased altogether. Hence, when my brother came to her, her rage at
                        having been cheated induced her to enter into such particulars that Morgan
                        had no doubt whence arose the likeness of the youth to you. He was on board
                        the Sanspariel, wrecked on the Jersey coast, two weeks ago. He was coming to
                        make further inquiries, which his death prevented, but which I have
                        prosecuted to the end of having ample confirmation."</p>
                     <p>He waited for some reply, but she did not even lift her head.</p>
                     <p>Then he said:</p>
                     <p>"My brother's last words were: 'If I am forgotten, and if that woman, whom
                        you tell me is a rich man's wife, will do nothing for her son, you, Girard,
                        will act as you think best!" I will delay a few days, madame, for a reason,
                        and then you will hear from me."</p>
                     <p>She made no effort to detain him. When he had gone she gave full course to
                        her despair, only having strength enough left to gain her room unassisted.
                        Now, not the shadow of a doubt. What were her twenty years of happiness to
                        this hour of hopelessness! Oh, why had she listened to her mother? why had
                        she not killed herself?</p>
                     <p>Such courage as she had never thought to be lodged in her had been useless
                        against this Haviland. He had left her with a threat, and was to call on her
                        another day.</p>
                     <p>A little more, and she would have betrayed what she really was, when the
                        visitor had spoken of her boy.</p>
                     <p>That poor youth had been suffering for his mother's sin. He had been without
                        food while she was eating off gold and silver plates.</p>
                     <p>Prudence told her that she must not accept Girard Haviland's help. To trust
                        him was to place her and her's at his mercy, and he inspired terror in her
                        by the unfeeling way in which he had borne himself.</p>
                     <p>Was he even speaking the truth?</p>
                     <p>Why had not Morgan sent a letter to her, or a messenger, long before? She
                        had friends near Charleston, and they had never mentioned his return to
                        life. Why had he not sent the boy?</p>
                     <p>A thousand suspicions pestered her.</p>
                     <p>She was well aware that one false step would make her the colonel's
                        accomplice for ever, and yet she shrank from the other alternative of
                        throwing herself at her husband's feet and confessing all.</p>
                     <p>Unfortunately, she repulsed that saving thought.</p>
                     <p>Deceived so early, might not Andrew doubt that he had been since abused? She
                        knew that he would be silent and would spare nothing to hush up the affair,
                        but all would be over with household happiness. He would turn away, the sons
                        would likewise, and all the family ties would be broken.</p>
                     <p>She would have taken her own life; but would her death stop a man like
                        Girard? He would rather blast her memory, in very spite.</p>
                     <p>As we have stated, the banker was out of town, and Mrs. Van Kieft could keep
                        her room without any one noticing her distress. No one, except Viandra,
                        whose feminine keenness divined that something more than "headache" troubled
                        her aunt. But the latter repulsed her inquiries with a sharpness very
                        surprising in a woman who was usually gentleness itself.</p>
                     <p>What Girard had surmised came to pass.</p>
                     <p>On reflection, and seeing no issue from her deplorable strait, Mrs. Van
                        Kieft gradually made up her mind to submission. By consenting wholly, he had
                        a chance of saving all.</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile, her husband returned, and she apparently became as in general.
                        But she was no longer the happy wife and mother, so ensured in happiness and
                        so calm as to what might happen. At each of her heart-strings keen-toothed
                        inquietude gnawed.</p>
                     <p>Without news of the colonel, she expected him at every minute of the day,
                        starting at each ring of the bell, turning pale when doors opened, not
                        daring to go out for fear he would come, meanwhile. The wretch condemned to
                        death, who wakes each morning, fearing, "It will be this day," has no more
                        dreadful anguish.</p>
                     <p>Too cunning to give evidence against himself, a letter from a stranger came
                        to state that Haviland excused himself for not keeping his appointment, but
                        he begged her to come and see him at the Merchants' Hotel, Dey street, next
                        day.</p>
                     <p>This note was almost a relief to Mrs. Van Kieft, anything being preferable
                        to her anxiety. She had resolved to consent to everything. She burned the
                        letter, saying:</p>
                     <p>"I will go!"</p>

                     <p>But it was not Col. Haviland that Mrs. Van Kieft was to see at the appointed

                        could not see you to-day, and left me in his place."</p>
                     <p>His face wore a sadly compassionate expression, as if he shared all of the
                        lady's distress.</p>
                     <p>"The Colonel cannot understand what reasons made you repulse him," pursued
                        he; "blinded by unjust anger, he spoke of forcing from you what your heart
                        would not yield. But I hold here," said he, taking a bundle of legal-looking
                        documents off the mantelpiece, "I hold here all the proofs which he could
                        use as evidence of the birth and existence of Burnett, alias Morgan
                        Fretberry. Not without trouble did I take them from him, and he never would
                        have let me have them had he known that I mean to do <emph>this</emph> with
                        them!"</p>
                     <p>As he spoke he dropped the packet into the stove, and placing the cover on
                        over them, the draft could be heard whistling the flame through and carrying
                        the blaze up the pipe.</p>
                     <p>"All is destroyed," cried the young man, his eyes aglow with the loftiest
                        generosity. "Now, none can say a word against you—not even your son!"</p>
                     <p>At last Mrs. Van Kieft understood so singular an act. The stranger who
                        snatched her from Haviland's anger, and made her free by destroying the
                        proofs of her shame, was the abandoned child.</p>
                     <p>She forgot everything to hold out her arms to her son. The next moment he
                        was at her feet, and as her hands strayed over his soft, fine cheek, and his
                        forehead, clear as a maiden's, her tears flowed plentifully. His voice, his
                        manner, his looks, all, recalled the lover whom she had parted with so
                        cruelly years before, and with all a mother's pent-up affection enchained
                        too long, she gave him the first kiss.</p>
                     <p>She listened to his story in enchantment; how he had been brought up in low
                        life, until one day when a man had come and taken him away, saying he was
                        his father. After a happy life together, Morgan had at last said that he
                        could bear it no longer: he must see the woman of his heart, married and
                        rich though she was, before he died. But they had been wrecked on the
                        American coast, and he alone could see the woman about whom his father had
                        so often spoken.</p>
                     <p>Oh, Girard had baited his trap well.</p>
                     <p>From this moment the steps were regularly forward.</p>
                     <p>First, the Colonel was placed on the visiting list of the Van Kieft.</p>
                     <p>Then, a letter came one day, purporting to be from Miss Jane Clanmoran,
                        Charleston, who after reminding the Miss Fretberry of the days that she had
                        been her music-teacher, when neither was as well off as at present, begged
                        her to look after her brother, who, seeing her father's relation to the
                        Fretberrys, was very nearly a nephew of hers.</p>
                     <p>A week afterward, Burnett Clanmoran, as became one of the F. F. S. C.'s,
                        dined at the banker's, sitting between the lady of the house and Miss
                        Oestervelt.</p>
                     <p>With tact superior to his age, he so managed his good graces that he had
                        quite captivated Mr. Van Kieft, did very well with Abel and Lucas, and
                        absolutely fascinated Prosper Roadside, the cashier, then spending the
                        evenings at his employer's.</p>
                     <p>But not without a purpose. It was hard enough—though twenty years' arrears
                        of affection were due him—for him to take it out in money to that extent
                        that she whose diamonds were cited as a standard, knew the most poignant
                        misery, as a duke of Great Britain once said—"that of having to refuse a
                        favor." One One day she ventured to reprove him at table. That evening the
                           <title>Express</title> had a leaded article on Mr. B—— C——, the young
                        Southerner, who lost a $2,000 bet on Dexter's time at the Centreville.</p>
                     <p>"Pooh! it encourages trade in a very roundabout way," said Mr. Van Kieft,
                        kindly, and with the air of a man who had his pockets full. "Mamma Clanmoran
                        will pay for her son's study of fast life in the North. Mammas are invented
                        to keep boys afloat. And," added he, not remarking that his words had made
                        his wife turn pale as her collar, "don't you be uneasy, my boy. If
                        remittances should fall, mind you come to talk with me."</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Van Kieft had said Burnett's folks were very rich, as Girard had
                        suggested. She felt she was entrapped,but no lie could save her, so lave as
                        this.</p>
                     <p>The banker's words had not fallen into water. Toward the end of the week,
                        Mr. Van Kieft incidentally mentioned that, meeting young Clanmoran under
                        Anderson's Cavendish statue, he had asked him to come to see his bank, and,
                        while inspecting the sumptuousness of the offices, Burnett had haughtily
                        said he was "strapped," and the loan of a couple of thousand wouldn't hurt
                        him. On hearing this, Mrs. Van Kieft was driven into an awful state.</p>
                     <p>As Haviland had ceased to visit them lately, she wrote to him to come and
                        see her, hoping that he could check the young man's extravagance.</p>
                     <p>The Colonel brought Burnett with him one day, and there was a scene between
                        them in her presence. But she was distrustful, and fancied that, spite of
                        their quarreling, their eyes were laughing. She durst not say a word, but
                        the suspicion of being deceived sank into her soul like a drop of
                        poison.</p>
                     <p>Clanmoran departed, apparently in a fury at his own way being refused him;
                        and then only, after having complained more bitterly than ever of the young
                        man's wildness, and having shown the hollowness of the ground under Mrs. Van
                        Kieft's feet, did Col. Haviland lay bare his aim. It was that he should
                        marry Miss Oestervelt.</p>
                     <p>The banker's wife had long been yielding everything in which she herself was
                        concerned, but that had been done to preserve the happiness of others,
                        injured by her fault.</p>
                     <p>"Do you think, sir," she exclaimed, "that I will lend myself to such a
                        design?"</p>
                     <p>The Colonel nodded.</p>
                     <p>"For shame! I have been very guilty, but no penalty should out-do the
                        crime."</p>
                     <p>"Is it so great a misfortune for the young lady to be my wife?"</p>
                     <p>"My niece has set her free choice on another man. She loves Mr. Prosper
                        Roadside."</p>
                     <p>"Fancy of a boarding-school miss," sneered the Colonel. "She will put that
                        aside if you tell her to."</p>
                     <p>"That I never will."</p>
                     <p>"Oh, yes," said Haviland, in the low, muffled tone of an irritated man
                        keeping his temper in hand; "let's lose no time in useless argument. You
                        have always protested at the outset, but in the end found my reasons were
                        excellent. This marriage must be. You have just seen that you cannot satiate
                        Clanmoran with money, and a moment will come when you will have nothing to
                        give him, or when your husband will find where your pin-money goes. Miss
                        Oestervelt velt is wealthy, and I will readily see that her portion mends
                        your deficiency."</p>
                     <p>"I would rather be ruined than saved by such means! Enough, sir. If you
                        persist, I shall go and tell my husband everything. He will understand how
                        much I have suffered, and will forgive me. If not, he would be merciless.
                        Let him drive me away. It is my desert. After the dreadful torments you have
                        overwhelmed me with, no picture can frighten me."</p>
                     <p>At this undreamed-of resistance, down fell the mask of the man of fashion,
                        and the rascal appeared alive with cynicism.</p>
                     <p>"Go, tell Old Bullion all!" said he. "A capital notion, and a great pity it
                        come too late. If you had made a clean breast of it the first day I came to
                        you, your husband might have overlooked it all as a misstep condoned by
                        twenty years irreproachable conduct—for you have been a true wife and a good
                        mother. But when you tell him that you led your pretended nephew to a seat
                        at his table, and let him borrow money of your husband, only think what then
                        will come! Mr. Van Kieft's good-tempered, but if he laughs at such a joke,
                        he <emph>is</emph> the Angel of Wall street, and no two ways about it!"</p>
                     <p>The Colonel spoke truly, and yet his eyes could not make his hearer drop
                        hers.</p>
                     <p>"I see," said he, "you're very much set on dear Mr. Roadside. Between your
                        good fame and the Cashier's flame, you cannot hesitate. Sure enough, when
                        Mr. Van Kieft sets up a separate establishment, and Lucas and
                        What's-his-name, the West Pointer, blush at being your sons, it will be a
                        great alleviation to say: 'The good clerk is happy.'"</p>
                     <p>"Come what may, I will do my duty," answered the lady.</p>
                     <p>"You will do what I state," returned the Colonel, breaking forth; "your
                        niece's money is needed by us; and then again, I <emph>love</emph> your
                        Viandra!"</p>
                     <p>The shot had gone off, after so many blank discharges, and the Colonel
                        thought it wise to let time show what it had struck. So he bowed coldly and,
                        turning away, said:</p>
                     <p>"I believe you are quite reasonable enough to keep our secret close."</p>
                     <p>Nevertheless, when he had gone, the poor lady rose, inflamed by the best
                        resolutions.</p>
                     <p>"Yes! I will go tell all to Andrew," she said.</p>
                     <p>But at that moment rose unexpectedly before her the pale and cold
                        statue-like figure of Viandra.</p>
                     <p>"Aunt Van Kieft," said she, with eyes swimming in tears, "you must obey that
                        man! I have heard all! and I beg you to let me save you——"</p>
                     <p>"If you have listened—you must hate Mr. Haviland."</p>
                     <p>"I scorn him. He is, and he will ever be, in my eyes, the lowest of cowards,
                        and yet I will wed him."</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Van Keift, in a bewildered manner, was estimating the greatness or such
                        devotion.</p>
                     <p>"As for Prosper," went on the girl, stifling a sob, "he will be nothing to
                        me after to-morrow."</p>
                     <p>"No!" cried the banker's wife; "no, never shall it be said that I left you,
                        an innocent girl, take the burden of my wrong-doing upon you."</p>
                     <p>"No one must say to me, aunt," replied the noble, brave-hearted girl,
                        shaking her head sadly, "that I let dishonor enter this house, my own home
                        when I could oppose it. I owe you more than life; I would have been a poor
                        girl but for you, and I owe to Uncle Andrew the fortune that that wretch
                        desires. Are not Lucas and Abel my brothers? When your good name is in
                        question, am I to hesitate? No! I will marry Mr. Haviland! I stand alone,
                        while you, my dear aunt, belong to your husband and children. Think of
                        uncle's grief if he were to hear of this. He would go mad!"</p>
                     <p>As the avalanche dates from the first fall of a snowflake, so does one
                        misstep become perhaps the pathway to crime. After having sacrificed her
                        lover to her mother, she sacrificed her husband and children to Burnett
                        Clanmoran, and now Viandra was self-immolated.</p>
                     <p>Out of the wrong depot on life's line there is only one clear track—the
                        return to truth.</p>
                     <p>"What would your life be with such a man?" said Mrs. Van Kieft,
                        wavering.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, he says he loves me," answered Viandra, affecting a hopefulness far
                        from her heart. "Perhaps he will not make me wretched."</p>
                     <p>"Oh, if I only knew where to find a large sum of money. That's all the man
                        wants."</p>
                     <p>"But for Mr. Clanmoran, who spends it so fast. If we could only believe in
                        the Colonel's sincerity! I would like to know if he really cares so very
                        much for his nephew. If he obtains my money, may he not go away from all of
                        us? Then there is a heavy suspicion on my mind."</p>
                     <p>She paused, halting between the fear of paining one that she loved and the
                        desire to enlighten her.</p>
                     <p>"I wish," said she at last, "I wish to be very certain, that is, quite sure
                        that Colonel Haviland and Mr. Clanmoran are not but too intimate—that they
                        are not working a plot in company."</p>
                     <p>Passion is blind and deaf. Though Mrs. Van Kieft had remarked suspicious
                        facts, yet now she only saw a greatly mistaken surmise.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, no," said she; "the Colonel is really vexed at the young man's
                        wildness, and never gave him anything but good advice. Burnett is vain,
                        prodigal, too easy, but he has a good heart. Prosperity has intoxicated him;
                        but he loves me. It you were only to see and hear him when I reproach him,
                        all your suspicions would fly away. If he does not keep the promises to be
                        more reasonable that he makes me, with tears in his eyes, it is because
                        false friends lead him away."</p>
                     <p>Mothers always serve it up hot to their sons' friends as being the really
                        guilty.</p>
                     <p>Viandra was too generous to even try to undeceive her aunt.</p>
                     <p>"I hope to heaven you are right," murmured she; "my marriage will not be
                        useless."</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Van Kleft spoke of gaining time, but Viandra led her to the mirror and
                        bid her look.</p>
                     <p>The banker's wife was but a shadow of her former self. She had come to that
                        perfidious age when a woman's beauty, like the glow of a full-blown rose,
                        fades in one day.</p>
                     <p>In four months she had grown old. Sorrow had left upon her brow its imprint.
                        Wrinkles appeared and white lines glistened in her hair.</p>
                     <p>"Now," said Miss Oestervelt, "now you understand why there should be no
                        delay. You have changed so much that I perceived it, and it's a wonder that
                        uncle has not also observed."</p>
                     <p>That evening Colonel Haviland must have been on the top of the waves, by the
                        note he received, whose postscript was by Miss Oestervelt. The next day she
                        took Roadside into privacy and, abusing her ascendancy over him, drew from
                        him that promise to never see her again, and, besides, to make it appear
                        that he was the sole cause of the rupture. Though he implored her to give
                        some reason for the exile, she would only answer that her honor and
                        happiness depended on his obedience. So he had gone away with death in his
                        soul.</p>
                     <p>Almost immediately the Colonel came, by invitation, to supper, and he
                        hastened, in good policy, to tell Mrs. Van Kieft that now he had the pledge
                        of her and her niece, they need not be in haste. He said he knew that Mr.
                        Van Kieft had no great liking for him. But to himself, he thought that he
                        would act the moment when a serious want of money should<pb n="66-67"
                           xml:id="VAC8328-00000034"/> make them wish to hasten the marriage.
                        Burnett, gradually casting off hypocrisy, rarely came to see his mother but
                        when he was out of funds.</p>
                     <p>"It's a singular thing," observed Mr. Van Kieft, at table, turning to
                        Girard: "I mean what happened to me to-day. Have you any name sakes in the
                        army?"</p>
                     <p>"Not that ever I heard of, at least."</p>
                     <p>"Why, I have had twenty thousand dollars, as exchange stands, sent on by my
                        Liverpool correspondents, in favor of a gentleman who is to come on in the
                        next steamer. His name is Colonel Haviland."</p>
                     <p>The Colonel had marvellous self-command, and had drilled his features into
                        keeping his feelings secret, but this intelligence was so overpowering that
                        his color went like a girl's.</p>
                     <p>"There are plenty Havilands," faltered he, "but there's only myself on the
                        army rolls of the Texan Volunteers, I guess."</p>
                     <p>Van Kieft was not sorry to plague a man whom he had heard talking often too
                        haughtily of money-spinners.</p>
                     <p>"Well," said he, in a cutting tone, "I don't know much about the Colonel
                        part. This twenty thousand comes from the sale of a tea brig he came to
                        Liverpool in from the Hooghly."</p>
                     <p>"Oh, he's a trader from China, eh?" said Colonel Haviland, smiling over to
                        Clanmoran. "What's the rest of his name?"</p>
                     <p>"I don't remember. It's down in the letters, of course, but I paid no
                        attention to it. As he has placed the money in my hands, at six months'
                        call, why, of course, he comes home to stay."</p>
                     <p>"Ah! no doubt you will will have him here to dine, and I'll make his
                        acquaintance."</p>
                     <p>The conversation turned on something else before the capitalist's wife had
                        her attention aroused.</p>
                     <p>But Viandra had seen Clanmoran start in his chair, and the Colonel had not
                        become calm again too soon for her too perceive his emotion. Yet, what was
                        it to her—this confirmation of something being wrong?</p>

                        THE HELM.</head>
                     <p>The 'Nymede has carried Morgan Haviland to St. Thomas.</p>
                     <p>He was landed there with about eight hundred dollars in pocket.</p>
                     <p>In no desire to remain, he shipped before the mast in a Baltimore
                        three-masted schooner, whose captain, Swarth, had told him he was glad to
                        have such a well-built, bold fellow as Captain Gordon represented his
                        passenger to be.</p>
                     <p>The Skystone had not been ten hours in the offing before Morgan found that
                        it had been wise of him to wear his little money about him in a belt. The
                        crew was a collection of the A 1 scamps of all nations. Luckily there was no
                        leisure for brown studies. It took all his powers to master the tasks whose
                        novelty made them exacting. There lay his cure.</p>
                     <p>Physical fatigue calmed and benumbed his mental sufferings. When he turned
                        in, with aching shoulders and back, he fell into sound sleep.</p>
                     <p>If his thoughts ever strayed back to the plantation, where he had strolled
                        with his beloved, it was when the wind was fair and no hand was needed to
                        touch tack or sheet.</p>
                     <p>He had sworn to return in three years with a fortune; but swift as is winged
                        desire, slow is reality, crawling along the ground.</p>
                     <p>Now perhaps Capt. Swarth meant to go to Valparalso, as his papers
                           (<emph>one</emph> set, at least,) affirmed; but he went a deuce of a long
                        way about it.</p>
                     <p>It turned out, one noon, that he had an engagement with a negro prince on
                        the Guinea coast, who, in exchange for Jamaica, and several hundred stand of
                        flint "Brummagems," would see that he had enough <emph>ebony poles</emph> to
                        fill the broad hold of the Skystone.</p>
                     <p>This revelation filled Morgan with shame and anger, Southerner though he
                        was; but he was wise enough to know that all his eloquence could not disgust
                        the skipper with a traffic so profitable on account of the Red Cross
                        cruisers.</p>
                     <p>His messmates had a pretty high opinion of him, since he had, with a
                        handspike only, got the better of two Spaniards, who had undertaken to knife
                        him in a brawl. But not one of them would have struck hands with him if he
                        had lifted his voice against blackbirding.</p>
                     <p>He made up his mind to quit at the first port but the chance for that did
                        not come.</p>
                     <p>In three mouths' time it was found that Morgan was too much of the "lawyer"
                        for tarry palms, and Swarth took a liking to him, and they played poker and
                        old sledge together under the atter-awning, in the long calms.</p>
                     <p>The first officer being reported missing (having run against a bulrush
                        spear, said the men, one night when he had gone ashore alone to study the
                        female Africans), Swarth gave Morgan the berth, and he filled it well. The
                        run home was to the Brazilian coast, where they landed eight hundred
                        sound-conditioned, "<unclear>mdse</unclear> sorted," without more loss than
                        usual to the lucky clippers.</p>
                     <p>Lying at Rio to refit, the Skystone's master heard that a French barque,
                        riding close to him, was laden with three thousand breech-loaders, a new
                        patent, rejected by the Imperial Minister of War as not being up to the
                        mark, though they were thought good enough for the Brazilians. The peculiar
                        cartridge cases and bullets for working up a large quantity of powder, were
                        in boxes with them. With the usual celerity of decision proper to Brazil the
                        Dashing, the French supercargo and agent of the invention had been kept
                        dancing attendance, with a pocket full of cartridges and a specimen gun, for
                        the previous eight months, while each home letter blew him up for not
                        selling the firearms at any loss. Swarth made inquiries, got a gun, went off
                        on the hills south of the city, and blazed away at rocks and trees till the
                        mulatto cattle-tenders ran behind their broadest-backed cows each morning
                        the captain appeared. The result being satisfactory, he hauled off and on
                        until a moment when the Mossoo was down in the trough of despond at having
                        been recommended to still another goldlaced functionary, and made a cash
                        offer. The Frenchman closed at once, drank till all was blue with the
                        "generous American of the States United," and shed tears on the figure-head
                        of his vessel when the Skystone ærol ted out of the harbor, chockful of the
                        breech-loaders.</p>
                     <p>The three-master went straight to the Indian Archipelago. Swarth hailed
                        every craft for news, and whenever he heard that the creese swingers of any
                        stated island had just <unclear>plundered</unclear> a rich vessel, he went
                        thither, had a confab with the pirate chief, shot off one of the
                        breech-loader's ten loads in eight seconds, and swapped for miscellaneous
                        goods. With a third of the original three thousand on hand, the Skystone's
                        master hied him to China.</p>
                     <p>As usual, the rebels were beating gongs and letting off rockets against the
                        Imperialists. Swarth ran past the former up the first river navigable to his
                        clipper, and sold his patent articles as a "Yankee pigeon" of a novel breed
                        for so much hard cash and so many of their own muskets in exchange.
                        Returning, he let the rebels stop him, and all their interpreter could got
                        out of him was that he had a lot of muskets that he was willing to sell.
                        This done, he had but to wait at Canton for completing his cargo with
                        tea.</p>
                     <p>While at the rebel camp Morgan had met a Frenchman, a man who had seen him
                        when he had once been to the Crescent City.</p>
                     <p>Spite of the deleterious effects of contact with the ignoble, there was a
                        good deal of the proud and commanding spirit of Haviland left. Though the
                        sea, the breeze and sun had darkened and blackened and hardened his skin, as
                        the companionship of hang-dogs (who might have had many heavy charges
                        sheeted home against them) had calloused his heart, yet he had never settled
                        down into the roving life.</p>
                     <p>He divided with Captain Swarth, who had no need, on a peaceful homeward
                        voyage, of his invaluable second, and stayed in the Celestial Empire. He
                        joined the insurgent ranks with the Frenchman, and, thanks to his bravery,
                        daring, inventive turn of mind, and personal charm, became, in time, a big
                        Red Button among the almond-eyed.</p>
                     <p>So flitted by the three years he had himself fixed for his absence; but,
                        though he had not forgotten Allantina, and still wished for her, she was not
                        the only woman in his mind, though she might still be the most beloved. He
                        wrote to a friend of his at Georgetown. An age afterward the answer came, to
                        tell him that things about home looked much as usual; that his father was
                        dead, his brother Girard had sold pretty nearly everything and gone to the
                        war, that Miss Fretberry was North with her mother, and "engaged to some
                        Yankee money-lender." As for Morgan himself, there were two verdicts of
                        "wilful murder" standing on record against him.</p>
                     <p>This letter made another man of him.</p>
                     <p>Henceforward he stood alone in the world, a "man without a country,"
                        dishonored by a judicial decree. His beloved wedded, there was no aim left
                        for his life. What could he believe in, now that the girl of his heart had
                        renounced him? What kind of a thing was patience, when she had not had
                        strength enough to wait for him?</p>
                     <p>In his despair he almost regretted the Skystone's deck. That was a mans
                        life, full of ups and downs, perils and triumphs, among felons of the sea
                        who might die on bags of doubloons, or with no footing under, five yards
                        over the water from the vard arm.</p>
                     <p>But he was not of the bendable sort, who think of suicide when things happen
                        contrary to their belief.</p>
                     <p>"I'll go in for piling up money," cried he in his rage; "for money, though
                        it melts from you, never 'goes back' on you!"</p>
                     <p>Thereupon he set to work with fierce activity, spurred each day by a
                        freshness of will. All the means to turn a dollar that the flowery kingdom
                        presented Morgan tried. Five times he went to sleep rich and awoke a ruined
                        man; but with the spring of the palmetto back to place when the hurricane
                        had past, he stood up to his task again.</p>
                     <p>In the end, after many long years of struggles, he had made his "plum."</p>
                     <p>He had been wont to say that he meant to die among the pigtails, and have
                        gold paper burnt over him; but he forgot that love of native land which
                        never dies out of the American's heart.</p>
                     <p>The thought grew upon him that he must see <emph>his</emph> "Naples and
                        die."</p>
                     <p>Realizing all his estate, he sent it forward into continental investments,
                        and on reaching London retransmitted to America.</p>
                     <p>More than a score of years had gone by when he touched American soil for the
                        first time since he had left his father's plantation, coming off the
                        ferry-boat between the Cunarder and the slip.</p>
                     <p>He had gone away a youth with a head full of hopeful fancies. He returned a
                        white-headed man, believing in nothing save the virtues of money.</p>
                     <p>His health had been affected. The close atmosphere of London had shortened
                        his stay there, and articular rheumatism had made the Scotia's surgeon
                        seriously alarmed about him on the passage.</p>
                     <p>He was advised by the first New York physician he consulted to go down
                        South. He went as far as Baltimore, till he had become re-acclimatized.</p>
                     <p>When well he felt that inactivity would kill him. Speaking of the devices he
                        had employed in China in cannon-casting, an acquaintance made in a Baltimore
                        hotel went into raptures over their value, forced him to take out patents,
                        introduced him to a broken-down Jersey man who was hanging to Congressmen's
                        coat-tails, and at last led him to buy the Shiner's Bay Iron Works, N.
                        J.</p>
                     <p>Morgan was enchanted at the first inspection of his property. There was a
                        view of the sea, a view of woods and peach-orchards; and the roaring draft,
                        the fiery sparks and the volume of smoke, ever belching from the tall
                        furnace-chimney, supplied the giant life that he needed to rouse him. He had
                        not been many weeks installed there, when his servant came into the
                        sitting-room of his villa, near the foundry, to give him the card of a
                        gentleman who wished to see him.</p>
                     <p>The name was <q>
                           <p>"GIRARD HAVILAND,<lb/> (Late Colonel Texas Volunteers").</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>It was many years since Morgan had felt such a shock. His blood rushed to
                        his head; he could see nothing out of his wide-open eyes unless it was a
                        false, black pall, and he staggered like a ship's mast when all its spread
                        of canvas has by mischance been taken aback.</p>
                     <p>Feelings that he believed dead arose with unheard-of violence. A thousand
                        thoughts, too confused for utterance, crowded upon him faster than words
                        could keep pace. "My brother! my brother Girard!" he gasped, leaving his
                        servant agape and not a little frightened at his excitement, and ran out to
                        the front-door.</p>
                     <p>In the entry stood a man—Girard Haviland—waiting. Morgan rushed to him,
                        grasped his hand as if to crush the four knuckles into one, and rather
                        carried, than even dragged, him back to the sitting-room.</p>
                     <p>There he forced him into a seat, drew a chair up as close to him as
                        possible, to contemplate him more at his ease. He kept both his hands in
                        both his own.</p>
                     <p>"You, is it?" he repeated, speaking loudly, as if to hear himself better.
                        "You? my brother Girard!"</p>
                     <p>Morgan, whose life had been one continued typhoon, was no master of himself
                        now. He the slaver, the first officer to Captain Swarth, the drill-master of
                        Chinese troops, one of the Fredericks whom Carlyle so belauds, was crying
                        and laughing at the same time.</p>
                     <p>"I would have known you anywhere," said he to his brother. "Your face has
                        not changed, you have your old look and smile."</p>
                     <p>Indeed, Girard was smiling, much as he had that night when the stumble of
                        his horse had all but destroyed Morgan.</p>
                     <p>He looked as happy as he was, indeed, for it had taken all his daring to
                        force himself into his brother's presence.</p>
                     <p>When he saw Morgan dark along the hall toward him, he knew not with what
                        intentions, he had felt very like running away.</p>
                     <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC8328-00000035"/>
                     <p>But now that he found Morgan to be as trusting and kindly to him as ever,
                        and as unaware of Girard's true nature as could be, he might well feel
                        overjoyed.</p>
                     <p>"So I ain't a lone derelict on the seas," said Morgan, "I have some one to
                        care for—some one who cares for me."</p>
                     <p>He interrupted himself to abruptly inquire, with that incoherence of ideas
                        caused by strong emotions stiring the brain:</p>
                     <p>"Are you married, Girard?"</p>
                     <p>"No!"</p>
                     <p>"I am sorry, deuced sorry to hear so. I'd have liked to 'a' seen you the
                        husband of some good woman, with happy children around you. I'd have dressed
                        up ship to have welcomed ye aboard! I'd have made your family mine own.
                        Life, without a woman to share one's pleasures and successes, ain't life at
                        all. It's black as pitch or the inky clouds over the Bight of Benin, to be
                        staring out for'a'd for your own self. But hang all this! I've got you!
                        Girard, old brother, it's a gay thing to have somebody you can speak aloud
                        to, instead of having to overhaul the log all by one's self. You ain't
                        married, eh? All right! We'll live together like two merry old
                           <emph>baches.</emph> There's <emph>boy</emph>-ancy in the old hulk yet.
                           <hi rend="i"/>Kala panee! what a curious notion's struck me! You have
                        grown young. 'Been drinking <hi rend="i"/>obeah water, sah?' You make me
                        young—I'd swear it was only last week I raced through the cane and jumped
                        into the Big Pedee. Yet that's many vy'ges back, and I've been through a
                        good deal——"</p>
                     <p>"Pshaw! you bear less trace of time than I," said Girard.</p>
                     <p>"No joke?"</p>
                     <p>"Honest truth."</p>
                     <p>Girard was right: he appeared rather worn out than aged; for Morgan, spite
                        of his silvered hair and his dark hue, was a robust man in the full maturity
                        of manly beauty. While the Texan Colonel's pale face was flickered over by a
                        caustic smile, the Chinese Colonel's brown features shone with frankness,
                        and his eyes were clear and bright.</p>
                     <p>"How did you come to come down on me?" queried the latter. "What
                        signal-lantern led you hereaway?"</p>
                     <p>"Providence," answered Girard, who had bad time to get all his replies in
                        order while on the way down to Shiner's Bay by the Port Monmouth Railroad.
                        "I was at a meeting of the Oatman Lodge last Monday, and a young fellow who
                        had come up from Long Branch mentioned your name in connection with casting
                        steel, etc. It struck me as so strange to hear of an American, another Col.
                        Haviland, that I wasn't easy till I ran down to look at you. The
                        stage-driver from Red Bank told me your first name was Morgan, and you may
                        be sure that put my heart into a flutter like a rice-bird's wings."</p>
                     <p>"How is it you never found a way to write to me?"</p>
                     <p>Girard assumed the distreased air of a man forced to speak unpleasantly.</p>
                     <p>"I only learned that you were not dead some six months ago, and as nothing
                        had been heard of you for twenty years, I gave up hope."</p>
                     <p>"Miss Fretberry, then, did not tell you I was off sale? She promised to let
                        father know. So she had the barbarity to let you mourn for me and let father
                        die of grief? She must have had a keen fear of what folks would say, to
                        sacrifice me to her reputation."</p>
                     <p>"But how is it you never wrote?"</p>
                     <p>"I wrote as soon as I could, and the answer—it came from Luke James of the
                        River House—ran that father was no more, and you had left that part——"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, I joined the Lone Star movement, thinking you dead."</p>
                     <p>Morgan rose and paced the room to shake off his gloominess.</p>
                     <p>"Bast!" said he, "let by-gones sink, and none cast a rope's end to them. All
                        the memories in the world can't turn the scale against the smallest hope,
                        and we've got a bright stretch of open sea before us. But I'm dreadful
                        talky, ain't I, Girard! ha, ha! Have you had dinner?"</p>
                     <p>"I must confess I haven't."</p>
                     <p>"Why in thunder didn't you say so? No more have I. A pretty thing, to put a
                        brother on allowance the first day you see him. There's some Cape wine I've
                        had along with me since '57—you shall swim in it!"</p>
                     <p>He rang the bell, and in a moment the little household was on foot. Half an
                        hour afterward the brothers were attending to a very fair repast.</p>
                     <p>Their conversation was next to endless, as Girard had to tell all that had
                        transpired since Morgan had been away.</p>
                     <p>"I sold the property," the Colonel said at last; "the old plantation, the
                        old house, though father died there!"</p>
                     <p>"Avast!" cried Morgan, seing how sad was the other. "Memory clings to the
                        heart and not to old stones. I havn't dared to go to George-town. I'm afraid
                        I'll suffer too much at the sight of the trees of Fretberry Wood. Alas! the
                        sun-dial of my happiness, only marking the sunny hours of my life, was
                        there."</p>
                     <p>Girard's countenance lightened. This certainty of Morgan's not having been
                        home drove away one of his most pressing anxieties. At two in the morning
                        they were still chatting.</p>
                     <p>The next day Girard went over to Red Bank and sent a line to New York by the
                        Meta. It was to Burnett Clammoran, and ran thus:</p>
                     <p>"Be prudent. Follow my instructions. All well. Hope for the best."</p>
                     <p>All went well, and yet, spite of all his shrewdly-calculated questions,
                        Girard had not obtained the information he had come for.</p>
                     <p>Morgan, so open that he had unveiled his whole life, dwelling upon the
                        slightest incidents, had not let one spark appear to enlighten him. Girard
                        wondered whether it was by chance or calculation, wise premeditation or
                        simple forgetfulness, with all the anxiety of a perverse man always
                        attributing like perversity to his fellows.</p>
                     <p>At any risk, even if he had to step beyond his reserve, he was determined to
                        see clearly into his brother's mind.</p>
                     <p>"So far, Morgan," said he, lying back in his chair at the dessert; "so far
                        we have talked about everything, except serious matters."</p>
                     <p>"You don't say so? What makes you look like a British captain starting a
                        middy to psss the word for piping all hands to witness punishment?"</p>
                     <p>"Why, my dear brother, believing that you had 'shuffled off this mortal
                        coil,' I pocketed all the money the homestead brought me."</p>
                     <p>"Is that what you call a serious matter?" cried Morgan, with a roar of
                        hearty laughter. "You'd better shut up the book at that chapter. You must be
                        very rich, or think me very high in the water, if you pay over that seam
                        many more times.</p>
                     <p>Girard started slightly. How could he answer without letting out something
                        certain?</p>
                     <p>"I can't say I'm rich," said he, "and I won't say I'm poor."</p>
                     <p>"I'd be glad if you were so poor that you had'nt breath in your body to shoo
                        a dog off," said Morgan smiling, "so that there's be more merit in my
                        offering to share with you. Are you quite over? Let's have a look at my—I
                        mean our—works."</p>
                     <p>While following his brother, Girard was as tormented as could be, for he
                        fancied that Morgan was avoiding, with singular persistency, the very ground
                        of the confidences he sought to up root. The Colonel's distrust was aroused,
                        and he almost regretted his "oh be joyful" message overnight. But none of
                        his perplexed thoughts appeared on his radiant face or in his pleasant
                        voice.</p>
                     <p>He was shown everything—the villa, the stables, the garden, the grove of
                        chestnuts, the ocean as it stretched out beyond the limit of view; and, down
                        by the waterside, with a landing-stage heaped up with casting-sand, wood for
                        mould-frames, and packing, coal and clinker, the foundry itself. It was to
                        be enlarged in the spring, said Morgan. There were thirty men and boys at
                        work, as it was, and a good-sized engine was steadily turning its wheels,
                        Morgan, still under the spell of the enchantment of having intelligent men
                        under his orders—in heu of the "Johns," who picked up knowledge quickly
                        enough, but never went at their work like Europeans—spared his brother not a
                        file or a sledge. He expatiated on his future plans—how he expected a new
                        furnace he meant to build would save half the fuel—how he had a new
                        composition to turn out iron castings with a smoother face than silver—how
                        he could do this and would do that.</p>
                     <p>Girard applauded, but answered in monosyllables. Such prosperity made his
                        eyes smart, and comparing his fate with his brother's, jealousy's venomed
                        needles riddled his envious heart. Seeing Morgan rich, looked up to by
                        honest workmen, honored, reaping the reward of a life, tireless, at all
                        events, he shuddered at what he had brought himself to.</p>
                     <p>From twenty years before, the vile, shameful antipathy he had to his
                        brother, returned.</p>
                     <p>"What do I think of your purchase, Morgan? Why," replied Girard, "you have
                        the taste of a Southerner and the 'cuteness of a Downeaster, to have found
                        such a bargain."</p>
                     <p>"Glad you like it! Don't you go away! Or if you must see noisy New York,
                        once in a while, we'll go up to town together for a fortnight, eh? You are a
                        single man, and you shan't want for anything here. When we can't go out
                        fishing, boating, shooting, we'll have the foundry to look after. I'll teach
                        you the tricks of the trade, so that the Corn'all miners wouldn't blacken
                        your phiz if they caught you in the glare of a smelting-run. Does the plan
                        suit?"</p>
                     <p>A year before, such an offer would have crazed Girard with joy. What a
                        delightful repose, after so many transgressions and "shakes!" He might have
                        cast off the adventurer's coat and turned Jersey farmer at once. But he
                        raged now to think that he could not accept. He was not free and could not
                        leave Gotham, where he had gone into a game from which rising was losing,
                        and the loss would be a fatal matter. He might have slipped away, if alone,
                        but he had an accomplice.</p>
                     <p>"Well, Morgan, I don't exactly see any objection, but I'm in a sort of
                        commission business in Manhattan, and that's all my income."</p>
                     <p>"Is that your hindrance? Pretty to come from you who wanted me last night to
                        take back half the old plantation brought. I don't like this, Girard! You
                        must have mistaken me, or you ain't the best of brothers!"</p>
                     <p>The Colonel hung his head, for Morgan was turning the dagger in the
                        wound.</p>
                     <p>"Do you think you'll be a burden to me? You're out of your head. Did I not
                        tell you that I was well to do? This foundry and the villa don't stand for a
                        quarter of what I own. Do you think, in such a speculation, I would have
                        bought a ruined man's property with twenty years' savings! I could raise a
                        million against your dry-goods man in New York—what's his name?—ay, and the
                        odd five hundreds over. One bank in New York has got twenty thousand of mine
                        in hand, the first of five remittances my Liverpool correspondent is sending
                        over as the exchange favors."</p>
                     <p>Girard started with pleasure. At last he was going to learn in what quarter
                        the blow was coming.</p>
                     <p>"The bank is run by only one man, but he stands so well that I guess I'll
                        let him have all that lot. That's a sum I mean to leave alone, a sort of
                        nest-egg."</p>
                     <p>"It might be tempting. You say he ain't a friend?"</p>
                     <p>"Don't know him from Adam. Mentioning Adam, his name is Adam—oh, no, it
                        ain't!—that's funny!—it's Andrew—Andrew Von Kief——"</p>
                     <p>"Van Kieft. oh, yes!"</p>
                     <p>"Do you know him?"</p>
                     <p>"By name. He's well known on Wall street. His bank is on Broadway a fine,
                        new building—"</p>
                     <p>"I'll have a look at it."</p>
                     <p>"Eh?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes! The last time I was in New York. I was laid up and saw nothing of it.
                        I'll go up with you, and, while you are settling your affairs to return with
                        me, I'll go around a little."</p>
                     <p>Upon this unexpected announcement of an intention whose realization would
                        ruin him, Girard had a difficult task to dwell unmoved, but the
                        consciousness of the other's eyes being upon him strengthened him.</p>
                     <p>"Very well."</p>
                     <p>"I'll tell you the truth. I don't like noise and bustle now. I've seen my
                        peck of it, but I've wanted to go there since some time. It occurs to me
                        that some of the captains of Spofford's or the opposition line may be
                        Charlestonians that we may know, and p'raps they'd tell me something
                        about—about Miss Fretberry."</p>
                     <p>"Ah!"</p>
                     <p>"Steamship captains are good as a directory sometimes."</p>
                     <p>"After twenty years, you want to try and find out the woman who jilted
                        you—"</p>
                     <p>"Don't use that word, Girard! I want to see her because I loved her once.
                        That's the truth. If I don't find one of the 'big-prawn eaters' <unclear>to
                           hum</unclear>, I must write up old Luke James again, I suppose."</p>
                     <p>Girard made no reply, as is usual with men of his caliber when an unforeseen
                        card comes up and threatens to turn the vein. They know the influence an
                        apparently meaningless bit of advice may have, and avoid uttering a word
                        before they have studied its bearings and consequences.</p>
                     <p>Especially did Girard hold back from discussing his brother's project. To
                        gainsay a man's intentions almost always drives them deeper into his
                        mind—arguments having the effect of hammer-strokes.</p>
                     <p>So he changed the subject, and the day passed without any further reference
                        to Allantina or to New York.</p>
                     <p>After dinner he went out for a stroll along the road. It ran up and down,
                        affording a view of the sea, with glimpses of the villas among trees on the
                        other hanp.</p>
                     <p>Girard thought his case hard.</p>
                     <p>All the while he had been at war with society he lived by his boldness,
                        drawing his revenue from the well of credulity and human folly. Since he had
                        wandered on the edge of legal precipices Girard Haviland had been in many a
                        scrape. He had been caught at heavy games with a hand of marked cards; he
                        had been dogged by police; he had changed his name so often that he could
                        answer to anything from Abe to Zack; he had sold cowards his tricks in
                        pistol-shooting or "upper-cuts;" he had been locked up when most
                        disreputable dens were "pulled," and he had miraculously escaped.</p>
                     <p>He had braved all manner of things, and feared nothing.</p>
                     <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC8328-00000036"/>
                     <p>However guilty the plans he might conceive, he was capable of coolly
                        carrying them out.</p>
                     <p>And yet he stood now without his habitual impudence to support him.</p>
                     <p>On all sides, danger-columns showed their advancing scouts.</p>
                     <p>He had equally to dread Van Kieft, his wife, and his niece; Morgan might
                        wish to avenge himself when the truth should come out; his ally, Burnett
                        Clanmoran, would turn on him like Actæion's hounds.</p>
                     <p>What human means prevented Morgan from finding his old love and seeing her?
                        None. And their meeting would be his death-warrant.</p>
                     <p>"McHoughlin himself can't drive a horse straight round the turn of a track,"
                        muttered he, stopping and turning to go back; "I'll hatch up some story or
                        other, borrow as near fifty thousand dollars as I can, and—by George! the
                        man can have it who can catch me after I get an hour's start!"</p>
                     <p>He stood up by the roadside to let the stage from Red Bank come by.</p>
                     <p>"Pray, driver," said a voice that made Girard look up, "what's that smoky
                        shanty down there, spoiling the prospect with soot?"</p>
                     <p>"That! That's Colonel Haviland's foundry—that's goin' to be the makin' of
                        Shiner's Bay!</p>
                     <p>"Colonel Haviland!" repeated the first voice.</p>
                     <p>Girard staggered back. Through the dust he saw the speaker, sitting next to
                        the straw-hatted driver.</p>
                     <p>He had turned in his seat as if to look round on the iron-works, but his
                        mocking eyes were really bent on the Colonel, who recognized Burnett
                        Clanmoran!</p>

                        TREATY—MORGAN'S DEATH.</head>
                     <p>Girard walked home like an automaton.</p>
                     <p>What brought Clanmoran down there? Why was he dressed like a frame, from the
                        doorway of a clothing store, in a "new style tourist's suit?"</p>
                     <p>He had written to him, but had not been alarmed at having had no reply.</p>
                     <p>Had some dish "flown" in the oven—some band leaped off the wheel in New
                        York? Had a mesh of the net enfolding Mrs. Van Kieft parted asunder? Had
                        Clanmoran been forced to fly, and was he come to "tip him the office?"</p>
                     <p>He could not doubt that it was Burnett whom he had seen.</p>
                     <p>In the evening, when not a sound arose except the croak of frogs, the calls
                        of katydids, and the chirping of crickets, he stole out as if to enjoy a
                        cigar alone. He judged correctly that his accomplice would be hanging about
                        the premises, for he had not gone a hundred yards down the road before a man
                        jumped out of the dry ditch and overtook him.</p>
                     <p>It was a clear night, and Girard recognized Burnett.</p>
                     <p>"What's happened?" cried he, unable to master his impatience.</p>
                     <p>"Nothing, old fellow! If you didn't want to take so much in at a bite, I
                        should say all is getting on capitally."</p>
                     <p>Girard growled, like a dog, with fury.</p>
                     <p>"Then, what brings you here?" snarled he; "why have you come away at risk of
                        ruining the pair of us?"</p>
                     <p>"That's <emph>my</emph> business!" answered Clanmoran, saucily.</p>
                     <p>With a quick movement, Haviland caught the speaker by the wrist, saying
                        hastily:</p>
                     <p>"Give me the reason for your strange caprice!"</p>
                     <p>The young man wrenched himself free with apparent ease, slight as he
                        looked.</p>
                     <p>"Draw it mild, now!" said he, more provokingly than before, "bitter' ain't
                        to my taste, and you'll have my barrels at your tap if you ain't
                        careful."</p>
                     <p>He showed the butt of a revolver.</p>
                     <p>"No <emph>sass,</emph> but tell me what you mean by this!"</p>
                     <p>"Or else, what'll you do? Look here! you'd better once for all, give up any
                        idea of making me afraid. I'm willing to answer you, but not here in the
                        road; the last stage will soon be coming by, and how do you know but eyes
                        are on us. Come on!"</p>
                     <p>They climbed over the stone fence and tramped through a couple of fields,
                        without a care for what they trod under foot.</p>
                     <p>"Now," said Clanmoran, when they were about a gunshot from the highway,
                        "I'll tell my dear uncle what brought me here. I got your letter all right.
                        You wanted to be careful, of course, but you were so careful that I couldn't
                        understand. I could only make out the one thing: a great danger threatens
                        us."</p>
                     <p>"The very reason you should keep quiet."</p>
                     <p>"Beautiful! only I like to know whether the danger comes in the city police
                        hat or the regular helmet—that is, with Municipal's star or Metroplitan's
                        shield. I'm the man to risk myself, but I'm bound to know the penalty of the
                        risk."</p>
                     <p>"I told you to be easy——"</p>
                     <p>Clanmoran stuck his tongue in his cheek.</p>
                     <p>"You mean I ought to put full trust in my dear uncle?"</p>
                     <p>"Certainly. Your doubts are absurd, after all I have done for you. You know
                        blamed well what you were when I picked you up. Who gave you a name and
                        family, when you hadn't either to show, but me? Who is working to give you
                        'promised land,' if not me?"</p>
                     <p>The better to listen, Burnett had struck a grotesquely serious attitude.</p>
                     <p>"Well done! Bravo!" said he. "While you are about it, why don't you prove
                        that you are losing money to benefit me? Didn't you want me when you 'sent
                        for me, and I come?' Make it clear that you are the most generous and
                        disinterested of uncles, and we'll subscribe for monumental marble."</p>
                     <p>Haviland was silent, for he dreaded the extremity to which his anger would
                        carry him.</p>
                     <p>"No, old fel, you'd better drop it," went on Burnett. "I <emph>pal'd</emph>
                        with you because I knew you. I have just as much trust in you as you have in
                        me. If your cab will get along faster with only you inside, you'd shove me
                        through the window like winkin'! When the knock comes at the door, you'll
                        let your dear nephew be collared. No use denying, for its natural, and I'd
                        do just the same in your place! Only, mind you, I ain't a bone to be chucked
                        to the dogs, to check their chasing this easy! So 'make waste' of useless
                        blame, and let's have the lesson of the day——"</p>
                     <p>Girard saw that with such an accomplice a steady hand was needed.</p>
                     <p>So he very explicitly related all that had happened since he had been at his
                        brother's. He was quite frank, except about the figure of Morgan's fortune,
                        which he set low.</p>
                     <p>"Well," said Clanmoran, when he had finished, we have swift bowling against
                        us. Do you expect to carry your bat out to a long score?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, if <emph>you</emph> don't play me false!"</p>
                     <p>"Never played any mate false, colonel. How are you going to make the
                        runs?"</p>
                     <p>"I don't know yet; but I'll find out, for I must. I tell you, you can go
                        back at ease. You run no risk in New York. I'll be there soon, with my
                        brother——"</p>
                     <p>"There? Ah! in the country they're so suspicious picious. But, pray, are you
                        sure I run no risk?"</p>
                     <p>"Of course. Mrs. Van Kieft is held too tight for her to lift her voice. Were
                        she to discover the <emph>truth</emph>—the real fact that you and I alone
                        know—she would keep just as silent, too happy at escaping the penalty of her
                        past fault, the censure of the world and the resentment of her husband."</p>
                     <p>"Right you are," said Clanmoran, becoming serious. "My mother is secure, and
                        so I don't fear her. It's the enemy of your stamp, oh! my prophetic soul, my
                        uncle! an implacable enemy, Viandra Oestervelt. If you think small of her,
                        you're wrong. She has given herself up for her anni's sake, but she is still
                        her own mistress. She has promised to marry you, and she sacked Prosper, who
                        is dying off with grief, but she has not given up all hope. You think her
                        weak, timid, and simple! Don't you do it! English girls of the best society
                        don't know how long an inch is out of their class, but these New York
                        girls—whew! You can't pose them with any questions in geometry or cyclone in
                        the political atmosphere! They give as much time to dress as a <hi rend="i"
                        />pintado of the Bois de Boulogne, and yet find leisure for 'cramming' out
                        of all the papers! How do they do it? It knocks me full length, and I say,
                        gasping, "I don't know."</p>
                     <p>"Stuff!"</p>
                     <p>"Well, anyway, Miss Oestervelt is sharp, firm, thinks quick, and hard times
                        give her experience. She's in love, uncle: and a girl that's spooney, you
                        know, claws for her lover as tirelessly as a fire-proof Brum, stoking out
                        his furnance. There's the rasper, measter!"</p>
                     <p>"She has about a hundred thousand dollars of her own——"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, close on sixty, if suddenly cashed; say thirty thousand apiece. Very
                        pretty, but my opinion is, you'd better let the girl flourish alone."</p>
                     <p>"Never!" exclaimed Haviland. "If she was poor. I'd marry her all the same.
                        It's not her money I'm after <emph>now,</emph> Burnett! I want
                           <emph>her,</emph> for—I <emph>love</emph> her!"</p>
                     <p>Clanmoran drew back a couple of steps, throwing up his arms, and making
                        other demonstrations of surprise.</p>
                     <p>"Is it possible! You love the girl?" he cried.</p>
                     <p>"Yes," replied Girard, suspiciously; "what do you see queer in that?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh, nothing, nothing! Only this explains the unaccountable variations in
                        your conduct. You love her, do you? Heigho! put the cards all back in the
                        box."</p>
                     <p>"What?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes! When a fellow's moon-struck he can't find the right card to put to the
                        play—an old saw, that ought to be down in the school-books. When generals
                        full in love they lose battles. A day will come when Miss Oestervelt will
                        soften you so that you will sell us under market price for a smile. And
                        she's our foe, and she has cat's eyes, and she watches us."</p>
                     <p>With a burst of laughter too loud to be sincere, the Colonel cut short his
                        nephew.</p>
                     <p>"How you flare up!" said he. "Are you sure <emph>you</emph> don't like
                        her?"</p>
                     <p>Clear though the night was, Girard could not see the anger flushing the
                        young man's face.</p>
                     <p>"I never cared a penny for anything a girl had, unless it was money!"</p>
                     <p>"Then what are you squeaking about? Ain't you going to have half the money
                        without the burden of the woman?"</p>
                     <p>"I ain't over forty-five!" sneered the young man, executing a dancing step
                        carelessly.</p>
                     <p>"Enough!" said Haviland. "When I lifted you out of the lowest misery, wasn't
                        it agreed that I would be the leader?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, but you forget that my life, or my liberty at least, is at stake. Deal
                        the cards, and play 'em, but let me prompt you now and then. You needn't be
                        uneasy about me; I've arranged things so that I can prove a neat <foreign
                           xml:lang="LAT">alibi</foreign>—bring a crowd forward to swear I was in my
                        house at Aetoria this blessed minute!"</p>
                     <p>The colonel flung his cigar-end far from him.</p>
                     <p>"I've got two ideas," said he, slowly. "One depends on your assent. Suppose
                        I say, will you agree to leave the country, go back to London, if you like,
                        for a large sum?"</p>
                     <p>"Ahem! what do you call a large sum?"</p>
                     <p>"Thirty thousand dollars."</p>
                     <p>"Three fifty a year!" cried Clanmoran. "Oh, my respected uncle! When a
                        pit-boy at her Majesty's and a first-tier at the Garden take four hundred
                        guiness a season together! And my gloves and my turn-out and my cob! Bless
                        you, I wouldn't dare no more to go near a girl than the oldest <hi rend="i"
                        />dook on the Wellington's books! If the spec don't promise better, I'd be
                        money in pocket by experiments with skeleton-keys at once! Come, come,
                        you're trying to play Old Foxy with me, which isn't fair, after our bargain.
                        It ain't well done, either, for—bear you in mind—I'm up to your every
                        move!"</p>
                     <p>"I don't know what you mean."</p>
                     <p>"I do! and that satisfies me. If you want to stave me off with thirty
                        thousand dollars, it's because you're raffling for a million!"</p>
                     <p>Girard opened his eyes very like an honest man, amazed at a
                        misunderstanding.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, I ain't off my balance!" said the young man, smiling and lighting
                        another cigar. What's that Yankee orator saying? Oh! 'I guide my feet by the
                        lamp of experience, and judge the future by the past.' What have I had out
                        of the money torn from Mrs. Van Kieft—often against my wish? Not the
                        parson's allowance."</p>
                     <p>"It went into our reserve fund."</p>
                     <p>"Which you are the treasurer of, uncle; very true. Words are no men; money
                        is man! If the magazine blows up to-morrow, you'll walk off with the man,
                        while I'll be laid by the heels for want of the blunt. That's right! Call me
                        'ungrateful boy!' Uncles always do in the theater when their nevys are too
                        knavey for them. But, rubbish! I'll show you where you are trying to diddle
                        me. You say your brother is only moderately well off. Why, this other
                        colonel's worth upward of seventy thousand dollars a year, and no talking
                        round it. The house, grounds and foundry yonder cost him two hundred and
                        twenty-three thousand dollars, including water right and option of
                        purchasing the fifty-acre pasture-stand by the tavern, at his own price
                        e'ena'most. He's got twenty thousand only with Van Kieft, but more's
                        a-coming. He more than half promised Dr. Stebbins of this village to build a
                        decent church at his own expense, organ, and black walnutpulpit and Italian
                        marble in the chancel. Don't tell me! If he ain't a millionaire, I'm a
                        beggar, or'll be willing to be; and that's not warm on my heart, you be
                        sure! The deuce and all! you—we had the game all on our side when you lost
                        it by your own great fault."</p>
                     <p>"A man can't command events."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, he can, if he's strong enough! Fools wait for something to turn
                        up—knowing men turn up the trump themselves! When you hunted me up, you
                        settled that we should only get a little help out of my dear mamma, and not
                        use her rough if she behaved kindly. But, hand it! at risk of killing the
                        goose with the golden egg, you have made me so torment the poor lady that
                        she don't know which way to look for the Day of Rest."</p>
                     <p>"We had to move quick."</p>
                     <p>"Grant it. Was it to move quick that you took the fancy to marry Miss
                        Oesterveit? That day roped her into the party, and since that day she has
                        been supporting and advising her aunt;<pb n="72-73"
                           xml:id="VAC8328-00000037"/> ay, setting her up against us. Aunt Sallyi s
                        going to shy the clubs back at our heads! She'll tell Mr. Van Kieft, and I
                        won't wonder at it."</p>
                     <p>"I love Viandra——"</p>
                     <p>"So you said. But that's nothing to do with it! You have pushed us off in a
                        boat without looking to the full supply of oars. It is only muffs, uncle,
                        that can be let say after they'e been picked up at sea: 'I wouldn't have
                        been washed off my deck <emph>if</emph> I had only known!' Such as us
                           <emph>must</emph> know rope, stay and spar. Why the mischief did you give
                        out that my father was dead? Not at all, he lives, and we have built up a
                        regular hedge against my going to him. I have had the dipping into a
                        million, and now won't finger a copper."</p>
                     <p>"Peace!" said Haviland, waving his hand. "I may have compromised it all, but
                        then I have a sure way to save it all."</p>
                     <p>"Eh?"</p>
                     <p>"My second plan."</p>
                     <p>"Ah! what?"</p>
                     <p>"That's <emph>my</emph> business, as you said lately."</p>
                     <p>The silence now reigning between the two men, after the colloquy they had
                        had, was so significant that both of them shuddered. The same abominable
                        thought had come to them, and they knew it was the very same, though no word
                        or token had passed between them.</p>
                     <p>"So," said Girard, first to end the pause, "you refuse the thirty thousand
                        dollars, to go? Reflect, for there is still time."</p>
                     <p>"I have thought is over. I am sure now that you won't try again to throw me
                        over. I can't live out of London, and it takes a full measure of fortune for
                        a youth of my innocence to disturb the stilly night like a gentleman.
                        Between guaranteed respectability in a Jermyn street first floor and
                        probable style in a Park lane town house, I say, 'Give me Park lane liberty,
                        or give me Penitentiary death!' I'll succeed or fail with you, old fellow!
                        I'll obey you 'a good deal better than your norse, and a long sight better
                        than your dog'—Shakespeare, eh? I'm in earnest, though you make me
                        poetical!"</p>
                     <p>The young man rattled on so lightly because he shrank from dwelling on his
                        ally's project. He must have been very, very sure that he had guessed it
                        when he made no inquiry about it. Perhaps be preferred to have the awful
                        certainty a little <emph>mystified</emph> by doubt, by way of blunting the
                        string of remorse in the mental complicity.</p>
                     <p>"In the first place," said Haviland, "you will go back to the city and be
                        kinder than ever you were to Mrs. Van Kieft. Of course, nothing must happen
                        in the house without my knowledge."</p>
                     <p>"That's of course."</p>
                     <p>The Colonel laid his hand on the young man's shoulder, as if to better call
                        his attention to the coming advice.</p>
                     <p>"You have one way," pursued he, "to regain your mother's confidence. It is
                        by heaping all your misbehavior on my shoulders. Do so. The more hateful you
                        make me to Mrs. Van Kieft and Miss Oestervelt, the better you'll serve me.
                        If I can only find no admittance written on the door against me, it will be
                        the very thing. We must appear to be deadly foes. If you do see me once in a
                        while, it will be only because circumstances compel. There's the text,
                        enlarge on it, my boy!"</p>
                     <p>"What!" exclaimed the astounded bearer, "you are in love with a young lady,
                        and think to charm her in that way? That's the curiousest fashion of paying
                        court I ever heard of. Hang me <unclear>if</unclear> I understand."</p>
                     <p>"It aint necessary you should understand," retorted the Colonel: "but,
                        however, you may see the horses' hoofs under the canvas. Did you ever hear
                        of the man who, wanting to have a woman in his arms, set fire to her house
                        one night so as to carry her out? So do I mean to roll the lighted barrel of
                        petroleum into Van Kieft's cellar, figuratively—"</p>
                     <p>"Of course!"</p>
                     <p>"And then come down the ladder with the banker's wife and niece, one on each
                        arm. My deed will appear the more praiseworthy because I was hated and
                        scorned so much. Patience won't wash the drawing off a lithographic stone,
                        but a sudden dash of a sponge of acid will make it look clear for the time
                        being. An abrupt good deed, and it looked like an angel——"</p>
                     <p>"Ahem, certainly!" said the young man, nodding. "Not bad; very good, I mean.
                        It's all plain sailing."</p>
                     <p>"Don't you lose sight of my rival——"</p>
                     <p>"The cashier? No danger there! Poor <emph>bloke!</emph> He's safe enough! he
                        thinks he knows New York because he has lived in it so long. I've opened his
                        eyes for him, fresh from <hi rend="i"/>Belle Bows as I am. He's heart-sick,
                        and he's going to Halifax, figuratively, as you word it, of course! fact is,
                        some days I pity him!"</p>
                     <p>"Pity him all you like, but don't hurt yourself by curing him."</p>
                     <p>With that they parted, to all seeming the best friends in the world, but
                        really hating one another with all their might.</p>
                     <p>Clanmoran could never forgive Haviland for trying to shake him off, when it
                        was Clanmoran who had triumphed over the greatest of their difficulties. On
                        his side Girard was startled by the young man's attitude. Until then he had
                        found him devoted and as submissive as a lieutenant leading his platoon into
                        fire with closed eyes; but here he was putting his colonel through his
                        facings. His nephew's clear-sightedness seemed strange, and he felt
                        indignant at having to let him punctuate the orders he had dashed off
                        previously with his own commas and full stops. Moreover, the young man's
                        slurs at him, the veteran sleeper on the field of green cloth, the Balafie
                        of many <emph>spheres</emph> (billiard balls) had galled him as much as a M.
                        A. might if his most stupid lordling's fag should correct the quantity of
                        some common word in his Latin prize essay.</p>
                     <p>While returning, damp with night dew, to his brother's house, he vowed to be
                        even with the cur who had snapped at him, though for the present he would
                        have to let him trot by his, the bloodhound's side.</p>
                     <p>In the morning Morgan told him that he had written to Georgetown, and, as
                        the answer could just as well follow him to New York, he was quite ready to
                        go on the instant.</p>
                     <p>Girard said "Very well!" delayed over one night, and the two went to the
                        Merchants' Hotel in Dey street, where Girard put up.</p>
                     <p>They spent a Saturday in the Central Park and at the Opera. Sunday morning
                        they went over the water to hear Henry Ward Beecher. In the afternoon Girard
                        went out alone to pay a promised visit to some friend. On his return he was
                        surprised to find his brother had been taken ill at the dinner-table. The
                        doctor in attendance quieted him by assuring them it was only a slight case
                        of diarrhea, caused by a rather immoderate use of water, Morgan no doubt
                        unconsciously imitating the other natives, forgetting that he had not been
                        long enough in the country to drink water between every other bite, as too
                        many natives do.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheless Morgan was very weak in the morning—unable to go out
                        pleasuring, at all events. Girard stayed in. The doctor recommended
                        chlorodyne, and a large bottle was ordered. Its effect seemed good, and
                        Morgan, sitting up to read the papers, insisted that his brother should not
                        be cooped up on account of him.</p>
                     <p>But on Tuesday he was worse, and the two following showed no improvement.
                        Girard was deeply alarmed, and a physician of eminence was expressly found
                        by him to leave his up town patients and come so far away as the hotel.
                        Morgan grew worse; his body was cold, while the blood beat so furiously in
                        his head that his tongue spoke a different word from that his brain had
                        directed; his throat seemed to contract, and to open his mouth was pain.</p>
                     <p>The doctor grew uneasy. He questioned Girard more fully as to the different
                        climates his brother had been in, hemmed and haved, saw blisters, on which a
                        few grains of morphine had been sprinkled, applied to the lower portions of
                        Morgan's body, and finally ordered bathing of the forehead in a preparation
                        of sugar of lead. The patient being so rich, and Girard speaking for him,
                        shrinking from no expense, a nurse was obtained—a superior man, who had been
                        in St. Thomas', London, and could be relied on.</p>
                     <p>During this man's watch, Girard retired for the rest he so much needed,
                        after so much affectionate attention as he had given his brother.</p>
                     <p>In the night, after Morgan had some three hours' sleep—troubled, but still
                        sleep—the nurse found him so much cooler in the head that he thought it
                        considerate of him, as he heard Colonel Girard stirring in the next room, to
                        tap on the wall and tell him of the improvement. Girard was so rejoiced that
                        he rose, undressed as he was, and stood in the door a moment to look over
                        the nurse's shoulder (as the latter stood, a soothing draught in his hand)
                        upon Morgan's wasted face, smoothed with repose.</p>
                     <p>In the morning, so fallacious are the phases of the less common diseases,
                        the course of the malady changed.</p>
                     <p>The hot throbbing in the head had been displaced by a dull sense of weight
                        on the brain, so benumbing, and yet so irritating, that the poor sufferer
                        kept turning, turning, slowly turning his head on the pillow, without
                        finding any position tolerable.</p>
                     <p>The doctor, when he came in the morning, seemed even disconcerted by the
                        alteration. He tasted the sediment in the soothing draft, which had
                        moistened Morgan's lips twice or thrice in the night, requestioned the nurse
                        as to the quantity of chlorodine administered, shook his head, went up as
                        far as the Astor House and had a long talk with the chief clerk of a drug
                        store. On his return he stethoscoped Morgan, found that the lungs were
                        laboring; examined his joints, found that they were knotted; studied the
                        color of the network of swollen lines crossing the white of his eyes, and
                        remained till he revived Morgan by careful leeching, and a large dose of
                        sulphate of quinine.</p>
                     <p>Morgan came to consciousness, indeed, but a mere shadow of himself. In a few
                        hours he had grown ten years older. On powerful frames like his, sickness
                        his more hold, and when it breaks them, the shattering is complete. He who,
                        a fortnight before, appeared to be a hale and hearty man, sat up in bed,
                        curved like a graybeard. Though it was too warm, if anything, in the sick
                        room, his teeth chattered as he told the wet-eyed Girard that a lawyer must
                        be sent for.</p>
                     <p>"Good God! for what?" demanded the Colonel.</p>
                     <p>"Because, brother, I need him. I am very ill. Only cowards and fools let
                        death snatch them away unprepared. I shall only be at ease when I settle my
                        affairs. Send, as I say."</p>
                     <p>It was not that Morgan felt himself very ill, or that his mind was
                        impressionable toward forebodings floating out of medicine phials, as the
                        genil from Solomon's flask; but he was a man who had steered too often
                        within biscuit-toss of death-reefs, not to be prepared to break his back
                        amid the reef after he had flung his treasure buoy into the smooth water
                        within the coral.</p>
                     <p>He had drawn up a will before he left London, Now, his affection for his
                        brother had changed that disposition wholly.</p>
                     <p>In vain Girard remonstrated.</p>
                     <p>"My dear brother," he said, "don't go on with such preparations. It's the
                        change of water, the change of air, as the doctor says. You must go back to
                        the Eastern seas—I'll go with you if it comes to that, eh? I won't have you
                        act so, about a week's illness. Do you think I'll consent to your handing me
                        your pocket-book while you are alive and well—yes, well, spite of drenching
                        with a patent physic."</p>
                     <p>Morgan was not a man to be driven from his determination by words, and,
                        though the nurse thought he had never seen a man so noble as Colonel
                        Haviland, the elder brother went on with his purpose.</p>
                     <p>However, Girard would not yield on one point. Learning that the canceled
                        will had left all the property to Miss Fretberry and hers, he insisted that
                        a condition of the new testament (which was to leave him sole inheritor)
                        should give some portion to a school, or hospital, or church, rather than
                        leave him to carry out a verbal request.</p>
                     <p>After a long and praiseworthy resistance, which displayed his exceptional
                        character and rare disinterestedness, Girard gave in to a document being
                        signed. It was to the effect that, on Girard's dying without direct heirs of
                        his body or intestate, the now bequeathed fortune should go, one-half to
                        Miss Allentina Fretberry, and one-half to the City of Georgetown, for the
                        building, founding and maintenance of a free school to be known as the
                        "Haviland Institute."</p>
                     <p>The paper was made legal, and Girard subscribed another which bound him.</p>
                     <p>If the sick man did not regain health, Girard would be, by human justice—by
                        the decision of the law of the land—the possessor of his brother's immense
                        fortune.</p>
                     <p>The exact figures had been enumerated in the drawing up of the instrument,
                        and the fabulous amount had high crazed the Colonel. It was a sum that he
                        had hardly believed possible for one man to own.</p>
                     <p>And yet this windfall came too late.</p>
                     <p>To the undeserving all gifts come too late.</p>
                     <p>And the sick man did not regain health.</p>
                     <p>He wondered why no answer from Luke James had come among the letters given
                        to him. One that, strange to say, had come from Georgetown, contained a few
                        lines from Antoine, the cripple, reminding himself to Morgan, whom he hoped
                        to see soon "down thare. "But the pen and the ink in Girard's room had been
                        used to write that note! The handwriting agreed with the address, but, then,
                        Morgan did not know the mulatto's scrawl from James' own.</p>
                     <p>Morgan spoke of writing anew. But that second inquiry never was made. The
                        recent three days' lull was but a halt in the dead-march. The ailment
                        reasserted its power with such uncommon fierceness that the doctor let his
                        uneasiness be shown. Hence forward there could only be one termination to
                        the double ill. If the sufferings seemed less, it was only because the
                        racked brain and the convulsed vitals were too spent to struggle as in full
                        vigor. Colder and colder grew the extremities, and the beating of the heart
                        was as in a dream.</p>
                     <p>On the fourteenth day of his prostration, Morgan, who had passed the night
                        just like a corpse, except for a hoarse, horribly unnatural breathing, woke
                        up, as it were, in the morning. A minister, stopping at the hotel, who had
                        been in to see him several times, was called in. Three of his furnace-men
                        and the foreman of his works had come up from the country. Morgan shook
                        hands with them, and asked them to look to his brother for the future. He
                        was left with the minister for some time. The old days on the<pb n="74-75"
                           xml:id="VAC8328-00000038"/> slaver, the fighting in China, other
                        misdeeds, perhaps, rose up against him. Through the door ajar, they heard
                        him say in a rather strong voice at the end:</p>
                     <p>"Wherever I've been, however, they'll give an American credit for standing
                        by his friend, black, red or white, and to his promise, foul or
                        fair—thinking of <emph>me,</emph> you know!"</p>
                     <p>He begged his brother to keep the foundery fires burning, for his sake, all
                        the year round, the Fourth and New Year's and Christmas excepted, kissed
                        him, and fell back on his pillow to die, easily.</p>
                     <p>Girard Haviland was the head of the family, really, as he had erroneously
                        thought himself twenty years before, and was a millionaire.</p>
                     <p>He fell on his knees and wound his arms round the stiffening body. Something
                        fiercer than the most poignant grief seemed to fill his voice as he repeated
                        over and over again for the dead brother to come back. His sobs were deep,
                        and he broke some vessel, for blood tinged the moisture on his lips when
                        they forced him away.</p>

                        IMPOVERISHED RICH.</head>
                     <p>Faithful to his companion's programme, while Girard Haviland was watching by
                        his dying brother, Clanmoran labored to regain Mrs. Van Kieft's heart, to
                        restore her lost confidence, and, in short, to set her at ease again.</p>
                     <p>It was a difficult, but not hopeless undertaking.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Van Kieft had been grief-stricken by Burnett's behavior and terrified
                        by his exactions, but she had never ceased to love him. Whatever he did,
                        whatever he might do, he would be always the offspring of her first love,
                        the living remembrance of that handsome Morgan Haviland who had been master
                        of her heart.</p>
                     <p>She adored her sons Abel and Lucas, but she could not restrain her indulgent
                        weakness for the hapless youth torn from her arms and deprived of maternal
                        caresses and the joys of family. She took his faults upon herself and
                        accepted their responsibility. Burnett had versed himself profoundly in her
                        thoughts before he acted in accordance with them. And never had more
                        resistless seduction been at the service of more detestable wickedness.
                        Under his air of admirable candor the precocious rascal concealed a
                        surprising knack of observation. He could, at pleasure, deck himself with
                        boyish charms and the attractions of simplicity. His voice, manly or
                        winning, was full of all the sweet inflection and thrilling notes which
                        agitate or overcome women.</p>
                     <p>While nothing was heard of Colonel Haviland, Burnett was filling Mrs. Van
                        Kieft with felicity such as she had had no previous idea of.</p>
                     <p>Never had the mother of a family so really innocent, spite of the
                        misadventures resulting from her straying, dreamt of so much enchantment.
                        This motherly love was like an adulterous passion as regarded its
                        transports, its mystery and its excitement. She forgave Clanmoran all his
                        past faults, or, rather, saddled them on Colonel Haviland, whom she
                        understood was in the country.</p>
                     <p>"Now that Burnett has none of his uncle's ill-counsels," she thought, "he
                        shows himself as he is, a noble, affectionate, generous youth, like his
                        father was."</p>
                     <p>Clanmoran carried on the deceit jauntily. He gave his part the attention of
                        a good actor, and he had the gift of most notorious rogues, that of lending
                        himself to his own imposture. Sometimes he couldn't tell whether he was a
                        good fellow who had tried formerly to be bad, or a bad fellow who was trying
                        to seem good.</p>
                     <p>The prudent and distrustful Viandra, without wholly calling in her doubts of
                        the young man, feared that she had been unjust by trusting too much to
                        semblances.</p>
                     <p>Money was out of the question, for the excellent son lived on air.</p>
                     <p>Therefore Clanmoran was triumphing when Morgan's death appeared in the
                        papers, brief, but quite enough to be seen and brought to Mrs. Van Kieft's
                        notice by her watchful niece.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>HAVILAND.—After a short but severe illness. Morgan Haviland, aged 42
                           years, 6 months and 3 days, late Colonel in the Imperial Forces of Whang
                           Fu, China, and officer of the Portuguese Colonies' Order of the "Ship and
                           True Cross." The funeral will take place from his late residence,
                           Plantation Villa, Shiners' Bay, N.J. The friends of his brother, Col.
                           Girard Haviland, Texas Volunteers, are respectfully requested to accept
                           this as invitation.</p>
                        <p>* * * Charleston, S.C., papers please copy.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>In another column of one newspaper Mrs. Van Kieft saw a paragraph as
                        follows:</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>"Our industrious cotemporary, the <title>Sphere,</title> has again failed
                           in its despicable and reprehensible attempts to alarm the city with cries
                           of 'wolf.' The Mr. Haviland who died in the Merchants' Hotel, Dey street,
                           was not a victim to cholera. The case was in the hands of Dr. ——, and
                           would have been another triumph to his skill in subduing the attacks of
                           Summer complaint (though complicated by fever, in this instance). Had not
                           an attendant made a mistake in giving an <emph>undiluted</emph> dose of
                           Dr. Collis Browne's chorodyne. This accident is worth recording, since
                           the enterprising firm of—etc., have imported a large quantity of said
                           invaluable, etc."</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Her grief was too deep for words, and it was fortunate that Burnett was
                        always on his guard, or his tears might have led him to attempt to soothe a
                        distress which was inconsolable. He told her he knew that the tale of his
                        father's shipwreck was false, since he had been sent on in advance from
                        London to test Mrs. Van Kieft's heart but he had not wished to alarm her by
                        the information that her old lover was so near her, even dying, as it were,
                        at her door.</p>
                     <p>If her grief had been less intense, Mrs. Van Kieft must have noted what lame
                        stories the young man had told. As it was, spite of Viandra's keenness, this
                        misadventure was not injurious to his plans.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, he made a new bond of the fatality, telling his mother that, like
                        her, circumstances prevented him wearing public mourning for the dead.</p>
                     <p>So all was well, when Girard returned to town after Morgan's funeral.</p>
                     <p>Though very rich now, he apparently changed his mode of life in no wise. He
                        remained in the Merchants' Hotel as before. He kept his colonel title out of
                        sight, for, indeed, the rising generation laughed at 1812, and '45 was a
                        standing-jest. And Girard wanted to be looked at, pointed at, talked of. He
                        had suffered so much, had blushed so often, that he burnt for revenge. After
                        a shameless youth, he sighed for a respected old age.</p>
                     <p>His past little disquieted him, for he knew how, when a man steps up out of
                        the cellar by golden stairs, the first floor tenants will not remember his
                        kitchen behavior.</p>
                     <p>He cared little about Clanmoran. As he had need of his skill, he would use
                        him, but he meant to get rid of him at the heaviest cost, if he would not
                        "go off cheap."</p>
                     <p>When the two confederates met, the younger was desirous of retiring from
                        business, reasoning that they were in luck and had nothing to do but enjoy
                        themselves.</p>
                     <p>"I am rich, O yes," replied Haviland; "but I love Miss Oestervelt, and
                        marrying her, I will stand high as nephew to a noted capitalist. I,
                           <emph>now,</emph> have to raise a company to work the Shiner's Bay
                        Foundry, so as to have men of position to confer with daily.
                           <emph>Then</emph> such would flock to me of themselves."</p>
                     <p>"Your suit to Miss Oestervelt, uncle, is very risky——"</p>
                     <p>"I like to run the risk! I'm going to share with you, but not all the day
                        after my wedding. Miss Oestervelt's portion will be your reward."</p>
                     <p>Burnett held his tongue, for the other had the purse and was master of the
                        situation.</p>
                     <p>"You are quite sure this sudden resurrection and real death has not made me
                        and you suspicious in Mrs. Van Kieft's eyes?" queried Haviland.</p>
                     <p>"It shook her best opinions of us, but I think my palayer has laid the
                        ghost."</p>
                     <p>"Let's hope so. Luckily she cannot set any one to make inquiries, because
                        the act would be calling attention to herself. Keep your seat, but come
                        nearer. I am going to tell you my plans."</p>
                     <p>"I'm all ears."</p>
                     <p>"You know I went, first of all, to the banker's lady, not saying 'Your money
                        or your life,' which is a fleabite, but 'Your money or your good name!' A
                        serpents sting. I frightened her and filled her with the deepest repulsion
                        for me."</p>
                     <p>'Repulsion is a soft name for it, uncle."</p>
                     <p>"I know that. I found you and brought you out. I don't want to flatter you,
                        but I must say you made a hit. She no sooner saw you than she liked you, and
                        as soon as you spoke you were master of her heart."</p>
                     <p>"And if you——"</p>
                     <p>"Let me go on. That's the first act. The second opens with your throwing
                        about of money. Mrs. Van Kieft still loving you for your likeness to Morgan,
                        was frightened by you to such a degree that she came to ask <emph>my</emph>
                        help."</p>
                     <p>"Poor lady!"</p>
                     <p>"I came out in a strong light. I was stern but afflicted. The father
                        relented, but the governor stood firm, eh? I hauled you over the coals for
                        your shameful carrying on. Mrs. Van Kieft laid aside her bad opinion of
                        me——"</p>
                     <p>"That's a good while ago, uncle!"</p>
                     <p>The Colonel overlooked the ironical remark.</p>
                     <p>"The third act," said he, "shows Miss Oestervelt almost displaying us
                        to-night to her aunt. She feared and despised us. She would have hated you,
                        only that a mother's heart has treasures of indulgence. A mother is the only
                        woman that can love and scorn a son at the same time."</p>
                     <p>"She talked to me so that I was weak in the joints, I <emph>was!</emph>"</p>
                     <p>"So was I, my boy. Tableau to act three: Mrs. Van Kieft trembling; Viandra
                        dismissing Roadside and about to marry me, when Morgan appears to us!
                        Curtain and lapse of time. During the interval, you have become white as
                        Catskill snow, and I. black as ink. I m the old gray-headed wretch who takes
                        the lamb (<hi rend="i"/>Lamb, Mr. B. Clanmoran of the principal London
                        theatres) to slaughter! Ring up for the fourth act!"</p>
                     <p>Clanmo an drew himself up in his seat, like an old play-goer, who had
                        brought his night-cap and meant to see the piece out and nodded.</p>
                     <p>"Change of scene. You'll keep Mrs. Van Kieft in the idea that Morgan sent
                        you on ahead of him, and that he had no money to give you when you appealed
                        to her. But hint that you gambled on the passage, or when you arrived. Let
                        her suppose that that is how the son of a millionaire had to borrow of his
                        mother. She won't believe half what you say; but no matter. If she's puzzled
                        it will assist my play. Second scene—I will call upon her, and deliver the
                        following: 'When I was poor, madam, you I forced to help my brother's
                        son—your child—to live. This boy is a young scamp——"</p>
                     <p>"Thank you, old fellow!"</p>
                     <p>"He fills you with a hundred cares and embitters your life; excuse me, and
                        believe I regret it. Now I'm quite rich, and beg to say that I alone will
                        take care of the wild young dog!"</p>
                     <p>"Hullo! is that your plan?"</p>
                     <p>"Of course. Upon which, Mrs. Van Kieft will almost throw her arms round my
                        neck. She won't quite do it, because she'll remember about her niece. But
                        she'll say, as I have come into my property, of course I don't want Miss
                        Oestervelt. I beg your pardon, say I, roundly: that's how I'll prove, I am
                        not covetous, as you thought. The young lady has won upon me by her own
                        graces. If she were penniless, I should make a lady of her. It being agreed
                        that she shall be my wife, I'll insist upon it, as the price for my silence.
                        But to prove that I am not fortune hunter, I promise that on the day after
                        my marriage, I will give Burnett a check for what will make twenty thousand
                        a year!"</p>
                     <p>"Splendid!" said Clanmoran, clasping his hands; "that last will sunder Mrs.
                        Van Kieft from her niece, and rank my mother on my side."</p>
                     <p>"I hope so," said the Colonel, pretending to be modest; "and the beauty of
                        it is that it gives me excuses for my conduct. When a fellow wants to induce
                        another fellow to wink at his deal-from-under, he must quote the good Book
                        to lull their consciences to spoiling the Philistines. That is Mr. Satan's
                        standing rule. Now, I'm going to make a grand third scene, with a
                        transparency to open and discover Mr. Roadside loaded with debts, eating his
                        sardines out of faro-boxes, picking his teeth with the rouletre-pointer,
                        supping with a lost angel, as <emph>Cant</emph>-with-a-C.'s philosophy
                        says."</p>
                     <p>"Doosid pretty! I wouldn't mind letting her have half my state-room when I
                        go back home."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, she is pretty; the picture of a girl I used to know ever so long back.
                        But I was saying I make Mrs. Van Kieft understand that an elderly, steady
                        man with a mint is better for her niece than a gay boy who empties his
                        pocketbook like peeling a tree of leaves."</p>
                     <p>"She'll see it."</p>
                     <p>"But hold on. Your mother will repeat my story to you, and by that we'll see
                        how she took it. But you get your back up against the idea of accepting
                        anything from me! You'll go to bed without your supper, you'll sleep on the
                        fish-stalls of the markets, you'll go around selling penny songs, before you
                        take a red from that humbug, the Santa Anna colonel. You hate me too much;
                        you are down on me; you'll shoot me——There! you can see the scene from
                        here."</p>
                     <p>"Very plain, and I'm very telling in the waterworks situations when I have
                        time to study."</p>
                     <p>"You'll have plenty. But your generous loftiness does not prevent your going
                        on benders. You emigrate from bank to bank, and you bleed at every vein from
                        tiger-scratches. You whine, you roar, you help, you snarl, you bowl for
                        money! And <abbr>N. B.:</abbr> I shan't ask for any account of whatever you
                        can extract; it'll be all yours——"</p>
                     <p>"The deuce, you say! I'll go ahead, and at express speed."</p>
                     <p>"Before three months you must have stripped the two ladies of everything,
                        down to Mrs. Van Kieft's wedding-ring and keeper. When they believe they are
                        beyond redemption, I will step in. <foreign xml:lang="ITA">Finale!</foreign>
                        my speech of noble grandeur that will bring tears to Viandra's eyes. She
                        will hate me, but she won't look down on me when she finds that I never went
                        after her money. There never was a woman who was not vulnerable to a strong
                        passion: it excuses everything. I don't dream that she'll love me—for, my
                        boy, I've seen too<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC8328-00000039"/> much not to
                        believe in love—but she will come to me not <emph>too</emph>
                        repugnantly."</p>
                     <p>Clanmoran was silenced by such reasoning. The apprentice admired his
                        master's immense superiority in evil.</p>
                     <p>"You would certainly succeed uncle," said he, at last, "if that cashier was
                        out of the case. But his memory will always stand between you and
                        Viandra."</p>
                     <p>"A spectral illusion! Fig for him! The more she loves him the worse it shall
                        be for him. He to try be a 'sport!' I wonder who he stole so much 'cheek'
                        from? I'm already cutting down the tree that will be the snag for him. The
                        money my brother deposited with Van Kieft is payable at a week's demand now,
                        since 'tis mine. You'll learn why, yet. You never were of the Sunday-school
                        sort, I guess, if you don't know where the wrong road leads to? Roadside
                        spends more than he makes; he has a girl that sets more eagles flying than
                        there are coined a year; he has two houses, keeps a turn out, has lots of
                        friends, tries to figure out the percentage for the player at faro! You know
                        what cards are?"</p>
                     <p>Clanmoran winked, and executed a pass with his hand as quick as
                        lightning.</p>
                     <p>"He'll want money some morning after a night's crosses; his pockets will be
                        empty, but the banker's safe will be full——"</p>
                     <p>"Eh?"</p>
                     <p>"You mean he's honest; So was I, the eve of the day when I turned from
                        'outsider' into a 'patent!' I know the fool's honest, for a hound would have
                        treated Miss Oestervelt to a railroad trip out West long ago, and scooped us
                        deep. You saw he is beloved? If so, what milk runs in his veins that he lets
                        his girl give him the 'not-at-home?' If I had had a kiss of her's it would
                        take the best pair of men 'twixt the Kennebec and the Colorado to tear her
                        away. I mean to pile-drive that man so deep down into the mud that the
                        woman's thought 'll never reach to him."</p>
                     <p>"By my help?" said Chanmoran; "you give me nice jobs, I swear."</p>
                     <p>"Touchy? It's too late for you to take your hand back. Oh, oh! Mr. Clanmoran
                        wants opera-boxes in London, wants to cut down Hastings' horses with a Derby
                        winner of his own, wants to have Brunswick's diamonds and Hamilton's
                        favorite girl, wants a thirty guinea a head dinner to his selections at the
                        Clarendon, wants to be in the clubs where he can light his clear by the
                        Prince of Wales'—but he wants to be virtuous! Not so fast! Were the miners
                        of <emph>wet</emph> diggins,' my boy! We get bemired when we sieve out our
                        gold! but we can wash the stains off after the spangles shine up!"</p>
                     <p>"Well, uncle I never was rich enough to be honest," said Clanmoran humbly,
                        "but I'm too English, if I <emph>am</emph> a bad 'un! Tripping up my friend
                        is unmanly enough, but torturing two defenseless women, one of them young
                           <emph>and</emph> pretty—oh! you are letting out the whip too, too
                        cutting!"</p>
                     <p>"Defenceless women! By jingo, that's out of some play! I down right pity
                        you! An ass refuses to drink because a couple of lilies have fallen into the
                        bucket! Your system leads to Blackwell's Island or six months sentence—they
                        keep the lion <emph>for life,</emph> but they kick the skunk and his cage
                        out of doors before he has been an hour's curiosity!"</p>
                     <p>"Hang it!" said the young man, getting no and taking a turn in the room. I
                        only offered my objections, just to show you that I have my work cut out for
                        me, and that twenty thousand a year is not too much pay—"</p>
                     <p>"And all you can squeeze out between this and my wedding-day?"</p>
                     <p>"Done! but I want guarantees. What'll see me paid in full? My little
                        'teaser,' here shown? No, thank you, old fellow, your skin with a knife hole
                        in it wouldn't be worth an honest man's."</p>
                     <p>After a long debate, all was settled to their mutual satisfaction, and the
                        pair parted with a hearty shake of the hand.</p>

                     <p>Things took the course that Girard laid down.</p>
                     <p>Once again, just as Mrs. Van Kieft was breathing easier, Burnett plunged
                        into extravagances. It was town talk where he threw away the metal. He had
                        laid aside shame even in the parlor, and demanded like a master. If there
                        was delay shown, he behaved like Manfred of the gutter.</p>
                     <p>In one month, he had "cleared out" the two ladies. They had to have recourse
                        to all the blushing expediences of women robbing their own households. They
                        put off shopkeepers and bought on credit. They made up their old dresses,
                        and pretended to be very ravenous for fashionable novelties, till Van Kieft
                        used to crack jokes on their coquetry.</p>
                     <p>They bewailed their station in life, which obliged them to dress up to a
                        certain mark. Their jewels went to pawnbrokers and diamond dealers, per
                        Clanmoran.</p>
                     <p>A few, well known among their friends, they had to beg to be let keep.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Van Kieft one day saw Colonel Haviland. She had no sooner began to
                        complain of his nephew, than he broke out in great surprise:</p>
                     <p>"Well, upon my word, I never heard of such a scape-grace! Has he really been
                        drawing money from you? Bless me! During this last quarter, he's had over
                        five thousand dollars from me; I can show you his receipts."</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Van Kieft was amazed, and, after Girard had implored her to ask him for
                        any amount, she returned to her niece to report that they must have been
                        mistaken to think ill of the Colonel.</p>
                     <p>Miss Oestervelt was not so gullible. There were reasons for her distrust, as
                        the usual conferences of Burnett and Havrand showed.</p>
                     <p>That same day the latter went over to Astoria to see his accomplice.</p>
                     <p>"Nothing could be better," said he, "your receipts came at her 'end on!' But
                        you <emph>have</emph> been chuteing the rocks! Eight thousand from the
                        lady!"</p>
                     <p>"Yes. It'd been ten if the diamond dealers weren't such pork-shunning
                        thieves. A fence who would deal on the square would be the man surest to get
                        a heap of custom ever known!"</p>
                     <p>"You must be saving up, my boy! The girl with the creamy complexion at
                        Irene's don't cost you anything like that!"</p>
                     <p>"Never you mind my biz! I have pressed the pair of pippins till there's only
                        one turn of the screw needed now to finish them."</p>
                     <p>"Right. The train is laid. I've only to knock the ash off my Habana and fire
                        it. How are you getting on with Roadside?"</p>
                     <p>"He's in Queer street, but his face is turned too often toward the way out!
                        He's a riddle. He's dunned right and left, harrassed by chaps he's borrowed
                        money of, but he don't show it. He plays an uncommon tidy hand, and seems to
                        care less when he loses than when he wins."</p>
                     <p>"But his girl?"</p>
                     <p>"He's all on Gipsy, and he's a poor bit, after all. She's satisfied, now
                        that's she's got a piano that she can't play, and has oysters in wine
                        sauces. If I had only time to get some of the London 'devourers' over here,
                        the ignorant, B and bull's-foot dunces that make a man 'go up' higher 'n a
                        balloon in a six-month! I've seen him into every lively crib in town."</p>
                     <p>"And he keeps cool? How I hate him!" said Girard.</p>
                     <p>It was because the idea stung him that, though he might make Viandra his, it
                        would be by force, and her spirit would be always on the wing to
                        another.</p>
                     <p>"Burnett," resumed the Colonel, "I understand that Mr. Van Kieft has been
                        asking you to be clerk in his bank?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes; corresponding clerk. I refused flatly."</p>
                     <p>"Yes; it would never do to have you there when——never mind. Of course you
                        have gone through the building?"</p>
                     <p>"As if I was going to get up a 'crack.'"</p>
                     <p>"I've a man in my foundery tending a core stove who worked at the
                        manufactory, and he talks big of the steel safe that Van Kieft bought."</p>
                     <p>"It's an extra bit of work," said Clanmoran thoughtfully. "He insisted 'all
                        out' to show me the impregnability of it."</p>
                     <p>"Who? the banker? The devil, he was such a fool!"</p>
                     <p>"Eh? Do I look like a burglar?"</p>
                     <p>"I hope you had a <emph>burglar's</emph> LOOK! Tell us, being steel, isn't
                        it vulnerable by acid?"</p>
                     <p>"No. Composition in the metal to prevent rust, and, I suppose, that means
                        any oxydizing, if that's the word."</p>
                     <p>"Oxydation's better. Would a key be hard to make?"</p>
                     <p>"That's the devil of it! It locks with combination spelling, letters on five
                        buttons."</p>
                     <p>"But one might try a key?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh, no! The stem of the key is apart from the wards; when you turn the bit
                        there's something in the lock carries the curses thing away from the handle,
                        and if it's a false key it won't return it, but they'll find the piece of
                        metal when they open it properly. They'd know a fellow had been tampering,
                        and so you must have the real key or a twin."</p>
                     <p>"Thunder! How about forcing the door off, or out?"</p>
                     <p>"The edges are curved——"</p>
                     <p>"And a wedge won't follow a curve——"</p>
                     <p>"Eureka! I mean Euclid; same old Greek, uncle, eh?"</p>
                     <p>"I'm in earnest! So a beveled end or claw crowbar won't work? Are the hinges
                        the least exposed?"</p>
                     <p>"No; they're hung on hardened 'center's——"</p>
                     <p>"But at the door corners——"</p>
                     <p>"The frame is bent and case-hardened, and there's no bite for a purchase—I
                        tried 'on the quiet' with my lead pencil."</p>
                     <p>"I suppose the key hole-flap can be wrenched off——"</p>
                     <p>"Oh, yes. That's an excrescence."</p>
                     <p>"Then nitro-glycerine! Blow the whole affair up!"</p>
                     <p>"Oh, uncle, how coarse you are! But that wouldn't do. The maker fancied some
                        thick-fingered beggar would clap a squib in the keyhole, and so there's a
                        valve to the socket of the lock, with parallel fenders to yield slowly
                        against a shock. The socket is 'blind,' too, and not a grain of powder would
                        touch the levers. No, sir, this safe is no coon to whimper: 'Don't shoot,
                        Colonel; I'm coming down!'"</p>
                     <p>"Then we must know the word, and have the key!"</p>
                     <p>"To get either one will be hard enough," said Clanmoran, meaning it.</p>
                     <p>"Granted; but to the man who lives at the delta, the trees that grow on the
                        river bank, ever so far up, will come <emph>some</emph> day! Keep your eyes
                        open——"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, and hands open to grab! Good-by, old fellow!"</p>
                     <p>"And good luck, my boy!"</p>
                     <p>It happened that Mr. Van Kieft had taken Chanm ran's refusal of a clerkship
                        under him, in ill part. He had thus sought to put an end to wild behavior
                        that promised to reflect on him perhaps. Clanmoran "took snuff" himself at
                        the banker's coldness, and ceased to look in upon his mother except when he
                        knew the master of the house was down town. He only same then, just often
                        enough to keep himself posted on what was going on there.</p>
                     <p>Such a calm after the many hard blows, seemed ominous to Miss Oestervelt of
                        some last and terrible outbreak.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, Girard and his ally were waiting for events to drag the victim into
                        the ambush.</p>
                     <p>Arm in arm with Roadside, Clanmoran did his best to get him into some scrape
                        whence he could only scramble by leaving his good name behind. But the
                        cashier's mood offered no opening. Haviland grew uneasy, and was thinking of
                        some plan more expeditions, when, one night at eleven, Burnett came to his
                        hotel for him.</p>
                     <p>"What's wrong?" he challenged.</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps it's no go, but perhaps it's a great go! I've just left Prosper in
                        Sallie Arnold's—he thinks I'm in the next room to his now. He's drunk as an
                        owl, but I couldn't get him into playing deep!"</p>
                     <p>"You're drunk yourself," said Haviland, annoyed, "to come bother me with
                        such a string."</p>
                     <p>"I know my eyes are blinking, but never you mind; Prosper was gabbling some
                        things he keeps close, and he let out the key-word for the Steel Safe."</p>
                     <p>"Eh?"</p>
                     <p>"It's Gipsy!"</p>
                     <p>"His girl's name!"</p>
                     <p>"Yes; but it's the word! five letters—five knobs!"</p>
                     <p>"Put your head under a water-faucet while I dress!" cried the Colonel,
                        jumping out of bed, for he had kept good hours since he had become rich.
                        "We've got him, we've got him tight! So our honest young cashier won't dip
                        into the till; but we'll make it a matter of no difference whether he did or
                        no! We have the word! You know the key——"</p>
                     <p>"When Van Kieft goes home he locks it up in a drawer in his room——"</p>
                     <p>"You are sobered, I see! We have only now to select the day for our
                        operation."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, yes, but—but the word may be changed——"</p>
                     <p>"Pooh! not in a month. They get careless about such things."</p>
                     <p>"There will only be a small amount of the 'ready' in——"</p>
                     <p>"No! for I'll give Van Kieft a week's notice to hand back my deposit—upwards
                        of sixty thousand now——"</p>
                     <p>"That's an idea!"</p>
                     <p>"It will be in the safe over night."</p>
                     <p>"Grand!"</p>
                     <p>"I have the loft over the express company's to store some models in—it's ten
                        houses from the bank, but the roofs are all flat; the scuttle to the bank is
                        easily unhasped."</p>
                     <p>"I know! Bear weight on the scuttle-and the hook swings out of the
                        loop!"</p>
                     <p>"Yes! Now go back to the fool who thinks he sleeps with voluptuousness; but
                        it's infamy who beds with him now!"</p>
                     <p>"Sharp's the word! If Gipsy is the pass, he is lost!"</p>
                     <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
                     <p>Eight or ten days after this the robbery was perpetrated, to which Prosper
                        Roadside fell a victim, and under it he still labored, spite of the

                     <head type="sub">WHILE PROSPER WAS IN JAIL—VIANDRA BELIEVES, MRS. VAN KIEFT
                        GUESSES—THE FINISHING TOUCHES—DREAD IS THE SHAFT HORSE IN THE TANDEM WITH
                        CRIME.</head>
                     <p>"Viandra is mine!"</p>
                     <p>So said Colonel Haviland when he found that Prosper Roadside had been
                        arrested for the Great Bank Robbery and lodged in jail.</p>
                     <p>At the same time Mrs. Van Kieft was in a fever; the news had excited her
                        mind to such a degree that the slightest incidents, such as before had
                        passed her unperceived, arose most palpably.</p>
                     <p>She feared that she had been the mere dupe in some shameful play, and that
                        Clanmoran had tortured her coldly, by premeditation, winning on her
                        sufferings and speculating on her affection.</p>
                     <p>And yet, remembering that however evident was the hand of her son in the
                        crime, Roadside's complicity was almost necessary, she faltered in her
                        suspicious.</p>
                     <p>It was much to her whether Prosper had been hand-in-hand with Burnett or
                        not.</p>
                     <p>She had a high opinion of the cashier, and yet she understood that he had
                        placed a large sum of money in the steel safe, contrary to her husband's
                        order.</p>
                     <p>And the key-word!</p>
                     <p>She did not know it—or Burnett might have stolen it from her. When he had
                        come to see her with some touching story late on the eve of the robbery, and
                        again early in the morning, she had believed it was for what he had said: to
                        detail his misadventure at a gambling-table. But, when her niece returned
                        with the news, she had intuitively guessed that Burnett had come for the
                        key, the key that her husband kept at home when he was there. The young man
                        had even urged her to go out and leave him, while she got the few dollars he
                        clamored for.</p>
                     <p>The more she repelled the idea, the closer it clung to her.</p>
                     <p>It ended by her self-acknowledgment that Burnett was guilty of the
                        robbery.</p>
                     <p>But, always blind, she sought to saddle the crime on anybody but her
                        son.</p>
                     <p>Roadside, it was said, kept one of those creatures whose breath melts away
                        coin like fire, and bills like consumable cartridge-paper. Such a young man
                        was capable of anything.</p>
                     <p>Still, she excused the guilty cashier, for <emph>she</emph> knew to what one
                        misstep might lead!</p>
                     <p>She confessed to herself that she was to blame for it all. Who else had
                        forbidden the young man to enter her house? who had thrown down his castle
                        of cards, destroyed his chaste love, and driven him out upon the street to
                        lift a wicked girl out of a cellar or from the doorway of a dance-house?</p>
                     <p>Fatally inspired, she intended to keep her belief in Burnett's guilt to
                        herself.</p>
                     <p>But Viandra had returned from her interview with the cashier in no mood for
                        delicacy.</p>
                     <p>When she was alone with her aunt she was paler than the dead; her eyes wore
                        a feverish glare, her whole body trembled like one great aspen real.</p>
                     <p>"Aunt, aunt!" she cried in a shrill voice; "Prosper is in jail! Oh! but he
                        is innocent, for I have seen him and spoken with him, and he never could
                        have looked me in the face if he had dreamt of such a misdeed! The Colonel
                        or Mr. Clanmoran has done this!"</p>
                     <p>"Oh! why? What do you mean?"</p>
                     <p>"The monsters!" continued Viandra, "what can they desire by this? Defaming
                        Prosper is worse than killing him! And yet, if he had been murdered, I
                        should die soon after him!"</p>
                     <p>The early return of the banker, perhaps, prevented his wife from telling her
                        niece the grounds for her own suspicion. Van Kieft was in such a rage that
                        he could hardly speak.</p>
                     <p>"The scoundrel!" he stammered. "He had the impudence to accuse me! He has
                        done the best he could to make Wall street see my work in it all! The
                        detectives have been watching me just as if I had slunk down town in the
                        night to rob myself! That confounded Jersey Colonel actually looked
                        disappointed when he was paid! It's my own fault too—I might have foreseen
                        what the young dog was coming to with his fast manners!"</p>
                     <p>Verily, on that day Viandra's devotion to her aunt was put to a fiery
                        ordeal, for the generous girl saw her lover dragged into jail, though she
                        believed him as stainless as herself. She fancied she could point out the
                        real authors of the plot to which he had fallen a victim, and yet she must
                        not lift a finger toward them.</p>
                     <p>The house became dreary, and the servants went about on tiptoe, as though
                        there was crape on the knob and a coffin in the parlor.</p>
                     <p>While Roadside was languishing in prison, Mr. Van Kieft was in a detestable
                        humor, except one day. He had come home quite pleasant then, for an
                        unexpected event had transpired.</p>
                     <p>Colonel Haviland, whom he had declared his hatred for, came to him one day
                        and, before his clerks, apologized for his roughness of the week before.</p>
                     <p>He said he had been struggling with himself ever since the robbery; for
                        after all, he had in some part been concerned, as his want for money had led
                        to its being placed in the clerk's hands, a temptation.</p>
                     <p>His tone of studied deference was such a contrast to his usual haughty
                        accents that the banker was quite disarmed.</p>
                     <p>Haviland blamed his bad temper, which, he asserted, made him as violent when
                        he was vexed as if he was but twenty, instead of a gray-headed man.</p>
                     <p>As Van Kieft was hasty, while yet a good-hearted man, he was more apt than
                        anybody else to appreciate the Colonel's retraction, and be affected by it.
                        Besides, his long life of probity was not to be harmed by a paltry trick of
                        an ungovernable temper.</p>
                     <p>He gave Haviland his hand on it; Girard explained why he had wanted money in
                        such a hurry, and, as they parted, Van Kieft insisted that he should come up
                        and see them at home.</p>
                     <p>In the evening, therefore, the Colonel called. The banker was not in, and
                        the two ladies were alone.</p>
                     <p>The Colonel went in, grave and sorrowful, refused the eat offered him, and
                        excused himself for intruding under plea of a duty he had to fulfill.</p>
                     <p>"I know all!" he said, in a whisper.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Van Kieft laid her finger on her lips, for she saw he was going to
                        reveal what she kept secret from her niece. The Colonel did not seem to see
                        it, he was so intently eyeing Viandra.</p>
                     <p>"I learn from Burnett Clanmoran that he came here the night of the robbery,
                        to get the key to the safe——"</p>
                     <p>Anger and shame empurpled Viandra's cheeks, and seizing her aunt by the
                        hand, she asked her in a hoarse voice:</p>
                     <p>"Is that true?"</p>
                     <p>"Alas! I feared as much," moaned Mrs. Van Kieft.</p>
                     <p>Viandra rose, confounded by such despicable weakness.</p>
                     <p>"And so you have let Prosper be accused," she cried. "You let him remain in
                        prison!"</p>
                     <p>"But, but, Viandra, he was with Burnett——"</p>
                     <p>"For shame!" exclaimed the young lady, "could you believe that, whoever told
                        you?"</p>
                     <p>"Unhappily," interposed Haviland, in a distressed tone, "your aunt does not
                        slander Mr. Roadside. Burnett confesses."</p>
                     <p>"Burnett is a villain——"</p>
                     <p>"It seems so; but who betrayed the word to the safe, the key being
                        useless——"</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Roadside has one——"</p>
                     <p>"That's the very reason he dared not use <emph>his!</emph>"</p>
                     <p>But Viandra was in no wise affected by this argument.</p>
                     <p>"Well, what's become of the money?" inquired she, taking no pains to hide
                        scorn, almost equal to disgust.</p>
                     <p>There was no mistaking the bearing of the question. Her piercing look made
                        it signify: "you planned the theft, and were the receiver."</p>
                     <p>This scorching insult from the person whom the so prudent man loved to the
                        degree of risking the results of his crimes, burnt him like vitriol. But his
                        plot was too profoundly studied for him to be put out.</p>
                     <p>"Miss Oestervelt," said he, "a day will come when you will be sorry for
                        treating me so. I guess what you mean, and you need not attempt to deny
                        it——"</p>
                     <p>"I do not deny anything, sir!"</p>
                     <p>"Viandra!" murmured Mrs. Van Kieft, trembling to see the evil passions
                        fanned of a man who held her fate in his grasp; "for mercy's sake, my
                        dear——"</p>
                     <p>"Mercy is the word to use, madame," said Colonel Haviland. "Miss Oestervelt
                        is too hard upon one whose only fault is having obeyed the last wishes of
                        his brother. I came here only to prove that I shrink from no sacrifices that
                        Morgan's son may render inevitable." He drew from his breast coat pocket
                        several packets of bank bills and laid them on the center-table.</p>
                     <p>"I understand that full seventy thousand dollars was taken by the pair of
                        robbers. That sum is here, a large proportion of my property; but I hope now
                        that this crime is too great a one not to be my nephew's last."</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Van Kieft rejoiced at such a restitution; but Viandra, though too
                        inexperienced to understand Girard's simple but audacious plan, was only
                        puzzled for the moment.</p>
                     <p>"Thank you, you are very good," said Mrs. Van Kieft, taking the Colonel's
                        hand.</p>
                     <p>But while he smiled, triumphant too soon, reflection had restored to the
                        young lady her former distrust. She found such disinterestedness much too
                        theatrically fine to be real in a man whom she esteemed as incapable of a
                        generous thought, and she judged that it was a new lure.</p>
                     <p>"What are we to do with that money?" she inquired.</p>
                     <p>"Give it to Mr. Van Kieft."</p>
                     <p>"How can we? To do so would be denouncing Burnett—ruining my aunt. Take back
                        your money, sir."</p>
                     <p>"I understand your refusal," said Haviland, too cunning to resist. "I must
                        find out a way myself, I see! But I cannot go, Miss Oestervelt, without
                        telling you how much your injustice pains me. After the pledge you were so
                        good as to give me, I might well have expected a better welcome."</p>
                     <p>"I will keep my promise, sir, but not before you shall have given me
                        guarantees. After my marriage, what will prevent Mr. Clanmoran persecuting
                        his mother again? What will the little money I have be to a man who has
                        squandered more than twenty thousand dollars in four months? We have made a
                        bargain, and I mean to give you my hand in return for my aunt's peace of
                        mind; but I want guarantees for it, first of all."</p>
                     <p>"I'll give you such as will manifest my good faith," replied Girard. "How
                        shall I prove my devotion? By trying to save Mr. Roadside?"</p>
                     <p>"Thank you, sir" returned Viandra, contemptuously. "If Prosper is guilty,
                        let him perish! If innocent, a stronger Hand than yours will shield
                        him!"</p>
                     <p>The Colonel bowed himself out, never more vexed.</p>
                     <p>"What a proud bit she is!" he muttered. "Asks guarantees from me! By
                        heavens, if I didn't love her so much, I'd throw down my 'deck!' But I do
                        love her, she's so handsome! and she'll see the Springs and the Falls with
                        me beside her vet!"</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile he was too experienced to flatter himself that he could intimidate
                        such a spirit as the new oppositionist's that so abruptly arose.</p>
                     <p>He found that he had to begin a new game.</p>
                     <p>His adversary was dally—nav, hourly—beside Mrs. Van Kieft, over whom she was
                        likely to domineer by her strength and boldness.</p>
                     <p>Viandra would sell herself at the price, but only when sure the price would
                        be given.</p>
                     <p>And how could he remove her doubts?</p>
                     <p>Certainly, as soon as Haviland should marry, and pay off Burnett Mrs. Van
                        Kieft would not be troubled again; but how could that be made clear to the
                        young lady?</p>
                     <p>Exact information on all the points of the guilty combination would have set
                        her at ease; but, before marriage at the least, a hint could not be
                        given.</p>
                     <p>The more certain the Colonel was of Viandra's hate and corn, the deeper his
                        desire to have her; and, but for a gleam of reason calming his stormy brain,
                        he would have tried to see her once again.</p>
                     <p>Then there was Burnett to be thrust aside. Girard had let him have the
                        amount the two of them had stolen; a further sum was to be given him when
                        his marriage should have been consummated; but the young man incumbered
                        him.</p>
                     <p>He was not a man to be troubled by stumbling-blocks; he rolled them out of
                        the way at once. Yet to remove Burnett, so sharp and distrustful, was no
                        easy matter.</p>
                     <p>For the present, however, the two men were joined by the imminence of
                        danger, and they meant to go in company to Mathers' masquerade ball.</p>
                     <p>Thither, also, the Van Kiefts were going.</p>
                     <p>They were obliged to appear, as the Mathers were their intimate friends.</p>
                     <p>The ladies were in agony, for their dressmaker had not been paid for
                        months.</p>
                     <p>A new servant, who came as maid to Miss Oestervelt, giving her name as Jane
                        Raymond, lifted them out of their embarrassment. This girl, who seemed to
                        know a great deal about the vexations of "hard times," seemed to guess what
                        troubled her mistresses, for, without being asked, she recommended a French
                        dressmaker, who was beginning business and would be glad to credit, as long
                        as a lady of Mrs. Van Kieft's position would let it be known where she had
                        her materials made up.</p>
                     <p>But that was not all.</p>
                     <p>Neither of the ladies could go to the ball without jewels.</p>
                     <p>All their sets had gone to the pawnbrokers', by Burnett's help, and he kept
                        the tickets. It was then that Viandra again showed the independence of her
                        character.</p>
                     <p>It was she that had borrowed money of her uncle, to transmit it to Roadside,
                        before she knew that he would be released. She had carried her feminine
                        precaution so far as to manufacture the letter accompanying the money out of
                        an out-of-the-way paper, which, indeed, would not have served any one but so
                        keen a man as Mr. Sharpson.</p>
                     <p>And now, the idea no sooner struck her that she might extract from Burnett
                        some of the jewels he had forced from his weak mother, than she told the
                        latter to make an appointment with the young man.</p>
                     <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC8328-00000041"/>
                     <p>On the day after, the brave girl, spite of the adverse weather, had gone to
                        beard the young tiger in his lair, never dreaming that Roadside and his new
                        friend were witnesses of her bold step.</p>
                     <p>She had not gained much by it, for Burnett declared that he had divided the
                        spoil with Prosper, and that he was penniless himself, as he had spent every
                        cent of his share. He also clung to the pawn-tickets, but as the young lady
                        energetically persisted, she wrung from him a few duplicates of
                        indispensable articles.</p>
                     <p>This refusal had been prescribed by Haviland, who hoped that the ladies
                        would apply to him, and Burnett handsomely yielded to the order after a
                        wrangle, of which Joseph (the Colonel's new servant had been a witness.</p>

                        laughter, music and pleasure, and there are throngs everywhere!</p>
                     <p>On one of its finest avenues rose the mansion of Mr. Lawrence Mathers.</p>
                     <p>Before it had been quite finished, the pressgang had been let "go through"
                        it thoroughly, and scarcely and editor was there, who had not gone into
                        ecstasies over its gorging with beauties.</p>
                     <p>Marble, gold, paint, wrestled with one another as to which was to meet the
                        ravished eve whichever way it turned.</p>
                     <p>On the night in question, a crowd only to be paralleled by such as collects
                        on a prince's arrival in Gotham, packed the street each side of the house.
                        These were people who meant to see the dresses of the happy beings who held
                        invitations, and get peeps through the broad doorway into the hall, and
                        through the curtains of the wide casements. At ten o'clock the dancing had
                        already began in the spacious drawing-rooms, to the music of Manahan's and
                        other bands.</p>
                     <p>It was a fancy dress ball. Almost all the costumes drew "Ahs!" and "Ohs!"
                        from the outside gazers, they were so costly, some so tasty, some so very
                        original.</p>
                     <p>Among the latter a sort of Buckley, Bryant and Christy fused into one type
                        of the negro minstrel was to be remarked.</p>
                     <p>He was of a rich black-brown color, with vermillion lips, plenty of white to
                        his eyes, a short-curl wig with little tails, a flaming red vest with horned
                        buttons as big as the cover of a churn (more or less), a swallow-tail coat
                        made of a bed-spread (such as were made in Revolutionary days, of a Joseph's
                        coat variegatedness), striped breeches, banded stockings and "swamp-skiff"
                        shoes. His hat was white, with a yellow band to match his bandanna
                        handkerchief, kept within it. He carried a banjo, and he <emph>could</emph>
                        play it. On the handle was fastened a long-flag, on which was painted half a
                        dozen pictures of nondescripts in bright hues.</p>
                     <p>He had jumped out of his stylish carriage to execute "Pete Johnson's knock"
                        on the stoop top-stone, to the delight of the mob, and he had entered the
                        parlor doing the no less difficult "old Trimble toes;" but then he had kept
                        quiet, inside near the door.</p>
                     <p>Several of the guests had tried to draw him out, but, thrumming his banjo
                        carelessly, he stayed at his post until a quarter to eleven.</p>
                     <p>Mr. and Mrs. Van Kieft and their niece were entering.</p>
                     <p>Quite a press was formed around them, for the Great Robbery had been food
                        for the liveliest conversation. Friends were eager to show the banker that
                        their opinion of him had not altered, and enemies delighted to have a chance
                        of offering those amphisbœan compliments, which are the most stinging in the
                        language.</p>
                     <p>As he was a serious man, Mr. Van Kieft had dressed himself merely as one of
                        the old Knickerbockers; and it would have done Irving good to have seen his
                        sturdy figure in black velvet and red hose.</p>
                     <p>On his arm Mrs. Van Kieft was nodding to her acquaintances with graceful
                        affability. Her beauty had been notable once, and, the magic of the toilet
                        aiding, she seemed to have risen from a dip in the fountain of youth. No one
                        would have thought her nearly fifty. She wore, to agree somewhat with her
                        husband's Holland attire, the dress of Rubens' wife, as seen in that
                        portrait, with the masses of flowers round about them.</p>
                     <p>But to dear, sweet (sweet and dear because she was a brave, noble girl!)
                        Viandra rose all eyes.</p>
                     <p>There was the brightness of the waters on which is embosomed Manhattan in
                        her smile; the beauty of the reigning city of our great nation, its dashing,
                        fierce, warm, earnest, heedless life seemed in her blushes.</p>
                     <p>Never had her hair been of a deeper black; never her complexion richer;
                        never had a republican's figure borne itself more modestly grand, to prove
                        what nonsense is the fiction of queenly or aristocratic carriage being the
                        monopoly of any one family.</p>
                     <p>When she could, Viandra went one way on her aunt's arm, while Mr. Van Kieft
                        mingled with the crowd to find the graver husbands and fathers of families
                        who <emph>had</emph> to come, but did not pretend to join in the sport.</p>
                     <p>The ball was going up the hill to its splendor.</p>
                     <p>A new waltz, composed by Miss Carrie T. H——, on one of Foster's melodies,
                        was being played by the doubled band, and the silver instruments were
                        flooding the rooms with ringing sweetness.</p>
                     <p>Diamonds sparkled under the glittering gaselier drops, the palest cheeks
                        were warming up, eyes were shining like Brazilian fire-flies, and even the
                        wall-flowers seemed to bloom again.</p>
                     <p>Forgotten, the lowly darkey had sidled off into the depths of a window,
                        where, leaning on his banjo, he looked about him.</p>
                     <p>He seemed to be little affected by so much magnificence—not to be outshone
                        in Paris, or London, or Berlin, or Vienna, mind you: and naught of the
                        intoxicating air dimmed his un-winking eyes.</p>
                     <p>One couple, dancing not far from him, he watched steadily. It was Viandria
                        Oestervelt, leaning on the arm of a Mexican haciendero, twinkling with
                        silver dollars sown on his velvet dress. This was Colonel Haviland, beaming,
                        rejuvenated, and triumphant. Viandria lent ear to his chat, sometimes
                        smiling.</p>
                     <p>"I take my oat's on it," muttered the negro to himself, "dat dat venerable
                        young chile de cunnle is a payin' court to is de bankerer's niece, like a
                        cupple o' Yankees on a husky frolic! Yes, sah! Jee! but I don't see why for
                        the young misses she hsen so kind o' interested to de ole scoundrile! It's
                        jess de bes' ting a man eber know'd dat Massa Roa'side not heah, I
                        guess."</p>
                     <p>He was interrupted by a man, wearing the dress of Miles Standish (as drawn
                        by Gilbert), who came up to him.</p>
                     <p>"Mr. —— Sharpson!" said he in a merry tone, "you won't forget that you
                        promised me you don't mean to arrest anybody here——"</p>
                     <p>The darkey bobbed his head, and answered seeing an English sailor boy
                        (Burnett Clanmoran) pass, in an Irish brogue:</p>
                     <p>"Begorra—axin' yer honor's forgiveness lettin' that same bad worrud slip
                        me—I niver forgot a thing in my life, wuss luck!"</p>
                     <p>"You won't cause a disturbance, then?"</p>
                     <p>"Is it me! Thot has a name for me quiteness all through the counthry! Ownly
                        hear him!"</p>
                     <p>"Very well, then. May I advise you to ask the head waiter in the supper-room
                        for some of that New Brunswick trout—it's slightly salmony,' and too
                        uncommon for everybody to have a plate of it."</p>
                     <p>"May the hivins give yer honor as miny blissin's as they is spots on thim
                        same throut!" said the negro, laughing <unclear>slily</unclear>. "It's
                        Misther Sambo O'Shaughnessy that's yer grateful sarvint!"</p>
                     <p>During this, the quadrille had finished, and Colonel Haviland had led away
                        his partner.</p>
                     <p>"I'll find them somewhere near Mrs. Van Kieft," thought the banjoist,
                        turning away.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Van Kieft had strolled into the vast glass-roofed extension, full of
                        flowers, orange, lilac and other trees. A very fine cluster of magnolia
                        blows swam in perfumed water in a large alabaster vase in the center.</p>
                     <p>The negro serenader perceived Miss Oesterveit seated on the right hand of
                        her aunt, near the doorway, with Burnett beside her.</p>
                     <p>"The boy is very good-looking, I'll own up," muttered the darkey, as he
                        hunted about for a good standpoint.</p>
                     <p>Viandra was sad now; she had pulled a rose off a bush and was plucking the
                        petals, her eyes fixed on vacancy. Burnett was chatting with his mother,
                        most earnestly, although their features were smiling enough. In a corner,
                        while half hidden by a group of men playing at "fombola" for a charity
                        (!)—Colonel Haviland was lying perou, but watching the banker's wite.</p>
                     <p>"Divil bile him!" said the minstrel, "this is the very same as whin we was
                        out at Asthoria! I'se a candidate for Salt Riber boatin' but I'd gib my
                        banjerine for to hear what dey's sayin'!"</p>
                     <p>Unfortunately, while he was working round the groups of promenaders to get
                        nearer, a new dance tune was struck up, and a hum of interest told that Mrs
                        Hoey had entered the room. In an instant the conservatory was emptied. Those
                        who stayed behind were the "old girls," the homely women whose husbands were
                        young and gay, the ugly men whose wives were gay and young, and a dozen
                        striplings who were not at ease in their attire.</p>
                     <p>The negro thought it a fine opening for him. He ran his hand up to his
                        half-mask's fastenings to be sure talking would not make it fall, and
                        stepped forward to the center of the room, unrolling the banner on his banjo
                        handle. He made a ridiculous pretense of clearing his throat, like a man
                        going to deliver the thanks of the community to some heroic general who had
                        saved the Union on plans drawn up by some nameless lieutenant.</p>
                     <p>The estravs in the hall came toward him.</p>
                     <p>He had pulled a chair to him, on which he set one of his <emph>canoe</emph>
                        shoes, and he rolled his eyes as though they were black marbles in the white
                        ring.</p>
                     <p>"Ladies and gemblemen!" began he with incredible volubility, and changing
                        from quashes to brogue with the smoothest facility, "we resemble togeder on
                        dis allspicious occasiun for to hear do greatest moosical drama dat eber was
                        heard. This same is foe spot where I'm goin' to show yees the great

                        performances will begin in the turn of a shape's tail." With a perfection
                        humiliating to Ben Bakers's whole complete orchestra, he imitated, with
                        banjo and voice, a multitude of musical sounds, from the bagpipe to the
                        Boston organ, the reed-pipe of Florida to the rattle of the shells found by
                           Chi-<emph>caw</emph>-goans on the lake shore. "I spose dat ye want to

                     <p>"Is this colored man Mr. Wenken?" inquired a bulky Turk of a melancholy
                        Punch.</p>
                     <p>"I don't think so, sir; but he imitates the little pig under the gate in a
                        most superior manner!"</p>
                     <p>"Very superior I wonder what he carries on so for?"</p>
                     <p>The negro-Irishman wanted to rouse the attention of the banker's wife, who
                        had remained moody after Burnett had led Miss Oesterveltinto the ball-room.
                        He succeeded by his next essay.</p>
                     <p>"<emph>Dis</emph> picture shows de white fokes how dey lib in Japan. I'se an

                     <p>And he executed "under cleets" for a space of five yards round his stand,
                        and revolving rear Mrs. Van Kieft, saw that the familiar names had awakened
                        her. He litted one foot as high as his head, but brought it down so
                        delicately that an empty egg-shell would not have been crushed beneath the
                        heavy sole.</p>

                        under a parasol—dis is de parasol!—when she see, oh! sich a harnsum young

                     <p>While spouting to his audience, the minstrel perceived that Mrs. Van Kieft,
                        leaning back in her chair, was smiling softly to herself.</p>
                     <p>"Hullo!" thought the colored man; "am I off the track?"</p>
                     <p>"What's this! Something funny going on?" inquired Colonel Haviland,
                        strolling that way of the disconsolate Punch.</p>
                     <p>The serenader noticed him.</p>
                     <p>"In this sign-board, bedad!" pursued he with a brogue that could have been
                        scraped off his tongue with a knife, "yer goin' to see how the womandarin
                        makes a man of her young gossoon! She inthrojuces him to the quality! and
                        she gives him all she owns in the whole world: jewils, black diamints, sacks
                        of murphies, boxes of sowgers, pearls and the like. The young omadhaun tuk

                     <p>The negro was well satisfied now. Mrs. Van Kieft had begun to evince her
                        agitation, and now tried to rise and go away, but her powers failed her and
                        she sank back, forced to listen.</p>

                     <p>He stopped.</p>
                     <p>Half a dozen of his hearers had broken away to see to Mrs. Van Kieft, who
                        had fainted.</p>
                     <p>And somebody grabbed his arm. He turned quickly.</p>
                     <p>Burnett and Haviland faced him, each as pale and threatening as the
                        other.</p>
                     <p>"Begorra, I what do yees saze me for?" cried he, but calmly.</p>
                     <p>"I want a word with you."</p>
                     <p>"It's me that's proud to convarse with rale jontlefolks," said the
                        Hibernian-Etniopian, following the pair to the remote end of the
                        conservatory, looking out on the garden.</p>
                     <p>The party was in motion elsewhere. Mrs. Van Kieft's indisposition had been
                        set down to the heat, and when her husband had hastened to her he found her
                        chatting with her niece, quite herself again.</p>
                     <p>With less self-command than Canmoran, Haviland began to question the
                        darkey.</p>
                     <p>"In the first place, said he, unmasking, "I like to know to whom I am
                        talking."</p>
                     <p>But the colored man seemed to have made up his mind to keep up the illusion
                        of his double character, for he answered, mockingly.</p>
                     <p>"Did you neber heah ob de FINIS—it's in <emph>all</emph> de books! Dat's me!

                     <p>"How dare you shout out such an abominable pack of lies as I caught you at?"
                        said the Colonel, doubling his fist.</p>
                     <p>"Easy, sab, easy! You is tying de bale too tight—dar'll be a bust out ob de

                     <p>"Enough, enough! At least have pluck enough to stand up for your
                        words—confess you were hinting shameful things about Mrs. Van Kieft?"</p>
                     <p>The banjoist, with open mouth, stared about him as if he had just dropped
                        from the moon, though there was a sly twinkle in his eyes.</p>
                     <p>"Sowl to be saved!" cried he, in a voice as unlike his charcoaled one as
                        could be, "Is it Misther Sambo O'Shaughnesey thot's accused av spakin'

                     <p>"What! you move in our society and don't know what happened to Mr. Van
                        Kieft?"</p>
                     <p>"Kee! kee! oh! dar, dar, dar, a rememberer strikes me! He's de ole man wid

                     <p>But Burnett had nudged his friend, and the latter turned away.</p>
                     <p>"Since you explain that I have made a mistake," said he, in his loftiest
                        tone, "I overlook the matter!"</p>
                     <p>But the ministrel did not seem to want to part company. He began to "look
                        fight," and said, insolently:</p>
                     <p>"Faith, I think, its 'explain' ye said? Sure it's me father was in the 59th

                     <p>"Sir! I'll be her niece's husband in a week—there's plain English for your
                        gibberish."</p>
                     <p>The darkey started, but he recovered himself instantly, and, striking a
                        string or two of his instrument, sang: <q>

                     <p>With visible impatience, Burnett had listened to the effusion of words.</p>
                     <p>"You black Greek," said he sharply, with the disdain the English show for
                        the Irish, "I'd like you to know that out of your red mouth too long a
                        tongue hangs——"</p>
                     <p>Quick as a flash the negro turned on him and retorted:</p>
                     <p>"Mebbe, mebbe, young chap! but my <emph>arm's</emph> much longer!"</p>
                     <p>"Enough," said Haviland, stamping his foot; "what's the use of words with a
                        man who dassent show his face!"</p>
                     <p>"You're free to go ask my name of the Superintendent of Police! if you
                        dare!"</p>
                     <p>"You are a——"</p>
                     <p>But Burnett sprang between. A bar-room-like squabble in that parlor would
                        have been a serious public act.</p>
                     <p>The serenader waited smiling for the Colonel to come at him or his insult to
                        come to him, and then, meeting Haviland's eyes, he said slowly in a deep,
                        hollow, Hamlet-ghost voice:</p>
                     <p>"I am the best friend your brother Morgan had in his life. I was his adviser
                        in China—where I brought my displeasing story from—and <emph>here</emph>—I
                        heard his last words!</p>
                     <p>The Colonel receded as if he had been struck, and his hands covered his eyes
                        as though a spectre had risen from the vase of flowers before him. Dread
                        froze the very words in his throat.</p>
                     <p>Burnett dragged him away, staggering like a drunken man.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, oh, oh!" muttered the darkey, in surprise, in wonder, and in bewildered
                        satisfaction. "What the deuce does it mean? What's frightened the old scamp?
                        What spring did I touch in the rusty works? What a fool I'd be to take
                        credit to me for with and invention when I've hit on a greater thing by
                        chance than ever I could imagine. Chance! May not heaven have its tinger in
                        it?"</p>
                     <p>He was musing over foreign things from the festivity when a tap on his
                        shoulder made him look up.</p>
                     <p>"Are you satisfied yet, Mr. O'Shaughnessy?" asked Mr. Mathers, for it was he
                        again.</p>
                     <p>"Partly, and partly not. I have not completely found out what I wished, and
                        yet I have hit upon something that removes many of my doubts."</p>
                     <p>"You're grumbling, then?"</p>
                     <p>"No! not more than you did when I beat the pony express messenger in, and
                        railroaded from St. Louis to give you the earliest and complete news on the
                        California gold discovery."</p>
                     <p>"Which your presence here proves I have not forgotten."</p>
                     <p>"Of course not. No, I am not grumbling. I am, rather, glad that accident—or
                        Providence—has revealed me the existence of a secret I had not
                        suspected."</p>
                     <p>So saying, he rolled up his banner and mixed with the promenaders. In time,
                        he found Mrs. Van Kieft in the ball-room, conversing with her niece in a
                        very animated manner. Burnett and Haviland were moving about from group to
                        group, speaking to a number of people. Clanmoran knew all the young men, and
                        Haviland was making the acquaintance of the elders.</p>
                     <p>"I'd like to bet they're inquiring about me," muttered the negro. "They want
                        to know who I am. Good luck, my beauties."</p>
                     <p>But after awhile the two men seemed to give up their attempts.</p>
                     <p>"They want to get away to have a talk together," thought the serenader.
                        "They shake hands with the banker's family—they're going. My work's over for
                        to-night."</p>
                     <p>Soon after the Colonel and his young associate had left the house, the
                        colored man, with a coat he had negotiated for with one of the house
                        servants, went out of doors likewise.</p>
                     <p>There was a long string of carriages at the door, but it was clear, early
                        morning, and the flags dry under foot.</p>
                     <p>The negro minstrel lit a cigar, hoping the open air would facilitate the
                        collection of his thoughts, and walked from the avenue. He took the walk
                        next the fence through Madison square, when somebody quickened his steps
                        behind him, and before he could turn, brought his clenched hand, from which
                        depended a missile, down upon the negro's head.</p>
                     <p>The latter fell, half-dazed, across a flower-bed. Luckily there was a good
                        spice of the cat in him, and, always on the alert, he had almost foreseen
                        the assault, and had dropped under it—"fell with the blow," in other words.
                        Besides, the negro wool wig, which he wore over his natural head of hair,
                        prevented his rising with a hole, or a deep dent, in his skull.</p>
                     <p>It was more in rage than in pain that he scrambled to his feet, and dashed
                        at the assailant.</p>
                     <p>But, instantly, a second person thrust a stick between. The negro grabbed it
                        for his own arming, when it gave to his hand, and he found he had unsheathed
                        a sword-cane.</p>
                     <p>Seeing that the attack, whose sole success depended on its suddenness, had
                        failed, the two men parted and fled from the spot. The sword was dropped, no
                        doubt, from fear that its bared blade would attract attention in the
                        darkness.</p>
                     <p>The negro hurried to the bushes and picked it up from under a seat.
                        Returning, he put it into the cane which he held.</p>
                     <p>"The Colonel and Clanmoran," muttered he, in Jehiel Sharpson's voice; "I
                        must been walking in my sleep to have let 'em come up so close to me!"</p>
                     <p>The tread of a policeman was audible. The negro went on through the park,
                        and crossed over to the hotel to examine his wound.</p>
                     <p>"It feets soft in the spot where the young hound struck," muttered he,
                        running his hand in under the wig; "which ain't natural, whether my enemies
                        like it or not! It feels as if it was bleeding, too, but there's not a drop.
                        It will be a bump worth exhibiting in Fowler &amp; Wells' by the morning.
                        What the deuce was it? pistolbutt or slung-shot? the slung-shot, I
                        reckon—the young fellow didn't have the right hang of it! too much slack to
                        the cord, for the ball bounded off easy. By jingo! I must be on the track to
                        something red, for the scamps to attempt murder in the morning on the
                        streets. Eh? I don't see 'em, but I'll swear I'm followed!"</p>
                     <p>Indeed, when he crossed Fifteenth street, pausing in the shadow of the
                        church, he saw two shadows, corresponding in build with his acquaintances, a
                        block behind him.</p>
                     <p>The lamplights were paling before the gray morning light.</p>
                     <p>"They're a stubborn pair," thought the minstrel; "they don't care whether I
                        know they are after me or not. They must have been trying the dogging
                        before, and it won't be easy to throw them off. Oh for the cottonwoods and
                        the mountains of the West and a good rifle in my fist! I'm inclined to
                        believe they'd sleep with the coyotes to tuck 'em in 'fore evening. I can't
                        trick these boys as I did Jake Hall; and this dod-rotted fancy hat and dress
                        of mine will look like a page out of <emph>Mrs. Grundy</emph> when the sun's
                        up."</p>
                     <p>He crossed the Fourth avenue car track, toward the Third avenue.</p>
                     <p>"I must get rid of 'em, too," he continued. "It'd never oo for Steben to let
                        them follow us into the Old Pear Trse!" I don't estimate as they want to try
                        slaughtering again, but I'm sure they'd give a big sum to have the line
                           in<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC8328-00000043"/> the directory pointed out
                        that refers to me. If they guess that I'm Mr. Sharpson with a black face,
                        and that Jehiel S. is Charley Newlife with a Falstaff's paunch, my plans
                        will go up! They've got money for sliding off, and I'll have my punch in the
                        head and my trouble for nothing."</p>
                     <p>The idea of the Colonel and his accomplice escaping him, exasperated him so
                        much that for an instant he thought of showing his shield to the first
                        policeman and collaring the two followers.</p>
                     <p>He had enough to "hold" Burnett on, without a regular warrant. At the least,
                        it would come out where he had got hold of the name he bore.</p>
                     <p>On the other hand, though, there was nothing tangible against Haviland, the
                        principal rogue.</p>
                     <p>"No! I must give them the slip," thought Newlife, quickening his pace and
                        going straight down Broadway. "If the early risers ain't plenty enough to
                        shoulder them off, I'll come the 'simmy' over them, first class."</p>
                     <p>He proceeded till he had reached Dominick's Oyster Bay. The gas was burning
                        within, and some of the bummers, not more than half awake, were taking
                        eye-openers.</p>
                     <p>About ten minutes afterward Colonel Haviland was following a colored man, in
                        a different hat and coat, but the same breeches and shoes as the negro had
                        worn, to the Jersey City ferry, across, up Newark avenue, into the
                        Bordentown stage, where he gave it up as a bad job.</p>
                     <p>On the other hand, fifteen minutes afterward Burnett was following a colored
                        man, in a different pair of shoes and breeches, but with the same hat and
                        coat as the negro had worn, up to the Twenty fourth street ferry, per Eighth
                        avenue cars, where he gave up the pursuit.</p>
                     <p>The real negro (that is, the bogus one, Newlife himself,) quietly walked to
                        the Old Pear Tree House, without stopping for breakfast at Dominick's.</p>

                        LETTER—THE HITCH.</head>
                     <p>The detective found Roadside eaten up with impatience. The young man had
                        only twice heard of him; once by a note that said "all was well so far," and
                        again <foreign xml:lang="LAT">per</foreign> Joseph, the carriage-driver, who
                        came to tell him that "things went on wheels," professionally.</p>
                     <p>"Well," said Mr. Sharpson, "I've got my budget to unfold; it will show you
                        how far back a man has to make the east to clap his bounds' muzzles properly
                        to the scent. Everything is linked with another in this life. A man may seem
                        solitary, lonely, shunned, and yet some creature is bound with him by her
                        thought, if not by a deed. If, twenty years ago, Morgan Haviland had not
                        gone to Charleston and stepped into a tavern, the Great Bank Robbery would
                        not have been committed a month ago. Allentina Fretbury pays this year for
                        the two men stabbed in '42, on account of her love. No atom is blown away
                        without feeding some insects to whose mouth it was carried, or some plant on
                        whose leaves it was caught. But, just you be a little attentive."</p>
                     <p>Whereupon he began to relate the story we know even more fully than he, by
                        aid of his note book and methodical memory.</p>
                     <p>For several weeks' he had not taken two hours' uninterrupted sleep, and the
                        previous night he had had not a wink, and yet there was no token of it. He
                        was a man who must have studied the art of taking care of himself, for his
                        body was too sturdy to give way, and his mind too clear to be sluggish in
                        its flow.</p>
                     <p>Roadside was contounded by his surprising lucidity of description, more like
                        the manner in which a machinist will describe the play of a lathe, in
                        technical language, and yet to be comprehended by a complete outsider.</p>
                     <p>The relation, which explained events in their minutest turns, analyzed
                        passing feelings and rebuilt conversations that must have been secret,
                        seemed much more of a romance than an exact account.</p>
                     <p>To be sure, the explanations hung well together, were strictly logical and
                        quite probable; but they had more of the air of a dream of some fine wit
                        than of such monthly statements of figures as the cashier was accustomed
                        to.</p>
                     <p>It took a long time to detail the whole, and it was past six in the morning
                        when, having terminated, Mr. Sharpson slapped his thigh, and said,
                        triumphantly:</p>
                     <p>"And now my birdies know the jay is around smashing their eggs; they're on
                        the wing, they're smart, they're double-edged in beak, but I've got 'em just
                        where I want them! Before a week, friend Roadside, you'll be a man without a
                        stain on your character, sir! I promised the old man so."</p>
                     <p>"Is it possible?" faltered the cashier.</p>
                     <p>"What? that I promised your father?"</p>
                     <p>"No! what you have told me."</p>
                     <p>Mr. Sharpson started, like Professor Anthon when the wit of the class
                        insisted that the Æneid's "Intendunt acres arcus" implied "a
                           <emph>malediction</emph> on the unjust <emph>steward's landed</emph>
                        property."</p>
                     <p>"Possible?" repeated he, "it's truth itself, or I don't know where they
                        manufacture the article!"</p>
                     <p>"Do you mean to say such things go on around us, in these times, without
                        our——"</p>
                     <p>"You are in the sap and verdant leaf of youth, my boy," said the other,
                        laughing; "there's several volumes more of such tragedies to prove that men
                        are the same, good or bad, in 1867, that they were in 867. You don't believe
                        anything until it has been in the papers? Cherish your innocence! The
                        newspapers only give the bloody affairs in life, where dagger and
                        six-barrels figure, with fellows as cowardly as knife-swingers generally
                        are, or as coarse as the poison they employ. The real heart-wringing events
                        of our day occur under the leaves of the Revised Statues: the 'heavy
                        villain' is some slim gallant with more gloves than a lady, the comic
                        scoundrel chuckles in his satinet sleeve, and the innocent young maid dies
                        with a smile on her lips, though her heart has been slowly broken."</p>
                     <p>"I wonder how you came to find out all this."</p>
                     <p>"It's as nateral as warning a Chinee off a claim of good color-dirt, to a
                           Cali<emph>na</emph>-foernian!" said the stout Westerner, with an audible
                        smile; "when I buckle down to a job, I reckon I draw the strap tight with no
                        let-up in it. <emph>Note the beans:</emph> any individual who puts his mark
                        on a tree, tain't no manner o' matter how big that stem is!—and is resolute
                        to bide his time, will have a chance to make chips of it before he grows
                        cold in bed. And I have helps, you see——"</p>
                     <p>"But you must have had some clue. I saw none."</p>
                     <p>"Very true. Sharper nor me would be lost on the plains if a bluff or a
                        baysalt (basalt) pillar didn't sky up black agin the fare-off blue as a kind
                        o'pilot like. In the 'Gyptian darkness of this business, I was bound to have
                        a light. But when I learnt that Burnett Clanmoran had not been near his
                        dying father—I was blinded, all in a heap—it was like a revolving-light
                        flashing on me. I steered, bow on, for that lighthouse, plain as poling a
                        scow with the tide."</p>
                     <p>Roadside still stared, for he durst not credit the happiness that was
                        promised him—the complete reinstating of his fame.</p>
                     <p>"I'll go you an eagle against a nickel," said the Westerner, slily, "that
                        you'd feel joyful as a bar suck-combing to the influence of honey, if you
                        were let know how I made the find."</p>
                     <p>"I confess so, for it's a marvel in my eyes!"</p>
                     <p>Mr. Sharpson was taking a rest to his mind: those who win mental victories
                        find much pleasure in expatiating on the means that brought about that end.
                        Roadside was not a keen judge or a smart <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                           >amateur;</foreign> but sincere admiration is very flattering no matter
                        from whose lips.</p>
                     <p>"If you say so," remarked he, "I'll let you down the ceilar to stand by the
                        oven-door and see the loaves shoveled in. There's not the turn of a scale of
                        marvel about it. As we have worked together in the problem, you know how I
                        was led to think Colonel Haviland had his line down into the water. From
                        that start, the task was chapter one in the Reading Book. I placed worthy
                        people near the persons I wanted to watch. Joseph drives for Haviland and
                        Gypsy Raymond dresses the ladies in Van Kieft's."</p>
                     <p>"Truly; though I cannot think how you induced Gipsy to do such a thing."</p>
                     <p>"That's my secret," answered Mr. Sharpson, shutting his eyes and amusing
                        himself by opening and shutting a blade of his knife with a snap. "Having
                        good eyes and fine ears to tell me of what was going on, I thought of
                        looking back into the past. I went down to Charleston and Georgetown, and at
                        once hit upon one Antoine, a poor, illegitimate son of the Colonel's
                        father—Girard's brother, in a word. He mended my extra pair of boots, was
                        glad to be paid double; I took him out fishing with me; he showed me up the
                        Great Pedee, where Morgan and Allentina used to stroll; we had quite a time
                        together, considering he's a cripple, and could only look on at my capture
                        of devil-fish. And, tracing the thread from the knot to the needle's eye, I
                        learnt all about the Havilands—Morgan's love-scrape, his flight for life,
                        Girard's horse's stumble, and soforth. Also, Girard had gone home about a
                        year ago, and raised money, and cross-examined an old negress who used to be
                        slave to the Fretberrys. I went and hunted her up myself, and drew all she
                        knew out of her, like the pith out of a quill."</p>
                     <p>Such straightforwardness in finding out things puzzled the hearer.</p>
                     <p>"After that, however many stones the eel might slip under, I had him on the
                        line, and no get-off. Then there was Morgan Haviland to be inquired about.
                        Luckily, it had leaked out from one Luke James that he had had letters from
                        Morgan, who had returned from China, and was running an iron foundry in New
                        Jersey. I pulled myself together, took the train, and a week ago Saturday
                        was at Shiner's Bay. I introduced myself as an Englishman, who wanted
                        wrinkles on the craft to carry to the old home. I launched out upon the per
                        cent, of ore to metal, on the pressure of the blast, the bugbear of
                        stag-heaps, and stood in shirt-sleeves to help draw a charge with a gang,
                        and could have slept over night in the foundry, if I cared. Half a dozen of
                        the men had heard and seen the brothers in talk together; and, though they
                        knew not the effect of detached words, they fell like flakes on what I knew,
                        and out of the whole a bar of facts was completed, welded as compactly
                        together as if a five-tun hammer had sledged on it!</p>
                     <p>"But—but the conversations, so precise, that you repeat!" said Prosper.</p>
                     <p>You think I <emph>forged</emph> them? Thank you! No! while I was at work
                        there, my aids here were driving away. Haviland and Burnett write to one
                        another. The Colonel keeps copies of his letters and those received in a
                        barbarous Mexican Spanish, and in a sort of short-hand, but it can be
                        read—and, while most of it is copied, the important parts have been
                        photographed, and I've got the prints. And Gipsy has been spending her time
                        at keyholes, and reports like a phonographer to the globe. "And last night I
                        tried a little essay that has confirmed my suspicions and let in a new
                        light."</p>
                     <p>"I understand," said Prosper.</p>
                     <p>"And now, my young friend," said the Western man, "let's hear how you have
                        got on?"</p>
                     <p>Roadside trembled and flushed. He found that he had been guilty of a bit of
                        folly.</p>
                     <p>The fact was that, when left alone by himself, the cashier had become quite
                        fully impressed with the real utility of Mr. Sharpson's assistance.</p>
                     <p>On examining the field of the latter's mysterious operations, he was
                        surprised, and, in some sort, alarmed at its extent.</p>
                     <p>He had neither Mr. Sharpson's penetration nor subtilty of conception; his
                        boldness at flying to the mark, nor his power of sustained flight; any
                        particle of the art or science of being obeyed, of creating agents and
                        confederates, of inducing men into concurring to a common goal.</p>
                     <p>When he found such a friend in need away, he regretted him, even to his
                        voice, though sometimes stinging and harsh, which was kindly enough to
                        console and encourage him.</p>
                     <p>He was so isolated now that he feared to move, or even think, of
                        himself—quite as timid as a child left by its nurse.</p>
                     <p>At least, he had the good sense to submit to Mr. Sharpson's advice.</p>
                     <p>He was thus faithful until the night of the great fancy ball at Mather's,
                        when, about ten o'clock, he thought of taking a walk, as he had daily done
                        after dark visiting parts of the town where he had never before had time to
                        go.</p>
                     <p>Unhappily, just sufficiently master of himself to keep away from the
                        festivity where he knew Miss Oestervelt would be, he still had the weakness,
                        instead of haunting obscure streets, to go down the Bowery. He went into the
                        bier garten next the Old Bowery, and while sipping his lager, bought a paper
                        of a boy. One of the first lines that attracted his eye, was of an item as
                        follows:</p>

                        <p>APPROACHING MARRIAGE IN UPPER TENDOM.—The <title>Jeems Journal</title>
                           states that a pearl and diamond wedding is on the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"

                           leading solid men, Mr. A. Van Kieft, with a well-known New Yorker, Mr.

                     </q>
                     <p>If the theater wall had smashed through and heaped the table before him with
                        bricks, Roadside would not have been more painfully impressed.</p>
                     <p>This frightful news, given by that passionless messenger, proved the
                        justness of Mr. Sharpson's estimates, and yet this certainty did not render
                        his belief in him entire, or he would have had the sturdiness to wait.</p>
                     <p>"Alas," said he to the Western man, "I thought I saw the Colonel leading my
                        girl up to the altar. I—I was afraid you would be too late, and I thought
                        I'd do something to hinder it!"</p>
                     <p>"Well, well?" cried Mr. Sharpson.</p>
                     <p>"I wrote a letter, unsigned, to Mr. Van Kieft, giving him to understand that
                        Burnett was his wife's lover——"</p>
                     <p>Sharpson up with his fist, and, bringing it down on the table, split Mrs.
                        Margetson's best mahogany all along the grain from one end to the other.</p>
                     <p>"You crazy loon! most like you've spoilt all!' said he.</p>
                     <p>In a trice, his jovial face changed to a wrathful<pb n="86-87"
                           xml:id="VAC8328-00000044"/> ful one. He rose and paced the room at a
                        quick step, whether the people in the saloon below liked to hear his heels
                        or not.</p>
                     <p>"There aint a baby sucking his fist, from Pensacola to the Penobscot, from
                        Newark Bay Reef's to the Farallones, that's such a fool as you, by
                        Jove."</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Sharpson——"</p>
                     <p>"I swear! You're drowning—a brave man runs up, jumps in, and, just as he is
                        about to save you, you cling to his legs to prevent him making a stroke!
                        What did I tell you?"</p>
                     <p>"To keep quiet, not to go out——"</p>
                     <p>"Why in fireation didn't you?"</p>
                     <p>The consciousness of being in the wrong made Roadside as timid as a
                        schoolboy before the Board of Education.</p>
                     <p>"It was last night," he said; "I had a headache; I was tired; I went into a
                        saloon for a drink, bought a paper without thinking——"</p>
                     <p>"You ought to have thought!"</p>
                     <p>"I saw the hateful news!"</p>
                     <p>"Hadn't you promised to trust to me?"</p>
                     <p>"You were absent. The lines upset me. You were away, and perhaps such an
                        event was not foreseen."</p>
                     <p>"Only lunatics do not foresee!" said Sharpson, peremptorily. "Wrote an
                        anomymous letter! Do you know what you make of me? I wouldn't break my word
                        if given to a beggar—no! if I told such a one that I would be there in a
                        week to give him the dime or two I was out of then, I'd come back to the
                        spot at any cost. You have perhaps made me break a promise given to one of
                        the rarest creatures God in heaven ever set upon this earth! I'll look like
                        a dog-goned skunk, not worth kicking, fit to be hung right as I stand, on'y
                        that the halter would disgrace a hog hit with it after my elevation!"</p>
                     <p>He stopped, as if fearful that he might say too much. It was not till after
                        a long space that, comparatively calm, he resumed:</p>
                     <p>"To cry over spilt milk is idiotic. Let's try to scoop some of it up. Where
                        and when did you put your letter to post?"</p>
                     <p>"I went into a stationer's to write it, and kept it till I had come up
                        nearly to the house—then I put it in the district office on the avenue. That
                        was about 10 o'clock."</p>
                     <p>"So your ravings will go—by-the-by, how did you address it? To the
                        bank?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh no! to his house."</p>
                     <p>"It don't matter. Then, it may be delivered while he is down town, unless
                        being up late last night keeps him at home. Do you remember what the stuff
                        was? Take your time."</p>
                     <p>"I can remember the very words."</p>
                     <p>"Write it off."</p>
                     <p>Roadside dashed the following lines upon a sheet of paper, and Sharpson
                        eagerly read:</p>

                                 <p>DR. SIR: It was all very pretty your locking up your cashier;
                                    but if he did take the money out of your safe, he didn't steal
                                    your wife's diamonds to scatter them round at different
                                    pawnbrokers', where they now are. You'd better not make any
                                    noise about it, but keep your eyes open, and upon bogus nephews.

                     <p>"By the gaslights in the sky!" exclaimed Mr. Sharpson, as he attentively
                        scanned the writing, "that's a sweet teaser for the attempt of an unskilled
                        hand. It lets every thing be guessed at without saying anything precisely.
                        It's vague, hateful and treaoherous. Read it, in the tone to suit."</p>
                     <p>Prosper obeyed.</p>
                     <p>"I guess you have made a fair copy," said the other. Nothing can beat the
                        allusion to the cashier. The doubt is very dreadful of whether he took Mrs.
                        Van Kieft's diamonds to Simpson s or where?' And 'don't make any noise over
                        it,' is ugly!"</p>
                     <p>He stood before Roadside, his hands in his pockets.</p>
                     <p>"Your letter will pierce like an Injin spear—pass!" said he. "Your banker is
                        a hasty temper?"</p>
                     <p>"Passionate as hot water."</p>
                     <p>"Then, there's life in the old dog yet. All hasty men seldom yield to their
                        earliest impulse in important matters. Our hope lies in that. If, on opening
                        your shell, Mr. Van Kieft does not contain himself, but rushing to his wife,
                        roaring, 'Where are your trinkets?' a—dee—adoo to our projects! I know what
                        Mrs. Van Kiett is. She will confess all."</p>
                     <p>"Will that be so much harm?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes! tor on the first loud word from the banker and his wife, our vultures
                        will unfold their wings and scoot! which would give some persons great
                        pain."</p>
                     <p>"Do I know them?"</p>
                     <p>"You know one; very well, too. Then I myself would take it to heart if the
                        pair sailed away without being plainly told what I thought of them."</p>
                     <p>"I think you have enough to have them arrested."</p>
                     <p>"Do you? Don't you mark where my story is unjointed?"</p>
                     <p>"No!"</p>
                     <p>"You don't know how to listen. Look here—did Girard Haviland poison his
                        brother?"</p>
                     <p>"I am sure so."</p>
                     <p>"You're ahead of me on that point, my young man. I have the same opinion,
                        but where's the telling proof? Nowhere. I have had a talk with Dr. O——, and
                        he has no suspicion; and the doctor is no humbug, but something of an
                        observer, as his letters to the <title>London Surgical Review</title>
                        sufficiently prove. What poisons will kilt a man in the way Morgan Haviland
                        was snapped up? It beats me, and I've studied poisons from aconite to the
                        Zambesi spear's dip."</p>
                     <p>"The death was so timely——'</p>
                     <p>"That it must have been a crime? Very true, but often villains seem to be
                        helped by Providence itself. However, there's the first point, Then, I can't
                        find out about Burnett."</p>
                     <p>"What do you want to know about him, sir?"</p>
                     <p>"Every mortal thing! It's indispensable. But we'll know shortly, for I sent
                        to London especially, and Great Britain generally, a man—a friend, I mean,
                        who is cunning enough, and has good introductions. His first letter, by the
                        City of Boston, came last week, and says he has found the first volume of
                        our young genius' exploits. I'll not be sorry to know about the rising of
                        the sentimental sonny, who had the making of a fine fellow in him."</p>
                     <p>Roadside was not listening, for Mr. Sharpson's assurance had made him
                        hopeful. Already he saw the real culprits in custody, and he was imagining
                        them standing where he had stood, when his innocence would be established by
                        their very condemnation.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, he would have Viandra again, for he could explain her conduct,
                        comprehending that she had never ceased to love him. Such certainty of
                        happiness restored him that calmness which had been reft from him when he
                        had discovered the robbery of the steel safe. For the first time, he was
                        surprised at his position. From having been merely astonished at Mr.
                        Sharpson's working for him with such a will, what hidden springs impelled
                        him to show an attachment beyond price? Such was his uneasiness that be
                        abruptly cried out:</p>
                     <p>"Sir, you have no right to conceal yourself from me. A man who saves another
                        s life and good name ought to let him know whom he's to thank."</p>
                     <p>Thus disturbed in his meditations, the Western man looked up with a
                        smile.</p>
                     <p>"My boy, you're not out of the pinch yet, or married. Be patient for a few
                        days more."</p>
                     <p>The clock struck seven. There was much rattling of wheels in the street, and
                        the sounds throughout the hotel proved that the boarders were up. The two
                        were in the office together, where they were not likely to be disturbed.</p>
                     <p>"Seven a'ready!" exclaimed Mr. Sharpson; much rest I'm like to get. There's
                        no time to snooze."</p>
                     <p>The voluminous better-half of Mr. J. Hall appeared, smiling and
                        bustling.</p>
                     <p>"Mrs. Margetson," said the Westerner, "you must send for your—Joseph! and
                        Miss Raymond. Wake me up when they come, for I m going to 'give my boots a
                        recess' as the Big Judge says."</p>
                     <p>Before the landlady had turned to the door, Sharpson had stretched himself
                        on the lounge, and in five minutes was fast asleep, while Roadside was more
                        perplexed than ever as to what his very human guardian angel was.</p>
                     <p>It was nearly nine o'clock. The boarders had quite finished their charges on
                        hash and coffee and rewarmed rolls in the adjoining room, and retired to
                        other fields of glory, when there was a tap at the door.</p>
                     <p>"Come in," said Roadside, softly.</p>
                     <p>But Sharpson had jumped up.</p>
                     <p>"Who's there?"</p>

                     <head type="sub">JOSEPH'S REPORT—HAVILAND'S KEEN SCENT—THE SPY ESPIED—GIPSY'S
                        WARNING.</head>
                     <p>Haviland's coach-driver walked in, the bulldog at his heels. The former was
                        a little out of breath, and his eyes were changing in size, more like a
                        cat's than ever. The latter seemed sulky, as if he had been made to move his
                        bandy legs at a faster gait than suited him, and he trundled himself in with
                        a sort of snarl, as if he'd be delighted if Prosper would dare to kick
                        him.</p>
                     <p>"I'm so glad I see you!" cried Joseph, flopping down into a chair by the
                        lounge, after a pull of his plaid cloth cap to Roadside; "I want fresh
                        advice. While you were off to the moon I haven't known which way to turn for
                        Sunday."</p>
                     <p>"What the deuce's brought you here in this fig?"</p>
                     <p>"Can't be helped! Yesterday morning I <emph>telee'd</emph> to the addresses
                        you gave me to Red Bank, to St. Louis and Washington, and nary answer. I was
                        going to pull up my horses and jump off the box when I had the call this day
                        to you."</p>
                     <p>"Is it warm?"</p>
                     <p>"Slapjack hot! The place burns, and I can't sit still in it."</p>
                     <p>While speaking Mr. Sharpson had arranged his dress, rumpled by his nap.</p>
                     <p>"Let us have the story, without any of your rigmaroling!"</p>
                     <p>"Very well; just as you say. I don't know what you are driving at: but
                        you'll have to let out the whip and come in first by a spurt, if you're to
                        come in at all."</p>
                     <p>"Think so, do'ee?"</p>
                     <p>"I know so, sir! Because, if you hold in, if you swerve, if you let the mar'
                        toss her head, you'll find the team will distance ye—shoot ahead clean pas'
                        the pole—clean out o' the course! You smile? Well, I know you are a smart
                        one, sir; but they are an oncommon light-bodied, strong-limbed pair!"</p>
                     <p>"Did you give their <emph>descrips</emph> to——?"</p>
                     <p>"All you wrote about. They can't leave New York by ferry, steamer or car
                        without whoever is thereabouts, pickpocket-watching, marking which boat or
                        train they took. But they know eyes are on them—wuss luck!"</p>
                     <p>"Devil they do!" cried Mr. Sharpson, "somebody's made a bungle of it,
                        eh?"</p>
                     <p>This dialogue was too transparent not to give Roadside food for thought, and
                        he listened eagerly.</p>
                     <p>"No bungling, sir," answered Joseph, while his dog, assured that there was
                        nobody in the room to bite, waddled to the door, in readiness to fly at who
                        ever might open it, unsuspecting the one-headed Cerberus in waiting. "But
                        they have been on guard ever so long. But something scary happened last
                        night——"</p>
                     <p>"Early this morning, Joe."</p>
                     <p>"Something, sir. The Colonel and the young fellow came to the hotel
                        together, and were blaming each other for having been 'sold' by some nigger
                        or other black cattle——"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, I know."</p>
                     <p>"You do? Well, when B. C. went away the Colonel set to work putting his
                        papers in order; he keeps 'em in a little iron box—made a'purpose down to
                        his own foundry—with an awful hard lock to find a key to fit, between us. I
                        watched him while I was dusting the room. But, by Jee! what a hawk the man
                        is! At first shot he saw—no, he must have guessed—that his darned dockyments
                        had been fingered. He turned white as a sheet, and he let fly one oath, but
                        such a oath! if one millionth of it came to pass, there wouldn't be a sky
                        over our heads for rain to drop from——"</p>
                     <p>"Get on, get on!"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, sir! How did he find out I had been studying his private memyranders?
                        Whip me if I know. You know how keerful I am. I had put things back
                           <emph>more</emph> exactly than I had found 'em, durn em! with such a
                        lightness of hand! However, to make things certain sure, my master set to
                        pawing the papers over one by one, turning the letters inside out, sniffing
                        at them, holding them up to the light. I felt like asking him should I go up
                        to the optician's for a hopera-glass. He didn't want goggles, though! All of
                        a sudden—whip—snap!—he kicked a chair across the room and flew at me,
                        yelling, 'Some scoundrel's been photographing my papers!'"</p>
                     <p>"Bow-wow!"</p>
                     <p>Ketchem revolved and came running to the speaker.</p>
                     <p>"Not wanted—go lie down again," said Joseph. "As I was saying—hang the
                        brute, who always thinks he's bein' spoke of—I ain't more of a coward than
                        the next man, but my blood friz, and I felt sure I was going to be
                        massacreed. Thinks I to myself, 'Mrs. Marg etson, you're a widow——'"</p>
                     <p>Sharpson had become stern. He was reflecting while Joe was rattling
                        away.</p>
                     <p>"I got off with the fright, for the rascal came to the conclusion that
                        hotels on Broadway are rather too public for murdering on even a small
                        scale. It is true that I wres'led myself out of his grip, and we chatted
                        with the table between us. While I was wondering how he had discovered the
                        peck measure in the corn-bin, I defended myself, telling the Colonel that he
                        lied, and a cart-load of unborn babies couldn't have more innocence than
                        myself. But he wouldn't hear a word of it; he slapped my face with a letter,
                        and kept repeating:</p>
                     <p>"'This <emph>has</emph> been photographed by the carbon process—only
                        smell!"</p>
                     <p>"He wasn't wrong; or, breathing on the paper, he made a tiny yellowish-brown
                        spot show up. 'There, there, its——' Something or other he named, but it's
                        slipped me. Some chemicals used by doggertypers!"</p>
                     <p>Ketchem uttered a faint howl as he caught the syllable of the designation
                        which he fancied referred to his race.</p>
                     <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC8328-00000045"/>
                     <p>"Go on!" said the Westerner.</p>
                     <p>"After that, we had such a row. He got me by the collar as I was making for
                        the door to let in Ketchem, who had been quiet as a kitten on the door-mat
                        waiting for me, and he shook me till I thought my ears were off! The dog
                        howled outside; I squealed in; the Colonel thundered. 'Where was I born?
                        where come from? what I knew?' and all that. He made me account for every
                        minute of my time since I've drove for him. He'd make a good candidate to
                        run for School Examiner. Then he had the head waiter in, and questioned him
                        in Spanish or High Dutch—too high for me—so I was reg'larly under the
                        wheels. In the end, though, he simmered down, and, giving me half a dollar
                        for thread to mend my necktie, says:</p>
                     <p>'I'm sorry to have used you rough—you're too d——d stupid to be guilty of
                        what I thought."</p>
                     <p>"He said so?"</p>
                     <p>"In those words, speaking to me myself!"</p>
                     <p>"Do you think he thought so?"</p>
                     <p>"Positively."</p>
                     <p>Sharpson whistled faintly by way of betraying that he did not coincide with
                        that opinion.</p>
                     <p>"If you are taken in <emph>that</emph> deep," he observed, "he is right—you
                           <emph>are</emph> too stupid!"</p>
                     <p>It was easy to see that Master Joe was on hot coals to explain his opinion's
                        basis, but he dared not.</p>
                     <p>"Well, that may be," stammered he: "anyhow, our little disagreement being
                        over, the Colonel went out—wouldn't send round for our carriage—I thought it
                        was for good and all, but back he came in an hour. While he was away, I got
                        one of my acquaintances stopping in the house to telegraph——"</p>
                     <p>"Eh? didn't you follow him?"</p>
                     <p>"A—a friend did. That's how I know that H. went down town, into Windust's,
                        out the other entrance (nearly slipping my friend), and, after a five
                        minutes' stay in the railroad and steamboat office under the Astor House,
                        came home. He's packing up to leave as the leaves fall——"</p>
                     <p>"Burn your poetry! Is that all?"</p>
                     <p>Joseph looked up, his nose erect as if he were imitating his dog.</p>
                     <p>"That's all," said he.</p>
                     <p>There was a long silence, for the decisive moment had come, and Sharpson had
                        only to wait for Aid-de-camp Gipsy to bring her report, for him to give his
                        columns the word to forward march.</p>
                     <p>But the carriage-driver was impatient.</p>
                     <p>"Which way am I to go?"</p>
                     <p>"Return home. Your master will remark your absence."</p>
                     <p>"Pooh! I have been drinking at Dommick's!"</p>
                     <p>"He'll see through your excuse, though he'll not say anything, so——"</p>
                     <p>"Hallo!" cried Prosper, who was near the window, "If here ain't
                        Haviland!"</p>
                     <p>With a spring, Sharpson and Joseph reached the spot.</p>
                     <p>"Where, where?"</p>
                     <p>"He was coming down the other side of the way. He went into the—yes, see him
                        I through the window of the baker's."</p>
                     <p>"So it is. Keep back."</p>
                     <p>In reality, Colonel Haviland was having a two shilling custard pie cut up
                        for him by the baker's girl, amazed at such a rich watch chain and fine
                        black satin vest being on the outside of the floury counter.</p>
                     <p>"He keeps soady, as if he was used to it," remarked Joseph, bruising
                        Ketchem's nose with his bootheel to drive back the animal, who had imagined
                        that the stranger was on the balcony outside the window, and would not come
                        in by the door to him.</p>
                     <p>"There's no mistake," said Mr. Sharpson, not much surprised. "The stag has
                        turned on the hounds——"</p>
                     <p>Ketchem growled.</p>
                     <p>"Now, Joe, do you stick to it that you smoothed his back-hair properly?"</p>
                     <p>"Well, sir, you said I'd left it rough, and your saying so is quite enough
                        for me," answered the benign Joseph, humbly.</p>
                     <p>"This start of his was set down by me, luckily. This man knows somebody is
                        hanging 'round him, and it's natural he should double on him to find him
                        out. How he must ache with uneasiness! I wonder if he may not think some of
                        his black leg friends ain't trying to 'squeeze' him?"</p>
                     <p>"He'll stay there till you go out," observed Roadside. "He's taking another
                        quarter of the pie!"</p>
                     <p>"I can go without his being any the wiser for it," returned Joe, looking at
                        Sharpson while he answered the clerk.</p>
                     <p>"Oh Lord, yes! I know you can get into the little back yard, climb up over
                        the brick wall by the hooks for the clothes-line, drop down into Mr.
                        Gitzfibbons', and slope up or down the next street."</p>
                     <p>Joe looked as if a bucket of water had been emptied on his head, and
                        stepping back he made his dog jump off a yard.</p>
                     <p>"Jee-ru-sha!" you must know all the houses between Whitehall street and a
                        Hundred and Fifty-fifth!"</p>
                     <p>The cashier listened with mouth agape, alternately regarding each of the two
                        strangers who, without any show of feeling in the matter, were yet quite as
                        earnest as himself to win the game on which was staked his honor, happiness
                        and life.</p>
                     <p>"Suppose," said Joe, stooping to pat his dog, "I walk out with Ketchem with
                        my hands in my pocket, as I come, and take my time going back to the
                        Prescott?"</p>
                     <p>"Well?"</p>
                     <p>"I dare say he'll have the face to come round Mrs. M., but you can stuff her
                        with some yarn, and she can spin it round him into a tangle."</p>
                     <p>"Bad!" said Mr. Sharpson, peremptorily; "I know best what caliber the
                        Colonel is, and he's not to be tangled that easy. Since he found out that
                        his papers had been meddled with, has he seen B. C.?"</p>
                     <p>"No, not a sight."</p>
                     <p>"Have dropped him a line?"</p>
                     <p>"Not he—I'll bet my head on it. 'Cordin' to your instructions to have an eye
                        to his correspondence I have a little system on the annunciator principle so
                        neatly arranged that he can't touch a pen without I know; now, since he came
                        home, not a nib has been moved. If he wrote as he came along, Austin will
                        have pounced on the note if it went by Boyd's or private hand."</p>
                     <p>"But the post?"</p>
                     <p>"There we <emph>would</emph> be blocked; but the road I came here by has
                        none on, and I came at a pretty pace."</p>
                     <p>"I'll take that for granted, then," said the Western man. "Do you remember
                        Chamberlain's dealer?"</p>
                     <p>"John's? The redny?"</p>
                     <p>"No! the short, black-hair."</p>
                     <p>"Oh yes, about my build."</p>
                     <p>"That's why! Go to your room and make up for him—close as you can—for he and
                        H. often sot at the same black-walnut with Munster Bibles."</p>
                     <p>Without a word, Joe pushed Ketchem from the room before him, and went out as
                        light as Zanfretti in "La Sylphide, while the other two men stayed at the
                        window, observing the Colonel, who bid fair to have to finish the whole pie
                        while waiting.</p>
                     <p>"Why do you seem to care so much for the Colonel only?" inquired
                        Roadside.</p>
                     <p>"Because, my boy, because——"</p>
                     <p>He seemed to want to give some plausible reason, but as none was handy on
                        the memoryshelf when he looked for it, he stopped and added curtly, "That's
                        my biz!"</p>
                     <p>Ten minutes had not elapsed before Joe reappeared, without his dog. Of the
                        gay jockey-coachee in side-whiskers and Sam-Weller-sleeved waistcoat,
                        nothing remained.</p>
                     <p>In a black suit of good cut, and which would pass under gaslight, the vest
                        of black satin, with black glass buttons, with cracked patent leather boots,
                        battered white hat; a mock brilliant pin to a blue-and-white striped
                        necktie; Joe looked like a man who was rarely out in the sun. His hands were
                        very white, and he did not wear gloves to show how unspecked he kept his
                        nails. He looked a strange compound of a broken-down fast clerk, a
                        card-sharper and a drunken school-teacher.</p>
                     <p>"Very good <emph>imitashe,</emph> Jacob!" said Sharpson.</p>
                     <p>Prosper started. He recognized the little detective who had buzzed about him
                        like a musquito the day of his arrest. But it was only by the twinkling eyes
                        of the little man, that the hint Mr. Sharpson gave out was confirmed.</p>
                     <p>"Stop a bit, Hall! Pull down the points of your mustache—you're out of luck,
                        you know!"</p>
                     <p>Hall's features instantly assumed a "lend-a
                        fellow-a-dollar-who's-given-you-the-'best-in-red'
                        and-the-'worst-in-black'-in-many-a-roulette-spin, won't-you,-sir!"-look.</p>
                     <p>"And a bit of black plaster under the left eyebrow. Stanwix was poisoned
                        there by a scratch and it never would heal. Unless he's seen him lately the
                        Colonel will be deceived."</p>
                     <p>Hall was enchanted at the implied compliment.</p>
                     <p>"Pop over the back wall, go through, up to the avenue, come round on this
                        side, and walk in here——"</p>
                     <p>"Hum! He'll think Stanwix comes to keep an appointment with his driver?"</p>
                     <p>"To be sure! the driver's in with the dealer! O' course, he'll be more on
                        the lookout than ever. Then—you'll walk out again, cross the street, and
                        pass the baker's, glancing in——"</p>
                     <p>"To see the time?"</p>
                     <p>"The time of day! Aye! And if the Colonel don't cut cable for fear you'll be
                        hail-fellowing him, I'll pay your expenses for running for State Senator for
                        Dutch Hill!"</p>
                     <p>"Nuff ced!"</p>
                     <p>At this moment the dog was heard to growl in the passage, where he was tied
                        up; some man was coming up the stairs, having walked in without ringing.</p>
                     <p>"Thunder!" exclaimed Jake, pausing in the doorway. "It's Pratney——"</p>
                     <p>"Pratney back? Go, go, you, Jake! This won't alter your duty!"</p>
                     <p>Sharpson rushed to the door, in evident joy.</p>
                     <p>As Jake went away, another man, who was let pass by Ketchem as an
                        acquaintance, came briskly in.</p>
                     <p>He was attired in one of those thick, road-dyed, tweed cutaway, trousers and
                        waistcoat suits that adorn the Jew ready-made tailors' stores in London. He
                        wore a sort of hard, felt scull-cap, with a narrow rim, as English as his
                        clothes. He was a good-looking, elderly man.</p>
                     <p>"I'm very busy, Pratney, this moment," said Sharpson, shaking his hand.
                        "Glad you got over safe. Well?"</p>
                     <p>"All is right; far better than one could have expected. All down in this
                        book—I wrote it out aboard, so that, if any accident, you would still have
                        got the particulars."</p>
                     <p>"Good boy!" said Sharpson, sticking the note-book in his pocket, "you look
                        tired. Bad passage?"</p>
                     <p>"Roughish. I am a little tired."</p>
                     <p>"Go he down here, if there's nothing more. <emph>This</emph> will keep. Mrs.
                        Margetson will find you a bed"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, sir! I hope she'll treat me better than that cussed dog—he was going
                        to fly through the banisters at me as I came up."</p>
                     <p>The man left the room.</p>
                     <p>"My messenger from England," said Sharpson to Roadside. "All about Burnett,
                        he says. We'll see in half a minute—for there goes the Colonel. Ha, ha! he
                        sees Jake sneaking down this side the street. Look at his eyes nearly out of
                        his head!"</p>
                     <p>The Colonel must have thought that an old and undesirable acquaintance had
                        appeared. He waited but to see that the seeming Stanwix entered the same
                        hotel where he had seen his servant disappear, and then left the
                        baker's.</p>
                     <p>At the same time, Jake came into the room.</p>
                     <p>"Don't be in a hurry," said Sharpson, "it works like salts! He's out on the
                        walk. Show yourself at the window, wait till he looks—come back. Now, out
                        you go, d'ye see! cross over, and he'll never stay to face ye! follow
                        him——"</p>
                     <p>"If he does stand?"</p>
                     <p>"He won't! but if—if—why, keep up the character, play you're drunk. But he
                        won't let you have a word with him! <unclear>Follow</unclear> him, letting
                        him see you are at his heels."</p>
                     <p>"If he goes to the hotel?"</p>
                     <p>"He won't run the risk of having Stanwix's crew calling there on him. He
                        will not go there. Stage, boat, or car, he may take, but you must follow
                        close. What have you got under?"</p>
                     <p>"Two plain suits, thin."</p>
                     <p>"Good.—Still there, Prosper?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, sir, but restless."</p>
                     <p>"Have you got change, Hall?"</p>
                     <p>"I'll get some money of Mrs. M."</p>
                     <p>"Yes. I shan't look close at our bill here! A last word. If he takes the
                        boat for Red Bank, or the Camden and Amboy, send me word, here. He's a
                        fas-looking sailboat off his foundry dock that could run to the West Indies
                        at a pinch. If he sticks to the city till dark, take care or yourself where
                        there's open lots. He has something to replace a certain sword-cane that is
                        at Dominick's, I'll bet."</p>
                     <p>"If it comes to 'gallery-practice,' may I?"</p>
                     <p>Jake tapped his coat over the left breast pocket.</p>
                     <p>"Not more than break an arm! No firecracker work! But if he is quick on the
                        trigger, put a ball through him! Away you go!"</p>
                     <p>As soon as Jake departed, Sharpson and the young man resumed their post of
                        observation.</p>
                     <p>"Why do you take so much trouble about the Colonel?" wondered the latter. "I
                        did not have half laid to me that he has, and yet I was walked off at
                        once."</p>
                     <p>"What! don't you understand that I'm bound to separate the Colonel from
                        Burnett's business? But, bush! look!"</p>
                     <p>Haviland, having stood in front of the baker's a little while, walked down
                        more directly opposite the hotel, when, suddenly, he must have perceived
                        Stanwix come forth.</p>
                     <p>The start it gave him was manifest; he turned round hesitatingly, and one
                        glance showing him that the fellow meant to cross over to him, the fairly
                        fled toward the Second avenue.</p>
                     <p>"Nailed!" cried Sharpson, merrily. He gave a last look at Hall, marching on
                        the opposite walk after the fugitive, and then flung himself down on the
                        sofa, laughing.</p>
                     <p>"Now!" said he, with a long-drawn breath of satisfaction, "lets see our
                        European advices."</p>
                     <p>He took out and opened the notebook Mr. Pratney had given him. Two or three
                        items he passed over with a simple mark of his lead pencil, but when he came
                        to a long narration, he read slowly. His face brightened as he proceeded;
                        once he said: "What a people the Johnny Bulls are, to register men like we
                        our cattle!" and, at the conclusion, he rose overjoyed.</p>
                     <p>"Beautiful!" he exclaimed. "This postscript is
                        <emph>gal-licious!</emph>—Mrs. Margetson!"</p>
                     <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC8328-00000046"/>
                     <p>The landlady hastened to respond to the call.</p>
                     <p>"Where's Pratney?"</p>
                     <p>"I put him in a boarder's bed, and he's snoring fit to split the head-board!
                        Do you want dinner, sir?"</p>
                     <p>"It is twelve o'clock, is'nt it? Well—if you're hungry, Mr. Roadside?"</p>
                     <p>The meal had hardly been dispatched when the bell rang. The servant rushed
                        down stairs, the dog barked hoarsely and tugged at his chain, and, panting
                        for breath, Gipsy Raymond burst into the room.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! oh!" cried she, falling into Mrs. Margetson's huge arms, "There's
                        something awful going to happen up at the house; Mr. Van Kieft stayed home
                        while the ladies are out, and he loaded his revolver!"</p>
                     <p>"Your bombshell has fallen into the camp, my young friend," said Sharpson to
                        Prosper, who hung his head. "Look out for splinters! Throw some water on the
                        girl's face, Mrs. Margetson, and wake up Pratney. This day——there's no sleep
                        for us!"</p>

                        OUT."</head>
                     <p>As it had been easy for Mr. Sharpson to foretell, the effect of Roadside's
                        disguised letter had been dreadful.</p>
                     <p>After the ball Mr. Van Kieft had taken a sleep which lasted longer than he
                        had anticipated.</p>
                     <p>It was not till eleven o'clock that he woke up, too late for him to go down
                        town that morning.</p>
                     <p>His wife had risen and gone out of their room. He went to his study,
                        breakfasting on a cup of coffee and some dry toast, for he felt unhinged by
                        his unusual revelry of overnight. Two or three letters had come; one was for
                        him—the fatal missive whose writing flashed up in his eyes.</p>
                     <p>It was clearly disguised; for it was back-handed, the capitals strangely
                        made, no i's dotted, no t's crossed. Yet, though, like most rich men, he had
                        often received begging or threatening letters, this one struck him,
                        and—whether there are such things as foreshadowings or not—his heart was
                        pained. With a tremulous hand, with the almost certainty that he was to hear
                        bad news, he unfolded the letter, and read the "DEAR SIR: it was all very
                        pretty your locking up your cashier," etc.</p>
                     <p>It was a western zephyr for this man, whose constant prosperity had
                        exhausted fortune's favors. Never, in looking back, had he been able to see
                        one tear wrung from him by a real personal woe, and now—his wife betrayed
                        him! Of all, she had chosen a scoundrel who robbed her of her jewels,
                        abusing his ascendancy over her to make her join in a theft for which an
                        innocent man suffered! The anonymous denunciation implied as much.</p>
                     <p>Van Kieft was stunned, neither more nor less than if he had received a
                        physical blow. His thoughts whirled about, snapping their usual connections,
                        like leaves of a blasted tree, floating away on the wings of the storm. He
                        saw "black," as his intelligence seemed utterly benumbed. In a few minutes,
                        however, reason resumed its away.</p>
                     <p>"What a dastardly bit of mischief!" he said; "what an abominable act!"</p>
                     <p>He crushed the letter up in his hand and tossed it under foot,
                        muttering:</p>
                     <p>"I'll not think of it. It's a disgrace to sully one's mind with such
                        turpitude!"</p>
                     <p>He said so, but yet he did think.</p>
                     <p>As the first cigar, spite of the sickness it occasions, makes the weak lad,
                        though remembering the qualms, try another; so an early suspicion,
                        notwithstanding the disgust it causes, but makes room for the flock to
                        follow.</p>
                     <p>Van Kieft reflected, making useless efforts to calm his mind.</p>
                     <p>"If there should be a <emph>little</emph> truth in it—some foundation?"</p>
                     <p>To his former dullness, anger succeeded: one of those white-hot wraths that
                        fire a man into committing crimes.</p>
                     <p>"Ah! if I had that writer by the throat!" he hissed through his grating
                        teeth.</p>
                     <p>Imagining that the letter might teach him something, he rose and picked it
                        up, unrolled it, smoothed it out on the table, and applied himself to the
                        study of it.</p>
                     <p>"The man's used to writing," muttered he; "the letters are well formed,
                        though he tried to make them bad. It must be some of my clerks, who hasn't
                        salary enough in his opinion."</p>
                     <p>Yet he could think of no one capable of such a low vengeance.</p>
                     <p>The stamp on the envelope gave no information. He read the letter over and
                        over again, weighing each expression, measuring each sentence.</p>
                     <p>Everybody knows unsigned letters should be unworthy attention, and, for all
                        that, they rarely fail to claim notice. How many catastrophes have no
                        greater origin! How many noble existences have been withered by a few
                        splashes flung by some dirty scrawler on a scrap of paper! The paper can be
                        cast in tatters to the wind or burnt; but, after the flame has carried away
                        the ink, doubt dwells behind, like the smoke from the scroll, penetrating
                        the inmost folds of the mind, sullying the holiest belief, besmutting the
                        purest faith. And worse: Cæsar's wife, once suspected, is no longer worthy
                        the Emperor. Whencesoever it comes, doubt leaves its disfigurement, just as
                        the sweat of the worshiper's fingers dims the gilding of the idol.</p>
                     <p>While Mr. Van Kieft considered, he found his confidence lessening, though so
                        apparently trusty a few moments before.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, I can't put up with this torture," thought he. "I'll go and show my
                        wife the letter."</p>
                     <p>He rose, with one horrid thought careering in his brain, trampling on it
                        like a charger rushing over the wounded on a battle-field. "If—if it is so,"
                        he faltered, "how shamefully I will have been duped! Being so good-natured.
                        I may have been tricked while my eyes were most open. But I'm on my guard
                        now; I'll watch, and catch <emph>them</emph> napping!"</p>
                     <p>Thus was realized the preassumption of Mr. Sharpson, that keen analyzer of
                        hum in passions.</p>
                     <p>After long and painful meditation, the banker indeed determined to play the
                        spy upon his wife.</p>
                     <p>Yes, he, a man markedly frank and straight-forward, resigned himself to the
                        jealous task of domestic spy, whose sad investigations make him viler than
                        the object of the searching.</p>
                     <p>It was easy, however, for him to test the letter for truth. If it lied—if
                        his wife's jewels had not gone out of the house, the lines need not be
                        depended upon. But oh! if they should be correct!</p>
                     <p>A servant came to say that dinner was ready. His wife had taken Miss
                        Oestervelt with her, and they were calling on friends whom they had seen at
                        the ball the night before.</p>
                     <p>He sent Lucas down to the bank to acquaint the cashier that he might not be
                        there at all that day.</p>
                     <p>He had the house, thereby, to himself. Delaying no longer, he went to his
                        wife's dressing-room and opened the drawer of the bureau where her jewels
                        ought to be. Many cases that he remembered, were absent; the ten or twelve
                        remaining were empty.</p>
                     <p>The letter from the unknown hand spoke truthfully.</p>
                     <p>And, nevertheless, Mr. Van Kieft would not believe. With the wild eagerness
                        of one who, sentenced to death, grasps at the hope of respite, he set to
                        foraging everywhere, through all the drawers, taking need to replace
                        articles in enough order to prevent his perquisition being noticed.</p>
                     <p>His wife might have altered the usual resting-place of her jewels, sent some
                        to be mended, to be cleaned, to be reset. He found nothing. Then it occurred
                        to him that on the eve, about to go to Mather's masquerade, he, vain of his
                        wife, had asked her why she did not adorn herself more. She had smiled as
                        she answered that every body had seen her gems, and she would attract more
                        attention by not wearing them; besides, they wouldn't become her in that
                        dress."</p>
                     <p>This she had said without a spasm—with no blush, no quaver in the voice!
                        Whatshamelessness! How much corruption was therefore vailed by the virgin
                        exterior that she had not lost after twenty years union! But suddenly,
                        through the disarray of his thoughts, a hope galloped into view, and he
                        rushed toward it as a lonely soldier to his brother of the file. Mrs. Van
                        Kieft might have left them in Viandra's room with the girl's own!</p>
                     <p>Without considering the unmanliness of his intrusion, he ran to his niece's
                        room, and there, as in his wife's, he laid his hands on everything,
                        forgetful of she respect due to a maiden's sanctuary. He found none of his
                        wife's <foreign xml:lang="FRA">parure,</foreign> but half a dozen empty
                        cases were in Viandra's trinket-box. She also had given her nick-nacks away.
                        She knew the dishonor on the house, and connived at it. This flnai blow
                        shattered his courage.</p>
                     <p>"They are in league to cheat me," he groaned, dropping powerless on a
                        chair.</p>
                     <p>He sighed, and tears rolled down from his eyes. His life was worse than
                        ended. In one second the stronghold of his happiness, secure for all the
                        future, reared in twenty years, believed to be of solidity beyond the
                        caprices of fate, fell to pieces as if built on a quicksand.</p>
                     <p>To all appearance, nothing had changed. He was not materially touched.
                        Things around him wore the same old aspects, and yet a more amazing
                        revolution had overthrown him than the change of day into night.</p>
                     <p>Allentina, the chaste girl whom he had loved so dearly that he had given
                        half his fortune to her mother; the woman who was growing more and more
                        endeared as the hours went by; the wife who had grown old with him, was no
                        better—was even lower, than the drunken creature held down on the truck by
                        two policemen, in the street, under his window, on the road to the
                        station-house.</p>
                     <p>She deceived him—she, the mother of his sons. His sons! Oh, what bitter,
                        galling derision! Were they his? She, who mocked his gray hairs, might have
                        wronged him long, long before.</p>
                     <p>Thus was he tortured, not solely by the present, but by the past, paying
                        with the incalculable anguish of a few instants for the happiness of years;
                        transported to fury by the memory of treacherous sweetness, like a man
                        hearing that the luscious fruit had been impregnated with poison.</p>
                     <p>For so it is laid down: Trust must be unalloyed, or not at all.</p>
                     <p>All the dreams and hopes of this so wretched man were based upon that
                        woman's affection. Discovering, as he believed, that she was false to him,
                        he saw no living thing on whom he could rest a confiding hand.</p>
                     <p>Happily for his sanity, such prostration did not endure long. The flames of
                        anger licked up his tears; and he rose, thirsting for vengeance, and decided
                        to wring out a reprisal for the crushing of his happiness.</p>
                     <p>One thing he could do, and he did it. Calling Jerry, he sent him off in
                        haste to his friend, Oakey Hall, with a request to give him particulars of
                        the life of Colonel Girard Haviland, if they were known. Sooner than he
                        expected, the servant returned in a hack. The District Attorney had sent him
                        to the captain. Captain Jourdan was in and dashed off these lines:</p>

                     </q>
                     <p>This was, indeed, ample to make the banker see how far he had fallen below
                        the estimate of his wife's infamy—how there was really in her conduct a
                        refinement of duplicity more frightful than the misdeed itself.</p>
                     <p>"The vile thing," he cried, frantic with grief and choler. 'To see her lover
                        more freely she has induced a notorious scamp to help her in introducing her
                        pretended nephew. The young villain has dined with me beside my sons. I have
                        been kind to him, like the credulous fool I am, and have lent him
                        money!"</p>
                     <p>Now did he see (who had so often pronounced stern sentence on those he had
                        heard of taking the law into their own hands), how feeble the stroke of
                        justice must seem to the wronged man himself. Death was too light; and only
                        passable when administered personally.</p>
                     <p>He would wait. In time, he might rely on seizing the couple in the very
                        flagrance of their crime.</p>
                     <p>With her eye at the keyhole of the study, Gipsy Raymond had observed much of
                        the banker's frenzy. It was well she was on the watch.</p>
                     <p>When the postman came round, the ladies still being out, Van Kieft went down
                        himself to receive the letters. One had come from Astoria.</p>
                     <p>With endless precaution he worked the edge away from the gum, and read on
                        the letter:</p>

                     <p>"Two o'clock!" muttered the banker: "I'll have one of them anyhow!"</p>
                     <p>He went to leave the note in his wife's room, and was not two minutes
                        absent. But the imminence of danger prompted Gipsy. She rushed into the
                        study, and drew the cartridges from four or five of the chambers. Hearing
                        Mr. Van Kieft's step, she lifted the hammer and puiled off the cap on the
                        nipple it covered, replaced the weapon on the table, and fled.</p>
                     <p>She lost no time then to hurry 'cross-town to give Mr. Sharpson the warning,
                        as announced.</p>
                     <p>Before she had fairly accomplished her errand, Mrs. Van Kieft and her niece
                        returned from their visiting. Viandra, tired with the walk after the
                        evening's fatigue, went to her room to lie down. Mrs. Van Kieft ordered her
                        dinner up to her room.</p>
                     <p>On pain of dismissal, the banker had commanded Jerry to say that he had gone
                        out. In her usual tranquility the lady waited for Burnett to appear.</p>
                     <p>Burnett came with a different object than had ever before impelled him.</p>
                     <p>The failure of the attack on the negro minstrel, who had proved himself so
                        cunning a man in avoiding their subsequent training by his pair of
                        counterfeit presentments, had alarmed him.</p>
                     <p>Knowing by Mrs. Van Kieft on what conditions Viandra would yield to
                        Haviland, Burnett saw now greatly he was in the way. The Colonel had too
                        much money for him to be his equal in<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC8328-00000047"
                        /> a fight bydeputy. He had banked abroad some sixty to eighty thousand
                        dollars, and, for all his nobby talk, the end of that would be a good way
                        off. While considering the best plan to "put down" his embarrassing
                        accomplice, he determined to string him—to tease if not to slay. He was
                        sure, by so doing, to have the satisfaction of rilling him.</p>
                     <p>He could thwart his marriage scheme, among others. He persuaded himself
                        that, by warmly taking the part of Viandra and her aunt, he could save them
                        from the Colonel's clutches, not without adding to his nest-egg.</p>
                     <p>Therefore had me made this sudden appointment with the banker's wife. And he
                        came to her, shortly after two, showing himself more like the youth of the
                        early days of his seductive goodness. Before expatiating unto her, and
                        revealing the truth, he desired to reinstate himself. He succeeded: and with
                        a happy, smiling face, the poor lady looked down to him, kneeling at her
                        feet.</p>
                     <p>"Mother! dear, dear mother!" he said, in his most cajoling voice; "I have
                        caused you too much pain, and I repent. Only hear me——"</p>
                     <p>There was no time given for more. The crash of the door, flung open, made
                        him spring to his feet. Van Kieft, with a revolver in his hand, stood on the
                        threshold.</p>
                     <p>The banker was frightfully pale. It was easily seen that he was making
                        superhuman efforts to show the cold passionlessness of a judge knowing no
                        ties when crime is to be punished; but his momentary calmness was as
                        dreadful as the lull before the tempest breaks forth.</p>
                     <p>He answered the exclamation drawn from his wife and Burnett by sight of him,
                        with one of those hoarse growls of a man going mad.</p>
                     <p>"Ah! you didn't expect me!" he sneered. "You thought my idiot's trustfulness
                        would insure you everlasting impunity, I see!"</p>
                     <p>At least, Clanmoran had the courage to stand so as to shield the woman from
                        the first bullet.</p>
                     <p>"I assure you, uncle——" he began.</p>
                     <p>"Enough!" cried the banker. "Enough of your lies! I'm not to be tricked
                        now——"</p>
                     <p>"I don't understand——"</p>
                     <p>"It won't do, I tell you! Don't you see that I know all? I know that woman's
                        jewels have gone to the Jews', and who took them! I know the author of the
                        theft, for which poor Mr. Roadside went to jail?"</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Van Kieft had fallen on her knees.</p>
                     <p>At length, it had come—that say so long her dread! In vain for many and many
                        a month had she heaped lie upon lie; in vain had she given her life and
                        imperilled her family. Even from Man, not all things earthly are
                        concealed.</p>
                     <p>Some days we see the mist thicken, and the fog banks hide all gleams, but
                        ere the night comes, the cloud melts, and the sun shines through the rift
                        more gloriously than before.</p>
                     <p>She saw that all hope was blown to wreck, and, her face streaming with
                        tears, she faltered, with an imploring uplifting of her hands:</p>
                     <p>"Oh, Andrew! mercy! forgive me. beseech!"</p>
                     <p>The banker started, moved to his heart's core by that fainting voice.</p>
                     <p>It reminded him of all the blissful hours he owed for twenty years to that
                        woman, the sovereign of his will, whose mere look could make him happy or
                        accursed. The past welled up with her tears. In that prostrated Magdalen, he
                        saw too much (for harshness) of that well-loved Allentina, watched as she
                        glided like a graceful spirit under the horse-chestnuts of the Springs.</p>
                     <p>The memory of olden felicities, never more to be renewed, filled his heart
                        with sorrow, and pardo rose to his lips.</p>
                     <p>"Poor thing!" he mused half aloud, unconscious that what he saw was real;
                        "What have I done to you but loved you too well, with which love you have
                        been cloved! The pure joys of our fireside have seemed too tame to you,
                        alas! Weary of the respect all showed you, well deserved, you have sought to
                        trail your—our—fame in the gutter, to gain the scorn of the world. Into what
                        an abyss have you fallen. Allentina! How, how is it that, though my
                        affection grew weak, the thought of our children did not restrain you!"</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Van Kieft was choking with sobs, and her head, shrouded in her
                        disheveled hair, lay all but on her husband's foot.</p>
                     <p>Burnett divined that, though the banker was in the secret by some means, he
                        yet had much to learn. But at the first word he uttered, Van Kieft's anger
                        burst the witchery of woman's sorrowing, and flamed up fiercer than
                        ever.</p>
                     <p>"I came," said he, "to kill the pair of you. But—I have not the heart to do
                        it! I cannot shoot down a woman—or an unarmed man——"</p>
                     <p>Burnett again tried to interpose a protest.</p>
                     <p>"I alone must speak here!" said the banker. "I've a right to kill you,
                        but—you have your hand in your bosom on a pistol! Draw and defend
                        yourself."</p>
                     <p>Burnett had Van Kieft's revolver within a foot of him, and he quickly pulled
                        out a similar weapon, on which his ready hand had fallen at the first.</p>
                     <p>"Get you to the corner!" said Van Kieft. "The clock on the mantel will
                        strike three in a second more. At the bell, fire!"</p>
                     <p>But Mrs. Van Kieft saw them slowly parting to station themselves, and the
                        horror at her husband and her love-child going to fight under her very eyes,
                        gave her the strength to rise and stand between the men, with her arms
                        unfolded, as if she would have stopped the bullets.</p>
                     <p>"For mercy's sake, Andrew," she cried, facing the banker, "don't hurt him!
                        Let me explain it all!"</p>
                     <p>Van Kieft mistook this outburst of maternal affection for a transport of a
                        false wife protecting her paramour. He caught her by the arm and slung her
                        on one side, crying:</p>
                     <p>"Back with you!"</p>
                     <p>But she returned to the charge, and flying to Burnett, it was round him that
                        she wound her arm, screaming,</p>
                     <p>"You must kill me, then; I am alone to blame!"</p>
                     <p>These words brought the blood to Van Kieft's very eyes, and he could hardly
                        see to fire at the interlaced couple.</p>
                     <p>He fired, but the load did not go off. He cocked again, and three times more
                        the discharges were ineffectual.</p>
                     <p>He was trying again, when a man leaped in from the doorway to where the
                        banker stood, tore the pistol from him by a dexterous wrench, tripped him up
                        and rushed toward Mrs. Van Kieft.</p>
                     <p>It was Mr. Sharpson, who did not know that Gipsy had rendered the firearm
                        harmless.</p>
                     <p>"Thank Heaven she's not hurt," cried he.</p>
                     <p>"Get away," said the banker, who had recovered his feet. "I'll be
                        revenged!"</p>
                     <p>Sharpson returned to him, caught his hand as he stooped for the revolver,
                        and looking him in the eyes, said:</p>
                     <p>"You'd much better thank heaven for saving you from atrocious crime.
                           <emph>That letter</emph> was untrue!"</p>
                     <p>Unusual events are strange from the fact that they place the actors in such
                        a mood of proneness to impressions, that whatever new surprise arises, it is
                        received as natural.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Van Kieft never thought of asking this stranger what he did there. It
                        was enough that he asserted that the anonymous missive lied.</p>
                     <p>"My wife confesses she in guilty," he stammered.</p>
                     <p>"She is guilty!" answered Mr. Sharpson, "but not as you understand it. That
                        man is not her lover, as you think! She believes him her son!"</p>
                     <p>This too well-informed intruder seemed to confound Burnett and alarm him
                        more than Van Kieft's threats.</p>
                     <p>The banker, well-nigh out of his senses, stared at the speaker, at Burnett,
                        and then at his wife.</p>
                     <p>"Are you a friend of that fellow's?" cried he, seized with a new idea. "Are
                        you trying to trick me?"</p>
                     <p>"Not I," said the Westerner. "I'm glad to see you wanting to hear me.
                        Listen!"</p>
                     <p>And, with his marvelous power of lucid explanation, he sketched the tragedy
                        which he had discovered.</p>
                     <p>Of a verity, the truth was painful to Mr. Van Kieft; but what was it beside
                        what he had suspected?</p>
                     <p>He still loved his wife, when he had thought her all foulness; and could he
                        not overlook a distant transgression, atoned for by a life of stainless
                        bearing?</p>
                     <p>When Mr. Sharpson had concluded, the banker wavered. While his heart spoke
                        forgiveness and oblivion, his hand itched for imbrument in blood.</p>
                     <p>Yet, had not Burnett been there, the living evidence of a past misstep, he
                        would not have hesitated. Morgan Havil and being dead, he would have opened
                        his arms to his wife.</p>
                     <p>But Burnett prevented that.</p>
                     <p>"Is that your son?" he demanded of his wife. "The man who has stripped you
                        and swindled me!"</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Van Kieft had not a word to reply. Happily a spokesman was present.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, yes," said Mr. Sharpson, chuckling. "Mrs. Van Kieft will say she thinks
                        that's her hopeful; but he plucked her too remorselessly to belong to that
                        branch of the Haviland wildfowl!"</p>
                     <p>Burnett had been skillfully trying to reach the door, but the Western man
                        seemed to be always in his way.</p>
                     <p>"Begorra!" cried he, in a changed voice, "is this the shtoyle that yees are
                        goin' for to gave us widout hearin' the and av the shtory? Shame to yer
                        manners!"</p>
                     <p>The tone and the mocking look were a flood of light to the young man.</p>
                     <p>"That —— Irish nigger!" cried he, with an oath, starting back.</p>
                     <p>"You've your hand on it!" returned Sharpson, not at all denying the
                        recognition. "I'm the jolly old Buckley, John Drew, that you cracked your
                        little practical jokes on after we left the ball last night! I've the bump
                        on my head this moment—the bump of historical research, I am a-thinking; for
                        your life-yarn, as my friend, Knedward Buntline, says, oozes out of my
                        fingers'-ends! You keep quiet! So modest! Good again! there's nothing so
                        becomes a man in—in—hang it! somebody's stole my Shakspeare again!"</p>
                     <p>"'Verily,' as Brother Beecher remarks, 'you are a successful provider for
                        Samaritan's succoring!"</p>
                     <p>"Into what depth of scoundrelism have we fallen," muttered Mrs. Van Kieft,
                        hearing without understanding.</p>
                     <p>"It is necessary that you should know," said the Westerner, becoming serious
                        again. "After what I have acquainted you with, this to follow is a trifle.
                        The woman whom Mrs. Fretbury entrusted with a child, took little care of it
                        on the passage home. It died of croup before the year had passed——"</p>
                     <p>Burnett shook his head.</p>
                     <p>"I go by seal and ink, not words," said Sharpson; "here are the doctor's
                        certificate, the coroner's, the burial, the Rev. Vicar Hodgman's of
                        Rickmansworth. Lincolnshire, England—all stamped by the spread eagle of the
                        American Legation in London. The baby died. When Haviland wanted a son to
                        his brother, he looked no further than this city, where our young fr—I mean
                        room-mate—was at the time. He was 'a good enough MORGAN' for him!"</p>
                     <p>"Mrs. Van Kieft was in a pitable state, and yet hope was springing up within
                        her. Her anxiety had been keen for such a time, that the truth was
                        incredible relief.</p>
                     <p>"Is it so—is it so?" she murmured.</p>
                     <p>"What!" exclaimed the banker; "can such deceptions be carried on in our
                        day?"</p>
                     <p>"No, sir, it's false," said Burnett, stoutly.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, you want the <emph>whole</emph> of the indictment read," said the
                        Western man to the latter only. "I'll tell you what you know best yourself.
                        About 1847, as Lennox, or Gronou or Berkeley will show us, Lord Dicombe,
                        Becher Dicombe, fifth Earl of Sedgeley-on-the-wash, fell in love with an
                        actress of the York Theater, whom he followed up to London, and would have
                        married in his folly, but for friends. 'There's a way of
                           <emph>raccommoding</emph> all these things!' and she became, <foreign
                           xml:lang="FRA">a la</foreign> Lady Barrymore, a countess, without being
                        well able to account-ess for the legality of her title. To prove the
                        'friends' sound in argument, the passion was 'touch' for a year and 'go'
                        thereafter. She could not return to the stage after her parade just within
                        the pale of blue-oo-oo blood! and poor, pretty, foolish thing, she died
                        nursing her son. Her son—Mr. Burnett—before us! In moral England, they 'made
                        bup a puss' for Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Exeter Hall-baloo'd at Southern
                        planters making their by-sons work for a living; but it would be new to me
                        to see a scorcher in a British journal against the Earl of Sedgeley, for
                        having let that poor young fool die in Finbury lodgings, and only after much
                        pressing for recommending James Spurling for a place in a great stable of
                        the North, Earl's son a jockey!"</p>
                     <p>Burnett simply looked as if pistoling the speaker, and thus lancing the bump
                        his slung-shot had raised on his head, would have been most agreeable. But
                        Sharpson had an eye on him and smiled as he continued:</p>
                     <p>"Up to sixteen, James had behaved himself well; and he was a sharp,
                        'clever,' as they say there, handsome boy. He won a race of some moment, and
                        attracted his own father's attention for saving what he had otherwise stood
                        to lose. Mr. Earl, thinking the lad did not know who he was, took him in his
                        own household, and let his chaplain teach him. The latter was a collegian,
                        whose heart had been broken by his too great learning having spoilt his
                        money prospects, and so prevented his aspirations to an honorable miss
                        coming true. He wanted something to cling to; he was better than a father to
                        James Spurling, and grounded him in knowledge that ought to have made a man
                        of him. But the youth, always burning under a calm exterior, to resent the
                        line drawn between the offspring of 'fat Adonises' 'En-cumberlands' and
                        Sussexes, who are social favorites, and of earls and marquises, who are only
                        fit for sinecures in out-of-the-way parts or in—Ireland; but Spurling, I
                        say, had his mother's wrongs on his heart.</p>
                     <p>"He got hold of some valuable papers from the library, packed them up in
                        safety, drew a large sum out of the village bank by forged checks, and went
                        off, defying his father, under penalty of publishing the damning letters in
                           <title>Reynolds' Newspaper,</title> to make a charge against him.</p>
                     <p>"To London, of course! where he speedily ran through his money, what he
                        added to his income by betting vanishing by cards; for he did not know their
                        points as he did those of a<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC8328-00000048"/> horse.
                        Betting led him to swindling. I have a list of convictions against him, but

                     <p>Released from prison, the blood of the actress showed forth. He went to the
                        old managers, who had told the stories so often as to believe them
                        themselves, of amours with beauties who had acted under them (it is their
                        custom, by-the-by, poor old alarmists of ballet-girls and bowers-down to
                        plump commediennes). They had falsely embellished their crowings with
                        adventures of his mother to that extent that they could not refuse him a
                        chance to come out. He came out as the young nobleman in "Scenes at
                        Crocktord's" and copying an <foreign xml:lang="FRA">habitue,</foreign> his
                        personation took. Papers said he looked as if he really had walked into the
                        room of rakes and rakers to lose a fortune. He <emph>had</emph> lost a
                        fortune there, and naturally played to the life. But alas! his calligraphy
                        ruined him. He wanted to play the O'Brien, without the Lady Susan to match
                        him. He had recourse to another imitation of his <emph>early</emph>
                        experiments; and the Jew into whose hands it fell was so enraged at having
                        been done, that nothing less than an Old Bailey affair impended. For the
                        last time, Lord Dicombe opened his cash-box. James took the money and came
                        to New York by the very roundabout way of the continent. He had been here
                        four years, living by card-play and trying to bite Yankees by the commission
                        betting-agent business, when Col. Haviland offered him 'lashings' to turn
                        actor again in a little original <unclear>play</unclear> of his own——"</p>
                     <p>Burnett had been very careless to all this.</p>
                     <p>"Now, then" said he, "what is it for? <emph>You</emph> ain't from
                        England?"</p>
                     <p>"Not me! At present," said the Western man, smiling, "I am merely Mr.
                        Roadside's friend. It depends on you what else I may turn out. Where are
                        those pawnbroker's tickets?</p>
                     <p>"With the money?"</p>
                     <p>"Thanks for your frankness. Then I know where to look for both, since—(he
                        walked over to the sofa, stood on it, opened the hot-air register, and
                        pulled out a small parcel)—the bills are here!"</p>
                     <p>He flung down the quantity of bank-bills and pawn-tickets on the
                        toilet-table.</p>
                     <p>Burnett, the moment Sharpson had left his place, darted out of the door.</p>
                     <p>"He is off!" cried Mr. Van Kieft.</p>
                     <p>"He'd be a double-distilled donkey if he wasn't," replied Mr. Sharpson,
                        without turning his head. "Do you want to have your house besieged with
                        reporters, hungry for particulars of how the rascals plundered your
                        wife?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh, sir!"</p>
                     <p>"Let him go with what he has. English officers have come over to take him as
                        he flies by the Ville de Nantes—I have kept back that he is wanted by the
                        city of London police for murder!"</p>
                     <p>"Murder!" screamed Mrs. Van Kieft.</p>
                     <p>"Of a dancing-girl at Sadler's Wells. An old carpenter swears he saw him at
                        the crank when the drop-curtain came down by the run, nearly struck Mrs.
                        Edgar, and killed this poor thing."</p>
                     <p>"I am horrified!" said the banker, not knowing which way to turn. Like
                        others, he was liable to Mr. Sharpson's influence. At last, he comprehended
                        that he owed to him more than life. His gratitude was not slow to be
                        expressed, for he seized the Western man's hand, and in a shaken voice
                        said:</p>
                     <p>"How can I ever prove to you how thankful I am?"</p>
                     <p>"If it comes to that," said Sharpson, smiling, "I have a favor to ask you. I
                        am a friend of Prosper Roadside's, and wish him set up again. He loves Miss
                        Oestervelt, who is, I believe, Colonel Haviland's intended! But if Dr.
                        Taylor's analysis of poor Morgan Haviland's exhumed remains——"</p>
                     <p>"Pause, sir. That man is out of the question, fratricide or less. Viandra
                        shall be Prosper's wife," interrupted Mr. Van Kieft. "I will do what is
                        right with Prosper, so public y that not a soul can reproach him for my
                        hasty misconduct."</p>
                     <p>"I thank you, in his name," said Sharpson, quietly leaving the room, for he
                        heard Mrs. Van Kieft exclaiming, "Andrew! Andrew!" and then the banker's
                        reply:</p>
                     <p>"I will not be so mad as to resist my heart. I'll not forgive, but I'll
                        forget all!"</p>
                     <p>By this time, Mr. Sharpson had reached the door, letting himself out.</p>
                     <p>"I suppose Gipsy has gone to tell Miss Oestervelt the story, for I'll take
                        my oath I heard breathing at the door. Ah, women!"</p>

                     <p>But a minute before Mr. Sharpson descended the stars to quit the banker's,
                        Burnett, with the light, hesitating tread of one who had seen one mine
                        sprung under his feet, and now dreaded a second at every step, had stolen
                        down them. On the rug at the foot, a figure was standing. He hurriedly
                        tightened his grasp on his revolver, not let go since the duel had been
                        frustrated.</p>
                     <p>The figure made a sign to encourage him.</p>
                     <p>It was Gipsy.</p>
                     <p>"Wait for me round the corner, on the avenue," said she, in a whisper; then,
                        darting past him, flew up stairs.</p>
                     <p>Like a man in a dream, he walked out of the house, careless whether eyes
                        were upon him or not.</p>
                     <p>It was pre-eminent that he should disappear without delay; and yet, so deep
                        was the impression which the girl's manner, more than her words, had made
                        upon him, that he delayed, to keep the appointment.</p>
                     <p>In a few seconds, he saw her coming. She had put on a bonnet and a
                        shawl.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! I'm followed, sir," said she, with unusual determination in her tone.
                        "Run—give that hack-driver a dollar to drive off at full speed—and hurry in
                        here!"</p>
                     <p>Burnett comprehended at once. He gave the money and a few quick words to the
                        coachman, out of a job happily; and, while the vehicle flew off at a
                        respectable pace, he let Gipsy pull him in under the stoop of a house.</p>
                     <p>A man almost instantly ran past them, trying to overtake the carriage. It
                        was Jake Hall. Really, hacks seemed to be his fatality!</p>
                     <p>"Well, my dear girl," said Burnett, gallantly, "what do you want. My time is
                        deuced precious, now."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, yes," said Gipsy. "I know that, for I was listening, and heard
                        all."</p>
                     <p>"You were listening! Well, I'm——amazed!"</p>
                     <p>"Don't you understand then?" cried Gipsy, impatiently, as they walked down
                        the avenue together.</p>
                     <p>The streets are as deserted between three and five in that fashionable
                        locality as in a plaguestricken city.</p>
                     <p>"What?"</p>
                     <p>"Did you not hear that horrid man?—oh, he so terrified me before, but
                        now—o-o-oh! I could strike him if I wasn't so afraid. He says that my mother
                        was—that is, that I am the daughter of your friend——"</p>
                     <p>"Colonel Haviland! Raymond! O. Lord. to be sure he said so, only I was not
                        thinking of anybody but myself then," said the young man frankly. "Not a
                        father to be proud of, then, if you <emph>did</emph> hear ALL!"</p>
                     <p>"Don't talk like that, sir!" said Gipsy, feelingly. "I know, I feel it
                           <emph>here,</emph> what my mother would have done for him, and I'll do
                        the same. Where's he? for you must know."</p>
                     <p>"I should think I did!" rejoined Burnett, stopping to strike a match on a
                        lamppost and light a cigar. "So you want to pay off the old boy for aousing
                        your mother. Very proper!"</p>
                     <p>Gipsy looked at him with her eyes glittering like the tip of a melted glass
                        rod.</p>
                     <p>"No, I don't! I want to see him, to save him it I can!"</p>
                     <p>"S'help me, Robert!" said Burnett, surprised.</p>
                     <p>"You <emph>must</emph> tell me! I've just saved your life. If I had not
                        unloaded Mr. Van Kieft's revolver he would have killed you."</p>
                     <p>"Did <emph>you?</emph> Well, there's something in that!"</p>
                     <p>The young man stopped on the corner.</p>
                     <p>Gipsy, whose life beside Viandra's (the object of her loved one's love) had
                        been a cause of wrestling which only a woman in the same situation can
                        realize, seemed changed from the careless creature of champagne and "if
                        Prince Albert sat beside me" song. "When a fair-haired girl gets an idea
                        into her head, she is bound to carry it out, first, like a lamb; next, like
                        a mule, end then like a tigress," says Amy Walters.</p>
                     <p>"It was pure good o' you!" went on Burnett, speaking absently, as if he was
                        thinking of something else behind the words. "Not so sure about
                           <emph>my</emph> being killed, though; for I can pop 'em on the rise
                        quicker than old Money-bags. However, I owe you for it. One good turn
                        deserves another."</p>
                     <p>He looked at the girl narrowly. She had drawn herself up to her full hight,
                        proudly, as if the consciousness of power to render a great good for a great
                        evil had magnified her physically as well as morally.</p>
                     <p>They looked not unlike. She, American, of the English type; he, English,
                        with a slight American sharpening, acquired during his stay here. Burnett
                        smiled.</p>
                     <p>"I'm glad it's come around so," observed he, cheerily, as he well knew how
                        to speak. "I was puzzled about a messenger, for I dass'n't cross to your
                        father myself—still less than before, now that I have some rogue close at my
                        heels, perhaps."</p>
                     <p>"He is——"</p>
                     <p>"Your father? Over at my little box in Astoria, from the windows, front and
                        back, in daytime, a good view of the people going near it is to be had. Come
                        with me to—you know the crib over the way, in Canal street, from the end of
                        Sullivan?"</p>
                     <p>"An old haunt of mine."</p>
                     <p>"Is <emph>she?</emph>" said Burnett, smiling at the cockney pun by
                        inference. "Cut away, Gip! and I'll be there before you quick as you
                        go."</p>
                     <p>To separate was, indeed, their wisest plan.</p>
                     <p>Jake Hall had not tried for the length of four blocks to overtake the hack
                        before he reflected that it rattled too lightly over the stones to have the
                        weight of two inside; consigning his luck to perdition, he turned and
                        retraced his steps. By questioning two policemen, a milkman, a beggar and a
                        man smoking at his saloon door, he put himself on the true course. And
                        seeing Burnett not a second after he had parted with the girl, he managed to
                        follow him closely enough to "house" him in the trysting place.</p>
                     <p>It was a quarter after four, then. Ensconced by the peanut-stand, across the
                        broad street, Jake patiently waited until it was nearly five. Only then did
                        Burnett come forth from the saloon, a little unsteadily.</p>
                     <p>"Been drinking, confound his thirsty throat!" <unclear>grumbled</unclear>
                        Coon, stuffing the remainder of the nuts he had bought to kill time into his
                        pocket. "He'll be all the easier to follow—that's my comfort."</p>
                     <p>The young man went up, across Broadway and Centre street, and took a Second
                        avenue car. Jake hastily wiped the paint off his face, like an actress
                        removing her color in a fainting scene; shifted his neck-tie, put his hat in
                        his pocket, donned a cap, and jumped on the same car. It was full of the
                        early-off clerks, going home, and Jake had a capital place by the brake, at
                        the back, his undersized figure hidden in the crowd, while he could make
                        sure that Burnett could not depart unnoticed.</p>
                     <p>At Twenty-fourth street the young man rose, having rung the bell, and passed
                        close by Jake.</p>
                     <p>"Pro-di-gious, as Samson said when he slow a lion with a jaw-bone," observed
                        Hall, as he jumped off a little further on and resumed the chase. "Is he
                           <emph>crying</emph> drunk? Hanged if his eyes weren't red, as far as I
                        could see, with tears. Dis am queerious!"</p>
                     <p>It was not until they had approached the ferry-house that Jake guessed the
                        design.</p>
                     <p>"He's going over to his house!" thought he. "And the Colonel! the Colonel's
                        hiding there, to hear what's going on! The young one means to warn him for a
                        pair of can'-elopes together!"</p>
                     <p>The moment he had paid his way through, close behind Burnett, he looked
                        about the covered portico. At the window-bar of the refreshment-saloon, he
                        espied a flashily jeweled, velvet-vested, big-whiskered man, joking with an
                        extensive head of curls and elaborately crimped pink dress, presumably the
                        "lady attendant." Jake went straight up to him.</p>
                     <p>"'Devenin,'" <emph>Six!</emph>" said he, in his natural voice, without
                        looking up from his note-book, on a leaf of which, he has scribbling.</p>
                     <p>"Good evening, <emph>Ace!</emph>" said Bigwhiskers; "I'll be——if I'd 'a'
                        know'd you."</p>
                     <p>"I want two messengers. Are there any boys around?"</p>
                     <p>"Loads of the lozenge-sellers."</p>
                     <p>"These are duplicates. For, Mr. J. Sharpson, <emph>see?</emph> One for
                        Dominick's—t'ocher for the old Pear Tree."</p>
                     <p>"They're as good as there. The boys round here know my style, and go quicker
                        than thunder 'n' lightnin' for me! don't they, Mitty?"</p>
                     <p>Mitty was eating a sponge-cake, so she found it most convenient to nod.</p>
                     <p>"Where's the accident?" queried Bigwhiskers, jauntily.</p>
                     <p>"I'll be in the papers in the morning!" returned Jake, winking knowingly,
                        and following the crowd upon the boat.</p>
                     <p>Burnett, going into the ladies' cabin first, left it for the other, where
                        Hall, in passing through, saw him behind a cloud of cigar smoke.</p>
                     <p>It was dusk when the two reached Flushing avenue.</p>
                     <p>There could be no doubt now about Burnett's destination. At the corner, an
                        old man was sitting on a bushel basket, turned upside down, eating some cold
                        victuals. He let Burnett pass him without more than a glance, but he made a
                        sign to Jake.</p>
                     <p>"Hullo, Austin," said the latter, coming close up to him, with his eyes
                        fixed on the little house into which Burnett was going.</p>
                     <p>"Is that the young one? The other fellow's in."</p>
                     <p>"The Colonel <emph>is!</emph> By heavens, I made the right guess at it,
                        then. Who's here?"</p>
                     <p>"Mat and Durant, at the back of the house, in the lots. Smith is somewhere
                        here, unless he's gone for a drink.</p>
                     <p>As he spoke, a second man joined them. He was dressed like a workman on the
                        railroad, but his mustache was in too careful a trim to prove that his
                        calling.</p>
                     <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC8328-00000049"/>
                     <p>"The devil, Jake!' said he, "the pair of them's together. What's to be
                        done?"</p>
                     <p>"Pull the house," said Austin, closing his clasp knife and gulping the last
                        bite of a slice of bread.</p>
                     <p>"No!" said Hall. "We mustn't do anything till <emph>he</emph> comes. Smitty,
                        run round and tell the others to be very sharp, now dark's comingon.</p>

                        HEAVEN.</head>
                     <p>When Mr. Sharpson left Van Kieft's, he did so in an uneasy mood. He had not
                        a doubt that Burnett would seek safety by flight, and run into the very arms
                        of the English officer who had come over with his envoy.</p>
                     <p>But how to secure Colonel Haviland without injuring Mrs. Van Kieft was
                        another matter, and in vain did he run through the gamut of his devices find
                        one befitting the present time. He had turned up to the Fourth avenue and
                        Twentieth street, where he stopped at a grand dwelling-house, on the door of
                        which was the large plate of "Dr. Taylor." He was shown in, and the doctor
                        instantly came from his study to see him.</p>
                     <p>"Well?" said Sharpson, shaking hands. "It is very important I should have
                        some grounds to go ahead <unclear>on.'</unclear>
                     </p>
                     <p>"You can proceed. I may say," answered the doctor, "the stomach retained but
                        feeble traces of what has left more indelible marks in the brain. It is a
                        mineral poison; but I cannot yet give it a name."</p>
                     <p>"I can take him on the charge, saying that you hope in a few days to
                        substantiate it?" said Sharpson, delightedly.</p>
                     <p>"Yes. If it was a vegetable poison, I should not dare guarantee; but this
                        drug his preserved the very tissues that it, as regards the normal state,
                        has destroyed. He is a very learned man who did this."</p>
                     <p>"Too smart to be left on the loose," said Sharpson. "Good day, doctor!"</p>
                     <p>With a lighter step he proceeded to the Old Pear Tree House.</p>
                     <p>Three messages were there. One from Jake Hall said that he had followed
                        Burnett and was going to Astoria with him; one from Austin said that he and
                        three more had followed, or were guarding, Colonel Haviland in Clanmoran
                        Cottage; one from Dommick said that he had two notes, being the duplicates
                        of the above.</p>
                     <p>Sharpson rushed out at once to the Stuyvesant Riding Academy picked out a
                        good horse, rode to the ferry, was carried over and traversed the distance
                        as if he was timing the steed for a race on "the Fashion."</p>
                     <p>As he pulled up at half-past seven, in the street running off Flushing
                        avenue, two men sprang cut from behind the fence of the cottage garden.</p>
                     <p>"All right?" cried he, slinging himself off the horse.</p>
                     <p>"Yes. They're both there," answered Hall. "If you'll come around to the
                        back, you'll see the light in the room."</p>
                     <p>"The second floor? I know it."</p>
                     <p>"There's one queer thing, sir. We heard a sort of a scream an hour
                        ago——"</p>
                     <p>"Eh? Why didn't you break in at once?"</p>
                     <p>"Why, sir! only me and Austin heard it, and it was made and over so sudden,
                        that we hardly believed it."</p>
                     <p>"I hope, sincerely, they've not been fighting over the spoil. But, keep the
                        front door, Smith, Austeu. Jake, come around to the back!"</p>
                     <p>Following the same road as he had taken with Roadside on a night more
                        stormy, physically, but not more eventful, Sharpson reached the orchard with
                        his acolyte. Two men were there, who sprang out of cover on seeing them.</p>
                     <p>"Well?"</p>
                     <p>"Ah's been still, sir, since fifty minutes past," said one.</p>
                     <p>"<emph>Too</emph> still!" added the other. "We don't see their shadows
                        against the 'shade' as we did before that."</p>
                     <p>Indeed, the cottage was very quiet. A light still burned in that apartment
                        where Sharpson had seen Viandra and Burnett.</p>
                     <p>"Knock at the door," said the Westerner; "loud! to let the others know.
                        Again! no answer. Break it in if your keys won't work."</p>
                     <p>In ten minutes they had the door reeling on its broken hinges.</p>
                     <p>A couple of policemen and some people homeward tending had stopped in the
                        street, curious to know what occasioned the noise.</p>
                     <p>Sharpson gave the door a last shove.</p>
                     <p>"Mind the windows," said he. "Jake, come along."</p>
                     <p>The lower part of the house was untenanted. The parlor door was locked, but
                        the key was there, on the outside. The two men went up stairs in the
                        dark.</p>
                     <p>A thin pencil of light streamed into the passage from the bedroom
                        keyhole.</p>
                     <p>Sharpson whispered his companion to be ready, and quickly flung open the
                        door.</p>
                     <p>There was, to his surprise, no rush made to pass him.</p>
                     <p>A man was lying half on, half off the bed, as if fallen there. He had gone
                        to sleep, clutching the clothes to prevent his descent to the floor.</p>
                     <p>"He's done for himself!" said Sharpson, pausing.</p>
                     <p>"No! It's the young man!" cried Hall, holding up the light.</p>
                     <p>Sharpson took two strides to the spot.</p>
                     <p>The form lay, face down—slight, graceful though stiff. The coat and vest
                        were unbuttoned, and the collar had fallen back a little. A crusting of
                        blood masked a spot on the neck twice the size of a silver dollar.</p>
                     <p>"Stabbed! The Colonel's killed his pal, and slipped us all!" cried the
                        Western man, as wrathful as a lion whose prey had stolen away. "You set of
                        loons! not fit to black boots! He's off to Jersey for a hundred, to his
                        works, where his yacht——Eh! Oh, my good God!"</p>
                     <p>He had turned the body over, and the bloodless face presented its open eyes,
                        shining like those of a dead fish, to his own. Strong man though he was,
                        while abruptly carrying his hand to his throat, as if his "swallow" was
                        disordered, he swooned away. He fell his whole length, carrying the body
                        with him by the still clinging embrace of his left arm.</p>
                     <p>"What ails the old man?" queried Durant, hurrying in, revolver in hand. "He
                        ain't hurt?"</p>
                     <p>"Disappointed bad!" said Jake, turning from Sharpson to the other case. "He
                        thought to have the old shark, and we've only got the——Devil in it! The
                        young man ain't Burnett! 'Tis the gal in his pants!. 'Tis Gipsy, 'tis Gipsy!
                        and they're both clear gone!"</p>
                     <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
                     <p>Colonel Haviland, indeed, had been seen to enter Clanmoran Cottage, and
                        there he had been for several hours.</p>
                     <p>Unfortunately for Sharpson's purpose, Girard had been too much on the alert.
                        He had fancied that he was being dogged, and, once in the house, soon
                        verified his fear.</p>
                     <p>He would at once have attempted to fly, but that he had no great dread.
                        Classing the present spies with the blackmail movement which Chamberlain's
                        ex-dealer's appearance had betrayed, he regarded it as annoying, but not
                        alarming.</p>
                     <p>He had been so very, very careful in all things he had undertaken.</p>
                     <p>But why did not Burnett come? To be sure, he had no reason to expect him at
                        any one hour more than another, though he knew he would be there that
                        day.</p>
                     <p>From want of sleep, from the shock (far greater than might be supposed) that
                        the negro minstrel had given him at the ball, from drinking (for he had
                        taken to the glass or two of the "curious old" lately), from some cause that
                        he did not like to confess in existence, the Colonel was off his
                        balance.</p>
                     <p>His <unclear>taste</unclear> wavered; water was sweet, then bitter, then
                        stale, out of the same glass; coffee was cold, though he saw it smoking as
                        he lifted it to his lips. When he looked at papers, suddenly the white
                        ground and black letters would change into fiery print with a cloudy margin.
                        All this vague and not lasting, but still so evident that be shrank from
                        reflecting on it himself. Still Burnett did not come. Looking out of the
                        back room window, he saw, not a man—(for Hall's acquaintances were bashful
                        about showing themselves)—but the head of a shadow beyond the long line of
                        the wall. Some man, outside the orchard, was waiting at the angle commanding
                        two sides of the lot.</p>
                     <p>At the front, he saw, as it grew dark, a shabby, beggarly old fellow,
                        lounging past the door, plump an old basket down on the walk under a tree,
                        and very slowly carve at some broken meat with a knife, a little too new, he
                        thought, for a beggar to keep, instead of pawning for a dram.</p>
                     <p>"I'm watched," said he to himself, going down stairs to the lower floors,
                        and seeing to the fastenings of the doors.</p>
                     <p>He dared not say, even to himself, that this inveteracy of pursuit, this
                        impending of something serious, betokened a stronger foe against him than a
                        broken-down gambler.</p>
                     <p>"I wish," said he, suiting his seat for the hundredth time, "I wish that
                        young cur would come."</p>
                     <p>He passed a knife he had in his bosom down his coat-collar behind, in the
                        fashion practiced during the Lone Star revolution.</p>
                     <p>"Can he be playing under the board against me?" he mused. "To save himself,
                        he's capable of showing all the cards! Yes, he is, for all his talk of
                        English stand-by-my-friend! To come tell me some day, 'All is lost; give me
                        money and let me go;' and to let me to fall into the hands of—of what? not a
                        lawyer in the Union could make a conspiracy to defraud settle on a man of my
                        wealth. Pshaw! Van Kieft himself would pay my defense to prevent his wife's
                        peccadillo coming out."</p>
                     <p>He lit the lamp in the bedroom. It was only twilight then, but the corners
                        of the room grew dark—not a smooth black, but specked with gray atoms, that
                        floated each moment into combinations like faces and hands.</p>
                     <p>At last he heard the rattle of a key, nervously thrust in the front
                        door.</p>
                     <p>"He has come!" said the Colonel, almost joyously, from the loneliness
                        weighing on him as it did. "Unless they—No! 'tis his light step. His fate's
                        in his hands."</p>
                     <p>He stood by the door, which he flung open to show the light, his hand to his
                        shoulder.</p>
                     <p>"If he speaks a bad word he is a dead man!" said Girard.</p>
                     <p>Stumbling up the stairs with haste, the newcomer, before he had arrived on
                        the landing, cried:</p>
                     <p>"Girard! Colonel! all is lost and you must——ah! fly!"</p>
                     <p>The force of the stab sent him to the ground, stunned and bleeding.</p>
                     <p>To Girard's feverish mood a strange and heavy calm instantly succeeded.</p>
                     <p>He looked down triumphantly on the writhing form, too sure of his stroke to
                        care to "mak' siccer," when the mist floated from his eyes.</p>
                     <p>The dress was Burnett's, but the figure, the face especially, to him who
                        know him so well, was another's.</p>
                     <p>Unknowing what to do, Haviland mechanically lifted up the form and laid it
                        on the bed. At his touch, which stained one of his hands with blood, life
                        returned.</p>
                     <p>"Ah! you did not know! I am not Burnett! I am Gipsy! Jane Raymond!"</p>
                     <p>The Colonel did not remember. The girl's voice, and her bosom, shown by her
                        instinctive undoing of the coat to free it of the blood flowing round from
                        the wound, confounded him. If that name of one of his earlier victims had
                        been dearer to him, his bewilderment would have blotted it out.</p>
                     <p>"Gipsy," he repeated, seeing in her but the companion of his rival.</p>
                     <p>"Yes. Your child, father! Jane Raymond of Coventry, Kentucky, long ago—ears!
                        Oh, I am too weak to speak. A man—Mr. Sharpson—an awful man, knows all, has
                        told ALL to the Van Kiefs—Burnett has fled—you must go! you must go at once!
                        and don't—don't mind me!"</p>
                     <p>With her last force she rose, slipped off the bed to her feet, turned the
                        spell-bound man and pushed him toward the door. In the act, the final
                        convulsion seized her, and staggering back, with her teeth closed to prevent
                        a cry, she fed upon the bed, staining it with blood till the white coverlet
                        was spotted like the marble of her bosom.</p>
                     <p>As her face had lost color, that marvellous transformation had passed over
                        it, which starties the most experienced physicians. The express on was not
                        that which she had ever worn in any of her moods, but—to Colonel's
                        Haviland's eyes—the very similitude of the woman whom he now recalled by her
                           daughter's—<emph>his</emph> daughter's—aspect.</p>
                     <p>A sort of howl seemed imprisoned in his throat; he felt that if he should
                        give it utterance it would rend a blood-vessel in its passage. His brain
                        seemed to hit the skull up; he walked as on air. He fled from the room. Why
                        he took this course, except that he might have often thought of it before,
                        he could not have told for the next ten minutes. He was a reasonless
                        creature. Threatening ancient confederates, present accomplices, police or
                        personal foes, were not in his mind.</p>
                     <p>But, with more cunning than if he had had all his wits about him, he went
                        down into the cellar. The small basement windows, flush with the ground,
                        opened under huge rose of Sharon bushes in the garden. He climbed out. He
                        crossed the front plat, parallel with the line of the house, to the wall. He
                        scaled it like a cat, and flinging himself over, spite of several scratches
                        with broken glass, dropped on the other side. It appeared that he had given
                        no alarm.</p>
                     <p>Crossing the avenue, and avoiding it, he took a new street, dug up, full of
                        mounds, and found a singular relief in the ruggedness he had <choice>
                           <sic>ot</sic>
                           <corr>to</corr>
                        </choice> surmount in the dark.</p>
                     <p>In time, his former senses resumed the sway which so unexpected an event had
                        overthrown.</p>
                     <p>Burnett's ingenuity in letting the girl, daughter of his or not (for no
                        miracle had made his heart throb in unison with her own), proved that that
                        warning, "all is lost!" was but too true.</p>
                     <p>His fellow had sought safety. He must do the same. Now, too, thanks to that
                        stab, fatal to the substitute, he had the strongest of reasons.</p>
                     <p>In a pool of rainwater he washed the stickiness off his hand, and dried it
                        on his handkerchief, which he threw away, for the mark of the fingers and
                        three or four spots like eyes and mouth, had come up reddish on the
                        silk!</p>
                     <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC8328-00000050"/>
                     <p>Afraid of the ferryboat, with its crowd, and pressed for time, he went
                        straight to the waterside.</p>
                     <p>There were always boys or men, in boats, fishing, ready to make money by
                        taking a passenger over to the New York side.</p>
                     <p>He was transported round the Island to the cove at the foot of Eightieth
                        street in less than twenty minutes. To reach the cars was a trifling walk.
                        On the way, he had altered his dress in some degree by turning down his
                        collar and rearranging his cravat. On the Second avenue he bought a glazed
                        cap, which he put in his pocket. An hour later, he was walking smartly up
                        Chatham street and along down Courtlandt to the ferry. The night was clear.
                        He stayed out in the open air. The great crowd had crossed by that late
                        hour. He was alone where he stood by the anchor a moment. He tossed his hat
                        over the rail, donned the cap, and walked into the gents' cabin, where the
                        smoke formed a fog.</p>
                     <p>He had never been sea-sick, yet the glitter of the few stare, like so many
                        bright eyes of drowned men, peering up from the waves, made him giddy.</p>
                     <p>He cursed himself for a certain lack of equanimity which now self-accused
                        him. He who had been so cool, found himself hanging his head as people
                        walked through the cabin; or, plainer proof of uneasiness, staring at them
                        too impudently for it not to be forced.</p>
                     <p>A deckhand coming through recognized a friend of his in the neighbor to the
                        colonel.</p>
                     <p>"Going home, Jim?" said he, stopping before him.</p>
                     <p>"Yes. Late, too; I expect the old girl will blow me up. On all night?"</p>
                     <p>"Only this trip—I'm going to sleep over there. No more night work this month
                        for me. Ed. Chairman an' me got a sickener Tuesday.</p>
                     <p>"What was that?"</p>
                     <p>"Didn't you hear? Some policemen had been down to Shiner's Bay, and they
                        fetched up—ugh! it makes me heave to think of it! a—a dead body with 'em—it
                        perfumed the boat so that the walking-beam almost stopped with its nose in
                        the air!</p>
                     <p>"You don't say?"</p>
                     <p>"Lord, yes! For a doctor's examination. Pison, you know.</p>
                     <p>Colonel Haviland shivered, and the smell of steam changed to such an odor as
                        he was led to imagine by the man's story.</p>
                     <p>When the boat ran against the bulkhead, the shock drew from him a loud,
                        unmeaning "No, no!" which made all look, surprised, at him.</p>
                     <p>He hurried into the railroad depot, and caught a just departing train.</p>
                     <p>At twenty minutes past ten, as the train slacked speed at a curve, he jumped
                        off, unseen, from the step of the car, judging that to be the best way to
                        avoid leaving traces.</p>
                     <p>He walked on to the nearest village. Introducing himself to the
                        hotel-keeper, who had heard of the great Shiner's Bay Foundry, he procured a
                        horse and buggy, with which he went by the roads to the coast. He lost his
                        way but twice, and making up for that delay by whipping on the horse, he
                        reached the road at the back of his property, where he had been strolling
                        the night he met Burnett, at twenty minutes after eleven.</p>
                     <p>He drew the horse up by the roadside, tied him up untackled, and turned the
                        buggy into the ditch.</p>
                     <p>From the hight he could command a fine view.</p>
                     <p>Save for the lights that here and there gleamed in the upper windows of
                        distant villas, nothing showed evidence of life on the highlands.</p>
                     <p>Below him, though, the open water, rather smooth, treasured a soft light on
                        its bosom, and the little yacht, or rather large sail-boat, rocked gently. A
                        couple of boats beside the jetty, heaped up with coal and castings, betrayed
                        their nature by their motion in the shadow under the piles. The two stern
                        windows of the yacht, broad as one's hand, let out two streams of light
                        which dotted the water. The stern was of an oval form, and what, with those
                        two shining panes (proving that the captain, as ordered since some days,
                        slept aboard) and the streak of gilt beneath on the rudder-band, it seemed
                        the face of some brilliantly-eyed creature. If it rode silently on the
                        water, which in turn barely rattled the pebbles of the beach, there was a
                        sound nevertheless on shore.</p>
                     <p>The foundry stood in the center of a large sweep of ground, black with the
                        material for work, and with exhausted crust, a sort of volcano amid old
                        eruptions' deposits. Its small, four or six-paned windows, were black,
                        smutted, and made of bul s-eye glass, to resist the splashes of iron struck
                        off from molten masses when the ten-tun hammer fell; and so, except where
                        they were broken, the light did not appear clearly. But some
                           <emph>were</emph> broken, and so quaintly regularly, that it was three to
                        nearly every set, two above and one below, that stood out in the darkness in
                        the black wall. To the Colonel's brain, heated with his desire to escape, it
                        was a face, eyes and mouth—caim, unwinking eyes, but mouth parted in the
                        agony of fever, caused by a fatal draught.</p>
                     <p>He shuddered from head to foot, and he would have rejoiced if the shiver had
                        arisen from the cool air of night.</p>
                     <p>There was a light in the foundery—a low, orange and red glare, mostly
                        smothered, but now and then breaking out. The smoke never ceased to stream
                        up out of the chimney, forming an ever-ascending shrouded figure, fading
                        into air each instant, yet ever there!</p>
                     <p>There were lights in the little row of houses at gunshot distance where the
                        workmen dwelt. The Colonel understood.</p>
                     <p>The great furnace fire had been let burn low, or perhaps go out, by some
                        oversight; but not to let the metal within grow cold and shiver the walls,
                        it had been made up again; and the men meant to come, when the watchman told
                        them, to draw the charge, and perhaps make the cast.</p>
                     <p>He remembered, vaguely, of some important work which was in hand.</p>
                     <p>The silence oppressed him, so that the species of labored breathing resonant
                        in the foundry was a relie. Besides, those forms which his too active sight
                        construed into incomplete faces, were retained so long on the retina that,
                        when he looked elsewhere, he saw them there as well.</p>
                     <p>He feared none the less to go at once toward the yacht. It was not likely
                        that the watchman, if he met him, would speak one word of questioning to
                        him, and, for all that, he dreaded to face him.</p>
                     <p>So, creeping down the path which led from the snug house, where he had gone
                        one day to see his long-absent brother, to the works, he waited.</p>
                     <p>After an endless space, the inaction chafing him so that he vented his
                        impatience by hacking at the bushes with the knife which had killed Gipsy
                        Raymond, he heard voices.</p>
                     <p>Two men came out of the long building, chatting pleasantly, pipe in mouth.
                        All was ready, and they were going to rouse their mates to the midnight
                        labor.</p>
                     <p>Loudly their heavy boots crunched the oxide and coke in their path, and it
                        was many minutes before their rich master moved.</p>
                     <p>He was passing through his own property like a burglar. Where his brother
                        had shown him round so proudly, he was moving like a sneak.</p>
                     <p>He was compelled to go through the building, whose further end opened on the
                        wharf. On one side of it, the road was impassable to him, being a series of
                        crossing paths only wide enough for a man to wheel a barrow to the piles of
                        scale and clinker; on the other, a pile of wood, a mound of sand and clay,
                        and several cranes with gadows-like arms that he cared not to walk under,
                        obstructed the way, especially in the night.</p>
                     <p>The men were far away. He was quite alone. He had but some one hundred and
                        twenty feet to traverse, the wharf to run along, the boat to embark in, the
                        yacht to be reached. At his single word, the captain and his two men would
                        hoist sail for a midnight cruise (to be prolonged to a West Indian one). He
                        ought to have been joyed—but his heart was not a jot the lighter. He cursed
                        himself for it; and because his hand touched the little postern cut in the
                        huge doors of the entrance, he shrank from its too easy swing toward him, as
                        if something within was welcomingly giving him ingress.</p>
                     <p>He stepped in.</p>
                     <p>Some jets of gas, made on the premises, added to the glow of three
                        furnace-mouths, whose cupolas were rounded upward to meet the chimney.</p>
                     <p>But they were turned low, and in two branches, so that they were like so
                        many pairs of bodiless eyes watching the intruder, each against the wall
                        between the windows. And these windows, still more horribly diseasing his
                        mind, were now (as the unbroken panes caught the glimmer) <emph>black</emph>
                        eyes and mouth on a face of watery pallor.</p>
                     <p>He made a quick step, and looking down at his feet, picked his way.</p>
                     <p>Above, countless rafters met and crossed at all kinds of angles above the
                        cranes and frames of the steam-hammers, all but touching them. On each side
                        was a row of strange machines, presenting arms, bent or extended, of brass
                        or steel.</p>
                     <p>The floor was of earth, but here and there, like so many graves, oblong
                        mounds of black sand glistened, while smoke and steam lazily arose thickly
                        from them.</p>
                     <p>In this atmosphere the Colonel felt a difficulty in breathing. More than
                        once he stumbled. Each time he had half turned, as if another was following
                        so close with his face to his shoulder, that he was afraid of being run
                        against when he etopped.</p>
                     <p>Before the trio of furnaces he paused.</p>
                     <p>A gully had been dug for the flowing off of the scoriæ—a grave.</p>
                     <p>Haviland shuddered.</p>
                     <p>By his side there was an angry hissing. The tube, of double boiler-plate,
                        with water running around it in the jacket, seemed to be shaking.</p>
                     <p>As if spell-bound, the Colonel stared at it.</p>
                     <p>He knew what was wrong, that the pipe leaked, but his bodily impulses were
                        so separate at this moment from his mental emotion, that he was stupidly
                        gazing instead of flying forward.</p>
                     <p>Drip, drip, drop! The metal in the furnace was setting down, and the inner
                        nose of the <emph>twyere</emph> was no doubt melting away.</p>
                     <p>The hissing grew as frantic as that of an imprisoned snake writhing in an
                        oven.</p>
                     <p>A spectator of this man, gazing at the fiery furnace, would have almost gone
                        mad himself to see him so fascinated.</p>
                     <p>He seemed to be tracing the lineaments of some well-known shape on the
                        glowing surface of the furnace, just where the pipe protruded.</p>
                     <p>In another instant the cone end fell out, the brick work cracked like
                        pottery, three or more holes gaped like sockets glowing with white fire.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, Morgan's face!" groaned the wretched man, stumbling forward into the
                        pit.</p>
                     <p>Just then a spluttering of water on hot metal, a shower of the most
                        beautiful scintilations, a patter of drops, and—next—with a roar like a
                        mountain torrent—two tuns of red hot cinders and metalic lava blew out,
                        completely drenching the miserable man, scorching him up into nothing, like
                        a dry straw.</p>
                     <p>The machines rattled with the report of the explosion. The gas went out, but
                        it was not missed, for the fire had shot up to the very roof, and kindled
                        the timbers here and there, and the trollevs along the ground, kiln-dried as
                        they were by the beat.</p>
                     <p>The workmen were almost at the door, when the well-known sound of the
                        explosion made them shrink back. They set the paltry little engine to work,
                        but all their efforts were in vain.</p>
                     <p>The building was level with the ground when Mr. Sharpson, the next morning,
                        came to the spot.</p>
                     <p>Some dust of calcined bones, which one's five fingers could encompass; the
                        handle of a knife, whose blade was melted into the mass of metal—such were
                        the sole evidences that a man had met his death there.</p>
                     <p>Sharpson knew whom; and, turning away, no anger in his heart now at being
                        baffled by the Supreme Justicer, he muttered:</p>
                     <p>"It must be he! Mrs. Van Kieft is saved."</p>

                     <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
                     <p>One morning—it was four days after the last event recorded—Prosper Roadside
                        entered, with Jacob Hall for guide, the dwelling-house of Charles Newlife,
                        in Prince street.</p>
                     <p>The room where we saw him once, half inventor's, half actor's, was now more
                        like a hospital ward. A lone bed was in one corner, on which slept a
                        pale-faced object. Whom no one could have recognized as Gipsy Raymond, the
                        gay girl.</p>
                     <p>Dr. C——l motioned Prosper to walk on tiptoe. Hall withdrew; thanks to
                        Roadside's generosity, he had made more out of the bank robbery than if he
                        had been successful alone from the start.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Newlife was standing by the window. The cashier noted that no man could
                        appear to be under the pressure of a keener grief.</p>
                     <p>"I beg your pardon," said Roadside to the detective, "but I understood that
                        I would see here Mr. Sharpson."</p>
                     <p>At the sound of his voice, Gipsy moved her head and opened her eyes. She
                        smiled very faintly, and tried to move that one of her hands left outside
                        the coverlet for the physician to feel the weakening pulse.</p>
                     <p>"Very well," said Newlife, "if you will wait, I will let him know you have
                        come."</p>
                     <p>He drew Dr. C——l to him, and led him, despite resistance, out of the room.
                        Prosper did not hear the ominous words uttered by the doctor. They were:
                        "It's the spine affected—she cannot live—paralysis—she must die!"</p>
                     <p>For a few seconds, Prosper looked at the girl; she could not speak—he did
                        not.</p>
                     <p>When the door again opened, Mr. Sharpson, who entered, surprised the young
                        man kneeling at the bedside, murmuring:</p>
                     <p>"Forgive me!"</p>
                     <p>"Ah!" said the Westerner, rather jovially, "you are punctual, and making
                        love to your old flame again, eh?"</p>
                     <p>"No, sir," corrected the cashier, in a subdued tone. "Only your express wish
                        brings me beside this poor girl once more."</p>
                     <p>Sharpson came to the foot of the bed, so that Gipsy—all eyes—could look up
                        at him, while Roadside stood at the head.</p>
                     <p>"I asked you here," said the burly man, "to acquaint you with the secret of
                        my conduct. And I do so, though it costs me much——"</p>
                     <p>His roughened voice, to their surprise, broke.</p>
                     <p>"Listen. My best friend, good and true, was<pb n="100-3"
                           xml:id="VAC8328-00000051"/> Clavton Palmer. He was the happiest of men
                        eighteen months ago. All praised his inventive talent, and he loved a woman
                        by whom and for whom he lived, for—fool that he was—he imagined that she
                        loved him."</p>
                     <p>"She did!" said Gipsy, with all her force, and that made her barely
                        audible.</p>
                     <p>"Did she? Granted! She loved him so much that she ran away from him one fine
                        night with another! At first Palmer thought of killing himself. Then,
                        reflecting, he deemed it better to live for revenge——"</p>
                     <p>"How?" faltered Roadside.</p>
                     <p>"In his own style. Under the eyes of the girl who had been false to him he
                        showed his immense superiority to the other in knowledge of city—of
                        worldly—of all life! Weak, cowardly, unintelligent, the other was rolling
                        down to the devil—but Palmer grasped his hand and guided him upward till he
                        had placed him in Heaven! the heaven of a pure, young, noble girl's love!
                        You see, don't you? Here is the woman—Gipsy; her seducer, you! and
                        Palmer——"</p>
                     <p>He dashed off wig and whiskers, and revealed the detective's intelligent
                        countenance.</p>
                     <p>"Newlife again!" said Prosper.</p>
                     <p>"Clayton!" moaned Gipsy.</p>
                     <p>"The inventor, the detective, the deliverer, but——"</p>
                     <p>He bowed over the bed and kissed Gipsy. She died as his lips met hers.
                        Another than he would have been too slow to outstrip the advent of
                        death.</p>
                     <p>"Poor creature! God have her!" said he.</p>
                     <p>Then, turning to Roadside, buried in stupefaction, he added:</p>
                     <p>"It is not to me alone, under Heaven, that you owe your safety. A woman who
                        had trust in me made my task easy. Miss Oestervelt received my promise that
                        Mr. Van Kieft should be spared affliction, and—I can be the man of marble no
                        longer—get you gone—to her—leave me to <emph>my</emph> poor,
                        dead—darling—whom you—you have had too long!"</p>
                     <p>On the 15th of the ensuing month, in the Madison avenue church, the marriage
                        was solemnized of Prosper Roadside and Miss Viandra Oestervelt.</p>
                     <p>The bank is still on Broadway, and, Mr. Van Kieft retiring into a sleeping
                        partnership, the name is "Roadside &amp; Co."</p>
                     <p>Prosper and his wife, as if to make up for their past griefs, were not
                        troubled with one sorrow.</p>
                     <p>Stay: it is true that one day, about a year after, Prosper, reading a paper,
                        put his hands to his eyes, and, calling his wife's attention, read
                        aloud:</p>

                           own invention, Lieut. Col. Jehiel Sharpson was killed. From his speaking
                           several foreign languages, and his rare accomplishments, there is reason
                           to believe that his name was assumed; his local knowledge of New York
                           City was a constant marvel. At a meeting of the officers, the following
                           resolution was adopted: 'That our first fallen and bravest shall ever be

                  <head type="sub">THE TRIUMPH OF SCIENCE.</head>
                  <p>Hidden amongst the mountain-scenery that surrounds Naples, there is a lonely
                     dwelling which, in days gone by, was the palace of a wealthy and noble race,
                     but which has now fallen into decay.</p>
                  <p>The massive stone walls still stand erect and invincible. Against them the hand
                     of Time, the destroyer, has been powerless; but the glowing frescoes, the
                     costly decorations, relics of the princely owners of the palace, have faded and
                     crumbled away. Dilapidation is everywhere to be seen. Broken shutters flap
                     loosely against the curtainless windows. The doors creak upon their rusty
                     hinges. The spider's web tapestries the discolored wall. All is ruin and
                     decay.</p>
                  <p>To the eye of the stranger passing by this ruined palace in the broad light of
                     day, the dwelling would appear uninhabited. But those who know it well, know
                     that in one of the windows a lamp glimmers across the mountain-pathway from the
                     first shadows of twilight to the gray breaking of the early dawn.</p>
                  <p>The lamp lights the studies of a student. A student has taken possession of
                     this lonely and dilapidated habitation. Others have shunned it. Many fear to
                     enter within its walls—to pass the threshold of its door; for there is a legend
                     that the place is haunted—a dark and horrible legend, which fills the breast of
                     the ignorant with fear.</p>
                  <p>The present occupier of the mansion cared not for the gloomy legend. To him,
                     science was all in all. The phantoms of the past fade away before the wondrous
                     light of modern science.</p>
                  <p>The student was called Leon Maretti. He was a Frenchman, and was not yet forty
                     years of age. But already his hair was as white as snow, and the lines of care
                     and thought intersected his broad and high forehead. This smooth, white hair,
                     which was pushed behind his ears, drooped upon his spare shoulders, contrasted
                     strangely with Leon Maretti's eyes, which were black as night. They were
                     singular-looking eyes, and it seemed as if a subdued fire was forever
                     glimmering in their black depths, ready at any moment to burst into a
                     flame.</p>
                  <p>He was of the middle height. His frame was spare and attenuated. The life he
                     had led from his early boyhood was not one to preserve physical strength. In
                     bodily power, Leon Maretti was no stronger than a child. In strength of mind,
                     he was above the greatest sages of the past—the grandest masters of the
                     present.</p>
                  <p>He was the son of rich parents, and might have lived a life of luxurious
                     idleness. But, to him, science was dearer and more precious than all the common
                     delights of this world.</p>
                  <p>He had traveled in every quarter of the globe. His life had been one long
                     slavery. Sleepless nights and days of labor had taken the raven blackness from
                     his hair, the strength and vigor from his wasted frame.</p>
                  <p>He was a living sacrifice to the Goddess of Wisdom, and he had his reward. He
                     had won for himself dangerous and terrible gifts.</p>
                  <p>It is midnight in the depth of an Italian winter. The mountains that surround
                     Leon Maretti's deserted dwelling-place are clothed in snow. The purple sky
                     behind those snow-clad mountains seems like a sheet of polished steel. The cold
                     moon sails in the cloudless heavens. The solemn chimes of distant church-clocks
                     vibrate through the awful stillness of the night as they proclaim the hour.
                     Then all is silent.</p>
                  <p>Leon Maretti is alone in his chamber. He has no attendant, no companion; for
                     there is not a creature amongst the neighboring peasantry who would consent to
                     live in the Plazzo Vontalini. The student is alone, therefore, and attends upon
                     himself. The wife of a small tradesman in the nearest village carries to him
                     each day the simple provisions with which he sustains life. He has a few
                     bottles of Italian wine in a corner of one of the spacious cellars below the
                     floor of the palace, and that is all.</p>
                  <p>The wants of the student are few. But the chamber in which he lives is
                     luxuriously furnished. The chairs and tables are of walnut-wood and ebony
                     exquisitely carved. Valuable tapestry lines the walls. Priceless pictures hang
                     in the corridor without; a carpet of velvet pile covers the polished oak
                     flooring.</p>
                  <p>These are the relics of past splendor; things which once belonged to the noble
                     family of Vontalini, and which the student bought when he hired the deserted
                     palace.</p>
                  <p>For him they are almost valueless. The dust collects an inch thick upon the
                     pictures. The moth preys upon the velvet cushions of the ebony chairs—the
                     splendid tapestries upon the walls; and the master takes no heed.</p>
                  <p>But now, as he rises from the table at which he has been seated all day,
                     alternately reading and writing, only pausing now and then to take some light
                     refreshment, an unwonted expression lights up his pale and thoughtful face.</p>
                  <p>His eyes glitter with the fires of hope and expectation.</p>
                  <p>But, in a moment, his expression changed, and he sighed heavily.</p>
                  <p>"The work is long," he murmured; "very long."</p>
                  <p>Then he took the antique silver lamp from the table, and walked slowly from the
                     room. He descended the broad staircase. The startled rats fled as the student's
                     footsteps echoed through the empty house. The steel-blue moonlight streamed
                     coldly in through the unshaded windows, and paled the yellow glimmer of the
                     lamp.</p>
                  <pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC8328-00000052"/>
                  <p>Leon Maretti entered a long corridor on the ground-floor. There were seven
                     doors in this corridor.</p>
                  <p>At the third door, the student paused, and taking a key from his pocket, put it
                     in the lock, opened the door, and went into the room.</p>
                  <p>It was a tapestried chamber, like that which the student himself occupied. It
                     had once been the chamber of a lovely woman—the last Countess Vontalini. Her
                     portrait still hung over the high chimney-piece, and the lovely, smiling face,
                     looked down upon the desolation of the apartment.</p>
                  <p>The night was bitter cold, and a noble wood fire burned on the broad stone
                     hearth.</p>
                  <p>Opposite to this fire a man lay motionless upon a mattress, his figure covered
                     by a crimson blanket, his white face contrasting with the glowing red of the
                     coverlet.</p>
                  <p>The student knelt down by the mattress with the lamp in his hand, and looked
                     long and earnestly at the white face of this man.</p>
                  <p>The man lay motionless; but he was not asleep. His eyes were wide open, and he
                     stared straight before him.</p>
                  <p>But the white, rigid face, was more terrible to look at than the face of the
                     dead. There was no ray of recognition, no light of reason, in those large black
                     eyes.</p>
                  <p>To this man the earth was a blank, for he was an idiot.</p>
                  <p>For three years past he had lived amongst these mountains, subsisting upon the
                     charity of the pious. At night he sheltered himself in dismal caves; by day he
                     wandered hither and thither, bare-headed and bare-footed; with long elf-locks
                     streaming in the wind, this man roamed from place to place, restless, mindless,
                     and most miserable. The homeless wanderer was only known to the people of the
                     neighborhood by that name which they themselves had bestowed upon him. They
                     called him the Idiot of the Mountain.</p>
                  <p>This man was no other than Oscar Bertrand, the Austrian Colonel, and the Grand
                     Master of the Black Band.</p>
                  <p>Suddenly this man disappeared, leaving no trace by which he might be followed.
                     The peasantry wondered what fate had overtaken the Idiot of the Mountain.</p>
                  <p>Some thought that he had been murdered; and for a time this belief was general,
                     and a search was made for the body of the missing man. But then, others
                     reflected that there could surely be no human creature villainous enough to
                     shed the blood of this helpless wretch, and by-and-by people began to think
                     that he had met his death by accident. Wandering after nightfall in the
                     perilous mountain-footpaths, he had, perhaps, lost his footing and fallen over
                     the edge of some precipice. There were dark ravines, to whose black depths the
                     eye of man never penetrated. Doubtless the mutilated body of the Idiot lay
                     hidden in one of those.</p>
                  <p>But it was not so. Leon Maretti, the man of science, had long watched the Idiot
                     of the Mountain. The student believed that there was means by which the
                     shattered intellect might be restored in all its virgin freshness. To achieve
                     this work became the one dream of Leon Maretti's-life, and it seemed to him
                     that the Idiot of the Mountain would be a fitting subject for the experiments
                     of science.</p>
                  <p>In the first place, he had closely watched Oscar Bertrand, and he had seen
                     something—a mysterious light, gleaming for a second only in the man's vacant
                     countenance, and he believed that the Austrian had not always been an
                     idiot.</p>
                  <p>In order to convince himself as to the truth of this conjecture, the student
                     made many inquiries of the neighboring peasantry in the little villages hidden
                     here and there among the mountains. From them Leon Maretti learned that the
                     Idiot was not a native of the neighborhood. He had been seen for the first time
                     among the mountains a little more than three years ago. He had been met by a
                     goatherd in the early dawn of morning, and the man had observed that there was
                     a broken cord tied about the wrist of the Idiot.</p>
                  <p>This was a very small thing: but to the mind of the student it signified
                     much.</p>
                  <p>The broken cord tied round the wrist of the helpless wanderer, proved that he
                     had been bound and carried by force into that mountain-district. This was
                     something; but there was another piece of evidence that went yet further. The
                     lips of the Idiot were as black as ink. The student knew by this sign that some
                     powerful mineral decoction had been administered to him. It had not destroyed
                     life. But it had withered the brain.</p>
                  <p>Leon Maretti knew that there are poisons which act upon the intellect, and not
                     upon the vital principle; that there are antidotes by which the deadly effects
                     of those poisons can be undone.</p>
                  <p>He set to work next to study the nature and properties of those antidotes.</p>
                  <p>When he found that the work of restoration was a possibility; when he found
                     that the deadly effect of the poison could be undone, and that only sublime
                     patience was necessary to effect a cure, he went in the silence of the night
                     into the lonely mountain-pathways. He found the cave which was the Idiot's
                     favorite sleeping-place. He bound a rope about the slumbering man; and then, by
                     the help of this rope, led the unconscious wretch to the palace of the
                     Vontalini.</p>
                  <p>This had happened six months before the opening of our story, and for six
                     months the work had been going on.</p>
                  <p>The patience and devotion of the student were boundless. Night after night, day
                     after day, he watched the helpless Idiot, administering with unalterable
                     regularity those preparations which were in due time to effect a cure. Leon
                     Maretti believed that the work which he was doing was a noble one.</p>
                  <p>He did not know that he was trying to awake the slumbering intellect of a
                     master fiend. He did not dream that the man he was seeking to restore to manly
                     intelligence was destined to become the evil genius of his own life.</p>
                  <p>He set the lamp down upon a little table near the mattress upon which Oscar
                     Bertrand lay. On this table there were several vials of different shapes, and
                     containing mixtures of different colors.</p>
                  <p>The student took up a long, narrow glass, and poured into it a few drops of a
                     transparent liquid.</p>
                  <p>He handed this to the Idiot. Oscar Bertrand lifted his eyes for the first time
                     that night, and gazed with a strange, questioning look, upon the face of the
                     student.</p>
                  <p>A sudden flush dyed the Frenchman's pale brow—a flush of triumph; for to him
                     that one questioning look was a token of success. The awakening of the Idiot's
                     brain had commenced.</p>
                  <p>"I have seen that look before to-night," Leon Maretti muttered to himself. "It
                     will come; the triumph of science will come, and I begin to think that it will
                     come soon."</p>
                  <p>He placed the glass in Oscar Bertrand's hand.</p>
                  <p>"Drink!" said the student.</p>
                  <p>The Idiot drained the glass.</p>
                  <p>Then there was a long, gurgling sound in his throat—a strange and almost
                     unearthly sound.</p>
                  <p>The student listened, with his eager eyes fixed upon his patient's face.</p>
                  <p>The gurgling sound continued. Then for the first time for nearly four years
                     Oscar Bertrand spoke.</p>
                  <p>"Good." he cried, hoarsely; "good."</p>
                  <p>His voice was harsh, unnatural in its sound, unpleasant to hear. But to the ear
                     of the student those harsh guttural sounds were more precious than the sweetest
                     music, for they told him that science had triumphed.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE NEW ERA.</head>
                  <p>Oscar Bertrand lifted his head from the mattress, and looked wonderingly round
                     the room. Then he looked at the student.</p>
                  <p>"Where am I?" he cried; "and who—who are you?"</p>
                  <p>"You are in my house," answered Leon Maretti; "and I am your friend and
                     well-wisher."</p>
                  <p>Oscar Bertrand sighed heavily. For a few minutes he lay silent. The light of
                     reason returned very slowly to the brain that had been so long overclouded by
                     idiocy—but it did return.</p>
                  <p>"What is the matter with me?" he said, by-and-by; "I don't know the sound of my
                     own voice. Everything that I look at seems as if I saw it through a cloud; even
                     your face appears miles away from me, and yet I know that it is near. What does
                     it mean? What was that long night in which I had such bad dreams—such horrible,
                     never-ending dreams? What does it mean?"</p>
                  <p>"It means that you have been very ill," answered the student.</p>
                  <p>"I have been ill?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes; but thanks to the marvelous power of science, you are now better—much
                     better."</p>
                  <p>Oscar Bertrand tried to raise himself into an erect position, but he could not.
                     His ankles were fettered by a silken sash, which Leon Maretti had tied tightly
                     about his feet and legs.</p>
                  <p>There had been a good reason for this. When first the Idiot was brought to the
                     Vontalini palace, he was as wild and unmanageable as a savage beast. It was
                     only by force that Leon Maretti had been able to keep possession of his
                     patient.</p>
                  <p>"It I untie that scarf," said the student, "will you promise me not to run
                     away?"</p>
                  <p>"Run away!" exclaimed Oscar. "Why should I run away?"</p>
                  <p>Leon Maretti bent down and loosened the bandage. The Austrian arose, and walked
                     over to the fireplace. The transformation was marvelous. In attitude and
                     gesture, the Captain of the Black Band was himself once more. He held his head
                     erect; his walk had a proud dignity that might have become a prince of the
                     blood royal.</p>
                  <p>The man of science looked at his patient in silent rapture. It seemed almost as
                     if he had created a human being.</p>
                  <p>Oscar Bertrand threw himself into an old-fashioned easy-chair by the broad
                     fireplace, and rested his head upon his hands, looking thoughtfully at the
                     blaze.</p>
                  <p>Reason, memory, all the wondrous powers of the mind, were slowly returning.
                     Little by little the dark history of the past unfolded itself; and this man,
                     looking back upon the deeds he had done, saw the story of his life spread
                     before him like the printed pages of a book.</p>
                  <p>The time of his idiocy was a blank. He had no memory of his
                     mountain-wanderings—no memory of his miserable life, supported only by the
                     charity of peasants. He had no recollection of those months during which he had
                     lain in this chamber, tended night and day by the man of science.</p>
                  <p>To Oscar Bertrand, the day upon which his mind had been suddenly withered was
                     yesterday.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I remember," he said. "I remember I went last night to a banquet at the
                     villa of a nobleman called Baradizzi. A splendid banquet—wines from every part
                     of the world. One wine in particular I remember—one wine which was as bright as
                     melted rubies. I drank some of that wine, and then—"</p>
                  <p>He paused, and passed his hand across his brow.</p>
                  <p>"I don't remember any more," he said. "I can't remember."</p>
                  <p>As he passed his long, thin fingers about his head, they became entangled with
                     the straggling locks of ragged, raven hair. This long, black hair fell over his
                     shoulders.</p>
                  <p>Oscar Bertrand drew one of the ragged tresses through his fingers, and looked
                     at it wonderingly.</p>
                  <p>"How is this?" he cried. "Last night my hair was cut close to my head.
                     To-night—"</p>
                  <p>He paused, bewildered and confused.</p>
                  <p>"The night has been a very long one," Leon Maretti said, gravely.</p>
                  <p>As the student spoke, he opened the window, and pushed back the flapping
                     shutters. Oscar Bertrand followed him with his eyes. The cold moonlight shone
                     on the snow-clad landscape beyond the open window. The snow was still falling,
                     and the feathery flakes blew into the room.</p>
                  <p>"Surely I must be mad," exclaimed Oscar Bertrand. "Last night it was summer,
                     and the orange-blossoms swept across our banquet-table borne upon the light
                     breath of the summer-breeze; to-night it is deadly cold. It seems as if it were
                     the depth of winter."</p>
                  <p>"It is the depth of winter," answered the student. "I say, again, the night has
                     been a very long one," he added, in a solemn voice.</p>
                  <p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>
                  <p>"This is the second of January, 1858."</p>
                  <p>"1858?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes."</p>
                  <p>"You are mad. Last night, at the banquet, the month was August—the year
                     '54"</p>
                  <p>"Yes; but, for the third time. I say the night has been a long one. That is
                     three years and a half ago."</p>
                  <p>"Do you want to drive me mad?" cried Oscar Bertrand, passionately.</p>
                  <p>"No; I want to tell you the truth. Are you strong enough to hear it?"</p>
                  <p>"I am."</p>
                  <p>"Listen to me, then. You are my patient. For six months I have tended you night
                     and day, without hope of fee or reward, except the great reward of scientific
                     victory. I have won that victory. I have cured you of the worst disease that
                     man can suffer. For three years and a half you have been an idiot."</p>
                  <p>"An idiot!" cried Oscar Bertrand, staring with horrified amazement at the
                     student.</p>
                  <p>"Yes. For three years and a half your mind has been a blank. You have been
                     lower than the wild beasts who roam in Eastern forests, for their instincts are
                     nearer reason than yours have been. This is the long night of which you spoke
                     when first your slumbering senses awoke to the memory of the past. And look
                     here!"</p>
                  <p>The student took a mirror from a table near him—an antique mirror in a silver
                     frame—and handed it to Oscar Bertrand.</p>
                  <p>"Look at yourself," he said.</p>
                  <p>"Great Heaven," cried the Austrian, "what a change!"</p>
                  <p>"You see the color of your lips? They have been blackened by the subtle poison
                     which for a time paralyzed your brain. They will regain their natural bue
                     perhaps in time. But you will never be in the future that which you may have
                     been in the past. That ruby-colored wine which you last remember drinking at
                     the banquet doubtless contained the poison."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, yes, I remember; Baradizzi pressed that wine upon me; and I, fool that I
                     was, believed that he was my dupe. By Heaven, he shall pay, and dearly, for
                     that night's work."</p>
                  <p>The Austrian muttered this between his set teeth. Then turning to the
                     Frenchman, he said:</p>
                  <p>"As for you, Monsieur, you have saved me from death; you have given me a new
                     existence, a new career. You shall not find your patience badly repaid. I am
                     rich, and I can give wealth and power to those who serve me. I am strong, and I

                     injure me. I say, again, you shall not find me ungrateful. Where are we?"</p>
                  <p>"Amongst the mountains of Calabria, twenty miles from Naples."</p>
                  <p>"Good! To-morrow I must begin work. To-morrow I must go into Naples."</p>
                  <p>Oscar Bertrand rose, and paced backward and forward in the lamp-lit apartment.
                     The student seated himself near the fire, and watched his patient
                     wonderingly.</p>
                  <p>He had good reason to wonder. The helpless idiot was transformed into the man
                     of the world—calm, thoughtful, self-possessed.</p>
                  <p>Leon Maretti had expected to find his patient a submissive slave—docile,
                     grateful, obedient, devoted. But Oscar Bertrand had the tone of a master—a
                     prince, who was accustomed to confer favors, but had never been used to receive
                     them. The man of the world was stronger than the man of science. Oscar Bertrand
                     had mingled perpetually with his fellow-men, and had learned to rule them. Leon
                     Maretti had shunned all human companionship, and he had lost the power to rule.
                     He found himself, before he knew how or why it was, the slave of the man whose
                     intellects he had restored.</p>
                  <p>He asked the Austrian who and what he was. Oscar Bertrand smiled.</p>
                  <p>"You shall know all that by-and-by," he said. "You can at least perceive that I
                     am no ignorant fool. You can see, even despite these rags, that I am a man of
                     the world, and a gentleman. In a few weeks' time you shall see that I have
                     plenty of money at my control. By-and-by you shall know more."</p>
                  <p>"And your name?" asked the student.</p>
                  <p>"For the present you can call me Captain Oscar."</p>
                  <p>Early the next day, Oscar Bertrand dressed himself as well as he could in a
                     suit of clothes belonging to the Frenchman. He explored the Vontalini palace,
                     accompanied by Leon Maretti. He examined every chamber; he scrutinized every
                     secret passage, every hidden door, the roomy cellars, the corridors, the
                     staircases.</p>
                  <p>This inspection seemed to give him great satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>"It is a noble place, Monsieur Maretti," said the Austrian. "And now permit me
                     to ask you a few questions. First and foremost, are you a rich man?"</p>
                  <p>"No, I was rich once; but I set very little value upon wealth, and my brother,
                     who was a villain, contrived to deprive me of my fortune. I have enough to pay
                     the rent of this place, which is let to me for fifty pounds a year, on account
                     of its bad reputation and dilapidated state, and I have enough to supply my own
                     wants, which are very simple."</p>
                  <p>"But do you not wish for wealth?"</p>
                  <p>"Sometimes, when I find wealth necessary to the pursuits of science."</p>
                  <p>"You shall have wealth, then," exclaimed Oscar Bertrand, laying his hand upon
                     the shoulder of the Frenchman. "You shall have money enough for every
                     scientific caprice, however wild. You shall be my adopted brother, if you will.
                     You have given me memory, intellect—all that makes existence valuable. It shall
                     be my task to give you wealth and power. You are ambitious—I see the fire of
                     ambition in the feverish sparkle of your eyes; but your ambition is of a
                     different kind from mine. I will help you, and you shall help me. Speak,
                     brother; is this a compact?"</p>
                  <p>Oscar Bertrand stretched out his hand as he spoke. There was a wonderful
                     fascination in this man's manner. His influence upon others was almost like
                     some magic spell. He was beloved, admired, obeyed.</p>
                  <p>Leon Maretti clasped the Austrian's outstretched hand in both his own.</p>
                  <p>"It is a compact," the student said. "I know not why it is that I am ready to
                     serve you, and to accept this tie of brotherhood. You are a stranger to me; I
                     know nothing of the secrets of your life, yet, I say to you, brother. I will
                     serve you faithfully."</p>
                  <p>"And you swear this?"</p>
                  <p>"I do," answered Leon Maretti, "by all that is most sacred to me."</p>
                  <p>"Good! We shall be strong, brother; united. Science and knowledge of the world
                     are the two great powers by which the earth is ruled. You and I will share
                     these powers. We shall be kings. In a month's time you shall see the place
                     restored to its ancient grandeur. New tapestries shall line the walls—new
                     statues glimmer whitely against the back-ground of a purple sky. You shall see
                     a palace that Aladdin might have built—that princes will envy. Trust in me,
                     brother, and obey."</p>
                  <p>"I will obey."</p>
                  <p>"And remember," exclaimed Oscar Bertrand, "the secrets of the past must be
                     vailed in impenetrable mystery. Not a word of your marvelous cure—not a breath,
                     not a whisper. Remember that our future greatness depends upon this."</p>
                  <p>"I shall remember."</p>
                  <p>Oscar Bertrand took possession of a suite of apartments which the student
                     offered to him. He asked for pen, ink, and paper; and he remained for the whole
                     of the day writing voluminous and closely-written letters, upon thin foreign
                     paper.</p>
                  <p>One letter was directed to the office of the Times newspaper, Printing House
                     Square, London.</p>
                  <p>A fortnight after the recovery of Oscar Bertrand, an advertisement appeared in
                     the Times. It was worded thus:</p>

                  <p>These six initials represented the words Oscar Bertrand, Grand Master of the
                     Black Band.</p>
                  <p>A fortnight after the appearance of this advertisement, Oscar Bertrand left the
                     Vontalini palace upon horseback, in the dim winter twilight. He had taken care
                     to disguise himself in a large horseman's cloak and a slouched hat, which
                     overshadowed and concealed his face. The horse had been bought within the last
                     week by Leon Maretti, ostensibly for his own use, but in reality for the
                     service of the Austrian.</p>
                  <p>The neighboring peasantry, the nearest of whom lived three miles from the
                     Vontalini palaces, knew not as yet that the student had a companion in his
                     solitude.</p>
                  <p>Oscar Bertrand rode into Naples. He went straight to a humble hostelry—a
                     disreputable little tavern, hidden away in one of the most obscure streets.</p>
                  <p>Here he put up his horse.</p>
                  <p>In every city of Europe the members of the Black Band had some chosen
                     meeting-place where they and their secrets were safe. It was generally some
                     tavern, the landlord of which was a sworn member of the association, and who
                     knew that if he chose to turn traitor he would most likely pay for his
                     treachery by the loss of his life.</p>
                  <p>Oscar Bertrand entered the low doorway of the tavern. The host was loitering in
                     the dark passage leading to the small chamber.</p>
                  <p>"Pietro Malquez!" said the Austrian.</p>
                  <p>The man started as if a gun had been discharged close to his ear.</p>
                  <p>"Merciful Powers!" he cried, "it is the voice of our dead Captain."</p>
                  <p>Oscar Bertrand lifted the slouched hat.</p>
                  <p>"Not dead, Pietro," he answered; "look at me, and convince yourself."</p>
                  <p>The man stared aghast at the pale face of the Austrian. The handsome features,
                     the flashing black eyes, still remained; but the face was careworn, the cheeks
                     hollow and sunken, and the blackness of the lips gave a strange and ghastly
                     look to the countenance.</p>
                  <p>"Not dead," muttered the landlord, "not dead; out changed—terribly
                     changed."</p>
                  <p>"Are there any of our Companions here, Pietro Malquez?" asked Oscar
                     Bertrand.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, Captain, there are at least a dozen of them in yonder chamber. They came
                     by the Marseilles steamer that arrived this afternoon. I tried to find out why
                     they had come, but it was no use. They were as silent as if they had been born
                     dumb."</p>
                  <p>"Good!" exclaimed Oscar Bertrand; "my children obey their master. Follow me,
                     Pietro Malquez."</p>
                  <p>The Austrian led the way to the chamber to which the host had pointed. He
                     opened the door and went in. He had his hat in his hand, and his long black
                     hair, now smooth and glossy, was brushed back from his pallid face, and tell
                     upon his shoulders.</p>
                  <p>He looked almost like a ghost newly risen from the dead. For three years and a
                     half no one had heard of him; no one had seen him. He had been given up as
                     dead.</p>
                  <p>Seven men, all dressed more or less like gentlemen, were sitting round a table
                     in the low dark room. They had come from England and France in answer to the
                     advertisement which had appeared in the Times newspaper.</p>
                  <p>To these men, who were great when directed, but who were nothing when left to
                     themselves, Oscar Bertrand's reappearance was unspeakably welcome.</p>
                  <p>Simultaneously they burst into one loud huzza.</p>
                  <p>The Captain commanded silence by a gesture of his hand.</p>
                  <p>"I have returned to you," he said; "but I am not sure of my welcome. I have
                     been absent for a long time. During my absence you may have chosen a new
                     Captain."</p>
                  <p>"No!" cried one of the men, "we have chosen no other Captain, for we found no
                     one worthy to command us. We have been faithful to our first and last
                     master."</p>
                  <p>"Good!" exclaimed Oscar Bertrand, "your fidelity shall be richly rewarded. From
                     this night a new era commences for us. The Associates of the Black Band shall
                     hence forward be more powerful than they have ever been yet. Bring us your
                     rarest wine, Pietro Malquez; we will drink to the new era.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE LONELY INN.</head>
                  <p>It was six weeks after the meeting in the tavern of Pietro Malquez, the
                     Neapolitan. It was at the close of the month of February. The mountains were
                     still clad with their white shroud of unsullied snow. The weather was still
                     bleak and cold. An icy wind blew in the face of the traveler who ventured upon
                     those mountain-pathways.</p>
                  <p>Two men on horseback rode side by side along the most sheltered of the
                     mountain-roads. Their horses were good. The travelers were evidently men of
                     some standing. One of them had a very aristocratic cast of countenance; but, in
                     spite of the refinement of his features, his face was not a pleasant one to
                     look at.</p>
                  <p>The aquiline nose was delicate in shape, the eyes were blue, the complexion
                     fair as that of a woman. Put there was a sinister expression in the radiant
                     blue eyes, a look of cunning in the mouth, a contraction of the
                     delicately-penciled brows, that to the close observer betrayed a hidden
                     ferecity of disposition. This man possessed the cruelty of the tiger hidden
                     under the playful softness of the cat.</p>
                  <p>This traveller was an Englishman, one Sir Lasselles Temple.</p>
                  <p>He had had good reason to grow tired of England; and he had left his native
                     land to return once more to the Continent, which he had always preferred.</p>
                  <p>His companion was an escaped galley slave, Gaston Lamorville.</p>
                  <p>This man's society was congenial to Sir Lascelles Temple. The Baronet did not
                     care to have a good man for his companion.</p>
                  <p>Truth, honor, honesty, compassion, benevolence—all those noble qualities which
                     elevate a man's nature, were extinct in the breast of Sir Lascelles Temple. He
                     knew this, and he did not want this companions to be better than himself. He
                     did not want to have to blush before the man whom he chose for his friend, for
                     this reason he clung to Gaston Lamorville. They had shared the burden of their
                     iniquities. They knew each other's guilty secrets. The haughty Baronet,
                     therefore, preferred the society of the ex-galley slave to the companionship of
                     honorable men of his own rank in life.</p>
                  <p>The two men had ridden from Naples this afternoon in the hope that they would
                     reach the house of an Italian nobleman, who was known to Sir Lascelles, before
                     nightfall.</p>
                  <p>This house was about twenty miles from Naples, and was situated in a valley
                     five miles distant from the Vontalini palace.</p>
                  <p>But the travelers had been so foolish as to come without a guide, and they had
                     twice missed the right footpath, and had ridden some miles out of the way.</p>
                  <p>The evening-shadows were now beginning to close in upon them, and the two men
                     looked about them in considerable alarm.</p>
                  <p>"We are going to have a snow-storm," said Gaston Lamorville. "Look at the
                     blackness of the sky yonder. Depend upon it their will be a heavy fall
                     presently, and unless we can find a speedy shelter, we are lost."</p>
                  <p>He was very pale. He was a bad man, and to him the prospect of death was
                     unspeakably terrible; but he was not a coward. He had that desperate courage
                     which is often the attribute of a villain—the fierce daring of a savage animal,
                     rather than the calm fearlessness of a brave man.</p>
                  <p>The two men rode slowly onward through the gathering darkness. They looked
                     right and left with eager eyes that sought to pierce the wintry gloom; but
                     there was no glimmer of a friendly light amid the solemn shadows of the
                     mountainous district.</p>
                  <p>Presently they stopped. It was quite dark now. The night had come down upon
                     them with a fearful rapidity. To go upon a road they knew not was madness. To
                     remain might be fatal, since they must be frozen to death if they lingered long
                     in that desolate region, with the certainty of an approaching snow-storm.</p>
                  <p>"We must wait here," said Gaston Lamorville. "There is only one hope for us. If
                     by any chance some peasant wanders this way, he will serve us as a guide, and
                     conduct us to some place of shelter. If not, our doom is sealed. We have
                     nothing to do but to wait quietly for death."</p>
                  <p>The awful word sounded doubly awful in the stillness of that place. The two men
                     waited. They waited silently: it was no moment for words. They counted the
                     seconds by the beating of their own hearts. The time seemed like eternity. They
                     knew not how long it was, but it appeared to them as if they waited for hours,
                     and yet there was no footstep upon the mountain pathway.</p>
                  <p>As it grew later and later, the one chance of rescue grew more and more
                     hopeless.</p>
                  <p>The simple country people retire early to their humble resting-places. It was
                     scarcely likely, therefore, that any peasant would be wandering on that lonely
                     path way long after sunset.</p>
                  <p>The silvery chime of a distant church-clock told the hour.</p>
                  <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC8328-00000054"/>
                  <p>The two men counted the strokes. It was only eight.</p>
                  <p>"Only eight o'clock!" exclaimed Sir Lascelles Temple. "I should have thought it
                     was midnight."</p>
                  <p>Five minutes after this, the snow began to fall.</p>
                  <p>The soft fleecy flakes—so beautiful to look at, so terrible in the eyes of
                     these two despairing men—fell noiselessly, but fast—terribly fast. The fetlocks
                     of the horses were soon covered by the deepening snow upen the pathway.</p>
                  <p>The night was inky black, and the falling snow made a thick curtain, which
                     surrounded the two watchers, and shut out every object.</p>
                  <p>Still there was no footstep. They would not be able to hear a footfall now upon
                     the thick carpet of snow. They knew this.</p>
                  <p>"We must shout at intervals of two or three minutes," said Gaston Lamorville,
                     "for in this snow-storm a man might pass close to us, and we should neither
                     hear nor see him."</p>
                  <p>At brief intervals the two men shouted aloud, first one and then the other.
                     Their voices echoed through that lonely region; but there was no answer.</p>
                  <p>The snow was gathering, gathering, gathering deeper and deeper about the legs
                     of the horses, when suddenly Gaston Lamorville, who was looking in a different
                     direction from his companion, saw a dim light approaching along the mountain
                     pathway.</p>
                  <p>He could not see the person who carried this light; he could only see the light
                     itself advancing as if by magic.</p>
                  <p>"Shout!" he cried to the Baronet, "there is help at hand."</p>
                  <p>The two men shouted with all their strength. The double cry was long and loud.
                     But the light did not advance any more rapidly.</p>
                  <p>"Brute," muttered Gaston Lamorville; "Can't you hurry yourself when you hear a
                     cry for help!"</p>
                  <p>In five minutes the light came close to the two horsemen. Then, for the first
                     time, they saw that the glimmering radiance came from a rude lantern carried by
                     a man.</p>
                  <p>This man would have passed them if Sir Lascelles Temple had not stretched out
                     his hand and caught him by the shoulder.</p>
                  <p>"We want you to guide us to some shelter?" said the Baronet, in Italian.</p>
                  <p>The man's only answer was a harsh idiotic laugh.</p>
                  <p>He held the lantern above his head, and by its light the two travellers saw
                     that this man was indeed an idiot. His open mouth, his wild vacant-looking
                     eyes, his long elf locks streaming upon his shoulders, all proclaimed that he
                     was some poor mindless wretch to whom the words of other men were sounds that
                     bore no meaning.</p>
                  <p>"Great Heaven!" cried Sir Lascelles Temple. "This man is an idiot. We shall get
                     no help from him."</p>
                  <p>"He must help us,' answered Gaston Lamorville, with determination.</p>
                  <p>At the same time he grasped the idiot's wrist firmly, and looked him full in
                     the face. Then the Frenchman pointed along the mountain pathway, and then,
                     leaning his head upon his hand, closed his eyes, and snored loudly.</p>
                  <p>The idiot laughed, and capered wildly upon the narrow path, flourishing the
                     lantern in his hand. Then he took Gaston Lamorville's horse by the bridle and
                     led it cautiously along the footpath. Sir Lascelles Temple followed.</p>
                  <p>"Come, come," cried the idiot, in the dialect of the neighborhood.</p>
                  <p>His voice, like his laugh, was harsh and guttural.</p>
                  <p>"We are saved!" exclaimed Gaston Lamorville; "this man understands what we
                     want."</p>
                  <p>For some time they traveled slowly onward, the idiot still leading Gaston
                     Lamorville's horse.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the Baronet's heart sank within him, and a child feeling of despair
                     took possession of his breast.</p>
                  <p>Was it not likely that this idiot guide was only leading them astray, deeper
                     and deeper into the remote solitude of the mountains, to lonely places where no
                     human help could come to them—where they must inevitably perish, entombed alive
                     in the snow?</p>
                  <p>The Baronet said as much to Gaston Lamorville; but the Frenchman only laughed
                     at him.</p>
                  <p>"I tell you that the man understands," he said. "I saw a ray of intelligence in
                     his face. Depend upon it he will take us to some place of shelter."</p>
                  <p>Gaston Lamorville was right. At last they saw a red light gleaming across the
                     snow-covered pathway from the windows of a miserable-looking house.</p>
                  <p>This house was an inn.</p>
                  <p>The idiot knocked at the door. A woman opened it, and a rough-looking man
                     appeared directly afterward upon the threshold.</p>
                  <p>"Can we have a night's shelter for ourselves and our horses?" asked Sir
                     Lascelles Temple, in Italian.</p>
                  <p>The woman hesitated.</p>
                  <p>"We can shelter the horses, noble Signor," she said; "my husband will make them
                     comfortable in the stable, though it is but a rough one. But we have only one
                     public room: I doubt if such gentlemen as you would care to sleep in it."</p>
                  <p>"We are not very fastidious, my good woman," said Gaston Lamorville, "for we
                     have narrowly escaped sleeping in a very comfortable bed of snow, from which it
                     is doubtful if we should ever have risen. We will occupy your room and pay you
                     well for it. And we shall be glad of any supper you can provide for us."</p>
                  <p>The two travelers dismounted, and went into the house. Their limbs were stiff
                     with the cold, and they walked straight to the open hearth, upon which a great
                     pile of pine logs burned cheerily.</p>
                  <p>The idiot was there before them. He was sitting on a low wooden stool close to
                     the hearth, and was warming his long thin fingers over the blaze.</p>
                  <p>The travelers saw that he was a tall man, slender, but well built, only his
                     figure was distorted by a settled stoop—his head was stretched forward upon his
                     chest.</p>
                  <p>He had a long black beard and rough-looking raven locks. He was clothed in rags
                     so wretched, that it was almost a marvel that they could be kept together.</p>
                  <p>The woman of the house approached the idiot, tapped him sharply on the
                     shoulder, and pointed to the door.</p>
                  <p>"Go!" she said, in the dialect of the district; "go!"</p>
                  <p>The idiot frowned, shook his head, and crouched lower over the fire.</p>
                  <p>"Let him stay?" said Gaston Lamorville; "we shall want him to guide us away
                     from this place in the morning."</p>
                  <p>"But there is no other room than this for your accommodation, noble Signor,"
                     said the woman.</p>
                  <p>"And it's scarcely likely we are going to have an idiot keeping us company all
                     the night long!" exclaimed Sir Lascelles Temple; "we shall get a better guide
                     in the morning, I should hope. Turn the fellow out!"</p>
                  <p>"My husband will be in directly, Signor; he will send the idiot away."</p>
                  <p>"Who is the man? and to whom does he belong?" asked Gaston Lamorville.</p>
                  <p>"He belongs to no one; and no one knows who he is, Signor," replied the woman.
                     "He has been about these parts, off and on, for the last three years or so;
                     nobody knows his name; but they call him the Idiot of the Mountain. A little
                     time ago he disappeared, and was missing for several months. People thought
                     that he had been murdered, or had fallen into one of the ravines; but within
                     the last month he has appeared again just the same as ever."</p>
                  <p>The landlord of the house re-entered at this moment. He was a stalwart-looking
                     fellow. His wife whispered something to him. The man nodded, and went up to the
                     idiot, who was still cowering over the fire, took him roughly by the shoulders,
                     and half dragged half pushed him out of the room, and out of the house.</p>
                  <p>The idiot made no resistance—he only laughed a hoarse idiotic laugh.</p>
                  <p>The door closed upon him, and shut him out into the bitter night.</p>
                  <p>He had saved the lives of Sir Lascelles Temple and Gaston Lamorville, but
                     neither of them bestowed so much as a thought upon the poor shivering wretch,
                     who was turned out of that warm shelter, perhaps to perish amongst the snow.
                     What was his fate to them? They were comfortable. The place was rough and
                     poorly furnished; but there was warmth and food.</p>
                  <p>The travelers drew their chairs close to the hearth, threw off their wet
                     cloaks, and delivered them to the woman of the house to be dried ready for the
                     next morning. Then they stretched out their legs before the blazing wood fire,
                     took out their cigarcases, and lighted their cigars.</p>
                  <p>The woman bustled about and brought some bread and cheese, a couple bottles of
                     wine, some plates, knives, and drinking-horns. She arranged these upon a little
                     table near the fire.</p>
                  <p>Then she brought some blankets, and spread them upon a couple of rough wooden
                     couches which were placed in recesses upon either side of the fireplace.</p>
                  <p>"You will find the wine good, Signers," she said; "and I hope you will sleep
                     well, though the beds are rough for such gentlemen as you. If there is nothing
                     more wanted, my husband and I will go to bed at once, with your leave, for we
                     are obliged to rise very early in the morning."</p>
                  <p>"By all means, my good woman," replied Gaston Lamorville. "I suppose you have
                     brought us the best you have in the house? If so, you can do nothing more for
                     us, and we wish you good night."</p>
                  <p>"Good night, noble Signor."</p>
                  <p>The woman curtsied and left the room, closing the door behind her. Sir
                     Lascelles Temple got up and walked to the window. The casement was small and
                     square. It consisted of only two panes of glass, and one of these panes was
                     broken almost entirely away. But the window was sheltered by a thick curtain of
                     serge.</p>
                  <p>The Baronet lifted this serge curtain, and looked out; but there was nothing to
                     be seen except the snow; which was still falling, falling, falling.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE NIGHT-ATTACK.</head>
                  <p>The two men drew the table close to the fire, and began their supper. They only
                     ate a few mouthfuls of the bread and cheese; but they drank a great deal of the
                     wine, which was very good.</p>
                  <p>They had by this time somewhat recovered from the fatigue of their journey, and
                     from the terrible anguish of despair which they had suffered so lately. They
                     were now able to converse at their ease.</p>
                  <p>"This delay is most unlucky," said Sir Lascelles Temple. "I has a special
                     reason for wanting to get away from Naples without an hour's loss of time, and
                     without leaving any trace by which I might be followed."</p>
                  <p>"And that special reason you refused to reveal to your faithful friend and
                     companion, Gaston Lamorville," said the Frenchman, with a mocking accent.</p>
                  <p>"I refused to reveal it because—"</p>
                  <p>The Baronet hesitated, and did not finish his sentence.</p>
                  <p>"Because it is a reason that you are ashamed of, eh, Sir Lascelles?"</p>
                  <p>"No, Lamorville; but because it concerns another."</p>
                  <p>"What other?"</p>
                  <p>"A woman."</p>
                  <p>"Humph!" exclaimed the Frenchman. "I might have guessed as much."</p>
                  <p>"To-morrow." said the Baronet, "a woman will arrive in Naples who, for the last
                     fifteen years, has followed me from one part of Europe to another. Were I to
                     hide myself in the furthermost wilds of the Australian bush, I believe that
                     this woman would track my path, and follow me even thither. Yet for fifteen
                     years I have eluded her. Upon the day on which she has arrived in each city I
                     have quitted that city by stealth, and leaving no trace of my footsteps behind
                     me. She has followed me to Vienna, to Munich, to Constantinople, to Berlin, to
                     Venice, to Florence, to Paris, to London, to the highlands of Scotland, to the
                     Lake of Killarney; but without avail. During those fifteen years we have never
                     met face to face."</p>
                  <p>"Why do you avoid her?" asked Gaston Lamorville.</p>
                  <p>The Baronet was silent for some moments. His head was bent, and his handsome
                     blue eyes were fixed upon the burning wood scattered on the broad hearth.</p>
                  <p>"Why do I avoid her?" he said, with his eyes still fixed upon the blazing wood.
                     "I avoid her because she has sworn that, whenever we do meet, she will kill
                     me."</p>
                  <p>"Why?"</p>
                  <p>"Because, fifteen years ago, I killed in a duel the man whom she loved."</p>
                  <p>"But you killed him fairly, I suppose?" said the Frenchman, fixing a piercing
                     glance upon the thoughtful face of his companion.</p>
                  <p>"She says that there was foul play," answered Sir Lascelles Temple, moodily.
                     "She says that I fired before the signal was given."</p>
                  <p>"Was she there to see?"</p>
                  <p>"She was. She stood by in the snow, in the gray dawn of a January morning, with
                     her balldress trailing upon the damp ground, and her diamonds glittering in the
                     dim light. She stood there, and saw her lover fall. She knelt by his side, and
                     tried to stem the current of his life-blood with a fragile rag of costly lace.
                     Great Heaven, why do I recall that picture? It is before me now. I can see the
                     corpse upon the blood-stained ground, and that woman in all her beauty and her
                     anguish."</p>
                  <p>The Baronet covered his face with his outstretched hands, as if he would have
                     shut out some horrible sight. His whole frame was shaken by a convulsive
                     shudder.</p>
                  <p>"This enemy of yours must be a strange woman," said Gaston Lamorville.</p>
                  <p>"She is a strange woman."</p>
                  <p>"And you fear her?" said the Frenchman, with a scornful emphasis upon the word
                     fear.</p>
                  <p>"I do," answered Sir Lascelles Temple, "for she has sworn that she will kill
                     me; and I sometimes fancy that, sooner or later, she will keep her word."</p>
                  <p>"Humph!" muttered Gaston Lamorville. "I did not think it was in you to fear a
                     woman."</p>
                  <p>"It is because my enemy is a woman that I fear her. A man's attack may be
                     guarded against—not a woman's. She strikes in the dark. You can never know from
                     what quarter the blow may come. Hers is the brain that plots the mischiet; but
                     a stranger's hand may strike the blow. She may be a thousand miles away from
                     her victim when the deed of vengeance is accomplished. She will move all the
                     powers of hell to help her direful purpose; but she can smile in your face all
                     the time, and tell you that you are forgiven. Upon the day of her lover's death
                     this woman knelt in the snow, and swore that she would kill me with<pb
                        n="10-11" xml:id="VAC8328-00000055"/> her own white hand. A fortnight
                     afterward she wrote to me, and told me that I was forgiven. She had always
                     preferred me to the dead man; and when she had pretended to love him, it was
                     because of her jealous anger against me. She implored me to come and see her.
                     She was lonely and miserable. A friendly word from me would comfort her."</p>
                  <p>"And did you trust her?"</p>
                  <p>"Trust her? No!" cried Sir Lascelles Temple. "That letter was a trap. A coxcomb
                     might have caught at the bait, perhaps, and might have gone blindly to his
                     doom. I was too wise for that. Since that day I have received a hundred such
                     letters—eloquent, passionate, full of tender words that might melt the hardest
                     heart. But I have never replied to one of them. I know the woman!"</p>
                  <p>"She is rich and powerful?" I presume.</p>
                  <p>"Yes; she is enormously rich, and she is of high rank."</p>
                  <p>"Is she an Englishwoman?"</p>
                  <p>"No; she is a Russian."</p>
                  <p>"Aha!" cried Gaston Lamorville; "I understand all now. These Russian women are
                     dangerous. In outward seeming they are as cold as ice; but the fire rages
                     beneath the snow. Ha!" cried the Frenchman, suddenly; "Look yonder!"</p>
                  <p>He pointed to the serge curtain that shrouded the window behind the Baronet.
                     Sir Lascelles turned quickly—but there was nothing to be seen.</p>
                  <p>"What the deuce is the matter with you, Lamorville?" he demanded,
                     impatiently.</p>
                  <p>"I fancied I saw a face looking in at the window," the Frenchman answered.</p>
                  <p>"Pshaw! Who should be out on such a night as this?"</p>
                  <p>"I don't know; but I could have sworn I saw some one."</p>
                  <p>The two men went to the window and looked out—but there was no one to be
                     seen.</p>
                  <p>"You have been taking too much of that wine, my friend," said the Baronet.</p>
                  <p>"I don't know that. I am sober enough; but I may have been mistaken,
                     nevertheless. I hope it is so, and that no one has been playing the spy upon
                     us. I suppose the people of this house are honest."</p>
                  <p>"Egad, I should hope so," exclaimed Sir Lascelles; "it would be a sorry
                     look-out for me if they were not, since I have brought every sixpence that I
                     had at Naples with me, in gold and notes."</p>
                  <p>"And I too have the best part of my worldly wealth about me. I obeyed your
                     orders; packed up everything I had; sent it off to Marseilles by the steamer;
                     took my money out of the bank, and equipped myself for a journey on
                     horseback."</p>
                  <p>"Precisely," answered the Baronet; "and now you know my reasons for asking you
                     to join me in this abrupt departure. By leaving Naples suddenly and on
                     horseback, we throw dust in the eyes of that woman. She will never be able to
                     track us."</p>
                  <p>"She will be very clever if she does track us," said the ex-galley slave, with
                     a laugh. If you trust yourself to my guidance, you may give her the slip most
                     completely. I've been used to that sort of thing; and I think I know how to
                     escape from a pursuer."</p>
                  <p>Gaston Lamorville was thinking of his numerous escapes from prison—wonderful
                     escapes, which had won for him the nickname of "Gaston the Eel."</p>
                  <p>"I'm getting sleepy," said the Baronet, presently. "I'll take another glass of
                     that wine, see to my pistols, and then settle myself for the night."</p>
                  <p>"And I shall follow your example."</p>
                  <p>Each of the travelers was provided with a pair of pistols, placed in a stout
                     leathern belt worn under the waistcoat.</p>
                  <p>They took out the weapons, examined the loading, and replaced them.</p>
                  <p>Neither of them happened to look up at the window during this operation.</p>
                  <p>Had either of the travelers glanced in that direction, he must have seen a pale
                     face lit up by a pair of gleaming black eyes looking in under the serge
                     curtain.</p>
                  <p>It was the face of Oscar Bertrand, the Idiot of the Mountain.</p>
                  <p>But it was only for the space of a few moments that the face appeared. Then the
                     curtain dropped, and all was still.</p>
                  <p>The two travelers stretched themselves at full length upon their narrow
                     couches; they wrapped themselves in the blankets provided for them, and very
                     quickly fell asleep.</p>
                  <p>Again the face appeared at the window. This time the watcher's head was pushed
                     into the room, and the black eyes rested alternately upon the faces of the two
                     sleepers.</p>
                  <p>There was nothing idiotic now in the glance of those restless black eyes.</p>
                  <p>For a quarter of an hour the watched kept his post; then he left the window,
                     after having pushed the casement open, and might have been heard, in the
                     stillness without, to whistle softly—once—twice—three times.</p>
                  <p>Then a man's head, wearing a tight black skull cap and a black mask, appeared
                     in the open window. In the next minute he had slid through the aperture, which
                     was only just wide enough to admit his body, and dropped into the room.</p>
                  <p>He was dressed completely in black, in strangely-cut clothes that fitted him
                     tightly, like the costume of an acrobat or a harlequin.</p>
                  <p>In this strange-looking dress there was nothing to impede his movements. He
                     could slide through narrow openings—he had no loose garments to be caught by
                     nails, or impaled upon unknown hooks.</p>
                  <p>Five other men, also wearing black masks and clad in every particular like the
                     first, dropped into the room. In the dim light of the dying wood-fire these six
                     men looked like so many demons, or like the impish shadows seen in a troubled
                     sleep.</p>
                  <p>Their footsteps were as noiseless as if they had indeed been shadows, for their
                     shoes were of felt, and made no sound upon the stone floor of the chamber.</p>
                  <p>Three of them approached the bed upon which the Baronet lay. The other three
                     went to that occupied by Gaston Lamorville.</p>
                  <p>With fingers that were almost as light in their touch as the fingers of a
                     fairy, the black masks felt here and there for the money belonging to the two
                     sleepers.</p>
                  <p>The Baronet's pocket-book was in his breast. That was easily taken.</p>
                  <p>The lightness of the hands did everything; but in case of the worst, a man
                     stood by each of the beds with a loaded pistol pointed to the forehead of the
                     sleeper.</p>
                  <p>A word, a cry, and the pistols would have been fired.</p>
                  <p>Gaston Lamorville, more cautious than the Baronet, lay upon his side, with his
                     right-hand firmly clenched upon the canvas bag containing his money.</p>
                  <p>One of the black-masks drew a feather from his pocket, and, with the extreme
                     point of it, lightly touched the Frenchman's nose.</p>
                  <p>Gaston Lamorville put up his right-hand to scratch his nose. In that moment the
                     canvas bag was removed, and a loaf, snatched from the table and wrapped in a
                     napkin, was substituted in its place.</p>
                  <p>The Frenchman's hand fell once more by his side; it dropped upon the lump of
                     bread in the napkin; the sleeper's fingers closed upon the substitute for the
                     bag of money, and even in his sleep he gave a eeble grunt of satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>The travelers were next relieved of their watches, chains, shirt-studs, jeweled
                     pins, etc.</p>
                  <p>Then the six black masks crept out of the window, stealthily, noiselessly as
                     they had crept in.</p>
                  <p>But before this, one of them took a square of paper from his pocket, and
                     transfixed it upon the table with one of the knives that had been laid for the
                     travelers' supper.</p>
                  <p>The two companions slept well. They had drunk deeply of the luscious Neapolitan
                     wine, and it had had a stupefying effect upon both of them.</p>
                  <p>The winter sunlight was streaming into the room through the crevices of the
                     serge curtain when the sleepers at last awoke.</p>
                  <p>The Baronet had locked the door of the chamber before going to bed; and not
                     satisfied with this, had placed a couple of heavy chairs, so that it would have
                     been impossible for anybody to enter the room without knocking them down.</p>
                  <p>Sir Lascelles Temple's first look was directed to these chairs.</p>
                  <p>They were undisturbed.</p>
                  <p>"Thank goodness!" he exclaimed; "the people of the house are honest."</p>
                  <p>But in the next minute he felt in his breast. The pocket-book was gone.</p>
                  <p>He uttered a cry of mingled rage and horror; and then, with sudden eagerness,
                     began to search amongst the folds of the blanket.</p>
                  <p>But there was no vestige of the pocket-book.</p>
                  <p>At the same moment, Gaston Lamorville discovered that the object upon which his
                     hand had fondly rested throughout his slumbers was nothing better than a stale
                     loaf of black bread wrapped in a coarse linen cloth.</p>
                  <p>"Robbed!" he cried, with a horrible oath; "robbed of three thousand five
                     hundred and forty-seven pounds in notes and gold!"</p>
                  <p>"Mine was nearly double that," returned the Baronet. "But this is
                     magic—withcraft. No one has entered by that door, and it is next to impossible
                     that any one could get in by yonder window."</p>
                  <p>"Bah!" exclaimed the ex-galley slave, contemptuously, "that's all you know
                     about it. I'm not a small man; but I'll pledge myself to get through a narrower
                     window than that. We have been robbed, tricked, duped; but by whom? Ah!"</p>
                  <p>The Frenchman's eye caught the square of paper fastened to the rough pinewood
                     table.</p>
                  <p>He took out the knife, and examined the document.</p>
                  <p>"English!" he exclaimed. "English thieves here among these mountains. English
                     thieves clever enough to rob sleepers who keep loaded pistols under their
                     pillows, and sleep with their hands upon their money."</p>
                  <p>"Read!" cried the Baronet, impatiently, pointing to the paper as he spoke.</p>
                  <p>The Frenchman read the following words, which were written in a clear bold hand
                     upon the square sheet of paper:</p>
                  <q>

                              <p>"You have been plundered by those who know their work, as you
                                 yourselves can testify.</p>
                              <p>"You are both of you remarkably clever men; but you are not the
                                 only clever people in the world.</p>
                              <p>"If you regret the money you have lost, and wish to gain three
                                 times the sum that has been taken from you, come to the gardens of
                                 the Vontalini palace at twilight to-morrow. Follow the light of the
                                 lantern; and if you come to trust, come without fear.</p>
                              <p>"Do not come to betray, unless you are tired of life. Those whom
                                 you will meet are strong; and they can be desperate.</p>
                              <p>"Come—or pass upon your way. Do not attempt retaliation. Those who
                                 robbed you to-night are stronger than justice, and more subtle than
                                 the law.</p>

                  <p>The Frenchman turned the paper over and over in his hand. His heavy black brows
                     were contracted; his teeth clenched upon his under-lip.</p>
                  <p>"This is written by the chief of a society of thieves," he said. "There is only
                     one man in the world whom I should have thought capable of writing such a
                     letter as this."</p>
                  <p>"And what is the name of that man?"</p>
                  <p>"I cannot tell you. He had many names. He did the deeds of a hundred men. He
                     was in Italy one day, in England on the next, as it seemed to those who tried
                     to follow him. He laughed at justice, and boasted that throughout a life of
                     crime he had never crossed the threshold of a prison. A little more than three
                     years ago he disappeared, and has never been heard of since.</p>
                  <p>"And you think this is written by him?"</p>
                  <p>"If he is alive, yes."</p>
                  <p>"We will see that to-morrow-night."</p>
                  <p>"You will obey his summons then?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes," answered the Baronet. "If this man is great and successful, I should
                     like to know him."</p>
                  <p>"Even if he is the chief of a band of thieves?" said Gaston Lamorville, with a
                     sneer.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," answered the Baronet. "You have reason to know that I am not fastidious
                     as to the character of my associates."</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE MEETING IN THE GROTTO.</head>
                  <p>The spacious gardens surrounding the Vontalini palace had once been as
                     beautiful as they were spacious. Lovely women had wandered in the shadowy
                     arcades, or loitered by the sculptured margin of a marble fountain. Men of high
                     rank and princely fortune had strolled arm in arm along the grassy terraces,
                     where the statues gleamed whitely in the sunlight. There had been love and
                     music, laughter and delight, in the orange-groves, the bowery-glades, beside
                     the rippling waters of the spreading lake. Myriad lamps had glimmered brightly
                     amongst the dark-green foliage. Midnight-festivals had been held under the
                     purple summer-sky. Wealth had been lavished by a princely hand—until a dark day
                     came, a dreadful deed was done, and the master of the house fled from the
                     threshold.</p>
                  <p>"I leave it as a shelter for the demons," he said, wildly, to some one who
                     entreated him to remain. "It is a fitting dwelling-place for them; but it is
                     unfit for any Christian occupant."</p>
                  <p>For a long time ruin and desolation had reigned at the Vontalini palace. It had
                     been for some years entirely unoccupied, save by the bats and owls, the spiders
                     and rats. Then it had been taken by the French student, Leon Maretti, at an
                     almost nominal rent.</p>
                  <p>But within the past six weeks all had been changed. Crowds of workmen had then
                     gathered together at the palace, and the task of renovation was very nearly
                     completed. Money was spent upon this work with a lavish hand. Architects,
                     builders, and decorators were employed in the work. Elegant furniture,
                     pictures, statues, marble and alabaster, vases, cameos, and bronzes were
                     collected from every city in Italy. Cases of valuable goods arrived from Paris.
                     A king could not have done things in better style, or with more reckless
                     disregard for cost.</p>
                  <p>But all this time no one knew the name of the magician who was working this
                     wondrous transformation. People knew that it could not be Leon<pb n="12-13"
                        xml:id="VAC8328-00000056"/> Maretti; for it was well known that he had
                     wasted his life in the pursuit of science, and that he had only enough money
                     for his own simple requirements.</p>
                  <p>By-the-by, it was rumored that a kinsman, a wealthy English nobleman, had come
                     to share the retreat of the Frenchman.</p>
                  <p>In vain the inquisitive inhabitants of the neighborhood endeavored to get a
                     glimpse of the English nobleman. He had never yet appeared.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes, in the dusky twilight, a man wrapped in a long horseman's cloak had
                     been seen to ride away from the gates of the Vontalini palace, but no one knew
                     whether this man was really the English Lord. It was scarcely likely that such
                     a grandee would go out at night thus roughly clad and unattended.</p>
                  <p>The gossips of the neighborhood could scarcely talk of anything but the
                     Vontalini palace and its mysterious inmate.</p>
                  <p>Toward midnight upon the 24th of February, Sir Lascelles Temple and his
                     companion approached he great iron gates before the Vontalini palace.</p>
                  <p>All was dark; no ray of light glimmered in any of the long range of windows in
                     the front of the mansion. The gates were ajar. Gaston Lamorville and the
                     Baronet entered the broad avenue. They had received no direction as to which
                     way they should go, and they paused, half doubtful whither to turn.</p>
                  <p>"There is no light either in the house or the grounds!" exclaimed Sir Lascelles
                     Temple. "We have been fooled!"</p>
                  <p>"Wait," answered the ex-galley slave. "If the writer of that letter is the man
                     I take him to be, there is no folly in the business. He is not a man to
                     jest."</p>
                  <p>The two men waited until the distant clocks sounded the first stroke of twelve.
                     They counted the strokes of the clock breathlessly. As the last chime died away
                     upon the silence, a light, brilliant, vivid, almost supernatural in appearance,
                     shone out of the dark shadows amidst the cypress-trees.</p>
                  <p>The light was of the blue radiance we see in the stars.</p>
                  <p>"It looks like a falling star," said Gaston Lamorville. "We are to follow
                     it.</p>
                  <p>He walked in the direction of the light, followed by the Baronet. They reached
                     a grove of cypress trees, in the midst of which there was a circle of smooth
                     turf. In the centre of this circle of turf there was a kind of vault of
                     sculptured marble, surmounted by an urn of bronze. The door of this vault was
                     open, and the brilliant star-like radiance came from within.</p>
                  <p>As the two men approached the doorway of the vault, a deep and sonorous voice
                     cried in English, "Enter! and enter without fear."</p>
                  <p>Inside the vault there was a wide marble stair case leading downward, as if
                     into the solid earth. Sir Lascelles Temple and Gaston Lamorville descended this
                     staircase. There were about forty steps; and at the bottom of the staircase
                     there was a bronze door, with an exquisitely-sculptured knocker representing a
                     dragon's head with fiery ruby eyes. The ex-galley slave lifted this knocker and
                     knocked loudly. The door was opened by a spring, and the two men walked into a
                     carpeted passage. Then for the first time they saw that they had bean followed
                     by a man dressed entirely in black, and wearing a black velvet mask and
                     skull-cap.</p>
                  <p>"You tell us to trust you," said Gaston Lamorville to this man; "but you do not
                     trust us. We have been watched since the moment of our entering these
                     grounds."</p>
                  <p>"You have," answered the mask. "It is necessary to guard against possible
                     treachery. You might not have come alone. We will trust you when you belong to
                     us; until then we watch you."</p>
                  <p>At the end of the carpeted passage there was a large circular room, plainly
                     furnished, but hung with ruby curtains of the richest cloth, which fell in
                     voluminous folds all round the apartment.</p>
                  <p>About twenty men dressed in black, and masked, were seated in black
                     morocco-covered chairs round this room. Each man wore upon his breast a number
                     embroidered in white silk upon a square of black velvet.</p>
                  <p>At one side of the room a man, who was evidenly the president of the assembly,
                     sat in a large arm-chair, covered with black morocco and studded with
                     steel-headed nails. Before him there was a small table, such as is usually seen
                     in a lawyer's office. Immediately behind him, and within reach of his hands,
                     were the ruby cloth-curtains that shrouded the walls.</p>
                  <p>Upon the table there were two lamps, made with reflectors of a peculiar
                     construction, and of shining metal that resembled polished silver. By the aid
                     of these metallic reflectors the man seated at the table could turn the full
                     and dazzling light of the lamp in any direction with one touch of his hand.</p>
                  <p>This President was dressed in black, like the men assembled round him; but his
                     dress was made entirely of the richest Genoa velvet, and he wore no number upon
                     his breast. Instead of that badge he wore a small star of diamonds—diamonds of
                     large size and of the finest water.</p>
                  <p>"Be seated, gentlemen," he said courteously, pointing to two empty chairs.</p>
                  <p>Sir Lascelles and his companion seated themselves. The masked President turned
                     the full light of the lamp on his left upon the face of the Baronet. The light
                     of the lamp on his right he turned upon the face of the ex-galley slave. By
                     this means he could see every change in the countenances of the two men.</p>
                  <p>"No, gentlemen," he said, "you have been victimized by some friends of mine,
                     and you have been the losers by last night's adventure. I wish that we should
                     very clearly understand each other. And to begin, I think it as well to let you
                     understand that I know you."</p>
                  <p>The masked president opened a morocco-covered volume that lay before him.</p>
                  <p>"I am in the habit of making a few private notes upon the subject of the
                     histories of my different friends," he said. "I find such information sometimes
                     extremely interesting. I often find it very useful. Sir Lascelles Temple;
                     Monsieur Lamorville."</p>
                  <p>Each of the men started as his name was mentioned. They had not expected that
                     they would have been known.</p>
                  <p>"I have made a few memoranda here respecting each of you," continued the
                     President; "but I need not read more than a word or two. Among the notes set
                     against your name, Sir Lascelles, I find the names of three women—Susan Floy;
                     an old woman known as Mother Magson, and the Princess Fedora."</p>
                  <p>Sir Lascelles temple turned as white as death. He saw that he was indeed
                     known.</p>
                  <p>"The girl called Susan Floy disappeared some years ago—rather mysteriously, I
                     behave," said the president, significantly. "I merely mention these trifles in
                     order to convince you that you are no stranger to me, my dear Sir
                     Lascelles."</p>
                  <p>The Baronet could see the gleaming eyes of the president shining through the
                     holes in the black velvet mask, and he could see that those eyes were fixed
                     upon him. He was not able to preserve an appearance of calmness beneath that
                     steady and burning gaze.</p>
                  <p>"How—how did you know this?" he gasped.</p>
                  <p>"No matter how I came to know it," answered the President. "It is enough for
                     you that I do know it, and that I will never make any bad use of my knowledge
                     so long as you serve me and mine. You are a very clever man, my dear Sir
                     Lascelles, but we are a very powerful association. With us, knowledge of the
                     world is power. We want clever men. We have wanted you for a long time. When we
                     want a man, we watch him. You have been watched. A web is woven round you,
                     whose strength you will never know unless you strive to extricate yourself from
                     it. As a friend, I recommend you not to do that. We have watched you. There is
                     scarcely a page in the history of your life that is not as familiar to me as it
                     is to yourself. You are as much one of us as if you had already taken the oaths
                     of our order."</p>
                  <p>"What is your order?" asked Sir Lascelles Temple. "I do not understand—"</p>
                  <p>"But your friend does understand," returned the masked President, looking full
                     at the ex-galley slave. "Gaston the Eel must have heard of the Black Band
                     before to-night."</p>
                  <p>"I have," answered Gaston Lamorville; "I have heard of you, and have wished to
                     join your order. But I have waited the mysterious summons. I am ready to take
                     the oath."</p>
                  <p>"Good," replied the President. "And you, Sir Lascelles?"</p>
                  <p>"I, too, am ready," answered the Baronet, promptly.</p>
                  <p>"Executioners of Order, advance!" cried the President.</p>
                  <p>He parted the curtains behind him as he spoke. Two men, each carrying a long
                     and slender dagger in his belt, came from behind the curtains, and advanced
                     into the centre of the apartment.</p>
                  <p>"Gentlemen," said the President, "the world is made up of two species of
                     animals—tigers and sheep. The sheep are very good, very praiseworthy, very
                     honest; but they are also very stupid, and the tigers eat them. Gentlemen, my
                     idea is that it is better to be tigers than to be sheep. It is better to eat
                     than to be eaten. We are tigers. We are a band of men, united by a solemn and a
                     a fearful oath, chosen from every class of society, from the prince to the
                     ticket-of-leave man, gathered together from every quarter of the globe—from
                     England to the furthest wilds of India. Our purpose is gain; we have no object
                     but to be rich. And we are rich; but we are extravagant fellows every one of
                     us, and it is necessary that our wealth should increase. We are strong, because
                     we are numerous; we are still stronger, because we are united. We help and
                     protect each other, and we defy all the laws ever made upon this earth. Are you
                     prepared to join us?"</p>
                  <p>"We are."</p>
                  <p>"Good."</p>
                  <p>The oath of the Order of the Black Band was then administered. The men with the
                     numbers on their breasts advanced slowly one by one, and every man clasped the
                     hands of the two new members.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE PRINCESS FEDORA.</head>
                  <p>One of the most elegant houses in the neighborhood of Naples had been slowly
                     fitted up for the occupation of the wealthy Russian lady, the Princess
                     Fedora.</p>
                  <p>The house stood upon a hill overlooking the purple waters of the bay. The white
                     walls were sheltered by groves of orange and myrtle, olive and lemon. The house
                     was not large. It was a fairy mansion, fit for the earthly residence of a fairy
                     queen.</p>
                  <p>The woman who had newly taken possession of this delicious little mansion might
                     have been well mistaken for the Queen of the Fairies. And yet she was not
                     young. To the eyes of some people she was not even beautiful. She was only
                     exquisitely fascinating—most divinely bewitching. To be in her presence was to
                     be intoxicated—to be overwhelmed by some mysterious influence that was as
                     powerful as the influence of strong wine.</p>
                  <p>If the Princess Fedora was not a lovely woman, she was certainly a most
                     dangerous one. She was small, slight, and very fair. Her skin was like the
                     newly-fallen snow, except, indeed, that it had the transparency of alabaster.
                     There was no vestige of color in her face, except when she was angry. Then two
                     spots of the brightest and loveliest rose-color suddenly illumined her face,
                     glowing in the centre of each rounded cheek. People who knew her well said that
                     her anger was more dangerous than the rage of a hungry tiger; but those who
                     were only slightly acquainted with her believed that her passion was only the
                     pretty playfulness of a spoiled child. People who offended her deeply rarely
                     knew the extent of her anger. She said little, and even that little in a voice
                     that was soft and harmonious as the most exquisite music. But those who
                     offended her felt the consequences of her anger afterward, when they were far
                     away from her. Her enemies were very seldom longlived.</p>
                  <p>Her face was not beautiful, but it attracted the eye far more than the most
                     lovely faces. Her features were very small and delicate; but her dark blue eyes
                     were like two sapphires of the deepest hue. Sometimes their light was softened
                     by a dewy shadow; then they seemed like violets in the early morning. At other
                     times they blazed like purple jewels, and lighted up her snow-pale ace with an
                     almost supernatural brightness.</p>
                  <p>The Princess Fedora was rich—very rich. None knew the extent of her wealth.
                     People only knew that her riches seemed inexhaustible, and that she scattered
                     money right and left, gratifying every caprice, however wild in its
                     extravagance. A queen could not have done more than this. The Princess was
                     generous to those who served her; implacable against those who injured her.
                     Dark stories had been told of her early youth, and of her married life. She was
                     a widow. Her husband had died in Russia eighteen years before this time. She
                     was exactly nine-and-thirty years of age; but in appearance she was as girlish
                     as if she had been only seventeen. No one knew by what secret she preserved her
                     youth; but she did preserve it. Her forehead was as smooth as polished ivory;
                     her rosy lips as fresh and dewy as the lips of a slumbering infant.</p>
                  <p>She was half sitting, half reclining, in a low easy-chair before a wood fire in
                     her boudoir, upon the day after the midnight-scene in the grotto beneath. She
                     had risen late, and had only just emerged from her luxurious bedroom, which
                     communicated with the boudoir.</p>
                  <p>The door of the bedroom was half open, and the low Arabian bedstead, with its
                     gilded framework and violet-satin curtains, was visible through the
                     opening.</p>
                  <p>The Princess was wrapped in a loose dressing-gown of dark-blue velvet, lined
                     with white satin. The glowing purple of the velvet contrasted exquisitely with
                     the alabaster tint of the Princess Fedora's complexion. Her tiny feet—slender
                     and arched as the feet of an Arab chief—were covered with white silk stockings,
                     embroidered with golden stars, and the toes were hidden in pointed slippers of
                     scarlet morocco.</p>
                  <p>She was nestling close to the fire, and every now and then she bent down and
                     spread her little white hands over the red blaze of the wood.</p>
                  <p>The diamonds upon her slender fingers scintillated in the glowing light, and
                     all the colors of the<pb n="14" xml:id="VAC8328-00000057"/> rainbow seemed to
                     glimmer upon the priceless gems.</p>
                  <p>The boudoir of the Princess was a little nest of luxury and beauty. Pictures of
                     almost fabulous value appeared here and there amidst the silken draperies upon
                     the walls. Oval mirrors, in frames of Sevres china, reflected the elegance of
                     the apartment. Vases and statuettes, jeweled drinking-cups, costly toys of
                     every species, glimmered and glittered behind the glass doors of a buhl
                     cabinet. The floor was covered with a crimson carpet of velvet pile; the
                     hearthrug was ermine; the fender exquisitely-chiseled bronze and ormolu. The
                     chair-cushions, the down pillows amidst which the Princess Fedora nestled, were
                     all covered with the richest watered-silk of a pale cream-color, edged with
                     deep fringes of gold.</p>
                  <p>The rest of the house resembled the boudoir in its magnificence. Nearly twenty
                     servants had come to Naples in attendance upon the Princess. She paid her cook
                     a salary of five hundred pounds a year. Her stable was occupied by half a dozen
                     horses that had cost from two to four hundred pounds a piece.</p>
                  <p>And yet this woman was miserable.</p>
                  <p>The man whom the Princess loved had been murdered. He fell in a duel; but the
                     Princess Fedora called his death a murder. From that hour she had lived only
                     for revenge.</p>
                  <p>She was rich and powerful; but in spite of her wealth and power, the murderer
                     of her lover had defied her. Night and day she thought of this. To the world
                     she seemed only a charming woman—careless, happy, with no object in life except
                     her own enjoyment.</p>
                  <p>"How long am I to wait?" she cried aloud sometimes in the solitude of her
                     luxurious chamber; "how long am I to wait for the day of vengeance?"</p>
                  <p>She was not long alone to-day. While she was sipping some chocolate out of a
                     fragile cup of Dresden china, the door was opened, and a servant announced "Mr.
                     Barrington".</p>
                  <p>"Let him come in," replied the Princess, carelessly.</p>
                  <p>A very elegant-looking man, with light flaxen hair, mustache, and beard, but
                     with piercing black eyes, entered the boudoir.</p>
                  <p>"Good-morning, my dear Fedora," he said, when the servant had retired.</p>
                  <p>"Good-morning, Oscar."</p>
                  <p>The man with the flaxen hair and beard was the Grand Master of the Black Band.
                     His disguise was perfect. He could do almost everything except change the color
                     of his eyes. The flaxen hair and beard entirely altered the character of his
                     countenance. He looked an elegant but rather stupid man of fashion. He chose to
                     call himself Barrington, and he represented himself to be an English gentleman,
                     possessed of a large fortune. He did not fear recognition. Those who had known
                     him as the Idiot of the Mountain were not likely to recognize him under his
                     present disguise. At any moment he could appear upon the mountain-pathway a
                     miserable-looking imbecile whom no one feared or suspected.</p>
                  <p>Oscar Bertrand seated himself in an easy-chair opposite to that occupied by the
                     Princess.</p>
                  <p>"You are looking tired, my dear Fedora," he said. "You did not sleep well last
                     night, I fear?"</p>
                  <p>"I did not sleep at all," answered the Princess. "I was thinking."</p>
                  <p>"Of what?"</p>
                  <p>"Of my secret."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, to be sure. I am afraid that mysterious secret of yours gives you a great
                     deal of unhappiness. If you would reveal it to me, I might help you."</p>
                  <p>"Yes," answered the Princess, looking the Austrian full in the face; "and you
                     might betray me."</p>
                  <p>"Bah!" exclaimed Oscar Bertrand, carelessly. "It is unkind of you to doubt me,
                     Fedora."</p>
                  <p>"I doubt every one, returned the Princess, "except myself."</p>
                  <p>She clenched her little white hand as she spoke, and the two rose-colored spots
                     glowed suddenly in her cheeks.</p>
                  <p>"My secret is one of life and death!" she continued. "I have a task to perform,
                     and I will achieve my purpose unaided and alone. No man shall boast that his
                     hand helped me. No man shall say that my hand failed. I have made a promise to
                     the dead, and I will keep it myself. If I had trusted others to do the work, it
                     might have been accomplished long ago; for I am rich, and I have plenty of
                     slaves to do my bidding. But I have sworn to strike with my own hand, and I
                     will do it! I will do it!"</p>
                  <p>The Princess rose in her passion, and walked up and down the room, with her
                     hands clasped and her eyes flashing. A strange fire burned in those large dark
                     blue eyes.</p>
                  <p>The Master of the Black Band watched her with a smile upon his face. To him
                     this passionate impetuous woman was an interesting study.</p>
                  <p>Presently she came back to the fireplace, and threw herself into her
                     easy-chair.</p>
                  <p>"Oscar Bertrand," she said, in a cold, suppressed voice, "do not talk to me of
                     my secret. You set me in a flame; and at such a time I am dangerous—even to
                     you. Why have you come here to-day?"</p>
                  <p>"I came because I want your help. Are you composed now? Can you listen calmly
                     to what I have to say?"</p>
                  <p>"O yes, I am quite calm now," answered the Princess, with a sigh. "These storms
                     do not last long. If they did, they would kill me."</p>
                  <p>"Listen to me, then," said Oscar Bertrand; "we must make money in Naples as
                     well as elsewhere. To do so, we want your help. To the world, you are the most
                     charming and delightful of women. To us, you are only a powerful ally."</p>
                  <p>The Princess Fedora, the fascinating Russian Princess, whose wealth and
                     elegance were renowned throughout Europe, was a member of the Black Band.</p>
                  <p>"Well," she said, indifferently; "what is wanted of me?"</p>
                  <p>"The Prince Carignano has arrived in Naples," replied the Austrian. "His house
                     will be open to all the rank and fashion of the city. He is an inveterate
                     gamester, and his saloons will be turned into an aristocratic gambling-house—a
                     hell; to which only elegant women and accomplished men will be welcome. I want
                     you to take the leading part in a confederacy by which I hope to sweep the
                     table of every golden coin which the Prince's guests can place upon it. I have
                     picked my men for this business, and I believe that I have chosen them well. A
                     meeting will be necessary for the full arrangement of our plans. We will meet
                     therefore to-night at ten o'clock in the Vontalini grotto. I will meet you at
                     the opera, and drive you to the Vontalini palace in my carriage."</p>
                  <p>"As you like," answered the Princess, carelessly. "I know the Prince Carignano.
                     I have met him in St. Petersburg. But who is to be in this business?"</p>
                  <p>"Myself, of course."</p>
                  <p>"And who else?"</p>
                  <p>Two men who are strangers to you. One of them is a Frenchman—he was born in
                     France, that is to say; but he is of Spanish origin. The other is an English
                     baronet."</p>
                  <p>"An English baronet," cried the Princess, starting up suddenly from amidst the
                     downy pillows, and looking fixedly at Oscar Bertrand. "What English
                     baronet?"</p>
                  <p>"His name is Temple—Sir Lascelles Temple."</p>

            <p>The foregoing pages give but a slight foretaste of the wonderful incidents which
               crowd the chapters of this remarkable book. Most critics assert that this is MISS
               BRADDON'S very best effort. One thing is certain: OSCAR BERTRAND is the most
               thrillingly interesting work that has appeared for years. It contains an immense
               amount of reading—over 150 of these large pages—and the price is only <emph>Fifty
                  Cents.</emph>
