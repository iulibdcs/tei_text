Some of these bubbles have been, for some time,  floating on the sea of literature-the lightest froth of the restless wave; still there are many of them which hare  never met the public eye, and which are here, for the  first time, set afloat.  And for their publication the writer makes no    apology. Accident has brought these " airy nothings "  into notice; and although many of the thoughts are  not novel in themselves, but are merely whimsically put, and riot a few of the whims are borrowed unhe- sitatingly from others, they are dressed up in a lingual  garb so quaint, eccentric, fantastic, or extravagant, that each lender would be sadly puzzled to kow his own. It is undoubtedly this trick of phrase, this affectation of a new-found style, which has caused their wide- spread newspaper notoriety. And in the hope that  people will buy the book before the, trick is stale, and not suspect the secret of the joke until they read it on this page, the writer has authorized the collection of  these roving unsubstantial ink-brats into their present shelter, and now presents the whole uncouth family   TO THE READER.

This book, like Hodge's razors, was "made to sell ;" and if the sometime good-natured world will pay the price, and have its huge grim smile over these unlicked fancies-although in a political, moral, or utilitarian sense it will have gained nothing-it will, in a literal if not literary view, lose nothing. But if it is in a surly mood, and chooses to look with dignified contempt upon this avowed and candid literary humbug, some one will be disappointed to think he has miscalculated the fickle taste of the aforesaid world, and some one will be out of pocket by its sulky humor; but of these persons, their whereabouts, their circum- stances, or their names, the, world can say nothing, because it will know nothing; no, nothing.

IT is not pretended that this volume is a work of a inspiration, or that any portion of it has been revealed by accommodating "Spirits" through the "Medium" of those crack-brained masculine women, or addle-headed feminine men who profess to act as go-betweens from Earth to the Spirit World. No part of it has been "rapped" out by uneasy tables, or thumped out, by dancing chairs; Doctor Franklin didn't dictate it; Lord Byron didn't write it; Napoleon wasn't consulted about it; Cardinal Richelieu didn't have a finger in it; George the Third hadn't anything to do with it; Shakspeare didn't sug-&#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC8054-00000009"/> "        DOESTICKS.          - gest anything in it; and Benedict Arnold didn't know ? anything about it. That these worthies might have afforded much valuable information, offered many important imr-  provements, and enriched the book with a host of wise opinions, had some sapient "Medium" asked their assistance, is unquestionable. But as neither Andrew Jackson Davis, or any other spiritual call- boy was at the elbow of the writer to summon these desirable but defunct individuals, they were probably left to pursue, in unmolested peace, their favorite and dignified occupations of "tipping" tables, knock- ing on, partitions, drumming on floors, frightening old women and little girls into hysterics, and up- setting the propriety of whole parlors full of furni- ture, whole closets full of glass-ware, and whole cup-boards full of pots, pans and other kitchen gear. For in such intellectual and elevated employments are great men's ghosts engaged, when they pass into a more refined state of existence, if we may credit the assertions of the self-styled "Spiritualists." But, unassisted, and alone, I, the writer, have un- i dertaken this mighty work, instigated , only by the Spirits hereinafter referred to, and by the representa-  tions of my publisher.                ,   HEARS A VOICE.        15 Although at present neither celebrated nor noto- rious, I have a presentiment that I am speedily about to become one or the other. Through an accidental rip in the curtain of futurity, I have caught a glimpse of the Goddess of Fame. I have heard her sing out from her rather elevated position for me to come up and take a "hasty plate" of glory; and I have not the heart to refuse the request of such a good-looking . female, preferred in such elegant language. I am going to shin up the slippery rope leading to her aerial temple (for accurate dimensions and appear- ance, see engraving in the old Elementary Spelling Book), for the purpose of taking a hand in the game of literary renown, trusting that Nature has given me trumps enough to make the -"game," and that Fortune will deal me all " the honors." For weeks I have been haunted perpetually by a voice--not a " still, small voice"--but a large voice, a considerable voice; a voice vociferous, unctuous, and ever-present, and withal insinuating, and n'ot wholly distasteful. It has been constant in my ear, suggesting pleasing hopes and fanciful- desires; and though its notes were often varied, yet ever was the theme the same; and the constant burden of that ceaseless song was, "Write a book! write a book tP  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC8054-00000010"/> 16        DOESTICKS. And in dreams, too, visions of good-looking ladies j with wings, came into my 7x9 chamber, and whis-  I pered in my ear, and they too said, "Write a book!  write a book!"-and one H thought, with versi-   : colored plumage, with her finger on her lip, quoted the perpetually murdered Shakspeare prophetically, and, no doubt, with an eye to the success of the volume aforesaid, and said, suiting with a fairy-like gesture the action to the word, "I could a tale unfold." And plucking a snowy quill, she gave it to me, murmuring, as did all the rest, "Write a book! write a book!" Awoke-put on my pantaloons and boots, and in my shirt sleeves sat down to cogitate. Result is, that I shall use the lengthy quill-I shall accept the pressing invitation of the Goddess- of Fame; and in order most effectually to dis-tinguish or ex-tinguish myself,- hereby with malice aforethought, and the penalty of a failure before my eyes, I, sit down to write a book. But my physician informs me that I have got the "cacoethes scribendi," which he says is as bad as the small-pox, toothache, and yellow fever. The dis- ease, he says, must have its course--it may end in a i malignant biography-result in an infectious broad- j   DETERMNED.         17 sword and blunderbuss, yellow covered nbvel, or degenerate into a weak form of pseudo-sentimental verse writing, in which latter case, on the appearance of the first symptom he intends to order me a lite- rary tombstone. Having fully determined upon making this literary effort, it became necessary to make up my mind as to what should be the- contents of the work. A mental cogitation ensued. Philander was puzzled to know what Doesticks was going to write about- Philander asked Doesticks-whereupon Doesticks, in order to satisfy Philander, replied as follows, upon hearing which reply Philander was content.  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC8054-00000011"/> / II. fSwits W aiis Ai&amp;nRatte -HAT it will be all about, time alone will show, for although I have done a little of almost everything, it- has in most instances been so little, that a premeditated autobiography would pro- bably lack incident, and be deficient in interest. I have not as yet invented humbugs enough to earn a Prince-ly title, and not having made a fortune by ingenious trickery, metallic impudence and barefaced deception, cannot edify the ", darling public," by tell- ing how the thing is done. Never having made fierce love to a lady against her will, followed her from place to place in the small-beer spirit of presumptuous puppyism, been outwitted by her at last, and left to cool my amo- rous passion in a prison, the story of my courtship and its consequence, would not prove attractive. X As I have ever been on .good terms with my   W   ITI G A B OOK.     19 family, I feel no desire, under the guise of a fictitious narrative, to call any members of it miserly and mean, purse-proud and haughty, or to say that others are conceited, vain, selfish, silly, foppish, or weak- brained. Novel writing is out of the question. I have tried that, but met with serious difficulties. I couldn't keep my hero of the same nation-in the first chap- ter I made him a Spaniard; two pages afterward he was an English nobleman; in the fourth chapter an Oriental juggler, balancing a bamboo ladder on his nose, and making a fig-tree grow out of the calf of his leg-and so on, successively, an Italian image- seller, a Dutch burgomaster, a South American Indian, and a Mississippi steamboat pilot. I had as much difficulty in permanently locating the country of my fictitious favorite, as the Know- Nothing party of New York in the late election had, in determining the nativity of their candidate for Govemnor, whose ohandes of election were fair while he was thought to be an American, but who was inally defeated on the ground that he was a Hindoo,   : and owned stock in the car of Juggernaut.

N. PEPPER, ESQ.. whose matchless lays  have won for him undying fame, and the admiration  of several; and who so outruns competition that there is nothing left to be done in that direction. ? In the play-writing vein, I have also failed; not from any lack of merit in my drama, as the manager g solemnly assured me, but because he had not the menagerie requisite to its proper representation. Improving upon the hint offered by the managers of  the "Thespicm Wigwam," who have added an ele- I phant and a circus company to their company of "gifted artists," I had introduced into my play a , rhinoceros, a lioness, two hyenas, a team of " two- forty" reindeers, a couple of ostriches, and a muley- cow,-and even then there was but a slight obstacle --the manager might have procured the animals, but, he was afraid the cow would quarrel with the rhinoceros, and so disturb the harmony of his esta- blishment. But this book, Philander, it will be impossible to class as strictly either classic, scientific, historical, humorous, or descriptive. Fantastic and extrava- gant it will be in many things; but we will do our best to make it agreeable to the palate of the public, I promise everything, like all book-makers, and I   WBITING A BOOK.         21 shall afterwards perform what is convenient, follow- ing the same reliable precedent.

I shall praise, flatter, and commend everybody and everything, that everyone may receive his meed of approbation; and I shall also censure, find fault, and criticise in an equally universal manner, that no one may escape his proper castigation. I shall set forth a great multitude of fancies, theo- ries, and hypotheses, that those who are fond of inno- vation may not lack gratification; and I shall imme- diately proceed to controvert and deny them all, that the conservative portion of community be not offended. I shall cry down education and instruction, for there are those who consider all teaching an @vil; and on the other hand, I shall advocate learning and science, for there is a very respectable minority' which insist that the people may advantageously be taught something more., I shall not stand up for love and charity, for it might induce people to love the wrong persons, and to give their pennies to imposters; and yet I shall;  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC8054-00000013"/> 22        Do ETI K S not eulogize avarice and hate, for there are a few who think benevolence and kindness preferable even to these. I shall not throw my influence in the scale of Pro- testantism lest the Catholics should take offence, nor yet shall strive to build up Catholicism, lest thereby the dislike of the Orthodoxy be incurred. Nor shall I show myself a partisan of religion of any kind, for the Atheist says it is all a farce. Neither shall I en- deavor to inculcate principles of infidelity, for there is still an occasional prejudice in favor of Chris- tianity.  It will be " a work which no gentleman's library should be without."

YOUNG men in the west, when they get too lazy to plough, drive oxen, and dig potatoes, inva- riably either go to studying Law, Physic, or Divinity, or emigrate to New York to make their fortunes. Hence the inundation of two-and-sixpenny pettifog- gers, the abundant crop of innocent-looking juvenile M. D's, and the army of weak-eyed preachers, whose original simplicity is too deeply rooted to be ever overgrown by the cares of after life. The portion of our country known as " the West" sends forth every year scores of these misguided innocents, who, had S they stayed at home, might have grown up into tolera- ble farmers, or even been cultivated into respectable mechanics, but who, being once throwninto the whirl of city life, degenerate into puny clerks with not half salary enough to pay for their patent-leather boots.

Y. mer- chants pay for than the most knowing of them are aware of; and their wives would be astounded to learn how many bracelets and diamond pins had been presented to ladies of the theatre and ballet, and bought with their husbands' money. And many a country mnother would mourn to hear that her darling had, in the first six months of his city life, learned to practise more vices than she had ever heard of, and among his other attainments, had acquired the elegant city accomplishment of spending his employer's money as freely as if it was his own.

Accordingly, since that time, I have striven hard to acquire such a knowledge of the city that I could find any of the theatres without a Directory, and get home at any time of night without the escort of a  Policeman.     -                      *i  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC8054-00000023"/> 42        DOE STICKS.

IMMEDIATELY upon my arrival in -the city of Newsboys and Three-cent Stages, I proceeded, as hereinbefore mentioned, to the white-faced Hotel which is surmounted by the bird called Shanghai, who seems from the top of his lofty perch where he roosts a unreachable security, to crow over neighboring boroughs, and exult in the great glory of the Man- hattan Island. It required, however, but a few days o weary of the " constant noise and confusion" of this saintly mansion, and to become sick of the eter- nal presence of men in white aprons who are every- where at the same time, and who are, mathemati-' cally speaking, a constant quantity.- These waiters are certainly ubiquitous; at the table there is one at each elbow, at night a stronger is escorted to bed by a grand procession, and one pulls off his boots while another unbuttons his shirt; "        Up  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC8054-00000027"/> 50       DOESTI CKS.  collar, and a third lights the gas and turns down the bed-clothes; a waiter meets you at the door, another takes away your overcoat and gives it to a waiter who presents you with a brass check for it-there are waiters in the bar, in the washroom, in the bar- ber-shop, in the cellar, in the reading-room; waiters running races through the halls all night; there is always a snowy neckerchief and an outstretched palm when-you leave the premises, and on sunshiny days-there is invariably a distant glimpse of a white- jacket on the roof of the house. As soon after my arrival as I could collect my senses, and knew enough not to take every M. P. for a foreign ambassador, and pull off my hat to the Star, I deemed it advisable to search for lodgings more quiet, and not so expensive. It took about a fortnight to restore my mind to its accustomed serenity, and then having become, to a -certain-extent, a fixture in this high old town, it be- came necessary to search out a fit habitation, where- in I might eat, sleep, change my shirt (Damphool blushes), and attend to the other comforts of the ex- ternal hamo, and the inner individual. My friend Bull Dogge having deserted his late place of residence, (on account of the perpetual   gI iFINDS A BOARDING HOUSE.           51 reign of salt mackerel at the breakfast table), we started together on a voyage of discovery. To de- scribe all the dilapidated gentlewomen, whose apart- ments we inspected-all the many inducements which were used to persuade us to take up our quar- ters in all sorts of musty smelling rooms, and to re- count how many promises we made to " call again," would take too much time. Suffice it to say, that at six o'clock in the evening, wearied out and desperate, we cast anchor in the do- micile of an Irish lady with one eye. She assured us that her boarders were all " rispictible, and found their own tibaecy, and that there was divil a bug in the place." We took adjoining rooms, and resignedly went down to tea. I noticed that my cup had evidently sustained a compound comminuted fracture, and been patched up with putty (which came off in my tea)-that the bread was scant-the butter powerful-the tea, "on the contraly, quite the reverse,"-however, although matters looked somewhat discouraging" hoping against hope"-we retired to our respective rooms. Horror of horror!! O! most horrible!!!

For two hours I maintained a sanguinary combat with an odoriferous band of determined cannibal in- sects-armed only with a fire-shovel, I gallantly kept up the unequal conflict--but the treacherous imple- ment broke at the critical moment; I thought I should be compelled to yield-despair filled all my senses my heart failed me-my brain grew dizzy with horror-hurried thoughts of enemies unpar- doned-of duties neglected-and of errors com- mitted, rushed across my mind-a last thought of cherished home and absent friends was in my heart, and with a hasty prayer for mercy and forgiveness, was at the point of yielding, when my frantic eye caught sight of my cast-iron boot-jack. With an ex- clamation of pious gratitude to heaven, (Bull Dogge says it did not sound so to him), I seized it, and with the desperate strength of a dying man I renewed the battle, and eventually came off victorious and triumphant. Weary with slaughter, I fell exhausted on the bed, and slept till morning; Bull Dogge, who had been engaged in the same delightful occupation, appeared at the breakfast table with one eye black, and his face spotted like a he-tiger. We held a   HAS ANOTHER HOME.        53 council of war, and resolved 'instantly to quit the premises of the Emerald Islander, who had agreed to "Iodge and eat " us (the she-Cyclops), and who had so nearly fulfilled the latter clause by proxy. Another search and another home. Here for a week things went on tolerably well; the steak was sometimes capable of mastication, the coffee wasn't always weak, nor the butter always strong; but one day there appeared at breakfast a dish of beef, (Bull Dogge asserts that it was the fossil remains of an omnibus horse)-it was not molested; at dinner it made its appearance again, still it was not disturbed; at tea fragments of it were visible, but it yet re- mained untouched; in the morning a tempting look- ing stew made its appearance, but, alas! it was only a weak invention of the enemy to conceal the ubiquitous beef; at dinner a meat-pie enshrined a portion of the aforesaid beef; it went away unharmed.          . For a week, every day, at every meal, in every subtle form, in some ingenious disguise, still was forced upon our notice this omnipresent beef; it went through more changes than Harlequin in the Pantomime, -and like that nimble individual came always out uninjured.    &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC8054-00000029"/> 54       D OESTICK S. At the end of the second day Bull Dogge grum- bled to himself; the third he spoke " out in meeting;" the fourth he growled audibly; the fifth he had an hour's -swear to himself in his own room; the sixth, seventh, and eighth, he preserved a dignified silence; but his silence was ominous, on the ninth day we both left. Our next landlady had a gigantic mouth, but her nose was a magnificent failure. We stayed with her a week, and left because she seemed to be possessed of the idea that one sausage was enough for two men. For a month longer we ran the gauntlet of all the model boarding-houses. We were entrapped by all kinds of alluring promises, and perpetually swindled without any regard to decency; we had a taste of Yankee, French, Dutch, and, I have men- tioned it before, (ye gods!), Irish; and we lived four-days in an establishment presided over by a red- eyed darkey, with a wife the color of a new saddle. At last one day in an agony of despair I exclaimed, "Where, O where can humbugged humanity find a decent place to feed?"Echo answered, "In the eating-houses."

In fact, we are suited; if anything runs short, "John gets particular its," and " nuthin' shorter ;" where we can eat when we please, and call for what we please; where charges are moderate, and it is permitted to grumble at the waiter for nothing.

IT has been a cherished superstition of our ances- tors that water as a beverage is innocuous; I my- self was laboring under this infatuated delusion when I left the shades of private life, and the sweet reti- racy of the swamps of Michigan, to become a denizen of the Island City. Believing that my previous experience in the ar- ticle justified me in drinking freely of the treach- erous liquid, I did not hesitate on my arrival here to imbibe -on various occasions as much of the undi- luted Croton as my thirsty body seemed to need. How I was deceived in the potency of the fluid a single night's experience will show; I am confident that on this particular occasion I was bewitched by the mischievous God of the stream called the Cro ton, and that, if I had given him any further oppor-    &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC8054-00000031"/> 58        DOESTICKS. tunities to exercise his craft, my name would posi- tively have appeared in the Police Reports some morning, and Doesticks would have been therein stigmatized as "Drunk and Disorderly."  But the imputation would be slanderous,--I will lay before the public the events of a single night, and its verdict shall be a triumphant vindication of my character,-shall exculpate the Deity Bacchus (now resident in Ohio,) fromn the grave charge of leading me astray,--and lay the entire blame of the transac- tion upon the rascal River God. Only once in my life have I been drunk. It was a youthful inebriation, caused by partaking too freely of cider made from apples with worms in them. At present I am sober. If, since my sojourn in this city, I have been intoxicated, then the time has arrived when any person who wishes to hlave a regular "-drunk" need only apply to the nearest hydrant. Heretofore I have supposed water to be a beve- rage innocent and harmless; but now-well ; no mat- ter-I will not anticipate. Listen while I relate a "plain, unvarnished tale." I left my boarding-house in company with a friend, intending-to witness the Shakspearian revival at Bur- ton's-the "Midsummer lNight's Dream." Before   CROTON  WATER.        59 leaving the hotel, at his suggestion, we partook of a potable, known, I think, as punch-whiskey punch. I watched attentively the preparation of this agree- able beverage, and I am certain that there entered into its composition a certain amount of water-- Croton water, as I have every reason to believe ; and I am also sure that in that treacherous draught I im- bibed the first instalment of that villanous liquid which produced the diabolical state of facts I am about to describe ; and also that the second and third of those ingenious inventions (both of which we drank on the spot) were as guilty, in this respect, as their "' illustrious predecessor!" And I furthermore conscientiously state that my glass of brandy (one of a couple we ordered soon afterwards), and which, according to my invariable - custom, should have been ' straight," was also sur- reptitiously diluted with the same detestable fluid by the malicious bar-keeper, for I remember experien- cing a slight confusion on going out, and mistaking a topsail schooner for the Broadway theatre. aWe immediately entered another saloon to procure the wherewith to steady our nerves, when we par- took of two gin cocktails and a brandy smash indivi- dually, and I state, according to the best of my ;  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC8054-00000032"/> 60        DOESTICKS. knowledge and belief, that our principal ingredient in each and every one of these compounds was wa. ter-Croton water--culpably introduced therein by some evil-disposed persons without my knowledge or consent. On leaving this saloon, I noticed that my friend, although a single man, had by some mysterious pro- cess of multiplication become two. I kept fast hold of both, and, after doubling, With a great deal of difficulty, a great number and variety of corners, we reached Burton's. Tickets being mysteriously procured, weentered, and eventually obtained seats. Finding, after prolonged trial, that it was impractica- ble to put my hat in my vest pocket, I placed it on the floor, and put both feet in it. The theatre gene- rally seemed to be somewhat mixed up. The par- quette, gallery, and- dress circle were all one; and the stage was whirling round at a rate which must have been extremely inconvenient to the revolving actors. At length, after a liberal allowance of overture, tile curtain went up, and I was enabled, by the most unremitting attention, to concentrate the actors suffi- ciently to understand the performance. And many tilings which I hitherto deemed dramatically in-   " ATT BUR TON  .      61 correct were presented to my wondering vision then and there. "Hippolyta" was dressed in knee-breeches and brogans, and "Titania" did not, to me, present a very fairy-like appearance in a fireman's red shirt and a three-cocked hat. "Oberon" was not so ob- jectionable (being a gentleman,) in a talma and plaid pantaloons, though even he might have blacked his boots and omitted the spurs. I fear I did not properly appreciate the rest of the fairies, who had their heads decorated with sunflowers and their hands full of onions. At last the entertainment was concluded, and I remember consulting with my duplicated friend as to the feasibility of a return to Brooklyn, to our boarding-house.  On our journey thither we wit- nessed many strange things about which I desire in- formation. In the first place, is it the custom, as a general thing, for the City Hall and Barnum's Museum to indulge in an animated contra-dance up and down Broadway in the middle of the night, accompanied in their fantastic movements, by the upper story of Stewart's and the Bible Society's building? For they certainly did on that eventful evening, and I fee],   &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC8054-00000033"/> 62       D E S T I CKS. called upon to enter my solemn protest' against these nocturnal architectural saltatory exhibitions, as un- worthy the dignity of the Empire City. And I would, with all humility, suggest, that if the stony goddess of Justice, whose appropriate place is-on the. top of the City Hall, will desert her respon- sible post, she might choose a more becoming amuse- ment than sitting cross-legged on the top of a Hous- ton street stage, playing the jews-harp. I am now convinced that Bowling-Green fountain is not permanently located on the top of Trinity Church cross; but that it was on that memorable night, my wondering eyes bore ample testimony. I am sufficiently well acquainted with the city to know that the Astor House should be found on the, corner of Barclay street, but I am ready to take my oath that on that particular occasion1 it plied as an opposition ferry-boat between Whitehall street and Hamilton avenue. The last thing I distinctly recol- lect is trying to pay the fare for three on this novel craft, with a single piece of money (which I now know to have been a Bungtown copper), and demand- ing two-and-sixpence change, which I didn't get. In the morning I found myself in bed with my overcoat on, and afterwards discovered my boots un-   AT  0M-E.

I presume I had tried to write a letter to some one with my tooth-brush, as I found that article in my inkstand. Now, if Croton water interferes with my suscep- tible system in this unaccountable manner, what shall I drink? I would resort to milk, but I fear our city edition of the lacteal contains sufficient of the aqueous enemy to again upset my too delicate nerves. I exclaim, like Caesar, when he, too, was afflicted with superfluity of water, "Help me, Cassius, or I sink!"

The fortzue-tellers of the city are  these, and they certainly deserve praise for attempting to apply their pretended knowledge to some practical use, instead of dealing entirely with abstractions. In New York these people are numerous, and they pick up as many coppers in quite as honest a way as their fellows in the art of table-tipping notoriety.

The calling has degenerated, and the necromantic trade has passed into the hands of unworthy succes- sors, who would steal their living, if cheating, wasn't easier.

The materials are varied-the ingredients some- times curious-a company being sometimes composed entirely of journeymen tailors, blacksmiths' appren- tices, master carpenters, clerks, porters, coalheavers, stagedrivers, candy-peddlers, pop-corn men, or those persevering individuals who roast perpetual chest- nuts on the sidewalk in tin pans-fire companies, express companies, policemen, gangs of men from all kinds of mammoth shops-for wherever thirty or forty individuals work in the same house, they form themselves into a military company, and once or twice every year go to Hoboken and shoot for whis- key and other prizes. When they want to make a full turn-out, the places of any missing members are filled by extemporane- t ous volunteers. It was in this capacity that I pro- ? posed to go. In these companies there are always  I more officers than men, more epaulettes than mus- kets-always a big band of music, and two darkies to carry the target.

Every member has a whiskey-bottle in his cartridge- box, or a brandy-flask in his knapsack. As a general thing, they turn their toes in, and are bandy-legged-they carry their guns over their shoulders at all conceivable angles, and so little do they know about fire-arms, that probably, if called to load their muskets in a hurry, two out of three would put their cartridges in their breeches pockets, and stick their percussion caps on the ends of their ramrods.

Six or eight men, called pioneers, march in front, with muffs on their heads, leather aprons tied around their waists, and theoretical axes in their hands, which could never, by any possibility, be made to cut anything. The officers walk between the platoons, flourishing their dandy swords--their attention being pretty equally divided between keeping the men in the line, keeping the little boys out of the line, keeping their unaccustomed white cot- ton gloves on, and trying to keep step with the music. In single file the men march like a flock of geese on their winding way to the mill-pond, and six or eight abreast, they go with the regularity of a crowd of school-boys, effecting a masterly but hurried retreat from somebody's melon-patch. In order to make them form a straight line, it is necessary to back them up against a brick block, or make them stand between the tracks of a railroad.       -  Such was the company of which I became a mem- - ber for a- brief eventful time.

"Order -arms!" Brought it down on the toes of my neighbor. "Shoul- der armns!" again. Got it on the right shoulder this time, but in so doing knocked off the cap of the man next to me, &amp;c.

Now came the shooting. Nigger set the target at twenty paces-four volleys and not a ball in it- moved it up to fifteen-no better- luck-moved it again, one ball put in it this time by a clumsy Dutch- man, who shut his eyes when he fired, and hit by mistake. Finding that shooting was no use, captain adopted the usual plan-set the target at ten paces, blindfolded the men, and each one charged on it with the auger; where the point happened to hit, he bored a hole, and the one nearest the bull's eye took the prize. I could see a little through a hole in the cloth--consequence : hit the centre and took the first prize, (a plated cake-basket with a pewter handle, bought for silver by the sagacious Committee). As the brandy had circulated pretty freely, some of the shots were rather wild--several missed the target entirely and knocked their heads against the trees; one bored a deep hole in a sand bank, and the first lieutenant was put under arrest for attemnpt- ing to tap the captain.

Marched home in as good order as circumstances would allow-the darkey .bearing in proud triumph the perforated target, which had so many hits near the centre, as to excite the admiration of the deluded public, which, as a general rule, in such cases, can't tell a bullet mark from an auger-hole.  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC8054-00000045"/> XI.

Bought a gallon of tar, a cake of beeswax, and a firkin of lard, and in twenty-one hours I presented to the world the first batch of "Doesticks' Patent, Self-Acting, Fout-Horse Power Balsam," designed to cure all diseases of mind, body, or estate, to give- strength to the weak, money to the poor, bread and butter to the hungry, boots to the barefoot, decency to blackguards, and common sense to the Know- Nothings. It acts physically, morally, mentally, psychologically, physiologically, and geologically, and it is intended to make our sublunary sphere a blissful paradise, to which Heaven itself shall be but a side-show. I have not yet brought it to absolute perfection, but even now it acts with immense force, as you will perceive by the  accompanying testimonials and records of my own individual experience. You will observe that I have not resorted to the usual manner of preparing certificates: which is, to be certain that , 4*  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC8054-00000046"/> 86         D O E S T I C KS . all those intended for Eastern circulation shall seenm to come from some formerly unheard-of place in the West, while those sent to the West shall be dated at some place forty miles east of sun-rise. But I send to you, as representing the western country, a certifi- cate from an Oregon farmer. "DEAR SIR: The land composing my farm has hitherto been so poor that a Scotchman couldn't get his living off it; and so stony that we had to slice our potatoes and plant them edgeways; but" hearing of your balsam, I put some on the corner: of a ten-acre lot, surrounded by a rail-fence, and in the morning I found the rocks had entirely disappeared-a neat stone wall encircled the field, and the rails were split into ovenwood and piled up symmetrically in my back yard. Put half an ounce into the middle of a huckleberry swamp-in two days it was cleared off, planted with corn and pumpkins, and had a row of peach trees in full bloom through the middle. As an evidence of its tremendous strength, I would state that it drew a striking likeness of my eldest daughter--drew my youngest boy out of the mill-pond-drew a blister all over his stomach- drew a load of potatoes four miles to market, and eventually drew a prize of ninety-seven dollars in th3 State Lottery. And the effect upon the inhabitants hereabout has been so wonderful, that they have opened their eyes to the good of the country, and are determined to vote for a Governor who is opposed to frosts in the middle of June, and who will make a positive law against freshets, hail-storms, and the seventeen-year locusts." Thelre, isn't that some 2   RECEIVES TESTIMONIALS.           87 But I give one more from a member of the senior class in a western college, who, although misguided, neglected, and ignorant, is, undoubtedly, as honest and sincere as his Prussianized education will admit of.

"SALL HARBOR, June 31, 1854. "MY DEAR DOCTOR. [You know I attended medical lectures half a winter, and once assisted in getting a crooked needle out of a baby's leg; so I understand perfectly well the theory and practice of medicine, and the Doctor is perfectly legitimate under the Prus- sian system.] By the incessant study required in this establish- ment, I had become- worn down so thin that I was obliged to put on an overcoat to cast a shadow--but accidentally hearing of your Balsam, I obtained a quantity, and, in obedience to the Homoeopa- thic principles of this Institution, took an infinitesimal dose only; in four days I measured one hundred and eighty-two inches round the waist; could chop eleven cords of hickory wood in two hours and a half; and, on a bet, carried a yoke of oxen two miles and a quarter in my left hand, my right being tied behind me, and if any one doubts the fact, the oxen are still to be seen. "About two weeks after this, I had the pleasure of participating in a gunpowder explosion, on which occasion my arms and lega- Tltrej isn't that source 2   &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC8054-00000047"/> 88 -        DOE S T ICKS . were scattered over the village, and my mangled remains pretty equally distributed throughout the entire county. Under these circumstances my life was despaired of, and my classmates had bought a pine coffin, and borrowed whole shirts to attend the funeral in; when the invincible power of your four horse-power balsam (which I happened to have in my vest pocket) suddenly brought together the scattered pieces of my body-col- lected my limbs from the rural districts-put new life into my shat- tered frame, and I was restored, uninjured to my friends, with a new set of double teeth. I have preserved the label which enveloped the bottle, and have sewed it into the seat of my pantaloons, and I now bid grim death defiance, for I feel that I am henceforth unkillable, and in fact I am even now generally designated the ' Great Westertn Achilles.'

I caused some to be applied to the Washtenaw Bank after its failure, and while the Balsam     lasted the Bank redeemed its notes with specie.

Gave a few drops gratis to a poor woman who was earning a precarious subsistence by making calico shirts with a one-eyed needle, and the next day she was discovered to be heir to a large fortune. Gave some to an up-tdwn actor, and that night he said " damned" only twenty-one times. One of the -daily papers got the next dose, and in the next edition but one there were but four edito- rial falsehoods, seven indecent advertisements, and two columns and a half of home-made "Foreign Correspondence." Caused fifteen drops to be given to the low come- dian of a Broadway Theatre, and that night he was positively dressed more like a man than a monkey, actually spoke some lines of the author, made only three inane attempts at puerile witticisms--only twice went out of his way to introduce some grossly inde- licate line into his part, and for a wonder, lost so much of his self-conceit that for a full half-hour he did not believe himself the greatest comedian in the world.

Put some on the outside of the Crystal Palace and the same day the stock went from 22 up to 44. Our whole Empire City is entirely changed by the miraculous power of "Doesticks' Patent Self- Acting Four Horse Power Balsam."   The gas is lighted on the dark nights, instead of on the moon- light evenings-there are no more highway robberies in the streets, or, if there are, the offenders, when arrested, are instantly discharged by the police ma- gistrate. No more building materials on the side- walks; no more midnight murders; no more Sun- day rows; no more dirty streets; no more duels in Hoboken, and no more lies in the newspapers. Broadway is swept and garnished': the M. P.'s are civil, and the boys don't steal any mofre dogs. In fact, so well content are we now with our City, that we feel, as the Hibernian poet so beautifully says: "O, if there be an Elysium on earth, It is this-it is this." Orders for my Balsam, accompanied by the money, will be immediately attended to; otherwise not, for nmy partner and I have resolved to sell for cash only,        g   SELLS FOR CASH.        91 feeling as did Dr. Young, who appropriately and feelingly reparks- "We take no notes on Time."

I am aware that in these instances my medicine has per- formed a modern miracle, but the facts remain " no less true than strange." If I fail to accumulate a " pile" in this speculation, I shall start a Know-Nothing Newspaper, run it a month, and then fail and swindle the subscribers; get an overgrown woman or a whiskered lady, and exhibit her for twenty-five cents a head, or get up a Grand Gift Enterprise, with $20,000 prizes. ,.  ..   &#xD;<pb n="92" xml:id="VAC8054-00000049"/> -NCE the "G e old  Staifsg b@Xt tl^"  WIIttn+ -INCE the "Grate old Squwirt" made to go by steam, and imported from Cincinnati to put to the blush Metropolitan Redshirtdom, and which couldn't raise steam enough to throw water to the top of the City Hall, has proved such a signal failure, the good old-fashioned " fire-annihilators" (not Bar- num's) have been more popular than ever.

As I had been hustled round pretty constantly for several weeks, I had become fairly tired of New York, although it is a town of con- siderable consequence. Wanted to see the world; so started for the seven-by-nine State of Rhode Island. In the course of a thorough exploration of that delightful though diminutive state, which occu- pied me about five hours, I discovered that they shingle the houses all over outside and in, and put the windows in the roof; they make their rail fences out of cobble stones; the ducks roost on the fence, and hatch their young ones in the tops of the cherry   IN RHODE ISLA-ND.       103 trees; the men look so much alike, their wives often kiss the wrong individual, (Damphool says it's a way women have the world over). Went to the city of Providence, where all the men make jewelry, and all the women believe in spirit rappings; where they've got a bridge wider than it is long, and Macadamized on both sides; where all the plaster busts of great men have grey wigs on; where they light the gas in the middle of the after- noon; where they drive five horses tandem; where the apples grow as big as washtubs, and the oysters obtain the enormous size of three-cent pieces. Went into the woods after chestnuts.; couldn't find any, but discovered a magnificent tree in the distance -rejoiced exceedingly thereat-started for it-three a quarters of a mile away; went ahead over stones, ditches, fences, snakes, briers, and stone walls, until at last I reached it, and found it was an elm, no chestnuts on it--got very mad; walked round the state a couple of times, and took the first train for home. Glad to see the old place again, and also pleased to perceive that something of unusual importance seemed to occupy the attention of the ,usually- hard-at-work-but-on-Sunday-loafing-about-the-streets- 5  4         &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC8054-00000056"/> 104       DOE STICKS. waiting-for-a-fire-or-a-row-to-turn-up population of the city. Saw a big crowd in the Park-inquired about it, and was told the usual Street Screeching was going on-wanted to see the fun-got a good place on a fat Irishman's toes. Enter Gabriel--tin horn-hole in his pantaloons-- (Bull Dogge says that if Angels have wings they are also provided with tails-hence this last item); thought it extremely probable. Gabriel mounted one end of the City Hall steps, and after a preliminary over- ture on his horn, and a slight skirmish among the faithful, resulting in four black eyves, a damaged nose, and a broken leg, the religious services com- menced-(Damphool was entirely carried away by his sympathies for this last martyr, but soon dis- covered that the fractured member was "purely vegetable," as the patent medicine men say, and the injury was speedily repaired by means of a few shingle nails and a piece of clapboard).

She, like Gabe, went in for giving the church of Rome "Jesse," but otherwise did not agree with him.

With the dignified and majestic bearing peculiar to his countrymen, he slowly mounted the steps, and took a position directly between the two, and in a voice strongly tinctured with the i"sweet brogue," announced himself as a champion of that much slandered gentleman, the Pope of Rome. At this astounding impudence, the woman for a single instant held her peace. Gabe was so taken aback that he seemed about to collapse, but rallied, played an " ad libitum" interlude on the tin horn, and all hands " pitched in." Gabriel commenced the onset by asserting that the Pope is not strictly a bachelor, but has seven white wives in his parlor, thirteen ditto bound in law calf in the library, a hundred' and forty-one   ^    SHOWS WHAT CAN BE DONE.       107 golden-haired damsels in his private apartments, I and a perfect harem of jetty beauties in the coal- hole.

Irishman indignantly denied all-said the country is going to the old Knick, and some fine morning we shall wake up, and find that the Pope, unable longer to endure our perverseness, has sunk us all forty miles deeper than ancient Sodom; said that his Ho- liness can send us all to perdition by one wink of his left eye;- that he is the head of the Church on Earth; has all power to save -or otherwise; could get us all out of Purgatory, and send us all " kitin into Heaven," by wagging his little finger; that he could, like a Joshua No. 2, make the sun and moon stand still; make the planets-dance an astronomical riga- doon; cause the hills and mountains to execute a mighty geological jig, while old ocean should beat  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC8054-00000058"/> / 108       D O E S T ICKS. the time against the blue vault of Heaven and ap- plauding Angels encore the huge saltations.

At the word Know-Nothing, there was a great sensation. Symptoms of a free fight rapidly deve- loped into an uncivil war.

"THOUGH in the course of my western pere- grinations I had frequently met with attractive- looking damsels, there was always some blemish on their personal beauty, which though perhaps slight in many cases, made their charms fall short of that exalted standard desirable in the fairer part of man- kind.

Never had I been so shamefaced in the feminine presence before, and my bashfulness only temporarily deserted me, when, after much tribula- tion, I achieved a seat on a clumsy looking foot-stool, which I understood was called an  "Ottoman.'" Whether or not it had any connection with Turks, . turkeys, and Thanksgiving, I failed to discover. Left alone a short time, I had leisure to recover myself, and to note the individual charms of my fair enslaver. A partial inventory of her visible apparel is ineffaceably stamped upon my mind.

When I bid her c" good night," she took my hand and set me crazy by the touch of her fairy, taper fingers. I dreamed all night about Calanthe--got up in the morning, called the waiter "Calanthe," and said "my darling" to him as he handed me my coffee- gave my tailor -an order for a new coat and two pairs of pantaloons, and told him to charge them -to "Calanthe"-got a box of cigars and a demijohn of Scotch whiskey, and signed the drayman's receipt "Calanthe"-all the signs read "Calanthe"-every street was "Calanthe" street-all the stages, belonged to the "Calanthe" line, and were going to "Caantthe" f    IN EXTAOIES.        115 ferry--the ship "Calanthe" had arrived, the steam- boat "Calanthe" had burst her boiler, and the brig ,Calanthe" been seen bottom upward with her rudder gone. I saw, heard, read, dreamed, thought,  and talked nothing but "Calanthe," and cannibal that I am, I verily believe I ate nothing but "Calanthe" for a month. The day after I saw her first I felt so exceedingly amiable that I bought something of every pedler gi k who came into the store-laid in a stock of matches, pencils, shoe-brushes, suspenders, bootjacks, and blacking, which will last me a short lifetime-bought so much candy that the office-boy had the colic every afternoon for a week-called the applewoman '" my own sweet love," and said "thank you, darling," when she gave me pewter dimes in change. Wrote spasmodic poetry about CaIanthe's hair- lines to her raven tresses stanzas to her locks of jet --odes to her ebon ringlets-verses to her sable curls J- -rhymes to her coal-black hair, and commenced a ' poem in 17 cantos, to her ebony-topped head, but oct reflection I was led to doubt the propriety of the comparison.

We went to the theatre, endured the negro min- strels, and braved the horrors of a second-rate Italian Opera Company-in fact, everywhere, where there was anything to be seen or heard, there were Calan- the Maria, and her devoted Philander. For a month I forgot my debts, neglected busi- ness, ignored entirely this mundane sphere, and lived in a rainbow-colored aerial castle, of the most elegant finish-surrounded by roses, attended by cupids, and just big en ogh for Calanthe Maria and the subscriber. In that happy place there were no duns, no tailors' bills, no trouble, no debts, no getting up early cold mornings, no tight boots, no bad cigars: nothing but love, luxury, and Calanthe Maria. Came down occasionally out of my airy mansion, to speak a few words of compassion to my companions in the office, who hadn't got any Calanthe, but I went right back again as quick as I could to that rose-colored dream-land where love and Calanthe were " boss and all hands.".   L L FARNS HS FOLLY.      117 At last, one fatal evening I was undeceived. We were waltzing, and through some clumsiness on my part, her hair caught in a gas-fixture-some mysterious string broke, and those glossy ringlets, the object of my adorationcame off, leaving her head bald as a brickbat. Relating this scrape of the locks to a friend, he informed me that the rest of her charms would not bear minute inspection, for she wore false teeth, and bought her complexion at Pha- lon's; that her graceful form was the result of a skilful combination of cotton and whalebone. This was too much. Whfile I thought Calanthe a woman, I loved her, but, the discovery of the fishy element excited a prejudice-as a female, she had my affection, and I contemplated matrimony-as a land mermaid, I had no desire to swindle Barnum and become her proprietor. Coming as I did, from a section of the country where they have humnan women, and where they don't attempt to deceive masculine mank-ind with French millinery strategy, I was unprepared for counterfeits, and had been easily deluded by a spurious article. But I find that in New York, perambulating bundles of dry goods not unfrequently pass current as women--and the milliners now put  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC8054-00000063"/> "8       DOE STIKs. their eccentric inventions upon these locomotive shams, to the great neglect of those revolving waxen ladies who used to perform their perpetual gyrations in the show-windows.

[ My madness was now over-the intoxication of love was dissipated, and I was once more able to get about my business without having a feminine name constantly present to my eyes. The stages, the dry- goods' boxes, the streets and signs, were once more lettered in sensible characters. I was guilty of no more poetry, went to no more operas-in short, exhibited no longer any of the signs of insanity, but relapsed at once into my former unpoetical condition -the spell was broken-the blind fiend was exor- cised-reason got back to her old bunk, and "Richard was himself again."

Such church-going people are remarkably easy on the Bible-most of the doctrines therein inculcated having been long since explained away by their three-thousand-dollar clergyman, who measures his people for their religion, and fits them with as much nicety as their tailors or dressmakers do in the case of more visible wardrobe. One or two Sundays after my first appearance in this town of patent Christianity, I attended service for the first time. Having seen the opera with   detestation, the theatres with approbation, George Christy with cachinnation, and No. 2 Dey street with affiliation; laving visited Castle Garden, the model artists, and the American Museum; in fact, knowing some- thing of almost all the other places of amusement :  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC8054-00000065"/> 122       DOESTIO KSS. in the city, I resolved to complete and crown my knowledge by going to church, and I hope I may receive due credit' for my pursuit of amusement under difficulties. I made known my heroic deter- mination  to  my new-found friends, and thev instantly resolved to bear me company--Bull Dogge by way of variety, and Damphool from force of habit-- ull Dogge seldom goes to church, and Damphool always does). Sunday morning came, and the aforesaid indi- viduals presented themselves-B. D. looked pug- nacious and pugilistic, and Damphool perfectly marvellous--in fact, majestic as this latter-named person had ever borne himself, and importantly huge as he had ever appeared, his coat tails were now so wonderfully short, his collar so enviably large, and so independently upright, and his hat so unusually and magnificently lofty, that he certainly looked a bigger Damphool than ever before. Walked up Broadway through a crowd ofpeople of all sorts, sizes, colors, and complexions; country- men running over every third man they met; NSew Yorkers threading their way through apparently - un-get-thro'-a-ble crowds without ruffling their tempers or their shirt collars--(By the way, I hlave   !

For about a quarter of a mile on either side of the entrance there extended a row of carriages, lined with satin, withl velvet cushions; and on every carriage there were a couple of men with white gloves on, gold bands round their hats, a black rosette on the side, and a short cloak over their shoulders, with cloth enough in the multitudinous capes of each to make a full suit of clothes for a common-sized man, and three or four half grown boys. Bull Dogge informed me that these were the liveried flunkies of our republican aristocracy, and that it was made their business to sit outside the church and watch the lazy over-fed horses, while their owners were inside saying American " amens"  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC8054-00000066"/> I 124       DOESTICKS. to democratic prayers that liberty and equality may be established over all the earth. The coachman spends his Sabbath hours in the pious occupation of cracking his whip at the little boys who are playing marbles on the side-walk, reading the Sunday papers, and saying hard words at the flies which make his horses shake their nettings off-while the genteel footman goes to sleep in the carriage, with his boots out of the window, and only arouses from his slumber in time to open the door for my lady, as she comes from her courtly devotions. We passed the scrutiny of these gentlemen with- out exciting any audible impertinence, and reached the door of the church.  Everything looked so grandly gingerbready that I hesitated about going in. Little boy in the corner (barefooted, with a letter in the post-office) told us to "go in,' and called us "lemons." Did not perceive the force of his pomological remark, but "went -u " never. theless. Man in a white cravat showed us to a pew; floor covered with carpet, and seat covered with damask, with little stools to kneel down upon. Bull Dogge says that at one time the prevailing style of pantaloons nearly caused a division in the   church, which was however compromised by an alteration in the litany, and allowing the gentlemen to stand during the performance of certain prayers instead of kneeling down, which latter feat was difficult of accomplishment, on account of- the tightness of their straps. Some of the congregation were however so much offended that they stayed away, and used home-made prayers, instead of coming to church and dealing ina the orthodox ready-made article. Got inside; crowd of people; minister fenced up in a kind of back closet, in a pulpit trimmed with red velvet and gilt-edged prayer-books. Pretty soon, music-organ-sometimes grand and solemn, but generally fast and lively enough for a contra-dance. (B. D. said the player got a big salary to show off the organ, and draw a big house.) He commenced to play Old Hundred (Damphool suggests Ancient Century). At first, majestic as it should be, but soon his left hand began to get unruly among the bass notes, then the right cut up a few monkey shines in the treble; left threw in a large assortment of quavers, right led off with a grand flourish and a few dozen varia- tions; left struggled manfully to keep up, but soon  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC8054-00000067"/> 126       DESTIC K S. gave out, dead beat, and after that went back to first principles, and hammered away religiously at Old Hundred, in spite of the antics of its fellow; right struck up a march, marched into a quick step, quick- ened into a gallop; left still kept at Old Hundred; right put in all sorts of fantastic extras, to entice the"d left from its sense of propriety; left still unmoved; right put in a few bars of a popular waltz; left wavers a little ; right strikes up a-favorite polka; left evidently yielding; right dashes into a jig; left now fairly deserts its colors and goes over to the enemy, and both commence an animated hornpipe, leaving poor Old Hundred to take care of itself. Then with a crash, a squeak, a rush, a roar, a rum- ble, and an expiring groan, the overture concluded and service began. First, a prayer; then a response; prayer; res- ponse; by the priest and people alternately, like the layers of bread and butter, and ham and mustard in a sandwich; then a little sing, then a little preach, then more petitions and more responses. Damphool read the entire service, Minister's cues included, and isung all the hymns. I noticed that Bull Dogge gave all the responses with a great deal of energy and vigor. He said he always liked to    "OOKS ABOUT HM.       127 come to this kind of Church, because when they jawed religion at himn, he could jaw back.

(Bull Dogge offers to bet hi hat, she don't know a cabbage from a new cheese and can't tell whether a sirloin steak is beef, chicken or fresh fish.) At length, with another variette upon the organ and all the concentrated praise and thanksgiving of the congregation, sung by four people up stairs, the service concluded. I thought from the manner of 'this last performance, each member of the choir ima- gined the songs of praise would never get to Heaven if he didn't give them a personal boost, in the shape of an extra yell.   CONCLUSIONS.        129 Left the Church with a confused idea that the only way to attain eternal bliss, is to go to Church every Sunday, and to give liberally to the Foreign Mission- ary cause. BnlBll Dogge tried to convince me, that one half the people present, thought that Fifth avenue runs straight' into Heaven, and that their through tickets are in- sured, their front seats reserved, and that when they are obliged to leave this world, they will find a coach and four, and two servants in livery, ready to take them right through to the other side of Jordan.  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC8054-00000069"/> XVI. resbeanw  But Waf^Ci6 anota&amp;U 6tatinfu   WAS so much affected by the services of the eW Church, had my feelings so much excited, and all my benevolent and charitable nature so thorough- ly aroused by the sermon, that I felt an irresistible desire to rush out and give somebody something. For I know that I am charitable; I feel it in my bones, like rheumatism. I always give money to the begwoman, who has such a large family at home; and to the whiny boy, with a club-foot, who asks - charity in behalf of his sick mother. True, I have seen the old lady when she was evi- dently inebriated, and apparently disposed to harangue the crowd in high Dutch--but then she, was in excellent company; noble-looking men, with stars on their bosoms--and I have discovered that -the club-footed boy changes all his money into cents,   GOES TO A BALL.       131 and gambles it away, playing "pitchpenny" in Theatre-alley; still, I keep on giving. But it is also a fact that I am not always able to comply with the demands upon my purse. Twice have I been invited to " calico" parties, and at the bottom of each note was a modest request that I - would make my appearance arrayed in such apparel only, as I would be willing to donate next day to the Five-Points Mission. Could have done like the others-bought a ready- made coat and vest and given them  with the greatest pleasure-but the hint in the invitation seemed to include the entire wardrobe brought into requisition on the occasion, and when I thought of a Five-Points darkey in my ruffled shirt and gold studs, I was " suddenly indisposed," and sent my " regrets." But I did go to a ball for the benefit of the poor- a two-dollar commingling of " upper-tendom" with "Iower-twentvdom"--an avalanche of exclusiveness, in a torrent of mobocracy-where the crowd was so\ great that faces lost their identity, and I was only conscious of a hustling mass of dressed up humanity -a forest of broadcloth wrecked in an ocean of calico. I barely escaped with life, and reached home in a state of collapse.  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC8054-00000070"/> 132       DO E STI C 3S. Afterward, went to a concert in behalf of the poor -where I sat all the evening in a hard seat with a number on the back, to see a woman make faces at a well-dressed audience, and sing music which I could not understand--the people all applauded when she screamed, and threw bouquets at her when she made a noise like a swamp-blackbird. But after listening to the stirring address before alluded to, I felt that I had not done enough; so, obedient t the promptings of my impulsive nature, I determined to give something more, and being so far cityfled in my habits that I desired to combine amusement with charity, and only give my money to the needy after I had received its worth in dancing, got its full value in foreign music at a high price, or eaten its equivalent in oysters and ice-cream at some kind of a pseudo-charitable gathering, I looked about me for some fitting opportunity to bestow my charity on the deserving poor, after making it previously pay for some delectation for myself. It did not take me long to find out that there was soon to be a ladies' fair, in aid of the poor, given by the benevolent ladies of the Church of the Holy Poker.   ATTENDS A FAIR.       133 Damphool (who can't give up city associations, and who wouldn't read his Bible if it wasn't printed in New York) had sent to me-from  his, rural solitude to procure him a dressing-gown, a pair of slippers, and a crocheted worsted comforter. Thought I couldn't have a better opportunity to purchase these, and so I went to the fair. Got to the hall, paid my twenty-five cents at the door, went in--saw plenty of long tables, with ladies behind them playing "keep store"-tables covered with mysterious articles of baby linen, and complicated pieces of female harness, designed for uses to me unknown, and also all sorts of imprac- ticable unnecessaries intended for gentlemen. Slippers that you couldn't get on; smoking caps that could never, by any possibility, fit anybody (shaped like a Chinese pagoda, and full of tinsel and spangles to make them prickly); cigar cases, that you couldn't get a cigar into without breaking both ends off (perhaps they expect us to smoke "stubs," like the newsboys); pin-cushions, stuffed so hard they would turn the point of a marlin-spike; watch cases, just big enough to hold a three cent piece; pen wipers, that fill the point of a pen full of wool--and, divers other nonsensical inconve-   &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC8054-00000071"/> 134       DOESTIOKS. niences fabricated by speculating females, the pat- terns being always very short, and the stitches very long (I suppose they think we don't know the difference), to palm off upon victimized gentlemen; and, these latter resignedly submit to a price so exorbitant, that if a Chatham-street Israelite had the impudence to ask it they'd straighten out his fish-hook nose like a darning needle. The prettiest looking girls are always placed where the least attractive-looking merchandise is displayed, and they ask the biggest kind of prices, trusting to the gallantry of the gentlemen "not to beat them down," flattering themselves, I suppose, that their pretty looks are " value received " for the exchange. One consequence of this arrangement is, that every buyer spends all the- money he has in his purse, taking in exchange therefor a lot of stuff so utterly useless, and so ridiculously absurd, that after having it on his table for a week or so to laugh at, he is fain to get rid of the rubbish, by giving the whole to his chamber-maid. Sometimes your purchases will hold together till you leave the room, and sometimes not; you must show yourself a man, and " equal to either fortune." There was a post-office; pretty girl called me;    SOLICITED. D        135 had a letter for me; bought it; paid ten cents; nothing in it-blank. Solicitous young lady very anxious to have me give her twenty-five cents to tell me how much I weighed; paid her the money, and she told me within fifty-one pounds and a half. Young woman wanted me to invest in the " grab bag;" gave half a dollar, and fished in; got, in three times trying, a tin whistle, half a stick of candy, and a peanut done up in tissue paper. Went on to the auction table, where, after-much competition with a ringleted miss (who was put there to make Peter Funk bids against probable purchasers), succeeded in bidding in a China vase, I which I soon discovered had a hole in the bottom, and wouldn't hold water any more than it would bake pork. If I had bought it anywhere else should have thought I had been swindled, and have demanded my money back, but here I supposed it was an exemplification of some newly discovered principle of fair dealing with which I was not yet acquainted. Was much amused with the way they disposed of the unsold goods-certain number of articles, (things left at the tables tended by the homely girls) and for :  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC8054-00000072"/> 136       DOES TICKS. each article twenty tickets were put into a hat,whence they were drawn out singly, and the last tickets drawn were to have the prizes--should have thought it was just the same as a lottery, if I had not been acquainted with the ladies, and known they wouldn't do anything so naughty. Came to a place. where an old lady, with steel spectacles, was cutting up a loaf of cake into par, ticularly small pieces-asked what it meant-was told there was a gold ring somewhere in the cake, and they proposed to sell each piece for a quarter of a dollar, and give the ring to the lucky buyer-won- dered if it wasn't another lottery on a small scale, but supposed it couldn't be-went to the supper-room. It is a curious metropolitan fact, that at parties, balls, or wherever a refreshment-table is spread, every man seems to regard it as his duty to fill him- self to the very lips with all the " delicacies of the season," and to accomplish it in the least time possible-as if he was a gun, and anxious to ascer- tain his calibre, and find out how quickly he could be loaded in case of necessity. And the ladies are not far behind; this evening I learned how much a female can eat in a charitable cause.   MAKES AN INVESTMENT.       137 A pale-faced ball-room belle is a modern Sphinx -a gastronomic problem, whose solution will pro- bably never be satisfactorily expounded. Under the impression that she would not eat more than I had money to pay for, I invited a lady to take some refreshments, and I certainly think that, like the countryman, she imagined she was bound to eat all the bill-of-fare called for. She ate-stewed oysters--fried oysters-boiled tur- key with oyster sauce, celery-oysters on the shell -ice cream, sponge cake, and Charlotte russe- Roman punch, two water-ices, coffee, sandwiches, cold sausage, lobster salad, oysters broiled, also stewed again, and six on the shell-orange jelly, grape ditto, cake; she then hinted again at oysters, but as the supply had run out, she was obliged to go hungry-paid the bill with a certified check on the Merchants' Bank, which luckily covered the amount, and greatly relieved -my mind; for I feared there would be a balance which I would have to give my note for. Having previously procured the articles required for my friend, I immediately left-go home-got there, and proceeded to examine my purchases- fomund that the slippers-having been pasted together I  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC8054-00000073"/> 138       DOESTICKS.       - without the slightest regard to permanency, had come apart in my pocket, my comforter had ravelled out, so that I had about six inches comforter, and a wad of yarn big enough to make a horse blanket--my dressing-gown had been made of a moth-eaten rem- nant, and where there was any sewing, every stitch was as long as a railroad, but the sleeves had, I verily believe, been put in with court plaster, and the long seams closed with carpenter's glue. Made up my mind that the objects of that femi- nine institution, a Ladies'- Fair, are somewhat as follows: ..        * Firstly, to give the ladies an opportunity to show their 'new clothes, and to talk with a multitude of unknown gentlemen, without any preliminary intro- duction.  Secondly, to beg as much moneyas possible from the gentlemen aforesaid, under the transparent formality of bargain and sale-which sale includes the buyer, who is really the only article fairly "sold" in the whole collection. Thirdly, to give some money to the ostentatiously poor, if there is any left after paying expenses, and the Committee don't spend it in carriage-hire. In New York, by a refinement. in Benevolence,   MEDITATE S.        139 engendered by the hardness of the times, and the necessity of making the money go as far as it will, charity money answers a double purpose; procuring pleasure for the rich, and soup for the poor. Thus if you pay three dollars for a ticket to the Opera or Ball, you can enjoy your Aria, or Schot- tische, with a double relish; and can eat oysters and turkey, and gulp down creams and ices till your stomach "strikes," in the labor of love, with the happy consciousness, that it is all for " sweet charity" -and if the three dollars, before it reach the needy, in whose behalf you gave it, dwindles to three dimes and a fip, you can, knowing you have done your duty, poetically exclaim, with the noble Thane, "Thou can'st not say I did it."  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC8054-00000074"/> I+suMi t thy ite      't ^m      N company with many others of the same genus and who may be classed under the same general A cognomen, my friend Damphool lately became con- vinced that according to the comfortable prediction of, Mr. Miller, the "end of Earth" would become speedily visible to the naked eye, as that amiable gentleman i had advertised the world to burn on the nineteenth day of May, 1855.

Damphool squared up his board bill, and paid his washerwoman, which left him dead broke; sold his watch to a " blaspheming Jew" to raise money with which to procure an ascension robe; in order to do honor to the occasion, he got one made of linen cambric; it was a trifle too long, and cut him ma- lignantly under the arms, but he bore it like a mar- tyr; he got shaved, took a bath, put on his robe, bid me farewell, and got ready to go up.

Red-haired woman made her appearance with a crying baby, to the consternation of the company, I who expected to go to Heaven, and had no relish for a preliminary taste of the other place. Careful old lady, brought her overshoes in a work- basket, to wear home in case the performance should be postponed.   - - Little girl, had her doll, and her three year old brother had a hoop, a tin whistle, and a painted kite.

Sixth Avenue lady came in a white satin robe; had a boy to hold up her train, and she had her own hands full of visiting cards. An African brunette carried a cushion for- her.

Crowd began to separate into knots, according to their different creeds and beliefs ; Unitarians, Bap- tists, Presbyterians, and Methodists, clustering round their respective preachers. I noticed that one old lady, evidently believing in the perfect sanctity of her darling minister, and desiring to insure her own passage, had tied herself to his left leg with a fish line. Baptist man was preaching close communion. Presbyterian man was descanting on the account- ability of infants, and asserting that a child three years old can commit sufficient sin to doom it to the lowest hell. Sunrise-all knelt down to pray; east wind blew, and it began to rain. I noticed that Damphool had found a dry place on the lee side of a cider barrel.

Baptist man inserted a special clause in his sup- plication, that he and his crowd might go up in a  separate boat. Ministers all prayed at each other, andfor nobody. Know-Nothing clergyman addressed a long-winded political prayer to the Almighty, detailing the latest election returns, deploring the choice of the opposition candidate, imploring his blessing on the next governor (if the world should stand), insinuated that he expected the nomination himself, and con- cluded by advising Him to exclude from heaven all  foreigners, or they would refuse to live up to the regulations, and would certainly kick up another row among the celestials. Down-town man, on hand, ready to go up; tried to pray, but from want of practice, could- only utter some disjointed sentences about " uncurrent funds," "money market," "Erie down to 36 ;" (Damphool whispered that if that man ever got to heaven he would melt down the golden harp into coin, and let it out at two per cent. a month.)

Noon came; folks were not half so scared as they were in the morning; ministers had got too hoarse to talk, and were passing the time kissing the sisters. Damphool looked so chilly that I got him a glass of hot whiskey punch; he looked at me with holy horror, and went on with his prayer, but before he got to " amen," the punch had disappeared. Husband of red-haired woman came and ordered her to go home and wash the breakfast dishes and then mend his Sunday pantaloons. One o'clock, zeal began to cool off'; at two the enthusiasm was below par; at three the rain poured so that I thought an alteration in the Litany would be necessary to make it read, "Have mercy upon us miserable swimmers."

Damphool, much disappointed, muttered something about being "sold;" people evidently getting hungry; no loaves or fishes on the ground; woman with two children said she was going home to put them in the trundle- bed; long man looked round to see that no one was looking, then tucked his robe under his arm, got over the fence, and started for home on a dog trot. Dark; no signs of fireworks yet; pyrotechnic exhibition not likely to commence for some time. Crowd impatient. (I here missed Damphool, and found him an hour afterwards, paying his devotions to an eighteen-penny oyster stew and a mug of ale.) Stayed an hour longer, when the crowd began to disperse, with their ascension robes so sadly draggled, that if they HAD received a second summons to go, it would have taken an extra quantity of soap-suds to make them presentable among decent angels. Appointed myself a committee of five to inquire into the matter; offered the following resolution, which I unanimously adopted:-- Resolved, That putting on a clean shirt to go to heaven in, don't always result in getting there, even *     e   O F ER S A RESOLUT I ON.     147  though the tails be of extra length, and that the creed which teaches such a mode of procedure is a farcical theology, fully worthy to be ranked among the many other excellent "sells" of that veteran joker of world-wide celebrity-Jo Miller. , -h; &#xD;<pb n="148" xml:id="VAC8054-00000078"/> THE only dramatic performances known in the wild region where I passed some of my early years, are given by companies of strolling players who usually give their classic entertainments in the barn, have a piece of carpet for a drop curtain, foii tallow candles for footlights, and who generally go out of town in the night without paying their Tavern bills.  Almost every Drama performed by them, required mere people to represent it than are contained in an entire troupe; the services of a crowd of aspiring country boys are secured for soldiers; citizens, ro bers, and other personages who don't have to ps anything; but there is still a large gap which can only be filled by the " doubling" of several parts by one performer.

I have, always had a passion for theatricals, and was at one time of my variegated existence much -more intimately connected with the stage than at present-and on reaching this city I felt, of course, a great desire to behold again the theatre, with all its brilliant fascinations-the light, the music, the varied scenery comprising gardens, chambers, cot- tages, mountains, 'cloud-capped towers and gor-  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC8054-00000081"/> 152       DOESTICKS.. geous palaces," bar-rooms, churches, huts and hovels -to look again upon the glass jewels, -the tinselled robes of mimic royalty, the pasteboard banquets and molasses wine, and all the glory, " pride, pomp and circumstance" and humbug which I once " knew ,so well," " et quorum magna pars fui f"  So, with my trusty friends, Damphool and Bull Dogge, I wended my way to the Metropolitan Thea-  tre lNo. 1, to see and hear the distinguished Mr. Rantanrave Hellitisplit, the notorious American tra- gedian, in his great, original, unapproachable, incon- ceivable, inexplicable, incomprehensible part of "What a bore O, the last of the Vollypogs." I had heard so much of this great actor in this particular part, that I expected to behold nothing : less than the "Eighth wonder of the world." Opera glasses were continually levelled at us by people who, impelled by a laudable curiosity, were anxious to see all that could be seen. (Damphool says, that when you see a woman with one of these implements, you may be sure she wants to be looked at-and called my attention to the confirmatory fact, that all the ladies with the finest busts, and the best developed forms, wore their dresses the lowest in the neck, and sported the biggest opera glasses). (Bull   O B S E R V A T I ON S.   153 Dogge asserts that they were invented by the author of "Staring made Easy," and "A Treatise on the Use of Globes.") After a season of tramping by the intelligent au- dience, which seemed, by its measured regularity, to intimate that they had learned the motion in the treadmill, the bell jingled and the members of the orchestra entered, one by one. The audience endured the prolonged tuning of the instruments, conducted in a masterly manner by the leader of the band, the music got " good ready" for a fair start, and at the word " go" they went. Could not critically analyse the uproar, but it seemed to be composed of these elements: a predo- minance of drum and cymbals--a liberal allowance of flute and horn-a spasmodic sprinkling of trom- bone-a small quantity of oboe, and a great deal of fiddle. The tumult was directed by the leader, who waved the fiddle over his head, jumped up and down upon his seat, kicked up his heels, disarranged his shirt collar, threw his arms wildly about, stamped, made faces, and conducted himself as if he was dancing a frantic hornpipe for the gratification of the crazy whims of an audience of Bedlamites.

Nothing decisive, however, came to pass until the long-expected entrance of the great Hellitisplit him- self eventuated. I must confess that I was awed by the terrific yet serene majesty, of his appearance. When I saw the tragic, codfishy- expression of his eyes, I was sur- prised ; when I observed the flexibility of his capa- cious mouth, opening and shutting, like a dying mud- sucker, I was amazed. When my eye turned to his fingers, wlhich worked and clutched, as if feeling for coppers in a dark closet, I was wonder-stricken-but when my attention was called to the magnitude of his legs, I was fairly electrified with admiration, and could niot forbear asking Bull Dogge if those calves were capable of locomotion. What-a-bore-O, is supposed to be an Indian Chief, and although it is the prevailing impression that In- dians are beardless, the face of this celebrated per- former proved this opinion to be a physiological fallacy,   AWE STRICKEN.        155 For upon his chin he wore a tuft of hair, a round black hirsute knob, neither useful nor ornamental, but which looked as if somebody had hit him in the face with a blacking-brush, and a piece had stuck to his lower jaw. The admiring audience, who had kicked up per- fect young earthquake when he came on, only ceased when he squared himself, put out his arm and pre- pared to speak. That voice! Ye Gods! that voice! It went through gradations that human voice never before attempted, imitating by turns the horn of the City Hall Gabriel, the shriek of the locomotive, the soft and gentle tones of a forty-horse-power steam saw- mill, the loving accents of the scissor-grinder's wheel, the amorous tones of the charcoal-man, the rumble of the omnibus, the cry of the driver appertaining thereto-rising from the entrancing notes of the in- furiated house-dog to the terrific cry of the oyster -vender-causing the "supes" to tremble in their boots, making the fiddlers look around for some place of safety, and moving the assembled multitude to echo back the roar, feebly, it is true, but-still with all their puny strength.

Several times during the piece I was much affected --when he wound his arms round his wife, stuck his head over her shoulder, and kissed the back of her neck--when he made a grand exit, with three stamps, a hop, a run, and two long straddles-wlien he talked grand about the thunder, shook his fist at the man in the flies-when he killed the soldiers in the council room, shouted forwthem to " come one and all," and then ran away for fear they would-when he swore at the man who did not give him his cue-when he knelt down and said grace over his dead boy, and then got up and stuck his wife with the butcher- knife; but at no part of the whole piece was I so impressed with his pathetic power, his transcendent genius, as when he laid his hand solemnly on his stomach, and said "What a bore, O cannot lie!" (Damphool asked, in a whisper, if Othello's occupa- tion was gone). And at the death scene, when he was shot, I was again touched to the heart; first he wabbled about like a top-heavy liberty pole in a high wind; then he stuck out one leg, and wiggled it, after the man- ner of a galvanic bull-frog; then sat down on the ,   TOUCHED TO TH E HEART.      157 floor, opened his eyes and looked around; then grappled an Indian on one side, clutched a soldier on the other, struggled to his feet, staggered about like a drunken Dutchman, made a rush forwards, then a leap sideways, stiffened out like a frozen pig, col- lapsed like a wet dish-cloth, exerted himself till his face was the color of an underdone beefsteak, then sank back into the arms of the Indians, whispered to let him down easy, rolled up the whites of his eyes, settled himself to die--concluded to have a parting curse at the surrounding people, took a long swear, laid down, and with a noise in his throat like casta- nets, a couple of vigorous kicks and a feeble groan, gave up the ghost. Bull Dogge asserted that he would resuscitate, brush the dust off his legs (take some gin and sugar, and come out and make a speech), all of which he did; the butcher boys in the gallery (Damphool says Hellitisplit commenced life as a respectable butcher- boy, but has degenerated into the man he is,) gave three cheers, Hellitisplit opened his mouth four times, shut it thrice (he went off with it wide open), and backed off with a grace which we may suppose would be exhibited by a mudturtle on the tight- rope.      i 1*    &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC8054-00000084"/> 158       DOES TICKS. Damphool was in ecstacies-Bull Dogge asked me how I liked the " great American;" &amp;c."

E -are all aware that Chatham Street and the Bowery are the legitimate abiding places of those benevolent Hebrews, whose zeal for the public welfare, and pity for ragged humanity, lead them to continually offer their valuable and undoubtedly durable articles of wearing apparel to the needy public " below cost;" and the enviable philosophy with which they bear the "alarming sacrifices" which must daily deplete their ample for- tunes, has often been the subject of wondering remark.

But these Israelitish avenues before mentioned, are not only the headquarters of these philanthropic gentlemen, but are the depot for many other imita- tions of humanity, and curious specimens of human skill unknown to the unobserving.

Some malicious person has recollected that the Joneses did the same thing last year, and his incon- venient and libellous memory has also recalled the circumstance that soon after New Year's, the two daughters of Jones had new silk dresses, and Mrs. J. rejoiced in a new cloak and hat of the richest style, and he says that Brogley, the broker, told him that on the 3rd'of January last, Jones got some "tens" and " twenties " of him in exchange for small money, and made him give him two per cent. over because so much of it was silver change-and, in fact, he insinuates that as the money was to be' "for the poor," Jones voted himself as poor as any body, and kept, the proceeds-and rumor whispers that the Joneses won't have- half so many calls this year as last, because their friends object to being taxed to pay their milliners' bills.

The effect of this arrangement is to impress a stranger with the idea that the owner -of the establishment has been compelled to furnish his drawing-room from the chaotic assortment of a second-hand furniture store. And, notwithstanding the recent election of a Maine Law Governor, in nearly every house, wines, brandy, punches, ".hot stuff," and various inebriat- ing drinks abounded, and every guest was compelled, on pain of slighting his host, to partake-the inevi- table result was, that before night, many a youth, whose head might have withstood the attack of a single bottle, not being able to endure a twenty hours' siege, gave in dead-drunk-while others of harder heads and stronger stomachs, reeled from parlor to parlor, proclaiming the obituary of their respect- ability and decency, by exhibiting the noisy clamor, or idiotic gibber of beastly drunkenness, to the re- fined and polished ladies of "our best society"--in many cases rewarding the pseudo-hospitality of their   OBSERVES THE CALLERS.       175 fair entertainers by liberally'sprinkling the marble steps, to their noble mansions, with an unclean bap- tism from their aristocratic stomachs.

Crowd of young men came in together, (it is cus- tomary here, for young gentlemen to club their funds, hire a carriage by the hour, and go calling in a drove; stopping at every house where one of the company happens to be acquainted ; so that when a lady keeps open house, for every person whom she knows or desires to see, a dozen unknown individuals annoy her by their uninvited presence,)-every one asked tile young ladies to sing, and the young ladies did sing-generally opera, but sometimes varying the entertainment with the touching ballad of "' Old Dog Tray," or the graceful and genteel melody, "Jordan is a Hard Road."

I have no doubt that in the whole city, yesterday, "Norma " must have been entreated to ," hear my prayer," at least fifteen thousand distinct times, by probably five thousand imploring females-and these harmonious supplications, if blended and consoli- dated into one powerfil, entreating scream, would have been sufficient to raise the ancient Druids from I  their graves, only to find that, although the final trump had not sounded, it was by an imitation by no means to be despised, that they had been fooled into a premature resurrection. As evening came on, the guests who. came showed signs of the day's indulgences-I was particularly edified by the movements of three of them, whom I noted with peculiar care-the first shook hands cor- dially with the  servant girl, called her "Mrs. Griggs," wished her many happy returns, and on being told of his error, made an humble apology to 8  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC8054-00000094"/> 178       DOESTI KS. the piano stool, and immediately sat down in a spit- toon.

The third stumbled on to the sofa, and, after steadily contemplating his boots with mich satisfac- tion for fifteen minutes, he picked up a Chinese fire- screen, and with an irresistible drunken sobriety, he tried to decipher the mysterious characters inscribed thereon, at the samg time calling the attention of Mrs. G. to the capital story in " the Magtober num- ber of Harper's Octazine." Refreshments--first man often essaying to wipe his nose with his umbrella, which he afterwards placed in the music rack-poured his coffee into his ice-cream, put his cake and sandwich into its place, stirred them up with a tea-spoon, and tried to drink -the effort resulting in a signal failure, he passed his cup to the clandelier for "a little more sugar."

The other, after carefully depositing his plate on the floor, dropped his gloves into his saucer, and tried to put his over-coat into his vest pocket, made a great attempt to eat his cup of coffee with his knife and fork, and then resolutely set about picking his teeth with the nut-cracker. After some complicated manoeuvring, they bowed themselves out as best they could--but the last one, having mistaken the door and gone down cellar, instead of out-doors, was found next morning reposing complacently in the coal-hole. In fact, New York, every New Year's Eve, goes to bed with a huge brick in its municipal hat, and, as the legitimate effect of such indiscretion, awakes next morning with a tremendous corporate headache --"Young America," for once, is unstarched in appearance; and in, deportment, meek as the suck- ing dove.  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC8054-00000095"/> XXT. ^mIRmIt fort tl^ Slelllim-3 2+4  ^i S- r SLEIGH-RIDING is an amusement to which I was never partial, for I cannot appreciate the- pleasure there is, in a man's deliberately freezing his feet, and congealing his fingers into digital icicles; and for my own part unless there was some unusual charm beyond the ride itself, I would as soon think of seeking an evening's amusement by sitting a given number of hours on a frozen mill pond with my pedal extremities stuck through a hole in the ice into the water below.

Agreed to go, put on my tightest boots, and got ready-time came, sleigh arrived, got in, received a promiscuous introduction to 'seventeen young ladies, by the light of a street lamp. Couldn't of course distinguish their faces so as to tell them apart, and so was continually calling Miss Jones, Miss Snifkins; Miss Loodle, Miss Vanderpants; and addressing Miss Faubob and Miss Wiggins by each other's names; which, as they were ready to scratch each other's eyes out for jealousy, and hadn't been on speaking terms for a year and a half, made the matter decidedly pleasant. Found a place for my feet among the miscella- neous pedal assortment at the bottom-sat down, held on with both hands, and prepared to enjoy myself. After a great deal of whipping of the spirited horses, and some curiously emphatic observations by the driver, we got under way.

Met a charcoal cart, run against us and distributed a shower of pulverized nigritude over the company, to the great damage of the clean linen of the gentle- men, and the adornments generally of the ladies, especially those little white rosettes which they had tied on the backs of their heads, and dignified with the fabulous title of bonnets. Met a stage sleigh, got jammed with us--and during the three minutes preceding our violent extrication, I had leisure to take par'tieular notice of the inmates. Now, even in ordinary times, any kind of an omnibus is a purely democratic institution, but an omnibus sleigh containing ordinarily, anywhere from fifty to a hundred and twenty people, is a most effectual leveller of aristocratic distinctions. 8* i  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC8054-00000098"/> 186       DO E ST 1CK S.

The only way to get an ordinary city girl really interested in a dance, is to have some moustachoed puppy put his arm round her waist, hug her close up to him, spin her round the room till her head swims.

THE State of Michigan having been the place of my preparation for College, and the Michigan University the scene of my brilliant though prema- ture graduation, I was not wholly unacquailted with occidental geography. As I entered the Institution just mentioned, broke'the rules, was tried, convicted, sentenced, punished, fined, suspended, and expelled in an unprecedented short space of time, no one was more fully prepared than I to admit that " this is a great country." I was somewhat familiar with the entire country known as " out west;" had rode over it, walked over it, and been shot through it by steam; had stopped at all sorts of public-houses from the stylish hotel where you can get your liquor in glass tumblers, have stairs to get to your room with, and can repose on a bedstead, to the unostentatious tavern where   IN KENTUCKY.         201' the whiskey is served out in a tin dipper, and you have to climb into the garret by -a ladder, and sleep on a bundle of straw, under the populous protection of a horse-blanket. But I never so thoroughly under- stood the discomforts of living atra hotel, as when on one occasion I strayed into the state of Kentucty, the land of good horses, poor jackasses, glorious corn-bread, and lazy darkies, and stopped at the best house of entertainment I could discover. Having been thoroughly cooked by the broiling sun, which had unremittingly paid me his ardent devotions during the whole day--having been alter- nately melted and blistered-having had my skin peeled by the sun like a wet shirt from alittle boy's back-having made a perfect aqueduct of myself for twelve hours in the fruitless attempt to -keep cool, and having swallowed so much dust that I had a large sand-bar in my stomach, I sat down to write in as enviable a stated of mind as can perhaps be imagined. I soon found that this was one of those stranger-traps into which unwary travellers are decoyed, and made to pay enormous prices for being rendered supremely unhappy--a place where com- fort is mercilessly sacrificed to 8how-where the furniture is too nices to use, the landlord of too much  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC8054-00000106"/> 202       DOESTIOKS, consequential importance to treat people decently, and where there are so many dishes on the table that there is not room for anything to eat-where the waiters run in multitudinous directions at the tap of the bell, and seem to. occupy most of their time stepping on each other's heels, and spilling soup into the laps of the ladies. Every one of these woolly- headed nuisances expects to be handsomely feed before he will condescend to pay the slightest atten- tion to a guest, and a stranger must disburse an avalanche of "bits," " pics," and " levys," before he can get even a plate of cold victuals. My experience at the house of entertainment at present under consideration is somewhat as follows: I endure the inconveniences of the day with what philosophy I may, and retire, to " sleep, perchance."' During the night I endeavor to bear without com- -plaining the savage onslaught of ferocious fleas, the odoriferous attacks of bloodthirsty bed-bugs, and the insatiable and impetuous assaults of musically mur- derous mosquitoes, and eventually fall into a troubled, doze, in which, like a modern Macheth, who is doomed to " sleep no more," I tumble about until I am roused by the infernal clang of that most diabo- lical of all human contrivances--a gong, a dire          ,    .

After an abortive attempt to- wash my face in what is truly living water, with a piece of marbleized soap, and hastily drying it upon three inches of towel with a ragged edge and iron rust in the corners, I proceed to dress. Button off my shirt neck, which, being a matter of course, does not affect my equanimity half as much as finding that one of the sleeves is torn nearly across, and is only connected with the main body by a narrow isthmus of seam, which is 'momentarily growing " small by degrees and beautifully less."

Pours out a lukewarm muddy mixture supposed to have been originally coffee, which I sweeten with niggery brown sugar, and swallow at a gulp, ignoring the milk pitcer entirely on account of the variety of bugs which Wave found a " watery grave" therein; bread hard ail greasy, butter oily and full of little ditches where the flies have meandered, knife with an edge like a saw, and fork with a revolving handle, table cloth splotchy, eggs hard as pebbles; rest of bill of fare consists of salt ham, red flannel sausages, hash with hairs in it, dip-toast made with sour milk, burned -bscuit, peppery codfish, cold potatoes, mutton chops all bones, and mackerel with head, fins, and tail complete. Stay my stomach with half a glass of equivocal looking water, and exit. Go to the office and order my room regulated immediately; go up in an hour and find two inches of dust over everything, my portfolios untied, books open at the wrong place, tooth-brush out and wet, and several long red hairs in my comb.

Passengers elegantly disposed in various stages of don't-care-a-cent-itiveness, and the subscrib- er, taking advantage of the temporary sobriety of the clerk, and his consequent attendance inpthe after- cabin to play poker with the mates, embraces tWe opportunity to write. The silence is of brief dura- tion, for I am interrupted by a grand oratorio by the nigger firemen, much to my delight and edification. It runs somewhat: as follows:-  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC8054-00000111"/> 210       DOEBTI O S. (Grand opening chorus) "A-hoo--a-hoo-hoo- oooo-a-hooo -a-hoo-a-hooo-a-hoooo-oo!"

Captain here interferes and orders the orchestra to wod up-and so interrupts the concert.                 i Have, got over on the Indiana side, principal differ- ence to be noticed in the inhabitants is in the hogs; on the Kentucky side they are big, .fat, and as broad as they are long; on this side they are shaped like a North river steamboat, long and lean. I just saw two of 'em sharpen their noses on the pavement, and engage in mortal combat; one rushed at his neighbor, struck him between the eyes, split him-from end to end; cart came along, run over the two halves, cut them into hams -and shoul- ders in a jiffy-reguiesaft in many pieces. This is decidedly a rich country; the- staple productions are big hogs, ragged niggers, and the best horses in the United States. The people live principally on bread 9  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC8054-00000112"/> 212       DOESTICKS. made of corn; whisky ditto; and hog prepared in various barbarous ways. They give away whisky and sell cold water. The darkies are mostly slaves; they nail horseshoes over their doors to keep away the witches, indulge in parti-colored hats in the most superlative degree of dilapidation, go barefooted, and have large apertures " in puppes pantalooni." It is a perfect treat to watch their entertaining per- formances. At the hotel the allowance is fourteen niggers to each guest, and as each one seems to be possessed of the peculiar idea that his province is to do nothing at all, with-as many flourishes as possible, the confusion that follows is far from being devoid of entertainment.  They never bring you anything you call 'for; if you ask for chicken, you will probably get corned- beef and cabbage; if you want roast beef, they will assuredly bring you apple dumplinags; ask for sweet potatoes, and you'll get fried eggs; send for corn bread, and you're safe to obtain boiled pork; ring the bell for a boo{ jack, and you'll get a hand-sled.

There is, however, one redeeming feature about the darkies, they won't live in the same country with Irishmen. They can live with hogs, have half a dozen shoats at the dinner-table, a litter of pigs in the family bed, but they can't abide Irish. The slaves are, as may be imagined, of various colors, ranging from the hue of the beautiful yellow envelope of the Post Office Department, to that of the blackest ink that ever indites a superscription thereon.  The theory of "woman's rights" is in practical operation among them; the men cook, set the table, clean up the dishes, do the washing, and spank the babies, while their blacker halves hoe corn, chop wood, go to market, and "run wid de masheen."

To return to the principal topic-the darkies- they are all built after the same model; hand like a shoulder of mutton, teeth white as milk, foot of suit- able dimensions for a railroad bridge, and mouth big enough for the depot; have all got six toes on each foot, skull like an oak plank, yellow eyes, and nose like a split pear. -          .

At length, however, I began to feel a longing for the green curtain again; and feeling time hang heavy on my hands from the fact that I had an entire evening at my own disposal, I held a great consulta- tion with my inseparable friends, on the most feasible and agreeable method of sacrificing the great horo- logical enemy. After mature deliberation, we resolved to visit the lately established, ":truly gorgeous temple of the 'muses,' ," and witness the redemption of one of the pledges of the Directors, who had promised us the  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC8054-00000114"/> 216       DOESTICKS. restoration of the legitimate classic drama. We believed that there we should find " true artistic taste, displayed in the adornment and decoration of the building," and that we should see "sterling plays acted by performers of the highest merit; where every attention would be paid to propriety and elegance of costume, and splendor and magnifi- cence of stage appointments." We took a stage and navigated up Broadway until we came opposite Bond street, to the place where a big canvas sign marks the entrance to the "Gracnd Thespian Wigwam, and -Head Quarters of Modern \ Orpheus." Through a wedge-shaped. green-baize door-down a crooked pair of stairs--under an overhanging arch -and we stood in the parquette. Took a front seat, and immediately had occasion to commend the economy of the managers in not lighting the gas in the upper boxes-then proceeded to admire in detail the many beauties of this superb edifice, which, at first glance, reminded me of an overgrown steamboat cabin. Looked for a long time at the indefinite Indian over the stage, trying to fix the gender to my satis-- faction, and decide whether it is a squaw or an indi-   "OOKS ABOUT HM.        217 vidual of masculinity-hard to tell, for it has the face, form, and anatomical developments of the former, and the position and hunting implements of the latter-I concluded that it must be an original Woman's Rights female, who, in the lack of breeches, had taken possession of the "traps " of her copper- colored lord and master, and, getting tired of the unusual playthings, had lain down to take a snooze. Admired the easy and graceful drapery painted on the a drop," which looks as if it was whittled out of a pine shingle-took a perplexed view of the assorted landscape depicted thereon--endeavored to reconcile the Turkish ruins with the Swiss mountains, or the Gothic castle with the Arab slaves-wanted to har- monize the camels and other tropical quadrupeds on the right, with the frozen mill-pond on the left- couldn't understand why the man on the other side of the same, among the distant mountains, should be so much larger than the individual close to the shore, who is supposed to be nearer by several miles. Tried to make out what the man in a- turban is doing with his legs crossed under him, on a raft, but gave it up-admired exceedingly the two- rows of private boxes, which looked like windows in a mar- tin-house, but cpuld not perceive the propriety of  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC8054-00000115"/> 218       DOESTI C:KS. having them supported by plaster of paris ladies, without any arms, and their bodies covered up in patent metallic burial-cases. (I was informed that the artist calls them Carydtides.) Was impressed with the admirable proportions of the stage; a hundred and eleven feet wide, 'by four feet ten inches deep--reminded me forcibly of an empty seidlitz-powder box, turned up edgeways- censured the indelicacy of the managers in permit- ting the immodest little cupids, who tacitly perform on the impossible lutes and fiddles, to appear before so refined an' audience, "all in their bare "-(my friend says the drapery was " omitted by particular request.") Was much chagrined about a mistake I made concerning a picture on one of the proscenium flats, which I mistook for a Kentucky biokwobds girl, with a bowie-knife in one hand and a glass of corn-whiskey in the other; but I was told that it represents the tragic muse, with the dagger and poison bowl. Resolved not to be deceived about the match picture on the other side, and after an attentive scrutiny, I determined that it is either a female rag- picker with a scoop-shovel, or a Virginia wench with a hoe-cake in her hand; and I made up my mind ,  .

Accordingly, Ive been to the Bowery Thea- tre-the realm of orange-peel and peanuts-the legitimate home of the unadulterated, undiluted san- guinary drama--the school of juvenile Jack-Shep- pardism, where adolescent "shoulder hitters" and politicians in future take their first lessons in row- dyism. Where the seeds of evil are often first planted in the rough bosom of the uncared-for boy, and, deve- loped by the atmosphere of this moral hot-house, soon blossom into crime. Where, by perverted dramatic skill, wickedness is clothed in the robes of romance and pseudo-heroism.   O B S E RV AT IONS.    229 so enticingly as to captivate the young imagination, and many a mistaught youth goes hence into the world with the firm belief that to rival Dick Turpin or Sixteen-String Jack is the climax of earthly honor. A place where they announce a grand " benefit" five nights in- the week, for the purpose of cutting off the free-list, on which occasions the performance lasts till the afternoon of the next day. Where the newsboys congregate to see the play, and stimulate, with their discriminating plaudits, the "star" of the evening. For this is the spawning-ground of theatrical luminaries unheard-of in other spheres; men who having so far succeeded in extravagant buffoonery, or in that peculiar kind of serious playing which may be termed mad-dog tragedy, as to win the favor of this audience, forthwith claim celestial honors, and set up as " stars." And a star benefit-night at this establishment is a treat; the beneficiary feasts the whole company after the performance,-:and they hurry up their work as fast as possible so as to begin their jollification at the nearest tavern; they have a'preliminary good time behind the scenes with such viands' and potables as admit of hurried consumption.  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC8054-00000121"/> 230       DOESTICKS. So that while the curtain is down, Lady Macheth and the witches may be seen together drinking strong-beer, and devouring crackers and cheese; and after Macheth has murdered Duncan, and Mac- duff has finished Macheth, they all three take a "whisky skin," and agree to go fishing next Sun- day.         J The "Stranger" plays a pathetic scene, rushes from the stage in a passion of tears, and is discovered the next minute eating ham sandwiches and drink- ing Scotch ale out of the bottle-or Hamlet, after his suicidal soliloquy, steps off, and, as the curtain descends upon the, act, dances a hornpipe .with a ballet-girl, while the Ghost whistles the tune and beats time with an oyster-knife. But the Bowery audiences are, in their own fashion, critical, and will have everything, before the curtain, done to suit their taste. An actor must do his utmost, and make things ring again; and wo be to him who dares, in a fero- cious struggle, a bloody combat, or a violent death, to abate one single yell, to leave out one bitter curse, or omit the tithe of a customary contortion. He will surel rue his presumption, for many a comba- tant has teen forced to renew an easily -won broad-   OBSERVATIONS.        231 sword combat, adding fiercer blows, and harder stamps--and many a performer who has died too comfortably, and too much at his ease to suit his ex- acting audience, has been obliged to do it all over again, with the addition of extra jerks, writhings, flounderings, and high-pressure spasms, until he has "died the death" set down for him. An actress, to be popular at this theatre, must be willing to play any part, from Lady Macheth to Betsey Baker--sing a song, dance a jig, swallow a sword, ride a bare-backed horse, fight with guns, lances, pistols, broadswords, and single-sticks--walk the tight-rope, balance a ladder on her nose, stand on her head, and even throw a back-sumlnerset. She must upon occasion play male parts, wear pan- taloons, smoke cigars, swear, swagger, and drink raw-whiskey without making faces. The refined taste which approbates these qualifica- tions is also displayed in the selection of dramas suitable for their display. Shakspeare, as a general thing, is too slow.' Richard III. might be endured, if they would bring him a horse when he calls for it, and let him fight Richmond and his army single- handed, and finally shoot himself with a revolver, rather than give, up beat. r.  /  *  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC8054-00000122"/> 232       DOESTICKS. Macheth could only expect an enthusiastic wel- come, if all the characters were omitted but the three witches and the ghost of Banquo; but usually nothing but the most slaughterous tragedies and melo-dramas of the most mysterious and sanguinary stamp, give satisfaction. A tragedy hero is-a milk-sop, unless he rescues some forlorn maiden from an impregnable castle, carries her down a forty-foot ladder in his arms, holds her with one hand, while with the other he an- nihilates a score or so of pursuers, by picking up - one by the heels, and with him knocking out the brains of all the rest, then springs upon his hoise, leaps him over'a precipice, rushes him up a moun- tain, and finally makes his escape with his prize amid a tempest of bullets, Congreve rockets, Greek fire and bomb-shells. Thus it may be supposed that no ordinary mate- rials will furnish stock for a successful Bowery play. Probabilities, or even improbable possibilities, are too tame. Even a single ghost to enter in a glare of blue light, with his throat cut, and a bloody dagger in his breast, and clanking a dragging chain, would be too common-place. When the boys are in the chivalric vein, and dis-   READS THE BILL,       233 posed to relish a hero, to content -them he must be able, in defence of distressed maidens, (the Bowery boys are ragged knights-errant in their way, and greatly compassionate forlorn damsels,) to circum- vent and destroy a small-sized army, and eat the captain for luncheon. If they are in a murderous mood, nothing less than a full-grown battle, with a big list of killed and wounded, will satisfy-their thirst for blood; and if they fancy a touch of the ghastly, nothing will do but new-made graves, coffins, corpses, gibbering ghosts, and grinning skeletons. I went by the old, damaged, " spout-shop" the other day-saw a big bill for the evening, and stopped to read-magnificent entertainment-to commence with a five-act tragedy, in which the hero is pursued to the top of a high mountain, and after slaying multitudes of enemies, he is swallowed up by an earthquake, mountain and all, just in time to save his life.

Skratch would display her agility by leaping through' a'balloon over a pyramid, composed of a hose truck, two beer barrels, and a mountain of green fire. 'Numberless other things were promised, in the shape -of Firemen's addresses, songs, legerdemain, acrobatic exercises, ventriloquism, &amp;c., the whole to conclude with an original Extravaganza, in which the whole company would appear. I paid my money, and got inside. A great many straight-up-and-down red-faced ladies were in "the boxes, with cotton gloves on, and bonnets so small' you couldn't tell they had any at all unless you went behind and took -a tear view,-and a multitude of men who chewed a great deal of tobacco, and sat- with their hats on; a policeman stood in front of the stage, and made a great deal of noise with a cane, and constituted himself a nuisance generally. 9         Y   DESCRIBES THE COMPANY.-      235 The Pit, the dominion of the newsboys, was full of these young gentlemen, in their shirt-sleeves, with boots too big, and caps perched on the extreme supporting point of the head (the New York news- boy always puts his cap on the back ofhis neck, and pulls all his hair over his eyes), who were re- markably familiar and easy in their manners, and all had bobtailed appellations; no boy had a whole name any more than a whole suit of clothes; nothing more than Bob or Bill, with an adjective prefixed, which transformed it into "Cross-eyed Bob," or "Stub-legged Bill." They enjoyed the performances much; they cheer- ed the tragedy man when he howled like a mad-bull, and hammered his stomach with both hands; ap- plauded the injured maiden when she told the "villain," " another step, and she would lay himn a corpse at her feet," at the same time showing a dagger about as big as a darning-needle, and also; when in despair at being deserted by the fellow in the yellow boots, in a spangled nightgown, she ,poisoned herself with something out of a junk-bottle, and expired in satisfactory-chnvulsions, They threw apples at the man who walked uip the rope) and tossed peanuts on the stage when the girl s..10*  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC8054-00000124"/> a36       DOEB ST IOT S. with the foggy dress was going to dance; they called the actors by their names as they came on the stage, audibly criticising their dress and manner, the per- formers-often joining in the conversation-one nstant talking heroic poetry to some personage of the scene, and the next inquiring of Jake, in the pit, how he would trade his bull-terrier for a fighting-cock and a pair of pistols. I stayed all night and watched the fun-began to -. hungry-audience all tired, and actors asleep on the stage from. sheer exhaustion-the noisy police- man was leaning against the orchestra railing fast asleep-the boys had blacked his face with a burnt cork, filled his boots full of peanut-shells, and cut a hole in his hat to put a candle in; those boys who were awake-were pulling the boots off the sleepy onts, and putting them into the bass drum through a hole which they had punched with a crutch. OGn the stage the Emperor was sleeping on his throne, with his mouth open like a fly-trap--the ' injured lady" had sunk flat down upon the floor- a robber lay each side--she was using the 1" villain" as a pillow, and had her feet tangled in the hair of the "Amber Witch," who was sleeping near.

Bull Dogge accompanied me and we followed our directions to a dot. After standing in the cold till our jaws rattled like a dice-box, a person in a long cloak appeared. I whi pered "Yankee," Shanghae-like he responded "Doodle," and arm-in-arm we started. We went through a long series of lanes, alleys, stair-cases, up ladders, and through cellars, and at last came to an out-of-the-way room which we could only enter by climbing up a two-inch rope and crawling on our hands and knees on the roof about half a block, then letting ourselves down through the garSt-window. Immediately on our entering the room, I was se'ed- by several men, blind-folded by having a red liberty-cap pulled over my eyes, and gagged with the butt-end of a Yankee flag-staff. Soon a gruff voice pronounced the mystic words, '0of -with the night-cap." The cap was hastily removed, when the same voice continued, "let there be light."   INITIATED         243 It was undoubtedly the intention to ihave a bril- liant illumination immediately follow this command, that the opening scenes of the initiation might be grand and impressive.      v The solemnity of the thing was, however, sadly interfered with- by having bad lucifer matches which would not take fire, notwithstanding the active exertions and "curses not lolud" but still audible, of the member who was striving to ignite the same by rubbing them on the sole of his boot, in which endeavor he broke them all in two, and split his finger nails on the pegs in his heels. After some delay, however, "there was light," and then I discovered my situation.  In a long room, a wooden statue of tie Goddess of Liberty, at one end; a picture of La Fayette, with a cocked hat on, at the other; and a man in -a pulpit in the middle, dressed up to represent Washington, in a revolutionary uniform, with his hair powdered,- and a sword in his hand. As I approached- him he gave me a goblin wink with his left eye, shook his fist at me solemnly, and began to question me- con- cerning 'my nativity., Told'him I was a full born Yankee,- that the sight of an Englishman makes me mad and fighty, that I wanted to kick every French- .     &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC8054-00000128"/> man who comes in my path, and to trip up every Dutchman, and that even the most distant glimpse of an Irishman makes me sick at the stomach. Said he thought rd do, and told the rest to put me'through the sprouts. They wrapped me in an American flag, made me kneel down before the white oak goddess of Liberty and solemnly swear hatred to the Pope, the aboli- tionists, and the king of England, death and destruc- tion to all foreigners, and eternal fidelity to "Sam ;" that I never would employ Irishmen, never work for an Irishman, never have my washing done by an Irishwoman, or my shirts made of Irish linen, and that when I said the prayer in the book for all the world, I should make a special reservation of the Irish, and' insert a petition that in the general resur- rection they be oveirooked " by particular desire." At this juncture Bull Dogge fainted away, and was brought to by the High Lord Noodle throwing dirty water in his face, and treading on his corns. , I was then made to stand upon my feet, hold up my right hand, and take a terrible swear to the effect that I would never reveal the grand principle of the order; which is to get trusted at the Irish groceries, and use their liquor as long as credit holds ng- as cred't, holds   I I:S T E-UR0T D-.     245V D out, in order to: drink, u all the:Irish:wiskey,: and' get it out of the country ;the suppoition being, that when the liquor is gone and the potato rot has done its worst, the Irish will all perish for want of nourish- ment. Should any survive this annihilation of their national and necessary food, it is proposed to organ- ize a company of volunteer, Native Know Nothing Thugs, who are to circulate through the country and make an end of the rest, and at the same time sack all the nunneries, burn-all the Popish churches, and finish up all the Foreign Catholics. I was promised by the Ineffable Noodle, that if I did my; duty well Hshould have the pleasure of choking a doze tr two priests, burning a couple of churches, and running away with the prettiest nun I could pick out.    -  Instructions were then given me how to/work my way into a lodge of unadulterated Kndw No- things.

Each - member is bound to bring a bottle of Irish whiskey to every meeting, and drink it all before he goes, in order to prove his devotion to the cause, and his determination to expunge the foreign ele- ment from the liquid comforts of the country. The recognition of members in the street is as follows:-One rolls his chew of tobacco into the upper- story of his left cheek, at the same time motioning with his thumb over his shoulder towards the nearest grocery; if the other nods his head and starts towards the rum-shop on a run, the- question of fraternity is decided, and they know each other as members of the K. N. brotherhood. Since my initiation I have striven to live up to the principles of the order, and have got trusted for so much Irish liquor that I have kept all my friends dead drunk for a month, and have three times had to bail Bull Dogge out of the station-house, whither he had been taken for being inebriated in the street, and giving the K. N. signs to the M. P., and trying to pull his star off, insisting that an Irishman has no right to wear the badge of the order. The intention is to elect the next President, when   H OAXED.        247 there is to be an immediate end made of all foreign- ers; they will drown the Dutchmen in Lager Bier, pelt the Irish to death with potatoes, and pen up all the Frenchmen in second-hand flat-boats, and send them over Niagara Falls. I was expelled from the order for eating Dutch "Sauerkrout" with an oyster stew, and I am now in danger of losing my life, as I hear that the Ineffable Noodle is on the look-out for me, having two revolvers -and a- bowie-knife in his bosom; a Con- greve rocket in his hat; a six inch bomb in each pocket; a large jack-knife in his pantaloons; and a Mexican lasso round his waist. ,P. S. I have just discovered that I have been hoaxed-that the lodge into which I was admitted is not the genuine article, but a spurious society who take in members under false pretences, by making thetm believe that this is the society of "Sam." The truth is, however, that "Sam" lives in dif- ferent quarters, and has a different set of people about him; and if I can gain admission to a lodge of the pure-bred K.

When I desire to speak of the various beauties of this feathered pledge of friendship, language can't come to time. His legs rival the Grand-street liberty-pole, in length, size, and symmetry-in fact, he exhibits rather a strong tendency to run to legs; his plumage is variegated and generally shaggy, and his disposition courageous; he has an eve like a hen hawk, a tail like the butt-end of a feather-duster, and a voice like a rhinoceros with the whooping cough;   8SHANGHAE.        -249 he is perfect in every point; to combine in a single expression, the elegance and euphony of the ancient Latin tongue, and the expressive intensity of the more modern Bowery idiom, he is literally "gallus." He is a present from Burnham, Professor No. 1  of Henology, and such -a 'proficient in universal humbug that he ranks only second to; the Bridgeport Fejee Prince-Burnham, who made one fortune by selling " pure bred"Shanghae stock, and another by showing up the tricks of the trade, and the mysteries of Roosterdom, in a blue covered book, with gilt edges, and who has now left the hen trade, only keeping on hand a few chicks, of warranted pure blood, which he ^prescribes at high, prices to any anxious individuals who haven't yet had the "hen fever "-(a popular epidemic, price $1, can be caught at any book store).

Like the eastern prince, who, when he wants to ruin a man, makes him a present of an elephant, which court etiquette will allow him neither to give away, sell, or kill, and which he must keep and allow to devour his patrimony; so the vengeful Burnham, for some unmentioned injury which I have done him, has sent me this rapacious villain, who eats as if he was the result of a cross between the Anaconda and the Ostrich.

The "medium" aforesaid, was a vinegar-complex- ioned woman, with a very ruby nose, mouth the exact shape of the sound-hole to a violin, who wore green spectacles, and robes of equivocal purity. The furniture consisted of several chairs, a mirror, no carpet, a small stand, a large dining table, and in one corner of the room a bedstead, washstand, and bookcase, with writing desk on top. After some remarks by the medium, we formed the magic circle, by sitting close together, and putting our hands on the table. Bull Dogge, who, despite the Maine law, had a bottle in his pocket, took a big drink before he laid his ponderous fists by the side of the others.

Listen, wonder, and believe! Some time since, I had a beloved and beautiful bull-terrier--(not the Bull-Dogge alluded to in other epistles,) he was perfect in every point-his hair stuck out in multitudinous directions-his snarl was of the crossest-his teeth of the sharpest, and his ordinary behavior exhibited a general and impartial hatred of mankind. He was a canine Tshmael, for every man's hand was against him'. His cognomen savored of the satanic. I called him Pluto. He mysteriously disappeared--ah offered reward of seven dollars and a half failed to restore him to my fireside. I tearfully gave him up, and mourned sincerely.

Having recovered somewhat from my momentary astonishment, I sung out to fire away. No sooner said than done--the services of the feline " medium " were instantly dispensed with, and there suddenly appeared to my bewildered sight the unmistakable form of my lamented Pluto. I was astonished, and so I said, but I could not be deluded--it was my " real, old, original, genuine" Pluto. I knew his warning growl-I recognized the friendly wag of his tail--I could have sworn to each particular hair. He addressed me in a voice trembling with emo- tion-he narrated the full history of his untimely decease-told of his seduction by a tempting mutton Cop, and consequent abduction by the remorseless thief-his vain and ineffectual struggles to escape- related his incarceration in an unseaworthy canal- boat, with a hundred other unfortunates-described their embarkation and departure for a foreign mar- ket-the terrific collision which ensued when about four miles and a half from port, when the canal-boat s was met by a mudscow which was recklessly running with great velocity in a thick fog, the tire force   HEARS ,HS WRONGS.       265 of her propelling apparatus (one-horse power) being brought into requisition to attain a frightful speed-- he dwelt upon the terrors of the scene-the dastardly desertion of the crew, (a mulatto woman and'two coffee-colored boys,) who took to the boat, (a bass- wood "dugout,") and escaped, leaving the helpless passengers to their awful fate.

The whole history was related with an appearance of earnestness and sincerity which left not a doubt of its truth; and the entire narrative was couched in such elegant language that I strongly suspected that Pluto had read the report-of those accommo- dating spirits who had imparted such reliable infor- mation concerning the untimely loss of the lamented steamship "Arctic," toga distinguished,. and formerlyr b     * S,  &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC8054-00000139"/> 266       DOESTIOKS. supposed-sensible-and-sane, Judge of the Superior Court fo the Empire State.- And, like those unfor. tunate ghosts, these, too, came to reveal to mortal ears the story of their sufferings and death. For my beloved animal was not alone: with him appeared the disembodied ghosts of' aI the crowd who perished with him. Pluto informed me that they were in such a dis- turbed state of mind that 'they did not know much yet-most of them were not permanently billeted-- bult that he himself, on account of his superior sagacity, had been already assigned his sphere and situation.

And, even as one of our most learned, wise and illustrious rulers, and his brother Rapperites, have demonstrated that the spirits of the departed are busied in employments similar to their earthly ones, so did my reliable Pluto state similar facts concerning the honorable company of beasts, birds, and reptiles. His discourse ran much as follows: "Know, men of earth, that shadowy  horses still throng your streets, harnessed to intangible drays, and to incorporeal express wagons, and still tailfully drag innumerable three-cent stages; they still live in your stables, graze in your pastures, and drink at your pumps; drivers, malignant, though unseen, still lash their unreal sides with cutting whips, until they j   SPEAKS OF HS DISCOURSE.        269 become overcome with ire, and viciously kick over their spectral traces; defunct racers still haunt the scenes of their former triumphs, skim  with feet unshod round the inside track, and scornfully turn up their goblin noses at the fastest earthly time on record; transparent donkeys wag complacently their celestial ears, and brush off airy flies with unsub- stantial tails.

When my darling Pluto had spoken thus, the company began to disappear. A mist seemed gra- dually to envelope all, and one by one they faded from my mortal vision, and soon all save Pluto had vanished from my sight.

EVERYBODY    knows that Election day any- where creates an unusual excitement; but it is in the large cities where partisan feeling runs the highest, where strongest and strangest influences are brought into requisition to influence the election of favorite candidates; where the people are made to act as blind confederates in a skilful scheme of party trickery and political legerdemain, which places one man into office, and defeats the expectations of another, whom they fully expected to see invested with the imaginary robes of municipal power. So dexterously are' the ^cups and balls shifted by the party leaders, and so cunningly is the pack shuffled, that the rank and file of the different cliques can't tell where -the " little joker " is, or who holds the trump card, for an hour together.

Having an innate love of courage and noble deeds, (my father was Captain in the artillery,)I could not but look with admiration upon the chivalrous manner in which four or five of them will undauntedly lay hold upon a single man, if very drunk--and the courageous valor they display in fearlessly knocking 'off his hat, intrepidly twisting their fingers in his neck-cloth, unshrinkingly stepping on his toes and kicking his shins, and stout-heartedly rapping his knuckles with their hard wood clubs. Emulous to rival such doughty heroism, I made application for the situation of policeman, "Z., 785," which position had been vacated by the chief, in consequence of the late incumbent having got drunk at the corner grocery, and pawned his uniform and star to get money to bet on a rat-terrier.

They asked us what we had done to secure the election of the regular ticket. Welshman said he had voted twice, built bonfires, carried flags, torn down the handbills--of the opposite party, and that just before the time for voting was up, perceiving a crowd of our opponents about the polls, he had raised an alarm of fire and got an engine company to come tearing through the crowd and scatter them so that they couldn't get their votes in before the doors closed. Now came my turn-told them I had got up six free fights, challenged fourteen whig voters, knocked the hats over the eyes of eight of them and changed their tickets in the confusion, thereby making them vote for Hoggs, when their bread and butter depended upon the election of Noggs. 12  e  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC8054-00000149"/> 286       DOESTICKS.

Told them I had finished the day by getting up a row in the office, breaking the inspector's spectacles with a' brick, and slipping into the ballot-box sixty- three votes for Hoggs before he got the glass out of his eyes.

He went off, and I returned to the field of battle and took into custody a man with his head cut open, who was lying-across the curb-stone; led him to the Station House, and complained of him for breaking the peace.

He is buried, but he is not dead; he is entombed, but lie is still alive. After a metropolitan existence of a few months had partially relieved him of his rural verdure; after having seen with appreciating eyes the suburbs of a town which alone contains the entire and undivided elephat, he has voluntarily exiled himself to a stagnant village in the Western wilderness-a sleepily-ambitious little townlet, vainly, for many years, aspiring to the dignity of cityhood, but which still remains a very baby of a city, not yet (metaphorically speaking) divested of those rudi- mentary triangular garments peculiar to weaklings in an undeveloped state-without energy enough to cry when it is hurt, or go-aheadism sufficient to keep its nose clean.

Anatomically speaking, friend Damphool, I sup- pose thou hadst a heart; emotionally, not a trace of one; the feeble article which served thee in that capacity knew no more of generous thoughts and noble impulses than a Shanghae pullet knows of the opera of Norma. Go, immerse thyself in that Western town where, like the rest who dwell therein, thy abilities will be undeveloped, thy talents will be, veiled, thy energies rust out, and thou wilt become, like them, a peram- bulating, passive, perpetual sacrifice to the lazy gods of Sloth and Sanctity. I shall mourn thy taper legs; I shall lament thy excruciating neck-tie; I shall weep that last coat that did so very long a tail unfold ; I shall sorrow for thy unctuous hairs, and grieve for thy perfumed whiskers. I shall look in vain for thy polished boots and jew- eled hands; I shall miss thy intellectual countenance, radiant with innocent imbecility; and I shall lose my daily meditation upon the precarious frailty of those intangible legs.

But these are things it will not do to speak of; only the gross appetites of the three cent drinker should be made matters of common conversation. Travelling lately through the thirsty State of Ohio, I had many opportunities of observing how they get round and over the letter of the Law. In that state the framers of the law, with a com- mendable regard for the commercial welfare of their constituents, many of whom are large vine-growers, inserted a special clause allowing the traffic in beer and native wine to remain unmolested. Travellers will therefore find in this State now a greater variety of wine than is grown in any other one country in the world. Liquors which he, in another place, would recog- nise as brandy, rum, or gin, are partially disguised under transparent cognomiens as native wine. Brandy-" smashes," rum-punches, gin-cock-tails, sherry-cobblers, mint-juleps, and every kind of desir- able potable, are all manufactured from "Longworth's Sparkling "--old corn-whiskey is known as "Still   INSPECTS THE    ELLAER.    309 Catawha "-and a vast deal of the " lager-beer " is put up: in brandy casks, and tastes exceedingly like the genuine article. Being in the vicinity of the Pork city (where they have a ham on the top of the tallest church spire in the place, pointing with the knuckle end to Heaven,) I had an opportunity to visit: a large wine-cellar which belonged to Damphool's uncle, who was to accompany us, and had also from him permission to taste the different vintages. Got to the place, went down cellar, boy gave each of us a long stick with a tallow candle on the end; got down; wine everywhere, in big casks, in long bottles, in small bottles, in tin dippers, in glass vials, and in little puddles on the floor. Bottles ranged in regiments all wrong side up with cobwebs on the corks. Every one had the year of the vintage painted on the bottom, as if it was a British baby and its age had to be registered by the parish.

He would insist on getting on top of the reservoir --had a glass pump in his hand-pumped up wine for every body-put the spout into his mouth, and pumped into himself for an hour,--first fifteen minutes made him rich; second quarter of an hour made him tearful; at the end of forty-five minutes he was helpless but happy; and when the hour was up he tumbled -off the top of the machine and we stowed him away in a corner, where he lay until he revived sufficiently to' be able to partake of some bread and butter which the Dutch housekeeper gave us, and which he insisted was lobster salad, and kept calling for boiled eggs, olive oil, and mustard to dress it with. At last he was taken violently sick, and we took him out doors, set him on top of a basswood stump, when he looked like "'Patience on a monument smiling "-although he tried to convince us that he was D.

The female visitors who attend the delectable per- formances of the talented corps of this colored esta- blishment, do not make themselves quite so ridicu- lous with their dress as their white competitors, but it is only because they have not -the money to be as fashionable; the desire is probably fully as strong, but the cash don't hold out, s    DESCRIPTIONS.        315 And, as the white folks, in the construction of their pieces for dramatic representation, sometimes repre- sent in a peculiar light the warmer blooded pas- sions of their " dark complected" neighbors, in retaliation the colored dramatists reverse the order and make the white men in their drama wait upon the colored heroes, black their boots, groom their imaginary horses, brush their coats, and perform all the varied round of servile duties which in represen- tatives of the same plays by white men are assigned to them. The play of Othello is the single exception-they make the Venetian warrior a white man in a red roundabout, who makes fierce love to Desdemona,i who is the molasses-colored child of a respectable darkey whitewasher. Lorgnettes, Opera-hoods, and white kids are not exhibited here in such profusion as in some other places of amnusefnent; on the contrary, green spec- tacles, sun-bonnets, and calico dresses are rather in the ascendant.

Macheth was a fat gentleman of jetty hue who might have been head-cook at Delmonico's for twenty years, and who would, had he been subjected to a melting process, have furnished soap and candles enough for a small chandlery business. Whether he intended to give the tragedy a gastro- nomical interpretation or not is uncertain, but it is a veritable fact that he dressed the character in a cook's apron, had a paper cap with a long turkey feather in it on his head, his steel by his side, a butcher-knife in his hand, and the cover of the soup- pot for a shield. Macduff was attired more like a Lake Superior Indian than anything else, with a superfluity of red flannel fringe, and silver rings in his ears and nose. Lady Macheth rejoiced in a tin crown with seven points, each one with a crescent on top, brass-heeled gaiters, a dress with as purple waist, and a green baize train, two cameo bracelets, and lemon-colored kid gloves.            -J  &#xD;<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC8054-00000165"/> 318       DOESTICKS. Old King Duncan was a young man who seemed to labor under the impression that to support his royal dignity it was only necessary to grin inces- santly, and turn his toes in when he walked; his royal highness had on a high hat with a red feather, plaid pantaloons (being the only symptom of Scotch costume visible during the evening), and an embroi- dered vest, through which, as he wore no coat, the sleeves of his blue shirt appeared in agreeable con- trast; he sported a silver watch, four seal rings, an opera glass, and a gold-headed cane. All the other characters were dressed with equal regard to propriety and elegance of costume, and with equal disregard to expense. The warlike paraphernalia were on the same ap- propriate scale; instead of Scottish claymores and basket-hilted swords, muskets were introduced which had probably seen service in some target company, until too battered and damaged for. further use; shields were dispensed with except in the single case of Macduff,-instead of daggers, many were pro- vided with horse-pistols, and one aspiring individual had a sword-cane and a sluhg-shot. Several of the " supes" were painted like Indians, and carried banners made of horse-blankets, nailed   DESORIBES THE CHARACTERS. 319, to barrel staves--the three witches had each a hoe and a stable-fork, and Hecate was equipped with a straw-hatand a pair of linen drawers put on hind- side foremost. The play commenced, and every thing proceeded in the greatest harmony until the caldron scene, when the apparitions, instead of rising through the trap into the caldron, deliberately crawled from the ring on their hands and knees, and stuck their heads through a hole in a board which was painted in ad- mirable imitation of a dinnerpot, and delivered their prophetic speeches in a huge whisper to the anxious Thane. The apparition of a " child's head crowned," as the stage direction reads, was done by a fat piccaninny, who was drawn on screaming and kicking in a wil- low basket by a hidden rope, and the speech was read by the prompter, who squatted- down behind the basket, and held his hand over the baby's month in a vain effort to stop his noise.  During this scene Macheth, who was too obese to stand for so long a time comfortably, seated himself composedly on athree-legged stool which did duty afterwards as a throne,-and in fact, whenever during the performance he found himself incommoded by  &#xD;<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC8054-00000166"/> 320       DOESTICK1S. the warmth, he would sit flat down on the most con- venient resting-place. His rendering of the dagger scene was peculiarly original-he took his butcher-knife, tied it by a tow string to a pitch-fork which he stuck in the middle of the stage, sat flat down on the floor before it, and proceeded to-deliver the speech with great force and emotion; pausing occasionally to top his forehead with a yellow bandana handkerchief, and refresh himself by long sips from a pewter mug of beer which he had bestowed in his original shield. The rest of the company got along very well, ma- naging the removal of Birnam wood in rather a unique manner-when the soldier spoke of a " mov- ing wood" a back scene opened and discovered four darkies carrying pine kindling wood from a wagon with a jackass team, down cellar into a coal-hole. Whenever an actor forgot his part the prompter would rush out from his hiding place, put the offend- ing artist in the proper position, read his lines for him, and suddenly disappear, until some fresh delin- quency called for another shirt-sleeve advent. Matters progressed towards the close of the piece -Lady Macheth had played the lighted -candle scene (using a bed-lamp, a candle not being forth-   VIEWS THE DEATH SCENE.      321 coming)-had made her last exit, leaving the green baize train, which had come untied, in the middle of the stage, a sad memorial of her fate-the soldiers had met in a pitched battle (every "Supe" had in- sisted on dying a death of his own, in order to dis. play his tragic genius), and had expired in various uncomfortable positions; one sitting up against the flat, with his leg through a trap-door, and his mouth open, and another with his head through a bushel basket which he had brought on to use as a shield- all the minor business of the piece was got along with, and it only remained for Macduff and the rotund Macheth to have their fight, say their say, die their die, and finish the play. They entered arm in arm, being evidently deter- mined, like prize-fighters, to do their " bloody busi- ness" amicably, and as old friends ought. Macduff remarked to the audience that they were going to "settle that little quarrel"-they then pro- ceeded to strip for the contest. Macduff retired to one corner and pulled off his boots and spectacles, Macheth went to another and laid down his jacket and shield-then they met in the middle, shook hands-one flourished a long toasting  &#xD;<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC8054-00000167"/> 322  .

All their munitions of war being exhausted, they close in an expiring wrestle, and Macheth eventu- ally dies, having first in the terrific struggle suffered amputation of the pantaloons immediately above both knees. Macduff recovers his rolling-pin, and stands over the conquered Macheth in a grand saw-buck attitude of victory and triumph.   XXXVI. nzg   Onom^ a  tn it g r eses j - reat fdit- nret n1" abhbn.  HE late grand convention of precocious and pinguid children, created such a stir through- out the country, that the news, by some unknown conveyance, penetrated even to the obscure Wolve- rine hamlet wherein-Damphool had for four months been content to vegetate. The infantile humbug promised something new in the way of sight-seeing, and as he desired to meet all his relatives and name- sakes who would be certain to be present on that eventful occasion, 'and wished to improve this noble opportunity of contemplating the infant Damphools of the country, who were to be thiere exhibited by their stultified progenitors, he took the next train of cars and started for Gotham, to view this first con- gress of rudimentary "humans."

I had some old fashioned notions that babies should be kept at home, and allowed to take their necessary allowance of nutriment, and soil their nz-necessary allowance of linen (a baby is always wrapped up in cloth enough to full-rig a topsail schooner, from the middle of which its insignificant head sticks out, like a lap-dog which has been rolled up by mistake in the parlor carpet), within the limits of the domestic circle ; and not paraded before the public to performn these pleasing functions in the presence of an assemblage, composed in great part, of modest young men and bashful maidens, unini- tiated as yet, in the mysteries of baby life. After laboring for some time to convince me that *  , A   VISITS THE BABY SHOW.      325 adolescent and embryo human stock is as legitimate a subject of exhibition as any other animal ,and that fecund mothers and high-blooded fathers should be as much brought into public notice as brood mares, or imported Durham cattle; and that public displays of fine children, and a discussion of the mode of rearing and training them, and an interchange of sentiments on these important points between those of most experience in the matter, would tend to the great physical improvement of the human race, I was so far satisfied that I agreed to go and witness the latest effort of the "Great American Showman" to get up a sensation. Went to the entrance of the place of exhibition, took a look at the show-bills below, and the huge painting above, which represented in the most pro- minent rainbow hues the supposed appearance of the infant wonders-at the waxen boy in a scratch wig and full suit of Young America clothes, and the impassible girl of like material, whose Cereous head was covered with such a crop of hempen curls that if woven into a rope it would have been long enough to hang half the rogues in the city; which two. infant prodigies were the contribution of some enter- prising hair-dresser and wig-maker, and were most  &#xD;<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC8054-00000169"/> 326       DOE3 STI CS. industriously revolving beneath two glass cases in the hall in front of the paying place, and Arhose striking beauty was presumed to be all-powerful to arrest the attention of the hurrying multitude and make them lay down their quarters and take a peep at the exhibition whether they would or no; having, I say, taken a bird's eye glance at all these, we laid down our money (Damphool paid for both) and entered. Tremendous crowd-huarried in-got my toes annihilated, my hat smashed in, and my shirt- collar reduced to the dimensions and appearance of a slimy dishcloth, in less than a minute. Forced our way up to the platform. Saw a num- ber of complacent mothers with movable fronts to their dresses, sitting side by side on an elevated plank, holding their babies in their laps (each one having a stock of baby linen handy, and a huge bucket of some liquid to me unknown, but which looked like starch, within reach, and which every now and then they poured into the faces of the specim en babies who lay with their wide mouths open - like so many young robins) casting jealous glances at each other, tender glances on their young charges, and appealing glances at the crowd before them.   DESCRIBES THE BABIES.       327 The youngest babies were dressed in unaccustomed clean clothes, in which, as they were unused to such style of garments, they looked ten times dirtier than ever-they had a profusion of green and blue ribbons on their frocks, which they kept in their mouths all the time-their faces were full of wrinkles, their eyes were watery and weak, and their pug-noses seemed to be living fountains. Other babies under the required -age (4 years), decked out in all sorts of colors, and with dresses made universally in most execrably bad taste, were standing on some of the other platforms, or running about amongst the crowd, daubing themselves and those  indiscreet and enthusiastic persons who attempted to handle them, with half-dissolved candy, and sticky gingerbread. And occasionally getting up a fight among themselves-where little fists would unceremoniously visit little eyes, and little feet would indulge .in a series of energetic little kicks, and little fingers would pull out little bunches of little curls, and little voices would'give a course of most discordant screams (which were little, but --), and so- the little Tom IIyers would amuse them- selves until separated by some courageous indivi- dual who dared to touch the little monsters.

I stepped up to a lady to ask the age of a baby which she had in her maternal arms, when I found myself instantly a centre of baby attraction-babies seemed to pitch into me from all directions-a baby poked its fingers into my eye, a baby put sugar on my ruffled shirt, a baby. daubed gruel on my white vest, a baby filled my kid glove with milk, a baby dropped something done up in a rag down my neck, and a baby of huge dimensions and unre- deemed ugliness amused itself by filling my hat full of playthings which it appropriated from the weaker babies on either side. So that I found in that article of apparel a tin whistle, three dolls, a sugar house, a miniature Noah's Ark with all the animals, a rattle-box, a hair-brush, and two india-rubber balls. Tried to get out of the muss, but a baby was pull- ing my coat-tails, and a four-year old baby stood upon each foot improving thepattern of my white pants by wiping their dirty hands thereon. I stepped back and knocked over a baby, I rushed forward I and stepped on a baby, I leaped to one side and crushed a small baby in a pink dress, I sprung to the other and crushed a fat baby and its nurse against the wall. I tried to escape from the room   SPEAKS OF THE PRIZES.      329 but tumbled over a baby,--recovered my feet and started again, but babies got between my legs and tripped me down-stairs, where I landed in an exhausted condition, which was by no means im- proved by a careless woman dropping her baby directly on my head from the fourth-story. Saw the distribution of prizes,-first prize given to an Irish baby with a stub nose; second, to a Dutch ditto, with eyes of different colors; and all the rest to the very babies who ought not to have had any, but deserved to be spanked and sent to bed until they should grow decent looking. Not a good-looking baby got a prize, and the very  s who should have taken the premiums were sent home without having their expenses paid. The $100 prize baby did not amount to much after all. Not a young couple who saw it but thought they could do better in less than a year; and the mothers of those babies who didn't get any- thing thought they could beat it on six months' notice. Those industrious ladies who desired to rear a large family in the shortest tine possible, and so had pro- duced three or four children at a birth, were all rewarded by the Great Showman for their extra  &#xD;<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC8054-00000171"/> 330       DO EOSTICKS. pains and labors, and all went home triumphant with a prermiumm for fecundity, and money enough to buy flannel for all the brood. Everybody said the baby show was a humbug-- but everybody went to see it. Everybody said it was disgusting, but everybody paid his twenty-five cents to be disgusted, and everybodyv was disgusted to his heart's content. No one was perfectly satisfied except the mothers of the lucky babies, and the proprietor of the entire concern, who made a small fortune by the operation. The excitement is now over, the public have seen the sight, the press has had its say, the women have shown their babies, Damphool has gone back to the country, and the world, is once more comparatively quiet. -No other so great excitement will agitate the world until next year, when the Great Showman intends to revive the subject, and show the world the modus operandi of baby birth, with illustrations by the mothers of the babies who took the prizes this year, and who in another twelve-month will probably have no shame at all in the matter, and -will stick at nothing. Let us wait, and hope.     &#xD;</p>
