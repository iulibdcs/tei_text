CHAPTER I. I CAN see it now: the little brown house, with its sloping roof, its clumsy old chimneys, and its vine-clad porch; where the brown bee hummed his drowsy song, and my silver-haired old father sat dozing the sultry summer noons away, with shaggy Bruno at his feet. The bright earth had no blight. or mildew then for me. The song of the little birds, resting beneath the eaves, filled my heart with a quiet joy. It was sweet, when toil was over, to sit in the low door-way, and watch the golden sun go down, and see the many-tinted clouds  fade softly away. dike a, dying saint) into the light of hearen, and evening's glittering star glow, like a seraph's eye, above them. 'Twas sweet, when Autumn touched the hill-side foli- age with rainbow dyes, to see the gorgeous leaves come circling down on the' soft Indian-summer breeze. 'Twas sweet, whero the tripping, silver stream lay still and cold in Winter's icy clasp; and the flowers fainted beneath his chilly breath, and the leafless trees stretched out their imploring arms, and shook of impatiently, their snowy burthen, and the heavy wagon-  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7388-00000010"/> "    SHADOWS AND    SUNBEAMS. wheels went creaking past, and the ruddy farmer struck his brawny arms across his ample chest, for warmth, and goaded the lazy, round-eyed oxen up the icy hill. Even then, it was sunshine still, in the little brown house: in the ample chimney glowed and crackled the blazing faggots; rows of shining pans glittered upon the shelves; the fragrant loaf steamed in the lit-  tie oven; the friendly tea-kettle, smoking, sang in the chimney corner, and by its side still sat the dear old father, with the faithful newspaper, that weekly brought us news from the busy world, from which our giant forest-trees had shut us out. Ah!' those were happy days: few wants and no cares: the patfiarch's head was white with grave blossoms, yet his heart was fresh and green. Alas! that, under the lowliest door- - way, as through the loftiest portal, the Guest unbidden cometh. The morning sun rose fair, but it shone upon silver locks that stirred with no breath of life, upon loving lips forever mute, upon a palsied, kindly hand that gave no returning pressure. Soon; over the heart so warm and true, the snow lay white and cold; the winter wind sang its mournful requiem, and from out the little brown house, the orphan passed with tearful gaze and lingering footstep. Jr CHAPTER II. OH, the bitter, bitter bread of dependence! No welcome by the hearth-stone: no welcome at the board: the mocking tone,   SHADOWS AND SUNBEAMS.          15 the cutting taunt, the grudged morsel. Weary days, and sleep less, memory-torturing nights. "Well, Josiah's dead and gone," said my uncle, taking down his spectacles from the mantel, to survey me, as I sank on the settle, in the chimney corner. "Take off your bonnet, Hetty. I suppose we must give you house-room. Josiah never had the knack of saving anything-- more's the pity for you. That farm of his was awfully mismanaged. I could have had twice the produce he did off that land. Sheer nonsense, that shallow ploughing of his, tiring the land all out; he should have used the sub-soil plough. Then he had no idea of the proper rotation of crops, or how to house his cattle in winter, or to keep his tools where they wouldn't rust and rot. That new barn, too, was a useless extravagance. He might have roofed the old one. It's astonishing what a difference there is in broth- ers, about getting beforehand in the world. Now I've a cool thousand in the bank, all for taking care of little things. (There, Jonathan! Jonathan! you've taken the meal out of the wrong barrel: it was the damaged meal I told you to carry to Widow Folger.) "Well, as I was saying, Hetty, in the first place, your father didn't know how to manage; then he didnft know how to say No. He'd lend money to anybody who wanted it, and pay his workmen just what they took it into their heads it was right to ask. Now, there's Jonathan, yonder; a day or two since, he struck for higher wages. Well, I let him strike, and got an Irishman in his place. This morning he came whining back, saying that his wife was sick, and his youngest child lay dead  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7388-00000011"/> 16     SHADOWS AND SUNBEAMS. in the house, and that he was willing to work on at the old wages. That's the way to do, Hetty. If Jonathan chose to saddle himself with a wife and babies, before he was able to feed them, I don't see the justice of my paying for it. But it's time for family prayers: that will be something new to you, I suppose. I don't want to judge any body: I hope your father has gone to Heaven, but I'm afraid he didn't let his light shine. Don't whimper, child; as the tree falls so it must lie. You must see that you do your duty: make yourself useful here in my house, and try to pay your way. Young people of your age consume a great deal in the way of food and clothes." Oh, the monotony of those weary days! how memory lin- gered over the sunny past: how thought shrank back affrighted from the gloomy future: how untiringly and thanklessly I strove to cancel the debt for daily bread, and how despairingly I prayed for relief from such bitter thraldom. CHAPTER   III "Make up the bed in the north room, Hetty," said my aunt; "it's our turn to board the schoolmaster this week. You needn't put on the best sheets: these book-learning folks are always wool-gathering. He never'll know the difference. What a hungry set these schoolmasters are, to be sure: it keeps a body all the time cooking. A bushel of doughnuts is a mere   SHADOWS AND SUNBEAMS.          17 circumstance. When the last master was here, our winjter barrel of cider went off like snow in April. I hope Jonathan learned enough at school to pay for it, but I have my doubts: he trips in the multiplication table yet. Your uncle and I think that this boarding schoolmasters is a poor business--a losing bargain. He says I must put less on the table, but it is no use to try that game with George Grey. He's as indepen- dent as Adam in Eden, before the serpent and his wife got in. He'd just as lief call for anything he wanted as not, and some- how or other, when he does, I always feel as if I had no choice about bringing it. That eye of his always makes me think of forlked lightning; aned yet he's kindly spoken, too. - He is as much of a riddle to unravel, as one of Parson Jones' doctrinal sermons. But, go make his bed, Hetty, and mind you stuff a few rags in that broken pane of glass over it. I spoke to your uncle about getting it mended, but he said warm weather would be along in three months, and that's very true, Hetty. Hist! your uncle is calling you. He says he is going out in the barn to thresh, and if Peter Tay comes up the road, and stops in here again, for him to subscribe towards the minister's new cloak, you must say that he has gone to Jifftown, and will not be home for a week at least. Now don't forget, Hetty: peo- ple seem to think one earns money now-a-days on purpose to give away. A new cloak! humph! I wonder if the Apostle Paul's hearers ever gave him a new cloak? I wonder if John the Baptist ever had a donation party? Don't the minister have his salary, two -hundred dollars a year-part'in produce, part in money; paid regularly, when the times ain't too hard I 2b  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7388-00000012"/> 18     SHADOWS AND SUNBEAMS. Go make the school-master's bed now, Hetty. One pillow will do for him. Goodness knows he carries his head high enough when he is awake. I shouldn't wonder if he had been captain or colonel, or something, some muster day." The schoolmaster! Should I be permitted to go to school 2 or should I be kept drudging at home? Would this Mr. Grey think me very ignorant? I began to feel as if his forked-light- ning eyes were already on me. My cheeks grew hot at the idea of making a blunder in his awful presence. What a mis- erable room my aunt had provided for him! If I could but put up some nice white curtains at the window, or get him a cushioned chair, or put in a bureau, or chest of drawers. It looked so comfortless-so different from the welcome my dear old father was wont to give to "the stranger within the gates:" and now memory pictured him, as he sat in the old arm chair, and I knelt again at the low foot-stool at his feet, and his hand strayed caressingly over my temples, and I listened to old con- tinental stories, till the candle burned low in the socket, and only the fire-light flickered dimly on the old portrait of General Washington, and on my father's time-worn face. My aunt's shrill voice soon roused me from my reverie. Dinner time had come, and with it Mr. Grey-a gentlemanly young man, of about two and twenty, with a bright, keen, blue eye, and a frank, decided, off-hand manner, that seemed to me admirably in keeping with his erect, imposing figure and firm step. Even my uncle reefed in a sail or two in his presence, and my aunt involuntarily qualified her usual bluntness of man- ner. I uttered a heartfelt thanksgiving when dinner was over   SHADOWS AND SUNBEAMS.         19 CHAPTER IV. "HETTY," said my uncle, as the door closed upon Mr. Grey, "I suppose you must go to school, or the neighbors will say we don't treat you well. You ought to be very thankful for such a home as this, Hetty; women are poor miserable crea- tures, left without money. I wish it had pleased Providence to have made you a boy. You might then have done Jonathan's work just as well as not, and saved me his wages and board. There's a piece of stone wall waiting to be laid, and the barn wants shingling. Josiah now would be at the extravagance of hiring a mason and a carpenter to do it. "Crying? I wonder what's the matter now? Well, it's beyond me to keep track of anything in the shape of a woman. One moment they are up in the attic of ecstasy; the next, down in the cellar of despondency, as the Almanac says; and it is as true as if it had been written in the Apocrypha. I only said that it is a thousand pities that you were not a boy ; then you could graft my trees for me, and hoe, and dig, and plant, and plough, and all that sort of thing. This puttering round, wash- ing dishes a little, and mopping floors a little, and wringing out a few clothes, don't amount to much toward supporting your- self. Let me see, you have had,1 since you came here " - and my uncle put on his spectacles, and pulled out a well-thumbed pocket memorandumY-"You've had t-w-o p-a-i-r-s of shoes, at t-h-r-e-e s-h-i-1-l-i-n-g-s a pair, and nine yards of calico, for a dress, at s-i-x c-e-n-t-s a yard. That 'mounts up, Hetty, 'mounts up. You see it costs something to keep you. I earned my  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7388-00000013"/> 20     SHADOWS AND SUNBEA MS. money, and if you ever expect to have any, you must earn yours" - and my uncle took out his snuffbox, helped himself to a pinch, and, with the timely aid of a stray sunbeam, achieved a succession of very satisfactory sneezes. The following day, under the overwhelming consciousness of my feminity and consequent good-for-nothingness, I made my debut at Master Grey's school. It was a huge barn of a room, ill lighted, ill warmed, and worse ventilated, crowded with pupils of both sexes, from the little, chubby A B C D-arian, to the gaunt Jonathan of thirty, who had begun to feel the need of a little ciphering and geogra- phy, in making out his accounts, or superscribing a business letter. There were rows of awkward, mop-headed, freckled, red-fisted boys; and rosy-cheeked, buxom lasses, bursting out of their dresses, half-shy, half-saucy, who were much more conversant with " apple bees," and " husking frolics," than with grammar or philosophy. There was the parson's son, and the squire's and the blacksmith's son, besides a few who hadn't the re- motest idea whose sons they were, having originally been in- dentured to their farming masters, by the overseers of the county alms-house. Amid these discordant elements, Master Grey moved as se. renely as the August moon of a cloudless night; now patting some little curly head, cruelly perplexed by " crooked S ;" now demonstrating to some slow, older brain, a stumbling block in Euclid; now closing the creaking door after an ill-mannered urchin; now overlooking the pot-hooks and trammels of an un- sophisticated scribe, who clutched the pen as if it were a hoe-   SHADOWS AND SUNBEAMS.          21 handle; now feeding the great, draftless Behemoth of a stove with green hickory knots, and vainly attempting to thaw out his own congealed fingers. In a remote corner of the school-room sat Zeb Smith, the village blacksmith's son, who came into the world with his fists doubled up, and had been pugilist-ing ever since. It was Zeb's proud boast that " he had whippped every schoolmaster who had ever appeared in Frog-town," and in his peaceful retreat from under his bent brows, he was now mentally taking the measure of Master Grey, ending his little reverie with a loud, protracted whistle. - Master Grey turned quickly round, and facing Nis overgrown pupil of thirty, said in a voice clear as the click of a pistol, "You will be pleased not to repeat that annoyance, Mr. Smith." Zeb bent his gooseberry eyes full upon the master, and gave him a blast of "Yankee Doodle." All eyes were bent on Master Grey. The guantlet of defi- ance was thrown in his very teeth. Zeb had a frame like an ox, and a fist like a sledge-hammer, and he knew it. Master Grey was slight, but panther-y; to their unscientific eyes, he was already victimized. Not a bit of it! See! Master Grey's delicate white fingers are on Zeb's check shirt-collar; there is a momentary struggle: lips grow white; teeth are set; limbs twist, and writhe, and mingle, and now Zeb lies on the floor with Master Grey's hand- some foot on his brawny chest. ^ Ah, Master Grey! science is sometimes a match for bone and muscle.

Peace restored, Master Grey shakes back from his broad forehead his curly locks, and summons the first class in geog- raphy. A row of country girls, round as little barrels and red as peonies, stand before him, their respect and admiration for "the master " having been increased ten per cent. by his vic- tory over Zeb. Feminity pardons any thing in a man sooner than lack of courage. The recitation goes off very well, with the exception of Miss Betsey Jones, who persists in not reciting at all. Master Grey looks at. her: he has conquered a man, but that's no reason why he should suppose he can conquer a woman. He sees that written in very legible characters in Miss Bessie4 saucy black eye. Miss Bessy is sent to her seat, and warned to stay after school, till her lesson is learned and recited perfectly. With admirable nonchalance, she takes her own time to obey, and commences drawing little caricatures of the master, which she places in her shoe, and passes round un- der the desk, to her more demure petticoat neighbors. School is dismissed: the last little straggler is kicking up his heels in the snow drifts, and Master Grey and Miss Bessie are left alone. Master Grey inquires if the lesson is learned, and is told again by Miss Bessie, with a toss of her ringlets, that she has no intention of learning it. Master Grey again re. minds her that the lesson must be recited before she can go home. Bessie looks mischievously at the setting sun, and plays with the master's commands and her apron strings. An hour passes, and Bessie has not opened the book. Master Grey con- suits his watch, and reminds her " that it is growing dark." Bessie smiles till the dimples play hide and seek on her cheekr   SHADOWS AND 8UNBEAMS.           23 but she says nothing. Another' hour- Master Grey bites his lip, and, replacing his watch in his pocket, says, "I see your intention, Miss Betsey. It is quite impossible, as you knw, for us to remain here after dark. To-morrow morning, if your lesson is not learned, I shall punish you in the presence of the whole school. You can go." "Thank you, sir," says Bessie, with mock humility, as she crushed her straw hat down over,her bright ringlets. "Mischief take these women," Master Grey was heard to utter, as he went through the snow by starlight to a cold sup- per. "Shall I conquer Zeb, to strike my colors to a girl .of sixteen? :' There was plenty to talk about over the brown bread and milk, at the farmers' tea-tables that night; the youngsters all' made up their minds that if there was " a time to play," it was not in Master Grey's school-room, and the old farmers said they were glad the District had a schoolmaster at last that was good for something, and that they should think better of city chaps in future for his sake. Even Zeb himself acknowledged, over his father's forge, as he mended his broken suspenders, that Master Grey was a " trump." The nine o'clock bell summoned again the Frog-town pupils to the District School. Master Grey in vain looked in Bessie's face for any sign of submission. She had evidently made up her mind to brave him. After the usual preliminary exercises, she was called up to recite. Fixing her saucy black eyes upon him, she said, "I told you I would not learn that lesson, and have not lmened it." 'And I told you," aid Master Grey, (a  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7388-00000015"/> 24     SHADOWS AND SUNBEAMS. slight flush passing over his forehead) that I should punish you if you did not learn it? Did I not?" Bessie's red lip quiv eqed, but she deigned him no reply. "You will hold out your hand, Betsey," said Mr. Grey, ta- king up a large ferule that lay beside him. The color left Bessie's cheek, but the little hand was extended with martyr-like determination, and amid a silence that might be felt, the ferule came down upon it, with justice as unflinching as if it were not owned by a woman. Betsey was not proof against this humil- iation; she burst into tears, and the answering tear in Master Grey's eye showed how difficult and repugnant had been the task. From that day, Master Grey was " monarch of all he sur- veyed," and, truth compels me to own, by none better loved or more implicitly obeyed, than by Miss Bessie. Master Grey's " boarding week " at my uncle's had now ex- pired. What a change had it effected in me! Life was no longer aimless: the old, glad sparkle had come back to my heavy eye; I no longer dreaded the solitude of my own thoughts. The dull rain dropping on my chamber roof had its music for my ears; the stars wore a new and a glittering brightness, and Winter, with his snowy mantle, frosty breath, and icicle diadem, seemed lovelier to me than violet-slippered Spring, with roses in her hair. I still saw Master Grey each day at school. How patiently he bore with my multiplied deficiencies, and with what a delicate and womanly appreciation of my extreme sensitiveness, he soothed my wounded pride.

CHAPTER V. "BETSEY," said my uncle, " we shall want you at home now. It will be impossible for me to get along without you, unless I hire a hand, and times are too hard for that: so you must leave school. You 've a good home here, for which you ought to be thankful, as ryve told you before; but you must work, girl, work!

If you must live on us, (and I can't say that I see the necessity,) I repeat, I wish you had been born a boy." "But as I am not a boy, Uncle, and as I do not wish to be a burthen to you, will you tell me how to support myself?" "Don't ask me. I'm sure I don't know. That is your business. I have my hands full to attend to my own affairs. I am deacon of the church, beside being trustee of the Sand- wich Island Fund. I don't get a copper for the office of deacon; nobody pays me for handing round the contribution box; not a cent of the money that passes through my hands goes into my till; not a mill do I have by way of perquisite, for doling it out to bed-ridden Widow Hall, or asthmatic Mr. Price. Not a penny the richer was I, for that twenty dollars I collected in the contribution box at last communion: no, I am a poor man, comparatively speaking. I may die yet in the almshouse; who knows? You must work, girl, work; can't have any drones in my hive." A shadow just then passed the window. I should know that retreating footstep! Could it be that Master Grey had come to the door with the intention of calling, and overheard my uncle? At least, then, I was spared the humiliation tf ex- posing his parsimony.   SHADOWS AND SUNBEAMS.         27 CHAPTER VI. IT was the night for the weekly vestry lecture. I was left quite alone in the old kitchen. My uncle had extinguished the lamp in leaving, saying that it was " a waste to burn out oil for me." The fire, also, had been carefully taken apart, and the brands laid at an incombustible distance from each other. The old clock kept up a sepulchral, death-watch tick, and I could hear the falling snow drifting gloomily against the windows. I drew the old, wooden settle closer between the tall and- irons, and sat sorrowfully gazing into the dying embers. What was to become of me for it seemed impossible to bear lon- ger the intolerable galling of my yoke. Even the charity of strangers seemed to me preferable to the grudging, insulting tolerance of my kindred. But, with my sixteen years' experi- ence of quiet valley-life, where should I turn my untried foot- steps? To Him who guideth the little bird through the path- less air, would I look. Weeping, I prayed. "My poor child," said a voice at my side; and Master Grey removed my hands gently from my tear-stained face, and held them in his own. "My poor Hetty, life looks very dark to you, does it not? I know all you suffer. Don't pain your- self to tell me about it; I overheard your uncle's crushing words. I know there are none to love you - none to care for you -none on whom you can lean. It is a bitter feeling, my poor child. I, too, have passed through it. You would go  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7388-00000017"/> 28     SHADOWS AND SUNBEAMS. from hence, but where? Life is full of snares, and you are too young, and too inexperienced to brave them. "Hetty," and Master Grey drew me gently toward him,-- ' Hetty, could you be happy with me?" Is the ship-wrecked mariner happy, who opens his despair- ing eyes at length in the long looked for, long prayed for, home? Is the little bird happy, who folds her weary wings safe fTom the pursuer's talons, in her own fleece-lined nest? Is the little child happy, who wakes, sobbing, in the gloomy night, from troubled dreams, to find his golden head still safely pillowed on the dear, maternal bosom . CHAPTER VII. IT was very odd and strange to me, my new home in the great, busy city; with its huge rows of stores and houses, its myriad restless feet, and anxious, care-worn faces; its glittering wealth, its squalid poverty; the slow moving hearse, and the laughing harlequin crowd; its noisy Sabbaths, and its gor- geous churches, with its jeweled worshippers, and its sleepy priests; its little children, worldly-wise and old, and its never- ceasing, busy hum, late into the day's pale light. I had no ac- quaintances: I needed none; for I moved about my pretty little home as in a glad dream. My husband was still "Mas-   SHADOWS AND SUNBEAMS.          29 ter Grey," but over a private school of his own, bounded by no "District,"' subject to the despotic dictation of no "Commit- tee." In his necessary absence, I busied myself in arranging and re arranging his books, papers and wardrobe, thinking the while such glad thoughts! And when the little mantel clock chimed the hour of return, my cheek flushed, my heart beat quick, and my eyes grew moist with happy tears, at the sound of the dear, loved footstep. How very nice it seemed to sit at the head of that cheerful little table- to make, with my own hands, the fragrant cup of tea--to grow merry with my husband, over crest-fallen Zeb, and poor, stubborn little Bessie, and my uncle's time worn bug- bear of a memorandum book! And how proud I was of him, as he sat there correcting some school-boy's Greek exercise, while I leaned over his shoulder, looking attentively at his fine face, and at those unintelligible hieroglyphics, and blushing that he was so much wiser than his little Hetty. This thought sometimes troubled me. I asked myself, will my husband never weary of me? I even grew jealous of his favorite authors, of whom he was so fond. Then I pondered the feasibility bf pursuing a course of reading unknown to him, and astonishing him some day with my profound erudition. In pursuance of my plan, I would sit demurely down to some great, wise book; but I saw only my husband's face looking out at me from every page, and my self-inflicted task was sure to end in some blissful dreamy reverie, with which Cupid had much' more to do than Minerva  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7388-00000018"/> 30     SHADOWS AND SUNBEAMS. CHAPTER VIII. "A proposition, Hetty!" said my husband, throwing aside his coat and hat, and tossing a letter in my lap. "It is from a widow lady, who desires that I should take charge of-her little boy, and give him a home in my family, while she goes to the continent, to secure some property lately left her by a foreign relative. It will be advantageous to us, in a pecuniary way, to have him board with us, unless it should increase your cares too much. But, as you are so fond of children, it may, perhaps, after all, prove a pleasant care to you. She is evi. dently a superior woman. Every line in her letter shows it." My husband immediately answered in the affirmative, and the child arrived a week after. He was a fine, intelligent, gen- tlemanly boy of eight years, with large hazel eyes, and trans. parently beautiful temples: disinclined to the usual sports of childhood, sensitive, shy, and thoughtful beyond his years -a human dew-drop, which we look to see exhale. He brought with him a letter from his mother, which powerfully affected my husband. During its perusal he drew his hand repeatedly across his eyes, and sat a long while after he had finished read- ing it, with his eyes closed, in a deep reverie. By-and-by he said, handing me the letter, " there is genius there, Hetty. I never read anything so touchingly beautiful. Mrs. West must be a very talented and superior woman." I glanced over the letter. It fully justified my husband's en. comiums. It was a most touchingappeal to him to watch with paternal care over her only child; but while she spoke with a   SHADOWS AND SUNBEAMS.          31 mother's tenderness of his endearing qualities, she wished him taught implicitly, that first of all duties for the young, obedience. Then followed allusions to dark days of sorrow, during which the love of that cherished child, was the only star in her sky. I folded the letter and sat very still, after my husband left, in my little rocking-chair, thinking. Such a gifted woman as that my husband should have married. One who could have sympathised with him and shared his intellectual pursuits; who would have been something besides a toy to amuse an idle hour, or to minister to his physical necessities. Perhaps it was of this that my husband was thinking, as he sat there with his eyes closed over the open letter. Perhaps he had wed me only from a generous impulse of pity, and that letter had sud- denly revealed to him the happiness of which he was capable with a kindred spirit. I was very miserable. I wished the letter had never reached us, or that I had declined the care of the child. Other letters, of course, would come, and the boy would keep alive the interest in the intervals. I wept long and bitterly. At length I was aroused by the entrance of little Charley. A bright flush mounted to his forehead, when he saw imy swollen eyes. He hesitated a moment, then gliding up to my side he said, sweetly, '"Are you sick? Shall I bathe your head? I used to bathe mamma's head when it pained her." I stood abashed and rebuked in the child's angel presence, and taking the boy, her boy, in my arms, I kissed him as tenderly as if I had been his mother; while in his own sweet way he told me with childish confidence of his own  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7388-00000019"/> 32     SHADOWS AND SUNBEAMS. dead papa; how much he loved mamma; how many, many beautiful things he used to bring her, saying that they were not half good, or half handsome enough for her; how distressed he used to be if she were ill; how carefully he closed the shut- ters, and tip-toed about the house, with his finger on his lip, telling the servants to close the doors gently; and how he prom- ised him little toys, if he would not disturb mamma's slum- bers; and then, how like diamofids his eyes shone, when she got well; and what beautiful flowers he brought her for her vases; and what a nice, soft-cushioned carriage he brought for her to take the air; and how tenderly he wrapped the shawls about her, and how many charges he gave the coachman, to drive slowly and carefully. And then, how dear papa, at last, grew sick himself; and how mamma watched day and night beside his bed, forgetting to sleep, or eat, or drink; and how nobody dared to tell her that the doctor said he must die; and how papa grew fainter and weaker, and how he said, "Kiss me, Mary, and lay your cheek to mine; I can't see you." And then, how mamma fainted and was carried out, and for many, many long days did n't know even her own little Charley;-- and how dreadful it was when she first waked, and tried to re- member what had happened; and how nobody could com- fort her but Charley; and how he used often to wake up in the night, and find her with a lamp looking at him, be. cause when he was asleep he looked so much like dear, dead papa; and how bitterly she would sob when she was sick, be- cause papa was not there to pity her, and bathe her aching head; and how he (Charley) meant, when he grew up to be a   SHADOWS AND SUNBEAMS.          33 man, to get a nice house for her, and put everything she want. ed in it, and make her just as happy as he could. Well has the Saviour said, "Of such is the kingdom of Heaven." That night I bent over little Charley's bed, blessing the little sleeper for his angel teachings, with a heart as calm and peaceful as the mirrored lake, reflecting only the smile of -Heaven. Time passed on. Life became earnest; for a little heart pul- sated beneath my own, and a strange, sweet, nameless thrill sent to my chastened lips a trembling prayer. Tiny caps and robes, with many a hope and fear interwoven in their delicate threads, lay awaiting the infant's advent. I, myself should know the height, and breadth, and depth of a mother's undy- ing love. What could come between me and this new found treasure? Meantime letters continued to come from Charley's mother to her boy, and my husband. It was impossible for me to blind myself to his growing interest in them. On the days they were expected, (for she wrote at regular intervals,) he would be absent and abstracted, or if any delay occurred, al- most irritable. When they were received, his eye kindled, his step became elastic, and his whole face grew radiant with hap- piness. As the time drew near for the birth of my infant, I grew timid with sad forebodings. I was sitting, one evening at twilight, watching the setting sun, and thinking of the quiet grave it was gilding, where my silver-haired father slept, in the old church- yard, when my husband entered. An expression of pain flitted 3b  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7388-00000020"/> 34     SHADOWS AND SUNBEAMS. over his features, as he looked at me, and taking my hand, he said, gently, almost tenderly, "You are less well than usual, Hetty; you must not sit here, moping, by yourself." I laid my head upon his shoulder with a happiness I had not known for many months. "Listen to me, dear Grey," said I; "I have a confidence to repose in you that will ease my heart. "It was pity, only, that drew your heart to mine; you do not love me. I have known it a long while since. At first, the discovery gave me a pang keener than death; but I have had a long and bitter struggle with myself and have conquered. It is not your fault that you cannot love me. To the many voices of your heart, which cry, 'Give, give,' my response is weak and unsatisfying. Your wife should be gifted. She should sympathise with you in your intellectual pursuits. She should stimulate your pride, as well as your love. Such an one is Charley's mother. Your heart has already wed her, and as God is my witness, I have ceased to blame you. We can- not help our affections. I cannot help loving you, though I know her mysterious power over your heart. I have seen your struggles, your generous self-reproaches, in some sudden out- burst of kindness toward me, after the indulgence of some bright dream, in which I had no share. Dear Grey, she is worthy of your love. She has a heart, noble, good and true; a heart purified by suffering. I see it in every line she writes. Should I not survive the birth of my infant, I could give your happiness into her keeping without a misgiving, though I have never looked upon her face."   SHAD OWS AND SUNBEBAMS.         35 Little Hetty's noble heart has long since ceased to throb with joy or pain. To her husband's breast is folded the babe, for whose little life her own was yielded up.

IT was a comical little old shop, "Aunt Hepsy's," with its Lil- liputian counter, shelves and stove, and its pigmy assortment of old-fashioned ginghams, twilled cambrics, red flannels, facto- ry cotton and homespun calicoes; its miniature window, with its stock of horn-combs and candy, tin horses and peppermint drops, skeins of yarn and Godfrey's Cordial, gaudy picture books, and six-penny handkerchiefs, from whose center Lafay- ette and George Washington smiled approbatively upon the big A's and little A's printed round the border. "Aunt Hepsy; " so every brimless-hatted urchin in the neigh- borhood called her, though it would have puzzled them worse than the multiplication table, had you asked them why they did so. Year in and year out, her ruddy English face glowed behind the little shop window. Sometimes she would be knit- ting a pair of baby's socks, sometimes inventing most aston- ishing looking bags out of rainbow fragments of silk or ribbon. Sometimes netting watch-guards, or raveling the yarn from some old black stocking, to ornament the " place where the wool ought to grow," on the head of some Topsy doll she was ma- king. Sometimes comforting herself with a sly pinch of snuff,   AUNT HEPSY.          37 or, when sunbeams and customers were scarce, nodding drow- sily over the daily papers. Aunt Hepsy had been a beauty, and her pretty face had won her a thriftless husband, of whom champagne and cigars had long since kindly relieved her. And though Time had since forced her to apply to the perruquier, he had gallantly made atonement by leaving her in the undisputed possession of a pair of very brilliant black eyes. Add to this a certain air of coquetry, in the fanciful twist of her gay-colored turban, and the disposal of the folds of her lace kerchief over her ample English bust - and you have a faithful daguerreotype of "Aunt Hepsy." From the window of her little shop she could look out upon the blue waters of the bay, where lay moored the gallant ships, from whose tall masts floated the stars and stripes, and whose jolly captains might often be seen in Aunt Hepsy's shop, exchanging compliments and snuff, and their heavy voices heard, recounting long Neptune yarns, and declaring to the bux- om widow that nothing but the little accident of their being already spliced for life, prevented their immediately spreading sail with her for the port of Matrimony. Aunt Hepsy usually frowned at this, and shook her turbaned head menacingly, but immediately neutralized it, by offering to mend a rip in their gloves, or replace a truant button on their overcoats. It was very odd, how universally popular was Aunt Hepsy. She had any number of places to " take tea," beside a standing invitation from half-a-dozen families, to Christmas and Thanks- giving dinners, and to New-Year's suppers. She had an eligible  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7388-00000022"/> 88         AUNT HEPSY. seat in church, gratis; an inexhaustible bottle of sherry for her often infirmities; fresh pies on family baking days, news- papers for stormy day reading; tickets to menageries, and in- vitations to picnics. She always procured lodgings at a cheaper rate than anybody else; had the pleasantest room in the house at that, the warmest seat at table, the strongest cup of coffee, the brownest slice of toast, the latest arrival of buckwheats, the second joint of the turkey, and the only surviving piece of pie. To be sure, she always praised ugly babies, asked old maids why they would be so cruel as to persist in remaining unmarried, entreated hen-pecked husbands to use their powerful influence over their wives to secure to her their custom; begged the newly fledged clergyman to allow her a private perusal of his last Sunday's able discourse; complimented ambitious Esaus on the luxuriant growth of their very incipient, and microscopically perceptible whiskers; asked dilapidated, rejected widowers, when they in- tended taking their choice of a wife out of a bevy of rosy girls, and declared to Editors that she might as well try to get along without her looking glass, as without their interesting news- papers. One day, the little shop was shut up. Nine o'clock came- eleven o'clock, and the shutters were still closed, and Aunt Hep- sy so punctual, too! What could it mean? Old Mrs. Brown was ready to have fits because she could n't get another skein of yarn to finish her old man's stockings. Little Pat Dolan had roared himself black in the face, because he could n't spend his cent to buy some maple sugar; and the little match   AUNT HEPSY.        ,   39 girl stood shivering at the corner Tor a place to warm her poor benumbed fingers, while the disappointed captains stamped their feet on the snow, stuffed their cheeks with quids, and said it was " deuced funny," and an old maid, opposite, who had long prayed that Aunt Hepsy's reign might be shortened, laid her skinny forefinger on her hooked nose, and rolled up the whites of her eyes like a chicken with the pip. It was no great enigma, (at any rate not after you found it out!) Rich old Mr. Potts ventured into Aunt Hepsy's shop, one day, to buy a watch-ribbon. He was very deaf; so Aunt Hepsy had to come round the counter to wait upon him, and the upshot of it was, that she and Cupid together, hailed him through an ear-trumpet; and all I know about it is, that they have now a legalized right to a mutual pillow and snuff-box,] and that the little shop window still remains unopened, while the old maid hisses between her teeth, as Aunt Hepsy rolls by in her carriage, "How do you suppose she did it ."  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7388-00000023"/> THOUGHTS AT CHURCH. I HAVE an old-fashioned way of entering church, before the bells begin to chime. I enjoy the quiet, brooding stillness. I love to think of the many words of holy cheer that have fallen there, from heaven-missioned lips, and folded themselves like snow-white wings over the weary heart of despair. I love to think of the sinless little ones, whose pearly temples have here been laved at the baptismal font. I love to think of the weak, yet strong ones, who have tearfully tasted the consecrated cup, on which is written, "Do this in remembrance of me." I love to think of those self-forgetting, self-exiled, who, counting all things naught for Gethsemane's dear sake, are treading foreign shores, to say to the soul-fettered Pagan, "Behold the Lamb of God." I love to think of the loving hearts that at yonder altar have throbbed, side by side, while the holy man of God pronounced "the twain one." I love to think of the seraph smile of which death itself was powerless to rob the dead saint, over whose upturned face, to which the sunlight lent such mocking glow, the words, "Dust to dust," fell upon the pained ear of love. I love, as I sit here, to list through the half open vestry door, to the hymning voices of happy Sabbath scholars, sweet as the timid chirp of morn's first peeping bird. I love to hear their   THOUGHTS AT CHURCH.          41 tiny feet, as they patter down the aisle, and mark the earnest gaze of questioning childhood.

Does the laborer's "hire" come tardily and grudgingly to the overtasked, faithful servant? Do censorious, dissatisfied spirits watch and wait for his halting? Now he rises and says, slowly - musically, "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want." Why at such sweet, soul- resting words, do his tears overflow? Why has his voice such a heart quivers Ah! there is a vacant seat in the pas- tor's pew. A little golden head, that last Sabbath gladdened our eyes like a gleam of sunlight, lies dreamlessly pillowed be- neath the coffin lid; gleeful eyes have lost their brightness: cherry lips are wan and mute, and beneath her sable vail the lonely mother sobs. And so the father's lip quivers, and for a moment nature triumphs. Then athwart the gloomy cloud flashes the bow of promise. He wipes away the blinding tears, and with an angel smile, and upward glance, he says, "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in Him."  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7388-00000024"/> THE BROTHERS. CLOSE the door. One would scarcely think, in this luxurious atmosphere, that we had left mid-winter behind us. The warm air is heavy with the odor of blossoming greenhouse plants, over whose fragrant clusters a tiny fountain tosses its sparkling spray: bright-winged, sweet-voiced canaries dart, like flashes of sunlight, through the dark green foliage: beautiful are those sculptured infants, cheek to cheek, over whose dim- pled limbs the crimson drapery throws such a rosy glow: beau- tiful is that shrinking Venus, with her pure, chaste brow, and Eve-like grace: lovely those rare old pictures, to the artistic eye: beautiful that recumbent statuette of the peerless, proud "Pauline." Hush! tread softly; on yonder couch a gentleman lies sleeping. His crimson velvet cap has fallen back from his broad white forehead; his long curving lashes droop heavily upon his cheek, and his Grecian profile is as faultless as a sculp. tor's dream. Pity, that the stain of sensuality should have left so legible an impress there. A servant enters, bearing a note upon a silver tray. His master languidly opens a pair of large dark eyes, and beckons him to approach. As he breaks the seal, a contemptuous sneer   THE BROTHERS.           4 disfigures his handsome lip, and an angry flush mounts to his brow. Motioning the servant away, he crushes the note be- tween his fingers, muttering,-"No-no-as he has made his bed, so let him lie in it." Then walking once or twice rapidly across the room, he takes up a small volume, and throws himself again upon the velvet couch. He does not turn the leaves, and if you peep over his shoulder, you will see that the book is upside down. His thoughts are far away. He remembers a bright- eyed, open-browed, guileless-hearted brother, whom early or- phanage had thrown upon his fraternal care; whose trusting nature he had perverted; whose listening ear he had poisoned with specious sophistries and worldly maxims; whom he had introduced to the wine party, where female virtue was held in derision, and to the "green room," where the foreign danseuse understood well how to play her part; whom he had initiated into modem follies and dissipations, and then launched upon the Charybdis of fashionable society, without chart, or rudder, or compass, other than his own headstrong passions and unbri- dled will. Soon came a rumor, at first vague and undefined, and then voraciously seized upon and circulated by Paul Pry penny-a- liners, (who recked little, in their avidity for a paragraph, of broken-hearted mothers or despairing gray-haired fathers,) of a true heart that had been betrayed, of a disgraced household, of a fair brow that must henceforth walk the earth shame- branded. Then from his avenging pursuers the rash boy fled for refuge to him who had first turned his youthful footsteps aside from truth and honor. He was repulsed with scorn; not  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7388-00000025"/> "        THE -BROTHERS. because he had wronged his own soul and hers whose star had forever set in night, but because he had not more skilfully and secretly woven the meshes for his victim. Across the seas, amid the reckless debauchery of God-for- getting Paris, the miserable boy sought oblivion; welcoming with desperate eagerness the syren Pleasure, in every chame- leon shape that could stifle conscience or drown torturing mem- ory. Sometimes by a lucky throw of the dice he was enabled to shine as the Adonis of some ball, or theatre, or gay saloon: sometimes destitute as the humblest chiffonier, who suns himself in the public square, to solicit charity of the in- different passer-by. In the rosy glow of morning, the bright stars paled while Harry sat at the enticing gaming table, till even those accustomed to breathe the polluted atmosphere of those gates of perdition, turned shuddering away, from the fiendish look of that youthful face. Nature revenged herself at last. Wearisome days of sick- ness came, and he who was nurtured in luxury, was dependent upon the charity of grudging strangers. Oh! what a broad, clear beam eternity throws upon the crooked by-paths of sin! how like swift visions pass the long- forgotten prayer at the blessed mother's knee; the long-forgot- ten words of Holy Writ; the soothing vesper hymn, of holy time; the first cautious, retrograding step-the gradual searing of conscience, till the barrier between right and wrong is ruth- lessly trampled under foot; the broken resolutions, the mis- spent years, the wasted energies; the sins against one's own soul, the sins against others; the powerless wish to pray, 'mid   THE BROTHERS.            45 paroxysms of bodily pain; the Clinging hold on life - the anx- ious glance at the physician -the thrilling question, "Doctor, is it life or death?"

Through her representa- tions, on his partial restoration to health, a sufficient sum was subscribed by the American consul, and some of his generous countrymen, to give him the last chance for his life, by sending him to breath again his native air. Earnestly he prayed that the sea might not be his sepul hre. Tearfully he welcomed the first sight of his native shore. Tremblingly he penned those few lines to the brother whose face he so yearned to see - and on whose fraternal breast it would seem almost easy to die. Anxiously he waited the ret sult, turning restlessly from side to side, till beaded drops of agony started from his pallid temples. Walter would not re- fuse his last request. No - no.

"That s my own husband," said the happy Mary, as she saw him relent. "Go now, dear Walter.

He had at all times a nervous shrinking from sickness--a fastidious horror of what he termed " disagreeables." He half repented that he had suffered a woman's tears to unsettle his purpose. Perhaps Harry would reproach him. (His own conscience was prompt- er to that thought.) There he stood, irresolutely twirling Ma- ry's lovely flowers in his nervous grasp.

Curious, your husband always per- ceives that you are "sitting in a draft," whenever one of your old lovers approaches you in a concert room; curious he in- sists upon knowing who gave you that pretty gold ring on your little finger; curious that you can never open a package of old letters, without having his married eyes peeping over your shoulder; curious he never allows you to ride on horseback, though everybody says you have just the figure for it; curious he always sends his partner on all the little business trips of the firm; curious such an ugly frown comes over his face when he sees certain cabalistic marks in a masculine hand, in the margin of your favorite poet; curious that he will not let you name your youngest boy Harry, unless you tell him your con- fidential reasons; curious he is always most gracious to the most uninteresting men who visit the house; and very curious, and decidedly disagreeable, that whenever you ask him for money, he is so busy reading the newspaper that he can't hear you    THE ADVANTAGES OF A HOUSE IN A FASHONABLE SQUARE. "WHOM did you say wished to see me, Bridget?" The broad-faced Irish girl handed her mistress a card. "' Mrs. John Hunter!' was there ever anything so unfortu- nate? had she called on any other day in the week, I should have been prepared to receive her, but of a ' washing day,' when nothing but a calico wrapper stands Master George's clawings and climbings; when the nursery maid is in the kitch- en, and thebaby on my hands for the day; when my ' Honiton collar' is in soak, the parlor window curtains in the wash-tub, and the dimensions of the whole family, big and little, are flap- ping on the clothes-line, displaying their rents and patches in full view of the parlor windows!

What did she know about washing up breakfast-cups, polishing the silver sugar bowl, filling the astral lamp, counting up the silver forks and spoons, or mending that little threadbare place in the carpet, that would soon widen into an ugly rent, if neglected ? What did she know about washing children's faces for school, or finding their missing mittens, or seeing that Webster's spel- ling book and a big apple were safely stowed away in their satchels ? How did she (whose family broadcloth the tailor mended) know that Monday was always the day when hus. bands threw their coats into wives' lap " for just one stitch," (which translated, means new sleevelinings, new facings for the flaps, a new set of buttons down the front, and a general resus- citation of dilapidated button-holes.) How did she know that the baby always got up a fit of colic on washing days, and made it a point to dispense with its usual forenoon nap ?-that all the collectors for benevolent societies, and bores in general, preferred it to any other day in the calendar ? - that school teachers always selected it to ferule children for sneezing with- out permission -that milkmen never could spare you, on that day, your usual share of milk by two quarts - that the coal, potatoes, starch, soap, molasses, and vinegar always gave out on Monday-- that "the minister" always selected it for his   A HOUSE IN ST.

There she sat in the parlor taking notes, after the usual fash- ion of lady callers, while Mrs. John Smith hurriedly tied on her bonnet, to hide her disheveled tresses, threw on a shawl, and made her appearance in the parlor as if "just returned from a walk." How their tongues ran! how fashions and gossip were dis- cussed; how Mrs. Smith admired Mrs. Hunter's new dress hat; how the latter lady advised Mrs. Smith to "insist on her husband's moving from such an undesirable neighborhood into a more aristocratic locality;" and how Mrs. Smith wondered that the idea had never struck her before; and how Mrs. Hun- ter told her that of course Mr. Smith would refuse at first, but that she must either worry him into it, or seize upon some mo- ment of conjugal weakness to extort a binding promise from him to that effect; and how the little wife blushed to find her- self conniving at this feminine piece of diabolism. Mrs. John Smith's husband commenced life in a provision store. He was well acquainted with cleavers, white aprons, and spare-ribs -was on hand early and late to attend to busi- ness-trusted nobody--lived within his income, and conse- quently made money. Miss Mary Wood kept a dressmaker's establishment just over the way. Very industriously she sat through the long summer days, drooping her pretty golden ringlets over that never-ending succession of dresses. Patiently she "took in," and "let out," biased, flounoed, tucked, gathered and plaited, &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7388-00000029"/> 52    A HOUSE IN ST. JOHNIS SQUARE. at the weathercock option of her customers. Uneasily she leaned her head against her little window at sundown, and earnestly Mr. John Smith wished he could reprieve forever from such drudgery those taper little fingers. Very tempting was the little basket of early strawherries, covered with fresh green leaves, that went across the way to her one bright sum- mer morning--and as red as the strawherries, and quite as tempting, looked Miss Mary's cheek to Mr. John Smith, as she sat at the window, reading the little billet-doux which he slily tucked into one corner. The milkman wondered why Mr. Smith had grown so par- ticular about the flowers in the bouquets his little grand-daughter plucked for sale, and why there must always be " a rose-bud in it." Miss Rosa Violet could n't imagine what ailed her dress- maker, Miss Wood, (who was always so scrupulous in execu- ting orders,) to make her boddice round, when she told her so -particularly to make it pointed. The little sewing girls em- ployed in Miss Wood's shop were " afraid she was getting cra- zy," she smiled so often to herself, broke so many needles, and made so many mistakes in settling up their accounts on pay- day; and very great was their astonishment one day, after fin- ishing a pretty bridal dress, to find that Miss Wood was to wear it herself to church the very next Sunday! One bright June morning found the little dressmaker in a nice, two story brick house, furnished with every comfort, and some luxuries; for the warm-hearted John thought nothing half good enough for his little golden-haired bride. As time passed on, other little luxuries were added; including two nice, fat, dim-   A HOUSE HNST.

His table was well provided -the mother's and children's wardrobes ample, and not a husband in Yankee land was prouder or happier than John Smith, when on a sunshily Sunday, he walked to church with his pretty wife, whose golden curls still gleamed from beneath her little blue bonnet, followed by Katy and Georgy with their shining rosy faces, and pretty Sunday dresses. It was quite time the honeymoon should wane, but still it showed no signs of decrease. Little bouquets still perfumed Mary's room. John still sprung to pick up her handkerchief, or aid her in putting on her cloak or shawl. The anniver- sary of their wedding day always brought her a kind little note, with some simple remembrancer. Trifles, do you call these? Ah, a wife's happiness is made or marred by just such 4t' rifles." "Katy will make somebody's heart ache one of these days, said John Smith to his wife. Katy will be a beauty. Did you hear me, Mary 2 " "Yes," said Mary, drooping her bright ringlets till they swept John's cheek, "and I was thinking how I hoped she would marry well, and whether it would not be better for us to move into a more genteel neighborhood, and form a-new set of ac. quaintances." "My little wife getting ambitious!" said John, smoothing her  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7388-00000030"/> 54    A HOUSE IN ST.

"Yes; but my dear Mary, rents there are enormous, and those large houses require a greater outlay of money than you have any idea of. The furniture which looks pretty and in good taste here, would be quite shabby in such an elegant estab- lishment. The pretty de laine, which fits your little round fig- ure so charmingly, must give place to a silk or brocade. Katy and Georgy must doff their simple dresses, for velvet and em- broidery; broad-faced, red-fisted Bridget must make way for a French cook. The money which I have placed in the bank for a nest-egg for you and the children in case of my death, must be withdrawn to meet present demands. But we will talk of this another time: good-by Mary, dear; not even your dear face must tempt me away from  business; good-by," and he kissed his hand to her, as he walked rapidly out the door. But somehow or other Mary's words kept ringing in John's ears. It was very true Katy must be married some day, and then he ran over the circle of their acquaintance; the Stubbses, and the Joneses, and the Jenkinses-good enough in their way, but (he confessed to himself) not just the thing for his Katy. John was ambitious too: Mary was right; they ought to con- sider that Katy would soon be a woman. It is not to be supposed because John Smith never sported white kids, save on his wedding day, that he was not a man of   A HOUSE IN ST. JOHN'S SQUARE,       55 taste; by no means. Not an artistic touch of Mary's feminine fingers, from the twist of a ringlet or ribbon to the draping of a curtain, the judicious disposal of a fine engraving, or the harmonious blending of colors in a mantel bouquet, escaped him. It was his joy and pride to see her glide about his home, beau- tifying almost unconsciously everything she touched; and then, he remembered when'she was ill, and Bridget had the over- sight of the parlorS-what a different air they had; how awk- wardly the chairs looked plastered straight against the wall- how ugly the rfd cloth all awry on the centre table; what a string-y look the curtains had, after her clumsy fingers had passed over them. Yes, Mary would grace a house in St. John's Square, and if it would make her any happier to go there (and here he glanced at his ledger)-why, go she should-for she was just the prettiest, and dearest, and most loving little Mary who ever answered to that poetical name. What would full coffers avail him, if Mary should die?-and she might die first. His health was good-his business was good. Mary and Katy should live in St. John's Square. Mary and Katy did live in St. John's Square. The uphol- sterer crammed as many hundreds as possible into the drawing rooms, in the shape of vis-a-vis antique chairs, velvet sofas, dam- ask curtains, mirrors, tapestry, carpets, and a thousand other nick-nacks, too numerous to mention: then the blinds and cur- tains shut out the glad sunlight, lest the warm beams should fade out the rich tints of the carpets and curtains, and left it as fine and as gloomy as any other fashionable drawing room. There was a very pretty prospect from Mary's chamber win- I   &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7388-00000031"/> 56    A HOUSE IN ST.

The Smiths took their meals in a gloomy basement, where gas was indispensable at mid-day. Mary was constantly in fear that the servants would spoil the pictures and statues in the parlor, so she concluded to sweep and dust it herself before there was any probability of Mrs. John Hunter's being awake in the morning. As this was something of a tax, she and Mr. Smith and the children kept out of it, except on Sundays and when company called, burrowing under ground the residue of the time in the afore-mentioned basement. Directly opposite Mrs. Smith lived Mrs. Vivian Grey, the leader of the aristocracy (so Mrs. Hunter informed her) in St. John's Square. It was a great thing to be noticed by Mrs. Vivian Grey. Mrs. Hunter sincerely hoped she would patron- ise Mrs. Smith. Mrs. Hunter, after a minute survey, pro- nounced Mrs. Smith's establishment quite conmme il faut, but suggested that a real cachemire should be added as soon as possible to Mrs. Smith's wardrobe, as Mrs. Grey considered that article quite indispensable to a woman of fashion. She also suggested that Mrs. Smith should delicately hint to her husband the propriety of his engaging a man servant, which ap- pendage was necessary to give a certain distinguZ finish to the establishment; an Irishman would do, if well trained, but a black man was more fashionable, provided he was not green- and Mrs. Hunter smiled at her own wit. The cachemire was added- so was the black servant-man. **   A HOUSE IN ST. JOHN'S SQUARE.       57 Katy no longer skipped and jumped, but minced in corsets and whalebone. She never ate unless at a private lunch with mamma. Mr. John Smith staid late at his counting-room, and looked anxious, and two ugly lines made their appearance on Mrs. Mary's fair forehead. The French cook gave away pro- visions enough to feed an entire family of French emigrants. The black man-servant pulled up his dicky and informed Mrs. Smith that it was at the price of his reputation to live with a family who dispensed with the use of finger bowls, and the house-maid (who had the honor of being descended from the establishment of Mrs. Vivian Grey) declined remaining with a family who did n't keep a private carriage. Mrs. Vivian Grey was not baited by the real cachemire, and her son, little Julius Grey, a precocious youth of ten, told little George Smith- that his mamma had forbidden higp playing mar- bles with a boy whose father had kept a provision store. A scurrilous penny paper published a burlesque of Mrs. Smith's first grand party, on the coming out of Miss Katy, in which, among other allusions to Mr. Smith's former occupa- tion, the ball-room was said to be "elegantly festooned with sausages." This added " the last ounce to the camel's back; " even Mrs. Hunter's tried friendship was not proof against such a test. A council of war was called. Mrs. Smith begged her hus- band, as her repentant arms encircled his dicky, to buy a place in the country. John very gladly consented to turn his plebeian back forever on the scene of their humiliation; and what with  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7388-00000032"/> 58    A HOUSE IN ST.

"THE OTHER SEX." "Let cynics prattle as they may, our existence here, without the presence of the other sex, would be only a dark and cheerless void." Which " other sex?" Don't be so obscure. Dr. Beecher says, " that a writer's ideas should stand out like rabbits' ears, so that the reader can get hold of them." If you allude to the female sex, I don't subscribe to it. I wish they were all "translated."  If there is anything that gives me the sensations of a landsman on his first sea voyage, it is the sight of a bonnet. Think of female friendship! Two women joining the Mutual Admiration Society; emptying their budget of love affairs; comparing bait to entrap victims; sighing over the same rose leaf; sonnetizing the same moonbeam; patronizing the same milliner, and exchanging female kisses! (Betty, hand me my fan!) -Well, let either have one bonnet or one lover more than the other - or, if they are blue stockings, let either be one round the higher on Fame's ladder--bodkins and darning needles! what a tempest! - Caps and characters in such a case are of no account at all.

It makes me clap my hands to think of it. The only woman in the world! If it were I, should n't they all leave off smoking, and wearing those odious plaid con- tinuations? Should they ever wear an outside coat, with the flaps cut off, or a Kossuth hat, or a yellow Marseilles vest? - or a mammoth bow on their neck-ties; or a turnover dickey; or a watch-chain; or a ring on the little finger?- or any other abomination or off-shoot of dandyism whatsoever? Should n't I politely request them all to touch their hats, instead of jerking their heads, when they bowed? Wouldn't I coax them to read me poetry till they had the bronchitis? Would n't they play on the flute, and sing the soul out of me? And then if they were sick, would n't I pet them, and tell them all sorts of comicalities, and make time fly like the mischief?

It will take me to take the wind out of her sails. I 'll dissect her, before I'm a day older, as sure as my name is Ezekiel Broadbrim. I don't approve her style; never did. It's astonishing to me that the editor of The Green Twig dare countenance it, when he knows a man of my influence could annihilate her with one stroke of my pen. She has talent of a certain inferior order, but nothing to speak of. She's an unsafe model to follow; will lead her tribe of imitators into tremendous mistakes.

Every stroke of it will tell."   WILLY GREY. ,A STERN, unyielding, line-and-plummet, May-flower descend- ant, was old Farmer Grey, of Allantown, Connecticut. -Many a crop had he planted,- many a harvest had he garnered in, since he first became owner of Glen Farm. During that time, that respected individual, " the oldest inhabitant,' could not remem- ber ever to have seen him smile. The village children shied close to the stone wall, and gave him a wide berth, when he passed. Even the cats and dogs laid their ears back, and crept circumspectly by him, with one eye on his whip-lash. Farmer Grey considered it acceptable to the God who painted the rainbow, and expanded the lily, and tinted the rose, to walk the bright earth with his head bowed like a bulrush, and his soul clad in sackcloth. No mercy fell from the lips of his imaginary Saviour; no compassion breathed in His voice; no love beamed in His eye; His sword of justice was never  sheathed. The old, farmer's wife was a gentle, dependent creature, a delicate vine, springing up in a sterile soil, reaching forth its tendrils vainly, for some object to cling to. God, in his mercy, twined them lovingly around a human blossom. Little Willy partook of his mother's sensitive, poetical nature. A yearning 5b  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7388-00000036"/> "         WILLY GREY. spirit looked out from the fathomless depths of his earnest eyes. Only eight short summers the gentle mother soothed her boy's childish pains, and watched his childish slumbers. While he grew in strength and beauty, her eye waxed dim, and her step grew slow and feeble. And so sweet memories were only left to little Willy,- dear, loving eyes, whose glance ever met his on waking; a fair, caressing hand, that wiped away his April tears; a low, gentle voice, sweet to his childish ear as a seraph's hymning. Willy's father told him that "his mother had gone to Heaven," John, the plough-boy, said "she was lying in the church- yard." Willy could not understand this. He only knew that the house had grown dark and empty, and that his heart ached when he stayed there; and so he wandered out in the little garden, (his mother's garden;) but the flowers looked dreary, too; and her pretty rose-vine lay trailing its broken buds and blighted blossoms in the dust. Then Willy crept up to his father's side, and looked up in his face, but there was something there that made him afraid to lay his little hand upon his knee, or climb into his lap, or in any way unburden his little heart; so he turned away, more sorrowful than before, and wandered into his mother's chamber, and climbed up in her chair, and opened her drawer, to look at her comb and hair brush; and then he went to the closet, and passed his little hand, caressingly, over her empty dresses, and leaning his little curly head against them, sobbed himself to sleep. By and by, as years passed on, and the child grew older, he   WILLY GREY.           67 learned to wander out in the woods and fields, and unbosomhis little yearning heart to Nature. Reposing on her breast, lis. tening to the music of her thousand voices, his unquiet spirit was soothed as with a mother's lullaby. With kindling eye, he watched the vivid lightnings play; or, saw the murky east flush, like a timid bride, into rosy day; or, beheld the shining folds of western clouds fade softly into twilight; or, gazed at the Queen of Night, as she cut her shining path through the cloudy sky; or, questioned, with earnest eyes, the glittering stars. All this but ill pleased the old farmer. He looked upon the earth only with an eye to tillage; upon the sloping hill, with its pine-crowned summit, only with an eye to timber; upon the changeful skies, only as reservoirs for moistening and warm- ing his crops; upon the silver streams, that laced the emerald meadows, only as channels for irrigation; upon the climbing vine, as an insidious foe to joists, and beams, and timbers; and upon flowers, only- as perfumed aristocrats, crowding and over-topping the free-soil democracy of cabbage, onions, and potatoes. In vain poor Will tried to get up, " to order," an enthusiasm for self-acting hay-cutters, patent plows, rakes, hoes, and har- rows. In vain, when Sunday came, and he was put "on the limits," did the old farmer, with a face ten-fold more ascetic than the cowled monk, strive to throw a pall of gloom over that free, glad spirit, by rehearsing, in his ear, a creed which would forever close the gate of heaven on every dissenter, or inculcate doctrines, which, if believed, would fill our lunatic asylums with the frantic wailings of despair.  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7388-00000037"/> 68         WILLY GREY. Restlessly did Will, with cramped limbs and fettered spirit, sit out the tedious hours of that holy day, which should be the "most blessed of all the seven," and watch, with impatient eye, the last golden beam of the Sabbath sun sink slowly down be- hind the western hills. Oh, well-meaning, but mistaken, parent! let but one loving smile play over those frigid lips: let but one tear of sympathy flood that stony eye: let but one drop from that overflowing fountain of love, that wells up in the bosom of the Infinite, moisten the parched soil of that youthful heart! Open those arms but once, and clasp him to the paternal heart; for even now, his chafed spirit, like a caged bird, flutters against its prison bars; even now, the boy's unquiet ear catches the far-off hum of the busy world: even now, his craving heart beats wildly for the voice of human love! Weary feet, houseless nights, the scant meal, and the oft repulsed request: what are they to the strong nerve, and bound- ing pulse, and hopeful heart of the young adventurer? Laurel wreaths, dizzy places on Ambition's heights, have not its aspi- rants reached them by just such rugged steps? "Will" is in the city. Will sits upon the steps of the New York City Hall, reading a penny paper: he has begged it from a good-natured newsboy, who has also shared with him a huge slice of gingerbread. As Will's eye glances over the sheet, it falls upon the following paragraph:   WILLY GREY.           69 "PROSPECTUS OF THE WEEKLY CHRONICLE. "The Weekly Chronicle is a paper founded on the demands of the age for a first-class journal. It soars above all sectional and personal considerations, and fearlessly proffers its feeble aid, in developing the natural resources of the country, fostering the genius of the people; rewarding meritorious effort in every department of art, exalting virtue, however humble, and con- founding vice, however powerful. The editor and proprietor of the Chronicle is Mr. Philanthropas Howard; office, No. 199 Cloud-street. "Boy wanted immediately at the above office: one from the country would be preferred." Will threw down the paper, and started to his feet: "199 Cloud-street?"He asked orange-women; he asked image-boys; he asked merchants; he asked clerks; he asked lawyers; he asked clients; he investigated cellars; he explored attics; he traveled through parks, and through alleys; till finally, he coaxed a graceless, bare-footed urchin to shew him the way. Mr. John Howard, editor and proprietor of the Weekly Chronicle, went upon the principle of paying nothing where no. thing would pay, and paying as little as possible where he could get something for next to nothing. It was a fixed principle and confirmed practice with him, never to pay anything for contri- butions to the Chronicle. He considered that the great ad- vantage that would accrue to an author from having his or her  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7388-00000038"/> 70         WILLY GREY. articles in his paper, would be ample remuneration. At the moment Will's eye first fell upon him, he was reposing in a huge leathern arm chair, in the corner of his sanctum. His proportions very much resembled an apoplectic bag of' flour, surmounted by an apple. His head was ornamented with sparse spires of fiery red hair; on his cheeks, a pair of cream- colored whiskers were feebly struggling into life; and sundry tufts of the same color, under his chin, shadowed forth his editorial sympathy with the recent "Beard Movement." Before him was a table, of doubtful hue and architecture, laden with manu- scripts, accepted, rejected, and under consideration; letters of all sizes, opened and unopened, prepaid and unpaid, saucy and silly, defiant and deprecatory. There was also an inkstand, crusted with dirt and cobwebs; a broken paper weight, pinning down some bad money, paid by distant subscribers; a camphene lamp, with a broken pedestal, propped up by a Directory on one side, and Walker's Dictionary on the other; sundry stumps of cigars; a half-eaten apple; a rind of an orange; a lady's glove, and a box of bilious pills. Will stepped before him, and made known his errand. Mr. John Howard looked at him, with a portentous scowl, inspected him very much as he would a keg of doubtful mackerel, and then referred him to the foreman of the office, Mr. Jack Punch. Jack had beed victimized, in the way of office boys, for an in- definite period, with precocious city urchins, who smoked long nines, talked politics, discussed theatricals, and knew more of city haunts than the police themselves. Of course he lost no time in securing a boy to whose verdant feet the plow-soil was   WILLY GREY,           71 still clinging. Will's business was to open the office at half past six in the mor-ning, sweep it outt,make the fires, go to the post-office for letters and exchanges, wrap up papers for new subscribers, carry them to the post, and see that the mail was properly " got off." To all these requirements, Will immedi- ately subscribed. On Will's daily tramps to and from the office, he was obliged to pass Lithe &amp; Co.'s magnificent show window, where the choicest pictures and engravings were constantly exposed for sale. There he might be seen loitering, entranced and spell- bound, quite oblivious of the Chronicle, hour after hour, weav- ing bright visions--building air castles, with which his over- seer, Mr. Jack Punch, had little sympathy. Yes; Will had at length found out what he was made for. He knew now why he had lain under the trees, of a bright summer day, watching the fleecy clouds go sailing by, in such a dreamy rapture; why the whispering leaves, and waving fields of grain, and drooping branches of graceful trees, and the mirror-like beauty of the placid lake, reflecting a mimic heaven; why the undulating hills, and mist-wreathed valleys, with their wealth of leaf, and buds and blossom, filled his eyes with tears and his soul with untold joy, and why, when slumber sealed each weary lid under the cottage eaves, he stood alone, hushing his very breath, awe- struck, beneath the holy stars.     * Poor Will, his occupation became so distasteful! Poor Will, winged for a " bird of paradise," and forced to be a mole, bur- rowing under the earth, when he would fain try his new-found pinions! To Jack's intense disgust, he soon detected Will in  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7388-00000039"/> 72         WILLY GREY. drawing rude sketches on bits of paper, stray wrappers, and backs of letters; even the walls were " done in cray- ons," by the same mischievous fingers. His vision was so filled "with the curved line of beauty," that he was constantly com- mitting the most egregious blunders. He misplaced the bun- dles of newspapers which he carried to the post-office; placing the " north " packages on the " south " table, the east on the north, the south on the east, &amp;c.; mixing them up generally and indescribably and inextricably, so that the subscribers to the "Weekly Chronicle " did not receive their papers with that precision and regularity which is acknowledged to be desi- rable, particularly in small country places, where the black- smith's shop, the engine house, and " the newspaper " form a trio not to be despised by the simple-hearted, primitive farmers. Jack, whose private opinion it was that he should have been christened Job, being obliged to shoulder all the short-comings of his assistants, and being worked up to a pitch of frenzy by letters from incensed subscribers, which Mr. Howard constantly thrust in his face, very unceremoniously ejected Will from the premises, one morning, by a vigorous application of the toe of his boot. The world was again a closed oyster to Will. How to open it? that was the question. Our hero thought the best place to consider the matter was at "Lithe &amp; Co.'s shop-win- dow. Just as he reached it, a gentleman passed out of the shop, followed by a lad bearing a small framed landscape. Perhaps the gentleman was an artist! Perhaps he could employ him in some way! Will resolved to follow him.   WILLY GREY.           73 Up one street and down another, round comers and through squares-the gentleman's long legs seemed to be shod with the famed seven-leagued boots. At length he stopped before the door of an unpretending looking building, and handing the lad who accompanied him a bit of money, he took from him the picture, and was just springing up the steps, when he lost his balance, and the picture was jerked violently from his hand, but only to be caught by the watchful Will, who restored it to its owner uninjured. "Thank you, my boy," said the gentleman, " you have done me a greater service than you think for;" at the same time offering him some money. "No, I thank you," said Will, proudly. "I do not wish to be paid for it." "As you please, Master Independence," replied the gentle- man, laughing; " but is there no other way I can serve you?" "Are you an artist 2 " asked Will. "The gentleman raised his eyebrows, with a comical air, and replied, "Well, sometimes I think I am, and then, again, I don't know; but what if I were?" "I should so like to be an artist," said Will, the quick flush mounting to his temples. "You!" exclaimed the gentleman, taking a minute survey of Will's nondescript toute ensemble, "Do you ever draw?" "Sometimes," replied Will, " when I can get a bit of char- coal, and a white wall. I was just kicked out of the Chroni- cle office for doing it."  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7388-00000040"/> 74         WILLY GREY. "Follow me," said the gentleman, tapping him familiarly on the cheek. Will needed no second invitation. Climbing one flight of stairs, he found himself in a small studio, lined on all sides by pictures; some finished and framed, others in various stages of progression. Pallets, brushes, and crayons, lay scattered round an easel; while in one corner was an artist's lay figure, which, in the dim light of the apartment, Will mistook for the artist's wife, whose presence he respectfully acknowledged by a profound bow, to the infinite amusement of his patron. Mr. Lester was delighted with Will's naive criticisms on his pictures, and his profound reverence for art. A few days found him  quite domesticated in his new quarters; and months passed by swift as a weaver's shuttle, and found him as happy as a crowned prince; whether grinding colors for the artist, or watching the progress of his pencil, or picking up stray crumbs of knowledge from the lips of connoisseurs, who daily frequented the studio; and many a rough sketch did Will make in his little corner, that would have made them open their critical eyes wide with wonder. "What a foolish match!"Was an engagement ever an- nounced that did not call forth this remark, from some dissent- ing lip Perhaps it was a "foolish match." Meta had no dower but her beauty, and Will had no capital but his pallet and easel. The gossips said she " might have done much bet- ter." There was old Mr. Hill, whose head was snow white,   WILLY GREY.           75 but whose gold was as yellow and as plenty as Meta's bright ringlets; and Mr. Vesey, whose father made a clergyman of him, because he did n't know enough to be a merchant; and Lawyer Givens, with his carrotty head and turn-up nose, and chin that might have been beat; and Falstaff-iau Captain Reef, who brought home such pretty china shawls and grass, cloth dresses, and who had as many wives as a Grand Turk. Meta might have had any one of these by hoisting her little fin- ger. Foolish Meta! money and misery in one scale, poverty and love in the other. Miserable little Meta! And yet she does not look so very miserable, as she leans over her husband's shoulder, and sees the landscape brighten on the canvass, or presses her rosy lips to his forehead, or arranges the fold of a curtain for the desired light and shade, or grinds his colors with her own dainty little fingers; no, she looks anything but mis- erable with those soft eyes so full of light, and that elastic step, and voice of music, that are inspiration to her artist husband. No; she thinks the " old masters" were fools to her young master, and she already sees the day when his studio will be crowded with connoisseurs and patrons, and his pictures bring him both fame and fortune; and then, they will travel in for- eign countries, and sleep under Italia's soft blue skies, and see the Swiss glaciers, and the rose-wreathed homes of England, and the grim old chateaux of France, and perhaps beard old Haynau in his den. Who knows? Yes; and Will should feast his eyes on beauty, and they'd be as happy, as if care and sor- row had never dimmed a bright eye with tears, since the ser- aph stood, with a flaming sword, to guard the gate of Eden.  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7388-00000041"/> 76         WILLY GREY. Hopeful, happy, trusting Meta! the bird's carol is not sweeter than yours;-and yet the archer takes his aim, and with broken wing it flutters to the ground. Yes: Meta was an angel. Will said it a thousand times a day, and his eyes repeated it when his tongue was silent. Meta's brow, and cheelk, and lips, and tresses were multi- plied indefinitely, in all his female heads. Her dimpled hand, her round arm, her plump shoulder, her slender foot, all served him for faultless models. Life was so beautiful to him now! his employment so con- genial, his heart so satisfied. It must be that he should succeed. The very thought of failure- "l but then, he should not fail!" Poor Will! he had yet to learn that garrets are as often the graves as the nurseries of genius, and that native talent goes unrecognized until stamped with foreign approbation. I1ap- pily --hopefully - heroically he toiled on; morning's earliest beam, and day's last lingering ray finding him busy at his easel. But, alas! as time passed, though patrons came not, creditors did; and one year after their marriage, Meta might have been seen stealthily conveying little parcels back and forth to a small shop in the neighborhood, where employment was furnished for needy fingers. It required all her feminine tact and diplomacy to conceal from Will her little secret, or to hide the tell-tale blush, when he noticed the disappearance of her wedding ring, which now lay glittering in a neighboring pawn-broker's window; yet never for an instant, since the little wife first slept on Will's heart, had she one misgiving that she had placed her happiness unalterably in his keeping.   WILLY GREY.     -      " Oh, inscrutable womanhood! Pitiful as the heart of God, when the dark cloud of. misfortune, or shame, bows the strong frame of manhood; merciless--vindictive-implacable as the Prince of Darkness, towards thy tempted, forsaken and sor- rowing sisters! The quick eye of affection was not long in discovering Meta's secret; and now every glance of love, every caress, every en- dearing tons of Meta's, gave Will's heart a sorrow pang. Meta! who had turned a deaf ear to richer lovers, to share his heart and home; Meta! whose beauty might grace a court, whose life should be all sunshine: that Meta's bright eyes should dim, her cheek pale, her step grow prematurely slow and. faltering, for him! - the thought was torture. "To-morrow, Will-you said to-morrow," said Meta, hiding her tears on her husband's shoulder; " the land of gold is also the land of graves,' and she gazed mournfully into his face. "Dear Meta," said her husband, " do not unman me with your tears; our parting will be brief, and I shall return to you with gold-gold! Meta; and you shall yet have a home worthy of you. Bear up, dear Meta--the sun will surely break through the cloud rift. God bless and keep my darling wife." Poor little Meta! for hours she sat stupefied with sorrow, in the same spot where Will had left her. The sun shone  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7388-00000042"/> 78         WILLY GE Y. cheerfully in at the little window of her new home, but its beams brought no warmth to Meta's heart. The clinging clasp of Will's arms was still about her neck: Will's kiss was still warm upon her lips, and yet-- she was alone. She thought, with a shudder, of the treacherous sea; of. the pestilence that walketh in darkness; of a sick-bed, on a foreign shore; of the added bitterness of the death pang, when the eye looks vainly for the one loved face; and bowing her face in her hands, she wept convulsively. "Dear heart! Goodness alive!" said Meta's landlady, peep. ing in at the door. DI)o n't take on so; bless me, how long have you been married? you're nothing better than a child now. Why did n't you go to Californy with your husband? Where's your folks? - whose picter is that . Ah! I see now, it is meant for you. But why did n't you have on a gown, dear, instead of being wrapped up in them clouds? It makes you look like a sperit.

Well, if you won't come down stairs I must leave you, for I smell my bread burning; but do cheer up - you look as lonesome as a pigeon on a spout of a rainy day." A letter from the best beloved! How our eye lingers on the well-known characters. How we torture the words to ex- tract hidden meanings. How tenderly we place it near the heart, and under the pillow. How lingeringly comes the daylight, when our waiting eyes would re-peruse what is already ihdeli. bly written on the heart! Will's voyage had been prosperous - his health was good- his hope and courage unabated. Meta's eye sparkled, and her cheek flushed like a rose, as she pressed the letter again and again to her lips; but, after all, it was only a letter, and time dragged so heavily. Meta was weary of sewing, weary of read- ing, weary of watching endless pedestrians pass and repass be- neath her window, and when twilight came, with its deepening shadows-that hour so sweet to the happy, so fraught with gloom  to the wretched-and Meta's eye fell upon the little house opposite, and saw the little parlor lamp gleam like a beacon light for the absent husband, while the happy wife glided about with busy hands',and lightsome step, and when, at  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7388-00000043"/> 80         WILLY GREY. last, he came, and the broken circle was complete, poor Meta turned away to weep. Joy, Meta, joy! dry your tears!  Will has been suc- cessful. Will is coming home. Even now the Sea-Gull plows the waves, with its precious living freight. Lucky Will! he has " found gold," but it was dug from " the mine " of the artist's brain. Magical Will! the liquid eyes and graceful limbs of Senor Alvarez's only daughter are reproduced on canvas, in all their glowing beauty, by your magic touch! The Senor is rich-the Senor is liberal -the Senor's taste is as unimpeachable as his credit- the Senor has pronounced Will " a genius." Other Senors hear it; other Senors have gold in plenty, and dark-eyed, graceful daughters, whose charms Will perpetuates, and yet fails to see, for a sweeter face which comes between. Dry your tears, little Meta-- smooth the neglected ringlets - don his favorite robe, and listen with a flushed cheek, a beat- ing heart and a love-lit eye, for the long absent but well remem- bered footstep. Ah! Meta, there are meetings that overpay the pain of part- ing. But, dear Reader, you and I are de trop. You should have seen how like a little brigand Will looked, with his bronzed face and fierce beard and mustache-so fierce that Meta was half afraid to jump into his arms; you should have seen Meta's new home to know what a pretty little nest love and taste may weave for a cherished bird; you   WIL LY GREY.          81 should have seen with what a Midas touch Will's gold suddenly opened the eyes of people to his wonderful merit, as an artist; how "patrons " flocked in, now that he lived in a handsome house in Belgrave Square; how Mr. Jack Punch repented with crocodile tears, that he had ever kicked him out of " the Chron- icle office," and how Will immortalized him on canvas, in the very act; not forgetting to give due prominence, in the fore. ground, to the figure of his philanthropic employer, Mr. John Howard, who, in the touching language of his Prospectus, always made it a point to " exalt virtue, however humble!" 6b  &#xD;<pb n="82 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC7388-00000044"/> TABITHA TOMPKINS' SOLILOQUY.

Well, well; one wouldn't think it, to see all the fine glittering things down in the drawing-room. Master's span of horses, and Miss Clara's diamond ear-rings, and mistresses rich dresses. I try to think it is all right, but it is no use. To-morrow is Sunday-" day of rest," I believe they call it. H-u-m-p-h! - more cooking to be done - more company more confusion than on any other day in the week. If I own a soul I have not heard how to take care of it for many a long day. Wonder if my master and mistress calculate to pay me for that, if I lose it? It is a question in my mind. Land of Goshen! I aint sure I've got a mind - there's the bell again!   CRITICS. "Bilious wretches, who abuse you because you write better than they." SLANDER and detraction! Even I, Fanny, know better than that. I never knew an editor to nib his pen with a knife as sharp as his temper, and write a scathing criticism on a book, because the authoress had declined contributing to his paper. I never knew a man who had fitted himself to a promiscuous coat, cut out in merry mood by taper fingers, to seize his por- cupine quill, under the agony of too tight a self-inflicted fit, to annihilate the offender. I never saw the bottled-up hatred of years, concentrated in a single venomous paragraph. I never heard of an unsuccessful masculine author, whose books were drugs in the literary market, speak with a sneer of successful literary feminity, and insinuate that it was by accident, not ge- nius, that they hit the popular favor! By the memory of "seventy-six," No! Do you suppose a man's opinions are in the market--to be bought and sold to the highest bidder? Do you suppose he would laud a vapid book, because the fashionable authoress once laved his toadying temples with the baptism of upper-tendom? or, do you sup. pose he'd lash a poor, but self-reliant wretch, who had presumed  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7388-00000048"/> 88          CRITICS. to climb to the topmost round of Fame's ladder, without his royal permission or assistance, and in despite of his repeated attempts to discourage her? No--no--bless your simple soul; a man never stoops to a meanness. There never was a criticism yet, born of envy, or malice, or repulsed love, or disappointed ambition. No-- no. Thank the gods, I have a more exalted opinion of masculinity.   FORGETFUL HUSBANDS.

"Write your brow" with anything else but your " troubles," if you do not wish to be left solus. You have no idea how "good people " will pity you when you tell your doleful ditty! They will "'pray for you," give you advice by the bushel, "feel for you"- everywhere but in their pocket- books; and wind up by telling you to " trust in Providence;" to all of which you feel very much like replying as the old lady did when she found herself spinning down hill in a wagon, "I trusted in Providence till the tackling broke!" Now, listen to me; -just go to work and hew out a path for yourself; get your head above water, and then snap your fingers in their pharisaical faces! Never ask a favor until you are drawing your last breath; and never forget one. "Write your troubles on your brow?" That man was either a knave, or, what is worse, a fool.

Don't you and I, and all the world know, that old Allen has a mortgage on his house, and that he never has a dollar by him longer than five minutes at a time. Is n't it extraordinary, Mr. Stubbs?" "Not at all--not at all--my dear," said Mr. Stubbs, knocking the ashes from his Havana; " to an editor all things are possible ;" and he unfolded the damp sheets of the Family Gazette, of which Mr. Simpkins was editor, and commenced reading aloud the following paragraph: "We yesterday had the gratification of visiting the celebrated establishment of the far-famed Inman &amp; Co., Hatters, No. 1" Wideway. We pronounce their new style of spring hat, for lightness, beauty, and durability, to be unrivaled; it is aptly designated the 'Count D'Orsay hat.'

There is a je ne sais quoi about their hats, which can be found nowhere else in the city."   HOW THE WIRES ARE PU-L-L.3    .    93 "Well, I don't see," said Mrs. Stubbs, "H" "Sh-! sh--!

There is science wagging in the very tails of Mr. Willcut's coats; in fact, he may be said to be the only tailor in the city, who is a thorough artist. His pantaloons are the knee-plus-ultra of shear-dom. Mr. Willcut has evidently made the anatomy of masculinity a study-hence the admirable result. The most casual observer, on noticing Mr. Willcut's fine phrenological developments, would at once negative the possibility of his making a faux pas on broadcloth." "Keep quiet, Mrs. Stubbs; listen:" "The St. Lucifer Hotel is a palatial wonder; whether we consider the number of acres it covers, the splendor of its mar- ble exterior, the sumptuousness of its drawing rooms, or the more than Oriental luxuriousness of its sleeping apartments, the tapestry, mirrors and gilding of which remind one forcibly of the far-famed Tuileries. The host of the St. Lucifer is-an Apollo in person, a Chesterfieldi in manners, and a Lucullus in taste; while those white-armed Houris, the female waiters, lap the soul in Elysium." Mr. Stubbs lifted his spectacles to his forehead, crossed his legs, and nodded knowingly to Mrs. Stubbs. "That's the way it's done, Mrs. Stubbs.

This, now, is a regular stroke of genius. He does it by two words. In all account of his visit to the Sybil's Cave, in which he says, 'MrY FRIEND, the blacksmith, and I soon found the spot,' &amp;c., (bah!) Then here is something that will interest you, my dear, on the other page of the Gazette. Mr. Simpkins has used up the dictionary in a half-column announcement of Miss Taffety (the milliner's) 'mag- nificent opening at --- street.' (Of course she made his wife a present of a new Paris bonnet.") "Well, I never-- said the simple Mrs. Stubbs.

S-t-u-b-b-s!" said her husband, in an oracular tone, "to conduct a newspaper requires a degree of tact, enterprise and ability to which Jotham Stubbs unfortunately is a stranger. The Family Gazette or its founder is by no means a fair sample of our honorable newspapers, and their upright, intelligent, and respected editors. Great Caesar! --no!" said Stubby, rising from his chair, and bringing his hand down emphatically on his corduroys, "no more than you are a fair sample of feminine beauty, Mrs. Stubbs!"   WHO WOULD BE THE LAST MAN? "Fanny Fern says, 'If there were but one woman in the world, the men would have a terrible time.' Fanny is right; but we would ask her what kind of a time the womean would have if there were but one man in existence?" WHAT kind of a time would they have? Why, of course no grass would grow under their slippers! The "Wars of the Roses," the battles of Waterloo and Bunker Hill would be a farce to it. Black eyes would be the rage, and both caps and characters would be torn to tatters. I imagine it would not be much of a millennium, either, to the moving cause of the disturbance. He would be as crazy as a fly in a drum, or as dizzy as a bee in a ten-acre lot of honeysuckles, uncertain where to alight.  He'd roll his bewildered eyes from one ex. quisite organization to another, and frantically and diplomati- cally exclaim--"How   happy could I be with either, were t'other dear charmer away!"                . "What kind of a time would the women have, were there only one man in the world?" What kind of a time would they have? What is that to me?  They might "take their own time," every "Miss Lucy" of them, for all I should care; and so might the said man him- self; for with me, the limited supply would not increase the value of the article.  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7388-00000052"/> "ONLY A COUSIN."

Then you make a foray into her work-basket, tangling spools most un- mercifilly, and reading over all the choice bits of poetry that women are so fond of clipping from the newspapers.

Your aunt is very oblivious, and wouldn't mind it if you occasionally lost the thread of your discourse.

And I noticed that his wife often touched his foot with her slipper under the table. What do you suppose she did that for . Just as I was buttoning up my coat to come away, I asked Tom if he would go to up Tammany Hall with me.

So thought her mother, as she glided gently in, to give her a silent, good-night blessing. The bright flush of youth, and hope was on her cheek. Her long dark hair lay in masses about her neck and shoulders; a smile played upon the red lips, and the mother bent low to catch the indistinct murmur. She starts, at the whispered name, as if a serpent had stung her; and as the little snowy hand is tossed restlessly upon the coverlid, she sees, glittering in the moonbeams, on that childish finger, the golden signet of betrothal. Sleep sought in vain to woo the eyes of the mother that night. Re- proachfully she asked herself, "How wuld I have been so blind? (but then Effie has seemed to me only a child!) But he! oh, no; the wine-cuip will be my child's rival; it must not be." Effie was wilful, and Mrs. May knew she must be cau- tiously dealt with; but she knew, also, that no mother need despair, who possesses the affection of her child. Effie's violet eyes opened to greet the first ray of the morn- ing sun, as he peeped into her room. She stood at the little mirror, gathering up, with those small hands, the rich treases   "OVE AND--DUTY.         Ill so impatient of confinement.

Stay! a hand is laid lightly upon her arm, and the pleading voice of a mother arrests that springing step.

A shadow passed over Effie's face; the little cherry lips pouted, and a rebellious feeling was busy at her heart; - but one look in her mother's pale face decided her, and, untying the strings of her hat, she leaned her head caressingly upon her mother's shoulder. "You are ill, dear mother; you are trobled;' and she looked inquiringly up into her face. "Listen to me, -Effie, I have a story to tell you of myself: When I was about your age, I formed an acquaintance with a youngman,bythename of Adolph. Hehad been buta short time in the village, but long enough to win the hearts of half the young girls, from their rustic admirers. Handsome, frank and social, he found himself everywhere a favorite.

My parents knew nothing to his disadvantage, and were equally charmed as myself with his cultivated refine- ment of manner, and the indefinable interest with which he invested every topic, grave or gay, which it suited his mood to discuss. Before I knew it, my heart was no longer in my own keeping. One afternoon, he called to accompany me upon a little excursion, we had planned together. As he came up the gravel walk, I noticed that his fine hair was in disorder: a pang, keen as death, shot through my heart, when he approached me, with reeling, unsteady step, and stammering tongue. I could not speak. The chill of death gathered round my heart. I fainted. When I recovered, he was gone, and my mother's face was bending over me, moist with tears. Her woman's heart knew all that was passing in mine. She pressed her lips to my forehead, and only said,' God strengthen you to choose the right, my child.' "I could not look upon her sorrowful eyes, or the pleading face of my gray-haired father, and trust myself again to the witchery of that voice and smile. A letter came to me; I dared not read it. (Alas! my heart pleaded too eloquently, even then, for his return.) I returned it unopened; my father and mother devoted themselves to lighten the load that lay upon my heart; but the perfume of a flower, a remembered strain of music, a struggling moonbeam, would bring back old memories, with a crushing bitterness that swept all before it for the moment. But my father's aged hand lingered on my head   "OVE AND DUTY.          113 with a blessing, and my mother's voice had the sweetness of an angel's, as it fell upon my ear! "Time passed on, and I had conquered myself. Your father saw me, and proposed for my hand; my parents left me free to choose, and Effie dear, are we not happy?" "Oh, mother," said Effie, (then looking sorrowfully in her face,) "did you never see Adolph again?" "Do you remember, my child, the summer evening we sat upon the piazza, when a dusty, travel-stained man came up the steps, and begged for 'a supper ' Do you recollect his bloated disfigured face? Effie, that was Adolph!" "Not that wreck of a man, mother?" said Effie, (covering her eyes with her hands, as if to shut him out from her sight.) "Yes; that was all that remained of that glorious intellect, and that form made after God's own image. I looked around upon my happy home, then upon your noble father- thh-- upon him, and," (taking Effie's little hand and pointing to the 'ing that encircled it,) " in your ear, my daughter, I now breathe my mother's prayer for me-' God help you to choose the right!'    " The bright head of Effie sank upon her mother's breast, and with a gush of tears she drew the golden circlet from her fin ger, and placed it in her mother's-hand. "God bless you, my child," said the happy mother, as she led her back to their quiet home. 8b  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7388-00000062"/> A FALSE PROVERB.

What if she might never walk the sunny earth, without a guiding hand? She places her basket upon the sidewalk, and wipes away a tear: now she explores her time-worn pocket; finds the hardly-earned coin, and placing it in the palm of the old man, presses his hand lovingly, and is gone! Poor Bartimeus! He may never see the honest face that bent so tenderly over him; but, to his heart's core, he felt that kindly pressure, and the sunshine is all the brighter, and the breeze- sweeter and fresher for that friendly grasp, and life is again bright to the poor blind man.

Tenderly she moves it from one shoul- der to another. Now, she lays its little cheek to hers; now, she kisses the little slender fingers; but still the baby moans. The boat touches the pier. All are leaving, but the mother and child; the ferryman tells her to " go too." She says timidly, "I want to return again-I live the other side-I came on board for the baby," (pointing to the dying child.)

RALPH RENOUX lived by his wits: i. e., he kept a boarding-house; taking in any number of ladies and gentle- men, who, in the philanthropic language of his advertisement, "pined for the comforts and elegancies of a home." Mr. Renoux's house was at the court-end of the city; his drawing-room was unexceptionably furnished, and himself, when "made up," after ten o'clock in the morning, quite comme il faut. Mrs. Renoux never appeared; being, in the pathetic words of Mr. Renoux, "in a drooping, invalid state:" never- theless, she might be seen, by the initiated, haunting the back stairs and entries, and with flying cap-strings, superintending kitchen-cabinet affairs. Mrs. Renoux was the unhappy mother of three unmarried daughters, with red hair, and tempers to match; who languished over Byron, in elegant negligees, of a morning, till after the last masculine had departed; then, in curl-papers and calico long-shorts, performed, for the absentees, the duty of chamber- maids; peeping into valises, trunks, bureaus, cigar boxes and coat pockets, and replenishing their perfumed bottles, from the  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7388-00000068"/> 126   BOARDING   HOUSE EXPERIENCE. gentlemen's toilet stands, with the most perfect nonchalance. At dinner, they emerged from their chrysalis state, into the most butterfly gorgeousness, and exchanged the cracked treble, with which they had been ordering round the over-tasked maid-of-all-work, as they affectionately addressed "Papa." At the commencement of my story, Renoux was as happy as a kitten with its first mouse--having entrapped, with the bait of his alluring advertisement, a widow lady with one child. "The comforts and elegancies of a home;"--it was just what the lady was seeking: -- how very fortunate! "Certainly, Madam," said Renoux, doubling himself into the form of the letter C. "I will serve your meals in your own room, if you prefer; but, really, Madam, I trust you will sometimes grace the drawing-room with your presence, as we have a very select little family of boarders. Do you choose to breakfast at eight, nine, or ten, Madam? Do you incline to Mocha? or prefer the leaves of the Celestial city . Are you fond of eggs, Madam . Would you prefer to dine at four, or five? IDo you wish six courses, or more? There is the bell- rope, Madam. I trust you will use it unsparingly, should any thing be omitted or neglected. I am just on my way down town, and if you will favor me by saying what you would fancy for your dinner to-day, (the market is full of every thing - fish, flesh, fowl and game of all sorts,) you have only to express a wish, Madam, and the thing is here; I should be mis- erable, indeed, were the request of a lady to be disregarded in   BOARDING   HOUSE EXPERIENCE.      127 my house, and that lady deprived of her natural protector. Which is it, Madam, fish? fleshi or fowl Any letters to send to the post-office, Madam? Any commands any where? I shall be too happy to be of service ";-- and bending to the tips of his patent leather toes, Mr. Renoux, facing the lady, bowed obsequiously and Terpsichore-ally out of the apartment. The dinner hour came. An Irish servant-girl came with it; and drawing out a table at an Irish angle upon the floor, tossed over it a tumbled tablecloth; placed upon it a castor, minus one leg, some cracked salt-cellars and tumblers; then laid some knives, left-handed, about the table; then, withdrew, to reap- pear with the result of Mr. Renoux's laborious research " in the market filled with every thing," viz: a consumptive looking mackerel, whose skin clung tenaciously to its back bone, and a Peter Schemel looking chicken, which, in its lifetime, must have had a vivid recollection of Noah and the forty days' shower. This was followed by a dessert of stale baker's tarts, compounded of lard and dried apples; and twenty-four purple , grapes. The next morning, Mr. Renoux tip-toed in, smirking and bowing, as if the bill of fare had been the most sumptuous in the world, and expressed the greatest astonishment and indig- nation, that " the stupid servant had neglected bringing up the other'courses which he had provided ;" then he inquired "how the lady had rested ;" and when she preferred a request for another pillow, (there being only six feathers in the one she  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7388-00000069"/> 128   BOARDING   HOUSE EXPERIENCE, had,) he assured her that it should be in her apartment in less than one hour. A fortnight after, he expressed the most intense disgust, that " the rascally upholsterer" had not yet sent what he had never ordered. Each morning, Mr. Renoux presented himself, at a certain hour, behind a very stiff dickey, and offered the lady the morning papers. Seating himself on the sofa, he would remark that - it was a very fine day, and that affairs in France appeared to be in statu quo; or, that the Czar had ordered his generals to occupy the principalities; that Gorchakoff was preparing to cross the Danube; that the Sul- tan had dispatched Omar Pasha to the frontiers; that the latter gentleman had presented his card to Gorchakoff, on the point of a yataghan, which courtesy would probably lead to  something else! During one of these agreeable calls, the lady took occasion slightly to object to Betty's nibbling the tarts, as she brought them up for dinner; whereupon, Mr. Renoux declared, upon the honor of a Frenchman, that " she should be pitched out of the door immediately, if not sooner; and an efficient servant engaged to take her place." The next day, the " efficient servant " came in, broom in hand, whistling "Oh, Susannna," and passing into the little dressing- room, to "put it to rights," amused herself by trying on the widow's best bonnet, and polishing her teeth and combing her hair with that lady's immaculate and individual head-brush and tooth-brush.

Madame Finfillan was a California widow; petite, plump and pretty--who bore her cruel bereavement with feminine philosophy, and slid round the world's rough angles with a most eel-like dexterity. In short, she was a Renoux in petticoats. Madame welcomed the widow with great pleasure, because, as she said, she "wished to fill her house only with first-class boarders;" and the widow might be assured that she had the apartments fresh from the diplomatic hands of the Spanish Consul, who would on no account have given them up, had not his failing health demanded a trip to the Continent. Madame also assured the widow, that, (although she said it herself,) every part of her house would bear the closest inspection; that those vulgar horrors, cooking butter, and diluted tea, were never seen on her Epicurean table; that they breakfasted at ten, lunched at two, dined at six, and enjoyed themselves in the interim; that her daughter, Miss Clara, was perfectly well qualified to superintend, when business called her mother away. And that nobody knew, (wringing her little white hands,) how much business she had to do, what with trotting round to those odious markets, trading for wood and coal, and such like unin- teresting things; or what would become of her, had she not some of the best friends in the world to look after her, in the absence of Mons.

Madame then caught up the widow's little boy, and, half smothering him with kisses, declared that there was nothing on earth she loved so well as children; that there were half a dozen of them in the house, who loved her better than their own fathers and mothers, and that their devotion to her was at times quite touching - (and here she drew out an embroidered pocket -handkerchief, and indulged in an interesting little sniffle be- hind its cambric folds.) Recovering herself, she went on to say, that the manner in which some boarding-house keepers treated children, was perfectly inhuman: that she had a second table for them, to be sure, but it was loaded with delicacies, and that she always put them up a little school lunch herself; on which occasion there was always an amicable little quarrel among them, as to which should receive from her the greatest number of kisses; also, that it was her frequent practice to get up little parties and tableaux, for their amusement. "But here is my daughter, Miss Clara," said she, introducing a fair-haired young damsel, buttoned up in a black velvet jacket, over a flounced skirt. "Just sixteen yesterday," said Madame: "naughty little blossom, budding out so fast, and pushing her poor mamma off the stage;" (and here Madame paused for a compliment, and looking in the opposite mirror, smoothed her jetty ringlets complacently.) "Yes, every morning little blossom's mamma looks in the glass, expecting to find a horror of a gray hair. But what makes my little pet so pensive to-day? -thinking of her little lover, hey? Has the naughty little thing a thought she does not share with mamma? But, dear me!"--and   BOARDING HOUSE EXPZRIENCE.

Well, the boarders were all "trusteed" by Maldame's butcher, baker and milkman; Miss Clara eloped with the widow's diamond ring and Mons. Peneke; and Madame, who had heard that Mons. Finfillan was "among the things that were," was just about running off with Mons.

"You, young, loving creature, who dream of your lover by night and by day- you fancy that he does the same of you? One hour, perhaps, your presence has captivated him, subdued him even to weakness; the next, he will be in the world, working his way as a man among men, forgetting, for the time being, your very ex- istence. Possibly, if you saw him, his outer self, so hard and stern, so different from the self you know, would strike you with pain. Or else his inner aud diviner self, higher than you dream of, would turn coldly from yoU insigvficant love." INSIGNIFICANT love!!"  I like that.  More especially when out of ten couple you meet, nine o!-the wives are as far above their husbands, in point of mind, as the stars are above the earth.   For the credit of the men I should be sorry to say how many of them would be minus coats, hats, pantaloons, cigars, &amp;c., were it not for their wives' earnings; or how  many smart speeches and able sermons have been concocted by their better halves, (while rocking the cradle,) to be delivered to the public at the proper time, parrot fashion, by the lords of creation. Wisdom will die with the men, there 's no gainsaying that! Catch a smart, talented, energetic woman, and it will puzzle you to find a  man  that will compare with her for go- aheadativeness.

Who cheers you up, when her nerves are all in a double-and-twisted knot and you come home with your face long as the moral law?.

C0oBEr says that for two years after his, marriage, he retained his disposition to flilrt with pretty women; but at last his wife--probably having lost all hope of his reforming himsolf--gently tapped him upon the arm, and remarked- "Don't do that. I do not like it." Cobbett says:-- , That rwas quite enough. I had never thought on the subject be- fore; one hair of her head was more dear to me than all other women in the world; and this I knew that she knew; but now I saw that this was not alti that she had a right to from me.

It is not in any masculine to get on his knees that way, with- out a motive!

If he'd said about a quarter part of that, you might have believed him. His affection for Mrs. Cobbett was skin-deep.

Yes, I tried it once, with city habits and a city wife: got rabid with the dog days, and nothing could cure me but a nib- ble of green grass. There was Susan, you know, who never was off a brick pavement in her life, and did n't know the dif- ference between a cheese and a grindstone. Well, we ripped up our carpets, and tore down our curtains, and packed up our crockery, and nailed down our pictures, and eat dust for a week, and then we emigrated to Daisy Ville. Could I throw up a window or fasten back a blind in that house, without sacrificing my suspenders and waisthand but- ton? No, sir! Were not the walls full of Red Rovers?

Instead of the comfortable naps to which I had been accustomed, I had to sleep with one eye open all night, lest I should n't get into the city in time. I had tobe shaving in the morning before a rooster in the barn-yard had stirred a feather; swallowed my coffee and toast by steam, and then, still masticating, made for the front door. There stood Peter with my horse and gig,--for I detest your cars and om. nibuses. On the floorof the chaise was a huge basket in which to bring home material for the next day's dinner; on the seat was a dress of my wife's to be left "without fail" at Miss Sewing Silk's, to have the forty-seventh hook moved onesixth of a de gree higher up on the back. Then there was a package of shawls from Tom Fools &amp; Co., to be returned, and a pair of shoes to carry to Lapstone, who was to select another pair for me to bring out at night; and a demijohn to be filled with Sherry. Well, I whipped up Bucephalus, left my sleeping wife and babies, and started for town; cogitating over an intri cate business snarl, which bade defiance to any straightening process. I had n't gone half a mile before'an old maid (I hate old maids) stopped me to know if I was going into town, and if I was, if I would n't take her in, as the omnibusse made her sick. She said she was niece to Squire Dandelion, and "had a few chores to do a shopping." So I took her in, or rather she took me in, (but she did n't do it but once--for I bought a sulkey next day!)

So I went round on an empty stomach, hunting up my expressman parcels, and wending my way to   K the stable with arms and pockets running over. When I got home, found my wife in despair, no tacks in the house to nail down carpets, and not one to be had at the store in the village; the cook had deserted because she could n't do without (" her ! city privileges," (meaning Jonathan Jones, the "dry dirt"    man); and the chambermaid, a buxom country girl with fire-  red hair, was spinning round the crockery (a la Blitz) be-  cause she " could n't eat with the family." Then Charley was taken with the croup in the night, and in my fright I put my feet into my coat sleeves, and my arms in- to my pants, and put on one of my wife's ruffles instead of a dicky, and rode three miles in a pelting rain, for some "goose grease" for his throat. Then we never found out till cherries, and strawherries, and- peaches were ripe, how many friends (?) we had. There was a horse hitched at every rail in the fence, so long as there was anything left to eat on a tree in the farm; but if my wife went in town shopping, and called on any of them, they were " out, or engaged;" - or if at home, had "just done dinner, and were going to ride." Then there was no school in the neighborhood for the chil- dren, and they were out in the barn-yard feeding the pigs with lump sugar, and chasing the hens off the nest to see what was the prospect for eggs, and making little boats of their shoes, and sailing them in the pond, and milking the cow in the mid- dle of the day, &amp;.

A VERY pretty girl was Lucy Lee.  Don't ask me to de- scribe her; stars, and gems, and flowers, have long since been exhausted in depicting heroines. Suffice it to say, Lucy was as pretty a little fairy as ever stepped foot in a slipper or twisted a ringlet. Of course, Lucy knew she was pretty; else why did the gentlemen stare at her so? Why did Harry Graham send her so many bouquets? Why did Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones try to sit each other out in an evening call? Why were picnics and fairs postponed, if she were engaged or ill? Why did so many young men request an introduction? Why did all the serenaders come beneath her window? Why was a pew or omnibus never full when she appeared at the door? And last, though not least, why did all the women imitate and hate her so? We will do Miss Lucy the justice to say, that she bore her blushing honors very meekly. She never flaunted her con- quest in the faces of less attractive feminines ;' no, Lucy was the farthest remove from a coquette; but kind words and bright smiles were as natural to her as fragrance to flowers, or music to birds. She never ried to win hearts, and between you and me, I think that's the way she did it. lb   THE FATAL MARRIAGE.          153 Grave discussions were often held about Lucy's future hus. band; the old maids scornfully asserting that " beauties gener. ally pick up a crooked stick at last," while the younger ones cared very little whom she married, if she only were married and out of their way. Meanwhile, Lucy smiled at her own happy thoughts, and sat at her little window on pleasant, summer evenings, watching for Harry, (poor Harry,) who, when he came, was at a loss to know if he had ever given her little heart one flutter, so merrily did she laugh, and chat with him. Skillful little Lucy, it was very right you shouldn't -let him peep into your heart till he had opened a window in his own. Lucy's papa didn't approve of late hours or lovers; moon- light he considered but another name for rheumatism; at nine o'clock, precisely, he rung the bell each evening for family prayers; and when the Bible came in lovers were expected to go out: in case they were obtuse, --chairs set back against the wall, or an extra lamp blown out, or the fire taken apart, were hints sufficiently broad to be understood; and they generally answered the purpose. Miss Lucy's little lamp, glowing im- nediately after from her bed-room window, gave the jnale ;o the "Mede land  Persian" order of Mr. Lee's family Irrangements. Still, Lee house was not a hermitage, by any means. More Yhite cravats and black coats passed over "Deacon"Lee's ilreshold, than ilto any hotel in Yankeedom. Little Lucy's a9ther, too, was a modern Samaritan, never weary of experi- Lenting on their dyspeptic and bronchial affections; while Lucy erself (bless her kind heart) knew full well that two-thirds of  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7388-00000083"/> 154      THE FATAL MARRIAGE. them had large families, enlpty purses, and more Judases and Paul Prys than "Aarons and Hurs" in their congregations. Among the habituts of Lee house, none were so acceptable to Lucy's father, as Mr. Ezekiel Clark, a bachelor of fifty, an ex- minister, and now an agent for some "Benevolent Society." Ezekiel had an immensely solemn face; and behind this con- venient mask he was enabled to carry out, undetected, various little plans, ostensibly for the "society's" benefit, but privately -for his own personal aggrandizement. When Ezekiel's opin- ion was asked, he crossed his hands and feet, and fastened his eyes upon the wall, in an attitude of the deepest abstraction, while his questioner stood on one leg, awaiting, with the most intense anxiety, the decision of such an oracular Solomon. Well, not to weary you, the long and short of it was, that Solomon was a stupid fool, who spent his time trying to humbug the religious public in general, and Deacon Lee in par- ticular, into the belief that had he been consulted before this world was made, he could have suggested great and manifold improvements. As to Deacon Lee, no cat ever tossed a poor mouse more dexterously than he played with the deacon's free will; all the while very demurely pocketing the spoils in the shnpe of "donations" to the " society," with which he appeased his washerwoman and tailor, and transported himself across the country, on trips to Newport, Saratoga, &amp;c., &amp;c. His favorite plan was yet to be carried out; which was no more or less than a modest request for the deacon's pretty daughter, Lucy, in marriage. Mr. Lee rubbed his chin, and said, "Lucy was nothing but a foolish little girl;" but Ezekiel   THE FATAL MARRIAGE     .      155 overruled it, by remarking that that was so much the more reason sh3 should have a husband some years-her senior, with some knowledge of the world, qualified to check and advise her; to all of which, after an extra pinch of snuff, and another look into Ezekiel's oracular face, Deacon Lee assented. Poor little Lucy! Ezekiel knew very well that her father's word was law, and when Mr. Lee announced him as her future husband, she knew she was just as much Mrs. Ezekiel Clark, as if the bridal ring had been already slipped on her fairy finger. She sighed heavily, to be sure, and patted her little foot ner- vously, and when she handed him his tea, thought he looked older than ever; while Ezekiel swallowed one cup after an- other, till his eyes snapped and glowed like a panther's in am- bush. That night poor Lucy pressed her lips to a faded rose, the gift of Harry Graham; then, cried herself to sleep! Unbounded was the indignation of Lucy's admirers, when the sanctimonious Ezekiel was announced as the expectant bridegroom. Harry Graham took the first steamer for Eu- rope, railing at -"woman's fickleness."  (Consistent. Harry! when never a word of love had passed his moustached lip.) Shall I tell you how Ezekiel was transformed into the most ridiculous of lovers? how his self-conceit translated Lucy's in- difference into maiden coyness? how he looked often in the glass and thought he was not so very old after all? how he ad- vised Lucy to tuck away all her bright curls, because they " look- ed so childish l" how he named to her papa an "early mar- riage day," - not that he felt nervous about losing his prize-  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7388-00000084"/> 156      THE FATAL MARRIAGE. oh, no (?)-but because "the society's business required his undivided attention." Well; Lucy, in obedience to her father's orders, stood up in her snow-white robe, and vowed "to love and cherish" a man just her father's age, with whom she had not the slightest congeniality of taste or feeling. But papa had said it was an excellent match, and Lucy never gainsayed papa; still, her long lashes drooped heavily over her blue eyes, and her hand trembled, and her cheek grew deathly pale, as Ezekiel handed her to the carriage that whirled them rapidly away. Shall I tell you how long months and years dragged wearily on? how Lucy saw through her husband's mask of hypocrisy and self-conceit? how to indifference succeeded disgust? how Harry Graham returned from Europe, with a fair young Eng- lish bride? how Lucy grew nervous and hysterical? how Eze- kiel soon wearied of his sick wife, and left her in one of those tombs for the wretched, an insane hospital? and how she wasted, day by day-then died, with only a hired nurse to close those weary blue eyes? In a quiet corner of the old churchyard where Lucy sleeps, a silver-haired old man, each night at dew-fall, paces to and fro, with remorseless tread, as if by that weary vigil he would fain atone to the unconscious sleeper, for turning her sweet young life to bitterness.

The stranger from a distance, who had worshiped her genius, might in vain make a pilgrim- age to do her honor. I, who had personally known and loved her, had not even the poor consolation of decking the bosom of her grave with the flowers I had gathered; I could not kiss the turf beneath which she is reposing; I could not drop a tear on the sod, 'neath which her remains are mouldering back to their native dust. I could not tell, (though I so longed to know,) in which of the little graves --for there were several- slept her "dear May," her "pure Ellen;" the little, timid, household doves, who folded their weary wings when the parent bird was stricken down, by the aim of the unerring Archer. Though allied by no tie of blood to the gifted creature, who, somewhere, lay sleeping there, I felt the flush of shame mount to my temples, to turn away and leave her dust so unhonored.

How will the world's wild discord reach thy heart4 To startle and appal I Thy generous scorn Of all things base and mean --thy quick, keen taste, Dainty and delicate - thy instinctive fear Of those unworthy of a soul so pure, Thy rare, unchildlike dignity of mien,             - Al - they will all bring pain to thee, my child And oh I if ever their grace and goodness meet Cold looks and careless greetings, how will all The latent evil yet undisciplined In their young, timid souls forgiveness find? Forgiveness and forbearance, and soft chidings, Which I, their mother, learn'd of love, to give. Ah I let me stay I albeit my heart is weary, Weary and worn, tired of its own sad beat,            e That finds no echo in this busy world Which cannot pause to answer - tired, alike, Of joy and sorrow - of the day and night 1 Ah I take them FIRST, my Father! and then me; And for their sakes -for their sweet sakes, my Father I Let me find rest beside them, at thy feet. !: l,   BEST THNGS.  I HAVE a horror of "best" things, come they in the shape of shoes, garments, bonnets or rooms. In such a harness my soul peers restlessly out, asking 'ifIbe." I'm puzzled to find myself. I become stiff and formal and artificial as my sur- roundings. But of all the best things, spare me the infiction of a "best room." Out upon a carpet too fine to tread upon, books too dainty to handle, sofas that but mock your weary limbs, and curtains that dare not face a ray of sunlight! Had I a house, there should be no " best room" in it. No upholsterer should exorcise comfort, or children, from my door- sill. The free, fresh air should be welcome to play through it; the bright, glad sunshine to lighten and warm it; while fresh mantel-flowers should woo us visits from   humming-bird and drowsy bee. For pictures, I'd look from   out my  windows, upon a  land- scape painted by the Great Master-ever fresh, ever varied, and never marred by envious "cross lights;" now, wreathed in morning's silvery mist; now, basking in noon's broad beam; now, flushed with sunset's golden glow; now, sleeping in dreamy moonlight. 11b  &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7388-00000087"/> 162        BEST THNGS. For statuary, fill my house with children--rosy, dimpled, laughing children; now, tossing their sunny ringlets from open brows; now, vailing their merry eyes in slumberous dreams, 'neath snow-white lids; now, sweetly grave, on bended knee, with clasped hands, and lisped -words of holy prayer. Did I say I'd have nothing "best?" Pardon me. Sunday should be the best day of all the seven--not ushered in with ascetic form, or lengthened face, or stiff and rigid manners. Sweetly upon the still Sabbath air should float the matin hymn of happy childhood; blending with early song of birds, and wafted upward, with flowers' incense, to Him whose very name is LovE. It should be no day for puzzling the half-developed brain of childhood with gloomy creeds, to shake the simple faith that prompts the innocent lips to say, "Our Father." It should be no day to sit upright on stiff-backed chairs, till the golden sun should set. No; the birds should not be more welcome to warble, the flowers to drink in the air and sunlight, or the trees to toss their lithe limbs, free and fetterless. "I'm so sorry that tomorrow is Sunday!" From whence does this sad lament issue? From under your roof, oh mista- ken but well-meaning Christian parents - from the lips of your child, whom you compel to listen to two or three unintelligible sermons, sandwiched between Sunday schools, and finished off at nightfall by tedious repetitions of creeds and catechisms, till sleep releases your weary victim! No wonder your child shudders, when the minister tells him that "Heaven is one eternal Sabbath." ie   BEST THNGS.          163 Oh, mistaken parent! relax the over-straned bow the fearfulrebound, and make the Sabbath what God desmed it, not a weariness, but the "best" and happiest day of all the seven.  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7388-00000088"/> THE VESTRY MEETING. TBE clock had just struck seven. The sharp-nosed old sexton of the Steeple-Street Church had arranged the lights to his mind, determined the proper latitude and longitude of Bibles and hymn-books, peeped curiously into the little black stove in the corner, and was now admonishing every person who passed in, of the propriety of depositing the " free soil" on his boots upon the entry door-mat. In they crept, one after another - pale-faced seamstresses, glad of a reprieve; servant girls, who had turned their backs upon unwashed dishes; mothers, whose " crying babies" were astounding the neighbors; old maids, who had nowhere to spend their long evenings; widowers, who felt an especial solici- tude lest any of the sisters should be left to return home unpro- tected; girls and boys, who came because they were bid, and who had no very clear idea of the performances; and last, though not least, Ma'am Spy, who thought it her duty to see that none of the church-members were missing, and to inquire every Tuesday night, of her friend Miss Prim, if she did n't consider Mrs. Violet a proper subject for church discipline, be- cause she always had money enough to pay her board bills, although her husband had deserted her. Then there were'the four Misses Nipper, who crawled in as if   TIE  VESTRY MEETING.         165 the vestry floor were paved with live kittens, and who had never been known, for four years, to vary one minute in their attend- ance, or to keep awake from the first prayer to the doxology. Then, there was Mrs. John Emmons, who sang the loudest, and prayed the longest, and wore the most expensive bonnets, of any female member in the church-whose name was on every committee, who instituted the select praying circle for the more aristocratic portion of the parish, and whose pertina- cious determination to sit next to her husband at the Tuesday night meeting, was regarded by the uninitiated as a beautiful proof of conjugal devotion; but which, after patient investiga- tion, (between you and me, dear reader,) was found to be for the purpose of arresting his coat-flaps when he popped up to make mental shipwreck of himself by making a speech. Then, there was Mr. Nobbs, whose remarks were a re-hash of the different religious periodicals of the day, diversified with misapplied texts of Scripture, and delivered with an intonation and gesticulation that would have given Demosthenes fits. Then, there was Zebedee Falstaff, who accomplished more for the amelioration of the human race (according to his own account) than any man of his aldermanic proportions in the nation, and who delivered (on a hearty supper) a sleepy ex- hortation on the duties of self-denial and charity, much to the edification of one of his needy relatives, to -whose tearful story he had that very day turned a deaf ear. Then, there was Brother Higgins, who was always 'just go. ing" to make a speech, " if brother Thomas had n't so exactly anticipated his sentiments a minute before."  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7388-00000089"/> 166      THE VESTRY MEETING. Then, there was Mr. Addison Theophilus Shakspeare Milton, full of poetical and religious inspiration, who soared so high in the realms of fancy, that his hearers lost sight of him. Then, there was little Dr. Pillbox, who gave us every proof in his weekly exhortations of his knowledge of " drugs," not to mention young Smith, who chased an idea round till he lost it, and then took shelter behind a bronchial difficulty which : compelled him, " unwillingly (?) to come to a close." Then, there were some sincere, good-hearted Christians- respectable citizens - worthy heads of families; but whose lips had never been " touched with a live coal from off the altar." Where was the pastor? Oh, he was there-a slight, fragile; scholar-like looking man, with a fine intellectual face, exquisitely refined tastes and sensibilities, and the meek spirit of " the Master." Had those slender shoulders no cross to bear? When chance sent some fastidious worldling through that vestry door, did it cost him nothing to watch the smile of contempt curl the stranger's lip, as some uneducated, but well-meaning layman, presented with stammering tongue, in ungrammatical phrase, distorted, one-sided, bigoted views of great truths which his eloquent tongue might have made as clear as the noon-day, and as cheering and welcome as heaven's own blessed light, to the yearning, dissatisfied spirit? Oh, is there nothing in religion, when it can so subdue the pride of intellect as to enable its professor to disregard the stammering tongue, and sit meekly at the feet of the ignorant disciple be- cause he is a disciple?

I won't allude to the legitimate use of a pocket-handkerchief; I won't speak of the sad hearts that "' forty dollars," in the hands of some philanthropist, might lighten; I won't speak of the "crows' feet " that will be penciled on your fair face, when your laundress carelessly sticks the point of her remorseless smooth- ing iron through the flimsy fabric, or the constant espionage you must keep over your treasure, in omnibuses, or when prome- nading; but I will ask you how many of the lords of creation, for whose especial benefit you array yourself, will know whether that cobweb rag fluttering in your hand cost forty dollars, or forty cents? Pout if you like, and toss your head, and say that you  " don't dress to please the gentlemen." I don't hesitate to tell you (at this distance from your finger nails) that is a downright mistake! and that the enormous sums most women expend for articles, the cost of which few, save shop-keepers and butterfly feminines, know, is both astounding and ridiculous.

Not a bit of it! Yonder is a group of gentlemen. You pass them in your promenade; they glance carelessly at your tout-ensemble, but their eyes rest admiringly on a figure close behind you. It will chagrin you to learn that this locomotive loadstone has on a seventy-five cent hat, of simple straw--a dress of lawn, one shilling per yard - a twenty-five cent collar, and a shawl of the most un- pretending price and fabric. All these items you take in at a glance, as you turn upon her your aristocratic eye of feminine criticism to extract, if possible, the talismanic secret of her magnetism. What is it? Let me tell you. Nature, willful dame, has an aristocracy of her own, and in one of her independent freaks has so daintily fashioned your rival's limbs, that the meanest garb could not mar a grace, nor the costhest fabric add one. Compassionating her slender purse, nature has also added an artistic eye, which accepts or rejects fabrics and colors with unerring taste; hence her apparel is always well chosen and harmonious, producing the effect of a rich toilet at the cost of " a mere song;" and as she sweeps ma- jestically past, one understands why Dr. Johnson pronounced a woman to be "perfectly dressed when one could never re- member what she wore."   A BROADWAY SHOP REVERIE.         169 Now, I grant you, it is very provoking to be eclipsed by a star without a name--moving out of the sphere of "upper- ten"-dom -a woman who never wore a " camel's hair shawl," or owned a diamond in her life; after the expense you have incurred, too, and the fees you have paid to Madame Pompa. dour and Stewart for the first choice of their Parisian fooleries. It is harrowing to the sensibilities. I appreciate the awkward- ness Ce your position; still, my compassion jogs my invention vainly for a remedy--unless, indeed, you consent to crush such democratic presumption, by labelling the astounding price of the dry-goods upon your aristocratic back.  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7388-00000091"/> "THE OLD WOM.'.N."

Mortal lips have said, "The boy must die!" A mother's hope never dies. She clasps him closer to her breast, and gazes upward; - food and sleep and rest are for- gotten, so that that little flickering taper die not out. Gently upon her soft, warm breast she wooes for it baby slumbers; long, weary nights, up and down the cottage floor she paces, soothing its restless moaning. Suns rise and set - stars pale - seasons come and go; - she heeds them not, so that those lan- guid eyes but beam brightness. Down the meadow- by the brook - on the hill-side - she seeks with him the health-restor- ing breeze. God be praised! - health comes at last! What joy to see the rosy flush mantle on the pallid cheek! - what joy to see the shrunken limbs grow round with health! - what joy to see the damp, thin locks grow crisp and glossy!

What matter that her slender purse be empty, so that his childish heart may never know denial  Years roll on. That loving mother's eye grows dim; her glossy locks are silvered; her limbs are sharp and shrunken; her footsteps slow and tottering. And the boy?- the cherished Joseph? - he of the bold, bright eye, and sinewy limb, and bounding step? Surely, from his kind hand shall flowers be strewn on the dim, downward path to the dark valley; surely will her son's strong arm be hers to lean on; his voice of mu- sic sweeter to her dull ear than seraphs' singing. No, no! --the hum of busy life has struck upon his ear, drowning the voice of love.

Well, here come the cars. Band-boxes, trunks, baskets, and bundles are counted, and checks taken; a grave discussion is solemnly held, as to which side of the cars the sun shines on; seats are chosen with due deliberation, and the locomotive does its own "puffing" to the bystanders, and darts off. It is noon! How intense the heat; how annoying the dust; how crowded the cars; how incessant the cries of that poor tired baby! The ladies' bonnets are getting awry, their fore- heads flushed, and their smooth tresses unbecomingly frowsed, (see Fern Dictionary.)

I say it is to take up those papers, one by one, and laugh over the funny things and skip, the stupid ones,-to admire the ingenuity of would-be literary lights, who pilfer one half their original (?) ideas, and steal the remainder. I say it is to shud- der a thanksgiving that you are not in the marriage list, and to try, for the hundredth time, to solve the riddle: how can each paper that passes through your hands be " the best and cheap- est periodical in the known world 1" I say it is to look round an editorial sanctum, inwardly chuckling at the forlorn appearance it makes without feminine fingers to keep it tidy: to see the looking-glass veiled with cobwebs; the dust on the desk thick enough to write your name in; the wash-bowl and towel mulatto color; the soap liquified to a jelly, (editors like soft soap!); the table covered with a heterogeneous mass of manuscripts, and paper folders, and wafers, and stamps, and blotting-paper, and envelopes, and tailors' bills, and letters complimentary, belligerent and pacific. I say it is to hear the editor complain, with a. frown, of the heat and his headache; to conceal a smile, while you suggest the probability of relief if a window should be opened; to see him start at your superior profundity; to hear him say, with a groan, how much " proof " he has to read, before he caa leava  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7388-00000096"/> 180       NEWSPAPER-DOM, for home; to take off your gloves and help him correct it;- to hear him say, there is a book for review, which he has not time to look over; to take a folder and cut the leaves, and affix guide-boards for notice at all the fine passages; to see him kick over an innocent chair, because he cannot get hold of the right word for an editorial; to feel (while you help him to it) very much like the mouse who gnawed the lion out of the net, and - then to take up his paper some days after, and find a paragraph endorsed by him, "deploring the intellectual inferiority of women."

PATTER, patter, patter! down comes the city shower, on dusty and heated pavements; gleefully the willow trees shake out their long green tresses, and make their toilettes in the little mirror pools beneath. The little child runs out, with outspread palm, to catch the cool and pearly drops. The weary laborer, drawing a long, gratefql breath, bares the flushed brow of toil; boyhood, with bare and adventurous jot, wades through gut- ter rivers, forgetful of birch, and bread and butter. Ladies skutter tiptoe, with uplifted skirts, to the shelter of some friendly omnibus; gentlemen, in the independent consciousness of cor- duroys, take their time and umbrellas, while the poor jaded horses shake their sleek sides, but do not say neigh to their impromptu shower-bath. The little sparrows twitter their thanks from the dripping eaves, circling the piazza, then laving their speckled breasts at the little lakelets in the spout. Old Towser lies with his nose to the door-mat, siffing " the cool," with the philosophy of Di- ogenes. Petrarch sits in the parlor with his Laura, too happy when some vivid lightning flash gives him an excuse foi closer quarters.

The old maid opposite sets out a single geranium, scraggy as herself, invoking some double blossoms. Forlorn experimenter! even a spinster's affections must centre somewhere. See that little pinafore mariner stealing out, with one eye on the nursery window, to navigate his pasteboard boat in the street pools. There's a flash of sunshine! What a glorious rainbow! The little fellow tosses his arms aloft, and gazes at it. Ten to one, the little Yankee, instead of admiring its gor- geous splendor, is wishing he could invert it for a swing, and seizing it at both ends, sweep through the stars with it. Well, it is nothing new for a child to like " the milky tay." Fair weather again! piles of heavy clouds are drifting by, leaving the clear blue ,sky as serene as when "the morning stars first sang together." Nature's gems sparkle lavishy on glossy leaf and swaying branch, on bursting bud and flower; while the bow of peace melts gently and imperceptibly away, like the dying saint into the light of Heaven. Oh, earth is gloriously fair! Alas! that the trail of the ser-. pent should be over it all!   MRS. WEASEL'S HUSBAND. "A woman, a dog, and a walnut tree, The more they are beaten the better thly he." "AmY man who believes that, had better step into my shoes," said little Mr. Weasel. "I suppose I'm what you call 'the head of the family,' but I should n't know it if somebody did n't tell me of it. Heigho! who'd have thought it five and twenty years ago? Did n't I stifle a tremendous strong penchant for Diana Dix, (never smoked, I remember, for four hours after it,) because I had my private suspicions she'd hold the reins in spite of my teeth, and so I offered myself to little Susey Snow, (mistake in her name, by the way.) You might have spanned her round the waist, or lifted her with one hand. She never looked anybody in the face when they spoke to her, and her vpice was as soft as --  my brains! I declare, it's unaccountable how deceitful female nature is! Never was so taken in in my life; she's a regular Vesuvius crater! Her will? (don't mention it!) Try to pry up the Alps with a cambric needle! If she'd only fly into a passion, I think I could venture to pluck Vip a little spirit; but that cool, determined, never-say-die look! would turn Cayenne pepper to oil.

I suppose it's time to feed that baby; Mrs. Weasel will be home pretty soon, from the 'Woman's Rights Conven- tion.' No, I won't, either; I 'l give it some paregoric, arid run up garret and smoke one cigar. I feel as though I could n't look a humming-bird in the eye! Nice cigar! - very nice!

The sun glares murkily down, through the smoky and stench- laden atmosphere, upon the dirty pavements; newsboys, with clamorous cries, are vending their wares; milkmen rattle over the pavements, and startle drowsy sleepers by their shrill whoopings; housemaids are polishing door knobs, washing sidewalks, and receiving suspicious looking baskets and parcels from contiguous groceries and bakeshops. The sun rolls on his course; purifying the air and benignly smiling upon all the dwellers in the city, as though he would gently win them from unholy purposes to heavenly meditations and pursuits. -And now the streets are filled with a motley show of silks, satins, velvets, feathers and jewels - while carriages and vehicles of every description roll past, freighted with counter- freed youths and their Dulcineas, bent upon a holiday. Hun- dreds of " drinking saloons " belch forth their pestiferous breath, upon which is borne, to the ear of the passer-by, (perhaps a lady or tender child,) the profane curse and obscene gibe; and from their portals reel intoxicated brutes, who once were men.

And stable-keepers, oyster and ice-cream ven- ders, liquor sellers, et id omne genus, are reaping a golden har- vest, upon which the "Lord of the Sabbath " shall, sooner or later, send "a blight and a mildew." 'Tis Sunday in the country. Serene and majestic, in the distance, lie the blue, cloud-capped hills; while, at their base, the silver stream winds gracefully, sparkling in the glad sunlight. Now the fragrant branches stir with feathered life; and one clear, thrilling carol lifts the finger from the dumb lip of Nature, heralding a full orchestra of untaught choristers, which plume their wings, and soaring, seem to say, Praise Him! praise Him! Obedient to the sweet summons, the silver-haired old man and rosy child, along grassy, winding paths, hie to the little village church. On the gentle maiden's kindly arm leans the bending form of "four score years and ten," gazing, with dimmed but gratefiil eye, on leafy stem, and bursting bud, and full-blown flower; or, listening to the wind dallying with the tall tree-tops, or kissing the fields of golden grain, which wave their graceful recognition, as it sweeps by on its fragrant path.   COUNTRY SUNDAY VS, CITY SUND'AY. 191 And now, slowly the Sabbath sun sinks beneath the western hills in gold and purple glory. Gently the dew of peace de- scends on closed eyes and flowers; while holy stars creep softly out, to keep their tireless watch o'er happy hearts and Sabbath-loving homes.  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7388-00000102"/> SOBER HUSBANDS. "F your husband looks grave, let him alone; don't disturb or annoy him." OH, pshaw! were I married, the soberer my husband look- ed, the more fun I'd rattle about his ears. Do n't disturb him! I guess so! I'd salt his coffee- and pepper his tea-- and sugar his beefsteak - and tread on his toes - and hide his newspaper- and sew up his pockets-and put pins in his slippers - and dip his cigars in water,- and I would n't stop for the great Mogul, till I had shortened his long face to my liking. Certainly, he 'd "get vexed;" there would n't be any fun in teasing him if he did n't; and that would give his mel- ancholy blood a good, healthful start; and his eyes would snap and sparkle, and he 'd say, "Fanny, WILL you be quiet or not . " and I should laugh, and pull his whiskers, and say decidedly, "Not!" and then I should tell him he had n't the slightest idea how handsome he looked when he was vexed, and then he would pretend not to hear the compliment - but would pull up his dickey, and take a sly peep in the glass (for all that!) and then he'd begin to grow amiable, and get off his stilts, and be just as agreeable all the rest of the evening as if he was n't my husband; and all because I did n't follow that stupid bit of advice " to let him alone."

SING away, little bird! only you, the trees, and myself, are stirring, but you have an appreciative audience. Your sweet carol and the graceful waving of yonder tree, as the soft wind turns up its silver-lined leaves in the sunlight, fill my heart with a quiet gladness. Whom have we here? with ragged skirt, bare mud-be- grimm'd feet and ankles, tattered shawl, and tangled masses of hair fluttering round a face ploughed deep with time and trouble. See - she stoops, and, stretching her skeleton fingers towards the gutter, grasps some refuse rags and paper, and thrusts them greedily into the dirty sack she bears upon her shoulders. Good heavens! that dirty mass of rags a woman? How wearily she leans against yonder tree, gazing upward into its branches! Perhaps thatelittle bird's matin song has swept some chord for long years untouched in that callous heart; telling her of the shelter of a happy home, where Plenty sat at the board and Love kept guard at the threshold. Oh! who can tell? One more song, my little bird, ere she goes; not so ,hockingly joyous, but sweet, and soft and low--a requiem for blighted youth and blasted hopes; for know that the blue sky to whose arch you soar, bends over misery enough to make the bright seraphs weep.   -            Illlthlr.,:i[:,  J '---z- ...xX %,2, X.- OUR- STET  &#xD;<pb n="-195" xml:id="VAC7388-00000104"/> *   OUR STREET.           195 Bless me! what yell is that?"Yeei --ho -oe --yeei-- ho." It is only a milkman, and that horrid cry simply means, "Milk for sale." What a picture of laziness is the vender! Jump off your cart, man, thump on the kitchen door with your milk-dipper, and rouse that sleepy cook who is keeping you waiting her pleasure; that's the way to do business: pshaw! your manliness must have been diluted with your milk. One by one they emerge, the dead-and-alivelooking housemaids, dragging their brooms after them lazily and helplessly, and bandy words with the vexed millkman, and gossip with each other, as they rest their chins on their broom-handles, on "kitchen' cabinet " affairs. Here comes an Italian, balancing a shelf-load of plaster Cu- pids and Venuses, and dove-circled vases. How mournfully his dark eyes look out from beneath his tasseled cap, as he lifts his burden from his head for a momentary reprieve. They tell of weary feet, a heavy heart, and a light purse.- They tell, with a silent reproach, that our hearts are as cold as our clime. Oh! not all, good Pietro! For your sake, I'll make myself mistress of that sleeping child; though, ruth to say, the sculp. tor who moulded it has most wofully libelled Nature. Would I could see the sunny skies 'upon which your dark eyes first opened, and all the glorious forms that beauty wears in your vine-clad home beyond the seas.

Their little feet should be crushing the strawherries, ripe and sweet, on some sunny hill-slope, where breath of new-mown hay and clover blosoms would give rvose to their cheeks and strength and grace to their cramped and half-developed limbs. Poor little creatures! they never saw a patch of blue sky bigger than their satchels, or a blade of grass that dared to grow without permission from the mayor, aldermen and com- mon council. Poor little skeletons! tricked out like the fash- ion-prints, and fed on diluted skim-milk and big dictionaries. I pity you. A hand-organ! ground by a modern Peter Schemmel, and accompanied by a woman whose periphery it would be vain to compute by inches, singing, "I'd be a butterfly." Ye gods and graces! if ye heed her prayer, grant that she alight not on my two-lips! Now she is warbling, "Home I sweet home,"' as if she was n't making it for me, this minute, a perfect place of torment! Avaunt'! thou libel upon feminity - creep into corduroys and apply for the office of town crier. A funeral! That is nothing uncommon in a densely popu- lated city; so, nobody turns to look, as it winds along, slowly, as will the sad future to that young husband- that father of an hour. Sad legacy to him, those piles of tiny robes, and dainty little garments, whose elaborate and delicate embroidery was purchased at such a fearful price. Nature will have her revenge for a reckless disregard of her laws: so, there she lies,   OUR STREET.           197 the young mother, with the long-looked-for babe upon her girlish breast. Sad comment upon a foolish vanity. What have we here?--A carriage at the door? Ah! I recollect; there was a wedding at that house last nighl--lights flashing, music swelling - white arms gleaming through tissue textures, and merry voices breaking in upon my slumbers late in the small hours. Ah yes- and this is the bride's leave-taking. How proud and important that young husband lodoks, as he stands on the steps, with the bride's traveling shawl upon his arm, giving his orders to the coachman! Now he casts an impatient glance back through the open door into the hall, half jealous of the tear sparkling in the young wife's eye, as the mother presses her tenderly to her breast, as the father lays the hand of blessing on her sunny head, and brothers and sisters, half glad, half sad, offer their lips for a good-bye kiss. Hurry her not away!   Not even the heart she has singled out from all the world to lean upon, can love so fondly, so truly, as those she leaves behind. Dark days may come, when love's sunshine shall be o'erclouded by cares and sickness, from which young manhood, impatient, shrinks.  Let her linger: so shall your faith in her young wifely love be strengthened by such strong filial yearning for these, her cradle watchers. Let her linger: silver hairs mingle in the mother's tresses; the father's dark eye grows dim with age, and insatiate Death heeds nor prayer, nor tear, nor lifted eye of supplication. Let her linger.

Know, then, O pestiferous Gotham, that half a score of these gentry, after having sounded it with a long pole to the bottom, for the benefit of my olfactories, have voted it a nuisance to which even a pig might make a gutter-al remonstrance. Oh! Marshal Tukey, if California yet holds you, in the name of the Asiatic cholera, and my "American constitution," recross the Isthmus and exorcise that barrel! Look on yonder door-step. See that poor, worn creature seated there, with a puling infant at her breast, from whence it draws no sustenance: on either side are two little creatures, apparently asleep, with their heads in her lap. Their faces are very pallid, and their little limbs have nothing of childhood's rounded symmetry and beauty. "Perhaps she is an impos- tor,' says Prudence, seizing my purse-strings, "getting up that tableau for just such impressible dupes as yourself." "Per- haps she is not," says Feeling; " perhaps, at this moment des- pair whispers in her tempted ear ' curse God and die!' Oh! then, how sad to have 'passed her by, on the other side!'" Let me be "duped," rather than that wan face should come between my soul and Heaven.   WHEN YOU ARE ANGRY. "When you are angry, take three breaths before you speak." I COULD N'T do it, said Mrs. Penlmmon. Long before that time I should be as placid as an oyster. "Three breaths! I could double Cape Horn in that time. I'm  telegraphic,--if I had to stop to reflect, I should never be saucy. I can't hold anger any more than an April sky can retain showers; the first thing I know, the sun is shining. You may laugh, but that's better than one of your foggy dispositions, drizzling drops of discomfort a month on a stretch; no computing whether you 'll have anything but gray clouds overhead the rest of your life. No: a good heavy dap of thunder for me -a lighting flash; then a bright blue sky and a clear atmosphere, and I am ready for the first flower that springs up in my path. "Three breaths!" how absurd! as if people, when they get excited,- ever have any breath, or if they have, are con- scious of it. I should like to see the Solomon who got off that sage maxim.  I should like better still to give him an op- portunity to test his own theory! It's very refreshing to see how good people can be, when they have no temptation to sin; how they can sit down and make a code of laws for the world in general and sinners in particular.  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7388-00000107"/> 200      WHEN YOU ARE ANGRY, I'Three breaths!"

Our forefathers and foremothers would have to hold the hair on their heads if they should wake up in 1854. They'd be as crazy as a cat in a shower-bath, at all our whimzing and rushing. Nice old snails! It's a question with me whether I should have crept on at their pace, had I been a cotemporary.

What stretching of limbs; what unfetter- ing of tongues and heels; what tossing-up of pinafores and primers; what visions of marbles, and hoops, and dolls, and apples, and candy, and gingerbread! How welcome the fresh air; how bright the sunshine; how tempting the grassy play- ground! Ah, there's a drop of rain - there's another; there's a thunder clap!"Just as school is out-how provoking!" echo a score of voices; and the pouting little prisoners huddle to- gether in the school-house porch, and console themselves by swapping jack-knives and humming tops, and telling marvellous stories of gypsies and giants; while Miss Prim, the dyspeptic teacher, shakes her head and the ferule, and declares that the former will "fly into fifty pieces;" upon which some of the boys steal out of doors and amuse themselves by sounding the puddles with their shoes, while others slyly whittle the desks, or draw caricatures on their slates, of Miss Prim's long nose.

And there 's a servant man for Master Simpkins, the fat dunce with the embroidered jacket, whose father owns " the big Hotel, and wishes his son to have a seat all by himself." And now they are all gone ;- all save little Bessie Bell, the new scholar,--a little four-year-older, who is doing penance over in the comer for " a misdemeanor." Bessie's mother is a widow. She has known such bright, sunny days, in the shelter of a happy home, with a dear armn to lean upon! Now, her sweet face is sad and care-worn, and when she speaks, her voice has a heart-quiver in it: but. some- how, when she talks to you, you do not notice that her dress is faded, or her bonnet shabby and rusty. You instinctively touch your hat to her, and treat her very courteously, as if she were a fine lady. As I said before, this is little Bessie's first day at school; for, she is light and warmth and sunshine to her broken-hearted mother. But, little Bessie must have bread to eat. A shop woman offered her mother a small pittance to come and help her a part of every day; but she is not to bring her child; so, Bessie must go to school, to be out of harm's way, and her mother tells Miss Prim, as she seats her on the hard bench, that "she is very timid and tender-hearted;" and then she kisses Bessi's little quivering lip, and leaves her with a heavy heart,   "TTLE  BESSIE.         203 Bessie dare not look up for a' few minutes; --it is all very odd and strange, and if she were not so frightened she would cry aloud. By-and-by she gains a little courage, and peeps out from beneath her drooping eye-lashes. Her little pinafore neighbor gives her a sweet smile-it makes her little heart so happy, that she throws her little dimpled arms about her neck and says, (out loud) "I love you!" Poor, affectionate little Bessie! she did n't know that that was a  "misdemeanor;" nor had she ever seen that bug-bear, a "School Committe." Miss Prim had; - and Miss Prim never wasted her lungs talking; so, she leisurely untied her black silk apron from her virgin waist, and proceeded to make an African of little Bessie, by pinning it tightly -over her face and head- an invention which herself and "the Committee" considered the nepl2us ultra of discipline. Bessie struggled, and said she "never would kiss anybody again--never--never;" but Miss Prim was inexorable, and, as her victim continued to utter smothered cries, Miss Prim told her "that she would keep her after the other children had gone home." One class after another recited; Bessie's sobs became less loud and frequent, and Miss Prim flattered herself, now that they had ceased altogether, that she was quite subdued, and con- gratulated herself complacently upon her extraordinary talent for " breaking in new beginners." And now, school being done, the children gone, her bonnet and India rubbers-being put on, and all her spinster " fixings" settled to her mind, visions of hot tea and buttered toast began  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7388-00000109"/> 204       LITTLE BESSIE. to float temptingly through her brain, and suggest the propriety of Bessie's release. "Bessie!"--no answer. "Bessie!"-no reply. Miss Prim laid the ferule across the little fat shoulders. Bessie didn't wince. Miss Prim unpinned the apron to confront the face that was bold enough to defy her and "the Committee." Little Bessie was dead! Well; there was a pauper funeral, and a report about that a child had been " frightened to death at school;" but Bessie's mother was a poor woman, consequently the righteous Commit- tee " did n't feel called upon to interfere with such idle reports."   THE DELIGHTS OF VISITING. WHAT is it to go away on a visit? Well, it is to take leave of the little velvet rocking-chair, which adjusts itself so nicely to your shoulders and spinal column; to cram,  squeeze, and otherwise compress your personal effects into an infinitessi- mal compass; to be shook, jolted, and tossed, by turns, in car- riage, railroad and steamboat; to be deafened with the stento- rian lungs of cab-drivers, draymen and porteis; to clutch your baggage as if every face you saw was a highwayman; (or to find yourself transported with rage, at finding it transported by steam to Greenland or Cape Horn.) It is to reach your friend's house, travel-stained, cold and weary, with an unbecoming crook in your bonnet; to be utterly unable to get the frost out of your tongue, or " the beam into your eye," and to have the felicity of hearing some strange guest remark to your'friend, as you say an early good-night, "Is it possible THAT is your friend, Miss Grey 1" It is to be ushered into the "best chamber," (always a north one) of a cold January night; to unhook your dress with stif- fened 'digits; to find every thing in your trunk but your night- cap; to creep between polished linen sheets, on a congealed mattress, and listen to the chattering of your own teeth until daylight.  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7388-00000110"/> 206   T IE DELIGHTS OQ     VISITING.

Hearts enough are laid at my feet, but I owe them all to the accidents of wealth and position. The world seems all emptiness to me. There must be something beyond this, else why this ceaseless reaching of the soul for some unseen good? Why do the silent voices of nature so thrill me?

She is very patient and sweet." "Yes, I know," said Helen; " but I have it in my power to make her so much more comfortable. It may preserve, at least lengthen her life." When little Mary opened her eyes the next morning, she half believed herself in fairy-land. Soft fleecy curtains were looped about her head, her little emaciated hand rested upon a silken coverlid, a gilded table stood by her bed-side, the little cup from which her lips were moistened was of bright silver, and a sweet face was bending over her, shaded by a cloud of golden hair, that fell like a glory about her head. "Where am I?" said the child, crossing her little hand across her bewildered brain. Helen smiled. "You are my little bird now, dear. How do you like your cage?" "It is very, very pretty," said Mary, with childish delight; "but won't you get tired of waiting upon a poor little sick girl? Mamma was used to it. You don't look as if you could work." "Don't I?" said Helen, with a slight blush; "for all that, you'll see how nicely I can take care of you, little one. I'll sing to you; I 'll read to you; I 'll tell you pretty stories; and when you are weary of your couch, I'l1 fold you in my arms, and rock you so gently to sleep.

"Mamma used to read to me out of the Bible," said little Mary, as her long lashes swept her cheek. Helen started; a bright crimson flush passed over her face, and bending lQW, she kissed the child's forehead reverentially. "About the crucifixion, please," said Mary, as Helen seated herself by her side. That Holy Book! Helen felt as if her hands were" unclean." She began to read; perhaps the print might not have been clear; but she stopped often, and drew her small hand across her eyes. Her voice grew tremulous. Years of worldliness had come between her and that sad, touching story. It came upon her now with startling force and freshness. Earth, with its puerile cares and pleasres, dwindled to a point. Oh, -what "cross " had her shoulders borne . What " crown of thorns " had pierced her brows? How had her careless feet turned aside from the footsteps of Calvary's meek sufferer! "Thank you," said little Mary, rousing Helen from her rev- erie; "mamma used to pray to God to make me patient, and take me to Heaven." "Tears started to Helen's eyes.

Adolph Grey wandered listlessly through that brilliant ball- room. There were sweet voices, and sweeter faces, and grace- ful, floating forms; but his eye rested on -none of them. "Pray, where is Lady Helen?E" said he, -wandering up to his gay hostess, with a slight shade of embarrassment. "Ah, you may well ask that! I'm so vexed at her! Every man in the room is as savage as a New Zealander. She has turned Methodist, that's all. Just imagine; our peerless Helen thumbing greasy hymn-books at vestry meetings, listen- ing to whining preachers, and hunting up poor dirty beggar children! I declare, I thought she had too much good sense. Well, there it is; and you may as well hang your harp on the willows. She'll have nothing to say to you nowa; for you know you are a sinner, Grey." "Very true," said Grey, as he went into the ante-room to cloak himself for a call upon Helen; "I am a sinner; but if any woman can make a saint of me, it is Lady Helen. I have looked upon women only as toys to pass away the time; but under that gay exterior of Helen's there was always something   HELEN.

Nobody ever passed Nelly without asking, 'Who is she.' One can't forget the glance of that blue eye; nor the waving of those golden locks; nor the breezy grace of that lithe figure; nor those scarlet lips; nor the bright, glad sparkle of the whole face; and then, she is not a bit proud, although she steps so like a queen; she would shake hands just as quick with a horny palm as with a kid glove.

Well-a-day! mark my words, he will break her heart before a twelvemonth! He's a pocket edition of Na- poleon." A year had passed by, and amid the hurry of business and the din of the great city, I had quite forgotten Glehburn and its fairy queen. It was a time to recall her to mind, that lovely June morning-- with its soft fleecy clouds, its glad sunlight, its song of birds, and its breath of roses; and so I threw the reins on Romeo's neck, that he might choose his own pace down the sweet-briar path, to John Morrison's cottage. And there sat X John, in the doorway, smoking his pipe, with Towser crouched at his feet, in the same old spot, just as if the sun had never gone down behind the hills since I parted with him.

It was like trying to fetter- the soft west wind, which comes and goes at its own sweet will; and Nelly -who was only another name for Nature--pined and drooped like a bird in a darkened cage. "One by one her old friends dropped off, wearied with re- peated and rude repulses from her moody husband, till he was left, as he desired, master of the field. It was astonishing the ascendency he gained over his sweet wife, contemptible as he was. She made no objection to his most absurd requirements; but her step lost its spring, her eye its sparkle; and one might listen long for her merry-ringing laugh. Slowly, sadly to Nelly came that terrible conviction from which a wife has no appeal. Ah! there is no law to protect woman from negative abuse!- no mention made in the statute book (which men frame for themselves), of the constant dropping of daily dis- comforts which wear the loving heart away-- no allusion to looks or words that are like poisoned arrows to the sinking spirit.

Then you may close the book, and lean your cheek against the cover, as if it were the face of a dear friend; shut your eyes and soliloquise to your heart's content, without fear of misconstruction, even though you should exclaim in the full- ness of your enthusiasm, "What an adorable soul that man has!"You may put the volume under your pillow, and let your eye and the first ray of morning light fall on it together, and no Argus eyes shall rob you of that delicious pleasure, no carping old maid, or strait-laced Pharisee shall cry out, "it is n't proper!"You may have a thousand petty, provoking, irritating annoyances through the day, and you shall come back again to your dear old book, and forget them all in dream land.

"He 's going the wrong way-- straying from the true fold; going off the track," said old Deacon Green, shaking his head ominously, as he saw young Neff enter a church to hear an infidel preacher. "'Can't understand it; he was taught his catechism and ten commandments as soon as he could speak; he knows the right way as well as our parson; I can't un- derstand it." Harry Neff had never seen a day pass since his earliest childhood, that was not ushered in and closed with a family prayer. He had not partaken of a repast upon which the di- vine blessing was not invoked; the whole atmosphere of the old homestead was decidedly orthodox. Novels, plays and Byronic poetry were all vetoed. Operas, theatres and the like most decidedly frowned upon; and no lighter literature was allowed upon the table, than missionary reports and theologi- oal treatises. Most of his father's guests being clergymen, Harry was early made acquainted with every crook and turn of orthodoxy. He had laid up many a clerical conversation, and pondered it in his heart, when they imagined his thoughts on anything but the subject in debate. At his father's request, they had each    THE STRAY SHEEP.           227 and all taken him by the button, for the purpose of long, pri- vate conversations - the, old gentleman generally prefacing his request by the remark that " his heart was as hard as a flint." Harry listened to them all with respectful attention, mani. festing'no sign of impatience, no nervous shrinking from the probing process, and they left him, impressed with a sense of his mental superiority, but totally unable to affect his feelings in the remotest degree. Such a pity! they all said, that he should be so impenetra- ble; such wonderful argumentative powers as he had; such felicity of expression; such an engaging exterior. Such a pity! that on all these brilliant natural gifts should not have been written, "Holiness to the Lord." Yes, dear reader, it was a pity. Pity, when our pulpits are so often filled with those, whose only recommendation for their office is a good heart and a black coat. It was a pity that graceful gesticulation, that rare felicity of expression, that keen perception of the beautiful, that ready tact and adaptation to circumstances and individuals, should not have been effective weapons in the gospel amory. Pity, that voice of music should not have been employed, to chain the worldling's fas. tidious ear to listen to Calvary's story. Yet it was a pity that glorious intellect had been laid at an unholy shrine; pity "he had strayed from   the true fold." How was it? Ah! the solution is simple.

Harry was a keen ob- server. He had often heard the harst and angry word from lips upon which the Saviours name had just lingered. He had felt the unjust, quick, passionate blow from the hand which a moment before had been raised in supplication to Heaven. He had seen the purse-strings relax at the bidding of worldliness, and tighten at the call of charity. He had seen principle sacri- ficed to policy, and duty to interest. He had himself been misap- preciated. The shrinking sensitiveness which drew a vail over his most sacred feelings, had been harshy construed into hard- heartedness and indifference. Every duty to which his atten- tion was called, was prefaced with the supposition that he was averse to its performance. He was cut off from the gay pleasures which buoyant spirits and fresh young life so elo- quently plead f6r; and in their stead no innocent enjoy- ment was substituted. He saw Heaven's gate shut most unceremoniously, upon all who did not subscribe to the pa. rental creed, outraging both his own good sense and the teach- ings of the Bible; and so religion, (which should have been rendered so lovely,) put on to him an ascetic form. Oh, what marvel that the flowers in the broad road were so passing fair to see I that the forbidden fruit of the " tree of knowledge " was so tempting to the youthful touch? Oh, Christian parent! be consistent, be judicious, be cheerful. If, as historians inform us, "no smile ever played " on the lips of Jesus of Nazareth, surely no frown marred the beauty of that holy browa. Dear reader, tru religion is not gloomy. "Her ways are   THE STRAY SHEEP.         229 ways of pleasantness, her paths are peace." No man, no wo- man, has chart or compass, or guiding star, without it. Religion is not a fable. Else why, when our household gods are shivered, do our tearful eyes seek only Heaven? Why, when disease lays its iron grasp on bounding life, does the startled soul so earnestly, so tearfully, so imploringly, call on its forgotten Saviour? Ah! the house " built upon the sand" may do for sunny weather; but when the billows roll, and tempests blow, and lightnings flash, and thunders roar, we need the "Rock of Ages."  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7388-00000122"/> THE FASHONABLE PREACHER. Do you call this a church? Well, I heard a prima-donna here a few nights ago: and bright eyes sparkled, and waving ringlets kept time to moving fans; and opera glasses and ogling, and fashion and folly reigned for the nonce triumphant. I can't forget it; I can't get up any devotion here, under these latticed balconies, with their fashionable freight. If it were a good old country church, with a cracked bell and unhewn raf- ters, a pine pulpit, with the honest sun staring in through the windows, a pitch-pipe in the gallery, and a few hob-nailed rus- tics scattered round in the uncushioned seats, I should feel all right; but my soul is in fetters here; it won't soar - its wings are earth-dipped. Things are all too fine! Nobody can come in at that door, whose hat and coat and bolmet are not fashion- ably cut. The poor man (minus a Sunday suit) might lean on his staff in the porch, a long while, before he 'd dare venture in, to pick up his -crumb of the Bread of Life. But, thank God, the unspoken prayer of penitence may wing its way to the Eternal Throne, though our mocking church spires point only with aristocratic fingers to the rich mans heaven. --That hymn was beautifully read; there's poetry in the preacher's soul.

PIPKIr, I am under the disagreeable necessity of in- forming you, that our family expenses are getting to be enor- mous, I see that carpet woman charged you a dollar for one day's work. Why, that is positively a man's wages;--such presumption is intolerable. Pity you did not make it your- self Mrs. Pipkin; wives ought to lift their end of the yoke; that's my creed. Little Tom Pipkin.--Papa, may I have this bit of paper on the floorS. it is your tailor's bill--says, "$400 for your last year's clothes." Mr. Pipkin.- Tom, go to bed, and learn never to inter- rupt your father when he is talking.

I think I shall get you, too, to take charge of the marketing and providing, (on a stipulated allowance from me, of course,) it will give me so much more time to  attend to business, Mrs. Pipkin. I shall take my own dinners down town at the House. I hear Stevens is an excellent "caterer;" (though that's nothing to me, of course, as my only object in going is to meet business acquaintances ftom different parts of the Union, to drive a bargain, &amp;e., &amp;c.) Well -it will cost you and the children little or nothing for your dinners. There's nothing so disgusting to a man of refinement, like myself, as to see a woman fond of eating; and as to children, any fool knows they ought not to be allowed to stuff their skins, like little anacondas. Yes, our family expen- Ees are enormous. My partner sighed like a pair of bellows at that last baby you had, Mrs. Pipkin; oh, it's quite ruinous-- but I can't stop to talk now, I'm going to try a splendid horse which is offered me at a bargaifn--(too frisky for you to ride, my dear, but just the thing for me.) You had better dismiss your nursery girl this afternoon; that will begin to look like retrenchment.

CAN anybody tell why country people so universally and pertinaciously persist in living in the rear of the house? Can anybody tell why the front door and windows are never opened, save on Fourth of July and at Thankiving time .  Why Zede- kiah, and Timothy, and Jonathan, and the old farmer himself, must go round the house in order to get into it? Why the whole family (oblivious of six empty rooms,) take their " va. por bath," and their meals, simultaneously, in the vicinity of a red hot coolking range, in the dog-days  Why the village artist need paint the roof, and spout, and window frames bright crimson, and the doors the color of a mermaid's tresses? Why the detestable sunflower (which I can never forgive "Tom Moore " for noticing) must always flaunt in the garden? Why the ungraceful prim poplar, fit emblem of a stiff old bachelor, is preferred. to the swaying elm, or drooping willow, or ma- jestic horse-chestnut. I should like to pull down the green paper window-curtains, and hang up some of snowy muslin. I should like to throw wide open the hall door, and let the south wind play through.

I should like to cushion the chairs after the same fashion. Then I should like, when the white-haired old farmer came panting up the road at twelve o'clock, with his scythe hanging over his arm, to usher him into that cool, comfortable room, set his bowl of bread and milk before him, and after he had discussed it,-coax him (instead of tilting back on the hind legs of a hard chair,) to take a ten-minutes nap on my " model" sofi, while I kept my eye on the clouds, to see that no -thunder shower played the mischief with his hay. I should like to place a few common-sense, practical books on the table, with some of our fine daily and weekly papers. You may smile; but these inducements, and the comfortable and pleasant air of the apartment, would bring the family often- er together after the day's toil, and by degrees they would lift the'covers of the books, and turn over the newspapers. Constant interchange of thought, feeling and opinion, with discussions of the important and engrossing questions of the day, would of course necessarily follow. The village tavern-keeper would probably frown upon it; but I will venture to predict for the inmates of the firm-house a growing love for " home," and an added air of intelligence and refinement, of which they themselves might possibly be unconscious.   MADAME ROUILLON'S "MOURNING SALOON." "You need n't make that dress ' deep mourning,' Hetty; the lady who ordered it said it was only her sister for whom she was to 'mourn.' A three-quarter's length vail will answer; and I should introduce a few jet bugles round the bonnet trim. mings. And, by the way, Hetty, Mrs. La Fague's husband has been dead now nearly two months, so that new dress of hers will admit of a little alleviation in the style of trimming - a few knots of love-ribbon on the boddice will have a softening effect; and you must hem a thin net vail for her bonnet; - it's almost time for her to be 'out of mourning.' --"And, Hetty, run down to Stewart's, right away, and see if he has any more of those grief-bordered pocket-handkerchiefs. Mr. Grey's servant said the border must be full an inch deep, as his master wished it for his wife's funeral, and it is the eighth time within eight years that the poor afflicted man has suffered a similar calamity. Remember, Hetty,- an inch deep, with a tomb-stone and a weeping-willow embroidered on the corner, with this motto: 'Hope never dies;'- and, Hettty, be sure you ask him what is the latest style for ' half-mourning' for grandmothers, mothers-in-law, country cousins, and poor 16b  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7388-00000128"/> 242  MADAME ROUILLON'S "MOURNING SALOON." relations.

Yes, I know you ' only put them on last week; ' but they are going to Phil- adelphia, where nobody knows them, and, of course, it is n't necessary to 'mourn' for their mother there.

HOUSEHOLD TYRANTS. "A HUSBANDi may kill a wife gradually, and be no more questioned than the grand seignor who drowns a slave at midnight"- Thackeray, on Household Tyrants. OH! Mr. Thackeray! I ought to have known from experi- ence, that beauty and brains never travel in company - but I was disenchanted when I first saw your nose, and I did say that you were too stout to look intellectual. But I forgive you in consideration of the above paragraph, which, for truth and can- dor, ought to be appended to the four Gospels. I'm on the marrow bones of my soul to you, Mr. Thackeray. I honor you for " turning State's evidence " against your own culprit-sex. If there's any little favor I can do for you, such as getting you naturalized, (for you are a sight too cute and clever for an Englishman,) I'll fly round and get the docu- ments made out for you to-morrow. I tell you, Mr. Thackeray, the laws over here allow hus. bands to break their wives' hearts as much as they like, so long as they don't break their heads. So the only way we can get along, is to allow them to scratch our faces, and then run to the police court, and shew "his Honor" that Mr. Caudle can " make his mark."

P-r-e-t-t-y tall nation for a growing one; don't you think so? Smart men- smarter women-good broad streets- no smoking or spitting allowed in 'em--houses all built with an eye to architectural beauty--newspapers don't tell how maany buttons you wear on your waistcoat-Jonathan never stares at you, as if you were an imported hyena, or stirs you up with the long pole of criticism, to see your size and hear your roar. Our politicians never whip each other on the floor of Congress, and grow black in the face because their choler chokes them! No mushroom aristocracy over here--no "coats of arms" or liveried servants: nothing of that sham sort, in our " great and glorious country," as you have-proba- bly noticed.

"A wife should n't ask her husband for money at meal-times." --dchmage. BT no manner of means; nor at any other time; because, it is to be hoped, he will be gentlemanly enough to spare her that humiliating necessity. Let him hand her his porte-mon- naie every morning, with carte-blanche to help herself The consequence would be, she would lose all desire for the con- tents, and hand it back, half the time without abstracting a sin- gle sou.  It's astonishing men have no more diplomacy about such matters. I should like to be a husband! There are wives whom I verily believe might be trusted to make way with a ten dollar bill without risk to the connubial donor! I'm not speaking of those doll-baby libels upon womanhood, whose chief ambition is to be walking advertisements for the dressmaker; but a rational, refined, sensible woman, who knows how to look like a lady upon small means; who would both love and respect a man less for requiring an ac count of every copper; but who, at the same time, would willingly wear a hat or garment that is "out of date," rather than involve a noble, generous-hearted husband in unnecessary expenditures.  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7388-00000131"/> 248      WOMEN AND MONEY. I repeat it--"It isn't every man who has a call to be a husband." Half the married men should have their " licenses " taken away, and the same number of judicious bachelors put in their places. I think the attention of the representatives should be called to this. They can't expect to come down to town and peep under all the ladies' bonnets the way they do, and have all the newspapers free gratis, and two dollars a day besides, without "paying their way! It's none of my business, but I question whether their wives, whom they left at home, stringing dried apples, know how spruce they look in their new hats and coats, or how facetious they grow with their landlady's daughter; or how many of them pass themselves off for bachelors, to verdant spinsters.

Mrs. Low's hand trembled as she passed her boy's cup. It was his last meal under that roof for many a long day. She did not trust herself to speak --her heart was too full. She heard all his father so injudiciously said to him, and she knew too well from former experience the effect it would have upon his impetuous, fiery spirit. She had only to oppose to it a mother's prayers, and tears, and all-enduring love. She never condemned in Wills hearing, any of his father's philippics; always excusing him with the general remark that he didn't understand him. Alone, she mourned over it; and when with her husband, tried to place matters on a better footing for both parties.  * Will noted his mother's swollen eyelids; he saw his favorite little tea cakes that she had busied herself in preparing for him, and he ate and drank what she gave him, without tasting a morsel he swallowed, listening for the hundredth time to his father's account of " what he did when he was a young man." "Just half an hour, Will," said his father, " before you start; run up and see if you have forgotten any of your duds." It was the little room he had always called his own. How many nights he had lain there listening to the rain pattering on the low roof; how many mornings awakened by the chirp of the robin in the apple-tree under the window.

He knelt at her feet as in the days of childhood, and from those wayward lips came this tearful prayer, "Oh God, spare my mother, that I may look upon her face again in this world!" Oh, in after days, when that voice had died out from under the parental roof, how sacred was that spot to her who gave him birth! There was hope for the boy! he had recogni. zed his mother's God. By that invisible silken cord she still held the wanderer, though broad seas roll between. Letters came to Moss Glen- at stated intervals, then more irregularly, picturing only the bright spots in his sailor life (for Will was proud, and they were to be scanned by his father's eye.) The usual temptations of a sailor's life when in port were not unknown to him. Of every cup the syren Pleasure held to his lips, he drank to the dregs; but there were mo- ments in his maddest revels, when that angel whisper, "God keep my boy," palsied his daring hand, and arrested the half- uttered oath. Disgusted with himself, he would turn aside for an instant, but only to drown again more recklessly "that still small torturing voice."

He asked no leave to enter, but passed over the threshold into the little "best parlor," and found him- self alone with the dead. It was too true! Dumb were the lips that should have welcomed him; and the arms that should have enfolded him were crossed peacefully over the heart that beat true to him till the last. Conscience did its office. Long years of mad folly passed in swifs review before him; and over that insensible form a vow was made, and registered in-Heaven.

No matter if Queen Victoria should ride by, no little brimless hat must go up in the air till the committee had set on it! Oh fudge! I should like to keep school myself. I'd make "rag babies" for the little girls, and "soldier caps" for the boys; and I do n't think I would make a rule that they should not sneeze till school was dismissed; and when their little cheeks began to flush, and their little heads droop wearily on their plump shoulders, I'd hop up and play, "hunt the slipper;" or, if we were in the country, we'd race over the meadow, and catch butterflies, or frogs, or toads, or snakes, or anything on earth except a "school committee"   THE TIME TO CHOOSE.

MEN never look slovenly before breakfast; no, indeed. They never run round in their stoeking feet, vestless, with dressing- gown inside out; soiled handkerchief hanging out of the pocket by one corner. Minus dicky-minus neck-tie; pantaloon straps flying; suspenders streaming from their waisthand; chin shaved on one side, and lathered on the other; halr like porcu- pine quills; face all in a snarl of wrinkles because the fire wont kindle, and because it snows, and because the office boy do n't come for the keys, and because the newspaper has n't arrived, and because they lost a bet the night before, and because there's an omelet instead of a broiled chicken, for breakfast, and be- cause they are out of sorts and shaving soap, out of cigars and credit, and because they can't "get their temper on" till they get some money and a mint julep.

Mrs. Jones drives Mr. Jones distracted, at a regular hour every evening, hammering about " change of scene, and air," and the " health of the dear children;" which, translated, means a quantity of new bonnets and dresses, and a trip to Saratoga, for herself and intimate friend, Miss Hob-Nob; while Jones takes his meals at a restaurant--sleeps in the deserted house, sews on his missing buttons and dickey strings, and spends his leisure time where Mrs. Jones don't visit.

Close at my elbow sits a rough countryman, with so much "free soil" adhering to his brogans they might have been used for beet-beds, and a beard rivaled only by Nebuchadnezzar's when he experimented on a grass diet. He has only one word to express hisoverpowering emotions at the glowing panorama before us, and that is "pooty,"--houses, trees, sky, rafts, rail- road cars and river, all are "pooty;" and when, in the fulness of a soul craving sympathy, he turned to his dairy-fed Eve to endorse it, that matter-offact feminine shower-bath-ed his en- thusiasm, by snarling out "pooty enough, I 'spose, but where 's my breakfast?" Ah! here we are at the pier, at last. And now they emerge, our night-travelers, from state-room and cabin into the fresh cool air of the morning. Venus and Apollo! what a crew. Solemn as a hearse, surly as an Englishman, blue as an indigo- bag! There's a poor shivering babe, twitched from a warm bed by an ignorant young mother, to encounter the chill air of morning, with only a flimsy covering of lace and embroidery; - there's a languid southern belle, creeping out, a la tortoise, and turning up her little aristocratic nose as if she sniffed a pes- tilence; there 'o an Irish bride (green as Erin) in a pearl-col- ored silk dress surmounted by a coarse blanket shawl;- there's a locomotive hour-glass, (alips a dandy,) a blue-eyed, cravat-choked, pantaloon be-striped, vest-garnished, disgusting "institution!"

Now, queenly beauty sweeps past, in sin's gay livery. Cursed he who first sent her forth, to walk the earth, with her woman's brow shame-branded. Fair mother- pure wife - frown scornfully at her if you can; my heart aches for her. I see one who once slept, sweet and fair, on a mother's loving breast. I see one whose bitterest tear may never wash her stain away. I see one on whom mercy's gate is forever shut, by her own unrelenting, unforgiv- ing sex. I see one who was young, beautiful, poor and friend- less. They who make long prayers, and wrap themselves up in self-righteousness, as with a garment, turned a deaf ear, as she plead for the bread of honest toil.

How unmercifully the heavy cart wheels rattle over the stony pavements; how unceasing the tramp of busy, restless feet; how loud and shrill the cries of mirth and traffic. You turn heavily to your heated pillow, murmuring, "Would' God it were night!"The pulse of the great city is stilled at last; and balmy sleep, so coveted, seems about to bless you - when hark! a watchman's rattle is sprung beneath your window, evoking a score of stentorian voices, followed by a clanging bell, and a rushing engine, announcing a conflagration. Again you turn to your sleepless pillow; your quivering nerves and throb- bing temples sending to your pale lips this prayer, "Would to God it were morning!  Death comes, and releases you. You are scarcely missed. Your next-door neighbor, who has lived within three feet of you for three years, may possibly recollect -having seen the doctor's chaise before your door, for some weeks past; then, that the front blinds were closed; then, that a coffin was car- ried in; and he remarks to his wife, as he takes up the evening paper, over a comfortable dish of tea, that "he should n't won- der if neighbor Grey were dead," and then they read your  &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7388-00000142"/> 270    SICKNESS IN THE COUNTRY. name and age in the bill of mortality, and wonder "what dis- ease you died of; " and then the servant removes the tea-tray, and they play a game of whist, and never think of you again, till they see the auctioneer's flag floating before your door. The house is sold; and your neighbor sees your widow and little ones pass out over the threshold in tears and sables (grim poverty keeping them silent company); but what of that? The world is full of widows and orphans; one can't always be thinking of a charnel-house; and so he returns to his stocks and dividends, and counting-room, and ledger, in a philosophical state of serenity. Some time after, he is walking with a friend; and meets a lady in rusty mourning, carrying a huge bundle, from which "slop work?' is seen protruding, (a little child accompanies her, with its feet out at the toes.) She has a look of hopeless mis. ery on her fine but sad features. She is a lady still (spite of her dilapidated wardrobe and her bundle.) Your neighbor's companion touches his arm, and says, "Good God! isn't that Grey's widow?" He glances at her carelessly, and answers, "Should n't wonder;" and invites him home to dine on trout, cooked in claret, and hot-house peaches, at half a dollar a-piece.

From your pillow you can watch the shadows come and go, over the clover meadow, as the clouds go drifting by. Rustic neighbors lean on their spades at sunset at your door, and with sympathising voices "hope you are bet- ter." The impatient hoof of the prancing horse is checked by the hand of pity; and the merry shout of the sunburnt child (musical lnough it be,) dies on the cherry lip; at the uplifted finger of compassion. A shower of rose-leaves drifts in over your pillow, on the soft sunset zephyr. Oh, earth is passing fair; but Heaven is fairer! Its portals unclose to you! Kind, neighborly hands wipe the death-damp from your brow; speak words of comfort to your weeping wife, caress your unconscious children. Your fading de takes it all in, but your tongue is powerless to speak its thanks. They close your drooping lids, they straighten your manly limbs, they lay your weary head on its grassy pillow, they bedew it with sympathetic tears; they pray God, that night, in their cottage homes, to send His kind angel down, to whisper words of peace to the broken hearts you have left be- hind. They do something besides pray. From unknown hands, the widow's "cruse of oil," and "barrel of meal," are oft replen- ished. On your little orphans' headxlany a rough palm is laid, with tearful blessing. Many a dainty peach, or pear, or apple is tossed them, on their way to sctool.

IT was a simple dress of snowy muslin, innocent of the magi touch of a French modiste. There was not an inch of lace upon it, nor a rosette, nor a flower; it was pure, and simple,and un- pretending as its destined wearer.

Did I say there was no bridal trousseau? There was one gift, a little clasp Bible, with "Meta Grey" written on the fly- leaf, in the bridegroom's bold, handsome hand. Perchance some gay beauty, who reads this, may curl her rosy lip scorn. fully; but well Meta knew how to value such a gift. Through long dreary years of orphanage " God's Word" had been to her what the star in the East was to Bethlehem's watching shepherds. Her lonely days of toil were over now.

Care? - he did n't know it! Trouble? - what trouble could he have, when all his heart craved on earth was bounded by his clasping arms And then, Meta was an orphan--he was scarcely sorry -there would be none for her heart to go out to now but himself; he must be brother, sister, father, mother -all to her; and his heart gave a full and joyful response to each and every claim. -But what a little loiterer!

I have not dared to say my soul was my own since the day I was married, and every time Mr. Jones comes into the entry and sets down that great cane of his, with a thump, you might hear my teeth chatter, down cellar!

Do have pity on me, and initiate me into the mysteries of broiling, baking, and roasting; take me into your kitchen now, and let me go into it while the fit is on me.

Very patiently did Mrs. Kitty keep her resolution; each day added a little to her store of culinary wisdom. What if she did flavor her first custards with peppermint instead of lemon? What if she did " baste " a turkey with saleratus instead of salt? What if she did season the stuffing with ground cinna- mon instead of pepper?

All the morning the little wife had been getting up a congratulatory dinner, in honor of the occasion. What with satifaction and the kitchen fire, her cheeks glowed like a milkmaid's. How her eyes sparkled, and what a pretty little triumphant toss she gave her head, when that big trunk was dumped down in the entry! It is n't a bad thing, sometimes, to have a secret even from one's own hus- band. "On my word, Kitty," said Harry, holding her off at arm's length, "you look most provokingly 'well-to-do' for a widow 'pro tem.' I don't believe you have mourned for me the breath of a sigh.

"How Bridget has improved," said Harry, as he plied his knife and fork industriously; "I never saw these woodcock outdone, even at our bachelor club-rooms at   House. She shall have a present of a pewter cross, as sure as her name is McFlanigan, besides absolution for all the detestable messes she used to concoct with her Catholic fingers."

I know very well when three is a crowd, or, to speak more fashionably, when I am ' de trop,' and I'm only going to stop long enough to reinid you that there are some wives left in the world, and that Kitty is one of 'em."

WHAT a warm Sunday! and what a large church! I won- der if it will be half-filled! Empty pews are a sorry welcome to a pastor. Ah! no fear; here comes the congregation in troops and families; now the capacious galleries are filled; every pew is crowded, and seats-are being placed in the aisles. The preacher rises. What a young "David!"  Still, the "stone and sling " will do their execution. How simple, how child-like that prayer; and yet how eloquent, how fervent. How eagerly, as he names the text, the eye of each is riveted upon the preacher, as if to secure his individual portion of the heavenly manna. Let us look around, upon the audience. Do you see yonder gray-haired business man a Six days in the week, for many years, he has been Mammon's most devoted worshipper. Ac. cording to time-honored custom, he has slept comfortably in his own pew each Sunday, lulled by the soft voice of the shep. herd who "prophesieth smooth things."   One pleasant Sab. bath, chance, (I would rather say an overruling Providence,) led him here. He settles himself in his accustomed Sunday attitude, but sleep comes not athis bidding. He looks dis- turbed. The preacher is dwelling upon the permitted but  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7388-00000150"/> 286      HENRY WARD BEECHERB. fraudulent tricks of business men, and exposing plainly their turpitude in the sight of that God who holds " evenly the scales of justice." As he proceeds, Conscience whispers to this aged listener, "Thou art the man!" He moves uneasily on his seat; an angry flush mounts to his temples: What right has that boy-preacher to question the integrity of men of such un- blemi shed mercantile standing in the community as himself? He is not accustomed to such a spiritual probing knife. .His spiritual physician has always " healed the hurt of his people slightly." He don't like such plain talking, and sits the ser- vice out only from compulsion. But when he passes the church porch, he does not leave the sermon there, as usual. No. He goes home perplexed and thoughtful. Conscience sides with the preacher; self-interest tries to stifle its voice with the sneering whisper of " priestcraft." Monday comes, and again he plunges into the maelstrom of business, and tries to tell the permitted lie with his usual nonchalance to some ig- norant customer, but his tongue falters and performs its duty but awkwardly; a slight blush is perceptible upon his counter nance; and the remainder of the week chronicles similar and repeated failures. Again it is Sunday. He is not a church-member: he can stay at home, therefore, without fear of a canonical commit- tee of Paul Prys to investigate the matter: he can look over his debt and credit list if he likes, without excommunication: he certainly will not put himself again in the way of that plain-spoken, stripling priest. The bell peals out, in musical tones, seemingly this summons: "Come up with us, and we   HENRY WARD BEEOHER.          287 will do you good."

Because they see that he stands in that sacred desk, not that his lips may be tamed and held in, with a silver bit and silken bridle: not because preaching is his " trade," and his hearers must receive their quid pro quo once a week-no, they all see and feel that his heart is in the work-that he loves it--that he comes to them fresh from his closet, his face shining with the light of " the Mount," as did Moses'. The preacher is remarkable for fertility of imagination, for rare felicity of expression, for his keen perception of the com- plicated and mysterious workings of the human heart, and for the uncompromising boldness with which he utters his convic- tions. His earnestness of manner, vehemence of gesture and rapidity of utterance, are, at times, electrifying; impressing his hearers with the idea that language is too poor and mea- ger a medium for the rushing tide of his thoughts. Upon the lavish beauty of earth, sea, and sky, he has evi- dently gazed with the poet's eye of rapture. He walks the green earth in no monk's cowl or cassock.

Don't you go down on your marrow-bones, and vow that the owner is a Venus, a Hebe, a Juno, a sylph, a fairy, an angel? Would-you stop to look (connubially) at the most bewitching woman on earth, whose only diamonds were "in her eye?"    Well, it is no great marvel, Mr. Punch. The race of men is about extinct. Now and then you will meet with a specimen; but I'm sorry to inform you- that the most of them are nothing but coat tails, walking behind a moustache, destitute of sufficient energy to earn their own cigars and "Macassar," preferring to dangle at the heels of a diamond wife, and meekly receive their allow- ance, as her mamma's prudence and her own inclinations may suggest.  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7388-00000153"/> FATHER TAYOR, THE SAILOR'S PREACHER. YoU have never heard FATHER TAYOR, the Boston Sea- man's preacher  Well-you should go down to his church some Sunday. It is not at the court-end of the town. The urchins in the neighborhood are guiltless of shoes or bonnets. You will see quite a sprinkling of "Police " at the corners. Green Erin, too, is well represented: with a dash of Africa- hoecked off with " dough faces." Let us go into the church: there are no stained-glass win- dows - no richly draperied pulpit - no luxurious seats to sug- gest a nap to your sleepy conscience. No odor of patchouli, or nonpareil, or bouget de violet will be wafted across your pa- trician nose. Your satin and broadcloth will fail to procure you the highest seat in the synagogue,--they being properly re- served for the " old salts." Here they come! one after another, with horny palms and bronzed faces. It stirs my blood, like the sound of a trum- pet, to see them.

God bless the sailor!- Here they come; sure of a welcome- conscious that they are no intruders on aristocratic landsmen's soil- sure that each added face will send a thrill of pleasure to the heart of the good old man, who folds them all, as one family, to his patriarchal bosom. There he is! How reverently he drops on his knee, and ut- ters that silent prayer. Now he is on his feet. With a quick motion he adjusts his spectacles, and says to the tardy tar doubtful of a berth, "Room here, brother!" pointing to a seat in the pulpit. Jack don't know about that!. He can climb the rigging when Boreas whistles his fiercest blast; he can swing into the long boat with a stout heart, when creaking tim bers are parting beneath him: but to mount the pzulpit!  Jack doubts his qualifications, and blushes through his mask of bronze., "Room enough, brother!!"Kin reassures him ; and, with a litle extra fumbling at his tarpaulin, and hitching at his -waisthand, he is soon as much at home as though he were on his vessel's deck. The hymn is read with a heart-tone. There is no mistaking either the poet's meaning or the reader's devotion. And now, if you have a " scientific musical ear," (which, thank heaven, I have not,) you may criticise the singing, while I am not ashamed of the tears that steal down my face, as I mark the effect of good Old Itundred (minus trills and flourishes) on Neptune's honest, hearty, whole-souled sons.  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7388-00000154"/> 294        FATHER   TAYOR. --The text is announced.

My pen fails to convey to you the play of expression on that earnest face--those emphatic ges- tures-- the starting tear or the thrilling voice; - but they all tell on "Jack."

There's a poor, distracted gentleman in a milliner's shop, trying to select a bonnet for his spouse. What a non compos! See him poise the airy nothings on his great clumsy hands! He is' about as good a judge of bonnets as I am of patent ploughs. See him turn, in despairing bewilderment, from blue to pink, from pink to green, from green to crimson, from crim- son to yellow. The little witch of a milliner sees his indecis- ion, and resolves to make a coup d'tat; so, perching one of the bonnets (blue as her eyes) on her rosy little face, she walks up sufficiently near to give him a magnetic shiver, and holding the strings coquettishy under her pretty little chin, says: "Now, I'm sure, you can't say that is n't pretty!" Of course he can't! So, the bonnet is bought and band-boxed, and Jonathan (who is sold with the bonnet) takes it home to -his wife, whose black face looks in it like an overcharged thunder-cloud set in a sil. ver lining.

What a heap of peo- ple! What a job it must be to take the census in New York. Servant girls and their beaux, country folks and city folks, big boys and little boys, ladies and women, puppies and men! There 's a poor laboring man with his market basket on one arm, and his wife on the other. He knows that he can get his Sunday dinner cheaper by purchasing it late on Saturday night, when the butchers are not quite sure that their stock will "keep" till Monday. And then it is quite a treat for his wife, when little Johnny is asleep, to get out to catch a bit of fresh air, and a sight of the pretty things in the shop windows, even if she cannot have them; but the little feminine diplomat- ist knows that husbands always feel clever of a Saturday night, and that then's the time "just to stop and look " at a new ribbon or collar. See that party of country folks, going to the National " to see "Uncle Tom." Those pests, the bouquet sellers, are offer. ing them their stereotyped, cabbage-looking bunches of flowers with, "Please buy one for your lady, sir." Jonathan don't understand dodging such appeals; beside, he would scorn to begrudge a "quarter" for his lady! So he buys the nuisance, and scraping out his hind foot, presents it, with a bow, to Araminta, who " walks on thrones" the remain. der of the evening.

A look of hopeless misery settled over the young girl's face, as she turned slowly away in the direction of home. Home did I say? The word was a bitter mockery to poor Mary. She had a home once, where she and the little birds sang the live-long day: where flowers blossomed, and tall trees waved, and merry voices floated out on the fragrant air, and the golden sun went gorgeously down behind the far-off hills; where a mother's loving breast was her pillow, and a father's good-night blessing wooed her rosy slumbers.

Rank grass had o'ergrown the cottage gravel walks; weeds choked the flowers which dust-crumbled hands had planted; the brown moss had thatched over the cottage eaves, and still the little birds sang on as blithely as if Mary's household gods had not been shivered. Poor Mary! The world was dark and weary to her; the very stars, with their serene beauty, seemed to mock her mis- ery. She reached her little room. Its narrow walls seemed to close about her like a tomb. She leaned her head wearily against the little window, and looked again at the great house opposite. How brightly, how cheerfully the lights glanced from the windows! How like fairies glided the young girls over the softly carpeted floors! How swiftly the carriages whirled to the door, with their gay visitors? Life was such a rosy dream to them-such a brooding nightmare to her! Despair laid its icy hand on her heart. Must she always drink, unmixed, the cup of sorrow? Must she weep and sigh her youth away, while griping Avarice trampled on her heart- strings? She could not weep-nay, worse-she could not pray.

Surely--surely, this is better than to toil, weeping, through the long weary days in the little darkened room. Is it, Mary? There is a ring at the door of the great house. A woman glides modestly in; by her dress, she is a widow. She has opened a small school in the neighborhood, and in the search for scholars has wandered in here. She looks about her. Her quick, womanly instinct sounds the alarm. She is not among the good and pure of her sex. But she does not scorn them. No; she looks upon their blighted beauty, with a Christ-like pity; she says to herself haply some word of mine may touch their hearts.

A policeman's strong grasp is laid upon her arm, and she is hurried, struggling, through the dripping streets, and pushed into the nearest " station house." Morning dawns upon the wretched, forsaken outcast. She sees it not. Upon those weary eyes only the resurrection morn shall dawn.

The tidy little housewife, who, in neat little breakfast-cap and dressing-gown, overlooks the short-comings of careless cook and house-maid; explores cupboards, cellars, pantries, and closets; disembowels old bags% old boxes, old barrels, old kegs, old firkins; who, with her own dainty hand, prepares the favor- ite morsel for the dear, absent, toiling husband, or, by the cheer- ful nursery fire, sews on the missing string or button, or sings to soothing slumbers a pair of violet eyes, whose witching coun- terpart once stole her girlish heart away. Who loves a rainy day? I do!

What is this? only a pressed flower; but it tells me of a shadowy wood - of a rippling brook - of a bird's song- of a mossy seat-- of whispered leaf-music - of, dark, soul-lit eyes - of a voice sweet, and low, and thrilling - of a vow never broken till death chilled the lips that made it.

I've ridden in an omnibus, heard a Fourth-of-July oration, and I once saw the sun rise; but I never, never never saw " a conscientious young man." If there is such an " organization " on the periphery of this globe, I should like to see him. If he is, where is he? Who owns him? Where did they raise him? What does he feed on? For whom does he vote? On what political platform do his conscientious toes rest? Does he know the difference between a Whig and a Democrat? between a "Hunker " and a "Barnburner?" between a " hard-shell" and a " soft-shell?" between a "uniform national currency" and a "sound consti-   A CONSCIENTIONS YOUNG      MAN.    3" tutional currency?"

Look at that splendid house, with its massive door- way, its mammoth plate-glass windows, its tasteful conserva- tory, where the snowy Orange blossom, and clustering Rose, and crimson Cactus, and regal Passion-flower, and fragrant He- liotrope breath out their little day of sweetness. See that Gothic stable, with its faultless span of horses, and liveried coachman, and anti-republican carriage, whose coat of arms makes our National Eagle droop his fearless pinions. Then cast your eye on that tumble-down, wooden grocery adjoining, send- ing up its reeking fumes of rum, onions, and salt fish, into pa- trician nostrils! Go where you will in New York, you see the same strong contrasts. Feast your eyes on beauty, and a skel- eton startles you at its side. Lazarus sitteth ever at the Gate of Dives. Here is a primary school: what a host of little ragged ur- chins are crowding in! Suppose I step in quietly among them.

There's an Irishman seated on the withered grass, with his spade beside him, leaning wearily against that leafless tree. I wonder is he ill? I must walk that way and speak to him.

Ah, I see: a woman approaches from yonder path; now she seats herself beside him, on the grass, and drawing the cover from a small tin kettle, she bends over the steaming con- tents, and says, with a smile, that is a perfect heart-warmer, "Dear Dennis!"Oh, what a wealth of love in those two sim- ple words; what music in that voice!

How for a brief moment the callous heart grows kindly, and we forget the mote in our brother's eye, and cease to re- pulse the outspread palm of charity, and recognise the claims of a common brotherhood; and then how the sweeping tide comes rolling over us, and the clink of dollars and cents drowns "the still small voice," and Eternity recedes, and Earth only seems tangible, and Mammon, and Avarice, and Folly rule the never returning hours.

Countrymen stand agape while pickpockets lighten them of their purses; innocent little children, with saucer eyes, shy to the further edge of the sidewalk, and hurry home with an embryo night- mare in their frightened craniums. "Jonathan" pays his "quarter," and is astonished to find upon entering, a very tame collection of innocent beasts and beastesses, guiltless of any in- tention to growl, unless poked by the long pole of curiosity.

Well; two-headed calves, one-eyed buffaloes, skeleton os- triches, and miles of serpents, are every day matters; but yon- der is an announcement that "Two Wild Men from Borneo" may be seen within. Now that interests me. "They have the faculty of speech, but are deficient in memory." Bless me, you don't mean to say that those little Hop o' my Thumbs have the temerity to call themselves "Men?" little humbug, pocket editions.

Nothing like a barrier to make femininity leap over. I'm bent upon having the first "adult" shake. The keeper says, "Better not, Ma'am," (showing a scar on hisfinger,) " they bit that een-a-most to the bone." Of course, snapping at masculinity, is no proof to me of their unusceptibility to feminine evangelization; on the contrary.

You will always see Mrs. Judkins in her place at the sunrise prayer-meeting. She is secretary to the "Moral Reform," "Abolition," "Branch Colporteur and Foreign Mission "Socie- ties. She is tract distributor, manager of an "Infant School," cuts out all the work for the Brown Steeple Sewing Cirdcle; belongs to the "Select Female Prayer Meeting;" goes to the Friday night church meeting, Tuesday evening lecture, and Saturday night Bible Class, and attends three services on Sun- day. Every body says, "What an eminent Christian is Mrs. Judkins!" Mrs. Judkins' house and servants take care of themselves. Her little boys run through the neighborhood, peeping into grocery and provision stores, loitering at the street corners, and throwing stones at the passers-by. Her husband comes home to a disorderly house, eats indigestible dinners, and returns to his gloomy counting-room, sighing that his hard earnings are wasted, and his children neglected; and sneering at the religion which brings forth such questionable fruits.   TWO PICTURES.           !31 -MRS. Brown is a church member. Mrs. Judkins has called upon her, and brought the tears into her mild blue eyes, by telling her that she in particular, and -the church in general, have been pained to notice Mrs. Brown's absence from the various religious gatherings and societies above mentioned; that it is a matter of great grief to them, that she is- so lukewarm, and does not enjoy religion as much as they do. Mrs. Brown has a sickly infant; her husband (owing to sad reverses) is in but indifferent circumstances; they have but one inexperienced servant. All the household outgoings and incom- ings, must be carefully watched, and looked after. The little wailing infant is never out of the maternal arms, save when its short slumbers give her a momentary reprieve. Still, the little house is in perfect order. The table tasteful and tempt- ing, although the bill of fare is unostentatious; the children are obedient, respectful, happy and well cared for. Morning and evening, amid her varied and pressing cards, she bends the knee in secret, to Him whom her maternal heart recognizes as "My Lord and my God."   No mantle of dust shrouds the Holy Book." The sacred household altar flame never dies out. Little dimpled hands are reverently folded; little lips lisping say, "Our Father."   Half a day on each returning Sabbath, finds the patient mother in her accustomed place in the sanctu- ary. At her hearth and by her board, the holy man of God hath smiling welcome.

A PARIS LETTER says:-Lady Montijo has left Paris for Spain. She was ex- tremely desirous of remaining and living in the reflection of her daughter's grandeur, but Louis Napoleon, who shares in the general prejudice against step-mothers, gave her plainly to understand, that because he had married Eugenia, she must not sup- pose he had married her whole family. She was allowed to linger six weeks, to have the entree of the Tuileries, and to see her movements chronicled in the Pays. She mhs at last left us, and the telegraph mentions her arrival at Orleans, on her way to the Peninsula. THERE Teba! did not I say you would need all those two- thousand-franc pocket-handkerchiefs before your orange wreath had begun to give signs of wilting? Why did you let your mamma go, you little simpleton? Before Nappy secured your neck in the matrimonial noose, you should have had it put down, in black and white, that Madame Montijo was to live with you till -  the next revolution, if you chose to have her. Now you have struck your colors, of course everything will "go by the board." I tell you Teba, that a fool is the most unmanageable of all beings. He is as dogged and perverse as a broken-down donkey. You can neither goad nor coax him into doing anything he should do, or prevent his doing what he should not do. You will have to leave Nappy and come over here;-- and then everybody will nudge somebody's elbow and   "ETTER TO THE EMPRESS EUGENIA.       335 say, ' That is Mrs. Teba Napoleon; who does not live with her husband." And some will say it is your fault; and others will say 'tis his; and all will tell you a world more about it, than you can tell them. Then, Mrs. Samuel Snip (who has the next room to yours, who murders the king's English most ruthlessly, and is not quite certain whether Barnum or Christopher Columbus dis. covered America,) will have her Paul Pry ear to the keyhole of your door about every other minute, (except when her hus- band is on duty,) to find out if you are properly employed;- and no matter what Mrs. Snip learns, or even if she-does not learn anything, she will be pretty certain to report, that, in her opinion, you are "no better than you should be." If you dress well (with your splendid form and carriage you could not but seem well-dressed) she will 1' wonder how you got the means to do it"; prefacing her remark with the self-evident truth that, " to be sure, it is none of her business." If you let your little Napoleon get out of your sight a min- ute, somebody will have him by the pinafore and put him through a catechism about his mamma's mode of living and how she spends her time. If you go to church, it will be " to show yourself;" if you stay at home, " you are a publican and a sinner." Do what you will, it will all be wrong: if you do nothing, it will be still worse.

MUSIC IN THE NATURAL WAY. How often, when wedged in a heated concert room, an. noyed by the creaking of myriad fans, and tortured optically, by the glare of gas-light, have I, with a gipsey longing, wished that the four walls might be razed, leaving only the blue sky over my head, that the tide of music might unfettered flow over my soul. How often, when dumb with delight, in the midst of some scene of surpassing natural beauty, have I silently echoed the poet's words: "Give me music, or I die." My dream was all realized at a promenade concert at Cas- tle Garden, last night. Shall I ever forget it? That glorious expanse of sea, glittering in the moonbeams; the little boats gliding smoothly over its polished surface; the cool, evening zephyr, fanning the brow wooingly; the music- soothing - thrilling--then quickening the pulse and stirring the blood, like the sound of a trumpet; then, that rare boon, a compan- ion, who had the good taste to be- dumb, and not disturb my trance. There was one drawback. After the i doxology, I noticed 22b  &#xD;<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC7388-00000177"/> 338    MUSIC IN TIE NATURAL WAY. some matter-of-fact wretches devouring ice creams.

But, alas! bonnets, shoes and hose will wear out, and shopkeepers will chuckle over the sad necessity that places the unhappy owners within their dry-goods clutches. Felicitous Mrs. Figleaf! why taste that Paradisaical apple . Some victimised females frequent the stores where soiled and damaged goods are skillfully announced as selling at an "immense sacrifice," by their public-spirited and disinterested owners. Some courageously venture into more elegant estab- lishments, where the claim of the applicant to notice, is meas- ured by the costliness of her apparel, anndwhere the clerks poise their eyeglass at any plebeian shopperess bold enough to inquire for silk under six dollars a yard. Others, still, are tortured at the counter of some fussy old bachelor, who always ties up, with distressing deliberation, every parcel he takes down for in- spection, before he can open another, and moves round to exe- cute your orders as if Mt.

The answer seems to me to be contained in six let. ters -"Stewart's." "Stewart's?"I think I hear some old lady exclaim, drop- ping her knitting and peering over her spectacles; "Stewart's! yes, if you have the mines of California to back you." Now I have a profound respect for old ladies, as I stand self-pledged to join that respectable body on the advent of my very first gray hair; still, with due deference to their catnip and penny- royal experience, I conscientiously repeat-"Stewart's." You may stroll through his rooms free to gaze and admire, without being annoyed by an impertinent clerk dogging your footsteps; you can take up a fabric, and examine it, without being bored by a statement of its immense superiority over every article of the kind in the market, or without being deaf- ened by a detailed account of the enormous sums that the mushroom aristocracy have considered themselves but too hap- py to expend, in order to secure a dress from that very desira- ble, and altogether unsurpassed, and unsurpassable, piece of goods! You can independently say that an article does not exactly suit you, though your husband may not stand by you with a drawn sword. You will encounter no ogling, no impertinent cross-questioning, no tittering whispers, from the quiet, well- bred clerks, who attend to their own business and allow you to attend to yours. Tis true that you may see at Stewart's, cobweb laces an inch   "ADIES THAT "GO SHOPPING."        341 or two wide, for fifty or one hundred dollars a yard, which ma- ny a brainless butterfly of fashion is supremely happy in sport. ing: but at the very next counter you may suit yourself, or your country cousin, to a sixpenny calico, or a chilling de laine; and, what is better, be quite as sure that her verdant queries will be as respectfully answered as if liveried Pompey stood waiting at the door to hand her to her carriage. You can go into the silk department, where, by a soft de- scending light, you will see dinner dresses that remind you of a shivered rainbow, for passd married ladies who long since ceased to celebrate their birth-days, and who keep their bud- ding daughters carefully immured in the nursery: or, at the same counter, you can select a modest silk for your minister's wife, at six shillings a yard, that will cause no heart-burnings in the most Argus-eyed of Paul Pry parishes. Then if you patronise those ever-to-be-abominated and al- ways-to-be-shunned nuisances called parties, where fools of both sexes gather to criticise their host and hostess, and cut up cha- racters and confectionary, you can step into that little room from which day-light is excluded, and select ai evening dress, by gas-light, upon the effect of which you can, of course, de- pend, and to which artistic arrangement many a New York belle has probably owed that much prized possession her "Iast conquest."

Now you can peep into the cloak room, and bear away on your graceful shoulders a six, twenty, thirty, or four hundred dollar cloak, as the length of your husband's purse, or your own fancy (which in these degenerate days amounts to pretty much  the same thing) may suggest. Then there is the wholesale department, where you will see shawls, hosiery, flannels, calicoes, and de laines, sufficient to stock all the nondescript country stores, to say nothing of city con- sumption. Now, if you are not weary, you can descend (under ground) into the carpet department, from whence you can hear the in- cessant roll of full-freighted omnibuses, the ceaseless tramp of myriad restless feet, and all the busy train of out-door life made audible in all the dialects of Babel. Here you can see every variety of carpet, from the homespun, unpretending straw, oil cloth, and Kidderminster, to the gorgeous Brussels and tapestry, (above whose traceried buds and flowers the daintiest foot might well poise itself, loth to crush,) up to the regal Ax- minster, of Scottish manufacture, woven without seam, and warranted, in these days of late suppers and tobacco smoking, to last a life-time.

I wanted to inquire what ailed Jerusha, so I waited to see him. I wanted to ask him how long it would take him to cure her, and if he preferred pills to powders, blisters to plasters, oat-meal to barley-gruel, wine-whey to posset, arrow-root to fariua, and a few such little things, you know. He stared at me over his dicky, as if I had been an unevangelized kangaroo; then he sidled up to Jerusha, pryed open her mouth, and said "humph" --in Latin. Then he crossed his legs, and rolled up the whites of his eyes at the ceiling, as if he expected some Esculapian hand- writing on the wall to enlighten him as to the seat of Aunt Je- rusha's complaint. Then, he drew from his pocket a box with a whole army of tiny bottles; and uncorking two of them he nipped out a little white speck from each, which he dissolved in four quarts of water, and told Jerusha " to take a drop of the water once in eight hours." Tom Thumb and Lilliput! he might as well have tried to salt the Atlantic Ocean with a wid- ower's tear! He should be laid gently on a lily leaf, and con- signed to the first stray zephyr.

And then he braced you up with Iron and Quinine, till your mus- cles were like whip-cords, and your hair in a bristle of kinks. He was human-like, too; he did n't stalk in as if Napoleon and the Duke of Wellinton were boiled down to make his grand- father. No; he'd just as lief sit down on a butter-firkin as on a velvet lounge. He 'd pick up Aunt Esther's knitting- needles, and talk to grandpa about Bunker Hill, and those tee- totally discomfrizzled, bragging British, and offer grandma a pinch of snuffl and trot the baby, and stroke the cat, and go to the closet and eat up the pickles and doughnuts, and make him- self useful generally. He did n't have to stupefy his patients with ether, so that they need n't find out how clumsily he ope- rated. No; it was quite beautiful to see him take a man's head between his knees, and drag his double teeth out. He did n't write a prescription for molasses and water, in High Dutch: he did n't tell you that you were booked for the river Styx, and he was the only M.

Foot-weary, he travels through the crowded streets; his thread- bare coat, and napless hat, and dejected face, all unnoticed by the thriving young merchant, whom the old man helped to hi5 present prosperous business position. The birth-days of his delicate daughter come and go, all unmarked by the joy-be. stowing gift. With trouble and exposure, sickness comes at last: then, the tardy foot, and careless, professional touch of the callous-hearted dispensary doctor: then, the poor man's hearse stands before the door; then winds unheeded through busy streets, to the "Potter's field," while his former cotem- poraries take up the daily paper,'and sipping their wine, say carelessly, wa if they had a quit-claim from sorrow, "Well, Old Smith, the broken-down millionaire, is dead."

THc Smiths have just been moving. They always move for the last tme," on the first of;May. "Horrid custom!" exclaims Smith, wiping the perspiration from his brow, and pulling up his depressed dickey. "How my blood curdles and my bones ache, at the thought!" It was on Tuesday, the third of May, that the afflicting rite was celebrated. Casten -four of them - were engaged the Saturday previous, to be on hand at six o'clock on Tuesday morning, to transport thehousehold goods from the habitation of'52-3 to that of'53-4. Smith was to pay them three dollars each - twelve dollars in all They would not come for a mill less; Smith tried them thoroughly. On Mootiday, Smith's house is turned into a sort of Bedlam, miron- the beds. They are tied up, ready for the next morning's Hegira; the Smiths sleeping on the floor on Monday night. Smith can't seep on the floor; he grows restless; he receives constnt reminders from Mrs. Smith .to take his elbow out of the baby's fice; he has horrid visions and rolls about: there- fore, he is not at all surprised, on waking at cockcrow, to find his head in the fire-place, and his hair powdered with soot.

He dreamed that he had rolled off the world backwards, and lodged in a thor-bush. Of course, such a thing was slightly improbable; but how could Smith be re- sponsible for a dream?  On Tuesday morning, the Smiths are up with the dawn. The household being mustered, it is found that the servant girl, who had often averred that, " she lived out, just for a little ex- ercise," had deserted her colors. The grocer on the corer po. litely informs Smith, (whom Mrs. S. had sent on an errand of inquiry) that, on the night previous, the servant left with him a message for her employers, to the effect that " she did n't con- sider moving the genteel thing, at all; and that a proper re- gard for her character and position in society, had induced her to get a situation in the family of a gentleman who owned the house h lived in," This is severe: Smith feels it keenly; Mrs. Smith leans her head against her husband's vest pattern, and says "She is quite crushed," and "wonders how Smith can have the heart to whistle. But, it is always so," she remarks. "Woman is the weaker vessel, and man delights to trample on her." Smith indignantly denies this sweeping assertion, and says "he tramples on nothing;" when Mrs. Smith points to a band- box containing her best bonnet, which he has just put his foot through. Smith is silent. The cartmen were to be on the premises-at six o'clock. Six o'clock comes--half-past six- seven o'clock- but no cart- men. Here is a dilemma!

Smith takes a survey of his furniture, with a feeling of in- tense disgust. He wishes his cumbrous goods were reduced to the capacity of a carpet-bag, which he could pick up and walk away with. The mirrors and pianoforte are hia especial aversion. The latter is a fine instrument, with an Eolianri at- tachment.

Smith is at a loss to know what excuse they will make. Verdant Smith!  They make no excuse. They simply tell him, with an air which demands his congratulations, that they " picked up a nice job by the way, and stopped to do it. You see," says the princi- pal, "we goes in for all we can get, these times, and there's no use of anybody's grumbling. Kase, you see, if one don't want us, another will; and it's no favor for anybody'to em. ploy us a week either side the first of May." The rascal grins, as he says this; and Smith, perceiving the strength of the cartman's position, wisely makes no reply, They begin to load.

He "can't wait there, all day, in the street." He orders his men to " carry the things into the house," and heads the column himself with a costly rocking-chair in his arms. As Brown comes up with his rocking-chair, Smith, at the head of his men, descends, with a bureau, from the second floor. "They met, 't was in a crowd"- on the stairs, and Smith "Thought that Brown would shtmUn him," -but he did n't! The consequence was, they came in collis- ion; or, rather, Smith's bureau and Brown's rocking-chair came in collision. Now, said bureau was an old-fashioned, hard- wood affair, made for service, while Brown's rocking-chair was a flimsy, showy fabric, of modem make. The meeting on the stairs occasions some squeezing, and more stumbling, and Brown suddenly finds himself and chair under the bureau, to the great injury of his person and his furniture. (Brown has since recovered, but the case of the rocking-chair is considered hopeless.) This discomfiture incenses the Browns to a high degree, and they determine to be as annoying as possible; so they persist in bringing their furniture into the house, and up stairs, as the Smiths are carrying theirs out of the house, and down stairs. Collisions are, of course, the order of the day; but the Smiths do not mind this much, as they have a great advantage, viz: their furniture is not half so good as Browz's. After a few smashes, Brown receives light on this point, and orders his forces to remain quiet, while the foe evacuates the 23b  &#xD;<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC7388-00000186"/> 354        A MOVING TALE. premises; so the Smiths retire in peace - and much of their furniture in pieces. The four carts form quite a respectable procession; but there is no disguising the fact that the furniture looks very shabby (and whose furniture does not look shabby, piled on carts?); so the Smiths prudently take a back street, that no one may accuse them of owning it. Smith has to carry the baby and a large mirror, which Mrs. S. was afraid to trust to the cartmen, there being no insurance on either. It being a windy day, both the mirror and Smith's hat veer to all points of the compass, while the baby grows very red in the face at not being able to possess himself of them. Between the wind, the mirror, his hat and the baby, Smith has an unpleasant walk of it. About ten o'clock, they arrive at their new residence, and find, to their horror, that their predecessors have not begun to move. They inquire the reason. The feminine head of the family informs them, with tears in her eyes, that her husband, (Mr. Jonas Jenkins,) has been sick in Washington for five weeks; that, in consequence of his affliction, they have not been able to provide a new tenement; that she is quite unwell, and that one of her children (she has six) is ill, also; that she don't know what is to become of them, &amp;c., &amp;c. Sfmith sets his hat on the back of his head, gives a faint tug at his neck-tie and confesses himself-quenched! His furniture looks more odious every minute. He once felt much pride in it, but he feels none now: he feels only disgust. The cartmen begin to growl out that they "can't stand here all day," and request to   A MOVING TALE.          355 be informed "where we shall drop the big traps." Hereupon, Smith ventures, with a ghastly attempt at a smile, to inquire of Mrs. Jenkins why she did n't tell him, when he called, on Saturday, of her inability to procure a house? To which that lady innocently replies that she did n't wish to give him any unnecessary trouble!" which reply satisfies him as to Mrs. Jen- kin's claim to force of intellect. At this juncture, Smith falls into a profound reverie. He thinks that, after all, Fourier is right--" that the Solidarity of the human race is an entity;" that "nobody can be happy, until everybody is happy." He agrees with the great philoso- pher, that the "series distributes the harmonies." He realizes that " society is organized (or, rather, disorganized) on a wrong basis;" that it is in an "amorphous condition," whereas it should be "crystalized." With our celebrated "down east" poet, Ethan Spike, Esq., he begins to think that, "The eternal bung is loose," and that, unless it be soon tightened, there is danger that "All nater will be spilt" He comes to the conclusion, finally, that "something must be done," and that speedily, to " secure a home for every family." At this point, he is aroused by his tormenters, the cartmen, who inform him that they are in a "Barkis" state of mind, (willin') to receive their twelve dollars. Smith pays the money, and turns to examine the premises. He finds that Mrs. Jen. kins has packed all her things in the back basement and the second-floor sitting-room. Poor thing! she has done her best,  &#xD;<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC7388-00000187"/> 356        A MOVING TAL E. after all. She is in ill health; her husband is sick, and away from home; and her children are not well. God pity the un- fortunate who live in cities, especially in the " moving season." But Smith is a kind-hearted man. With a few exceptions, the Smiths are a kind-hearted race - and that's probably the rea- son they are so numerous. Smith puts on a cheerful countenance, and busies himself in arrranging his furniture. Mrs. Smith, kind soul, forgets the destruction of her bandbox and bonnet, and cares not how long or how loud Smith whistles. Suddenly the prospect bright- ens! Mrs. Jenkins' brother-in-law appears, and announces that he has found rooms for her, a little higher up town. Cartmen are soon at the door, and the Jenkinses are on their (' winding way " to their new residence. --But the Smiths' troubles are not yet over. The painters, who were to have had the house all painted the day before, have done nothing but leave their paint-pots in the hall, and a little Smithng, being of an investigating turn of mind, and hungry, withal, attempts to make a late breakfast off the con- tents of one of them. He succeeds in eating enough to dis- gust him with his bill of fare, and frighten his mamma into hysterics. A doctor is sent for: he soon arrives, and, after attending to the mother, gives the young adventurer a facetious chuck under the chin, and pronounces him perfectly safe. The parents are greatly relieved, for Willy is a pet; and they con- fidently believe him destined to be President of the United States, if they can only keep paint-pots out of his way. It takes the Smiths some ten days to get " to rights."

Still, they are thankful for present peace, and are determined, positively, not to move again- until next May.  &#xD;<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC7388-00000188"/> THS SIDE AND THAT. I AM weary of this hollow show and glitter - weary of fash- ion's stereotyped lay-figures--weary of smirking fops and brainless belles, exchanging their small coin of flattery and their endless genuflexions: let us go out of Broadway- somewhere, anywhere. Turn round the wheel, Dame Fortune, and show up the other side. "The Tombs!" - we never thought to be there! neverthe- less, we are not to be frightened by a grated door or a stone wall, so we pass in; leaving behind the soft wind of this Indian summer day, to lift the autumn leaves as gently as does a loving nurse her drooping child. We gaze into the narrow cells, and draw a long breath. Poor creatures, tempted and tried. How many to whom the world now pays its homage, who sit in high places, should be in their stead? God knoweth. See them, with their pale faces pressed up against the grated windows, or pacing up and down their stone floors, like chained beasts. There is a little boy not more than ten years old; what has he done? "Stolen a pair of shoes!" Poor child! he never heard of "Swartout." How should he know that he was put in there not for stealing, but for do- ing it on so small a scale?   THS SIDE   AND THAT.        359 "st! Do you see that figure seated in the farther corner of that cell, with his hands crossed on his knees? His whole air and dress are those of a gentleman. How came such a man as that here? "For murder?"  How sad! Ah! somewhere in the length and breadth of the land, a mother's heart is aching because she  spared the rod to spoil the child. There is a coffin, untenanted as yet, but kept on hand; for Death laughs at bolts and fetters, and many a poor wretch is borne struggling within these gloomy walls, only to be carried to his last home, while none but God may ever know at whose fireside stands his vacant chair. And here is a woman's cell. There are two or three faded dresses hanging against the walls, and a bonnet, for which she has little use. Her friends have brought her some bits of cer- peting, which she has spread over the stone floor, with  womanly love of order, (poor thing,) to make the place k home-like. And there is a crucifix in the corner. See,  kneels before it! May the Holy Virgin's blessed Son, w. said to the sinning one, "Neither do I condemn thee," send in her stricken heart the balm of holy peace. Who is that? No! it cannot be - but, yes, it is he - ar what a wreck! See, he shrinks away, and a bright flush chases the marble paleness from his cheek. God bless me! That R-, should come to this! Still, Intemperance, with her thousand voices, crieth "Give! give!" and still, alas! it is the gifted, and generous, and warm-hearted, who oftenest answer the summons.  &#xD;<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC7388-00000189"/> 360      THS SIDE  AND  THAT. More cells -but there is no bed in them; only a wooden platform, raised over the stone floor. It is for gutter drunk- ards-too foul, too loathsome to be placed upon a bed turned in here like swine, to wallow in the same slough. Oh, how few, who, festively sipping the rosy wine, say "my moun- tain stands strong," e'er dream of such an end as this. Look there! tread softly: angels are near us. Through the grated window the light streams faintly upon a little pallet, where, sweet as a dream of heaven, lies a sleeping babe! Over its cherub face a smile is flitting. The cell has no other occu- pant; angels only watch the slumbers of the prison-cradled. The place is holy. I stoop to kiss its forehead. From the crowd of women pacing up and down the guarded gallery, one glides gently to my side, saying, half proudly, half sadly, "'Tis my babe." "It is so sweet, and pure, and holy," said I. The mother's lip quivered; wiping away a tear with her apron, she said, in a choking voice: "Ah, it is little the likes of you, ma'am, know how hard it is for us to get the honest bread!" God be thanked, thought I, that there is one who "judgeth not as man judgeth;" who holdeth evenly the scales of justice; who weigheth against our sins the whirlpool of our temptations, who foretteth never the countless struggles for the victory, ere the desponding, weary heart shuts out the light of Heaven.   MRS. ZEBEDEE SMTH'S PHLOSOPHY. DEAR me! how expensive it is to be poor. Every time I go out, my best bib and tucker has to go on. If Zebedee were worth a cool million, I might wear a coal-hod on my head, if I chose, with perfect impunity. There was that old nabob's wife at the lecture, the other night, in a dress that might have been made for Noah's great grandmother. She can afford it! Now, if it rains knives and forks, I must sport a ten dollar hat, a forty dollar dress, and a hundred dollar shawl. If I go to a concert, I must take the highest priced seat, and ride there and back, just to let "Tom, Dick and Harry" see that I can afford it. Then, we must hire the most expensive pew in the broad-aisle of a tip-top church, and give orders to the sexton not to admit any strangers into it who look snobbish. Then my little chil- dren, Napoleon Bonaparte and Donna Maria Smith, can't go to a public school, because, you know, we should n't have to pay anything. Then, if I go shopping, to buy a paper of needles, I have to get a little chap to bring them home, because it would n't an- swer for me to be seen carrying a bundle through the streets. We have to keep three servants, where one might do; and Zebedee's coats have to be sent to the tailor when they need a button sewed on, for the look of the thing.  &#xD;<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC7388-00000190"/> 332  MRS.

I have to be done up by ten o'clock in a Swiss-muslin dress, and a French cap; and my Napoleon Bonaparte and Donna Maria can't go off the piazza, because the big rocks and little pebbles cut their toes so badly through their patent kid slippers. Then, if Zebedee goes a fishing, he dare not put on a linen coat, for the price of his reputation. No, indeed! Why, he never goes to the barn-yard without drawing on his white kids. Then he orders the most ruinous wines at dinner, and fees those white jackets, till his purse is as empty as an egg- shell I declare, it is abominably expensive. I don't believe rich people have the least idea how much it costs poor people to live!   OPENING OF THE CRYSTAL PALACE. SUCH a crowd, such a rush, such a confusion I never expect to see again. Equestrians and pedestrians; omnibuses and- carriages; soldiers, civilians and unciviLians; carts and curri- cles; city exquisites, and country nondescripts; men on the rtin; women tiptoe-ing, with all sails spread; papas in a put- ter; fat men sweltering; lean men, with tempers as sharp as their bones, ruthlessly pushing through the crowd; musicians perspiring in tuneful agony; thermometer evidently on a spree; shirt-collars prostrate; dust everywhere; police nowhere; ev- erybody in somebody's way;-- whizz - buzz - rattle - bang - crash - smash; "Oh dear! where's Pa?" - "Sarah Ma- ria, take care of your flounces." Get out of the way, can't you?" -"Take your cane out of my eye, will you?" -"Mr. Jones, just see the way that baby's best bonnet is jammed!" "-( Hurry!" -" I can't hurry; somebody has trod on my skirt, and burst off the hooks; so much for not letting me wear Bloomers! What a figure I cut, to appear before the President, and no chance to apologize, Mr. Jones!" -Well; it's eleven o'clock, and after several abortive at- tempts, we succeed in arresting an omnibus, labelled " for the Hippodrome and Crystal Palace."

Broadway is lined, on either side, with a dense throng of questionable looking expectants, waiting "tl;o see the proces- sion." Short people are at a discount; no chance for the poor wretches, strain and tiptoe it as they will. One tall man, who evidently knew the worth of his inches, seemed to think him- self too valuable to be let out all at once; so, he elevated him- self, jack-screw fashion, letting out one link of his vertebral col- umn after another, until he towered above his neighbors like a pine tree among scrub oaks. What altitude he finallv reached, I am unable to say, as he was still on his way up dike Jack's bean-stalk) when our omnibus passed him. "Everything comes in use once in seven years," says the old proverb. I had often wondered of what earthly use could be the tottering brick-piles, which disfigure every block in Broad- way. Today, I was enlightened; they served admirably as points of observation for the more adventurous spectators, and each pile was covered with eager gazers. The windows over- looking Broadway were all filled with neatly dressed ladies, and as the eye swept through this magnificent thoroughfare, the rush- ing vehicles, the swaying, motley multitudes, the gaily dressed ladies, the waving flags and banners which floated over the more public and prominent edifices, presented'an ever varying pano- rama, that was far from being the least attractive and impres. sive feature of the day. I have often thought when the people come out " to see a sight," that they themselves are far more imposing than what they came to see. On entering the Palace, we (my companion and I) found   OPENING. OF CRYSTAL PALACE.         365 that all the most eligible seats were already occupied, and that what were left were reserved for some man of straw and his wife. It was no use to show one's ticket. "-You must n't sit here!"-  You must nt sit there!"--"You can't stand in that place!"--"You can't go there!"-"You can't come here!"-and so the throng went forlornly about and around- old men and maidens-heads of families-clergymen-ele- gant ladies--all sorts of people-seeking places whereon they might rest, and finding none. We finally resolved on action, seized a couple of boxes of workmen's tools, emptied the con- tents on the floor, and converted the boxes into comfortable seats, in the most commanding position in the eastern gallery, notwithstanding the impertinent expostulations of the rosetted officers. Above us was the lofty stained dome, a most imposing fea- ture;- flags of all nations waved from the latticed balconies; beneath, the jeweled arms of ladies fair gleamed and flashed in the sunlight. Directly below us was Marochetti's equestrian statue of Washington, of colossal proportions. Years ago, dear general, you rode into my young affections on that very horse, as represented on a ninepennly printed cotton handkerchief, given me as a " reward of merit" for correctly " declining to love" (I wish I had always declined it!) In the immediate neighbor- hood, our eye rested on a gigantic statue of Webster. There were his features, certainly, all correct, by line and plummet; but where's the expression? It was soulless and corpse-like -it failed to magnetize me. Arn hour has pawed ; our eyes are weary with gazing; still,  &#xD;<pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC7388-00000192"/> 366   OPENING OF CRYSTAL PALACE. no President. The singers have taken their places--the organ lhas emitted one or two premonitory subterranean grumbles, and the platform is beginning to fill with lesser dignitaries. The richly-cushioned Presidential chair, has been wheeled about in the most inviting locality; a huge bouquet is placed under it by way of bait, but still the President doesn't nibble! So we bide our time with what patience we may-though the thought of a glass of ice-water, or a cake, occasionally quenches our patience and patriotism. Another hour has passed! Even feminine curiosity cannot exist much longer on such unsubstantial aliment as pontifical robes and empty glitter. My companion is certainly a wizard! He has conjured up some ice cream and cake:--now I shall have strength to cheer the President. Here he comes, God bless him! You won't see a sight like that out of America. The representative of a mighty nation-one of the mightiest on earth-receiving the homage of expectant thousands, stand- ing without " star " or " order," or insignia of power, other than that with which the Almighty has stamped him. No '" body. guard," no hedging him in from the people. It is sublime! -Now the Bishop reads an eloquent prayer; then follows an ode, sung to the time-honored tune of Old Hundred, echo- ing from hundreds of voices, through those deep naves, with such thrilling majesty that you feel as if wings were growing from out your shoulders, and you must soar; and suggesting the song of the redeemed, sung by thousands and tens of thou- sands, before the great White Throne.

Some day, when the President is not present to eclipse them, I shall return and examine all the chef de'oeuvres of art here collected. -Stay! here 's a pretty conceit I must look at, as we pass along out--a mock garden of moss and flowers, about the size of a lady's work table, from the center of which plays a foun- tain of eau de cologne, beneath whose drops any lady can per- fume her kerchief en passant, a dainty invention for a boudoir. Need I say its birth-place is Paris. There's the statue of the Amazonian Queen, startled by the sudden spring of a tiger at her horse's throat. Hartshorn and smelling salts, it 's alive --no; it is lifeless bronze, but so full of vitality and expression, it makes me shiver to look at it. Now my eye is arrested by an imposing group of Thor- walsden, "Christ and his Apostles." It is not my Christ. It :s not He who said, 1"Suffer little children to come unto me." It is not He who said to the weeping Magdalen, "Neither do I condemn thee." It is not He who raised for the meek Mary, the dead Lazarus. It is not He who, dying, cried, "Father, forgive them; they know not what they do." It is a form, stern, unbending, forbidding. My heart refuses its allegiance. But I fear I am wearying the reader; so, let me close by saying, that what astonished me more than anything else, was the appearance of four of the most consummate Knaves in the world. They occupied conspicuous positions during the public exercises, and in fact, all the time I was there. Indeed, I am  &#xD;<pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC7388-00000193"/> 368   OPENING OF CRYSTAL PALACE. informed that they have been in regular attendance ever since the Palace was opened, notwithstanding they are well known, not only to the police, but to the officers of the exhibition. It is even whispered that the latter named gentlemen connive at their attendance, unblushingly bestow many attentions upon them, and will, undoubtedly, permit them to be present during the entire exhibition. That the public may know and recog- nize them, I will give their names: they are the North Nave, the South Nave, the East Nave, and the West Nave!   A LANCE COUCHED FOR THE CHLDREN. You have a pretty, attractive child; she is warm-hearted and afrectionate but vivacious and full of life. With judicious man- agement, and a firm, steady rein, she is a very lovable one. You take her with you on a visit, or to make a call. You are busy, talking with the friend you went to see. A gentleman comes in and throws himself indolently on the sofa. His eye falls upon little Kitty. He is just in the mood to be amused, and makes up his mind to banter her a little, for the sake of drawing her out. So he says-  "Jemima, dear - come here!" The child blushes, and regards him as if uncertain whether he intended to address her. He repeats his request, with a laugh. She replies, " my name is Kitty, not Jemima," which her tormentor contradicts. Kitty looks puzzled, (just as he in- tended she should,) but it is only for a moment. She sees he is quizzing her. Well, Miss Kitty likes a frolic, ifthat is what he wants; so she gives him a pert answer--he laughs uproar- iously, and rattles fun round her little ears like a hail storm; Kitty has plenty of answers ready for him, and he enjoys the sport amazingly. By-and-by, he gets weary, and says,-"There-run away 24b  &#xD;<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC7388-00000194"/> 370    A LANCE COUCHED FOR CHLDREN. now, I'm going to read the newspaper;" but Kitty is wide awake, and has no idea of being cut short in that, summary way; so she continues her Lilliputian attacks, till finally he gets up and beats a despairing retreat, muttering, " what a very dis. agreeable child." Mamma sees it all from a distance; she does not interfere -no-for she believes in "Children's Rights." Kitty was quiet, well behaved and respectful--till the visitor undertook to quiz, and tease her, for his own amusement. He wanted a frolic - and he has had it: they who play with children must take children's play.   A CHAPTER ON HOUSEKEEPI-NG. I NEVER could see the reason why your smart housekeepers must, of necessity, be Xantippes. I once had the misfortune to be domesticated during the summer months with one of this genus. I should like to have seen the adventurous spider that would have dared to ply his cunning trade in Mrs. Carrot s premises! Nobody was allowed to sleep a wink after daylight, beneath her roof. Even her old rooster crowed one hour earlier than any of her neighbors'. "Go ahead," was written on every broomstick in the establishment. She gave her husband his breakfast, buttoned up his over- coat, and put him out of the front door, with his face in the di- rection of the store, in less time than I've taken to tell it. Then she snatched up the six little Carrots; scrubbed their faces, up and down, without regard to feelings or noses, till they shone like a row of milk pans. "Clear the track"was her mnoto, washing and ironing days. She never drew a long breath till the wash-tubs were turned bottom upwards again, and every article of wearing apparel sprinkled, folded, ironed, and replaced on the backs of their 'respective owners. It gave me a stitch in the side to look at her!  &#xD;<pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC7388-00000195"/> 372   A CHAPTER ON HOVSEKEEPINGo As to her "cleaning days," I never had courage to witness one. I used to lie under an apple tree in the orchard, till she was through. A whole platoon of soldiers would n't have frightened me so much as that virago and her mop. You should have seen her in her glory on " baking days;," her sleeves rolled up to her arm-pits, and a long, check apron swathed around her bolster-like figure. The great oven glow- ing, blazing, and sparkling, in a manner very suggestive, to a lazy sinner, like myself. The interminable rows of greased pie- plates; the pans of rough and ready gingerbread; the pots of pork and beans, in an edifying state of progression; and the immense embryo loaves of brown and wheaten bread. To my innocent inquiry, whether she thought the latter would " rise," she set her skinny arms akimbo, marched up within kissing distance of my face, cocked her head on'one side, and asked if I thought she looked like a woman to be trifled with by a loaf of bread!" The way I settled down into my slippers, with- out a reply, probably convinced her that I was no longer skep. tical on that point. Saturday evening she employed in winding up everything that was unwound in the house - the old entry clock included. From that time till Monday morning, she devoted to her hus. band and Sabbatical exercises. All I have to say is, it is to be hoped she carried some of the fervor of her secular employ. ments into those halcyon hours.   BARNUM'S MUSEUM. IT is possible that every stranger may suppose, as I did, on first approaching Barnum's Museum, that the greater part of its curiosities are on the outside, and have some fears that its internal will not equal its external appearance. But, after cross- ing the threshold, he will soon discover his mitake. The first idea suggested will perhaps be that the view, from the windows, of the motley, moving throng in Broadway--the rattling, thundering carts, carriages and omnibuses--the confluence of the vehicular and human tides which, from so many quarters, come pouring past the museum - is, (to adopt the language of advertisements,) " worth double the price of admission." The visitor's attention will unquestionably be next arrested by the "Bearded Lady of Switzerland "-one of the most curious curiosities ever presented. A card, in pleasant juxta- position to the lady," conveys the gratifying intelligence that, "Visitors are allowed to touch the beard." Not a man in the throng lifts an investigating finger! - Your penetration, Madame Clofullia, does you infinite credit. You knew well enough that your permission would be as good as a handcuff to every pair of masculine wrists in the company. For my own part, I should no more meddle with your beard, than with Mons.

I am glad you raised it, however, just to show Barnum that there is something "new under the sun," and to convince men in general that a woman can accomplish about anything she undertakes. I have not come to New York to stifle my inquisitiveness. How did you raise that beard? Who shaves first in the morn- ing? you, or your husband? Do you use a Woman's Rights razor? Which of you does the strapping? How does your baby know you from its father? What do you think of us, smooth-faced sisters? Do you (between you and me) prefer to patronize dress-makers, or tailors? Do you sing tenor, or alto? Are you master, or mistress of your husband's affec- tions? - Well, at all events, it has been something in your neu- tral pocket to have "tarried at Jericho till your beard was grown." --What have we here?

Mutual vows of friendship had evidently been exchanged  and rat-ified bythese natural enemies.

A FERN REVERIE. DEAR me, I must go shopping. Shopping is a nuisance: clerks are impertinent: feminity is victimized. Miserable day, too : mud plastered an inch thick on the side walk. Well, if we drop our skirts, gentlemen cry "Ugh!" and if we lift them from the mud, they level their eye-glasses at our ankles. The true definition of a gentleman (not found in incomplete Web- ster) is--a biped, who, of a muddy day, is perfectly oblivious of anything but the shop signs. Vive la France 1 Ingenious Parisians., send us over your clever invention---a chain suspended from the girdle, at the end of which is a gold hand to clasp up the superfluous length of our promenading robes, thus releasing our human digits, and leaving them at liberty to wrestle with rude Boreas for the possession of the detestable little sham bonnets, which the mil- liners persist in hanging on the backs of our necks. Well, here we are at Call &amp; Ketchum's dry-goods store. Now comes the tug of war: let Job's mantle fill on my femi- nine shoulders. "Have you blue silk .

Here's Mr. Timothy Tape's establishment. "Have you lace collars, (in points,) Mr. Tape?" Mr. Tape looks beneficent, and shows me some rounded col- lars. I repeat my request. in the most pointed manner for pointed collars. Mr. Tape replies, with a patronizing grin: "Points is going out, Ma'am." "So am I." Dear me, how tired my feet are! nevertheless, I must have some merino. So I open the door of Mr. Henry Humbug's dry-goods store, which is about half a mile in length, and in- quire for the desired article. Young Yardstick directs me to the counter, at the extreme end of the store. I commence my travels thitherward through a file of gaping clerks, and arrive there just ten minutes before two, by my repeater; when I am told " they are quite out of merinos; but won't Lyonnese cloth do just as well?" pulling down a pile of the same. I rush out in a high state of fienzy, and, taking refuge in the next-door neighbor's, inquire for some stockings. Whereupon the clerk inquires (of the wrong customer,) "What price I wish to pay?" Of course, I am not so verdant as to be caught in that trap; and, teetotally disgusted with the entire institution of shopping, I drag my  weary limbs into Taylor's new saloon, to rest.

"THERE is no better test of moral excellence, than the keenness of one's sense, and -he depth of one's love, of all that is beautiful.".-Dow^oht. I DO N'T endorse that sentiment. I am acquainted with Apollo Hyacinth. I have read his prose, and I have read his poetry; and I have cried over both, till my heart was as soft as my head, and my eyes were as red as a rabbit's. I have listened to him in public, when he was, by turns, witty, sparkling, sa- tirical, pathetic, till I could- have added a codicil to my will, and ilft him  all my worldly poasessions; and possibly you have done the same. He has, perhaps, grasped you cordially by the hand, and, with a beaming smile, urged you, in his mu- sical voice, to "call on him and Mrs. Hyacinth " and you have called: but, did you ever find him "in?"You have in- vited him to visit you, and have received a 'gratified accept. ance," in his elegant chirography; but, did he ever come?  He has borrowed money of you in the most elegant manner possi- ble; and, as he deposited it in his beautiful purse, he has a&amp; sured you, in the choicest and most happily chosen language, that he " should never forget your kindness; " but, did he ever pay? Should you die to-morrow, Apollo would write a poetical  &#xD;<pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC7388-00000200"/> 382       APOLLO HYACINTH. obituary notice of you, which would raise the price of pocket- handkerchiefs; but should your widow call on him in the course of a month, to solicit his patronage to open a school, she would be told "he was out of town," and that it was "quite uncertain when he would return." Apollo has a large circle of relatives; but his " keenness of perception, and deep love, of the beautiful" are so great, that none of them exactly meet his views. His " moral excellence," however, does not prevent his making the most of them. He has a way of dodging them adroitly, when they call for a re- ciprocation, either in a business or a social way; or, if, at any time, there is a necessity for inviting them to his house, he does it when he is at his country residence, where their greenness will not be out of place. Apollo never says an uncivil thing- never; he prides him self on that, as well as on his perfect knowledge of human na- ture; therefore, his sins are all sins of omission. His tastes are very exquisite, and his nature peculiarly sensitive; consequent- ly, he cannot bear trouble. He will tell you, in his elegant way, that trouble " annoys" him, that it "bores" him; in short, that it unfits him for life-- for business g so, should you hear that a friend or relative of his, even a brother or a sister, was in distress, or persecuted in any manner, you could not do Apollo a greater injury (in his estimation) than to inform him of the fsct. It would so grate upon his sensitive spirit, --it would so " annoy" him; whereas, did he not hear of it until the friend, or brother, or sister, were relieved or buried, he could manage the matter with his usual urbanity and without   APOLLO HYACINTH.          383 the slightest draught upon his exquisitely sensitive nature, by simply writing a pathetic and elegant note, expressing the keen- est regret at not having known " all about it" in time to have "flown to the assistance of his dear" &amp;c. Apollo prefers friends who can stand grief and annoyance, as a rhinoceros can stand flies-- friends who can bear their own troubles and all his friends who will stand between him and everything disagreeable in life, and never ask anything in re- turn. To such friends he clings with the most touching tena- city- as long as he can use them; but let their good name be assailed, let misfortune once overtake them, and his ,' moral exoellence" compels him, at once, to ignore their existence, until they have been extricated from all their troubles, and it has become perfectly safe and advantageous for him to renew the acquaintance. Apollo is keenly alive to the advantages of social position, (not having always enjoyed them;) and so, his Litany reads after this wise: From all questionable, unfashionable, unpre- sentable, and vulgar persons, Good Lord, deliver us!  &#xD;<pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC7388-00000201"/> SPOILED LITTLE BOY.

One must woe al this, before he can form a just idea of the magnitude and importance of the work that Mr. Pease has sin- gle-handed and nobly undertaken; remembering that men of wealth and influence have their own reasons for using that wealth and influence to perpetuate this modem Sodom. One should spend an hour in Mr. Pease's house, to see the constant drafts upon his time and strength, in the shape of calls and messages, and especially the applications for relief that his slender purse alas! is often not able to answer;-he should see his unwearied patience and activity, admire the kind, sym- pathetic heart-unaffected by the toil or the frowns of tempo- rizing theorists-ever warm, ever pitiful, giving not only " the crumbs from his table," but often his own meals to the hungry-his own wardrobe to the naked;-he should see this, and go away ashamed to have lived so long and done so little to help the maimed, and sick, and lame, to Bethesdas Pool. I will relate an incident which occurred, some time since, at the House of Industry, and which serves as a fair sample of daily occurrences there. One morning an aged lady, of respectable appearance, called at the Mission House and enquired for Mr. Pease. She was told that he was engaged, and asked if some one else would not l   . -/  &#xD;<pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC7388-00000204"/> 390   FIVE POINTS HOUSE OF INDUSTRY, do as well. She said, respectfully, "No; my business is with him; I will wait, if you please, till he can see me." Mr. Pease immediately came in, when the old lady cor. menced her story: "I came, sir," said she, "in behalf of a poor, unfortunate woman and three little children. She is living now"--and the tears dropped over her wrinkled face-- "in a bad place in Willetstreet, in a basement. There are rum shops all around it, and many drunken people about the neighborhood. She has made out to pay the rent, but has had no food for the poor little children, who have subsisted on what they could manage to beg in the day time. The landlord promised, when she hired the basement, to put a lock on the door, and make it comfortable, so that 'the Croton' need not run in; but he got his rent and then broke his promise, and they have not seen him since." "Is the woman respectable?" enquired Mr. Pease. "Yes-no-not exactly," said the poor old lady, violently agitated.  "She was wel brought up. She has a good heart, sir, but a bad head, and then trouble has discouraged her. Poor Mary'-yes sir, it must have been the trouble--for I know her heart is good, sir. I "- tears choked the old lady's utternce.  Recovering herself, she continued: "She had a kind husband once. He was the father of her two little girls: six years ago he died, and-the poor thing- oh, sir, you don't know how dear she is to me!" and burying her aged face in her hands, she sobbed aloud. Mr. Pease' kind heart interpreted the old lady's emotion,   FIVE POINTS HOUSE OF INDUSTRY.       391 without the pain of an explanation. In the weeping woman be- fore him he saw the mother of the lost one. Yes, she was "Mary's" mother. Poverty could not chill her love; 'hame and the world's scorn had only filled her with a God-like pity. After a brief pause, she brushed away her tears and went on: "Yes, sir; Mary was a good child to me once; she respect- ed religion and religious people, and used to love to go to church, but lately, sir, God knows she has almost broke my heart. Last spring I took her-home, and the three dear chil. dren; but she would not listen to me, and left without telling me where she was going. I heard that there was a poor woman living in a basement in Willet street, with three chil- dren, and my heart told me that that was my poor, lost Mary, and there I found her. But, oh, sir -oh, sir "- and she sob- bed as if her heart were breaking--" such a place'!

She was getting so agitated that Mr. Pease, wishing to turn the current of her thoughts, asked her if she herself was a member of any church. She said yes, of the --- street Baptist Church. She said -she was a widow, and had had one child beside Mary--a son. And her face lighted up as she said: "Oh sir, he was such a fine lad. He did all he could to make me happy; but he thought, that if he went to California he could make money, and when he left he said ' Cheer up, dear  &#xD;<pb n="392-393" xml:id="VAC7388-00000205"/> 392   FIVE POINTS HOUSE OF INDUSTRY. mother; I'll come back and give my money all to you, and you shall never work any more.' " "I can see him now, sir, as he stood there, with his eye kin- dling. Poor lad! poor lad! He came back, but it was only to die. His last words were, 'God will care for you, mother- I know it - when I 'm gone to Heaven. Oh! if I could have seen my poor girl die as he did, before she became so bad. Oh, sir, won't you take her here?- won't you try to make her good?.- can't you make her good, sir? I can't give Mary up. Nobody cares for Mary now but me. Won't you try, sir?" Mr. Pease promised that he would do all he could, and sent a person out with the old lady, to visit "Mary," and obtain particulars: he soon returned and corroborated all the old la- dy's statements. Mr. Pease then took a friend and started to see what could be done. In Willet street is a rickety old wooden building, filled to overflowing with the very refuse of humanity. The basement is lighted with two smal windows half under ground; and in this wretched hole lived Mary and her children. As Mr. Pease descended the steps into the room, he heard some one say, "Here he comes, grandmother! he's come - he's come!" The door was opened  On a pile of rags in the comer lay Mary, " my Mary," as the old lady tearfully called her. God of mercy! what a wreck of beautiful womanhood! Her large blue eyes glared with maniac wildness, under the in. fluence of intoxication. Long waves of auburn hair fell, in tan- gled masses, over a form wasted, yet beautiful in its graceful outlines.   FPIVE POINTS HOUSE OF INDUSTRY.       393 Poor, lost Mary! "Such a place!" as her mother had, weeping, said. Not a table, or chair, or bedstead, or article of furniture in it, of any description. On the mantlepiece stood a beer-bottle with a half burnt candle in: its nose. A few broken, dirty dishes stood upon the shelf, and a quantity of filthy rags lay scattered round the floor. The grandmother was holding by the hand a sweet child of eight years, with large, bright eyes, and auburn hair dike poor Mary's) falling about her neck. An older girl of twelve, with a sweet, Madonna face, that seemed to light up even that wretched place with a beam of Heaven, stood near, bearing in her arms a babe of sixteen months, which was not so large as one of eight months should have been. Its little hands looked like bird's claws, and its little bones seemed almost piercing the skin.- The old lady went up to her daughter, saying, "Mary, dear, this is the gentleman who is willing to take you to his house, if you will try to be good." "Get out of the room, you old hypocrite," snarled the in. toxicated woman, "or I'll---- and she clutched a hatchet beside her)-I 'll show you! You are the worst old woman I ever knew, except the one you brought in- here the other day, and she is a fiend outright. Talk to me about being good!- ha - ha "-and she laughed an idiot laugh.

"Yes, dear mother, chimed in the younger sister, bending her little curly head over her, "mother, you said once you would go. Do n't keep us here any longer, mother. We are cold and hungry. Please get up and take us away; we are afraid to stay here, mother, dear," Yes, Mary," said the old lady, handing her down a faded, ragged gown, " here is your dress; put it on, wont you!" Mary raised herself on the pile of rags on which she was ly- ing, and pushing the eldest girl across the room, screamed out, "Get away, you impudent little thing! you are just like your old grandmother. I tell you all," said she, raising herself on one elbow, and tossing back her auburn hair from her broad, white forehead, "I tell you all, I never will go from here, never! I love this place. So many fine people come here, and we have such good times. There is a gentleman who takes care of me. He brought me some candles, last night, and he says that I shan't want for anything, if I will only get rid of these trouble- some children-my husband's children." And she hid her faice in her hands and laughed convulsively. "You may have them," she continued, "just as soon as you like-baby and all! but I never will go from this plaet. I love it. A great many fine people come here to see me." The poor old lady wrung her hands and wept, while the chil- drnn clung round their grandmother, with half-averted faces, trembling and silent. Mr. Pease said to her, "Mary, you may either go with me,   FIVE POINTS HOUSE OF INDUSTRY.        895 or rll send for an officer and have you carried to the station. house. Which will you do!" Mary cursed and raved, but finally put on the dress the old lady handed her, and consented to go with them. A carriage was soon procured, and Mary helped inside- Mr. Pease lift- ing in the baby and the two little girls, and away they started for the Five Points House of Industry. "Oh, mother!" exclaimed the younger of the girls, "how very pleasant it is to ride in this nice carriage, and to get away from that dirty place; we shall be so happy now, mother; and Edith and the baby too: see, he is laughing: he likes to ride. You will love sister Edith and baby, and me, now, wont you, dear mother? and you wont frighten us with the hatchet any more, or hurt dear grandmother, will you?" Arriving at Mr. Pease's house, the delight of the little crea- tures was unbounded. They caught hold of their mother's fa- ded dress, saying, "Did n't we tell you, mother, that you would have a pleasant home here?

We d play hide and seek, in the hollow trunks of old trees; we'd turn away from the gaudy flowers, flaunting their showy beauty in our fices, and search, under the glossy leaves at our feet, for the pale-eyed blossoms which nestle there as lovingly as a timid little fledgling under the mother-bird's wing; we 'd go to the lake, and see the sober, staid old cows stand cooling their legs in the water, and admiring themselves in the broad, sheeted mirror beneath; we 'd toss little pebbles in the lake, -and see the circles they made, widen and widen toward the distant shore--like careless words, dropped and forgot ten, but reaching to the far-off shore of eternity. And then you should nestle 'round me, telling all your lit- tle griefs; for well I know that childhood has its griefs, which are all the keener because great, wise, grown-up people have often neither time nor patience, amid the bustling whirl of life, 'to stop and listen to them. I know what it is for a timid little child' who has never been away from its mother's apron string, to be walked, some morning, into a great big school-room, full   FOR LITTLE OHLDREN.         399 of strange faces;--to see a little urchin laugh, and feel a choking lump come in your little throat, for fear he was laughing at you; -to stand up, with trembling legs, in the middle of the floor, and be told to "find big A," when your eyes were so full of tears that you could n't see anything;--to keep looking at the ferule on the desk, and wondering if it would ever come down on your hand; - to have some mischievous little scholar break your nice long slate-pencil in two, to plague you, or steal your bit of gingerbread, out of your satchel, and eat it up, or trip you down on purpose, and feel how little the hard-hearted young sinners cared when you sobbed out, "I 'II tell my mother." I know what it is, when you have lain every night since you. were born, with your hand clasped in your mother's, and your cheek cuddled up to hers, to see a new baby come and take your place, without even asking your leave; - to see papa, and grandpa, and grandma, and uncle, and aunt, and cousins, and all the neighbors, so glad to see it, when your heart was almost broke about it. I know what it is to have a great fat nurse (whom even mamma herself had to mind) lead you, strug- gling, out of the room, and tell Sally to see that you did n't come into your own mamma's room again all that day. I know what it is to have that fat old nurse sit in mamma's place at table, and cut up your potato and meat all wrong;-tt have her put squash on your plate, when you hate squash;-- to have her forget (.) to give you a piece of pie, and eat two pieces herself;-to have Sally cross, and Betty cross, and everybody telling you to " get out of the way;" to have your doll's leg get loose, and nobody there to hitch it on for  &#xD;<pb n="400-401" xml:id="VAC7388-00000209"/> 400      FOR LITTLE OHLDREX. you;-and then, when it came night, to be put away in a chamber, all alone by yourself to sleep, and have Sally tell you that "if you wasn't good an old black man would come and carry you off;"--and then to cuddle down under the sheet, till you were half stifled, and tremble every time the wind blew, as if you had an ague fit. Yes, and when, at last, mamma came down stairs, I know how long it took for you to like that new baby ;-how every time you wanted to sit in mamma's lap, he'd be sure to have the stomach-ache, or to want his break- fst; how he was always wanting something, so that mamma could n't tell you pretty stories, or build little blocks of houses for you, or make you reins to play horse with; or do any of those nice little things, that she used to be always doing for you. To be sure, my little darlings, I know all about it. I have cried tears enough to float a steamship, about all these provo. king things; and now whenever I see a little child cry, I never feel like laughing at him: for I know that often his little heart is just ready to break, for somebody to pet him. So I always say a kind word, or give him a pat on the head, or a kiss; for I know that though the little insect has but one grain to carry, he often staggers under it: and I have seen the time when a find word, or a beaming smile, would have been worth more to me, than all the broad lands of merrie England.   &#xD;</p>
