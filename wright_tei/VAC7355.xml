Quench, ye types, your feeble ray, Shadows, ye may melt away I Prophecy, your work is done; Gospel ages have begun I ALTAR STONES. WELL, my child, are you ready? Have you forgotten that divine service is to be held to-day in our synagogue, and that it is near the hour?" inquired Reuben Hammet, the Jew, as he entered his superbly furnished drawing- room, and thus accosted his beautiful daughter, a tall and graceful girl, apparently about seventeen years of age. "No, father, I have not forgotten, but thought the storm too severe for you to venture forth," replied Naomi, casting. a glance as she spoke towards the window, against which, snow mingled with hail had been pattering for the last few moments. "The carriage is waiting, and youth should not be daunted by a little snow, if age meets it with indifference,"' replied Mr. Hamnmet, returning the bright, sunny smile of his daugh- ter, as he watched, with all an exacting father's pride, her ready compliance with his slightest wish, and gazed upon the queenly grace and beauty of every movement, as she proceeded to throw over her shoulders a costly velvet man- tle, and to fasten around her neck a rich sable victorine. "It is fortunate my child, that you do not, like your 3  &#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC7355-00000004"/> 4         INTO THE LIGHT. mother, suffer from the headache, that convenient refuge and excuse for all delicate women when disinclined to exertion; they have the headache forsooth, and of course everything else must give way while it lasts," continued Mr. Hammet, with a slight sneer. "But mother really has the headache," replied the young girl, gently, " and cares much more than I, indeed, when obliged to remain at home. There is something lacking in^/ our worship, but what it is I cannot say, only that at times it is so obscure, so unsatisfying." "What words of doubt and unbelief are these, my daugh- ter!" exclaimed the Israelite, in profound astonishment. "From my earliest youth, I I ave received, without question- ing, all that our law holds sacred, and I trust that no falling away from the truth declared by our fathers will take place in my descendants." "No, father, you need not fear that, I think; but my nature often craves more light than I receive from the Tal- mud and the oral law. I cannot assent blindly to all I hear; still I believe our religion to be the only true one, and sup- pose that the fault is mine that I do not always see so clearly as I would wish. I will listen to-day more attentively, and it may be more understandingly." Ben, the servant, entered at that moment, with his mas- ter's fur-lined overcoat, which Naomi took from his hand, and, as she assisted her father in drawing it on, she said, - "Our race, father, do not put on and take off their faith like a garment, as do some Christians. I have heard of their changing what they call denominations more than once in the course of a lifetime." ,. Yes," replied her father, " and it is the strict and faithful adherence of the Jews to their own peculiar belief, of which Christians so much complain. Never let anything weaken your confidence, my daughter, in the sublime teachings of our most holy faith." Naomi made no reply ; but, taking out her diamond-studdled   INTO THE LIGHT.          5 watch, announced the hour, and, a few minutes after, they were seated in their plain but handsome carriage, driving rapidly towards the temple where the fair Hebrew maiden and her parents went weekly to worship. Reuben Hammet and his wife Rachel were zealous in their faith, and usually punctual in their attendance upon the forms and ceremonies of Jewish devotion; but the fine intellect of their daughter led her sometimes to doubt those forms, and question what they considered infallible. Her childhood had been passed in the midst of opulence and ease ; but her naturally sweet disposition seemed to be proof against all those influences which often make the indulged child indolent, and selfishy regardless of the happiness of others. There was a softness slumbering in her large, dreamy eyes, a sweetness playing around the corners of her beautifully formed mouth, and a serenity resting upon her fair, open brow, which proved that the golden days of youth were yet unshadowed by a single sorrow; that the stars of hope and joy were still brightly shining in the clear heavien  of her pure, young heart. Fairest among the dark-eyed daughters of the land, the young Jewess possessed no personal vanity, or pride of sta- tion; but her winning, unaffected gentleness of manner at- tracted all hearts. With an industry remarkable in one whose every fancy was gratified, she had become acquainted with all that was highest and best in English literature. Having advantage of the first masters, she had selected and appropriated the pure coin of thought and sentiment, naturally rejecting the false tinsel of superficial acquirements. She was indeed a lovely scion of a despised race! As the carriage stopped before the synagogue, the young girl observed a gentleman evidently a stranger-- standing in the vestibule, gazing with an air of interest upon the quaint carving which ornamented the heavy sidle doors. He was distinguished in his personal appearance, was above the 1*  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7355-00000005"/> 6        INTO THE LIGHT. middle height, with a figure finely proportioned. EIis pale, oval face and clearly cut features, his high, broad forehead, surmounted by dark, wavy brown hair, and thick, closely curling beard, might have entitled him to a place among the Hebrew brethren; but she knew instinctively that he did not belong to her nation, and was suddenly aroused from a gaze upon the profile of his face, which seemed to strangely absorb and fascinate her, by seeing him start forward, and in another moment a strong, powerful arm was supporting her father, who had slipped upon the ice in leaving the last step of the carriage, and, but for the timely interference of the stranger, who received him as he fell, would have been seriously injured. Casting a glance of irrepressible but respectful admiration upon Naomi, he was leaving with a low bow and a hasty "Thank ye, young man!" from Mr. Hammet, when a half- suppressed exclamation from his daughter caused the old gentleman to look again, and being pleased with the courteous and manly bearing of his young preserver, he said with more politeness, "Naomi, child, hast thou not a card?"He did not observe her bright blush and momentary embarrassment as she handed heir address to the delighted stranger, who simply bowed his thanks, lingered a moment until the gallery door closed upon the sweet vision of young and blooming girlhood that had dawned so suddenly upon him that he had felt for the moment as if within a charmed circle, and then left the building eagoer to gaze unobserved upon the name of her, who had so enthralled his fancy. "Naomi Hammet, F---- Square," was traced in fairy characters upon the card. "Naomi! Naomi!" he repeated again and again until it seemed a name known and cherished from childhood. Horace Vincent had not proceeded far when, moved by a new impulse, be retraced his steps and reached the synagogue just before the door was closed and locked, preparatory to reading the law. He looked around-Jaim as he entered with   INTO THE LIGHT.          7 a feeling of sadness mingled with admiration as he observed in the higher seats of the temple more than one venerable man wearing the mantle, or fringed insignia of past Jewish royalty and splendor upon his shoulders, and strips of parchment, called phylacteries, bound upon the forehead, inscribed with some passage of Scripture, " to remind the wearer to fulfil the law with the head and the heart," and knew that the once piercing, fiery glance of the Jew had grown dim, and his dark, flowing beard whitened by the frosts of age, while wearily and fruitlessly waiting for the coming of Israel's King. Then his eye wandered to where - bending from the latticed galleries as eager, earnest listeners to the truth - sat a bevy of young girls, whose dark oriental beauty was so unlike the blondes of the Gentile world, that for the moment Horace Vincent forgot his immediate sur- roundings and imagined himself far away where, -- "Wild Judea stretches far her silver-mantled plains," among the bright-eyed daughters of the Syrian land, the land he loved so much to read about, - the sacred soil his feet had longed to tread. There sat one, he thought, who might represent Miriam of old, so beautifully rounded was the arm that had escaped from the ermine robe she wore, so lofty and impassioned was her upward glance, when the speaker pictured in glowing colors the '"New Jerusalem that would one day descdnd out of heaven, adorned as a bride for her husband." Another might have represented Rebecca, so sweet and gentle was her expression, so modest her whole demeanor, so long the dark lashes that fringed her downcast lids, that veiled eyes which had drooped before his casual glance with a proud humility that spoke in every movement of the jew- elled, slender hand that daintily turned the leaves of the les- son-book, with a slightly coquettish air, as she again cast a furtive, sidelong look towards the handsome stranger, and observed that his whole attention was concentrated upon one  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7355-00000006"/> 8        INTO THE LIGHT. whom she herself acknowledged stood peerless among them all for youthful grace and beauty. Horace Vincent scarce heard the Hebrew melodies that floated around him, so absorbed was he in noting every turn of the head, every varying form of expression that flitted over the fair face that had just risen like a new star in the firmament of his thought. Then followed the chanted prayers of the synagogue; and a voice, clear as a lute, sweet as a harp, filled his car with notes of melody, and attuned his soul in unison with that of the fair singer. He felt that he could serve for her even the fourteen years that Jacob had served and waited for Rachel his bride. He knew that she was conscious of his presence, for the brilliant color came and went upon her cheek, varying the rich, clear olive of her complexion with the glowing hues of her own Asiatic clime. Once, when the service was nearly ended, she raised her eyes and met his respectful, admiring glance, not willingly, it seemed, but by some subtile, delicate magnetism that drew her gaze to meet his own with an irresistible charm. At the close of the service Horace Vincent stood some- what in the shadow of the vestibule, and had the satisfaction of receiving a slight bow of recognition as the father and daughter passed out. A handsome face and figure alone would never have been sufficient to make so deep an impression upon his heart; for he had hitherto, in his college days, been deemed almost insensible to female attractions. But the beauty of soul that beamed from those deep, tender, intelligent eyes had met a swift answering, involuntary glance from his own, the mem- ory even of which was enough to quicken his pulse and fully engross his thoughts. Naturally enthusiastic and impetuous in his temperament, he half resolved that he would call upon them the same evening on their return from the synagogue. Then, smiling at what he mentally termed his foolish, boyish fancy, he determined that several days should pass before he   INTO THE LIGHT.          9 availed. himself of the permission implied by the carld. Being quite unable to concentrate his attention on his return home, upon the studies which usually occupied his mind, Horace Vincent threw down the pen which he had been ab. sently using upon a sheet of paper that lay near him, cover- ing it, as he thought, with unmeaning hieroglyphics, which, however, looked extremely like an imitation of the characters which were engraved upon the card that he held in his hand, and again sauntered forth, directing his steps towards the Battery. As he passed along, a sign met his eye, signifying that ready-made clothes were for sale, while at the door stood rather a good-looking specimen of the Hebrew nation, on the lookout for customers. Feeling already an interest in the Jewish people for the sake of a daughter of their race, he halted a moment, and then, obeying a strong impulse, passed into the shop. He was instantly accosted by the proprietor with solicitations to buy, while his keen, black eye sparkled with anticipated gain as he noticed the hand- some exterior of the stranger. While looking over a number of vests, in order to select a plain black one, Vincent employed the time in making some inquiries respecting their places of worship. Naming one with which he was already familiar, the Jew began to expa- tiate upon the rich families who attended it, and, among others, named Reuben Hammet, and proceeded to say that he lived after the straitest sect of the Hebrews in regard to the strict performance of their ritual service; that he was inflexible and arbitary in character to all except his only daughter, of whom he was justly proud. He had married late in life a beautiful girl twenty-five years younger than himself, who was now in her matronly prime, while her hus- band's white locks and slightly stooping figure contrasted somewhat unfavorably with his wife's still youthful appear- ance. Having obtained all the information that could be gleaned respecting these new objects of interest, Horace Vincent  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7355-00000007"/> 10        INTO THE LIGHT. turned his steps once more homeward, conscious of an un- usually vacillating state of mind. Being a man who suffered himself to be actuated only by purposes and motives which would bear analyzing, he could not then understand the ab- sorbing character of those emotions which seemed to over- power and exclude all his usual train of thought. The aim of his life had hitherto been that of the gospel ministry, and naught else had awakened genuine enthusiasm within his soul, except the consciousness of progress towards the great end at which he aimed. "What is, or ever will be, the Jewish maiden to me?" he murmured, musingly. "I am not wont to be thus enthralled by mere beauty. This lovely daughter of Israel can never be aught to one who has consecrated himself to the Lord, unless it may be to deepen my interest in that race to whom we owe so much, and for whom more constant and earnest prayer should be offered that they may soon behold with the eye of faith the Prince of Peace, their lost Messiah. I will tear this bewitching memory from my heart, and not again trust myself with another view of those charming feat- ures. And yet," he again resumed, "courtesy, common politeness, would dictate that I should inquire personally in regard to Mr. Hammet's health. Perhaps it would be best to call once only. My strength of character must be small, indeed, if I cannot withstand the fascination of a pretty face, simply, albeit that face is the first one that ever interested me so strongly." Thus plausibly do we reason when inclination takes the helm, and we turn away from the straight course of prudence and duty,   INTO THE LIGHT.         " CHAPTER II. A thought lay like a flower upon her heart, And drew around it other thoughts like bees. MRS. BROWNING. WITHN her father's stately mansion, surrounded by all the taste and luxury that wealth could purchase, sat, silent and abstracted, the Jew's fair daughter. Youth's airy structures of sunny beauty were rising in the most enchanting forms before the mental vision of sweet Naomi Hammet, and most prominent among them all stood the graceful figure of the young stranger. By that mysterious law of sympathy which governs all finely-constituted minds, she indistinctly under- stood that the higher qualities of his nature corresponded with her own, and hence the new and singular attraction she had felt when they first met. Roused suddenly from her pleasant revery by the entrance of a servant, bearing a card, followed by the very object of her thoughts, Naomi arose and extended her hand, while a deep and conscious blush attested her embarrassment for one moment; and then, with an ease and self-possession rarely seen in one so young, she addressed him by name, alluding at once to their first meet- ing, and expressing her gratitude for his promptness in averting a danger which had threatened her beloved parent. With a soul alive to the beautiful in every form, Horace Vincent saw at a glance the perfect symmetry of her figure, the unstudied grace of her attitude, and the chaste and cor- rect taste which had guided her in the selection of those colors in dress which harmonized best with the dark, oriental character of her beauty. But that which gave him most pleasure was the consciousness that a mind of no ordinary cultivation lighted up at intervals her expressive counte- nance; and, naturally avoiding the trifling subjects which *   &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7355-00000008"/> 12        INTO THE LIGHT. are usually taken up at a morning call, they were soon among the higher walks of English literature, - each intelli- gent remark only serving to show an independence of thought and a unison of taste and feeling he had never be- fore encountered among his lady friends. She had evidently an intellect accustomed to a critical analysis of whatever she might read, and possessed a vivid appreciation of the finer and more delicate shades of sentiment and poesy. There was a gentle, modest dignity pervading her whole demeanor, combined with a sparkling beauty of expression, as thought or feeling deepened the roses ulpon her changing cheek, which gave her an irresistible, womanly charm. The golden moments of that morning, hour passed swiftly on like some delightful dream, and Horace Vincent, having remained already much longer than is deemed necessary for a formal call, reluctantly arose to take leave of his fasci- nating companion, but was detained a short time by the en- trance of Mr. Hammet, accompanied by his wife, just returned from a morning drive. The mother of Naomi was formed, physically, like her daughter, - the same height and commanding dignity of car- riage, the same clear, olive complexion; but in the expres- sion of the face, the character of the forehead, there was a decided difference. Instead of the frank, fearless glance of the daughter, there was an anxious, timid look visible when she addressed her husband,--plainly showing that the an- cient rule of the old Hebrew patriarchs over their wives had not become extinct in their descendants. After the usual greeting and customary acknowledgments for a service rendered had passed, Horace Vincent became aware that the keen eye of the Jew was fixed upon him with a searching and peculiar expression. Apparently satisfied, however, with his scrutiny, he made some inquiries respect- ing his tarry in the city. And when told that his home there was only a temporary one, and that his future profession 'i   INTO THE LIGHT.         13 would undoubtedly be that of a minister of the gospel, an- swered by a slightly contemptuous,- Ah, indeed! Poor business! And, yet, without doubt, yotu are very sanguine that ' many shall come from the east an(d from the west ' to hear your preaching,- desirous of fame and a name, hey?" "I trust, sir," replied Horace, " that I have no unworthy ambition. I desire to follow the example of my Master, the lowly Galilean ; and the name to which I aspire is only that of his faithful disciple." ("No doubt! no doubt!" exclaimed Mr. Hammet, when his visitor again rose to leave. '"We are all enthusiasts in some way. Now, Mr. Vincent, come again and see us; and perhaps I can show you that all, too, are liable to be mis- talken." Grateful for the invitation to repeat his visit, and regard- less of the implied sneer, the young minister took his de- parture, remembering only the courteous and friendly fare- well of the mother and daughter. Horace Vincent had scarcely passed out, before another visitor entered, and was received with evident pleasure and animation by the old gentleman, with a constrained polite- ness by the mother, and a cool, lofty indifference by the daughter. The new-comer was evidently an old and privi- leged acquaintance, by the familiarity with which he seated himself, and introduced some of the common topics of the day. At last, takling up a book which Horace had just laid down, he addressed Naomi with some triflingr remark in re- lation to it, which was answered by her in a preoccupied, indifferent manner. "You seem in a brown study this morning, Miss Ham- met. May I ask, in the words of this author, ' What sweet memories cast their witching spell o'er heart and brain'?" lBusily engaged in selecting some shades of worsted for her embroidery, the young girl appeared not to hear that she 2  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7355-00000009"/> "-        INTO THE LIGHT. was addressed; but a slight shrinking could be observed when he lowered his voice, as if the words were intended for her ear alone. The new-comer, Joseph Fleming, was an especial favorite with Reuben Hammet. As he was the most wealthy young man among his own people, and -his sister's son, he was, therefore, allowed free access to the house, on the plea of re- lationship; while his undisguised admiration of his cousin was encouraged by her father, without the slightest reference to his daughter's dislike or preference. The rich Jew wnv about the middle height, and, at first sight, not unprepossess- ing in his personal appearance; but the bland, insinuatinr smile, which he so constantly wore, did not serve to entirely conceal the fierce and vindictive expression that was most natural to his dark, flashing eye. Possessed of a very fair share of intellect, he passed with society in general as a man of more than ordinary mind; but at heart he was capable of cold,-calculating villany. Naomi had, from her childhood, conceived a peculiar dis- like towards Joseph Fleming; and when his basilisk glance was fixed upon her, Could not comprehend the nameless dread which filled her soul. She felt as if some evil influ- ence was casting a powerful spell around her, and at such times, true to the promptings of the purity within her, she would leave the room, although she knew it displeased her father. Yet he had never openly addressed her on the sub- ject, but had imparted to his wife his desire that Joseph should become their son-in-law. Many sad hours had been passed by Mrs. Hammet, in view of this event, knowing the stern, inflexible character of her * husband, and fearing the consequences, should Naomi refuse to comply with his wishes; yet she secretly rejoiced when her daughter more decidedly manifested her aversion, as Jo- seph Fleming continued his visits, in the vain hope of receiv- ing one encouraging glance from those eyes, which, although they often made him conscious of his own littleness, pos-   INTO THE LIGHT.         15 sessed for him, at times, a singular charm. But at that mo- ment, when she rose to leave the apartment, it was plain, from the dark and gloomy expression of his countenance, that he felt her contempt with more than usual keenness., "I will no longer be treated like a fawning spaniel. I will humble this proud beauty ere I have done," he mut- tered, as he advanced towards the old gentleman, who was reading near an antique stand. Seated among the crimson cushions of his spacious arm- chair, from the hilgh back of which extended two branches, carved to imitate oak-leaves and acorns, forming a sort of canopy, or dark crown, above his bent hoary 1head, this old pa-triarch of an unfortunate people seemed calculated to inspire and command respect. Some such feeling arose in the mind of Joseph Fleming, as he paused a moment before he spoke; and then, assuming his blandest and most conciliating man- ner, he requested a few minutes' conversation. :' Certainly! My sister's son shall not ask so small a favor in vain," said the old gentleman, at the same time re- placing hIis glasses in their case, and bringing the fall power of his keen, inquiring eye upon the face of his nephew. A few murmured words froll Joseph seemed suddenly to alter the proud elevation of his countenance, and a humble, anxious, almost cringing expression succeeded. "And you say that this immense fortune shall be settled upon my daughter in her own right, and that bonds given before marriage shall make all sure; you, at the same time, yielding up all notes ever given by me, and, all claim tlp(on my estate?" 'Even this, and life itself, if need be, were Naomi but mine, wholly mine!" exclaimed Fleming. "' But her cold- ness and indifference increase every day, and I fear to frus- trate our plans by urging my suit too speedily." ' My cdaughter has no will but mine," replied Mr. Itammet. "Although much indulged from infancy, she hlas never op- posed my  ishes, ad  ill scarcely o reel.

Both rising at the same time, the two worthies ratified their agreement by a cordial grasp of the hand, and separated. CHAPTER III, The blessings of the skies all went about her; Health, grace, inimitable beauty wreathed Round every motion. On her lips the rose Has left Its sweetness, for what bee to kiss I And from the darkening heaven of her eyes A starry spirit looks out:- Can it be love? PROCTOR. AT the same hour, within a richly furnished chamber in another part of this stately mansion, wholly unconscious of Whe conspiracy against her peace, stood Naomi at a bow-win- dow, half concealed by the transparent folds of the soft lace curtainl, gazing upon the still, calm glory of that winter night with an uplifted face, upon which the starlight seemed to shed a holy, spiritual beauty. There was more soul, more womanly tenderness emanating from the depths of her large, dark eyes. Life had assumed another meaning; for a foun- tain of sacred, pure emotion had been opened in her heart by the potent power of love, which revealed to her a new existence. Not caring to analyze her feelings, or under- standing the source, she recalled every word spoken by Hor- ace Vincent, every look and action, until aroused by the en- trance of her waiting-woman, who had twice looked in to inquire if she called. Dispensing with her usual assistance, she threw off the maroon-colored velvet mantle, lined and bordered with soft ermine, which had been wrapped around   INTO THE LIGHT.         17 her graceful form, laid aside the gold bodkin which confined her hair, and, letting it fill over her shoulders like an ebon veil, passed through a side door, entered her mother's cham- ber, and craved her nightly blessing. An unusually stlrong attachment seemed to subsist between mother and daughter. For Rachel Hlammet had contributed fromn the rich stores of her own cultivated mind towards forming a character that needed but the graces of the Chris-. tianl to become incomparably lovely, SNaomni," said Mrs. Hammet, " what has depressed you, y chld? Why are you so silent and sad to-night?" "Alother, my thoughts have been, at times, sweet and un- lkttcrably mournful. I have a presentiment of coming evil, slclh as I never felt before; and yet, it seems to me, that I have lived months within the last few days. I feel that I hl:ave a nature within me that has just beaun to unfold to my Spiritulla vision its true character. Mother, I am no longer a child. I have an individual soul, and self-reliant powers." With the same feeling of wonder and awe that Mrs. Ham- met gazed upon the infant form of her daughter, when its first cry appealed to her motherly love and tenderness, did she now contemplate the change which had taken place in the beautiful being before her. She had passed through the pll:ses of childhood and girlhood, and now stood by her Nide in the solemn beauty of womanhood, her countenance irradiated and elevated by the new-born power within her that had been awakened by that love which is at once the solace and the sorrow of our mortal life. The mother bowed "r lecad ; and through the tear-dimmed vista of the past she beheld a vision of her own departed youth; lived o'er again the hour when love first threw its "' flowery fetters " round her young and guileless heart. And well, too well, did she comprehend the mutations of feeling that brought the elo- quent blood to her daughter's changing cheek, and imparted a softer lustre to her dark and soul-lit eye. She saw again the sunny home of her youth; stood beneath the grand and 2*  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7355-00000011"/> 18        IN TO TTIE LIGHT. stately elms that shaded her birthplace, with one manly form beside her, who was the ideal of her pure and true desires. She heard once morle those rich, melodious tones vibrating across her spirit's chords, - drawingr from thence celestial har. mony that swiftly responded to that spirit utterance, so ex. quisite, so subtile, and delicate, yet possessing so mighty, so immortal a power. Memory recalled the first " pure kiss that was folded down upon her lips in perfect sweetness; " and the dear consciousness that they were as one heart and one soul in their true and entire love for each other; every hour revealing some new  Charm, some added tenderness. So noble and majestic was his nature, that she drew with lavish hand from his cultivated mind rich and rare gems of thought, and laid them away as heart-treasures, to fertilize her fancy, to enrich her being, to expand her soul, until they became a repository of secret wealth, that rendered her whole existence the hlolier, the more divite for having loved. Almost too pure for earth, he passed away in the full vigor and beauty of manhood, - stricken down by a malignant fever, - leaving behind a name unsullied by a single blot, and a memory that remained an ever-living verdure in the hearts of all that knew him. After the first bitter grief had, in a degree, become sub- dued, the void in hler young hleart remained unfilled, until there arose a yearning for affection; and at last she selected from  among her many suitors leuben Hammet, whom  she invested with all the graces and virtues of him who had first won her youthfil love. Attractive in his personal ap- pearance above all that surrounded her (although many years older than herself), she saw the qualities of his mind only through the rose-colored medium of her first experience; and bitter, ah, how bitter, was her first awakening to the stern reality! Those memories crowded thick and fast upon her as she gazed upon her daughter with a sad tenderness, that im-   INTO THE LIGHT.         19 parted an indescribable pathos to the tones of her voice as she addressed her. "4 Woman's lot, my darling, is often one of tears and trials ; but if over life's dark clouds and shadows there is spanned the rainbow of true and requited affection, that, indeed, be- comes a panoply that will repel and overcome, in a great measure, all the ills of our earthly existence. The woe, the -misery, that an inharmonious marriage brings to the sensi- tive, loving nature of a pure-minded woman, who holds her vows sacred, and hides her sorrows with her tears from the world, is beyond description, and can never be fully esti- mated. Then, oh, beware, my child, of yielding even a thought of your heart to any man unless you know the qual- ity of his interior and true nature!" i' And can I not know this, dear mother, when I find my spirit shrink from the companionship of some with an inex- pressible dread, while in the society of others every good and noble feeling expands and matures? I feel, sometimes, in the presence of Dr. Heber and his wife, like a flower basking in the sun. They are truly good and pure, if they are Christians." "Some author," replied her mother, " has advanced the idea that around every individual is a sphere of his moral qualities, quite as perceptible to the moral sense of another (when that sense has not become obtuse), as the odor around the rose is perceptible to the physical sense. I believe," she continued, " that all -sensitive organizations have a slight consciousness of this grand truth." "Then how could I bear the idea for one moment, mother, of becoming the wife of Joseph Fleming? I have sometimes thought that my father's mind had become morbid upon the subject, from chance expressions which he has dropped; but I know that he loves me too well to ask me to give my hand without a heart." An expression of pain passed across the features of Mrs. Hammet as her daughter spoke, and she hesitated for a mo-  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7355-00000012"/> 20         INTO THE LIGHT.                ! ment, in doubt whether to burden her young heart with an- ticipations of coming evil, or to wait the chances of the future; the latter course she concluded to adopt, and, after a few more words of tender counsel, she bent to the kneeling form of her daughter, and repeated the Hebrew blessing, with a heart filled with sorrowful forebodings. CHAPTER IV. Standing with reluctant feet Where the brook and river meet, Womanhood and childhood fleet. LONGFELLOW. For a beauty and a mystery About the heart are thrown,  When childhood's merry laughter yields To girlhood's softer tone. WELBY. THE following week IIorace Vincent visited the old home- stead, situated in the small but flourishing village of L-, a few miles from the city, in hopes to forget in the society of his favorite sister the too bewitching memory of the Jewish maiden.   Before he had proceeded half way up  the long, gravel walk, nicely bordered with boxwood, his ear caught   the sweet, glad voice of his youngest sister, Laura, exclaim- ing, "Horace is coming!" and in another moment the door was flung wide open, and the wild, laughing, romping girl stood beside him, her dark eyes sparkling with joy, and her   face glowing with the winter air and recent exercise.       "Why, Laura, you rosy-cheeked fairy! you look the very    impersonation of health and happiness," said Horace, taking   both her little warm hands in his, as he stooped to give and receive the expected kiss.   "O Horace," she cried, "I am so glad to see you! because     INTO THE LIGHT.         21 you were not expected. Do you know that I have counted the days and the hours before you would be likely to come, and this morning I ciphered it all out, and made it just five days and eight hours? and now, only think, here you are!" ' Your arithmetic was at fault, you see, Miss Laura," re- plied Horace, smiling, as he gathered the heavy, brown curls which had blown over her face lovingly in his hand, swept them back from her fair, broad brow, and looked down into lher earnest face with true brotherly pride, as he continued: "That sum of yours must submit to the process of subtrac- tion before you get the proof correctly. But, tell me, why were you so anxious to see me?" l"Well, one reason was, that same arithmetic you spoke Of troubled me at school, and I wanted your help. Oh, it is so hard! I do think that Colburn did his best to puzzle young heads and make them ache over his difficult examples. I don't like that study at all. If it were not for sister Grace, I would say I hate it. I did say so once, and Mr. Harper said, ' Miss Vincent!' in such a solemn, reproving tone, that I felt just a little bit ashamed, -as if he thought I should be a young lady as well as a school-girl!" "And should you not?" inquired her brother, attempting to look grave; but still the mirthful gleam of his eye neu- tralized the sober reproof of his tongue. "Oh, yes, of course, I suppose so; but then, one does not wish to be so very stiff and proper all the time. I like to say just what I think, and speak as I feel, without being sup- pressed and crowded down, and shut up. sometimes feel    f like the prince in one of my fairy stories, who was' impris- oned in a casket, whose cover opened at times just enough for him to peep forth, but without allowing him his freedom. Now, sometimes, I wish that I could sing as loud as I please, and shout even, if I like, just as the boys do. Then, againi, when I see anything that I know to be wrong and unjust, I am provoked to protest against it with all my might, and   &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7355-00000013"/> 22        INTO THE LIGHT. straightway, snap goes the cover, and I am told to rccml- ber manners and propriety." "And was that the only reason, Laura, why you gave mIn so warm a welcome?" "Oh, no! there were a host of others, but one more only. I will tell you,--I did want a ride in grandfather's old sleigh so much; and now just see how the icicles are drop- ping from the syringas, and the sun is melting the snow so fast, that the sleighing is spoiled; but still, I don't care very much, as you will come again before Christmas, - won't you, Horace?--and I like anticipation. I think I enjoy that, after all, quite as much and rather more than the reality." This was said in an undertone, as she noticed her brother's gaze had wandered off to the distant hills, and he stood en- joying the bright beauty of the landscape. Then his eye rested upon the familiar objects around him; but how trans- formed within a few weeks! The lilac-trees, the thorn- bushes, and evergreens, all glittered with pendent jewels, that quivered and flashed in the morning sunlight. Far be- yond lay a pleasant, undulating country, with here and there a white dwelling-house, nestled among the hemlocks and pines that were wearing a snowy crown, which contrasted finely with the deep green foliage. Upon a slight eminence stood the picturesque village church; this arrested his gaze. The future career that he had often contemplated rose promi- nently before him, while his aspirations, like the church- spires, pointed heavenward. A life of usefulness; to minister to the sin-sick soul; self-renunciation for the sake of Christ; to become an earnest, active laborer in the vine- yard of the Lord, - this was his ambition, this the race he desired to run, the goal he wished to reach. A gentle touch roused him from his revery, and he turned to greet his sister Grace, a slender, graceful girl, whose expressive counte- nance was animated with undisguised pleasure and surprise, as she exclaimed,- "Why this unexpected visit, brother Horace? Have the   INTO THL   LIGHT.        23 1Ictht ll(  onl tholongy closed?  I hope so, indeed, for grand- tI'll ':411!' Iill(.os ()1br you, andu daily grows more feeble."  ( irm('," I'dplidll  Vincent, "' I have but a day and night to i: ;j:'c l; c':lilige and thhy dear presence seem necessary just "\ow to 'resto(rel n mnental equilibrium. Run, Laura, you lith(i gipscy! and say tlat we shall be in presently." Latura cast an arch, inquisitive look back at her brother as she bounded up the steps and disappeared within the house.   'IlThe two remained a few minutes in earnest conversation, and tlhen eltered the pleasant old mansion, and proceeded di- rectly to the parlor, where was seated a venerable white- lthaired, but still handsome man, near a table on which lay an open Bible. A crutch stood beside him, for paralysis had seized his lower limbs, rendering him unable to walk with- out its assistance, and he required constant care and atten- tion. Hlorace devoted the next hour to his amusement, told him one or two pleasant incidents connected with his student life, and all the little interesting news items he could remem- ber, givin(r the invalid something new to think about that migoht vary the monotone of thought incident to that disease. Early left orphans, in the care of the aged couple who had endeavored to supply the place of parents, the brother and sister had formed for each othler an attachment more than usually tender and confiding. Grace had faithfully nursed and soothed the last moments of her grandmother, - who died a rejoicing Christian,- and now she supplied a daugh- ter's place, by her unremitting kindness and gentle atten- tion, to her aged relative, whose greatest delight was to listen to her sweet voice as she read with emphasis and feeling from the pages of Holy Writ the sublime truths of the gospel. Thus did Grace Vincent day after day develop and per- fect the rare beauty of her character, by the exercise of those higher qualities of mind and heart so necessary to constitute a perfect womanhood. Within the recess of one of the deep bow-windows, Grace  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7355-00000014"/> 24         INTO THE LIGHT. and Horace sat talking long after the short twilight of that winter day. The fire ill the large open fireplace had burned down, leaving in front of the immense back-log a large bed of coals, that snapped and crackled every now and then, as if waiting to give the warmest welcome to three or four portly looking oak sticks, that were grouped in the chimney- corner. The old man Ihad watched the cheerful fire as he mused upon the busy, bustling city a few miles beyond, from which his grandson had broaught so many facts of interest, until he had yielded to the genial warmth and quiet, and was fast asleep in his easy-chair. An air of home comfort per- vaded the apartment. Grace had been sitting with bowed head as if listening attentively; she now raised it as Horace ceased speakin, and the moonlight falling across her brow imparted a soft, tender beauty to her face that harmonized well with the sweet tones of her voice as she replied,- "It has always appeared to me, Horace, to be one of the heaviest sorrows that can assail our poor humanity, - a mis- placed affection. Peculliarly interesting as the Jewish people are, yet they are a distinct nation, and almost seem destined ever to remain so. Separated so entirely as they are from the Gentile world in their religious belief, it is not common to hear of a marriage among them outside of their syna- gogule. "There are, as you know, occasional converts to Christian- ity, showing that the Lord mIanifests himself at times to his chosen people. Still such hopes are not for you, my brother; you belolg to the Lord. Let the future be,-- "'A life that shall send   A challenge to its end,   And when it comes, say, Welcome, friend!"  "Grace," replied Horace, gravely, "I will think of her  of whom I have spoken as of some fair vision, some delight-  fulf dream. I have never before met with a female character ' tlat I could place within the temple of my heart, side by    INTO THE LIGHT.         25 sile with my beloved sister. I now displace the fair image of the Jewish maiden, hopeless of ever again enshrining it there. A truce with all this folly! Henceforth I will have but one aim, one object, - the advancement of my Master's kingdom,- and thus will life's great end be met- " "Its guerdon nobly won," interrupted Grace, at the same time rising to answer her e grandfather, who had wakened from his short nap, consulted his large silver watch, and announced the time near for their evening service. Horace and Grace sought their sister Laura, and found ler standing at a window in the hall, gazing with a rapt ex- pression of countenance upon the unusual splendor of the aurora borealis, whose long lines of rosy light reached even to the zenith. A quiet diglnity pervaded the little figure as she raised her hand with a slight gesture of command when her brother and sister drew near, and, pointing to the north, said, - "Behold! The heavens declare the glory of God!" They stood a moment in silent admiration, and the un- spoken yet spontaneous homage of their loving hearts as- cended in that hour towards the great Father as a pure and igi  acceptable offering. Then Horace turned and drew his sister Lalra near him and looked down into the versatile beauty of her face with surprise at the change which a few short months had wrought in her expressive features, - at one time seeming so self- reliant, imaginative, and womanly, at another nothing but a sportive school-girl, as she caught with quick perception somewhat of his thought, and turned shyly from his tender gaze, saying,- "Please let me go now, brother Horace, and get my music- book; grandfather will not rest content without our eveningo hymn." Horace paid no heed to her request at first, until a slight shake of the shoulders denoted her impatience; then he re- leased the little, soft hands which he had held in his, with an amused smile at her chalnging humor, and she bounded up 3  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7355-00000015"/> 26         INTO TIIE LIGHT. the stairs, singing a wild carol as she went, with all the care-" less thoughtlessness of childhllood. ' There are elements of chlaracter in Laura," said Horace, '" that if well developed will make a superior woman. There is a little too much wilffulness predomninating. Still these shoots of evil may be carefully pruned by the hand of affec- tion." '( She has given me many an anxious hour," replied Grace, 'C because I have feared her too sensitive, enthusiastic nature- would never be fitted to encounter the stern realities of life. As long as it is possible, as I promised our mother, I will stand between her and aught that may impart to her life a single sorrow. I have taken the responsibility not without many prayers for aid and direction froml the great Source of divine wisdom. I think," she continued, "( grandfather is getting impatient for his etvening reading. I hear the sound of his crutch; he is trying to walk alone." Horace sprung forward as they re-entered the parlor, ad- justed the cushion in the old man's arm-chair, then, wheeling it in front of the fire, he waited respectfully for him to be seated. Grace placed the small stand beside him on which lay the family Bible, and then calling Aunt Hannah, the old house- keeper, friend, and servant, and her sister Laura, they gath- ered in devotion around the family altar. The tones of the old man's voice, when he commenced reading, were tremulous, but, as he proceeded through one of the divine Psalms of David, his enunciation grew clearer and firmer; his bowed figure gradually straightened, and as he finished with "Bless the Lord, O my soul!" he seemed like an inspired patriarch of old filled with the whole counsel of God. Then went up the voice of prayer and thanksgiving from the lips of the youngl pastor, more chlastened and fer- vent than usual in consequence of his recent heart-struggle, but still confidingc and hopeful. As Horace was to leave before sunrise the next morning,   "NTO TEE LGHT.          27 his flrewells were mingled with his cheerful good-nighlt; and the little family retired to rest, while holy influences seemed to cluster around, and fall like gentle dew upon each heart, with a power indescribably sweet and peaceful. C CHAPTER V. "Ah, faint as the faint bells ringing in silence. within the ear, And dim as the wavering moonbeams the hopes of my life appear." What spirits round my weary way are flying, ' What fortunes oil my future life await, Like the mysterious hymns the winds are sighing, Are all unknown; I bide my fate 1 TuCrE )rMAN. THE morning was cold and dreary, and the absence of sun- shine in the external world only served to render a shadow which had been creeping over the heart of Naomi still darker and more oppressive. Youth's first sorrow!  Who can fathom its depths or por- tray its intensity!  Far more keenly do we feel pleasure or pain in lif's early morninl than when in I alLterr years repeated disappointments have left the heart in a decgree passively indifferent to the thronging ills of libe. Let none lighltly esteem  the tears and trials of girlhood and youth.   So sensitive and delicate, so impressionable is the young nature, so susceptible to wounded   feeling, that the cup of bitterness is often quaffed at thlat period with anguish to after days unknown. Joseph Fleming had been recently allowed to visit at the house in the most familiar manner at all times in the day. If seated in the drawing-room at her sewing, she would sud- denly become   conscious that some  baneful presence was near; and, raising her eyes, she would be sure to behold the lank figure and lowering physiognomy of her cousin, who had a peculiar way of entering noiselessly into the house and  ,                &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7355-00000016"/> 28 :       INTO THE LIGHT. appearing by her side unannounced. If seated in the library, suddenly she would be startled by the low, insinuating tones of her persecutor, repeating some line she had just been reading with the most consummate assurance, and then, with a certain degree of talent, would expatiate upon its merits or beauty in a manner that would have interested Naomi, were it not that all that was devotional in its sentiment was scorned with the utmost heartlessness. There was a high moral tone of character natural to the young Jewess, which made her instinctively shrink from aught that might lower, in any way, her ideas of goodness and virtue, and she could not endure to hear right and wrong mingled in one common mass, and all denounced as evil. She was waiting one morning the coming of her father, with the hope that she might win him back to something like his old indulgent manner, when her hand, which had been resting upon the arm of her chair, was touched by another, and, before she was aware, it was clasped in that of her cousin. Naomi withdrew it at once, and rose indignantly. "Why, may I ask, Mr. Fleming, this systematic intrusion upon me at all times? Surely, relationship does not warrant such constant espionage. You would, I imagine, in this re- spect, make a most accomplished Jesuit," said the young girl, with unusual bitterness. "' My cousin cannot have misconstrued my evident regard. I have long waited for an opportunity to confess how deep, how idolatrous is my attachment to you, Naomi. Suffer me to speak. Turn not from me, I pray you, when I de- clare that I love you, have long loved you with entire devo- tion." The cool, self-possessed, and slightly contemptuous man- ner with which Naomi listened to this speech surprised and confounded her companion; and, with a voice which grew tremulous with a variety of emotions, he again spoke, - "You are unfeeling, cousin. Why is it that you thus avoid one who is ready to become your most devoted slave?"   INTO THE LIGHIT.        29 "(I cannot but think you are aware the subject of love from your lips is to me a most distasteful theme," replied Naomi, calmly, fixing her large, dark eyes upon him as she spoke. "Ah! indeed! But doubtless from otheri lips a most deli- cate and savory morsel! If I mistake not, there is another person from whom it would be very acceptable," said Jo- seph, with a malicious smile, as he remembered some few words of interest she had spoken in relation to her father's preserver. The color deepenedl upon Naomi's cheek, but still retaining her calmness, she replied, -- "It is quite useless, this conversation. You know, Joseph Fleming, that there is no love in my heart towards you, and why seek to'wed one Who can never regard you with any- thiDng but perfect indifference? I could never be induced to so outrage the holy tie of marriage. And now, I entreat you, let the subject never again be mentioned between us." "You were ever wont to be an affectidnate daughter, Naomi," replied Joseph, speaking in tones of the most woo- ing solicitation-; "' and when I tell you that a union with me will place on a firm foundation the now tottering fortunes of your father's house, you will, I am sure, exonerate me from selfish motives. I am his largest creditor; and, should I remove my support, he falls. It is with deep pain that I have recently observed his failing health, - undoubtedly owing to mental disquietude, - and for this reason I have, perhaps prematurely, urged my suit. O Naomi, I cannot be happy without'you!" "Cease, sir!" said Naomi, rising. "It may be true that my father is much involved; I knew it not; but he would. not so dispose of his only daughter. If it had ever been his purpose, it was because he wars in error respecting my senti- ments towards you." "We shall see! we shall see'!" muttered Joseph, with compressed lips, leaving the apartment as noiselessly- as he 3*  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7355-00000017"/> 30        INTO THE LIGHT. had entered it, while Naomi felt as if some horrible dream had passed away. Tears gave relief to her overwrought feelings as she sought vainly to banish from her mind the conviction that there was truth respecting much that had been said regard- ing her father's embarrassments. Many things came to her mind, until now overlooked. Her father's fretfulness and long interviews with her cousin; his sad, abstracted manner and unusual severity towards herself; and then came the withering thought, "Can it be possible that my father would be willing thus to barter me away? No, I will not believe it!" she exclaimed. "Cold and stern as he is at times to my mother, he has always been tender to me. I will wait for him, as I first intended, and relieve this intolerable sus- pense." * At that moment the door-bell rang with a quick, nervous peal, and she heard her father say to the servant, as he en- tered,- "'Ben, go to my daughter's room, and say that I wish to see her immediately." Before he had time to deliver his message, Naomi ran lightly down; and, calling up a cheerfulness she did not really feel, she met her father with the customary affection- ate salutation. The old man did not return her caress, but his angry, de- termined expression softened for one moment as he glanced ,at his beautiful daulghter; and then his tones fell coldly upon her ear as he bade her follow him at once to the library. As soon as they entered, with an arbitrary severity, that startled and grieved her, he demanded to know what she meant by insulting her cousin as she had done that morning. "I have just met him," he continued, " and he tells me that he has offered you his heart, hand, and fortune, and been scornfully refused." "Father," replied Naomi, with gentle firmness, " a life of   INTO T1I E Li4n,         i 1 unmitigated misery would be the conssequcnce of such a union." "Stuff! nonsense! just the sentimentality of the youing women of the present day! They must choose congenial souls, forsooth, Or else it is no marriage." Thus speaking, Mr. Hammet arose and commenced pacing the long space between the library windows with impatient strides.           l Naomi looked at her father in silent wonder. Could it be that he was really in the toils of that man? that Joseph had been deliberately planning for the last two years to bring about this result? She did not think him capable of a tyue attachment; and, mingled with his imagined fancy for her- self, she saw, prominent over all, the avaricious, grasping spirit of money-getting, alike the idol and bane of their race. Betrayed into a temporary impatience, it was not Mr. Hammet's policy thus to operate. He knew full well that she could be reached better through the affections, and, changing his tone, he said, - "Naomi, my child, I have long delayed telling you the, worst, hoping that I might, in some way, unweave the, en- tanglements which surround me. Our house has lost by un- expected failures and unwise speculations more than it could have sustained a year since, had it not been for the loans furnished by your cousin Joseph; and he is still wealthy enough to cancel every note in my favor if he be only per- mitted to aspire to your hand. You have ever been an obe- dient daughter, and I would fain have you -" "An item of merchandise bought and sold," interrupted Naomi, while through the gathering tears there flashed from her dark, beautiful eyes a mingled expression of wounded pride and forbearing tenderness, as she gazed upon her father's prematurely gray hair, and seemed to realize that it had not been without many a heart-struggle that he had at last resolved to urge his daughter to what seemed to him the only alternative.  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7355-00000018"/> 32        INTO THE LIGHT.  Little by little had he seen his property wasting away, and ! had learned to look upon Naomi as the only means of escape from that poverty which he plainly saw in the distance, and which he dreaded worse than death. Approaching his daugh- ! ter, he bent over her as if about to speak, but turned again silently away, to hide the tears he seemed unable to repress. "Father," said Naomi, with a choked utterance, I( oh, spare me this! I cannot bear to see you weep. I feel ready to ldo almost anything you wish, rather than witness this emotion, and know that I am the cause." Much has been said respecting the potent power of woman's tears; but it is doubtful whether their influence can at all compare with such evidences of deep feeling on the part of the sterner sex. A woman has an idea that the fountains of feeling must be painfully stirred to their very depths, be- fore a man will betray any signs of tearful emotion. And, with her whole soul wrought up in sympathy at the sight, Naomi became tender and pitying at once. Reuben Hammet had lived long enough to know this, and calculated well its power, as he walked away to the window, apparently making an effort to appear calmly indifferent. Distressed beyond measure, Naomi continued,- "Father, give me time to think upon this matter. My brain is confused, and at present the very thought is more than I can bear." "Compose yourself, my daughter; there is no haste; make your decision deliberately. I feel that your parents' happi- ness is more to you than your own. There are qualities in you, I know, that will lead to self-renunciation, and arouse the martyr-spirit of our race." With consummate diplomacy he had appealed to her affec- tional nature, the dormant heroism of her character, and re- solved to await the issue, nothing doubting but that it wou 1 be most favorable to his fondest hopes. Bewildered by the conflicting emotions of the last hour, Naomi sought her chamber, and yielded awhile to overpow-   INTO THE LIGHT.          33 ering grief. There was no recognized Saviour to whisper i"Peace, be still!" and shed a holy calm upon the stormy waters of her troubled soul. The sweet solace of prayer, the seeking for aid, comfort, and direction from One who is nearer than a brother to those who trust him, was denied her, and she drifted about upon a sea of irresolution, doubt, and despondency. The young girl drew towards her a pearl-enamelled writing- table, on which lay a richly bound copy of one of the Jewish service-books, listlessly opened it, and read a few moments the wailing chant appointed for the ninth day of Ab. "But I was sold for ages, and cut off with severity when I went forth from Jerusalem, and' there was none to help." She found therein no blessed promise and invitation to the weary children of earth, that could shed light and hope upon her immortal nature. "Come unto me and I will give you rest," breathed not across the tuneful chords of her spirit those celestial harmonies that whisper to the inmost ear of joy and life eternal. A deep sigh was a touching comment upon the broken cistern that held no water for her thirsting, asking soul; and there grew within her a vague yearning for some clearer light of revelation, whose calm lustre might dispel    i the shadows which clustered so thickly around her. The will- power was unusually strong in the mind of this sad daugh- ter of Israel; and at last, with a determined effort, she ex- erted it, until the mists were partially displaced from her mental vision, and she was enabled to reason and think with more calmness of the dreaded future.  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7355-00000019"/> 34         INTO THE LIGIIT.

FOR an hour after Naomi left the library, Reuben Hammet remained in an attitude of deep thoulght, covering the blanl pages of a note-book withl figures, which only seemed to perplex and irritate him. "Would that I had never seen the inside of the gold room!" he muttered. "There I first imbibed this constant craving for excitement." He looked at his watch, then arose quickly and went to his escritoire, unlocked a side panel, and took out a small, green case, containing a silver key; this he placed carefully in his vest- pocket, and then putting on his overcoat and slouched hat, he sallied forth. The day had been cold and cloudy, and now the snow- flakes, falling thick and fast, were a sufficient excuse for him to turn up his rich fur collar and loop it across his face, thereby effectually protecting himself from the weather, and securing the very disguise he at that time required. Pass- ing up one avenue and down another, threading with care intricate but what seemed to him familiar paths, he paused before a tall, brick building, that looked like a deserted store. The wooden shutters were all closed, and no light gave the least indication that it was occupied. Using a common latch-key, he entered the building, the stairway of   INTO THE LIGHT.         35 which was dimly lighted by a small gas-burner. " Cold and dark below, but light and warmth above," he murmured. Ascending the uncarpeted stairs, he paused a moment be- fore a green baize door, and, drawing aside a part of the fluted covering, he placed his lips to a speaking-tube, that was in this way concealed from the uninitiated, and whis- pered the password. In a moment the door was swung noiselessly on its hinges, and, admitting the new-comer, was instantly closed and bolted by a lamne African, whose only occupation was to keep his ear near the small ivory mouth- piece that was visible on the inside of the door. Tossing a small coin into the negro's outstretched hand, the Jew ascended another flight of stairs, at the extremity of which was a highly-polished mahogany door, with a silver plate on the side, very curiously carved.  Inserting the small key which he carried in his vest-pocket, lie murmured, "( Silver removes all barriers." The door yielded to his touch, and, although it was still day, there streamed from within a blaze of light that was absolutely blinding. The interior disclosed an immense apartment, or hall, fur- nished in a style of princely magnificence. A large, gilded table stood near the entrance, on whose marble top was spread the choicest viands that wealth could furnish. Open-worked baskets of silver, lined with blue and crimson satin, pre- sented in tempting array rare hot-house fruits, golden peaches, heavy clusters of white and purple grapes, ba- nanas, sparkling wines, and all the delicacies of distant climes. Here the privileged habitue of the place might, un- stinted, feast the eye and the appetite; but often the deli- cious fruit proved, like that said to be found upon the borders of the Dead Sea, temptingly fair in outward seeming, but turning to ashes on the lips. The walls were hung with rich- est tapestry, excluding light and sound. Gaming-tables, over which hung superb chandeliers, were placed at intervals around. At one end, and within a sort of alcove, upon a slightly raised platform, sat one who seemed to be the pre- &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7355-00000020"/> 36        INTO THE LIGHT. siding genius of the place. Every now and then small slips of paper were brought to him, which he cashed, gathering up the glittering gold in heaps, while his eagle eye seemed to note every table and the countenance of every sitter at the same moment. Passing down the hall, with a nod to the right and left, as if a well-known visitor, Reuben Hammet paused at a table near the alcove, and was greeted with the liveliest satisfac- tion by his worthy nephew. "Why, my dear sir, you are the soul of punctuality and honor!" he exclaimed. "Leave out the last word, I pray you," said Mr. Hammet, sadly. "The frequenters of such a place as this, and honor, seem to me, have parted company. I am almost ruined; were it notiso, you would not see me here. I have no fel- lowship with the gambling fraternity. We Jews do not usu- ally visit their gilded hells." But this establishment cannot be called by so harsh a name. It is very exclusive, as you know. The silver key which you have admits only gentlemen of the highest re- spectability and wealth," replied Fleming, while a strange, satirical smile crossed his features as he emphasized the last word. "But," he continued, "I do not understand what you mean by almost ruined." "6 Only this," replied Mr. Hammet. "My visits in Wall Street are over for the present. That was a most unfortu- nate speculation of mine yesterday at the Stock Exchange. Your information, Joseph, was incorrect, for I bought and lost fifteen thousand, and as much more in the gold room. One of the parties is a friend of yours, I afterwards found." A keen look of suspicion flashed from the eye of Mr. Hammet as he made the last remark, but it was received un- moved. A few moments more passed in earnest conversation, dur- ing which the face of Joseph Fleming grew darker and more malignant, and then they seated themselves at a faro-table. i   INTO THE LIGHT.        37 Thus the love of gain, the insatiable passion for gold specu- lations, had ended in a more unlicensed mode of gambling, -had drained the once well-filled coffers of the Jew, and warped and stifled every noble and elevated quality of his nature, until, at last, he had stooped to barter away his greatest jewel, his only daughter, with a coolness that plainly showed the power avarice had gained over every other emotion. "Unheeded flew the hours," and deeper and deeper as' the evening wore on did the Jew become involved in the toils of his tempter. With a' steady eye and firm hand Joseph Flem- ing directed the game, so that the hazard which he incurred was slight, compared with that of his adversary, who had, of late, grown nervous and vacillating. Later than usual did they remain playing, when the tinkle of a silver bell arrested attention, and a voice from the platform announced, - "It is the last hour, gentlemen; in five minutes more the establishment closes." The uncle and nephew rose to go; but Joseph Fleming, in-' stead of waiting with his usual deference for the old gentle- man to precede him, seemed to throw off at that time his disguise and assume his true nature, as, with an air of con- scious power, he strode down the hall, leaving his companion to follow as best he might. Mr. Hammet, absorbed by a multiplicity of painful emo- tions, did not observe the change in his nephew, but pro- ceeded mechanically homeward. Neither did he observe that a wintry tempest was abroad, so that the streets were nearly deserted. The flickering gas-lights revealed, however, two fig- ures standing in the deep shadow of a high church-wall near, - ill-omened birds of prey, on the scent for fortunate gamesters. "Look, Jim," whispered one, ' there goes an old chap whose pockets are lined with gold. It wouldn't take much to upset him; he totters now. Let's out and after him." "Sam Beagles, you're a smart cove!" replied his com- 4 *  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7355-00000021"/> 38        INTO THE LIGHT.  panion. '"When you gets experience in the way of the world, and a knowledge of human natur', you will not risk your life  for a man who carries a face like his'n. He's cleaned out,  you may depend. Why didn't you take the signal that I    gave when the tall one went by? He's the right game.  I didn't dare to whisper even; he hears and sees every-  thing. His pocket-book was worth having. We shan't get another chance to-night, and we might as well go home,"  continued the man, moodily, " for I can't stand this north-  easter; it cuts a fellow like a, knife;" and he handled a  short, broad knife, which he carried in his sack, with a sav-  age grip of disappointment as they walked slowly away.  Reuben Hammet reached his own dwelling with no con- sciousness of the hidden danger that had lurked by the way-  side, and, contrary to his usual custom, when out late, pro-  ceeded directly to his chamber. As he entered, he paused a moment to observe his wife, who was sitting at her deska reading. A sigh escaped him, as he noticed how much younger she appeared than himself; for the massive pier- : glass revealed his iron-gray locks and care-worn features in painful contrast. And yet, when he looked again, he sawi that she had been weeping; and a slight emotion of pity crossed his mind, as he remembered how little real compan-  ionship she had enjoyed in his society, and dimly compre-  hended that something more was necessary than simply the   marriage bond to constitute a true and happy union. A closely fitting black satin dress displayed her fine figure to advantage, which was relieved of its sombre appearance by folds of the richest Mechn lace across the open bodice, that was fastened by a large diamond pin, the miniature of which sparkled upon one of her slender and delicate hands. Her manner was unusually quiet, stately, and cold, - the result of early disappointment in the choice of her. heart; for, she had learned too late that Reuben Hammet had married her more for her property, - which was large, - than from any genuine affection. Little by little had she seen the fair ideal 4i. *   INTO THE LIGHT.         39 of her youth shorn of its charms, and the calculating, mer- cenary man of the world stand in its place. She possessed qualities of mind and heart that would have elicited the most devoted attachment from a man capable of appreciating them; but she rose so far above the level of his mind, that there was little congeniality between them. She had learned a bitter lesson, and was even timid in his presence. Look- ing up anxiously as her husband approached, she -said,-- "Reuben, I thought I would wait for you to-night. I want so much to talk with you about our daughter." "Has Naomi been telling you of her brilliant prospects?" interrupted her husband, bitterly. "My sister's son is cer- tainly a most eligible match for a portionless girl." "Portionless!" repeated Mrs. Hammet, with alarm and surprise. "You are surely jesting?" ("I am not, indeed," he replied; L never was more in earnest in my life. On the one hand, we have the prospect of privation, poverty, and toil; on the other, a fortune worthy of a queen, if Naomi becomes the wife of Joseph Fleming." "But I do not comprehend," Mrs. Hammet falteringly re- plied. "Our fortune should be sufficient for all our wants. What can you mean by poverty?" "I might as well tell you, Rachel, that I am a beggar!  This house, this filrniture, is not mine. Another has full control over all, and we are tenants at will. There is but one way, and that an easy one, to regain what we have lost." While he had been speaking, his wife had approached him, and, laying her hand gently upon his shoulder, she said, with a sad and heart-broken sweetness,- "Listen to me patiently for one moment, Reuben. I want you to look back upon the past, upon our life of ease and opulence, and tell me if those mere externals havre yielded happiness to our craving, asking hearts? Has it never oc- curred to you, do you not dimly comprehend, that there is k  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7355-00000022"/> 40        INTO THE LIGHT. an inner life of joy and peace almost wholly independent of that which has so'engrossed our time and thoughts? Is it not possible that we may be happier than we ever yet have been, in poverty and seclusion? Shall we arbitrarily plan a future for our daughter similar to our own, or shall life's vicissitudes and toils be to her like a refiner's fire, purifying the dross of her character, and leaving her heart and affec- tions at liberty to follow the instincts of her nature, which are pure and true?" "All that sounds very well in theory, Rachel; but there is a stern reality about us now, which must be met with all the fortitude and heroism of our race. The future is not our own; our business is with the present." "But yet, Reuben, we are immortal; and do not the ac- tions of this life shape our eternal destiny? It is a fearful responsibility, the charge of our own soul; but when we take that of another, and sacrifice it Upon the altar of selfishness, who shall estimate the amount of evil thus sown that shall yield fruit ages hence?" The dark clouds which had been brooding over the mind of Reuben Hammet parted for an instant, as his wife ceased speaking, and let in a gleam of light upon his moral nature that revealed, with fearful distinctness, his future account- ability, the perishable nature of earthly riches, the'shortness of life, and the immortality of his being. With a great effort of his iron will he banished the intense regret and mournful forebodings which pervaded his soul, and angrily replied, - "Yes, and become still more the scorn and reproach of the'Gentile world! Gold is the foundation upon which we stand, and never will I voluntarily put aside the advantages which must accrue from this union, and which you seem to think so great a calamity. I shall expect Rachel to have no counteracting influence in this matter, and trust you will soon see as I do in relation to it." A sigh escaped Mrs. Hammet, but she made no reply, feel-   INTO THE LIGHT.           41 ing that it would be useless. Very soon the disturbed mind of her husband was composed in the forgetfulness of sleep, while his wife's finer and more delicate organization, a prey to painful thoughts, required hours to regain its usual calm- ness. "I Heart gazing mournfully back through past years, Bringing sad memories laden with tears; Close up the record, fraught with such pain; Years that have vanished return not again." CHAPTER VII.

A WEEK had passed since the gambling interview between the uncle and nephew, and they had not once met. It did not suit Fleming to give his victim another chance to retrieve his failing fortunes; but having at last almost consummated his plans, he began to feel the short-lived, exultant joy of successful wickedness. Ay, proud Naomi," he muttered, '" thou art now in my power! and what, perchance, I love still more than thy regal beauty. Truly, gold is the ' open sesame' to all happiness. It is the lever that moves the world!" Thus communing with himself, the Jew     passed down Broadway and entered a fashionable saloon. The moment 4*  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7355-00000023"/> 42        INTO THE LIGHT. he made his appearance, two or three idlers accosted him familiarly. "Ah, Fleming!" said a young man, with light hair and sandy mustache. "Champagne and sardines, as you per- ceive, have a consumptive tendency in our vicinity. By-the- by, Frank and Dacre are almost beside themselves to know who was that beautiful girl that returned your bow with such queenly haughtiness as you passed up Fifth Avenue this morning." The blood mounted to the temples of Joseph Fleming, making his dark visage still more swarthy, as he answered, indifferently, - "Oh, she was only coquetting, a little piqued at my long absence. To tell the truth, I have stayed away quite too long from this gentle fair one." "Whose whole existence depends upon your smiles," in- terrupted his companion. "Well, come now, Fleming, give us the name, and we will drink the health of this bewitching stranger." "Why, Frank, don't you know that was Miss Hammet, the wealthy Jew's daughter, residing in F- Square?" said a little, pert, effeminate-looking youth, about nineteen years of age. "Egad! I am bound to try my luck in that quar- ter some day, I think. Thanks to my hair-dresser and tailor, there would be a good prospect of my success." "That is, if the lady considered brains quite superfluous," said Dacre, coolly. "Well," drawled his companion, "I would say that I think ' a fair exchange no robbery;' as many of the young ladies of the present day seem to exist without that impor- tant article of head furniture." "Everything dependlls upon outward adornment, then, you think?" said the first speaker, laughing. "Almost," replied the youngster, nothing daunted at the merriment that was going on at his expense. "At least, among the fair sex."   INTO THE LIGHT.         43 Some time longer was spent in this trifling conversation, in which Fleming joined with a careless unconcern that plainly showed his low appreciation of female character; while he allowed the name of Naomi to be familiarly bandied from mouth to mouth, feeling none of that sensitive delicacy which leads every high-minded man, with jealous care, to screen within the sacred enclosure of his heart, at times, even the name of her he loves, lest it be profaned by the thoughtless and licentious. At the upper end of the saloon sat a gentleman, appar- ently reading a newspaper, who had, however, been an at- tentive and indignant listener, as the flashing of his keen eagle eye, and the contemptuous curl of his short upper lip plainly indicated. This gentleman was also a Jew, but one of nature's noblemen, in the full beauty of ripened manhood. His high, broad forehead, lofty, arched eyebrows, and flow- ing black beard, with a certain erect carriage of the head, peculiar to the educated Jew, were unmistakable signs of his Hebrew origin. Rising with an impatient gesture, he passed directly in front of Joseph Fleming, who acknowl- edged his cold, slight recognition by a low, deprecating bow. "There goes Dr. Heber!" cried one of Fleming's com- panions. "One would think he was a prince royal, by the way he sweeps by us plebeians. Is it true, think you, that he seeks out the poor and suffering, and gives of his abun- dance liberally?" "I don't know much about him," muttered Joseph. "1 believe he gives his professional services to some who cannot afford to pay, but for reasons which are obvious to my mind, at least." "Ah! then you think him like the proud Pharisee of old, who gave alms to be seen of men," said the elder of the trio. He received an affirmative smile from Fleming, who thus wreaked his revenge upon the absent in return for the hu-  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7355-00000024"/> "        INTO THE LIGHT. Iniliating feeling of inferiority, which he could never entirely overcome in the presence of Dr. Heber. As they sauntered out, Joseph Fleming seemed to be sud- denly filled with a new thought, and, parting with his com- panions, walked hastily in the direction of Wall Street. '1 Why not expedite matters?" he murmured. "I have waited long enough; and Reuben Hammet must be more prompt in the execution of my demands, or I call at once a meeting of creditors, and he will be declared insolvent, or, in other words, a beggar!" Once within the precincts of his counting-room, the Jew seemed metamorphosed into the keen, practical business man; and, after a long conference with his partner, and his books, he closed them with a feeling of profound satisfac tion, which was sensibly increased as the colored servant of Mr. Hammet entered, bearing a note from his master. Fleming complacently received it, but, as he read, his brow contracted, and he uttered an impatient exclamation, signifying to the servant that he need not wait for an an- swer. The note stated that in consequence of the sudden illness of the writer, no further arrangements could be made in re- gard to final settlements, but trusted that he would pacify the most importunate of his creditors in the same way that he had befriended him before. At that point the writing had become almost illegible, as if the mind of the writer wan- dered, and his sight failed him. "This I believe to be mere subterfuge,- a farce, to cause further delay!" angrily exclaimed Joseph Fleming. "I will put this matter beyond a doubt by trusting to the evidence of my senses only; " and, seizing his hat, he passed out has- tily in the direction of F--  Square.   INTO TH  V LIGHT.        45 CIAPTER VIII. And throned on her hills sits Jerusalem yet, But with dust onI her forehead and chains on her feet; For the cream of her pride to the mocker hath gone, And the holy Shechinah is dark where it shone. ITTIER WTTIIN a darkened chamber, turning upon a sick-bed, in all the weary restlessness of typhoid fever, lay Reuben H-ammet, t1-s suddenly compelled to relinquish the execu- tion of those selfish plans for the future that had so filled his mind, to the exclusion of all claims of natural affection. Memory seemed preternaturally active, while conscience arose and asserted its claims, and the stern, proud rmn, quailed under their united accusations. His whole life passed in a panoramic view before him, and, unable, to put' aside deeds and scenes that he himself condemned, he groaned aloud. Naomi, who was seated near the foot of the bed, sprang instantly forward, saying, - "Dear father, what can I do for you? Are you in pain?" "Yes, daughter, but such pain as you cannot alleviate. It will soon pass away, however, as it has before. Is Dr. Tober coming this morning? I think I was asleep when he left yesterday." "Yes, father, I expect him every moment. In the mean tiime shall I read to you in the liturgy?" Receiving an assenting nod, Naomi seated herself near him, and commenced the daily prayers of the synagogue. While thus engaged, Dr. Heber entered with Mrs. Hammet, who paused at the door, while the good physician reverently uncovered his head and stood still, as the clear, musical tones of Naomi's voice repeated,- "It is the voice proclaiming the period of redemption;  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7355-00000025"/> "        INTO THE LIGTIT. and the people shall see light; and it shall come to pass at eventide there shall be light, and I will declare the glad tidings." "Why, doctor," said Mrs. Hammet, "I thought, when you renounced Judaism, that all respect for our honored litany had departed." "You mistake me, dear madam. I honor the same God whom you worship,--the God of our fathers; but that glorious light, which you believe is yet to dawn, has been revealed to my perception in its meridian splendor, and I see clearly, by the eyes of my soul, the God of Jacob mani- fested to man in Jesus of Nazareth, the Desire of nations! the King of Israeli I have not ceased to be a Jew, but am doubly one now that I see in the Messiah every prophecy fulfilled,--that Holy One, who has said in your litany, 'Turn to me, for in the day ye turn ye shall be saved.'" "We have Moses and the prophets, and abide by them," exclaimed the sick man, who had been listening attentively. "Salvation shall yet come to Mount Zion, and Israel inherit the earth." "Oh that the veil might indeed be taken away from God's chosen people, that they might enter into that inheritance which is eternal!" replied the doctor, in a low, impressive voice, at the same time placing his hand upon the wrist of his patient, whose pulse he found beating less rapidly than on the previous day, giving great encouragement that the violence of the fever was about being subdued. "Perfect quiet, Mrs. Hammet," said the doctor, as he was about leaving, " will do much towards your husband's res- toration. I think a favorable crisis is approaching." These soothing words and encouraging tones had already disposed Mr. Hammet to sleep. Carefully adjusting the pillows, his wife seated herself at one end of the apartment, and patiently watched his breathing, until she became con- vinced that he was in a profound slumber; then, with a heart lighter than it had been for several days, she left the   INTO THE LIGHT.          47'  room to give directions to Ruth, the faithful house-keeper, to prepare a cooling drink, in a way peculiar to the East, which she hoped might surprise her husband. She had scarcely left the chamber when the street door was softly opened, and a stealthy step ascended the stairs, and passed directly to the chamber of Mr. Hammet. Joseph Fleming, for it was he, paused a moment at the door, fearing that Naomi's presence might prevent the interview which he so much desired. Advancing at once to the bedside, he did not hesitate for a moment to arouse the unconscious sleeper, not believing that it was a genuine illness. A stormy interview ensued, and the fever, that was about subsiding, was again fanned, by excitement and passion, into a fire that coursed through the veins and mounted to the brain of Reuben Hammet, very soon producing delirium. Even the unfeeling heart of Fleming was touched with fear and slight remorse, as he beheld the tempest which he had called into being, and he left as suddenly and noiselessly' as he came. Mrs. Hammet was appalled, on her return, to hear the wild ravings of insanity, -her husband crying, "Be gone, fiend!" and then helplessly moaning, '"My daughter! my pearl! Oh, wait! wait! it shall not be, - poverty! starvation! O agony!" and then tears, blessed relief, allayed, in a de- gree, the arid desert of horror that seemed stretched inter- minably before him.. His wife placed her cool fingers upon his heated temples, and spoke soothing words, as she would to a tender infant. For a moment he yielded to her gentle influence, and then followed another paroxysm even wilder than before. Ben, the. colored servant, was despatched in great haste for Dr. Heber, while the distressed mother and daughter felt that every moment before his arrival was an age. "Mother, what can it mean?" whispered Naomi. "The doctor said that all his symptoms were encouraging."  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7355-00000026"/> 48         INTO THE LIGHT. "I cannot tell, my child; it is a mystery, this sudden and violent change. It seems to me there must have been some outward cause." "Can it be that this is Joseph Fleming's work?" said Naomi, while a shudder ran through her frame. "I thought I heard footsteps in the hall, after the doctor left." "Ask the servants, my dear," said her mother; " perhaps some one may know." Naomi did as she was requested, but no one had been seen, and they began to think their suspicion an unjust one. The arrival of the doctor brought a sensation of relief to the overtasked mind of Mrs. Hammet, as she watched him administer to his patient a composing draught. While he was listening to her description of the fearful change that had so suddenly taken place, he interrupted her with ominous gravity, - "Madam, this is not the usual phase of this disease; some injudicious treatment is the cause of all this." "We have been unable to tell, sir," replied Mnrs. Hammet. "We are not aware that any one has been allowed to enter the chamber." "Mother, where is Ben?" suddenly exclaimed Naomi. "It is possible that he may know, as he was not present when I questioned the other servants. He had gone, I be- lieve, for the doctor; " and she arose and rung the bell. "Ben," said his mistress, " was any one here this morn- ing after the doctor left?" "Oh, yes, ma'am! Mr. Fleming, he was here ; I saw him go up the stairs, and master he hollered very loud and very angry, and after that Mr. Joseph ran downstairs just as softly as a mouse, and went away very quick." "' That explains all," said the doctor, with an anxious shake of the head. "Great harm has been thoughtlessly done, but we will hope no fatal consequences may supervene. It will be necessary to have Mr. Hammet watched, as an- other paroxysm may return. He now appears more quiet,   INTO THE LIGHT.          49  n! possibly this attack may pass off without any further criebLral excitement;" and the doctor left, promising to call tain in the course of the day. Naomi began to feel a nervous dread and foreboding that some network of evil was being cast around her and those she loved. She grew very pale with excitement and indig- nation, and paced the room adjoining her father's chamber, a few moments, with restless steps. Then she spake words of comfort and encouragement to her mother, which found no answering echo in her own heart, lest she might increase in any way the trials which she instinctively felt would soon be hers, when the lonely lot of widowhood became her portion. Mrs. Hammet gave orders that the front door should be securely locked, so that the house could not again be entered with a latch-key. It had been Fleming's right and privilege, as he asserted, -to come and go as he pleased, often calling himself one of the family; and the young girl's once happy home had be- come almost distasteful to her, as she felt it invaded by a presence she had no power to expel while her father's will was supreme, and now she remembered sadly that he had himself tasted the first bitter fruits of selfish aims and sordid purposes.

He industriously circulated reports respecting Mr. Hamomet's business inter- ests, so that his creditors soon became alarmed and attempted to secure their claims; but, owing to the craftiness of Flem- ing, very little could be gained or learned respecting the once almost princely property of the Jew. WJhile this was. taking place, the sands of life were running low in the earthly career of Reuben Hammet, and mother and daughter were distressed and anxious spectators of the slow but steady wasting of his vital energies hour by hour. For the last few days his senses had returned, and his sub- dued gentleness of manner strongly recalled to!the mind of his wife the few brief happy hours spent in his society when he won her youthful heart by seeming the embodiment of every manly virtue. One day, as she sat beside him, he took her hand, kissed it with emotion, and murmured, "Too good for such as I." Still retaining his clasp of her delicate fingers, he saidcl,- "Rachel, do you remember the conversation we had before my illness in regard- to our daughter?" Mrs. Hammet gently pressed his hand in reply. "There was one thing you said at that time which I have striven in vain to forget. You spoke of sacrificing a human soul upon the altar of selfishness, and the fearful responsi- bility incurred hereafter. I begin to see my aims andt mo- tives in their true light. I cannot further urge our beloved child to do violence to her pure nature, by becoming the bride of Joseph Fleming. He never can be aught to me henceforth but a stranger. Should I recover, our paths will lie very different." "Bless you, O my father!" burst from the quivering lips of Naomi, who had entered unperceived and heard her father's words; (" truly you are restored to me, and will love me agtain. I have never, but in this one thing, opposed your wishes.!'   INTO THE LIGHT.         51 "You have ever been to me a true daughter," he replied; "and you, Rachel, a tender, faithful, uncomplaining wife; but how have I fulfilled my duty? Oh, what can atone for the irreclailnable past!" groaned the repentant man. "Live! live to bless us all!" was the tearful reply of Mrs. Hammet. "t If you knew all, perhaps you would not wish it," mourn- fully rejoined her husband. "t To my hardness of heart I have added the vice of gambling, and thy once fair patri- mony, as well as my own, has long since vanished; only the small legacy left by thy uncle remains. Can you forgive me, Rachel, thou dear one? How singular that the true beauty of thy nature has been, until now, but dimly perceived!" "Let not this distress you, Reuben; I have anticipated it all," said his wife; " we shall be far happier in your love than with all our former wealth." "Oh, if I could only be permitted to live long enough to prove to you my repentance! but I fear that privilege will never be mine," he feebly responded. "May the God of Israel grant it!" solemnly ejaculated both mother and daughter, who inwardly felt that there was great cause for alarm in the evidently sinking strength of the invalid. Shortly after this conversation, Mr. Hammct fell into an unquiet slumber, which lasted until the arrival of the doctor, who took every opportunity of conversing with the aged Israelite, hoping to awaken in him a desire for the salvation of his soul. He had no sooner entered the chamber than another visitor made his appearance, -a Rabbi of some dis- tinction, - who had always professed to be a fast friend of Mr. Hammet's, and who looked with an eye of suspicion upon Dr. Heber, as he greatly feared his proselyting zeal. Perceiving no immediate cause for alarm in the situation of his patient, the doctor, after a few careful directions, was taking his leave, when Rabbi Ben Zara, ever ready for a  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7355-00000028"/> 52        INTO THE LIGHT. tilt with his old adversary, detained him by saying that he had a question to ask. "Well, my friend," said the doctor, pleasantly, ", what'is it? You and I agree upon some points perfectly."  "In your Bible," replied Ben Zara, " we read that after the coming of the Messiah the tribes of the earth shall cease to mourn, and Israel's restoration shall be complete. Now, admitting for one moment that He who was called the     A Son of David, and whom you hold to be the Messiah, was such, why, then, is not our national restoration consummated? for you say that the Christian religion is the end of our law and the prophets."                      I "The Christian religion, my friend, is not separate from Judaism," replied the doctor, " if you would but see it right- ly; but the very vitality and soul which animate all that we both consider holy. Moses, the prophets, and the disciples of the Redeemer are indissolubly connected; one goldenll  spiritual chain uniting all. 'But the Shepherd of Israel came to his own, and his own received him not.' ' But the time draweth near when they shall look on Him whom they have pierced, and shall remember him in far countries, with their children, and shall turn again,' - and here and there, Ben Zara, throughout the earth, among our peculiar people,  G do we find the chosen few increasing, who are doubly Jews  . by virtue of their acceptance of the Holy One of Israel, and their acknowledgment that David, Isaiah, and the prophets were all Christians."  The mother and daughter sat listening with fixed attention until Mr. Hammet, to their surprise, exclaimed, - "  Dr. Heber, new and strange emotions have lately filled me with an indescribable longing to hear more of that Being whom you so love and worship." Breathing an inward prayer for divine wisdom to use aright the opportunity, thus unexpectedly presented, of un- folding some of the sublime truths of Christianity, the good physician proceeded, with great simplicity, to speak of the   INTO THE LIGHT.         53 wondrous schemne of man's salvation; the love of God in manires;ing himself to the world in the person of his Son; his sacrifice, land death; his almighty power, and the peace which those enjoy who love and trust him as their all- sufficient Saviour. "' All this, and more, shall be ours," said Mr. Hammet, musingly, " when the Messiah cometh; but the thought, doctor, is too dreadful to admit for one moment that we may be walking in blindness; for of what would our race be guilty? Well might they be wanderers and exiles from the land of their heritage, the city of our Prince and King." "Impossible!" exclaimed Ben Zara, who had risen and stood with one arm extended, seeming the very impersona- tion of the proud -Pharisee of old, of whom the Savioursaid, "neither would they believe though one rose from the dead." "' Mr. Hammet," he continued, " why speak of the possibil- ity of such a thing? Nothing will, nothing ever can, weaken the impregnable strongholds of our faith. The hidden meaning of our law is not revealed to all." ' But yet," interrupted'the doctor, " the word of God is said to be so plain that he who runs may read." "Ay," replied the Jew, with a sneer; "' but he who runs does not stop to read, it seems; if so, why are your prisons so well filled by those who violate the laws by homicides and crimes? How many Jews will you find as actors therein? I will venture to say nonie! Our Rabbinical teachers com- mand us to keep not only the letter but the spirit of the law, and we eschew that faith which rests upon creeds merely, without bringing  forth the ripe, golden fruit of a useful moral life. Verily, by men's works shall they be saved." "Just there, my friend," said the doctor, sadly, " you toulch upon one of the great sins of the Hebrew nation, pride, which makes them stubborn in unbelief, and bids them attempt to work out their own salvation by the deeds of the law. 'When the Jews came to the Divine Master with the question,' Rabbi, what shall we do, that we might work 5*  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7355-00000029"/> 54        INTO TIIE LIGTIT the works of God?' Jesus answered and said unto them, ' This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him whom he hath sent. " A frown gathered upon the really fine features of the  Israelite, as he remarked the evident interest of- the little family group in the remarks of the physician, and once he turned on his heel as if about to leave, when the frowningD  expression on his face gave place to one of absolute amaze-- ment and incredulity, as he heard Mr. Hammet refer to the New Testament, and say,-- "Without doubt it is impossible to judge correctly of any book without reading it, and I have many times resolved to read the New Testament thoroughly for my own satisfaction. For the Gentiles, Ben Zara, are certainly more tolerant than ourselves, for they bind part of our .laws with  their own." "I long as ardently for the cominig of the Messiah as any of my nation," he replied; " but that the Holy One of Jacob has yet walked the earth in human form, is to me an absurd story. Doctor Heber," he continued, " what chapter in your Scriptures gives the clearest evidence of this?" The doctor opened a sinall pocket Bible, which he always carried about with him, and read a few verses from the first chapter of John; pausing a moment at the fourteenth verse, ' The word was made flesh and dwelt among us," he said, - "Here is a reference to the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah." "Oh, yes, I know," interrupted Ben Zara, 1" you Gentiles always think with that chapter ill Isaiah you can overthrow and demolish the strong and stately structure of ancient Judaism; but praised be the God of Israel, our Mishna, or oral law, gives us a clear exposition of such passages. Twelve folio volumes of wisdom form a sufficient guide to those who desire to study our religion in its purity." "Friend Zara," said Mr. Hammet, "you have been a greater student than I of our Jewish doctrines, and can therefore better testify; but it has seemed to me at times   INTO THE LIGITT. that many parts are obscure, and some of them rmy raDpe:'r absurd; but I have always felt that was in consequence of not properly understanding them. All we want is truth." "Yes, verily," replied Ben Zara, '" without being per- verted by the puerile, inane fancies of the Nazarenes;" and, with a scornful curl of the lip and a slight, haughty inclina- tion of the head, the proud Jew took his departure. "There goes one of the pillars of our most holy faith+' said Reuben Hammet. Then, as if he repented of his temporary turning away from the creed of his fathers, he sighed deeply and murmured, "Oh that all could be equally zealous!"  Dr. Heber, apprehending his state of mind, refrained from agaain alluding to those topics of conversation which had evidently offended Ben Zara; but, as he was about to leave, there went up from his heart a fervent thanksgiving, as he observed the young Jewess in an attitude of deep thought, and felt that it was in the power of the Lord to cause even the few seeds of divine truth thus sown to germinate' in her soul, and bring forth fruit unto life eternal.      3 Unperceived, he laid his little clasped Testament upon the centre-table, as he passed out, well knowing that the clear intellect of Naomi, if once excited to profound thought upon religious subjects, would not be satisfied without a thorough investigation of the great principles of Christianity. There- fore, he left the key,--the only sure guide,-- committing the result into the hands of Him who ruleth and directeth all things. FSather," said Naomi, " our old friend, the doctor, has presented himself in a new light this morning, - somewhat in the character of a teacher. I confess, I was surprised at his boldness, and yet I could not help feeling deeply in- terested."  "True, daughter! They are bold who say aught against our holy religion. Friend Heber is a good man, however, although somewhat mistaken in his views. I must-say that  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7355-00000030"/> dor       INTO THE LOGHT., some of his remarks are worthy of consideration; for too long have many of our race been blindly led by the oral law without a personal investigation. Benealth all that-is called  Christianity, there may be--it is not impossible--a funda- mental truth." "Father," cried Naomi, suddenly, "I will find this truth,  if there is one ill the Christian's Bible! Surely, it canniot harm me."                          ; "I fear it is dangerous, my daughter; and yet I have had of late the same desire. My seclusion in this sick-chamber  has given my mind a wider and more upward range, and I feel the comparative hollowness of niany of our cerenollials,  and a strange longing to have my spirit filled with divine  i truth; and where, oh, where, can that be found?" At that moment, as if in answer to the question, Mrs. Hammet remarked, "I  am sorry the doctor has forgotten his Testament. I will lay it aside, until he comes agafin."  "Let me   have it a moment," said Naomi; and, as she took it, a little piece of white paper floatet from the leaves, and fell at her feet. When she stooped to pick it up, she  saw pencilled upon it, " 26th Chap. Matthew ;" and, turning  to that part of the New Testament, she soon became absorbed in the account of the sufferings of Jesus of Nazaretlh agonizing alone, amid the cedars of Gethsemane. And, as she read of his patient, loving, sorrowful expostulation, uttered over the sleeping forms of those who professed to love him,-- What, could ye not watch with me one hour?" -she was deeply moved; and when she reachled that point whfre the divine omniscience becomes manifest, ald He who readeth the hearts of men excused the outward signs )f neglect in his disciples, by these divine, comptassionate vords, "The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is we-al," uddenly, deep within her soul, the fountains of feeling vere unsealed, and the tears flowed freely, while the uni- elsal, electric chain of love, vibrating from the spirit's mluost shrine, up to the great Eternal, carried heavenward   INTO THE ILIGHT.          57 her first, involuntary, unconscious offering of faith, in the Hebrew's true Messiah. And, at that hour, she resolved to search the Scriptures, that she might understand more fully the doctrines of the Nazarenes. Her father lay watching the expressive changes of her countenance as she read, and when he saw her emotion, in- fluenced by curiosity and a compound of feelings, the nature of which he did not understand, he held out his hand for the book, as Naomi arose to answer her mother, who was calling from an adjoining apartment. Kissing the hand affection- ately that clasped the book, she left the sweet influence of her pure presence upon the spirit of her father, rendering him more than usually susceptible to the reception of light and truth. Long and earnestly did he read, and well was the faithful servant of Christ rewarded for his words spoken in season; for the Spirit of God had already begun to move over the dark chaos of his mind. Like the early morning dawn, a few faint rays of light be- gan to permeate and illume his darkened soul; and the time was not far distant when the Sun of Righteousness would arise, bathing in unclouded splendor his whole moral nature.

HORACE VINCENT had adhered strictly to his resolution of not going near the locality  where dwelt the charming  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7355-00000031"/> 58        INTO THE LIGUIT. Jewess; but still, thought was often busy with her sweet nemoory. At such times he would withdraw his mind from the fair vision which his fancy called up, and'would often visit the old homestead, and interest himself in his sister Laura's school exercises and compositions, - watching with delight her rapid progress and quick comprehension of every theme or study introduced. He had bidden her farewell one morning, however, feelings that she was in an unusually wayward humor, and not dis- posed to make an effort to please hinm in her recitations. As he closed the garden gate, the bell of the village academy, dignified by the name of L----  Institute, began to sound, and Laura exclaimed,- 1"Grace, now Horace is gone, I will tell you how I have made up mly mind. I shall not go to school this morning; I wish to leave altogether." "Why, Laura, you surprise me! What is your reason for so strange a resolution?" "Because Julia Carrington is so insolent that I cannot stay where she is! She takes every opportunity to trouble me, when she knows no one but myself will notice her. You remember the beautiful inkstand which Horace gave me for ' my desk? She broke that, yesterday, on purpose to vex me. I had taken it out, in order to wipe off the dust, when she arose, and asked permission to borrow a Latin diction- ary. This was against one of the rules; but Mr. Harper lets the heiress of Briarwood Hall transgress sometimes without reproof. He nodded assent. She crossed the room, and approached my desk, saying, 'Shall I borrow your dictionary, Miss Vincent?' And, before I had time to answer, she swept it off, and the inkstand with it, which fell and broke in a dozen pieces." "Of course, it was an accident," said Grace. "Not at all, my sister; for she turned away from me, suddenly, and said, ' Mr. Harper, can you forgive my sad carelessness?' without deigning to offer me a word of   INTO THE LIGHT.        .  59 apology! Thus, my loss and my feelings were alike dis- regarded." 'You are not sure, Laura, dear, that it was purposely done."  "Was it an accident, Grace, when slihe stepped upon my , new dress, and I had to come home with the breadth torn across? At the same time, she said to Emma Hall, point- ing at mly torn skirt, and laughig, 'Pride must have a fall!' She has behaved in this way for about two months." "Is there no cause," asked Grace, I' for such conduct?" "Well, she had not been at school long, before it was pretty generally known that she was a great .dunce, and would be at the foot of every class. Mr. Harper, one day, praised my application, and reproved her indolence, at the same time telling me to take my place above her; and, since that time, she has been my enemy, and I will not bear it any longer! I do not mean to go to school again, while Julia Carrington remains!" and the slender figure straightened, and the dark eyes flashed with a determined spirit. "Laura," said Grace, earnestly, while her fine blue eyes filled with tears, " you love me, do you not? but yet you have grieved me by this ungentle spirit." In a moment, Laura's arms were around her sister's neck. Still, she again asserted her determination to leave school. "Let us, clear sister, look at the matter calmly. Have you ever tried to make Julia Carrington your friend?" "No; because I do not wish it!" ,' Never madcle an effort to overcome her ill-will by kind- ness or forbearance?" inquired Grace, affectionately. "No! Why should I?" said Laura, as the color deep- ened on her cheek. "Canl my mother's daughter ask such a question," said Grace, -!" why she should 'return good for evil'? Laura, you know what I wish my daily life to be, and from whence I draw my rules of conduct?" "From the Bible," said Laura, more gently. "And now, my dear sister," she continued, "if you will l  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7355-00000032"/> Go(       INTO THE LIGHT. take mny advice, and follow its directions for one week, you shall, at the end of that time, leave school', with mv con- sent, if you desire it. Remember, Julia Carrington had no mother's care in her childhood, as we had, and the influences about her were not calculated to develop a pleasing char- acter. What I want you to do, my darling, is to seek an opportunity, this day, in some way, to do her a favor. TXry to overcome evil with good. If it is unnoticed, never minld; you cannot expect to elicit good feeling at once. Do by her precisely as you would wish another to do by you. Try to follow out this rule, in every respect, for one day, even, and you will be surprised, I am sure, at the result." Laura seemed half persuaded, but not being convinced, she still hesitated. "If our mother were here, what would she say, dear? Would it not be forget and forgive, and show by your ac- tions that you forgive? ' An appeal to her mother's memory seldom failed to decide Laura rightly; but Grace used this persuasion but seldom, fearing to weaken its power. Laura's ingenuous nature felt that her sister was right and her duty plain. She gathered up her books without any more hesitation, and was soon equipped and on her way, feeling light-hearted once more. For even one good resolution has an effect to tranquillize the mind by the mental effort to overcome the evil within. She had not proceeded far, when she heard her name called, and, turn- ing, perceived Lucy Somers, with wild Belle Manning, who cried, - - ' Laura, what is going to happen?  There is Domine walking with Julia Carrington." '"Why, Belle, who is it that you are talking about?" said Laura. -' Pedagogue Harper, to be sure," said Belle, laughing, whose organ of veneration was sadly deficient, and who did not care much what she said, if she only excited a smile. "So much for the nice suppers he gets at Briarwood Hall;   INTO THE LIGHT.         61 they supply the bodily aliment, while he administers the mental; the latter being much the harder task of the two. Laura, did you ever see such an ignoramus as Julia? I saw that manceuvre when she broke your inkstand just after the Latin recitation; and I felt so vexed, - you have no idea, - when I saw her andc Mary Mason laughing behind their maps afterward. I'll pay her if I get a chance!" "Now, Belle, don't! promise me, won't you? Some time I may tell you why," said Laura, earnestly, whose better feelings had all returned directly, as she resisted the tempta- tion to join in her censorious remarks. "Well, I won't, then," said Belle, " if you are serious about it; but remember, some time I am to know." Lucy Somers had walked leisurely along beside them without any comment; but now Laura felt her hand upon her shoulder, and there beamed upon her a sweet, approving smile, that told her she was understood by the friend she most esteemed at school. Lucy Somers was one of those lovely, quiet characters, who constantly exercise a pure and healthful influence upon the minds of those with whom they associate, and of which they themselves are scarcely aware; and therefore Laura en- tered the school-room without any of the revengeful feelings which had distressed and harassed her mind the day previ- ous. She thought of Julia Carrington as a motherless girl, and not as the haughty but ignorant heiress, and pity filled her with more tender and charitable feelings. It was well that she was so strengthened, for her good resolutions were to be severely tried. Laura had a few minutes to study before recitation, and repeated her lesson without a mistake. During recess there was much whispering and short bursts of laughter between Julia and her friend, Mary Mason. While they were walking in the grounds, little Agnes Ray, the child of a poor woman whom Laura had furnished with clothes and a few necessaries from time to time, came up, and, dropping an awkward cour- 6  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7355-00000033"/> 62        INTO THE LIGHT.                tesy, handed her a little red needle-book, upon which the little creature had been at work a long time, as an offering  to her young' benefactress. Laura took it with a smile, and exclaimed, - "Thank you! oh, thank you! What nice little stitches!"  The child's face and neck crimsoned, and, clapping her hands for joy, she cried,- "I made it all myself!" Then suddenly remembering that there were others observing her, she sprang away, and   t was soon seen running across the fields like a little brown sparrow, as happy and as innocent. "What an affecting sight!"  said Julia Carrington. Really, Miss Vincent acts the lady charitable to perfec-   V tion! Was this little scene got up for our especial edifica-  ) tion?"  Laura's cheek burned, and she was about to make an indig-  I nant reply; but rememlbering her resolution, she turned and walked quickly away. Imnnmediately upon entering the school-room the young ladies were called to bring their written Latin exercises to Mr. Har- per for examination. Laura opened her desk, and as she raised the book, a small gold pencil fell from between the leaves. Surprised, she hastily laid it aside for the moment, and, without again looking at her lesson, stepped forward with the others and laid it upon the master's desk. Upon going back to her seat, she took up the pencil with some curiosity, and saw engraved upon the side the initials J. C. At that mo- ment the master's bell rang for silence, with a quick, nervous peal. Each eye was directed towards him; for there was a dark fiown upon his brow, and an unusual glow of anger upon his cheek, as he said,- 1' Miss Laura Vincent will come forward." There was a marked severity in his tone, as he continued. "Miss Vin- cent, you are charged with a misdemeanor; first, in trans- gressing the rules by scrilbblinC upon your exercise-book, and next, for showing disrespect to your teacher."   INTO THE LIGHT.           u Astonishment and indignation rendered Laura, at first, speechless; and then; in the power of conscious innocence, she raised her eyes with a brave look to his face, and an- swered, -- "I am not guilty, sir, of either charge." "No?" he said. "What means this?" and opening her book, he pointed to a page where he had corrected her lesson and signed his name. Immediately over the name was skil- fully drawn a donkey's head. Laura, rendered excited and nervous by those unjust accu- sations, no sooner saw the long ears and the grotesquely turned-up eyes of the donkey, than she was seized with an irresistible desire to laugh, which was quickly succeeded by a passionate burst of tears. "Miss Vincent," said the teacher, sternly, "I can forgive the insult, but you must suffer the usual penalty for defacing your book. Your station now is at the foot of your class." Laura returned to her desk bewildered, without the power to utter a syllable. She sat there for some time, her ftac concealed by her long curls, until she grew more composed. At last her eye fell upon the pencil she had found, and the whole truth stood clearly revealed, - that it was Julia's property, and a malicious attempt to bring her into disgrace. Tile first impulse was to rise and announce before the whole school how the pencil was found, and to whom it belonged, and let them draw their own conclusions. But pure influ- ences stole gently and sweetly around her heart while she hesitated, and seemed to whisper, "It is noble to forgive; " and her resolution was taken, and the evil suggestions were conquered and took their flight, leaving her calm and strong. Quietly she took her stand at the foot of the class, and went through her recitation with a serenity that surprised cven herself. In the mean time, Julia Carrington had missed her pencil, and, apprehending where it was, felt in momentary expecta-  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7355-00000034"/> "        INTO THE LIGHT. tion of an exposure; while she cast insolent glances upon Laura, pretending to be wholly indifferent. The hour passed, and the session closed, to her great re- lief, without a word from Laura. This filled her with aston- ishment, and she conjectured that Mr. Harper was to hear th e whole story in private. But no! Laura was among the first to pass out into the vestibule. Several of the girls were i in waiting, talking about the scenes of the morning. One or two called after Laura as she passed, but the brave girl, strong in a determined purpose, seemed not to helar; and, instead of going directly towards home, turned up a short   ! lane, and, crossing into Lime Street, pulrsued her way alone until she stood beneath the noble trees that skirted the parkl  attached to I Briarwood H-all." Here she waited until Julia made her appearance, knowing that Mary Mason usu- ally wallred most of the way home wiit11 her, and she wished to see her alone. WhVen she came in sight, Laura went for- watrd to meet her. Julia looked at first surprised, and then !  provolied, while a conscious blush burned upon her cheek as  I the youngw girl held out her pencil, saying, -  ' Miss Carrincton, I found this within the leaves of my exercise-book; is it not yours?" "Well, what if it may be?" said Julia, with a scornful toss of the head. "I did not wish to return it before any one, and so I came here for that purpose,' said Laura, gently. Julia's large black eyes opened wide with astonishment, and she exclaimed,- "Do you mean to say that no one in school knows that you have that pencil?" "No one," replied Laura. "And what may be your motive for being thus generous?" "Because," said Laura, with a bright, frank smile, which it seemed impossible to resist, " a friend is worth more than an enemy." And she hesitated a moment, lest she might seem to reprove; and the smile was succeeded by a thought-   INTO THE LIGHT.         o0 fnl, tender expression, as she continued:  "My mother taught me to forget any unkindness in another, and remem- ber only teir good qualities. We are both motherless, Julia; why should we be enemies?" Julia's better nature, that had- so long slumbered, now seemed thoroughly roused. "Laura Vincent, you are a noble girl " she exclaimed, with animation. "ForgivO tlc past. Accept me for a frielAd, and you shall never lav.-e cause to repent your ehoice." Laura's hand was extended before she had finished, ald in that warim clasp there seemed to be transferred into her conm- panion a portion of her own lovinhg spirit; for Julia's rather plain features were irradiactld with the pure and unusual emotions that were stirring witlin her. The two young ogirls walked a few paces hand in hland, an( when they parted, Julia lhesitate:d a moment and then spoke fiankly. "I know very well what I ought to (do, Laura,-tell Mr. Harper, of course." "Not for my sake," said Laura, " but because-" "Because it would be right," rejoined Julia. "Yes, I know verv well wh1at you would do in my place, but I can- not yet. Still, you must be my friend, and, in time, I may become more generous." Laura turned towards home with a happy smile upon her lips, yet not aware that she had matured and strengthened her character by that short conflict and victory over the natural inclinations of the human heart. Site did not know -hy, but the sun seemed brighter, the sky wore a deeper blue, and the surrounding objects seemed to possess a more peaceful rural beauty. This hastily formed friendship was destined to lead to im- portant results in the future interests of both Laura and Grace. Ilome was soon reached, and at the door she espied her sister Grace, who had felt uneasy at not seeing her at the 6* sx  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7355-00000035"/> "        INTO THE LIGHT. accustomed hour. But one glance at her sweet, sunny face seemed to allay every fear. "Why, Laura darling, where have you been?" "Under the trees at Briarwood Hall," replied Laura, smiling. "Indeed! what sent you there?" "I hardly know how I came there; it seems almost like a dream. Come in, and I will tell you." Laura had an attentive listener, while she related the events of the morning; withoutreverting to her own distress and mortification,--which Grace, however, fully understood, knowing well her sensitive nature, - she passed to the final scene of reconciliation, while her sister. turned away to hide the tears which mingled emotions of gratitude and joy had called forth. A few words of commendation, judiciously bestowed, were all that Grace trusted herself to say; but fervent and joyful was the thanksgiving which ascended, when alone, from her heart to heaven, that this dear one, committed to her as a sacred trust, should begin to develop into a true and beauti- ful character, like that mother's, whose precious memory seemed ever as a talisman against evil.

Naomi instantly raised the curtains, and the mellow light of the setting sun streamed across the crimsbln damask dra- pery, which shaded the bed on which the sick man lay, and rested upon his brow, revealing his fine features, lighted up with a peculiarly chastened, humble, yet serene expression. The faithful teachings of the good doctor had been abun- dantly blessed to the soul of the aged Israelite; for it was indeed the word of God which lay open before him, and he had been drinking deeply from the fountain of all wisdom, strength, and peace. In the patient victim upon Calvary, he beheld the "Desire of nations, " the divine King of Israel. The spiritual presence of Him who once walked the earth in bodily form had revealed to him a risen Saviour, and, trust- ing in his atonement only, he calmly awaited the hour when his ransomed soul would rejoice with Abraham and Isaac, in the kingdom of God. "Can you not let me have more light, Rachel? I cannot see," he again exclaimed, while his breath came in short res- pirations, and he reached forth his hand to meet the tender clasp of his wife.!"Dear ones, faithful and true, I am blest beyond expression! Mount Zion! Jerusalem! PRedeemed through Christ! O wife! O daughter! there is salvation in none other. He is our own Messiah. Oh, believe--"His lips continued moving, but gave forth no sound. A bright gleam passed across his features, and he lay motionless. The spirit of the converted Jew had passed into the New Jerusa- . lem, into that glorious temple where the Lamb is the light thereof. For some moments the mother and daughter remained silent, awed by the solemn presence of death. Then mem- ory coursed swiftly over the scenes of the past, and every kind deed, or fond word spoken, was brought vividly before  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7355-00000036"/> 68        INTO TME LIGHT. the mind, while his faults and his sternness were all forgotten. Clasped in each other's arms for a long time, they wept together. Naomi was the first to speak. "Mother, this is a glorious faith by which to die. Would that I could understand it!" "It is to me mysterious and incomprehensible," said Mrs. Hammet; "but the Christian's Bible has been his guide. Only two days since he called me to his side, and, point- ing to the history of a Jew called Thomas, who cried out in the presence of Jesus of Nazareth, 'My Lord, and my God!' he said, while his eyes filled with tears, 'Rachel, this is my song of emancipation; may it also be yours. " At that moment the good doctor entered, and reverently approached the bed, where lay all that was mortal of his aged friend; and, after gazing steadfastly a moment, he exclaimed, - "A peaceful death! A glorious immortality beyond! All through faith in Him who cleanses from every sin." He then inquired concerning his last moments, and when Naomi had finished her tearful recital, he remarked,- "Surely freedom has come to the children of Israel, for the Lord hath said, ' I will bring thy sons from afar, and thy daughters from the ends of the earth.' " "My dear friend," he continued, addressing Mrs. Hammet, "in this your hour of sorrow you do not realize the peculiar blessing which has entered your dwelling; but I trust that when time has assuaged the first bitterness of grief, the ' true light' will dawn upon your soul, and you will apprc-. hend those divine truths, which have made your husband firee indeed. Permit me now to take the direction of all necessary arrangements. Do not have the slightest care; everything shall be done as you would wish." Mrs. Hammet was inexpressively gratified by his thoughts ful kindness, and could only weep her thanks.   INTO THE LIGHT.         69 An unusual sound of loud talking and laughing, in the room below, filled them with wonder and alarm. Ben at that moment came in crying wildly, - ' O mistress, they are appraising the furniture, three rough-looking men,  and Mr. Fleming, he is with them, telling them what to do." "He is n6t aware of the death of Mr. Hammet, I pre- sume," said the doctor. "Be composed, dear madam, and while you retire to your chamber, I will see that all is quiet." Descending quickly, he encountered the spare form and lowering visage of the Jew about ascending the stairs. Somewhat abashed at meeting Dr. Heber, in whose presence he always felt his inferiority, he inquired for his uncle. "He is quite free from pain at present; you can see him if you like," and the doctor turned and preceded him into the chamber of death. Parting the curtains, he revealed to his astonished gaze the pallid features and inanimate form of him whom he had so deeply wronged. Fear, remorse,  and a feeling of mortification struggled for mastery in the' breast of Joseph Fleming, as he observed the calm, cold eye of the doctor fixed upon him. "I was not aware of this," he muttered. "I presume not," said the doctor; " no one could be so lost to all natural feeling. Let me advise you to stop all further proceedings until after my friend's wife and daugh- ter are removed." "Your advice, sir, is quite superfluous," said Joseph, " as it will have no influence whatever on my movements. I shall, for the present, however, delay any further action; at least, until after my uncle's funeral. In the mean time, it would be well for his widow and daughter to consider that I am the arbiter of their future fortunes." "In what way, Mr. Fleming?" said the doctor. "I believe," he replied, " that I can show that I am sole proprietor of Mr. Hammet's effects, having bought out all his creditors." \  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7355-00000037"/> 70        INTO THE LIGHT. "And expected to have bought the daughter alo," said the doctor with a slight sneer. "If I mistake not, Miss H-Iammet possesses accomplishments and a character that will render her independent in any position in life. I think that her native dignity and good sense will not permit her to hesitate one moment in exerting herself for her own and her mother's support." "That would hardly be likely," retorted Fleming, as they passed out into the hall. "A girl like her, brought up inl affluence, accustomed to have every fancy gratified, and everyv want supplied, would not be disposed to choose poverty and toil, in preference to a princely establishment of her own." Disgusted at the conversation, the doctor made no reply, and they parted as he called to the faithful Ben and directed what should be done for his mistress' comfort; " and remem- ber," he continued, " :Mr. Fleming has no right here until after the funeral." Ben gave an intelligent look and said, "Yes, sir, you can trust me for that." Satisfied that it would be best to leave the afflicted ones undisturbed in the privacy of their chamber, the doctor refrained firom attempting to offer any further consola- tion, although his strong, vigorous mind had rapidly de- vised a plan by which Naomi might obtain an honorable independence. In the mean time, a prey to a thousand conflicting emo- tions, the fair Jewish maiden sat in the sumptuous apart- ment -which she herself had furnished according to the dictates of her own exquisite taste, and mentally bade adieu to the splendor around her, to all that she had once enjoyed. She resolutely tried to banish all vain regrets for the wealth shew about to relinquish, and looked bravely forward into the future, to a life of toil and patient endurance. She thought of herself as a music-teacher; but where could she obtain pupils? and then as a governess; but where could she   INTO  TH   LIGHT. *1 obtain a situation? Both present and future seemed shrouded in uncertainty and gloom. "So bitter is the cup of life, we fain would drink no more, ' Oh, let this cup but pass from me I ' in anguish we implore; But days and months, and years roll on, and lo I 'tis asked atlength, When was it that our souls put on new majesty and strength I CHAPTER XII.

THE last sad rites had been performed, and the remains of Joseph Hammet rested in the costly tomb of his fathers. The few friends who had followed him to the grave had all departed, leaving that vague, unsatisfied, mournful feeling impossible to describe, which pervades the mind immediately after we have laid away forever a loved and familiar form. Naomi sat a long time in a sorrowful revery. At length, feeling that she was too much absorbed in her own emotions, to the neglect of her mother, she hastened into her presence and found her sad, but composed, reading the Jewish lesson of the day. She laid aside her book as Naomi entered, and before she spoke, gazed a moment upon her sweet face with anxious tenderness. "My daughter, it is best to look misfortune in the face, is it not? We cannot remain here; self-respect forbids it." !"I know that, mother; not another hour do I wish to be sheltered by aught that belongs to Joseph Fleming." "How could he think," said Mrs. Hammet, " that you would accept him as a lover, when you have ever manifested your aversion?"  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7355-00000038"/> 72        INTO THE LIGHT. "I believe, mother, it is partially a feeling of revenge that prompts him; love it cannot be; he does not seem capa- ble of a true affection. I have not told you of our interview this morning?" ' No," replied her mother, earnestly. '"I had hoped this day, at least, might be free from all intrusion." "I had been," said Naomi, " to look once more on those dear, still features so beautiful in their last repose, and as I gazed, a sweet serenity pervaded my whole being, snch as I had not known for months. I felt that he was unspeakably happy, and in that thought all our cares and perplexities were forgotten, and I seemed to hold sweet communion with the sainted dead. Rudely was I awakened from this peace- ful dream by the voice of Joseph Fleming, who pretended that he wished once more to behold the features of his uncle. "' Dear cousin Naomi,' he said, in a low, insinuating tone, 'surely at such an hour as this we might be friends.' "'Friends!' I replied, while I felt the indignant blood mount to my temples; ' even my friends would hesitate to obtrude in this way upon the privacy of our great sorrow.' "' Neither would I,' he rejoined, 'had there been any hope of an interview anywhere else; for I felt sure that I should find you here. You have constantly avoided me, and it pains me deeply, loving you as I do' - "' Silence, sir! ' I exclaimed; ' the sanctity of this room should not thus be violated! It is useless for you to address such language to me, for I have no hesitation in saying that your conduct in the past, and at this hour, has been such, that I cannot look upon you with any other feeling than that of contempt.' "' Very well, my fair lady,' he answered, while a mocking smile curled his lips; ' this language would suit a queen, but not a pauper ' "Then it was that he felt the power of a strong will. I turned slowly as he ceased speaking, and when my calm and   INTO THE LIGHT.          73 sorrowful gaze flashed full upon him, he actually cowered, aind, as I said, 'You will be so kind as to leave the room, sir,' he seemed touched, for the moment, with a sense of shame, and, taking up his hat, without another word hastily retreated." "Naomi, my dear child," said her mother, sadly, " there must not be a repetition of such scenes! Let us leave here at the earliest possible moment. Hand me that casket, dear, which stands upon the bureau; we are not utterly bereft of everything; there is yet remaining in my own right a trifle." Naomi obeyed, and her mother took from her pocket a key, and, opening it, unfolded a letter which contained a notice of the legacy of a thousand dollars, bequeathed to her da by her maternal uncle, ten years previous, and saw that Mr. Hammet had written on the back the names of the parties who had received, and were using and paying interest for the money. He had invested it securely for her, with the vague idea, perhaps, that she might need it 'some day. "This will save us from absolute want," cried Naomi. "We can obtain board in a humble home, and I will seek a situation where I can make my hitherto useless acquirements available." "It will be best to leave everything, only taking our ap- parel," said Mrs. Hammet; " and Dr. Heber (almost our only friend) will see if anything remains." "How singular that our own people should be so very vindictive!" said Naomi, thoughtfully; " because my father was converted to the Christian faith, nearly all deserted him in his last moments. The Rabbis say that he was an apos- tate, and I feel almost persuaded to become one myself, I    when I remember the wondrous change which took place in all the sentiments and feelings of my dear father. I shall not rest until I have more fully studied the new oracles, and compared them with the law and the prophets." ' I have not yet felt a desire for aught but those writings which are sanctioned by the Hebrew faith," replied Mrs. Hammet.

My child, now that we are thus chastened let us put away every thought contrary to the religion of our fathers.') "But, mother, I can no longer trust blindly to the Talmud. I delight to read the beautiful imagery of Isaiah, which my father said was fully explained in the New Testament, and which I also dimly perceive when I read." The conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Ben, the servant, who said Dr. Heber was waiting to see them below. Glad to see their friend and counsellor, they eagerly went to meet him, and found him accompanied by his wife. "Good-morning, ladies," said the doctor, in a bright, cheerful tone; " my wife thinks she is a better diplomatist than myself, so I took her into partnership this morning on a little matter of business." An amused smile flitted for an instant over the fine face of Mrs. Heber; and she was about to reply in the same merry manner; but her sensitive woman's nature felt that just then and there it was not in harmony with the depressed spirits of the mourners. Really feeling a deep sympathy, it was instantly apprehended by them, and her words of kindness had a peculiarly soothing effect upon the mind of Mrs. Hammet. After some conversation, Naomi alluded to her great desire to leave their present residence, indirectly giving reasons which were quickly understood. Mrs. Heber replied (calling her attention to the principal object of their visit), "Miss Hammet, my husband being necessarily absent much of the time, I am in want of a friend and companion whose society will relieve my loneli- ness. Will you be that friend, dear girl, and make our house your home?" There was so earnest and sincere an expression in her soft eyes, that Naomi felt the offer was dictated by the purest friendship, but still she could not consent to live thus upon the bounty of others. Her refusal was sweetly and touch-   INTO THE LIGHT.         75 ingly expressed, but firmly withal, so that Mrs. Heber could not but admire the noble spirit of independence which so promptly put aside any temptation to inactivity and ease. Mrs. Heber looked and felt disappointed, but presently said, "Are you fond of children, Miss Hammet?" "Yes," replied Naomi; " all children are beautiful to me, and among my many dreams and hopes for the future, the thought of becoming a teacher has presented to my mind the most pleasing aspect." "Ah," said Mrs. Heber, (" it was only yesterday that my husband, during a professional visit in a wealthy family, heard them making inquiries for a governess, and not feeling as hopeful as I did that our home would be gladdened by your presence, told them that possibly a young friend of his might wish for the situation. The Armstrongs are rather pleasant people, and the children are very engaging. They have two daughters-twins-  and one son; the doctor says he is a lovely boy. Mrs. Armstrong was a school- friend of mine, and if time has not changed her greatly, you will find her - although rather a selfish person - easy to a fault. Her husband thinks more of money-making than anything else; still, my dear Miss Hammet, if you really choose to teach, it might possibly prove a pleasant home." Naomi's eyes were suffusedl with tears, and she paused a moment ere she answered, affected by mingled emotions; the prospect of instant relief thus offered was so sudden and unexpected, while the kind interest manifested touched her deeply. 'i Most gladly, dear madam, would I undertake such a task if they would be willing to receive one who has had no experience in the tuition of children." At that moment Mrs. Hammet approached, and Naomi told her in a few words of Mrs. Heber's kind offer, and her feeling that she must decline such goodness; also of her wish to apply for the situation of governess. All the pride of her race and nation, all the high-bred ex-  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7355-00000040"/> 76        UNTO TE  LIGHT. clusiveness of Mrs. Hammet's previous life, arose in arms against such a measure, as she thought of her only daughter seeking a subordinate position in a Gentile family, and she urged a little delay with great earnestness. "But, mother," said Naomi, tenderly, as she rested her hand for a -moment, with a caressing movement, on her shoulder; "do you not remember our conversation last evening? How'many plans we laid for the future, none of which presented so favorable an aspect as this which Dr. Heber offers! I would rather not lose the opportunity by delay, and should like to apply at once, - can I not?" "I know," replied Mrs. Hammet, sadly, " that I ought to meet the exigencies of our situation with more firmness, in- stead of throwing obstacles in your way. I also should be 'up and doing, with a heart for any fate.' If you really think it best, my daughter, I will offer no further opposition." The doctor and his wife, although standing a little apart, had not been indifferent listeners to the conversation, and Mrs. Heber exclaimed, as they approached, - "Doctor, I shall begin to place more reliance than ever, if possible, on your impressions; you were not half so san- guine of my success as I was, and, of course, I feel propor- tionately disappointed in Miss Hammet's decision not to make our house her home; still I cannot but approve the course she is about to take." "I also share in your regrets," replied her husband; "still we wish to have our young friend do that which will make her the happiest. If you like," he continued, address- ing Naomi, "I will take you, to-morrow, in my carriage and introduce you to Mrs. Armstrong." Naomi gratefully assented, and the doctor and his wife took their leave with an increased respect and admiration for the beauty of the young girl's character thus revealed to them under such trying circumstances.   INTO THE LIGHT.         " The mother and daughter passed the day without being again molested by the presence of Joseph Fleming, although once they heard the familiar click of the latch-key introduced in the door, and, afterward, retreating footsteps convinced them that he had been successfully foiled in an attempt to obtain an entrance. That circumstance only. served to hasten still more their final arrangements. The long tried and faithful servants were discharged, -not without mani- festing much emotion when told they could no longer be permitted to serve those who had always been so considerate of their comfort and thoughtful of their feelings. Ben cried like a child when Mrs. Hammet paid a quarter's wages in advance, and, putting back the money, offered to stay with them without any compensation. Those duties, so trying and so painful, were -at last ended, and the rest of the day was devoted to the collecting and arranging of their own personal effects. At times the swift, painful thought would cross the mind that it was the last day they would ever spend in their beautiful home, and it re- quired all the stoicism of character they possessed to receive the idea with calmness. Naomi had finished her evening reading, which contained some lofty Hebrew poetry from the Lamentations of Jere- miah, with a feeling of unsatisfied thirst, which-brought a more intense craving for unclouded light and truth than she had yet known, while those words of sorrowful entreaty and expostulation, as if pleading with an angry Deity, moved FIrs. Hammet so deeply that she bowed her head, weeping bitterly, and repeated a line which her daughter had just read, "Rise up with thy mercy, O God of Israel, and compassionate us!" Here, again, the younger and stronger nature came to the rescue, and, in bright, cheerful tones, Naomi cried, "Let us cease grieving, mother dear, for that which cannot be helped. We have much left to be grateful for. Listen to this com- forting thought from a little book Dr. Heber loaned me,- 7*  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7355-00000041"/> 78        INTO THE LIGHT. "' God is good, when he gives,- supremely good; The same, when he denies.'" And she bent over her and kissed the drooping lids lovingly, until she raised her head and smiled hopefully through her tears, feeling that her greatest earthly treasure still re- mained. The following morning, the doctor, true to his appoint- ment, called, and, on handing Naomi into the carriage, said, with feeling, "Do not look so sober, my dear young lady; remember the old truism, 'Every cloud has its silver lining,' and that often 'After darkest night, comes flushed with rosy light the laughing morning.'" She smiled, faintly; but so new, so strange, was the errand upon which she was bent, that it seemed like a be- wildering dream, until the carriage stopped, and the doctor's pleasant face and encouraging tone roused her to new ex- ertion. A residence- handsome, but not as -rich as her own was designated as that of lIr. Armstrong. Before they reached the upper step, the door was thrown open, and the servant obsequiously took her card, at the same time show- ing them into a richly furnished drawing-room. Some moments elapsed before Mrs. Armstrong entered, and the young girl had time to collect her thoughts and re- sume her self-command. Then a rustle of silk announced her approach, and a lady entered, rather below the medium height, slightly inclined to corpulency, with a certain constrained dignity and haugh- tiness of manner, which seemed strangely at variance with a nervous winking of the eyelids whenever she commenced speaking, and a restless twirling of the corner of the point- lace handkerchief she carried in her hand. A rich wine. colored moire antique silk dress swept the carpet in a long trail, bordered by a wide band of velvet, a shade or two darker than the dress, which passed up the front breadth and spread over the shoulders, forming a demi-bertha, the   INTO THE LIGHT.         79 edge of which was trimmed with tiny golden bells that tinkled as she moved, and seemed to afford intense satisfac- tion to the wearer, who was thus constantly reminded of her costly adornments; and, although over-dressed to receive a morning call, she could not lose the opportunity of making a decided impression, through mere externals, upon the young governess, enough of whose previous life she had learned from Dr. Heber to awaken a desire for display. The soil of a naturally good mind had become overgrown with the fri- volities of a selfish, easy, and luxurious life, and, although she did not think long or seriously on any subject, yet she had a vague idea that it was important that a competent governess should take the place of the superficial French teacher (Miss Lascelles), who professed to be a superior scholar, and yet could not speak her own language correctly. After the necessary introduction and explanation had taken place, the doctor took leave, saying that Naomi would see him again, in F-- Square, in the course of the after- noon. Mrs. Armstrong- surveyed with some surprise the elegant- looking girl in deep mourning before her, and, unconsciously, grew more courteous, as she inquired, "Is it your pur- pose, Miss Hammet, to become a governess? Dr. Heber has told me of your reverses, and I hope that we have at last found what we have so long desired, - one who will care for our children's manners, as well as their education." "You are doubtless aware, Mrs. Armstrong, that I am quite a novice in teachiing, having no experience whatever, and that I can but trust to my natural tact and real love for children, to prompt and guide me in my efforts to instruct. You have two little girls and one son at home, I under- stand?" "Yes," replied Mrs. Armstrong. "My daughters, Ga- brielle and Gazelle, are twins; but Gazelle is lame, owing to the carelessness of her nurse in infancy, and is much more delicate in health and smaller in stature than her sister.. She  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7355-00000042"/> 80        INTO THE LIGHT. is painfully sensitive in regard to her lameness; but has not used a crutch for nearly a year. She will give you very little trouble, is fond of her books, and has already mastered the elementary principles of music. Gabrielle you will find a little untamed; but, in her wildest frolics, a word or a look is sufficient to make her quiet and gentle. Otis is an inde- pendent little fellow, with a strong will of his own; but, if you gain his affections, you can govern him, I think, without difficulty. Do you think you can undertake such a task, Miss Hammet? The salary shall be satisfactory." "Most willingly, Mrs. Armstrong, if you desire it," re- plied Naomi, hardly aware that she had entered upon a busi- ness engagement that would be binding. A few minutes more passed in conversation, and Naomi left, agreeing to commence her new duties the following week. She was not long in returning to the place she no longer considered her home, where she found her mother, surrounded by the trunks which contained their apparel, evidently making preparations for a hasty departure. In answer to her daughter's surprised look of inquiry, she said,- "Our good friend, Dr. Heber, called earlier than he antic- ipated, on his way to visit a patient, after he left you, and we have planned and executed promptly. A comfortable boarding-place has been obtained, by his advice, in the family of Isaac Nathans, a Jew, whom your father befriended in the days of his prosperity, and who seemed glad to make any return, treating me, during my call, with the greatest re- spect. You remember Mrs. Nathans, Naomi, do you not?" "Oh, yes! She once ruffled a skirt for me, and the work was so neatly'executed that I gave her ten dollars, instead of the five she charged, because I knew that it was done in the midst of many household cares, and I liked to encourage her ambitious industry. If I remember right, her house, al- though humble, is neatness itself." "That is true," continued Mrs. Hammet. "We can have   INTO THE LIGHT.          81 her best chamber, and at once; for no preparation was needed. Everything was in order, as you supposed, and the aspect of the house gives one a sense of the harmonious ad- justment of trifles, even, that imparts a quiet, home-like feeling that we might seek for in vain in a less orderly and more pretentious residence. I think I could be happy, even, provided we could remain together." Naomi's heart grew sad at those words, and, when she re- lated her interview with Mrs. Armstrong and its results, the tears filled Mrs. Hammet's eyes at the prospect of a separa- tion so soon, and it was some moments before she could control her emotion so as to give her daughter a further ac- count of her morning's work. She had called at an embroidery store, which they had often patronized, where worsted goods were sold, and en- gaged to knit some shawls for the proprietor, at a fair price. Mrs. Hammet excelled in fancy work of that description, and had knitted for various fairs and for benevolent pur- poses, simply for the pleasure of employment. Now there was a necessity, she could still exert a talent that had called forth so much admiration from the summer friends who had taken their flight at the first storm of adversity. Thus, the mother and daughter had each called upon the undeveloped resources that had lain hidden in the deeper recesses of their nature, and nobly and promptly had those resources responded to the demand. An hour later found them in the plain, unobtrusive dwell- ing of Isaac Nathans, and they looked around their humble, but comfortably furnished, chamber with a feeling of rest to which they had long been strangers. That day, and for several days after, they were conscious of a serene atmos- phere within their souls, that yielded a rich'reward for all their self-denial.  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7355-00000043"/> 82        INTO THE LIGHT. CHAPTER   XIJn. Oh, fear not in a world like this, And thou shalt know ere long, - Know how sublime a thing it is To suffer and be strong. "ONGFELLOW. "Voyager o'er life's troubled sea, To thine own self be true; And wheresoe'er thy lot may be, Paddle thine own canoe." THE following week, Naomi entered upon her new duties. Her first impression of the school-room appropriated for the children, and where she would doubtless spend many hours, was rather a pleasant one. It was light and airy, containing a bay-window, surrounded by cushioned seats covered with blue and white chintz, from which could be seen a large gar- den, that looked almost summer-like, in consequence of the evergreen hedge which-enclosed it, and the fancifully trimmed spruce-trees that were grouped just opposite; while beyond, across the square, could'be seen the great thoroughfare of Broadway, teeming with restless life and busy traffic, yet enough removed from the din of travel to bring the blended noises to the ear in a soothing monotone that was not un- pleasant, and made one feel that the great elements of toil revolving in human hearts were constantly finding expression in safe and healthful action. A round table, covered with a blue and white cloth, to match the seats in the bay-window, stood in the centre of the room, on which lay maps and school-books.. A bright coal fire burned in the grate. Three maple-wood desks were placed against the wall near- est the fire. A writing-book lay open upon one; the cover of another was thrown back, revealing by unmistakable signs that it belonged to a boy. A half dozen books had   INTO THE LIGHT.          83 been tumbled in, beside a pair of skates, a mass of twine, and a peg-top. On the third desk stood a tall, slender glass, containing one tea-rose and a few green leaves. This cer- tainly belonged, Naomi -thought, to the brown-eyed, loving little Gazelle, who stood near the table, gazing at her young instructress with evident delight and admiration. Gabrielle and Otis were sitting in the bay-window, comparing notes in regard to the new teacher. "I say, Gabe, isn't she jolly?" "Hush, Otis, she will hear you! You must not use that word," whispered Gabrielle, who, being two years older, affected to teach her brother. 6' Well, then, what shall a fellow say? Isn't she hand- some? But I am not sure that I shall like her. Miss Las- celles let us do just as we pleased; she won't, I think. But I tell you, sis, what I should, like to have,-that great shining braid at the back of her head to make a tail for my rocking-horse. Cracky! wouldn't Mazeppa look stylish?" "You must not use such words, I tell you. I will not lis-' ten to you," said Gabrielle, with a suppressed titter. ' If you do, I will tell Miss Vincent." "The deuce you will! I should like to see you try it!" "There, now, I've- said so, and I will!" and his sister at- tempted to rise and go to the table where Naomi sat, in- specting and arranging the books; but she found herself pinioned, held down by the sturdy little fellow's arms, who, in a half-frolicsome, half-angry mood, whispered in her ear, - "Oh, the dickens! won't you catch it if you do!" Gabrielle looked up in comic despair, and found the calm eye of Naomi observing this little by-play. "Children," she said presently, " you will each take your seat at your desk, and write about fifteen minutes." The twins obeyed promptly; but Otis commenced turning out his books with some noise, piling them up in a confused heap outside his desk, while he appeared to be searching for something. Naomi understood somewhat of the spirit of  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7355-00000044"/> 84        INTO THE LIGHT. misrule which had entered the boy, who had evidently re- solved to try hlow far her forbearance would extend on this his first clay of tuition. "Well, Otis, what is it?" she inquired. His movements were arrested by her quiet tone of au- thority. "I1 am looking for my pen," he replied. "Look where you usually keep it." The boy opened, rather reluctantly, a little side drawer, containing several pens, took one out, and placed it in his writing-book; and then putting his arm around the small tower of books he had raised in front of him, he was about to sweep them all back again; but a side glance at his teacher warned him that it would not answer, and he placed them in neatly side by side. It was some time, however, before he commenced writing; the quarter of an hour had expired, and the wilful boy had written only half a line of his copy; recess was announced. He hastily put down his pen, and was half-way-across the room, when Naomi told him to go back to his seat. "Your writing must be attended to, Otis, and you cannot go out this morning until you have finished the page." "' But Miss Lascelles never kept me in at recess, and I don't wish to write any more," he sturdily remonstrated. "You have to obey me, now, Otis, -and I shall not allow you to leave the room until you have finished your task," said Naomi, as she called the little girls to another part of the room, and told them that, as they could not go out in the garden on account of the rain, she would tell them a Swedish story. "Oh, that will be nice! better than reading a book," cried Gazelle. "Tell us about the reindeer, and the snow, and the great snow-shoes they wear." Otis had been standing in no very pleasant mood at his desk, looking out of the window at the drifting clouds and   INTO THE LIGHT.         85 the pouring rain, and debating in his mind whether he had better do as he was bidden, or not. As he heard these words, his face brightened, his ill-humor vanished, and, with boyish frankness, he exclaimed, - "I should like to hear about Sweden and Lapland, Miss Vincent, --the place where they make the snow; can I not?" '"I would like to have you, Otis, very much, but your task must be finished, not only to-day, but every day before you earn your recreation. I shall never exact anything but what is reasonable and proper, and then I shall always expect to be obeyed. I think you would rather be a little gentleman, than a disobedient, unruly boy. You will take your seat now, and commence writing at once." The boy hesitated one moment, and then yielded to her firm but thoroughly kind command, and set himself reso- lutely to the accomplishment of his task, casting a longing glance every now and then towards the corner where sat his teacher with the twins, who were listening with pleased and' eager attention. She told them of some of the distant peasant homes of Sweden, whch stand in the edge of the fir forests, that are covered with snow; of the large, open fireplaces, where great logs of wood so blazed and sparkled, that some- times in the winter evenings no candles were needed; of the warm woollen garments, that were all of home pro- duction; of the busy hum of the spinning-wheels, that are found in almost every Swedish and Norwegian house- hold; of the out-door sports of the children; of the indus- try of the young girls, who spin and weave each day as nany hours as are in this land devoted to the piano, many having no other music, - only the heart melody of a con- tented, frugal life is often woven into the fabric which comes from the loom. Then she told them about another period of the year, the summer time, when there is no night there, but a soft, pleasant, dreamy light, like that of the early morn- 8  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7355-00000045"/> 86        INTO THE LIGRHT. ing in oar own land, invests this strange, distant region in the north with a wonderful, almost mystical, charm. Gazelle drew a long sigh, and said, as she finished,- "I've got back, Miss Itammet." "tIn what way, my dear?"                  "Oh, it seemed," said the imaginative child, " as if I had  been away off there, among the little girls; that I could see : their nice hoods, trimmed with fur, the pretty reindeer, and  the warm, red woollen dresses that you told us about."    : "I used to pity those people in Norway and Sweden," in-  - terrupted Gabrielle; " and, somehow, it seemed to me as if there were no little girls there, it was so cold; but it is really quite a pleasant lplace, after all." "Will you tell us a story every day, Miss Hammet?" in- quired Otis, who had finished his writing, and felt that he might become one of the little group. "Sometimes, - when it storms, and you cannot exercise. It is now time to go back again to your lessons." The prompt and willing obedience they all displayed as they took their seats, proved that Naomi's influence was already beginning to be felt and acknowledged; and she thought, if she could succeed in winning their affections, that she might train their young minds rightly, and, with this hope and aim, her daily tasks would become comparatively light. As dayv succeeded day, Naomi found a sweet engross- ment in the engaging ways and ready sympathy of Gazelle, who was keenly sensitive to praise or censure, and' tried most earnestly to please her gentle teacher (whom'she had loved at once with childish devotion), who constantly endeavored to overcome her extreme love of approbation, and morbid consciousness of personal defects. Aside from the lameness which so mortified her, Gazelle was far more lovely than Gabrielle. Smaller in stature, with greater delicacy of feeling and temperament, she seemed ayear  or two younger than her more robust sister. Both possessed   INTO TIME LIGHT.         or fair complexions, with luxuriant auburn hair, that fell in nat- ural curls over their shoulders. Thus far they were similar; but in other respects there was a marked difference. Ga- zelle's large, brown eyes had been remarkably beautiful from her earliest babyhood, and lighted up her expressive feat- ures, which were faultless in their harmony, at the slightest emotion. Gabrielle's eyes were light and small, and her hair had a more golden hue; but she never thought about being a beauty. She knew that Gazelle was sometimes called so, but herself never; and, rejoicing in perfect health, with all the innocent abandonment of childhood, she wondered why her sister cared who liked or disliked her. Otis Armstrong, the indulged darling of the family, con- tinued to bring occasionally into the school-room a disturb- ing element, that annoyed Naomi, and diverted his sisters' attention from their books; at other times he was docile and studious. One morning Naomi had been trying to teach him a simple lesson in mensuration, when, out of all patience, be- cause he could not understand at once, he threw down his book, and declared " that he would not have a girl to teach him; that he could have done it well enough if he had had Frank Hersey's teacher; that it was not his fault at all." His face crimsoned as he noticed Naomi's surprised, pained expression, and the wondering gaze of his sisters, who had been studying for some time in silence. Gabrielle laughed, and said something about 1' young America," which vexed Otis still more, and he went on to say, " that it was high time that he went to a school where there were boys like himself; that he did not wish to be tied to an apron-string. Bob Mixer said he was, and so did all the boys." !"Otis," said Naomi, in the same mild but firm tone that she would have used had she not listened to this passionate outhreak, 1' whatever you may do in the future, recollect that now you have a lesson which must be learned, and I expect that you will do your best, for your mother's sake as well as your teacher's,- will you not?" And she looked at him  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7355-00000046"/> 88        INTO THE LIGHT. with one of those winning smiles, to which even the wilful but affectionate boy was not insensible, for he stooped and picked up his book, saying, as he did so,- "Miss Hammet, please tell me once more, and I will do better." Naomi tried again to adapt it to his comprehension, and finally succeeded, and the boy's good-nature returned; but the incident depressed and somewhat discouraged her, as he had more than once before caused much perplexity by his waywardness. She felt that he was right in wishing to go to a school among boys of his own age, and also knew that there were times when he would not yield to her influence as quickly as he had then. He had been indulged when younger, and but little inconvenience had resulted from it; but at that time he had just reached the " transition period," when a boy has a very high estimate of his own powers; thinks he knows more than his elders, and is impatient of instruction and restraint. By and by there will come a time when he will look back upon those phases of his boyhood with wonder and amazement. Naomi had one of those plastic and beautiful natures that *would bend and accommodate itself to what is inevitable. But yet, with this happy facility of adaptation, there would come moments when a bitter sense of her lonely position made her almost weary of life; and these words of vain longing and regret came to her mind with peculiar force, "O world I so few the years we live I Would that the life which thou dost give Were life indeed I " At other times she would rise above the pressure of untoward circumstances, and flit away into her own ideal land, that land of dreams where she alone reigned supreme. No men- tal companionship could she find in the superficial mind of Mrs. Armstrong, who sometimes experienced a sort of envy while in her presence, as she noticed that even the careless   INTO THE LIGHT.         89 sentences of the young Jewess had a polish and originality that unconsciously asserted her superiority to those around her, and she experienced a kind of gritm satisfaction that so much beauty and talent was, in a degree, within her power. The only recreation that Naomi enjoyed was when she could leave her young charge and spend an afternoon with her mother. What glad moments were those when they met! How intensely enjoyed! With all the freedom of sisters they received and communicated each other's experi- ences. It was very hard for Mrs. Hammet to apply herself to any continuous employment, and therefore she craved the encouragement and strength of her daughter's more active and vigorous organization, looking forward to her weekly visits as the only sunny spots in her lonely pathway. Dr. Heber came as often as he could to see her, sometimes bringing a bouquet from his wife, some fine fruit from his greenhouse, or an interesting book, - often one that would cause her to ponder deeply upon spiritual truths, and ask if' these things were so. The good physician knew just what reading would aid a soul yearning, although unconsciously, after the inner light, which comes from the Sun of righteous- ness, and bringeth peace and joy to every sorrow-stricken, burdened heart.  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7355-00000047"/> 90         INTO THE LIGHT. CHAPTER XIV. "My joys like summer birds may fly, My hopes like summer blooms depart; But there's one flower that cannot die,- Thy holy memory in my heart. No dews that flower's cup may fill, No sunlight to its leaves be given; But it will live and flourish still, As deathless as a thing of heaven. My soul greets thine, unasked, unsought, - Hast thou for me one gentle thought?  IT had been a changeful morning of clouds and alternate sunshine, until finally, by noon, the clouds obtained the mastery, closed over the occasional sunbreaks, and settled down into heavy, grav masses, that threatened   a storm. Naomi had been having an hour or two of pleasant converse with her mother, and was hastening  homeward, warned by the darkening  sky, when the rain began to fall in heavy drops. She threw   a handkerchief over her bonnet, and passed rapidly up Broadway. But the clouds that had been gathering and witholding their forces all day, soon began to pour forth their garnered resources in good earnest, compel- ling  unwary pedestrians to look about  for a temporary shelter. Naomi paused beneath a friendly awning, and the next moment was startled to find an umbrella extended over her head, and the oily, repulsive tones of Joseph Fleming met her ear. "  I cannot express my delight at meeting you, my dear cousin," he exclaimed. "Repeatedly have I   been disap- pointed in my efforts to obtain the least clue to your resi- dence. Why have you done thus?   Why have you absented yourself. from your kindred, - from one, at least, who would lay down his life in your service; whose hopes, thoughts, and   INTO THE LIGHT.         91 wishes are, and have been all centred in the one purpose of contributing to your happiness?" "If that is true, Mr. Fleming, you can most essentially increase my happiness' by avoiding all reference to the past, fraught with so many unpleasant recollections, and by treat- ing me in the future, whenever and wherever we meet, as an entire stranger." "Never!" he exclaimed, passionately, while his swarthy complexion grew still darker under conflicting emotions. "I will never relinquish the hope of gaining the prize I have so long coveted. It will be impossible for you, slight girl as you are, to attempt to cope with a resolved, persistent nature like my own." A shudder ran through Naomi's frame, as she beheld the fierce, vindictive expression of his countenance, and ob- served that he had placed himself directly in her way, so that she could not pass. But what was her relief and joy, as she looked in all directions to find some avenue of escape from her disagreeaable companion, to see approaching the' well-known figure of Dr. Heber. He was recognized at the same moment by the keen eye of the Jew, who drew the umbrella somewhat down, in order to escape his notice. Naomi suddenly cried, "Doctor, were you looking for me?" The voice arrested his steps, and, as his eye fell upon Fleming and Naomi, he comprehended the whole at a glance. Noticing her disturbed expression, he said, - "I will escort you home, AMiss Hammet. You are now under my protection." Fleming bowed; and, with a sarcastic smile, remarked, - "I am happy to leave you in such good company, cousin Naomi. A physician is a privileged knight-errant to rescue forlorn damsels from imaginary dangers, even although a fair wife awaits him at home." And with that last venomous thrust lie turned and left them. Naomi, by an effort, suppressed her feelings, but the reac-  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7355-00000048"/> 92        INTO THE LIGHT. tion was so great that she felt tempted to laugh and cry in a breath, so overjoyed was she at her opportune release. The doctor saw her. emotion, and led her to talk of her daily duties at Mrs. Armstrong's; and by his kind, sympa- thetic counsel, soon diverted her mind, and gave her time to rally her mental powers before entering the house. They parted at the door, and she was met immediately in the hall by Mrs. Armstrong, who was evidently not in a genial humor,                   f "I wanted you very much, Miss Hammet, this afternoon, as I had some friends call, who were anxious to hear one of Beethoven's sonatas played, and Gabrielle was unwilling to play anytling unless you were present." ("I am very sorry to have disappointed you," said Naomi, "but I depend greatly upon visiting my mother at least once a week; indeed, I should not feel willing to remain any- where without that privilege." Mrs. Armstrong took the alarm at that remark, for she was very proud of the eclat of having so distinguished a looking person for her daughter's governess, and took every opportunity of displaying such an elegant appendage to her establishment. It had vexed her to think that the Mans- fields had called, and she had lost the opportunity to act the, lady patroness, especially as they moved in a circle a little higher than her own, and she'had hoped to excite their ad- miration and envy. Little Gazelle, as if to palliate her mother's irritable de- meanor towards her teacher, stole up behind her and gently clasped her hand, at the same time looking up in her face with so much sympathy and affection that Naomi stooped and kissed her fair forehead, and murmured, "' Darling Zella, Heaven grant that life's reverses and trials may never be your portion!" and passed quickly out of the room. "Pray what did Miss Hammet say to you just now, Ga- zelle?" inquired Mrs. Armstrong, sharply. But the next moment her attention was attracted towards   INTO THE LIGHT.         93 Ot is, who was tossing a large rubber ball fearfully near a fa- vorite Parian marble vase, and Gazelle was not obliged to answer her mother's question, to her great relief; for she had early learned that there were some natures which could not comprehend the depth of even her childish emotions, and she intuitively shrunk from repeating those words of deep feeling, which had sunk into her young heart and left an in- delible impression there. Amid moments of shadow and gloom, there came, at times, to the lonely orphan girl, like a ray of sunshine, a thought of the gentlemanly stranger who had made so pleas- ing an impression upon her heart; who, indeed, realized her ideal of true manliness. And as she wondered if it would ever be her happy lot to meet him again, she could not help having a vague hope that he might some day find his way to her present home; although, in secluding herself from the evil designs of Joseph Fleming, she had most effectually shut out the few friends that remained in their hour of sorrow. She knew not how many fruitless attempts had, been made by the Rev. Horace Vincent to obtain the least clue to her residence, and that at each disappointment he would vainly resolve that he would think of her no more. One morning, about a week later, the servant knocked at the school-room door, and told Naomi that Mrs. Armstrong wished her to come down into the parlor a few minutes, - that some one wished to see her, - and bring her last music- book. With a quickened pulse and glowing cheek she obeyed the summons, for a hope that she would not confess to her- self brightened her eye and gave lightness and elasticity to her step. But, alas! on entering the parlor, she found two fashionably dressed ladies, sitting with expectant faces, evi- dently having just made her the subject of conversation. Mrs. Armstrong was seated upon a lounge, in a half-reclin- ing position, and as she came near she said, in languid tones, -  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7355-00000049"/> "        INTO THE LIGHT. "Miss Ilammet, I wish you would oblige me by play- ing the last piece of music which you have been teaching Gazelle." Suddenly the younger of the two ladies exclaimed, - "Why, Naomi Htam met! what an age it has been since we last met! Who would have thought of you as the gov- erness of whom Mrs. Armstrong spoke? Do you remember that evening at Colburn's, when you and Victoria Mixer were the belles of the party? Vic," she continued, '" don't you know M iss Hammct?3" The young lady addressed looked at her haughtily, and then said '" she believed they had met before." Truly, they had met many times before, and once she had been a guest at an elegant entertainment given at Mr. Ham- met's own house; while Victoria well remembered her envy and admiration of the tasteful elegance of Naomi's maroon- colored velvet dress, and the exquisite beauty and richness of the pearl ornaments which shone in her dark hair, and decked her fair neck and arms. What a contrast was pre- sented in the quiet figure of the governess as she then be- held her, clad in a simple black thibet, with plain white col- lar and cuffs! Yet there was a matchless dignity in the slight inclination of the finely formed head, crowned with its wealth of shining hair, as she returned Victoria's super- cilious greeting, that seemed to remove the vain, frivolous girl far below the despised teacher, who was so nobly assert- ing her independence by the equal right of labor. Before Naomi could comply with Mrs. Armstrong's re- quest, a gentleman, who had been standing at the lower end of the apartment, looking over some engravings, but who had evidently come in company with the ladies, advanced, and said, - "Did not I hear you talking of music, Mrs. Armstrong, my passion and delight! A song! my kingdom for a song!" There was no mistaking the insinuating tones of that voice, and Naomi knew, even before she turned, that her   INTO THE LIGHT.          95 cousin had been successful in obtaining an entrance to her present home. He appeared, however, to others as an en- tire stranger; not by word or look did he seem to recognize ler, and in an easy, indifferent manner, commenced urging Victoria to sing and play only one song. That young lady had not forgotten Miss Hammet's su- perior playing, and replied, laughingly, that, like all great artists, she could never do anything well unless in the mood, and just at that time she was very far from being inspired by the spirit of song. That remark reminded Mrs. Armstrong of her former re- quest, and she sharply repeated it. "Miss Hammet, we are all expectation; will you sing?" Naomi advanced towards the instrument with perfect self- possession, and seated herself. "I must decline singing, madam," she said, quietly, " as I, too, am not in the mood," and commenced playing a bril- liant and difficult piece which happened to be open before her. Mrs. Armstrong opened her bold, black eyes in astonish- ment at her unusual assurance, but said nothing. Both la- dies, ignoring her presence, commenced talking with great volubility upon indifferent subjects; and before she had ceased, Victoria gathered up her furs, which Joseph Flem- ing adjusted with devoted attention, and the trio took their leave, without bestowing any further attention upon the gov- erness. Naomi, who understood perfectly the desire for display which actuated Mrs. Armstrong, knew that she was not wanted longer, and, at the same time, retreated to the quiet of the. little school-room, where her only solace had been the devoted attachment of Gazelle, who had well repaid the teachings of her young instructress, having made remark- able progress in those branches wlich had heretofore been neglected in consequence of her delicate health. By a strong effort of the will, she put aside all thought of the mor- tification of the morning; all uneasiness respecting the too  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7355-00000050"/> 96(       INTO THE LIGHT. evident intentions of Joseph Fleming to continue to per- secute her with his attentions; and, commending herself to the God of Jacob, she applied herself to the duties before her with a feeling of wonder at the calmness which pervaded her whole being. Scarcely conscious of her superiority to those with whom she had been brought in contact, she felt lifted into another sphere, a more serene atmosphere, than she had known for a long period. Gabrielle seemed to apply herself better than usual, and Otis came in, with his face glowing with delight, to announce that his father had consented that he should go to the same school with Frank Hersey; that he was now going out skating, without lhaving any more home lessons. "So good- by to your smart scholar," he exclaimed, " for I shall get a medal, you may depend;" and, putting up his rosy cheek to be kissed, he bounded out of the room, feeling a new sense of responsibility and manliness come upon him, in view of his promotion, as he termed it, to his right place among boys. Thus one trial was suddenly taken away, and Naomi sat musing for some time after he had left the room upon the way through which she had been led. Like an Israelite of old, she had been safely guided along the desert of her daily experience, but as yet with no promised land in view; for no pleasant anticipations of future comfort or ease dawned upon her mental horizon. Almost unconsciously she murmured to herself, - "Nearer, my God, to thee; E'en though it be a cross which raiseth me." She started as the last words fell from her lips. The cross! Was that symbol of Christianity, the hope of be- lievers in him who is called the divine Redeemer, becoming incorporated in her nature? Was the unwonted sense of peace, that she had that morning experienced, the result of faith in him who walked the Sea of Galilee, and who spake   INTO THE LIGHT.          97 to the stormy elements words of power, and there was a great calm? She knew not. Still, as through a glass dimly, she gazed, hoping for a full revelation of those divine truths that were even now- although she knew it not --beginning to lead her into the green pastures and beside the still waters that flow through the promised land. CHAPTER XV. A shock of laughter made them friends at once, And laughter floated through their after talk, As darts a bright bird in and out the leaves. ALEXANDER SMTf. Tell me, and tell me truly, Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman? SHAKESPEARE. As the weeks passed on, and the school term drew near to a close, the friendship between Laura Vincent and Julia Car- rington led to many kind offices on both sides. Laura as- sisted Julia in her studies, and she gave Laura free access to their well-stored library. One day Laura had returned Longfellow's works, and-had selected Tennyson's princess to read to her sister for the first time, with some such feeling as one would experience who had just obtained possession of a valuable mine, whose hid- den riches were about to be revealed, while the glow of glad anticipation at her heart gave such a brightness to her young face, that Julia exclaimed, impulsively,- "Laura Vincent, how I wish I loved reading and books as' well as you do! Nothing in the world seems to delight you so much. I never had any one to read to me when I was a 9  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7355-00000051"/> 98        INTO THE LIGHT. child; my mother was always too sick, and I naturally dis- liked study, I think. Sometimes I feel that I am of no real use in the world, any way." And she gafve a slight, discon- tented shrug of the shoulders as she thoughts with envy; of- her own plain features in'contrast with the sparkling vivacity of her companion. "I am too homely for anything,' she continued, with a frank smile of returning good-humor. "You are not so," replied Laura, earnestly; " at least, not to me. Only think how much your friendship has been to me, and how much pleasure you have already given me. I am sure, I never thought whether you were plain or not. I think those we love always look pleasing to us." "It was just that which gave you such an influence over me, you little witch!" replied Julia, with a touch of tender feeling in her tone. "I thought you really cared for me, and I grew to love you in return, and tried to imitate a little your gentleness and self-denial." "I am not so unselfish as you suppose, Julia," said Laura, soberly, as there flashed across her memory a bright winter morning, a few weeks since, when revengeful feelings made her so thoroughly unhappy that she would fain have put aside her studies altogether to gratify them; yet she knew that a battle had been fought, and the victory was hers. The two girls walked down the avenue together arm- in-arm a few moments without speaking, each taking a hasty retrospect of the past; and then, with the versatility of youth, they commenced an animated discussion of school compositions, until they reached the gate of entrance. As they lingered a moment for a few parting words, there emerged from the thick shrubbery in the neighborhood of the hall the slight but athletic figure of a young man about nineteen years of age. He carried in his hand a short switch, with which he seemed to be carelessly knocking the icicles that hung like pendant jewels upon the evergreens that surrounded the park. There was a certain easy grace in every motion, and a well-bred air, as he sauntered to-   INTO THE LIGHT.         99 wards them, that indicated a familiar acquaintance with fashionable society. "Why, cousin Julia," he cried, lifting his hat as she drew near,!"I scarcely recognized you, so much have you changed; so tall have you grown since our last college term, that I did not know whether I might presume to address you with the freedom of old times." "I can return the compliment, Harry Winthrop," said Julia, laughing; " for that elegant mustache of yours is so far superior to any yet seen in our humble village, that I know not if I may dare call you Harry. Air. Winthrop, my friend, Laura Vincent." The grimace with which Harry Winthrop received the compliment, and the condescending bow he bestowed upon the petite, child-like figure before him, were so irresistibly comical, that Laura burst into a merry, girlish laugh, that caused him to observe more closely his eousin's companion; and his patronizing expression changed somewhat as her mirthful eyes were raised a moment to return his salutation, and he thought he had never beheld eyes of such softness, depth, and lustre. II That is the loveliest little fairy I ever saw, cousin Julia!" he exclaimed, as she turned away after bidding them farewell. "Childhood and womanhood combined! Why, at first I thought she was a mere child; but she returned my bow with so much mock dignity, that I felt that it was a young lady whem I addressed, and raised my hat as I would to a princess. Who is she? Does she belong here?" "Oh, yes," replied Julia; "she, with her sister Grace, live in this place with their grandparents; they are orphans, and have one brother preparing for the ministry. We have," she continued, a little piqued at what she thought the rather extravagant praises of her favorite cousin, " only. just dis- covered that her acquaintance is worth having." "Well, I am very sure that my heart was in my posses- sion this morning," he rejoined; " but whether yonder little  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7355-00000052"/> 100        INTO THE LIGHT. gipsy has stolen it, remains to be proved;" and he sprang up the steps of his uncle's stately mansion with all the hearty joyousness of boyhood, just in time to meet him at the door, with a face beaming with the 'cordial welcome he knew so well how to bestow. "' Harry Winthrop, what a pleasant surprise! You have come just in time to help the girls'arrange the Christmas-tree. Belle Bradford is here. You remember her, do you not?" "Oh, yes, I saw her at Newport last summer." "' Well, they have had more than one merry time in antici- pation. We are to have a dance, I believe, after the distri- bution of gifts, and they insist that I shall lead off the first cotillon," said the 'squire, laughing; l" when I have not danced for five years." "' That is right, uncle," said Harry; " you will never grow old while you have that genial, contagious laugh, that stirs one's blood, and gives the impression that a sunbeam has suddenly burst in and lighted up the room. My father enjoys a joke, but he never laughs aloud." "Oh, Winthrop is a perfect gentleman in his way," said Mr. Carrington, " and dignity becomes his stately figure much more than it would a rotund personage like myself. Now, I suppose he would not be guilty of playing blind- man's-buff, or any game of romps, while I have fully enlisted, and have taken the oath of allegiance to fun and frolic. Belle will tell you that there are times when I am indeed a boy again." The young lady whom he addressed looked up with a bright smile, and rising, instantly extended her hand to acknowledge her former acquaintance. '"Belle, I see that you know my nephew," said Mr. Car- rington, " and I trust that he will supply just what was wanted to make our Christmas fete a grand success." Belle called Harry's attention to a winter scene she was copying, and the two were soon in easy conversation. Julia, having thrown aside her school cloak and bonnet,   INTO THE LIGHT.         101 entered the room with an evergreen wreath upon her head, studded with scarlet berries, and her arms full of -vines, that were to be arranged in some picturesque form about the drawing-rooms. Although possessing no claim to beauty, there were times when the 'squire's daughter could be called attractive. Her dark etyes seemed to have a new lustre, and her expression was mild and happy. "Come, Belle and Harry," she cried, "' Saint Nic. has ordered these evergreens to be tied together until they are full enough to festoon prettily. Have you a mind to prepare for his coming?" '"Yes, indeed," replied Belle, pleasantly, as she seated herself on a low hassock, and engaged in her rural occupas tion with all the eagerness of a child; while Julia entertained her handsome cousin with many a school anecdote that elicited his hearty laughter. Whom do you expect on Christmas evening?" asked Winthrop, hoping to hear again the name of the sweet flower he had seen by the wayside. ( All the elite of the village of L--, of course," replied Julia; "Dr. Greenwood and his two daughters, Lawyer Hobbs and his bouquet of beauties, the Armstrongs from New York, and many a lad and lassie to I trip the light fan- tastic toe.' The great spruce-tree which you see yonder, elevated upon that green mound at the end of the drawing- room, will contain a present for each one; as we have a select company, we can do this to their satisfaction." W"What sort of a gift have you for the little fairy I met this morning?" inquired Harry, with ill-concealed interest. "Oh, she has not been invited," replied Julia; "L although I should like to have her come very much, but thought it of no use to ask her, as the Vincents never attend parties if invited, and we have not known each other long." "Invite the two sisters and their brother, by all means," said her father, who had for some time been an attentive 9*  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7355-00000053"/> 102       INTO THE LIGHT. listener. "I remember when old Mr. Vincent was one of the first men of our village." "But, father, what have we for gifts? May I give Laura what I please?" "Certainly, my daughter, provided it be within reason." Julia's countenance lighted up with a new idea, and she approached her father, saying, ingenuously,- I wish to repair a wrong done. I have broken Laura Vincent's inkstand, and I would like to get her another, -- a bronze stand for ink and pens; and I can present it to her from the tree as a Christmas token." The father, unaccustomed to deny his daughter anything, took out his well-filled pocket-book and handed her a roll of bills. She called to Harry to come with her and assist in making the purchase. The invitation notes were despatched, and the two cousins took their way down the broad street to the principal storoe, where they found a handsome and convenient inkstand, far superior to the one given by Horace to his sister. On their return they were met by a gentleman who bowed and smiled, but was not recognized at first by Julia. -"I do believe that is Mr. Vincent, Laura's brother," sud- denly cried Julia. "I saw him once at a school etaim- ination and Mr. Harper introduced me to him, because I was the only scholar who recited alone. I remember that I made a great blunder in that lesson, but no notice was taken of it. Mr. Harper intends that I shall not appear to be the dunce I am. I wish," she continued, " that JI had half the application of that little sister of his. She is one of the best students we have in school; her sister Grace teaches her, I believe, while I have had no such advantages." 1"Never mind, Julia," said Harry, " we will teach them that our'taste for getting up a Christmas party is unsurpassed. Come in and we will arrange the gifts." Harry took out a pencil and writing, in a plain, bold hanld, Laura's name upon   INTO THE LIGHT.          10,3 the package, he suspended it among many others of tinsel and gold, that decorated the immense Christmas-tree. 'Squire Carrington had in early life been a poor boy, but by a series of successful speculations he had amassed a handsome property, and in purchasing Briarwood Hall, with    a all its refined decorations, he only exercised the native taste which he inherited from his mother, who was an artist's daughter, and who bequeathed him a taste for flowers and luxury as his only inheritance. Fortune, however, favored him, and he now possessed ample means to gratify his boy- hood's wildest aspirations. His wife had been a delicate flower that bloomed prema- turely, and then sunk into listlessness and inactivity. For   , many years- she had not taken the charge of her household, through failing health, and at last when she did pass away, she was not so deeply lamented or missed as would have been a more active temperament. This was why Julia's home education had been so much neglected, and now the 'squire had yielded up his authority, in a great measure, to  his widowed sister, Mrs. Goodrich, who sometimes found it difficult to control and guide her wayward neice. She had found a pleasant home in her brother's house for several  years. After a series of disappointments attending her married life, finally laying away in the tomb one who' was her joy, and also her grief, she lhad come at last to consider a quiet nook more desirable than all the pleasures and follies of the fashionable world. As she paced up and down the elegant parlors, stopping occasionally to direct the workmen who were arranging in graceful devices the evergreen vines, it was quite easy to see that she was one whose slightest wish or command would be heeded more from the affection which she always called forth from her inferiors, than from any servile fear. Meanwhile great preparations for the fAte were going on in the culinary department, all of which needed a guiding hand. Aunt Goodrich was one of those useful women who  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7355-00000054"/> 104       INTO THE LIGHT. quietly and unobtrusively accomplish more in one day than some busy, bustling, pretentious characters would in a week. "She looked well to the ways of her household," and'Squire Carrington finding all things about him working smoothly and harmoniously, thought not of taking unto himself a wife, although the old ladies of L-- had selected more than one who would be just the right person needed. Thus Julia bid fair to become the heiress of Briarwood Hall and all its broad lands. "Grace, my sister, see what has been left at the door by a servant," said Laura Vincent, holding up two envelopes tied with white ribbon. "I should think it was an invitation to a wedding some- where," said Grace; " untie them Laura, and learn who is to be made happy, or miserable," she would have added, but. her watchful care over the heart and mind of her sister, led ' her to guard well even her trifling words. "You have guessed wrongly," replied Laura; " it is an invitation to a festive gathering at Briarwood Hall, and here is one for Horace; so we   can all go,--can we not?"  "I do not know that it would be best, my dear," said Grace, thoughtfully; " we are so little acquainted, that I doubt whether Horace can be persuaded; still, I am desirous that you shall have all the amusement that is proper for your age; and then, again, I wish to show that your offer of friendship was a generous one." Just then Horace returned, and the brother and sisters, after some hesitation, concluded to go to the party, and Laura, all animation and delight, began to wonder who -would be there; if there would be any visitors from New York, for Julia had told her that some of her city friends dressed with all the style of belles. "It is of trifling importance how we dress," said Grace, "if it be only with simple neatness and good taste; ex- travagance in outward adornment is one of the weaknesses   INTO THE LIGHT.         105 of our sex; but as woman rises into her true position in the scale of civilization, she will learn to place a proper estimate upon mere externals." "All that may be true," said Laura; "but I cannot help wishing sometimes that I had dresses as costly as Julia's, or 8 even Mary Mason's. I like to look- upon a beautiful fabric almost as well as I do to see the many-colored flowers that adorn our garden. Some time I intend to be an authoress, Grace, and when I have become famous, my sister shall be clad in the costhest furs, and the richest velvets; jewels rare shall sparkle in her auburn hair -" "That will do, Laura," said her sister, smiling. "I ear- nestly hope that time may be far distant, for I am well content in my present sphere, and at times unspeakably happy, when one, who is my hope and my joy, overcomes tempta- tion." This allusion to her past struggle in the right way, so- bered the laughing girl for a moment, and she seemed to apprehend, in a degree, the constant love and watchfill care of her beloved sister. "A truce to all such wishes," she exclaimed. "I do not think wealth essential to one's happiness; still, I feel that I should not object to a portion of the abundance possessed by some, for the reason that I would like it for other purposes besides my own selfish pleasure. Never mind, Grace; I think there is no prospect that my strength of character in that direction will be put to the test." "I think not very soon, my dear, but you will want it in many other ways." Laura commenced humming a tune, in one of her change- fill moods; then seating herself at the piano she played a brilliant passage from Norma. "Come, sister," she cried a moment after, springing from her seat, "1 we have had a little bit of a lecture on dress; let us illustrate by going up stairs and selecting those we are to. wear on Christmas evening."  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7355-00000055"/> 106        INTO THE LIGHT. They were detained a moment by their brother's announce- ment that he was going back to New York that evening, but promised to return in time for the party. "Now remember, Miss Laura," he said, "I take this pains for your ladyship almost exclusively. Grace and I do not care to go." "Perhaps you will meet your fate there, brother Horace," said Laura, archly, " and that will bring its own sweet re- ward." IIow often-the light word spoken in jest becomes fraught with a deeper meaning, when remembered in connection with after events! CHAPTER XVI. "Peace on earth, good will to men," Burst the Christmas anthem then. floating o'er the waves of time, Comes to us that song sublime. HALE. ONE morning Gazelle Armstrong entered the school-room, bearing a note, which she handed to Naomi, saying, - "Mamma   says that Tom may take us in the carriage to Mr. Carrington's, - they are to have a Christmas party, - provided you will consent to go with us, Miss Hammet. Mamma   cannot go, and there will be no one to take us in charge; so please say you will." '"But I cannot, Gazelle, go into any festive scene now; my feelings would ill accord with youthful sports." '"Oh, I am so sorry!" she replied gently, striving to keep back the tears that filled her soft brown eyes. "Papa will not let us go without you, and I want to see cousin, Julia so much.  But perhaps we   can have a Christmas-tree at home."   INTO THE LIGHT.         107 A moment after, Gabrielle came in, all animation, and added her entreaties to those of her sister. Naomi, unwill- ing to deprive them of so much pleasure, at last reluctantly consented, and they ran in high glee to bear the tidings to their mother, who instantly gave orders to have their last new dresses in preparation, and the little girls were all de- lighted expectation, wishing the hours away. "The merriest time of all the year " drew near. The day prized beyond that of all others, by young and old, by rich and poor, bright Christmas day! bringigT  glad tidings from the past of good will to man, and irradiating the present with a chastening, healthful influence, that disposed many a heart, unaccustomed to look beyond its own selfish inter- ests, to remember, at least for that time, the poor and friendless. The morning dawned bright and beautiful. The clear, blue sky, the frosty air, the dazzling sunshine, brought forth the good wishes of the season, with a warmth and earnest- ness that conveyed to the giver and receiver a passing bless- ing.. God smiled upon the earth, and his love filled the hearts of his creatures with peace and joy. Naomi, on that day, felt disposed to cast aside all care and abandon herself to the influence of the hour and the oc- casion. Her composure, however, was somewhat disturbed by the reception of a package containing an elegant book of engravings, which she immediately restored to its envelope, and calling Tom, hastily bade him hail the carrier, if possi- ble, as she wished to speak with him. Ever ready to do her slightest bidding, he sprang down the steps and suc- ceeded in arresting his footsteps just as he was disappearing around the corner. The direction, ;' From one who is and ever will be your devoted admirer," was sufficient, even if the writing did not betray the hand of Joseph Fleming. Naomi handed the package to the boy, and requested him to return it to the one who sent it, saying that Miss Hammet  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7355-00000056"/> 108        INTO THE LIGHT. declined the honor, and by no means to ever again come on a similar errand. As the day drew near its close, with unwilling hands she arrayed herself to accompany her young charge. Very beautiful she looked, even in her black dress, which con- trasted so finely with her clear complexion. Her large, lus- trous eyes, and even, pearly teeth gave so brilliant a char- acter to her face that her mourning garments failed to impart a sombre appearance. The twins came into the drawing-room, dressed in delicate white tulle. Skirt rose above skirt, ending in a ruffle at the waist, each looped up at intervals with roses and trailing white flowers. Gabrielle bounded into her father's arms, re- gardless of the symmetry of her skirts, which Madame Le Ray had taken so much pains to arrange, while Gazelle, whose constant effort was to conceal her lameness, came in more quietly, and softly glided up to her- father's chair, wait- ing for his approval. He looked at them both with fond ad- miration. "Well, my fairies," he said, "I do not know which will bear the palm to-night." "Oh, Zella, papa!" cried Gabrielle; " she always does; she is by far the best dancer." Singular enough, her lameness did not interfere with her grace in dancing, and therefore she delighted in that innocent amusement, and truly healthful exercise, which, in its ' poe- try of motion," seems peculiarly adapted for children, and only becomes harmful when appropriated by adults as a pre- text for late hours and dissipation. Her soft eyes bright- ened, and, with a happy, radiant smile, she courtesied and took one or two dancing steps forward as her mother entered. Gabrielle caught her at the waist, and the twin sisters waltzed a few moments for their parents' amusement. Then Mr. Armstrong escorted Naomi to the carriage, lifted in the twin blossoms, and bowed respectfully as they drove off, while he murmured, "Happy spring-time of youth! how   INTO THE LIGHT.         109 their undisguised delight carries me back to my own youth- ful days, when the anticipation of a party of pleasure was sufficient to make me happy as a bird." The fine mansion of the Carringtons was brilliantly lighted throughout when they arrived, the atmosphere within was summer-like, and they were warmly welcomed by the host who received them on entering. A moment after Julia, dressed in an azure silk dress, with scarlet geranium blos- soms in her hair, came bounding towards them. "Gabrielle and Gazelle Armstrong, I am so glad th see you! How exceedingly lovely you look!" she exclaimed, as their wrappings were taken off. "You have come in time for the plays, and then we are to be admitted to the secrets of the Christmas-tree." "This is my dear governess, Miss Hammet, Mr. Carring- ton," said Gazelle. "With much persuasion we induced her to come with us; but she does not wish to go into the draw- ing-room, but prefers to remain upstairs." Mr. Carrington expressed his pleasure at seeing her with so much heartiness that Naomi felt at ease at once; he then led her to a bookcase in the anteroom, begging her to choose whatever she liked to read, if, indeed, she would not favor them with her company downstairs, and ended by in- troducing Mrs. Goodrich, his sister, to her favorable notice. That lady was attracted at once by the elegant and graceful manners of the stranger, who was introduced as the gov- erness, and paused a moment, involuntarily, to converse with her, but -was soon called away to receive visitors. The sound of glad music and happy childrens' voices fell on her ear. Many were coming in and out, but no familiar face or form met her eye; and, as the hours passed on, a sense of loneliness began to steal over her, when she felt a soft, white arm wind around her neck, and heard Gazelle's loving words murmuring in her ear, - i"Darling teacher, Mr. Carrington says that he will take it as a great favor if you will come downstairs. He is coming 10  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7355-00000057"/> "O        INTO THE LIGHT. to bring you himself. And if you will only play for us just one tune, I will be so glad!" Just at that moment Mr. Carrington entered, accompanied by his daughter. "Miss Hammet, we are come in force to take you," she laughingly said; " will you not oblige us with your com- pany? Pray do!" To decline such earnest solicitation would not have ac- corded with Naomi's idea of courtesy. Assenting pleas- antly, she followed them into the splendid drawing-room, where a merry scene met her eye. The children were engaged in various games, and their elders had laid aside their years and gravity, and were as inuch children as the rest. Mr. Carrington gave Naomi his arm, and they passed up to where Mrs. Goodrich stood, near a grand piano. "This young lady I place under your especial care," he said, addressing his sister, who replied that it was a charge which gave her great pleasure. From the first moment of introduction she had been con- scious of a lively interest in the youthful stranger, and she drew her into conversation, charmed with the ease and nat- uralness of her replies. They had been talking together a short time, when Naomi heard a rich, mellow voice near, that delighted while it surprised her, and she turned hastily to greet Horace Vincent, whose fine features were irradiated with unmistakable joy at so unexpected a meeting. For a moment he bent the full power of a gaze upon her that was devoted and tender in spite of himself; then, retaining his clasp of her hand, he spoke in low, earnest tones, that carried with them the magnetism of true feeling,-- "Could I tell you, Miss Hammet, how I have sought you, how I have almost despaired of ever meeting you again, you would, I know, pardon me that I greeted you with all the joy of an old acquaintance. Sorrow has lain heavily upon you since we last met, and I would have been near to comfort you   INTO THE LIGHT.         t" as a friend, if I might. You have met with sad reverses. Will you tell me where you are to be found, and give me permission to renew our short but pleasant acquaintance?" Naomi's eyes fell before his earnest gaze, and she told him, in a few words, where and what was her present, posi- tion, and that, for reasons she could not name, she had secluded herself from all her friends. More than that she dlid not say; but Vincent took it for granted that he was at liberty to call, receiving no denial, and he became in con- versation brilliant and fascinating to an unusual degree. The young teacher stood almost spellbound, listening to bursts of spontaneous eloquence that stamped her evident admirer as a man of no ordinary genius. Her own intel- lectual capacity seemed for the time very far below his own. Her answers were few and short, and her spirit seemed to rest in a sweet content and trust, such as no other com- panionship had ever afforded. She had come within the sphere of a nature that blended perfectly in unison with her own, and she experienced that " serene and blessed mood" described by Wordsworthl,- "In which the affections gently lead us on; While, with an eye made quiet by the power Of harmony, and the deep power of joy, We see into the life of things." Not long were they permitted the exclusive enjoyment of each other's society; for they were soon surrounded by a cluster of fair girls, led by little Gazelle, who, in the name of them all, begged for a song. Vincent started forward, took his sister Laura, who stood among them, by the hand, and introduced  her, saying, with a smile, that she was the youngest of the family, and, conse- quently, a little spoiled; liked to have her own way. "Which trait, however, is a family failing, remember," interrupted Laura, archly; " but confined almost entirely, I think, to my brother Horace!" and she tossed back her curls  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7355-00000058"/> "2        INTO THE LIGHT. with a free, childish sauciness that amused Naomi, who had a keen sense of humor, and saw at a glahce that Laura was richly endowed by the same nameless grace and charm of expression which so much attracted all who came within the sphere of Horace Vincent's influence.            ! "I am very happy to make your acquaintance, Miss     i. Laura," she said; " but I shall not promise to indulge the family trait of which you speak." "Only this once, Miss Hamlmet," she rejoined. "Gazelle  Armstrong says that in the re-alm of song you reign supreme. : Now, we have come as attendants to bear you to your throne, on yonder music-stool." Naomi looked down into her fair young face, and answered her with a smile, and, without further solicitation, took her seat at the piano. Running her fingers lightly over the keys , for a moment, she seemed to feel a sense of power - of perfect command-over the instrument that reminded her so much  of her own; and then there flowed forth from the keys such i a volinme of melody, - airy, delicate, and exhilarating, that ' all the joy and happiness that was once hers, and to which she had been lonr a stranger, seemed to surge forth through those eloquent sounds and overflow her being. Then she paused, and, like the warble of a bird, sweet and low, commenced to sing.  Soon her magnificent voice gained volume and power, and filled the spacious apartment with transcendent melody. Fitting homage was paid to her talent by the entire cessation of games, and the stillness that per- vaded the apartment. The young girls thanked her, enthusiastically, and Ga- zelle, with eyes suffused with emotion, said, "I always knew my teacher excelled in everything; but I never heard you sing lile that before, Miss Hammet." Horace Vincent, who had never left her side, now gave her his arm, and conducted her to a seat, near which sat his sis- ter Grace, who had, at once, recognized the Jewish maiden, from her brother's animated description of her, and who had , * ,   ISTO THE IIGHT.         "X her misgivings as to the effect her presence would produce      l upon his heart. Unlike Laura, who seemed to love her at once. Grace-- more cautious in her temperament- began, after her intro- duction, a critical survey of her face and manner, and, after a few moments' conversation, a mental analysis of her character. She could not help being struck with the modest dignity which pervaded her deportment, and the rare beauty of hler face and figure, the clear olive of her complexion, the long, dark eyelashes, which shaded eyes that were soft and bril- liant, and, at times, keen and penetrating, and she knew, intuitively, that she had a mind that could fully cope with her own. But that she should win the love of her brother was more than she was willing to believe, more than she was willing to bestow. That brother, - so dear to her heart, so near the perfection of all manliness, - how could she see him give his whole heart to another, when it had been almost ex- clusively her own? But Grace sWas of too noble a nature to let such selfish thoughts influence her long, and, making an effort to recall her usual calm demeanor, she conversed' pleasantly and affably with her brother's new friend, while Horace stood a little removed, watching, however, the im- pression receive(d by both parties; for he felt anxious that they should be pleased with each other. Tlhe soft, blue eyes and fair, blonde complexion of Grace formed a pretty contrast to the dark beauty of Naomi; and, while he gazed, iMrs. Goodrich approached, leaning on the arm of a gentleman of distinguished bearing, and introduced him to Naomi and Grace Vincent as Mr. Bancroft, from Brooklyn,--a former friend of her husband. Percy Bancroft was a lawyer by profession; but, having an ample fortune, he had travelled much, with very little at- tention to his law duties. As an ex-member of Congress, he had free entree into the best society; but intriguing mammas and fascinating daughters had failed to make him renounce his lot of single blessedness.  10*  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7355-00000059"/> "4        INTO THE LIG-IT. Bancroft was an ardent admirer of beauty in woman; but possessing a matured mind, he required something besides mere personal attractions. He could, from   his varied talents, interest almost any one upon whom he bestowed his notice. His clear, gray eyes had, at times, a cold, metallic glitter, and then would soften and beam  with untold tenderness when talking  upon any theme that awakened emotion. His mouth, when in repose, had a cynical expres- sion, and  was his plainest feature; but it was redeemed by the rare beauty of his smile, that seemed to win all hearts. He could, upon occasion, be most eloquent, and he bent him- self, at that time, to the task of entertaining and fascinating, if need be, those two fair girls. His light, easy badinage amused them, at first, and then he began to expatiate, with feeling, upon the moral beauty and benign influence of that Christmas eve, which brought the glad tidings of the advent of the Prince of Peace, when the LI Star in the East" looked down il serene splendor upon the hills and vales of Palestine, while - "  Calm on the listening ear of night, Came heaven's melodious strains; Whlere wild Judea stretches far Her silver-mantled plains. O'er the blue depths of Galilee There comes a holier calm; And Sharon waves, in solemn praise, Her silent groves of palm." Grace thought she had never heard lines quoted with a more harmonious intonation, and her bright blue eyes un- consciously looked their approval when he ceased speaking. Bancroft appreciated the delicate tribute to his versatile powers, and addressed the young lady in consequence more exclusively. "Do you enjoy, Miss Vincent, the happiness of the juve- nile humanity around us?" he inquired, with animation. "See! They are clowning with a  wreath of holly that per-   INTO THE LIGHT.         115 feet fairy-like beauty, who is laughing with such childish abandon." "That is Laura Vincent, your sister, is it not?" said Mrs. Goodrich, appealing to Grace, who replied in the affirmative, while a vivid blush of pleasure deepened the color on her cheek. Praise of her sister found its way to her heart at once, and she felt a grateful interest in one who seemed to admire her heart's darling. "Look! What a lovely circle!" continued Bancroft. "What a beautiful living bouquet those young girls repre- sent I What a graceful, easy carriage; what airy 'lightness of step! They have, indeed, poetry in every motion'!  "They are charming girls. The twins, Gabrielle and Ga- zelle Armstrong, reflect great credit upon their instructress, Miss Hammet," replied Mrs. Goodrich. Percy Bancroft turned towards Naomi, in order to endorse the compliment by a bow, when he saw a smile, brighter than any he had called forth, irradiate her fine features, as she replied to the remark of a gentleman who stood near, and who seemed to be on the footing of a familiar acquaintance. "Horace Vincent, my old college chum!" he exclaimed, as he looked again. " How are you?" The two gentlemen exchanged  hearty greetings, both equally pleased at having met. "Are you a D. D. yet, Vincent? Settled over a flock?" CL Not at present," replied Horace. "I am not quite ready to receive any call that might be made me." Just then the busy hum of voices seemed to subside some- what, and Mrs. Goodrich announced that gifts were about to be distributed. Horace Vincent offered his arm to Naomi, just as Percy Bancroft bowed before her, asking for the honor, but too late to secure her attention, as he had hoped. The young Jew- ess had spoken but a few words in his hearing, and he felt curious to know if it was in his power to call up so beautiful an expression as that which flitted across her face at the mo-  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7355-00000060"/> "6        INTO THE LIGHT. ment when she had replied to his old classmate, who seemed altogether too happy with his lovely charge. Bancroft's fickle, inconstant nature had never been balanced by a gen- uine attachment, and therefore he craved the approbation of the few whom he thought worth noticing; and, remembering with pleasure the unspoken tribute to his conversational powers that had been involuntarily given by the soft, blue eyes near him, he turned and offered, his arm to Grace Vin- cent, receiving a smiling assent; for she was predisposed to be cordial to her new acquaintance, having heard her brother speak of him in high terms. She felt that he had a gener- ous, perhaps devotional nature, from the few enthusiastic sentences which had fallen from his lips, relating to human freedom and progress, and his glowing eulogies of the time and season. Her pure and transparent character did not apprehend that much which is elevated and noble in senti- ment is sometimes spoken to furnish a well-rounded period. The little girls and the gayly-dressed company passed down to the alcove at the end of the drawing-room, where stood, upon a mossy mound, an immense Christ- mas-tree, filled with rare and beautiful gifts, appropriate for the season, with the name of each visitor attached. Julia Carrington and the twins stood upon white pedestals, enwreathed with evergreen, while below others were in at- tendance to receive from them the articles taken from the tree. Laura Vincent had been among the most active, when she suddenly found her own name upon a card which was attached to a beautifill stand for ink and pens. It flashed upon her at once that this was Julia's method of repairing the wilful accident which had destroyed her own; and, looking up at   t the slight form which stood so gracefully above her, she saw in the bright face, that looked almost handsome, a sweet, ill-  genuous look that seemed to say, ("I would atone for the past." "O Miss Hammet, here is your name attached to a volume   INTO THE LIGHT.         117 T of Tennyson's poems i " said Gabrielle Armstrong, holding  up a handsome volume, with gilded clasps and Turkey       f binding.                   W  t Naomi received it rather reluctantly, but appreciated the delicate attention which prompted the gift. Horace took the book from her hand, and read a few lines from  "Maud" in a singularly melodious voice, the echo of which formed a pleasant melody in Naomi's ear for days after. The gigantic tree was quickly shorn of its fruits. The presents were judiciously adapted to each. All were re- membered, through the care of Mrs. Goodrich, whose execu- tive abilities were remarkable, and who did well and promptly whatever she undertook. Mr. Carrington was in the highest spirits. His nephew divided his attentions with much tact among the groups of young girls, lingering, however, near Laura as often as any excuse offered. Gladly would he have escorted her to the supper-room, but his post was by the side of his cousin Julia, her father leading the way with Mrs. Goodrich. Flowers, wreaths, and evergreen decorated the hall, and a most lavish entertainment was furnished the guests. There was some wit, and a general overflow of good feeling from all parties. All felt that they had passed a merry and a happy Christmas. Soon the carriages began to arrive, and the young people, with bright faces and joyous hearts, were wending home- ward. Naomi, assisted by Grace Vincent, arrayed Gabrielle and Gazelle for their evening ride. Sam, the coachman,had drawn up the carriage directly in front of the spacious door- way, as Horace Vincent stood ready to hand them in. After seeing that the little girls were safely seated, and Naomi well protected with shawls, which he carefully folded around her, he took her hand, and, with a lingering pressure, said, in low tones, full of emotion, - "I have to thank you, Miss Hammet, for one of the most  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7355-00000061"/> 'll8        INTO THE LIGHT. pleasant evenings of my life. It has, indeed, been to me a happy Christmas in every sense, and one that will ever be remembered with pleasure." "The renewal of our acquaintance," replied Naomi, frankly, " has, I confess, delightfully varied the dull mo- notony of my daily experience. Life is not altogether cheerless when we have the solace of true friendship; and I doubt not I may count you as one true friend,at least, Mr. Vincent?" Horace was tempted to reply, warmly, "Now and for- ever; " but, fearing to startle the sweet unconsciousness and simplicity of her manner, he only bowed low and respectfully as the carriage rolled away. CHAPTER XVI. That joyous strain Wake, wake again I O'er the dead stillness of my soul it lingers. Ring out, ring out, The music shout I I bear the sounding of thy flying fingers; And to my soul the harmony Comes like a freshening sea. C. P. CRANCH. i THE next morning Grace Vincent and Laura were seated in their pleasant breakfast-room, talking about the Christmas party, when their brother entered, and interrupted the con- versation. "What did you think of her, Grace?" he asked. "Of whom?" replied his sister, demurely, although she knew perfectly well that it was the fair Jewess who filled his thoughts.   INTO THE LIGHT.         119 "The sweet singer of Israel," he answered, speaking in a clear, bright, ringing tone, that indicated a secret conscious- ness of some hidden joy that enwrapped his whole being,- all this, too, in consequence of a few magic tones that had entered his soul, and met a swift response from his inmost and best affections. "She seemed to have perfect command of the instrument, and her voice is magnificent," replied Grace. "And is that all the impression she made upon you?" said Horace, smiling. 1 I think she is perfectly beautiful!" interrupted Laura. "I don't know what it was, especially, that charmed me, but I felt almost like loving her at once." "Perhaps," said Grace, who seemed determined that he should not forget her ancestry, " it was because of her Jew- ish origin." "' I think she is more than half a Christian," replied her brother, " from some sentiments which fell from her lips last evening." "' Almost thou persuadest me to be,"' said Grace, with a slight smile, which had rather a satirical expression, but which changed to one of real amusement, at the sportive mischief of her sister's next sally. "Brother Horace, ask Grace what she thinks of Percy Bancroft!" exclaimed Laura. "If that stately and splendid autocrat were asked a similar question in regard to her, he would say, I met a wood anemone so pure and white, I quaffed its fragrance, and I would fain have worn it in my bosom; but as I gazed, behold! an eastern rose of match- less beauty divided my admiration, and the sweet-wood flower was for a time forgotten.' Look well to your laurels, brother 'Horace! There stands a rival, perhaps, ii the way, that may dispute the prize." Horace had noticed the attentions of Bancroft to his sis- ter Grace, and glanced at her when he heard Laura's sportive sally; but her calm exterior gave no evidence that she felt j  '  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7355-00000062"/> 120       INTO THE LIGHT. at all interested. Her nimble fingers -were busily engaged upon some brilliant worsted work, and she seemed fully de- termined to ignore the subject. She was startled into some- thing like animation, however, a moment after. "As true as fate, here comes the gentleman himself!" cried Laura. "I shall disappear, as men of his age detest school- girls." Horace was amused when he noticed the vivid blush that overspread the features of his sister as she heard the garden gate swing to, and a firm, elastic step upon the gravelled walk. Without ceremony, Horace opened the door, And hailed his friend with a cordial welcome. "I came," said he, " to see you this morning, lest you might return to the city before we had formally renewed our college acquaintance ; and I hope to have more than one pleas- ant chat relating to old times. Ah! Miss Vincent," he con- tinned, " you look as fresh as if you had not been out rather late last evening. You are quite well, I hope, and I trust feel no ill effects from it?" "None in the least, Mr. Bancroft. We go so seldom to a party, that one innovation but slightly ripples the current of our quiet lives. My grandfather was the only one who felt any inconvenience; for, being partially deprived of the use of his limbs, he depends much upon our presence, and we generally devote ourselves, at evening, to his comfort and amusement." Percy watched the quiet ease and modest self-possession of the fair girl before him, and thought how he would like to see her eye brighten and color deepen at his approach; won- dered if her heart was untouched, and ended by resolving that he woull cultivate her acquaintance, and prove if she  1 was as insensible as she appeared. After a pleasant talk with her brother, he seated himself near the little table on which stood her work-basket, and, draw- ing it near him, lifted a skein of scarlet worsted, and asked if he might do service, in a Imightly way, by holding it while   INTO THE LTOHT.         121 she wound. All the time he had' been talking with Horace he had observed the diminution of the little ball she was net- tingo from, and just as the last strand had been used, offered his services, so that she could not refuse. Just in the least degree embarrassed, Grace smiled, and, opening the skrein, placed it on his hands, while she wound it over her fingers in silence. Looking up as she finished her task, she met a gaze from those clear, gray eyes whicel caused her to droop her own; the admiration was too evident to be mistaken; yet the look was a respectful. one, .anld his next remark diverted her thoughts from herself to a theme which caused her to be all attention. "By-the-by, Vincent, where did you become acquainted with that charming lady, with the 'ebon locks and starry eves '? Her: mind seems highly cultivated, and I should think her something more than a mere governess." "She was the daughter of one of the wealtliiest Jews of New York city, a merchant; but he made an extremely bad failure, and left her nothing but those accomplishments with which she is so richly endowed," replied Horace, evsading the first question asked, and changing the topic of conversation as quickly as possible. Laura's saucy banter led him to suspect a deeper motive than was apparent from those careless questions. HHe knew that Percy Bancroft was talented and original, and therefore felt a jealous fear lest those powers might be brought to bear upon the heart he was resolved to win. Too infatuated had he become to reflect upon the difference of faith, which once caused him to hesitate. Her evident delight at meet- ing him -was enough to set aside every scruple, and cause him to persevere. Yet not without player was the resolution taken; for he who had hitherto been a faithful disciple of our Lord had committed his ways unto him, and asked divine guidance. Mr. Bancroft soon took his leave, and Grace sat for some time after in a sort of pleasant dream. Among all the gen- tlemen she had ever seen, he was the first to awaken the least "  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7355-00000063"/> 122        INTO THE LIGHT. emotion in her heart. She wondered if she would ever see him again. As she asked herself the question, her eye fell upon a handsome pair of gloves, which had been carelessly left by their entertaining visitor, and a slight smile curled her lip as she laid them away carefully in her work-basket, and went about her daily duties with a cheerful, hopeful spirit, thinkings the future mnigaht reveal to her a newer and perhaps higher phase of existence. In the mean time, quite indifferent to her sister's visitor, Laura Vincent had been toAunt Hannah, the house-keeper, and obtained a cold chicken, a couple of pies, and -a small loaf of cake, all of which she packed nicely in a covered basket, and, throwing on her hood and cloak, she tripped along over the light snow, which had fallen during the night, to the humble home of Agnes Ray. So clear was the frosty air, so deeply blue the sky, and bright the winter sun, that Laura could scarcely repress the desire which she felt to sing aloud. Youth and health, and a heart untrammelled by care were hers; but few of life's -shadows had yet rested upon that fair and sunny brow. Keeping time to a tune which she was humming softly, and looking down upon the sparkling snow, that was crusted over just enough to receive the im- pression of her fairy foot, and leave the prints as perfectly formed as a plaster mould, she did not observe the approach of two gentlemen, who were arm-in-arm, walking rapidly to- wards her. "'Harry Winthrop, look at that young girl, will you?" said his companion, a brother student and an amateur artist. "I How picturesque she looks, with that little red cloak on, and the white cloud over her head! Observe the crimson and white border that frames her face, - how gracefully the soft, loose folds of zephyr lie piled on one side, while the other is almost plain, giving a piquant, jaunty look to the head. See those chestnut curls that have fallen over the hood attached to her cloak, --how rich are their hues! how, beau- tiful 'the contrast! While that closely fitting black boot, cov-   INTO THE LiCGHT.        1 3 ered with a tiny rubber sandal, is enough to set a sculptor half wild to take a model of the foot it so enviously conceals. And you cannot deny, Harry, that the little covered basket which she carries so lightly upon her arm completes the picture of as bewitching a little gipsy as you ever saw." "Be quiet, Austin Somers!" said Halry, in a low voice. "That is Miss Laura Vincent, the young girl who took my heart captive the first time I saw her. She is as lovely in mind as in person." "Does she carry it in that basket, think you?" said his companion, demurely. Harry did not reply, for at that moment he was seen and recognized by Laura, who answered his merry greeting with a laughing reply, feeling just a little embarrassment, how- ever, enoughll to deepen the roses on her cheek, and increase the brilliancy of her fair complexion, as she was introduced to his companion. The impulse to explain why she was laden with that ap- parently heavy basket was hard to resist; but she felt that it was a false shame that prompted the desire, and that it would appear like proclaiming her good deeds. This was not her nature, for she forgot a favor done to anothler as soon as it was performed; and, with a simple "Good-morn- ing, gentlemen," she went on her way, unheeding their evi- dent desire to detain her a moment or two longer. "Diamonds! pearls! and rubies!" exclaimed Austin Somers; " those teeth are even and white as pearls! That smile was enchanting! Eyes like flashing diamonds, and ruby lips that-" "Stop your heroics, Austin, and be serious; for it is a serious thing with me, I assure you." "So I suppose," replied his- companion; "not the least doubt of it! A diagnosis of your case would read thus: Mental equilibrium unsettled; quickened pulsation of the heart that may prove chronic; tendency of blood to the cheeks and brow at any unexpected meeting; and nervous  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7355-00000064"/> INTO THE LIGHT. sensitiveness, amounting almost to jealousy. Cause: ' Love's young dream."' And then commenced humming, - "'I am o'er young to marry yet.' "   Harry Winthrop laughed, but soon relapsed into a brown study; and, taking the first opportunity to bid his companion farewell, hastily directed his steps towards Briarwood Hall. At the door he met his cousin Julia, and inquired for aunt Goodrich. " In the dining-room, I believe," she replied. "Shall I call her?" " No, that is the very place where I wished to find her;" and, with the freedom of one who felt sure of a welcome any- where, he sought and found her quietly directing the ser- vants, and bringing order out of the disarrangements un- avoidably consequent after a large party.  Aunt, have you any of those beautiful French devices and bonbons left that we had last night ?" "Oh, yes," she replied, " there are several of those orna- mental boxes that have never been opened." ' Don't you think it would be a good idea, aunt, to send some of them to an old. gentleman, who is deprived, in a measure, of the use of his limbs, and who would be amused and pleased with their beauty almost as much, I imagine, as a child? The fact is," he continued, with boyish frankness, "I would like to call at Mr. Vincent's, and thought it would be a pleasant gift to take to the infirm old man." "Oh, certainly," replied Mrs. Goodrich, smiling. "I am glad that you are so thoughtful as to consider the deprivations of age. I have no doubt but that you will receive quite as much pleasure as you will confer. Take as many as you like, in welcome, with my compliments." Harry's face flushed a little at her bantering tone, but he took them without any reply, and hastened out, in hopes to meet Laura on her way home.   CHAPTER XVIII.

As Laura approached the home of her protegee,she saw at the window Agnes' bright face, and, a moment after, she came flying out, wild with delight at seeing her young bene- factress, whom she devotedly loved. Laura had taught her to read and sew, her mother not being able to send her to school, " because," she said, " she was afther needing her all the time, she was so sinsible like, to mind the baby. Look at him, Miss Vincent," said the mother. "Is he not an illegant boy?" and she held up a rosy, healthy-looking child, who laughed and crowed a merry Christmas. Laura took him a moment, to the great delight of the mother and Agnes, who was never so happy as when she could stand near her friend, at which time she would slyly hold the fringe of her shawl, or a small portion of her dress. Nothing ever looked so beautiful to her child's eye as the smile upon Laura's face.  Mrs. Ray was loud in the expression of her thanks when she saw the contents of the basket; and with Irish enthusi- asm began to talk of the gooddess and generosity that  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7355-00000065"/> 12(0       INTO THE LIGHT. caused Laura to remember such as they at blessed Christmas time. "And it's meself, miss, that has been filling me heart full of love for ye, and all the world, when I think how the Lord put it into your heart to be kind to the little Agnes; for she has been the best of children ever since ye taught her to read, and she will bring wather, and run ov an errand with- out playing by the way." "Miss Laura," said Agnes, I have done just what you told me to, about saying my prayers when I felt like being naughty; and because you said that God always saw me, and took care of me, I have not felt so much afraid to go about in the dark, when mother sends me down into the cellar for chips. Nobody knows so much as he does, you said; and so he will not let anything hurt me, if I ask him every day to watch, - will he?" "Certainly not, Agnes; but why do you feel afraid in the dark?" "Because," she answered, "Patrick Haynes, who lives next door, told me that when the black night came down horrid things came out, and sometimes they caught up little girls and carried them off. I said that I would scream if anything picked me up; but he said they always had a great pitch plaster ready to clap over their mouths, so that nobody could hear, and that they came about just after dark, and if any little girls were out, their mothers would nevr see  them again." "But what things did he say they were?" said Laura.    1 The child hung her head, and said she did not know, but something dreadful. "Agnes," said Laura, " you believe all that I tell you is I true. Now remember what I  say: there is nothing that will  I harm yo in the night any more than in the day; for God sees just as well at midnight as at noonday; and he takes care always of the little ones who love him; and you must try all you can to be good, and then you will have nothing   INTO THE LIGi-T.        127 to fear. Patrick Haynes talked that way,only to frighten you, and it was very wrong in him to say what was not true."  "'I do try to be good, Miss Laura; andrwhen baby grows heavy, I do not lay him down and let him cry, as I used to, when mother is away, but I try to get him to go to sleep real hard. And when mother wants a pail of water, I bring g it up full, and don't spill half of it on the stairs as I did, because, somehow, I feel that there is something good and kind near me, that I cannot see, whoknows when I do right; and I repeat that verse you taught me." Laura looked upon the little girl with one of those smiles that she so much loved, and, taking from the pocket of her sack a little book of stories for children, she showed her her own name written on the blank leaf, and underneath, "A re- ward for excellence in spelling." For the child had made great progress, with no other aim than that of pleasing her young benefactress, and could read simple stories quite well. 'Oh, thank you, Miss Laura! the first new book I ever had in my life! Is it to be all my own, and nobody else to have any right to it?" "No, not any one unless you choose; but you must read from it to your mother when she has done work, and then she can enjoy it, and you, too. Next time I come, you must repeat to me those verses that are on the last leaf, - will you?" "Yes, indeed!" said the child. " And when baby is old enough, I will teach them to him." Laura gave her a lesson in writing, and then bade her good-by, little dreaming of the beautiful flowers which she had woven that morning into her " life carpet;" of the good seed which she had planted, that would spring up and bear fruit in coming years. But her morning mission was not ' yet accomplished. She had just turned into the main road, when a pleasant voice met her ear, saying, - "Miss Vincent, am I so fortunate as to meet you again I  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7355-00000066"/> 128        INTO THE LIGHT. I wished to inquire if your grandfather is well enough to re- ceive callers?"                        i "Oh, yes, sir," she replied; "he likes society all the more in consequence of being unable to go out to meet it. He has very little change of scene."              I ' I am the bearer of a package to him from the Hall, and   A thought I would like to have the pleasure of delivering it  ;' myself," said Harry, with an air of indifference.  ' About eleven o'clock in the morning is the best time to see him," replied Laura. "He is brighter, and more con-     i versable then. It is almost noon now." "May I call, then, to-morrow morning?" inquired Harry. ' I can fulfil my commission then, and perhaps become ac- quainted with Mr. Vincent. My uncle says that he knew him when in his prime, and that he was one of the first men in the place, as well as one of the most active. How very difficult it is for those who are young, like ourselves, to realize that there will come a time when our physical powers will become so impaired that we shaU not be free to come and go as we will! Sweet as life is, I would not wish to have my days lengthened out to fourscore years, if the choice were given me; would you, Miss Vincent? I do not, myself, think it a pleasant prospect." "But it is possible," said Laura, " to grow old gracefully 8 and happily. I know a lady who is eighty-two, whose so- ciety is more to be desired than that of many half her age. Young persons visit her with the greatest delight, forgetting that she is not young, for her heart will never grow old; and yet she has been an invalid for several years." "Quite enough, I should think, to take the sunshine out of any one," replied Harry.  "I look upon old age very much as some timid natures look upon death, - with won- der, fear, and shrinking. It seems to me like a new exist- ence, a metamorphosis, a something in which I shall have no part. Still I know, of course, that it is the inevitable lot of all who live beyond a certain term of years. How would    I   INTO THE  IGuHT.     --  you feel, Miss Laura, do you think, at beholding the first Why, I suppose," said Laura, laughing, " that with it  would come a sense of dignity, with a larger and broader view , of life's responsibilities. But do not you think that we have chosen a curious theme, we youthful denizens upon life's way? Look yonder, Mr. Winthrop; how would you fancy a lot like that?" and she pointed to an old man, who was coming down the road, dressed in a coarse brown great-coat, and faded gray pantaloons, that were patched with black, and a Kossuth hat, from under which strayed a few gray locks, giving him quite a venerable appearance. In one hand he carried a cane, and the other held a cord, to which was attached a small dog, who was guiding him; and they saw that the man was blind. Winthrop's sympathies were quickly aroused, and he ac- costed him as he drew near with a pleasant good-morning. , Good-morning, young sir," he replied, in a strong Scotch accent. "It is a canny day in which to live and breathe. I feel so grateful to God that he has left me my hearing, so that I can enjoy the kind tones of the human voice, hear the birds sing, and the bees hum, and, above all, hear the gospel preached, the guid Q' my life. Oh, it is so much better to be blind than deaf! I can tell so quickly when a bonny na- ture comes near me; my senses discern the true spirit of the man, or lassie, so much quicker than when I was young and could see. Now I know that you have a blithe and hopeful nature, sir, and the atmosphere which you bring with you is fresh and invigorating as that which blows over the heath- covered hills of Scotland. You may do much good among your fellow-men, if you live with that great aim constantly ' before you. You have a companion, have you not? I thought I heard another step beside your own." '"Ah, Enoch Collins!" said Laura; "I thought I would gee if you would recognize my step before I spoke." "And did I not know that it was a bonny bairn, by the light  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7355-00000067"/> 130       INTO THE LIGHT, and even footfall; one, too, that is destined to bless all Itat come near her, and who has in times past been eyes to toh blind?"                     - "' I am glad you feel so well, Enoch, this morning, and  have so contented a spirit. I have not been down to read to I you the past week, but I shall come in a day or two, and  bring you a book that will tell you about the valleys and streams of your native land."               3 "The Lord bless your kindly nature," he replied. "You have given more than ' one cup of cold water to this little one,' and you shall in no wise lose the reward."      : While he had been speaking, Harry had opened his pocket- . X book, and took from thence a bill, which he handed to Laura, at the same time making a motion towards the blind 'man  that she should not reveal the donor. She thanked him with I a look of pleasure. "Enoch," said Laura, 1" here is a Christmas gift that has been given me for you by a friend. I have no doubt but that you need it, although you never complain."      I "Because, Miss Laura, I have so many blessings that I   do not deserve. Thank the giver a thousand times for charity so timely; for the good woman who permits me to have a shelter beneath her roof has not been paid for three ,i weeks, and this thought began to rest unco heavy upon me.  i He who ' feedeth the ravens' hath heard;" and the blind man raised his old Kossuth with quite a natural grace, and went on his way, L" making melody in his heart," that the way- side meeting had revealed another of the blessings of the Lord. "There, Mr. Winthrop," said Laura, " what do you think of contented and happy old age, notwithstanding poverty and loss of sight?" "I think," replied Harry, that a better lesson on con- tentment it is rare to receive. How little do we realize or appreciate those blessings which come to us as freely as the light and air!" "That old man has known better days," said Laura. "He   INTO THE LIGHT.        131 gave me an account of his reverses and disappointments one day, when I had been reading to him. Belle Somers and I go quite often to hear him talk. He has had a good educa- tion, as you perceive by his language; but his occupationf, that of teaching, failed him altogether when he came to this country, on account of his Scottish accent, and he earned a scanty livelihood by copying for lawyers and others, until his sight failed him; and I believe he would have cheerfully entered the poor-house, had it been deemed advisable; but a few in the village prefer to care for him while he is able to go and come, and enjoy an out-door's ramble. He is the happier for the freedom; and his Christian cheerfulness is performing a mission that benefits all who talk with him. There is nothing assumed; it is so heart-felt that one knows it to be genuine. He has outlived all his kindred." "Do vou mean to tell me, Miss Vincent," said Harry, "that that man has no home, no money, nothind of this world's goods except the charity of the few who provide for him, and that he is always as contented and happy with his lot?" "Certainly, Mr. Winthrop," replied Laura, with deep feel- ing, "because he has within him the Christian's hope and joy, and draws daily from that exhaustless fountain of divine light and peace that flows. out freely to every asking soul. At least, that is what Grace, my sister, says about him." Laura cast down her eyes and blushed as she spoke, for she had forgotten - so deep was her interest in the theme - that it was comparatively a stranger to whom she had been speaking so freely. Harry Winthrop's fine, dark eyes lighted up, as she spoke, with a new appreciation of the value and power of those un- seen spiritual agencies, who minister to the "' little ones of the kingdom " a daily draught of contentment and hope,- pointing them away from earth to the eternal beauty and peace of a world at rest. Not unrecorded was the lesson of the morning upon his youthful heart, given so unexpectedly,  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7355-00000068"/> 132       INTO THE LIGHT. and, indeed, so unconsciously, by his new acquaintance; and with a feeling of respect, mingled with increased admiration, he opened the little gate of the homestead which they had reached, bowed, and left her. "Grace," said Laura, as she entered the house, " who do you think came home with me?" "Indeed, I cannot tell," said Grace. "Belle Somers?" "A medium-sized figure, in a dark-blue coat, and round- top hat, is rather stylish looking, has very white teeth, and a very slight, dark mustache. I cannot testify as to his eyes, for I looked in them but twice, and each time they were a different color." "I recollect him, perfectly," said Grace; " he escorted Julia down to the supper-room, last evening, did he not, - Harry Winthrop?" "Oh, yes," replied Laura; " he it was who brought me the inkstand which Julia gave me, and was so polite that I could not but tell him when he could best see grandfather; and to- morrow he comes to bring something from the Hall." Grace had noticed Winthrop's admiration of her sister, but thought it best not to say much about this meeting, which she suspected was more than chance on his part. She there- fore waived the subject, telling Laura that her French teacher had been and gone. "I did not expect him the day after Christmas, or I should not have gone away this morning. He is a tiresome little Frenchman, because he must do everything by rule. I be- lieve, when he is about to take a seat in a chair, he measures, mentally, the space he wishes to occupy, and is nervous if he happens to get a little on one side. Mr. Harper is a beauty compared to him." "It is not fair to tease him as you do, Laura. Those sud- den starts of yours almost upset him. His health being poor is one reason why he is so excitable." "I confess that I have been rather a refractory pu- pil," said Laura; ' but I heard that he. Was not kind to   INTO THE LIGHT.        133 his wife, and therefore I felt no respect for him. However, I will be immensely proper next time he comes. Will that do, Grace?" "Certainly, if the motive is right; you should pity those signs of weakness, and do nothing to aggravate them." "1 Well, I am a little ashamed when I think of the poor man. How he did jump when I let a heavy book fall, and before he had recovered himself, my skirt caught in the tongs, and down they went, the shovel sliding after with a ringing noise! His eyes stood out like goggles, and he was so pro- I  voked that he shut up the book and asked me if I expected to continue that kind of amusement. I told him that they fell accidentally,- which was true, - and that I would be more careful. I think he was glad that I was away this morning. He shall have nothing to complain of at our next lesson. I am really sorry that I teased him;" and the way- !  ward .but. generous girl began to practise a new piece of music which Horace had brought her. Presently the feeble footsteps of the old gentleman were heard slowly approaching, and he sat down near her and listened with delight to her rapid playing. Long after she had finished practising she played for his amusement until the venerable head was bowed, and he fell asleep in his chair. "You are a dear old man," she murmured, as she gazed on his fine features, upon which the firelight cast a faint, ruddy glow. "I love you much better for your dependence upon us, and for the care you make us; I wonder why it is so!" and she stole gently out of the room with something of the feeling that a tender mother has when leaving a sleeping infant. The next day Harry Winthrop impatiently counted the hours, and ere the clock struck eleven he was on his way to the residence of Mr. Vincent. "I wonder," thought he, " if the little ' gipsy,' as Austin Somers calls her, has cast a thought upon me this morning. Her image has completely filled my mind to the exclusion of everything else.

I shall ponder long before I give my heart away to any bewitching fairy. It would interfere altogether too much with my studies. I ought to have gone back to college yesterday." The door was opened by Aunt Hannah, and Harry entered the neatly furnished parlor and was introduced to old Mr. Vincent by Laura, who had just risen from the piano, where she had been practising, and had observed his approach to the house with an amused smile; for she could not mistake the admiration of the young man, and, although not fascinated herself especially, she was not wholly without vanity that morning, when she put on her blue mering dress, with white collar and cuffs, and a little white embroidered apron, whose pockets she declared she would fill with whatever Mr. Winthrop brought. Grace brought a chair and placed it near the old gentle- man, assuming that the visit was entirely to him. Harry conversed a few moments and then displayed the beautiful French conceits which he had brought. Each one had to be examined and commented on by the delighted old man, and Harry felt that he had provided him with a morning's amuse- ment at least. "Do you play cribbage, Mr. Vincent?"Harry inquired. "Oh, yes!" replied the old gentleman, with animation. "I am very fond of a game; but it is seldom that I find any one ' nowadays' who cares to play. It is a game of a past generation. General Washington and I had a game of crib- bage once, and I beat him; those were good old times!" Harry resolved to learn the game immediately. After pro- longing his call as long as was consistent with politeness, he said, on rising to go, that he would bring a cribbage-board next time he came to the village, and play a game with Mr. Vincent, who was as pleased as a child with the prospect, and thought Harry Winthrop one of the finest young men he had ever seen.   INTO THE LIGHT.         135 "What do you think of him, Laura?" said Grace, de- murely. Laura's rose-bud lips curled a little, and then with a good- humored laugh, she said, ( To confess the truth, I think he is not manly enough. None but a youth would have brought a gift of bonbons like these, although they suit grandfather exactly. My heart is in no danger; if ever I love, it will be a man whose mental acquirements are superior to my own; one that I can reverence as well as love." Grace rather admired the fiank, pleasant manners of Harry Winthrop, and thought what a handsome couple they would make, as far as externals were concerned, but said nothing in his favor. She knew that Laura's remarkable beauty would secure her admirers, and she dreaded the thought of having her affections interested in any one, and began to question whether she had done quite right in accepting the invitation to the Christmas party. Suddenly a rosy blush mounted to her temples as the thought presented itself, that then she might never have met the elegant and fascinating stranger who had caused her heart to throb with emotions altogether new and strange. Half vexed with her tell-tale face, she resolved not to be so silly-as to allow her mind to dwell for another moment upon Percy Bancroft. . Grace Vincent had learned what -it was to control her thoughts, by a system of constant mental discipline, and she knew very well that she could be mistress of any wandering emotion, and by an effort of the will could curb and subdue every vain and foolish fancy; and thus day by day she re- joiced in the innocence and purity of her maiden medita- tions, gradually unfolding the strength and beauty of a true womanhood.  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7355-00000070"/> 136        INTO THE LIGHT.

Mortal, fly from doubt and sorrow; God provideth for the morrow. HEBER. A FEW days after Naomi's return from Mr. Carrington's Christmas party, Mrs. Armstrong came ilto the school-room ostensibly to note the progress her little girls were making, but really to question Naomi in regard to her cousin, Joseph Fleming, who had called again, when she was absent with the children, avowed his relationship, and had made himself so agreeable to the lady, by dint of extreme flattery, that the impression produced had enlisted her greatly in his favor. The fact that he was reputed so wealthy conferred, to her mind, a beauty and charm   upon his otherwise indifferent exterior. "A most agreeable and gentlemanly person called again yesterday, --Mr. Fleming.   He is a relative of yours, is he not, Miss Hammet?" inquired the fashionable mother, while her usually indolent manner seemed pervaded and animated by a keen sense of curiosity as she glanced at the governess, in order to notice the effect of her question. "Yes," replied Naomi, briefly, " on my father's side. We have, however, no acquaintance now; all friendly feeling was set aside at the time of my father's decease, in consequence of some disagreeable circumstances connected with his illness." "Why, I am sorry for that," she replied, indifferently, - at the same time calling Gazelle to her side, and encircling her waist with a broad blue sash, whose costly beauty gratified   INTO THE LIGHT.         137 her taste for display,- " for the reason that I cordially invited him to call often. Such a splendid turnout as he has! Such a lovely span of horses,--cream color and white! I de- clare, I have never seen anything more perfect in its way in the city of New York! He has an exquisite taste, I fancy ;" and the vain woman complacently wound over her fingers her little daughter's golden-brown curls, as she remembered his extravagant compliments to her own beauty and that of her children. "I will take it very kindly of you, lMrs. Armstrong," said Naomi, with quiet dignity, " if you will give orders to the servant to say that I am engaged whenever he calls, as any attempt to renew our former friendship would be entirely useless." -"That is a great pity," she replied, " as I half promised that the children should go to ride with him some day. How- ever, that need not compel your presence, by any means, my dear girl. It seems to me that so trifling an 'affair does not warrant that sad, grieved expression of countenance. The days are past when lovers carry off young maidens by force; and an abduction is almost unknown in this enlightened nineteenth century." Naomi made no reply to this heartless speech, but finished one or two copies in the little girls' writing-books, which'she set in a fair, plain hand, and then called them to put away their maps and prepare for recess. "That gentleman who promised to take us to ride is tall and dark, is he not, mother? I don't like him much," said Gabrielle. "I have seen him more than once looking at us out of the window of the fancy-goods store, in the street below, when we have all been to walk. The same one that came with Victoria Mixer." "Oh, yes!" said Gazelle; "Otis and he are very good friends, because he often stops in the street and gives him a ride, and sometimes lets him hold the lines. Otis thinks he is splendid!" 12* i             &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7355-00000071"/> 138        INTO THE LIGc T. Naomi was astonished at the persevering system her cousin had adopted in losing sight of no method that might facili- tate his familiar entrance into the house which was now her home. It perplexed and troubled her that Mrs. Armstrong still continued to praise him, and she more than half sus- pected the two were in a league against her. Wishing to turn the conversation, Naomi led the little girls to talk of the Christmas party, and the mother became much interested in their animated recital. "t O mother!" at length said Gazelle; " a gentleman who took me down so gently from the pedestal where I stood, said, ' My dear, I congratulate you that you have so lovely a teacher.' And another said, ' She has the sweetest voice in the world.' And another " "That will do, iny dear," said Naomi, gently; " you must not make me sorry that I yielded to your entreaties and came downstairs."' Gazelle threw her arms about her neck, laid her soft velvet cheek beside hers, and whispered, t"Please pardon me; but indeed they were altogether right." "Gazelle, hand me my netting-needle," said Mrs. Arm- strong, sharply, who experienced a slight feeling of jealousy when she witnessed the fond caresses of her daughter. Her children were not in the habit of approaching her in that way. Her elaborate dresses and carefully arranged col- lars and laces forbade it. She had repulsed their early child- ish advances; and their long repressed affection, having burst its bounds, seemed to overflow towards one who always spoke so lovingly and gently as Naomi. "Mamma," said Gabrielle, '"Julia Carrington says that we must come to Briarwood Hall and spend a week; and that we can play Blind man's buff,' and 'What is my thought like,' and ever so many games, and that when the weather is good her father will take us to ride." "Oh, won't it be splendid!" cried Gazelle, clapping her hands. "( Promise me that we may go when they send for   INTO THE LIGHT.         139 us; that's a darling mother;" and she knelt down before lter and kissed her hand gently. Mrs. Armstrong was propitiated by the childish, expressive action, and replied very graciouslyt that there was not much doubt but that they could go, but she would not promise at present. "You should see Julia's friend, Laura Vincent, mother, be- cause they say her eyes are like mine. I am sure I do not know what color they are. I only know that she soughllt me out several times, and gave me her arlm when we were malrch- ing, and never seemed to know that I was lame. Some of the girls would not have walked with me. And then, because she noticed me, I Harry Winthrop invited me to dance with him in the rustic reel; and when Mr. Carrington read my name on the fine gold chain, to which a cross of gold and coral was attached, Harry came up before all the girls and clasped it round my neck." "( Mr. Vincent, Laura's brother, handed me mine," said Gabrielle; "but I like Zella's cross much better than my locket." "Mother, may ,we exchange?" cried Gazelle, eagerly. "I would much rather have the locket; I ivant it for a particular purpose." "Certainly; I have not the least objection," replied- her mother; "but why do you wish to change, my dear?" The child hung her head, for she knew instinctively that her real reason would not please her mother. "Children are the most unreasonable beings! They are never suited, - never know what they want more than five minutes at a time," exclaimed Mrs. Armstrong, as she waited for an answer. At length Gazelle raised her eyes with a brave look, and said, "I thought perhaps some day I might have a photo- graph of my teacher, and it would be such a nice case for it, mamma." "Humph!" ejaculated Mrs. Armstrong; " your mother's  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7355-00000072"/> "O        INTO :THE LiGHT. picture was out of the question in your mind then, of course;" and she hastily rolled up the blue ribbon that was to have served for a sash similar to Gabrielle's, and bidding her, in an irritated tone, stand off of her dress, swept out of tlhe room. "Miss Hammet," said the child, "I did not mean to make mamma so angry. I will not exchange if she does not wish it;" and the red lips quivered, and the dark eyes filled with tears. "That is right, my dear," said Naomi. "Should she re- fer to it again, tell her that you have concluded to keep your own Christmas gift, for you should always strive to please her rather than yourself." This little incident, although trifling in itself, only served to deepen the growing dislike which Irs. Armstrong had conceived for the superior girl, who had been so efficient and devoted a teacher to her children that their improvement was most marked, and she was perfectly aware of the fact. Naomi felt that a shadow had suddenly fallen again upon her weary pathway, for she had resumed her daily duties, after their temporary suspension, with a hopefulness and buoyancy of spirit unknown before. Her mother also seemed more reconciled to constant employment; indeed, her nature had often craved occupation in her luxurious home, where every want had been supplied. In those times, ennui often rested upon her spirit so heavily that she lost all vigor of mind through mere inanition.  Now her mental activities seemed to be in full force, and, instead of blindly assenting to all the ceremonies of Jewish worship, she began to reason more clearly, and sometimes question where she could not understand. Naomi often read to her from the little pocket Testament which had been the gift of Dr. Heber, and light and strength sometimes found its way to their hearts from its inspired pages, and they could not help thinking,- "If such the sweetness of the stream, what must the fountain be I "   INTO THE LIGHT.         141 CHAPTER XX.

ONE by one the weeks stole away, leaving their impress of weal or woe on the busy little world of L-- ; working those changes that form links in the great chain of events, which bind by the force of circumstance the plodding children of earth with untold resistless power. Laura Vincent had left school, and her music lessons, together with her French, oc- cupied the greater part of her time. The thought of having her brother Horace enjoy and appreciate the progress she made, served as a constant impulse to the affectionate girl, and she watched and waited for his return home with great delight. Harry Winthrop had made them a number of visits, but Laura had not encouraged any attempt at a more familiar acquaintance, . and had refused all invitations to walk or ride. There was no silly coquetry in her nature, and, al- though she could not help seeing that she was the sole at- traction that drew him to the house, she never made the least effort to deepen the favorable impression she had uncon- sciously made. She had always felt that it was cruel and wrong for a young lady to encourage the attentions of a gentleman, when she had no idea of returning his regard; and, although Harry Winthrop was a most accomplished youth, possessed of great moral excellence, and, withal, a  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7355-00000073"/> "2        INTO THE LIGHT. handsome fortune, yet her heart never bounded at his ap- proach; and she knew, " for quickly comes such knowl- edge," that she did not, and could not, love him. It was a most unfortunate attachment for Harry, as it in- terfered greatly with his studies; all thought being mergedl in the one idea that he must, and could, gain her affections; and every other aim in life grew insignificant and valueless in comparison. "What is future fame to me?" thought he; "the world's applause is nothing in comparison with one smile from those soul-lit eyes. I would give wealth and honors- all that men most covet--to waken in that young heart one tender thought of love. The sweetest face in the world, the loveliest smile, enthralls my fancy and fills my soul! When I look upon my Greek lesson, I see only the dimpled, rosy 'cheek, and auburn curls that have cast their witching spell o'er heart and brain." Youth and hope go hand in hand, and Ilarry Winthrop as yet had not known what it was to bear up under trial and disappointment. -He will emerge from those purifying, chastening influences a wiser and a stronger man, trusting in the promise, the hope of a clime, where again live in beauty the heart's withered flowers, and the soul never mourns over love's broken ties, with sad unavailing regrets of the past! Although in after years there will often echo through the chambers of memory the wild refrain, "It might have been--it might have been!" as pulse and sense, and thought, and feeling are deeply and painfully stirred, in view of life's lost hopes, its buried joys. Iarrv Winthrop's father had noticed his son's abstracted manner, and thinking it the result of too much study, advised him to take a trip to Europe during the college vacation. Harry replied, " that would depend upon circumstances; perhaps it might be just what he required; ' but seemed so confused and absent-minded, that Mr. Winthrop condescended to joke, - a rare thing, and a relaxation of dignity not often indulged in,- and asked him if he was in love; or was he   INTO THE LIGHT.         143 trying to invent some great thing, or solve some abstruse problem. Harry's face grew crimson as his father spoke, and, making some slight reply, he resolved to visit his uncle's residence the next day, and, if possible, obtain an interview with Laura Vincent. Chance favored him in his plans, for Laura, who had avoided strolling out after sunset for some time, because she did not wish to encounter tHarry, whom she had several times met at that hour, was attracted by the beauty of the evening to walk part of the way home with Belle Somers; who, by the way, was a great admirer of Harry Winthrop, and had several times called when she thought lihe might be at the house. This time, however, she was disap- pointed, and the two girls walked together, enjoying the beautiful sunset, and talking at random at first, until Belle inquired, who Mr. Bancroft came to see so often. "My brother, partially, I suppose," replied Laura. "In- deed, I have never thought much about it. We like to have him come because his conversation always suggests so much material for thought. I told Grace the other day that he re- minded me of some iich mine, from which one could take, when they chose, rare and sparkling gems, that were new and beautiful each day. Grace says, ' he is one of those characters who give to others a mental stimulus which unfolds their best intellectual faculties in a remarkable degree.' I had a little fear of him at first when he came to our house; but after a while I ventured to remain the whole of one evening, and, before I was aware, I had decidedly opposed some of his ideas, and presented my own in contrast, proving unmistakably that he was wrong and I was right; and, from that time, my veneration for his superior intellect has abated somewhat, and I now take the opposition side, sometimes, just to bring him out and amuse my sister with his animation." "That is more than I should dare to do with so great a scholar," said Belle. "What has become of Mr. Winthrop  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7355-00000074"/> "4        INTO THE LIGHT. lately? I thought he was getting to be quite a partial friend of yours, Laura." "Oh, he is deep in the study of law, I presume! Maybe, he will make a Webster, or a Choate, if he reads oIpng enough, and has the right ambition." "Don't you think he is very handsome, Laura? I would give something to possess one of his curls, just for its beauty," said Belle, with affected indifference. "I cannot say that I admire to see a man with curling hair," replied Laura. "I like to see it thrown back from the forehead, with just enough of a wave to be graceful; but where there are decided curls they impart a feminine appearance that takes somewhat from the dignity of the man. You have a fine opportunity, Miss Belle, of asking for a lock of his hair now, for there comes the gentleman in question." Belle laughed, and, with a conscious blush, extended her hand to Harry Winthrop, who had been trying to overtake them for some minutes; while Laura returned his warm and earnest greeting with a little accession of dignity and slight constraint of manner that chilled and embarrassed him. He walked beside them, however, talking mostly with Belle, who was inwardly delighted at the meeting, and talked so fast that Laura did not feel obliged to say much. At length Harry spoke about going .to Europe. "I wonder if either of you young ladies will bestow a thought upon me when I am absent? May I hope that, when you weave L a garland of memory's flowers,' my friend- ship, although but a simple bud, may find a place beside the sweet ' forget-me-not'?" "You are getting quite poetical, Mr. Winthrop," said Belle; '" and I do not wonder that this beautiful evening inspires you. Rest assured that you will not be forgotten, - by me at least." Harry stole a glance at Laura, who was looking down, drawing the elastic cord around her sunshade, and thought   INTO THE LIGHT.        145 he would have given much for such an answer from her as Belle gcave; but just then they reached her hole, and she urged them to come in, saying she would give them some music. Laura did not like the idea of walking home with Harry, and earnestly urged him to go in and leave her. De- lighted at the opportunity of seeing her alone, he replied that he should be lacking most essentially in what he considered politeness, if he allowed her to return without an escort; and that he should hold Miss Somers to her promise of a song the next time he came to L--. They bade each other good-evening, and, before they had walked far, Harry said, "I know not that I ought to ask a place in your friendship, Miss Vincent; but, could I believe that you would sometimes cast a thought upon one whose every dream and aspiration is mingled with your sweet mem- ory, I should be, happy beyond expression." Laura trembled with agitation lest he might grow more explicit, and dreaded being obliged to mortify him by a direct refusal. She quickened her pace, somewhat, simply saying that she could not make any rash proinises, but that they would always be glad to hear from him if he went abroad. Winthrop's voice faltered as he said, "Our acquaintance has been short, Laura, but it has been long enough to color my whole future life my happiness is in your keeping, my heart is yours, and--" { '0 Mr. Winthrop!" interrupted Laura; " please do not say any more! I regret, oh, so much, that you have spoken X thus to me, because I cannot return your regard. I cannot. indeed," she continued, as she observed his fine eyes filled with the tears he could not repress, the disappointment was so keen. "I feel that I have been premature," he said; " but will not time make a difference? If years of devotion, even, were needful - " "No! Mr. Winthrop, do not think I shall ever change, for I feel that it is impossible," said Laura, gently; and she ex- 13  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7355-00000075"/> "6        INTO THE LIGHT. tended her hand, as they reached the house, in token of a final farewell. Harry hesitated a moment, as if he would plead still longer; but pride forbade, and half-ashamed of the tears that had been too apparent, he murmured "good-evening " ill a tolerably firm tone of foice, while Laura knew not whether to laugh or cry.

IN a small, plainly furnished study, in a modest dwelling a little removed from the main thoroughfare in the city of New York, sat the Rev. IIorace Vincent in a musing attitude. He had finished his studies, had graduated, and -the world was now  before him. He had called, during the course of weeks, several times upon the fair Jewess, but at each visit Mrs. Armstrong came into the room, and, by her haughty, supercilious manners, gave an air of constraint to Naomni's demeanor, which she did not feel. This served to discourage Horace, and he began to think the emotion she manifested on the night of the Christmas party was misinterpreted by his too hopeful nature. And then, again, he knew he had no handsome home to offer her. Why should he think of a wife, when a good name, youth, and talent were all, or nearly all, the capital he could command? On that day he had been taking a retrospective thought, and had yielded a little to despondency in view of the future. He leaned his   INTO THE LIGHT.         147, head on his arm and offered a short prayer for strength, for help, and divine guidance; when he again lifted his face, a sweet serenity had overspread every feature. A rap at the door drew his attention, and, opening it, he received from the hands of the servant a letter with his address; soon mastering its contents, he again in iulged in a revery, and this time his. thoughts bore a more hopefull aspect. The letter contained an invitation for him to preach iln the village of L---, where his sisters resided, with a view to a perima- nent position. The parish had heardi him preach, and liked him, and wished him to preach three Sabbaths in succession. Here was an opening, which, if not quite equal to his fondest hopes, was sufficient to permit him to labor for his Master, although in a limited field. Speedily he made his arrange- ments, and the following day was on his way to the quiet re- treat, where loving hearts awaited his coming. All was hope and pleasant anticipation within that happy household. The Sabbath following, Horace preached a sermon which he had already prepared, not without great care, and earnest prayer that it might serve the cause he loved so well. How proudly Grace and Laura looked upon their brother, as he stood in the pulpit that day, with his fine features lighted up with holy fervor; his large brown eyes shedding a soft in- fluence upon the upturned faces of his hearers, who listened attentively to his rich, melodious tones, at first low and sweet, then gradually becoming sonorous and beautifully modulated with every varying sentiment! And feeling deeply and thoroughly the importance of his subject, the magnetic influence of his own convictions appealed power- fully and directly to the hearts of many who listened, and when he closed his discourse there was an unusual feeling of solemnity apparent over the whole congregation. He had been successful! And there was no mistaking his power over the minds of those about him. This was manifested by the increased attention and deference shown him, after the services. 'Squire Carrington and others were loud in his  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7355-00000076"/> "8        INTO THE LIGHT. praises, and Horace Vincent, without one spark of vanity, felt that the satisfaction which he had given was the seal of approbation that the Lord had set upon his ministry; arld, therefore, after preachinr g the two succeeding Sabbaths, he was not surprised to receive a formal call from the deacons of the church to become their settled pastor. He saw before him opportunities of doing much good, feeling that he was called by the divine will to that particu- lar locality; and, having no desire for worldly fame or honors, he hoped to serve the Master faithfuilly, even if he had bestowed upon him but one talent. Minlrled with his thoughts of future usefulness came the sweet hope of se'eing once more the Jewish maiden; and lie resolved to obtain another interview with one in whose preselce he always felt his highest and noblest qualities were calleJl forth. It would yet be many diays before he could visit the city; should he write her a friendly note telling her of his good fortune, and thus indirectly claim her interest? Upon reflection lie re- solved to let the information become a pretext for a friendly call; and with this glad anticipation brightenlin every other hope, he faithfully devoted himself to all demands made upon his time and services. Meanwhile, the steady course of events, without any effort of his own, was about bringing to him the fulfilment of his fondest desires in a manner wholly unexpected. One morning, while writing in the temporary study which he had arranged at the old homestead, he received a call from 'Squire Carrington, who wished to hold a conversation upon church matters, and told him that the parsonage was about being renovated, put in complete repair; and if he preferred to remain in his own home, the house might receive a tenant, the rent to remain at his disposal. "As you are not married, Mr. Vincent, the deacons did not know which you would prefer; but if you choose to keep bachelor's hall, a good house-keeper could be obtained who would serve you with fidelity. The house stands high, sir,   INTO THE LIGHT.          149 overlooks the village, and I must say that from the study windows you have one of the finest views in the country. The church feel an honest pride in having the surroundings of their pastor such as will harmoniously develop his best teachings; and they are so much pleased with their new ministert  tat they will spare no pains in putting it in com- plete order." ".I should prefer moving into the house," said Horace, 1" for various reasons, as soon as it is finished. "Very good, sir. I know that decision will give universal satisfaction. It will give more than one something to do, and many something to think about. I would drive you over, Mr. Vincent, to take a survey this morning, but the ladies want the house to wear its most attractive aspect when seen by the new pastor, and therefore they have del- egated me to request you to delay your visit until you are notified that it is nearly ready for occupancy." With great pleasure, sir," said Horace, smiling. "I have no objection to being matde as comfortable as possible." Horace's time had been so fully occupied with church mat- ters and the installation, that he had scarcely bestowed a thought upon the parsonage, and a new vista seemed opening to him of hope and happiness that was beyond his modest expectations. Mr. Carrington, after a few moments' desultory conversa- tion, arose to take his leave, when drawing on his gloves he mentioned, incidentally, that they expected some visitors, with whonm he seemed acquainted, at the "Hall " the fol- lowing week. "The twins, Gabrielle and Gazelle Armstrong, are coming with their mother, and my girl is delilghted with the prospect, for she absolutely dotes upon those beautiful children. By the way, what a lovely young lady they have for a governess! If I were only a little younger my heart would be taken cap- tive by those magnificent eyes of hers. Depend upon it she has not always been obliged to rely upon her own exertions." 13*  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7355-00000077"/> 150        INTO TVIE LIGHT. "Oh, no, sir," replied Horace; " her father was once one of the merchant princes of Ner York, and his daughter was born and bred in affluencc; he was a Jew, and one of the   i straitest of the sect, but died, I am told, a rejoicing  Christian. His widow and daughter were left nearly penni- less; but they have both proved themselves equal to the    - emergency, and have nobly asserted their independence.     r "How you deepen my interest in the Jewish stranger!" said Mr. Carrington. "If she comes again with the children  I and their mother, she shall be made to feel that we respect  1 and admire her all the more for taking, upon herself the true ) dignity of womanhood."                     I It required some effort of the will to conceal the pleasure ! which the parting words of his new friend gave Horace Vin- cent; and his soul glowed and expanded with thankfulness as he reviewed the way in which the Lord had led and sealed him for the ministry; for he had already realized in part, the promise of Holy Writ, "' Commit thy ways unto the Lord,    l and he shall give thee the desire of thine heart." His pleasant musings were interrupted by the voice of his sister Laura, who asked if she might come in and study her French lesson there, because Percy Bancroft was below reading to Grace. "What difference could that make to you, Laura?" said Horace, curiously. "I hardly know," she replied; " but I could not master a single verb, for every time I looked up, those clear, gray eyes were bent upon me with a half-smiling, half-satirical ex-   h pression; and I felt disturbed by what Grace calls the mag- netism of his presence, and so I made my escape. I think he comes here often enough to become pretty well acquainted with some of the poets he reads from. Don't you think he knows that he has a rich voice, and that he reads beauti- fiully? Grandfather is perfectly fascinated with him, and was almost fretful, yesterday, because he did not call as usual." This question aroused Horace from his own immediate in-   Jj1  1 .N V J sAJ n * , terests, and led him to think that he had been too regardless of the frequent visits of his college friend. He felt that Grace must be the magnet which drew him so frequently to the house, and, giving Laura an indifferent reply, he resolved to note more carefully the progress of an intimacy that seemed to be rapidly growing into something more than fi iendship. Percy Bancroft was not such a man as he would have chosen for his beloved sister, for the reason that his sentiments in regard to religion were based upon a platform that encouraged scepticism. Iorace put aside his writing, and telling Laura he would returi' presently, went down to meet his friend. When he entered the parlor, he thought he had never seen Grace look more beautiful. Her usually pale cheek was suf- fused with a color rich and deep as the " innermost heart of a rose; " her large blue eyes had a soft, happy light in them, as she looked upon her companion, who had, by his earnest, animated manner, evidently been successfully pleading his suit as a lover only can plead.  It is woman's nature to yearn and droop for love, -- to shrink in agony froin a lonely path, -to long for some sup- porting arm on which to rest her weakness; and it is woman's doom too often to find on earth no loving rest, and therefore is her lot so sad." But when the suitor comes endowed with every manlzy grace, with truth and fidelity written upon every lineament of his speaking face, how can she doubt, or even dream, that disappointment, keen and bitter, is lurking like a dark shadow in the distance; that will in time rest as a cloud of sorrow over the memory of those blissful moments of love and happiness? Percy Bancroft did not relinquish the hand which he held when Horace entered, but simply said, "Vincent, I know the exquisite happiness of loving and being beloved. May I, shall I be your brother by adoption, by virtue of my love for this dear one, who will one day, I trust, be all my own?"  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7355-00000078"/> 152 INTO THTE LIGHT. Horace was too much agitated at first to reply; he would have chosen differently for lis darling sister, but now he would not pain her by manifesting any doubt as to the wis. dom of her choice. Pressing PelcJy's han cordially, he ut- tered a few kindly words, enough to put them both at ease, kissed Grace's glowinrg rncheek, and left them to the happiness of each other's society. He returned to his stud, however with a heavier heart than when he left it. WTealth would be hers, as the wife of Percy Bancroft; position also; bult was his character one that suited the beautifuliy harmonious slf- denying one of his sisterGrace? Her vey getleless, he feared, would soon cease to charm such a man of the world as Bancroft; still, he would try and hope that a bright future might be hers. When he told Laura of the new tie that was about to ad- mit another into their little family band, she showed more emotion than hlle had thought such a child capable of. Ire still thought of her as a child, although she was just ' sweet sixteen," yet her playful, wilful ways, at times, made her ap- pear much younger. Her face crimsoned, and then grew very pale, and she petulantly exclaimed, t rhat i'ight has he to admire my ister!" and then burst into tears, for in that moment she felt that a warmer interest than she knew I ad been growing in her heart for the elegant and accotplished scholar, who had bestowed upon her man an admniring gaze when she had unreservedly avowed her sentiments respecting any author or fine passage he might have been reading aloud to her sister; and once, after a burst of enthusiasm on her part, he had taken her delicate hand in his, and, with a scarcely perceptible pressure, raised it to his lips while he sail,-- "Well done, little one! beautiful one! you will become an enthusiast, a woman of genius if you cultivate this keen appreciation of poetic beauty." That look and pressure lingered in her memory long after he had forgotten the thrilling touch of her little hand. He was not conscious how much her bright face and sportive wit   JIiNTO TIE LIGET.        153 had often contributed to make the hour passed in Grace's society so rich in intellectual enjoyment. He would always ask for her, if absent when he came, and, before she left school, would often wait her return ere he said farewell, feel- ing the want, he knew not why, of her sweet presence. Laura understood, partially, why she felt so rebellious, - so unwilling to resign her sister. She would not analyze her feelings, but had a glimmering idea why it was that she had always felt like running away when Harry Winthrop came to the house, and had so promptly and decidedly discouraged his addresses. She was thlloroughly unhappy, she scarcely knew why. She heard a carriage drive up to the door, and, looking out, saw it was Bancroft's '" coupee," and knew that her sister was going to ride. She had been with them sev- eral times, and, expecting to hear her name called, hastily closed the door, hopingto shut out sight and sound. "Where is Laura?" cried Percy. " We cannot go without our sunbeam." Aunt Hannah, the house-keeper, came upstairs and urged her to go down, but she pleaded a headache, and would not be persuaded. Grace called, "l Laura, dear! would you like to go. and ride with us?" " Thank you, I believe not this morning; I do not feel quite well, and do not care to go, - at least not to-day," said Laura, by an effort, in her usual cheerful tones. It was fortunate for her that no one was present but Hor- ace when the news of her sister's engagement was commu- nicated to her. He felt uneasy and puzzled at her strange manner, but the real truth never dawned upon him. Laura's pride came to her aid, and she resolved to appear, if possible, the same. She went downstairs and began to practise her music lessons. Horace heard the tones of the piano, and it greatly relieved his mind, for he concluded that it was only some childish freak that made her perverse and  fretful.  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7355-00000079"/> 154        INTO THE LIGHT. She played several difficult pieces, then took up a book and carefully read over the passages that were marked by Percy Bancroft's hand. Then she thought of the time when Grace would leave the homestead, perhaps never to return; of herself alone, without the sweet companionship and coun- sel that had been hers so long; and, giving way to a pas- sionate burst of grief, she bowed her head on her .arm. The long curls concealed her face, and she neither heard nor saw they had returned, or that some one had entered the room and stood beside her. "Sweetest, dearest sister! May I not call you so?" mur- mured a familiar voice. "What is the cause of these tears? I would not have a feather's weight of care rest upon thy young head. Can I, may I comfort you? Will you tell me what troubles you, little one?" Laura could not hear that voice and those accents without emotion; those tender epithets she felt ought not to be ad- dressed to her while her mind was in such a state, and hear- ing the entrance of her sister went out hastily, ashamed at having lost her self-control, when she intended to be so brave. Bancroft left, shortly after, for New York, expecting to re- turn in a week or ten days. Grace never realized how dear he was to her heart until that parting, when he left her with the memory of his first kiss upon her lips, and a tumultuous happy joy in her heart, from the consciousness that he was all her own. Bancroft felt disappointed that Laura did not come down when he left. He experienced a vague, unsatisfied yearning, for which he could not account. The startling inquiry came up in his mind; could he be mistaken?  Was it, after all, that wild, capricious child, that filled his heart, who had al- ways been an unceasing delight to his eyes, whenever he had been in Grace's society? But yet she was not a child, for why did he imprint a kiss once upon her soft hand, which he had intended to place upon her lips? The womanly dignity she assumed by a sudden transition, made even him, accom-   INTO THE LIGHT.         155 plished man of the world as he was, diffident before her. He remembered that he looked at her speaking countenance for approbation, when in reading he came to any stirring pas- sages, far more often than that of her sister's; and yet the sweet presence of Grace, he had felt, was all he desired, until he had found Laura in tears; then he would have given worlds to have clasped her in his arms, and soothed her grief. What was the cause of those tears? Had he awakened an interest in that young heart unintentionally? He could not recall aught in her manner previously that would lead to such a belief, for Laura was free and unembarrassed before him until they last met, and only then had he known how inex- pressibly tender was his own feeling in relation to her. A prey to conflicting emotions, he took his way to the city thoroughly dissatisfied with himself, for he greatly feared that he had made a fatal mistake. CHAPTER XX l. O Father, Lord I The all Beneficent I I bless thy name That thou hast mantled the green earth with flowers I HEMANS. "Each blossom that adorns our path, So joyful and so fair, Is but a drop of love divine That fell and flourished there." NAOM soon became convinced beyond a doubt that Mrs. Armstrong had openly espoused the cause of her cousin, Jo- seph Fleming, who seemed to possess a singular power over this proud woman upon so short an acquaintance. One morning, after the children had gone to walk, she sat down near Naomi, and commenced talking again of the fine  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7355-00000080"/> 156        INTO THE LIGHT. equipage which Mr. Fleming owned, and of his stately man- sion, one of the finest in the city. There was a malicious sparkle of triumph in her eyes as she spoke, for she remem- bered that the palatial residence once occupied by the young governess made her own look humble in comparison. "Oh, yes, madam," replied Naomi, "I know the house very well, as you are doubtless aware, - the pleasant home of my childhood and youth. It fell into Mr. Fleming's hands after my father's decease." "Yes, I know," replied Mrs. Armstrong; "but I under- stand from him that he bought it of the creditors for the sole purpose of returning it to you when you will accept of his addresses. A most princely gift surely!" "Which do you mean, the house or himself?" said Naomi, demurely. "Both, my dear! Few young ladies would hesitate in view of such an establishment. Victoria Mixer has put forth every wile and fascination that she possesses to attract the rich Jew."  "Were he the owner of both continents I would not, volun- tarily, spend one hour in his society, if by so doing I could become the possessor of the whole," said Naomi; while the rich blood mounted to her cheeks, and her eyes sparkled with a scorn, before which even Mrs. Armstrong felt uncomfortable. "It may be enough for you to know, madam, that there are some memories connected with my father's sickness, loss of property, and subsequent death, that would render it un- natural and impossible that I should ever wed one, who, for his own selfish purposes, succeeded in bringing about so mel- ancholy a downfall of our fairest hopes." Just then Mrs. Armstrong exclaimed, "Look, how beauti- fully those horses prance! I do believe,- yes, it -is Mr. Fleming and Victoria Mixer." Naomi cast a glance from the window and beheld the spare form of her cousin with the young lady seated by his side, very showily attired, her bright, black eyes actually dancing   INTO THE LIGHT.         157 with delight when she detected the graceful figure of Naomi, and saw that they were observed. Nodding and smiling, she threw a kiss at Mrs. Armstrong, and raised her eye-glass to take a survey of Naomi as they dashed by. Victoria knew not that it was a concerted plan, if possible, to excite the jealousy of her fair rival, and, therefore. her vanity and am- bition were alike gratified. As any change was a relief to Naomi, and absence from the proximity of her cousin gave her a sense of security and rest, she hailed with pleasure the prospect - that so much delighted the twins -of visiting at "Briarwood Hall;" more than that, she knew that it was near the country home of Horace Vincent; perhaps they might meet once more, and her heart throbbed with joy at the thought. Mrs. Armstrong was glad of a relief from even the slight care which she bestowed upon her children, and concluded to let Naomi take them without her, as a large party was to be given the next week by the Mixers, and her dress was yet to be made. It was arranged that they should start the following day; and Naomi that night took out her pocket companion, the little Testament Dr. Heber had given her, and read in Hebrews, 12th chapter, "I will boldly say the Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me; for he hath said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee." Slowly, but surely, the mind of this daughter of a de- spised iace had been enlightened by the divine light of the gospel, and she was a believer, although she scarcely knew herself to be one. She had with tears cried, "Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief; " and he who never turns away from that cry had said unto her, "Daughter, go in peace." She now longed to hear the Word preached in a Christian church. That desire was to be gratified sooner than she dreamed. The ensuing day the children were up with the sun; their trunks were packed and they all sat down to an unusually merry breakfast. Mr. Armstrong leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily several times at the witty repartees that "  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7355-00000081"/> 158        INTO THE LIGHT. flowed and sparkled from their childish lips, owing to the pleasurable excitement of the prospect of new scenes and a delightful ride to Briarwood Hall. The snowy season was over. April, capricious April, had come, " when the cool winds feel softer, and the rain falls in the beaded drops of summer time;" and, to the great de- light of the twins, this day proved to be one of spring's love- liest creations. The air was balmy, the sky of a brilliant blue, and the sun wore that mellow, golden light that is sometimes seen early in the season as the herald of ap- proaching summer. The carriage windows were thrown wide open, and both Naomi and the children enjoyed keenly their escape from the confinement of the city; something like her old vivacity returned, and, when the carriage reached the Hall, she seemed almost as much a child as the rest. Julia stood upon the steps without her bonnet, ready to embrace Gabrielle, who was her especial favorite. Mr. Car- rington and Mrs. Goodrich were waiting in the hall to receive Mrs. Armstrong. The children bounded out, followed by their governess. In answer to their inquiries, the twins re- plied, (' This is our mother," pointing to Naomi, " for the present; our city mamma could not come, and we bear her regrets." Naomi could not have wished a more cordial welcome. Mrs. Goodrich led the way to her chamber, and showed her a room opening out of her own for the children. "Now, my dear," she said, " make yourself and your in- teresting charge as much at home as possible; and should you happen to require anything, ring for the servant, and it shall be supplied. I hope we shall see you below when you are rested." Naomi thanked her with one of those expressive smiles that had first won her interest, and said she already felt at home. She stood a moment at the window, and a magnificent extent of country met her view; the prospect was enchantincg. The village below, with its white houses and modest church spire,   INTO THIE LIGIT.        159 seemed bathed in the golden sunlight; the distant hills looked green and almost summer-like. She threw up the window and the scent of the lilac blossoms came stealing upon her senses, and she mentally quoted, "Grace and beauty everywhere are blushing into life. How I would like a quiet nook yonder in that peaceful valley, ' the world for- getting, by the world forgot !'" A rap at the door caused her to open it, and Julia stood there dark and sparlkling, with those fair children on each side of her, their arms intertwined, and their cheeks glowing with the exercise they had already taken in the grounds in front of the Hall. "Miss Hammet," said she, "come and look at our daffo- dils and jonquils on the sunny side of the house; they are so beautiful you can almost see them grow." Naomi threw on her rigolette and ran down with them. A heavy pressure seemed taken from her; she breathed a lighter atmosphere, so buoyant were her spirits on that bright morning. While they were examining those delicate nurs- lings of spring, whose expanded blossoms seemed to return smile for smile, Naomi heard a voice which made her heart bound, repeating in deep, rich musical tones,- " A violet, by a mossy stone, half-hidden from the eye." Turning suddenly, with undisguised delight, she cried, "Why, Mr. Vincent ! is it you? What a pleasant surprise !" Was this the reserved, dignified young lady he had seen at Mrs. Armstrong's? Her hand was extended, and it was im- possible for him to relinquish it without pressing it warmly. A vivid blush overspread her cheeks; but she talked on with that clear, ringing, joyous tone, that indicated the over- flow of a heart that was too happy to disguise its emotions. "Oh, I have so much to tell you, Miss Hammet; ]  have wished greatly to see you, and was making arrangements to visit New York for no other purpose. When I have an op. portunity I will explain to you more fully." &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7355-00000082"/> 160        INTO THE LIGHT. "Miss Gabrielle, you have had a charming day for your ride." "Oh, yes!" replied Gabrielle; - we are prepared to enjoy to  the utmost our visit in the country. Julia has promised us a ride every day, and we expect to have the best time in the world. We are going now into the greenhouse." "Yes," said Julia; " if you will come with us, Mr. Vincent, I will show you the sweetest moss rose-bush in full bloom, you ever saw, and you may pick whatever flowers you choose."' She led the way, and they soon stood in an atmos- phere of sweets and loveliness. Flowerincg vines formed a shady arbor at one end of the spacious conservatory. A fountain threw its silvery spray over aquatic and Asiatic plants, that clustered in rich luxuriance around the border of a  marble basin, near which a snow-white marble fawn re-, clined, across whose breast an ivy vine was wreathed in rich artistic beauty. Naomi, whose passion for flowers was un- bounded, revelled in the delicate and subtile charms they cast around her. She paused before a rose-bush laden with ex- quisite bloom, and, bending down a branch, on which hung, a half-opened bud, inhaled its fragrance, exclaiming, , How beautiful!" As she turned to speak to Julia, Horace pressed the bud which her hand had touched, to his lips, and then presented it to her, with a glance at once inquiring and tender. "May I," said he, "ask you to accept of one of na- ture's brightest creations, as a memento of our unexpected meeting?" "There are times when the spirit receives whole volumes of thought on its unwritten leaves;" and at that moment electric-like, from heart to heart, there passed a slight con- sciousness of the tender interest felt by each. Naomi's hand trembled as she received the gift; there was a depth of softness, a timid tenderness in her expression, as she raised her eyes to his, that thrilled his heart with a blissful hope, - that she, who had at times seemed proud and cold as a dis-   INTO THE LIGHT.        161 tant star, might bestow upon him the wealth of that love which he courted beyond aught on earth. With the versatility of youth, the twins and their compan- ion had explored the beauties of the greenhouse, and had gone in search of new amusements. Gabrielle was calling earnestly from the hall, wild with childish delight, - "Miss Hammet, please come and teach us how to play battledore." Naomi readily answered the call, feeling that she had per- haps given attention too willingly and obviously to her fasci- nating companion. Horace, instinctively apprehending the feeling, bade her farewell, telling her he hoped she would be in church the next day, with the family. He knew that she had not heard of his settlement, and he wished that she should test and approve him as a preacher. He noticed, as they parted, that she wore the moss rose- bud in her bosom, and he thought it a beautiful and appro- priate symbol of her radiant loveliness. Yielding to the exhilaration of the hour, Naomi stood in the hall, as much a child as the rest. Her clear, musical laugh rippled forth in bird-like tones as she noticed their awkward attempts to keep the bird on the wing. Mr. Carrington entered while they were playing, and as he stood looking upon the happy group, he sighed as he remem- bered that youth was gone from him forever, and that his hope of ever appropriating loveliness like hers was a delusive dream. He had seen Horace Vincent a few moments that morning, and he had also seen him walking with ther fair guest, and the thought occurred to him, "What a handsome couple they would make!" and he resolved to invite him to the house as often as possible during her stay. That night, as Naomi sat in her room, reviewing her inter- view with Mr. Vincent, Gabrielle stole up behind her chair and whispered,- "*   &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7355-00000083"/> 162        INTO THE LIGHT. "Miss Hammet, what have you done with that rosebud Mr. Vincent gave you?" "Why do you wish to know, my dear?" "Because he kissed it before he gave it to you." "What is that, Gabrielle? You talk enigmas." "Why," she replied, "I saw him, after you had admired the flower, draw the bud down and kiss it.  What did he do that for, do you think?" "Because he loves everything that is beautiful in nature, I suppose," said Naomi, with an amused smile. "Then I think he ought to love you, Miss Hammet," said Gazelle, who had come in unperceived, and was listening to the conversation. Naomi paid no attention to that remark, but proceeded to prepare them for retiring. "Miss Hammet," said Gazelle. "I wish you would read to us out of the little Testament you have, and explain as you read. Talk to us about Jesus as you did the other day; for you speak his name so tenderly that I like to listen." Naomi felt incompetent to lead those young minds herself, but she seemed to realize that the Scriptures were sometimes opened to the comprehension of children without any extra- neous teaching; and so she read a portion of a chapter in John, where Jesus reveals his love for children, accompanied with a few touching remarks. Quite satisfied, their fair young heads had not long pressed the pillow before they fell into the sweet and dreamless sleep of childhood.   INTO TEE  LIGHT,        163  CHAPTER XXTTII "A pearl of price to mortals given Art thou, blest day of all the seven." "Sleep, sleep to-day, tormenting cares, Of earth and folly born " Solemnly sang the village choir On that sweet Sabbath morn. LONGFELLOW. NAOMI awoke the next morning with a quiet joy at her heart that was a fitting preparation for the enjoyment of the holy day. Mr. Carrington and Mrs. Goodrich seemed to vie with each other in showing her every attention. The morn- ing was beautiful, and the church bells chimed upon her ear with a soothing, hallowed influence. Mr. Carrington's family carriage conveyed them all to church. As they rode along they saw the small, but tasteful and picturesque edifice in the distance, towards which many were soberly wending their way on foot, and a few in car- riages. All were anticipating a rich feast in spiritual things from their new pastor. As they advanced up the isle, to the 'squire's pew, many an admiring glance was cast upon the elegant stranger, and the two lovely children by her side. There was one heart that throbbed wildly when she first entered, - one mind that, for the moment, was filled with her sweet image to the exclusion pf everything else. Then reason, religion, asserted their supremacy, and, breathing a short prayer that the eyes of his soul might be fixed steadfastly upon divine things, he rose majestic over sense and self, and seemed to be filled with the Spirit and with power. His theme was " salvation to all." He spoke of the advent of the Messiah, of his sacrifice and death, of his boundless  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7355-00000084"/> 164        INTO THE LIGHT. love for the children of men; he pictured the scene of the crucifixion upon Calvary, the crown of thorns, the scoffing, un- believing Jews, and the cross that then and there first became the symbol of redeeming love. He then spoke of the sweet- ness and nearness of a personal Saviour, to whom those who love him can communicate every sorrow and every aspira- tion, talking freely as friend with friend. So vivid was the description that his hearers sat almost spell-bound, gazing upon his rapt expression and listening to his glowing words. Never had the Saviour seemed to Naomi so real, so near to her soul. She received him as her own with unspeakable tenderrness, and could truly say that she had " found Him, of whom  Moses and the prophets did write." And when the hymn was given out and the congregation rose to sing, - "In the Cross of Christ I glory," Naomi's voice rose a clear soprano, full and ineffably sweet, with a heart utterance that went to the heart of the preacher, and caused his soul to expand with joy and thank- fulness that another immortal could sing the song of redeemn- ing love. After the benediction, Naomi's expressive eyes were raised a  moment to his face, and met an answering glance that inspired her with reverence and trust. They did not meet coming out of church, but as Mr. Car- rington's carriage was driving off, she saw him with the slight, graceful figure of his sister hanging upon his arm, and received a bow and smile as they turned away. "Well," said Mr. Carrington, ," we never had such preach- ing in L--  before as Mr. Vincent's. How fortunate we were in securing him!" "Yes," responded Mrs. Goodrich. "But I am of the im- pression that talent and spirituality such as his, will not long be permitted to remain in our quiet village. At the present day, just as soon as a minister has gained the love of his people, and commenced to gather in souls in earnest for his   INTO THE LIGHT.         165 Master, forthwith he receives a call to a wider field of use- fulness, as it is termed, and the fields that are often white already to harvest remain ungathered." "I think," said Naomi, " that Mr. Vincent would not be one that would ever leave a people among whom he was ilo- ing good; certainly not for any pecuniary inducement. I should think, from the elevated character of the sentiments he uttered to-day, that he had risen above worldly ambition, when. placed in competition with his Master's cause." She spoke with animation; and then, becoming conscious that she had eulogized too warmly, she cast down her eyes, and a slight blush overspread her features. Mrs. Goodrich began to revolve in her own mind how she would like Naomi as their minister's wife, and, coming to a satisfactory conclusion, she nodded to her brother, who seemed to know her thoughts; with approbation. The little girls were full of the services, and kept up a constant chatter, which covered Naomi's temporary embar- rassment. She was soon, however, talking at case on other subjects, and they reached home more than ever charmed with their guest. The following day Naomi passed with a quiet, expectant joy pervading the whole color of her thoughts.  She hoped that Horace would fulfil his promise of explaining why he wished to see her; but evening passed, and he came not. "Have I been too undisguised, too frank, in the expression of my feelings?" she thought. " Was it pity that influenced his manner towards me?"Her cheek burned as she asked the question, and she resolved to be more guarded, more re- served, when they met again. The next morning brought a number of callers, all of whom were praising the new minister. "What a pity it is that he is not married!" said one. "That time will not be far distant," replied Polly Perkins, the village gossip; "for he goes quite often to Col. Safford's,  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7355-00000085"/> 166        INTO THE LIGHT. and yesterday I met him on his way there. People do say that Lucindy, the eldest daughter, is the favorite." "What, the one they call the dark beauty?" said her companion. "Oh, no! she has Pvhat Harry Howard calls golden-brown hair, and blue eyes. She always dresses in blue, because she knows it is so becoming. Sunday, at church, I thought I saw the minister look over to their pew more than once." l"For my part," said her companion, "I do not believe he thought of anything but the great theme of his discourse. I am sure, I was never so impressed with a sermon in my life. I think such a man as he is will make his own choice of a wife without our help; don't you, Miss Perkins?" "Well, perhaps so," she answered, gathering up her shawl as she spoke, and tapping her foot nervously. "It aint best to make up one's mind too quick. None of them Safford girls would make a suitable wife, in my opinion, for a minis- ter," continued Miss Polly, who had an eye in that direction herself. "If there is anything in the world I like, it is con- sistency, and that eldest girl who joined the church lately don't carry out her profession, to my thinking." "Why, how is that, Miss Perkins?" cried her companion, who, although she did not talk much herself, always listened eagerly, with a quiet conscience, to all the spinster had to tell, and then thanked her stars that such a beam did not rest in her own eye. Polly glanced at her expectant face, saw the faintest ap- proach to a smile on the countenance of Mrs. Goodrich, no- ticed the downcast eyes of the young governess, and, satisfied that she had an attentive audience, she again seated herself, took off her white cotton gloves, gave a little shake of her dress, or rather plumed herself, and commenced pecking away at the dish of gossip she had brought with her. "Well, you see, Lucindy Safford never was a great favor- ite of mine; but that rainy Sunday afternoon beat all my experience. I went there in great haste to beg a piece of   INTO THE LIGHT.         167 old linen for Josiah Waters's eldest boy, who had cut his leg with a scythe playing in the barn. I thought I would not -make a noise with the knocker, being it was Sunday, and so I went round through the shed, and there in the back kitchen sat Lucindy, close up to the fire, with the Bible open on her lap, reading, and at the same time stirring a skillet of mo- lasses candy; and, what was worse than all the rest, little Henry and Kate sat on a cricket near, as quiet as kittens, shelling peanuts to put in it when it was done. She never made the least excuse for what she was doing, although she must have seen how shocked I was, for after she brought me the linen I wanted, she said, ' I am sorry I cannot offer you any of my candy yet, Miss Perkins, as it. is not quite done; but Harry shall bring you over some, if it stops raining.' I thanked her, with an indignant look, and resolved that I would not touch a single morsel if he did--until Monday morning." "It strikes me," said Mrs. Goodrich, with ill-concealed amusement, " that if you had eaten it at all, you would find yourself somewhat in the position of the receiver of stolen goods, who is counted' as a sort of partner with the one who commits the theft. I am afraid that you lost a chance then, Miss Perkins, to inculcate a lesson of self-denial by your own example. We must learn," she continued, "to over- look the inconsistencies of those around us, especially of church-members; some tares will grow with the wheat, and she who wears costly and extravagant garments, and yet is a punctual and apparently devout attendant upon the various religious meetings, frequently looks down upon her whose household duties keep her often absent, but whose conscience prompts her to dress in the plainest style, lest she cause any to offend." "Very well," continued Polly, tapping her fingers with emphasis upon the arm of her chair, as she rocked back and forth; " if anybody calls that consistency, I don't. To be sure, it wasn't quite a case for church discipline, yet I did  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7355-00000086"/> 168       INTO THE EIGHT. think the minister would have looked in another direction if he could have had a sight of Lucindy that stormy afternoon. Anyhow, I shall not make up my mind about him until the next sewing-circle, when I shall take notes, you may depend. Now I am going to call at Miss Munroe's, to see if\they will have it next month at their house. An(d I'll just drop in to Sally Green's, as I go by, and give them a hint to bring caake next time; there's five of 'em, and they never bring anythingl but heavy soda-bisciuit, and they do eat awfill! And the month after, you say, Mrs. Goodrich, the circle may be held here. Thank you, madam! the best one of the season is always given at this house. Good-morning!" And the two ladies took their departure, leaving Naomi with the uncomfortable consciousness that she had betrayed a preference for one whose regards were directed towards an- other object. She felt once more alone, without a friend; and then there came the comforting sense of the nearness of that divine Friend, who had " led her by a way which she knew not, and in paths she had not known." She trusted, and was comforted. The most of the day she had passed in the open air with the children, who did not seem willing to remain within doors while the weather was so summer-like. The sun was setting gloriously, and Naomi stood upon the high stone steps, looking forth over an expanse of country that might vie i beauty with Italian scenery. She saw a gentleman approaching, with a young girl leaning upon his arm. Her heart gave a quick bound; she could not mistake the noble bearing and elegant figure of the Rev. Horace Vincent.-"She obeyed her first impulse, which was to avoid him, and, run- ning down the steps, made her way into the grounds, where the foliag'e was most dense, to a rustic seat, and, taking a letter from her pocket, she tried to compose her mind by reading, in order to exclude the constant object of her thoughts. She had not long been seated when she heard voices, and Horace and his sister Laura made their appearance.   INTO THE LIGHT.         169 C, We were looking for you, Miss Hammet; we came over to call 1pon you, and suppose you did not see us as we were conming up the avenue," said Laura, cordially. "My brother was so much engaged yesterday that he could not come with 1me." Naomi replied pleasantly, but with no earnest warmth of manner. After they had been talking a few minutes, Laura suddenly turned and looked at them mischievously. ' Brother Horace," she criedl, " what are you dreaming about?" as she noticed his perplexed and puzzled expression, for the Naomi he now met was cool and indifferent, and he scarcely recognized her, so much did he miss that subtile, keen attraction of manner, which was her greatest charm. Laura inquired for the twins, said t" she wlnted to see them so much," and asked if they could be found in the house. "I will take care of Miss Hammet, Laura, if you wish to go," said Horace, with a slightly marked emphasis. Laura's quick perceptions received the idea at once; but just as she was turning to go, Naomi spoke. "Miss Vincent, one moment, if you please; release my sleeve from this thorn-bush." Laura sprang to do her bidding, and the slight delay thus caused, gave Naomi an opportunity to lead the way towards the house, much to Horace's disappointment; and on their arrival, the joyous welcome of Laura by the twins left no room for any other demonstration. Naomi, who possessed in her character the repose and pol- ish of the true lady, did not allow herself more than a mo- mentary expression of coolness towards one who, was himself not to blame, if a deeper interest than she knew ha-d gathered in her heart, and had perhaps unconsciously found expression. If indifference, if nothing but gentle- manly courtesy had influenced his frank, cordial, and some- whaTt tender dlemeanor towards her, then he would not quickly * apprehend the existence of any deeper interest, and she was secure in her maiden modesty. 15  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7355-00000087"/> 170        INTO THE LIGHT. To bestow love unsought, even upon one so noble and true, wounded her pride, and fettered her independence of thought and will; she would rise superior to all this and be herself again. She had been looking from the window as these thoughts were passing through her mind, while Horace had been talking to Zella, who had seated herself on a has- sock at his feet, and was showing him a book of rare and beautiful pictures. Some Italian scenery excited her admi- ration, and she wanted her teacher to share it. "' Miss Hammet, please come here and listen to Mr. Vin- cent; he takes me away from here to the sunny land he is talking about. Sit down here beside him ; " and she pointed to the lounge which would only hold two persons. Without hesitation Naomi took the offered seat, all embar- rassment having left her, while Horace felt that it was polite- ness alone which prompted her easy manner. Far rather would he have seen the flitting blush and downcast eye of girlish timidity, attesting his influence and power. Hier gentle dignity made him doubt if ever she had bestowed a moment's thought upon himself; and a pang of disappoint- ment cast a shadow over his expressive face. He knew not until that moment how unutterably dear she was to his soul; he wondered how he had allowed himself to believe that she would feel an interest in his future sufficient to listen to what he had intended to tell her that very evening, when he left his home with a heart so full of hope and love. Laura soon came towards them, followed by Gabrielle and Julia, who were talking eagerly of some anticipated pleasure. Naomi, whose spirits had been depressed during the day, seemed to buoy and sustain their merry prattle by her lively sallies of wit. A servant entered bearing a waiter of fruit and cake, with glasses of lemonade, followed by Mr. Car- rington, who said that he had heard the music of young voices, and by a strong attraction was drawn among them. "' Mr. Vincent," he continued, "Col. Safford is about to have a festal gathering of our town people in honor of the   INTO THE LIGHT.         171 return of his only son who has been absent in Europe several years. It will be quite a grand affair ; they have been over a week in preparation, and it comes off to-morrow, he tells me. Have you been apprised of it?" "Oh, yes," replied Horace: "I came over with my sister to speak to 5Miss Hammet and the young people about it. It will be quite a unique affair. The colonel's grounds are beautifully decorated, and I believe no pains or expense has been spared to make the whole affalr worthy the occasion. Stanley Safford is a noble fellow, and his father may well be proud of such a son, and rejoice at his return. Miss Ham- met," he continued, " may I ask if you will go with your interesting charge? The colonel sends an invitation and would be greatly disappointed if you did not come." Naomi did not reply at once, but glanced towards the twins, whose eager, expectant faces brought a smile to her lips. "How shall it be, girls, - shall we go?" "Why, Miss Hammet," said Gabrielle, " only think how delightful it will be to have a collation beneath the trees, and music and dancing on the lawn! It will seem like fairy land. The grounds are perfectly splendid. There are beautiful groves and romantic walks, and away down in a shady dell is a lake, on which is a boat, where we can have a sail. Julia took us there to walk one day. You will let uis go, will you' not?" "I think so," said Naomi, gently, "' if you so much desire it." "In that case," said Horace, " allow me to take the twins and their teacher under my especial care." This arrangement did not quite suit Naomi, as she felt that it would require an effort to preserve the right distance between them in the free and social relation of a festive oc- casion like the one in prospect, where the most formal un- bend naturally from life's dignities and cares, and yield to the charm of sunshine and flowers, and the exhilarating in- fluence of the open air. She assented, however, and was  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7355-00000088"/> 172        INTO THE LIGHT. not insensible to the grateful glance which Horace gave her as he rose to talie his leave. He had hoped much from this interview, and had been disappointed, chilled, and discour- aged, he scarcely knew why. "I am very glad you are, going, Miss Hammet," said Laura, "as my sister Grace cannot go; grandfather is not quite as well as usual." "Glad!" cried Gazelle; ," of course we are; she is the dearest teacher in the world;" and she sprung from the low hassock where she had been seated, and threw her arms around her neck, kissing her fondly. Naomi laughed at her earnestness, without being at all aware that Horace paused a moment, as he turned from her, to listen to the voice which charmed him like the fresh, sweet carol of a bird. Totally unconscious was she of the rare gift she possessed in her melodious laugh, although she herself was peculiarly sensitive to impressions from the human voice, and had felt powerfully attracted towards Horace Vin- cent only after she had heard the mellow richness, the deep music tones of the few sentences he uttered the first time they met. All finely constituted organizations, all sensitive natures are played upon  by the human voice, and much that de- presses or exhilarates, we know not why, is due to the transmission of sound, which in so subtle a manner con- veys an influence directly to the interior nature, which re- sponds by imparting to the countenance a flitting shadow or a joyous smile. How quickly the innocent infant attests its power by the quivering lip which grieves at harsh sounds, or the baby cooing and laughing which springs forth at the mother's carol or lullaby! It was more by voice than manner that Horace knew that a  change had taken place in Naomi; and when the twins and Julia offered to walk a little way home with them, he was not surprised that she declined. They were to meet to-mor- row, however; and with that thought he grew hopeful and buoyant again, and listened to the playful chatter of the   "Tro THE LIGHT.         173 young girls by his side, occasionally increasing their mirth by a lively sally of his own. At the corner of Locust Street they parted with bright anticipations on their part of the coming day of pleasure on the morrow. Laura Vincent's interview Tvith those charming children had restored for the time her former vivacity, and she seemel herself once more as they walked homeward. Bancroft's visits at the house were usually followed by a season of depression, of fitful humor, that seemed in a fair way to injure her naturally sweet disposition. She seemed no longer the innocent, confiding child; but a wilful, capri- cious girl, whose wayward fancies led her to be grave and gay in a breath; to earnestly desire some change, and when it came, to thrust it from her with an unsatisfied yearning at her heart, and a shadow upon her brow, that troubled and perplexed Grace with a more serious anxiety than she had ever known. She had spoken to Bancroft about it, but he treated the subject lightly, -indeed, he did not ask for her as had been his wont when she was absent, but rather seemed to avoid her. Grace was not quite happy; there was a some- thing, impossible to describe, in Percy's manner towards her, that was unsatifyiug.  She missed the tenderly modulated accents that had charmed and won her love, and yet he was assiduous in his lover-like attentions, but they lacked heart and seemed a mere form; she grew abstracted and dreamy sometimes, when he was present, trying to analyze that which to her was truly a mystery. 15*  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7355-00000089"/> 174        INTO THE LIGHT. CHAPTER XXIV. Face and figure of a child, - Though too calm, you think, and tender, For the childhood you would lend her, And her voice it murmurs lowly As a silver stream may run Which yet feels, you feel, the sun. E. B. BROWNINO. THE following day was as clear and beautiful as they could desire. Mr. Carrington's family carriage had been drawn out, and the coachman was sponging the outside, beating the cushions, and putting everything in order for the trip; while the twins, every now and then, ran to the window to watch and report the progress John was making. By two in the afternoon they were all ready. Mrs. Goodrich and Mr. Car- rington were quite as much in the humor as the children, while Naomi could not help thinking how pleasant it would be to hear the voice she loved best once more. When they reached Colonel Safford's noble mansion, they found the im- mense doors at each end of the spacious hall thrown open, revealing the grassy lawn beyond, already lively with prom- enaders dressed in gala attire, forming picturesque groups beneath the shady trees. As they entered the drawing-room, the colonel advanced to meet them, accompanied by a distinguished-looking gentleman, somewhat. taller than himself, whom he intro- duced as his son. -  " Welcome home, at last, Mr. Safford! " cried MPr. Carring- ton; I Home again from a   foreign shore!'" l Dear me," whispered Julia to Lucinda, one of the colonel's daughters, , there is father at his quotations again. I  hope your brother is not satirical, is he?"   INTO THE LIGHT.         175 "Why?" questioned the young lady whom she addressed. "Because his mouth has - I think - such a cynical ex- pression." "Oh," replied the sister; " that look you speak of, he always had; it does not mean that he is not pleased; he seldom smiles, but he is just as good as he can be for all that. Thisfete is all a surprise of father's, and was projected hastily as soon as we were sure of the day the steamer would arrive. We are English people, you know, and such festive gratherings are quite common among our kindred in the old country. Come and speak to Stanley, and then we will go out in the grounds where you see that arch decorated with flowers." Stanley Safford had just been speaking to Naomi, as they approached, and Julia saw one of those rare and beautiful smiles, that his sister spoke of, just then lighting up his face, called forth by the charm of voice and manner of his inter- esting companion. Stanley Safford spoke a moment pleas- antly t tthe young girl whom his sister introduced, and then his eyes wandered to the fair trio who had just before been presented to him. The twins had walked away as Lucinda came near, and were standing looking at a beautiful painting with Naomi, who was pointing out its beauties, with a desire to educate their taste for art in all its forms. Stanley Safford took Mr. Carrington by the arm, and in a low voice said, " I have not seen in Europe one face whose beauty can at all compare with that of yonder fair girl." Here was a chance for a quotation, and Mr. Carrington replied, "' Yes, my dear sir, ' she walks in beauty like the light of cloudless climes and starry skies. " With a slight curl of the lip, Stanley replied, "Very true! but there is an intellectual expression superior to mere beauty, that pleases me most. How few of the women of the present day can be called thinkers, and when they are so, how plainly is it written on every lineament!" "You have not lost your heart it seems in foreign climes,"  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7355-00000090"/> repliedl his companion. "That young lady's history is very interesting." Further explanation was rendered impossible by the arrival of more company, and Mr. Safford did not hear the termina- tion of the sentence he was so much interested in. Naomi, yielding to the eager call of the twins, had strolled out into the grounds, whose beauty called forth little bursts of enthusiasm from Gazelle, who enjoyed everything with such intensity. '"Julia," she whispered, "don't you admire Miss Hammet's dress, that sheer white muslin, with little black sprays dotted over it? And then those jet bracelets, - how lile alabaster they make her arms look i I have always seen her in black until to-day. I cannot help looking at her. Sometimes it seems as if she was not our teacher, but some Jewess prin- cess in disguise, she is so dignified; and then again she will join in our games with so much animation that she seems a girl like one of us." "The truth is," said Julia, laughng, "I think Miss Ham- met will never have a lover who will be a more hearty ad- mirer or more devoted than you are, Gazelle. What will you do some day when one comes and takes her away?" "Do?" cried Gazelle, while her face and neck grew crimson at the unpleasant thought, "why, I will go with her of course!" "You foolish child," replied Julia, in a little matronly sort of a  way, " don't you know that you would be ' de trop,' very much in the way indeed; you must not think to have her always. Do  you know that I think our minister is in love with her?" Julia was not prepared for Gazelle's next impetuous move- ment. Throwing back her long curls with an impatient ges- ture, she sprang forward and caught Naomi's hand, just as Mr. Safford and Horace Vincent were approaching arm in arm, and dragged her almost on the run, down a side path, crying "Come! come this minute or I shall scream!" Far   down into the shadow of the tall elms they passed; until Gazelle flung herself away from the hand she held, and burst into a passion of tears. Naomi waited until the sobs grew fainter, and then, with soothing words, drew her on to tell her all her grief. 'I don't like him! I never will like him  again! HHe shall not takle you away." "Why, Zella, what is it, dear, that you mean? Come to me, for I must know." The child came back at those gentle words, and nestling close beside her, she murmured, 'Thc minister! Mr. Vin- cent, they say, will one day take you home. Will he, do you think?" And she gazed into her face with eager earnest- ness, waiting for a reply. An intense feeling of mortification surged over Naomi as these words were uttered, and she thought, "Can it be possi- ble that I have so far betrayed my preference, that even the children understand it?" She clasped both hands over her face, for a moment unwilling that even Zella should see the hot scarlet flush of shame that rushed over neck and brow. "Please forgive me!" said the child. ' Have I made you cry, too?" "' No, darling," replied Naomi, in a low tone, as she raised, her head; t" make yourself quite easy on that point. I de.- sire that you will not talk with Julia or any one else on this subject agcain.  You must try very hard my child to sub- due such violence of feeling. Come! Gabrielle will wonder what has become of us." Naomi's voice trembled as, rising, she crushed back within her heart all the sweet hopes and dreams that had been bud- ding into a beauty and light, that had brightened her lonely life, flickered in and out among its shadows, bringing with it a secret joy, that she had not acknowledged to herself, like a hidden spring making its way beneath the soil unseen. Yet, all along its track, the fresh green grass and blooming wild flowers attested its life-giving presence and power.  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7355-00000091"/> 178       INTO THE LIGHT. She would have given worlds, just then, to have been in her little room alone, where she might think off the incubus that had been laid so heavily upon her; but society is milghty in its demands, and it was best for her to meet her new trial face to face. A short distance to the right of the path they were in they heard the sound of merry voices, and, w ending their ways in that direction, they saw a miniature lake or pond, upon whose placid bosom three or four white swans were sailing slowly towards a group of young girls and three or four gentlemen who were standing upon the bank. Gabriclle lcft Horace Vincent's side, as they drew near, and bounded towards them with childish curiosity. l' Where have you been, Zella?" she inquired ; "Mr. Vin- cent and I have been looking for you, and you have been crying, too. Is anything the matter, sister?" "Nothing now, only I have been silly; but Miss Hammet forgives me, Mr. Vincent," said Gazelle, bravely, as he ap- proached; and the child took his hand, and looked up into his face confidingly, and then at Naomi, showing that all un- kind feeling had vanished firom her mind. Horace looked down upon the speaking face, and felt its charm, but guessed not that his peace was involved in the little side scene that had just been enacted. "Miss Hammet," he remarked, "I fear that you will think me a poor cicerone, for I certainly as yet have not had the pleasure of showing you any of the charms of this beautiful place." "Pray consider yourself quite free, Mr. Vincent, from any care which you may have felt that you have assumed; for, believe me, it is irksome to feel that any one should take such a trouble needlessly." Horace looked pained for the moment at her remark, and then in low but feeling tones he murmured, ("Can Miss Ham- met so far have mistaken me as not to know that it would be my greatest joy?"   INTO THE LIGHT.        179 To Naomi's reliefjust then, Laura drew near them, saying, - ("Oh, how I wish I had some crumbs of cake, and then Miss Hammet, you might have the pleasure of feeding those swans." "Your wish shall be gratified in a moment," said Stanley Safford, lifting his hat to the bright, laughing girl, and to her surprise he was out of sight in an instant. Percy Bancroft had witnessed this little manoluvre with a gloomy frown upon his brow, and, taking out a volume of poems from his pocket, he threw hilmself out half length beneath a shady tree, ostensibly to read, but really to watch the movements of the capricious girl who filled his thoughts. A few moments afterwards, 5Mr. Safford made his appear- ance with an exquisite little basket, of Indian workmanship, filled with cake, which he placed in Laura's hand, telling her to keep it for the same,purpose in future. She thanked him, but hardly knew what to say in reply; and to cover her em- barrassment she cried, "Girls! I will give you each a piece, and then we will see which of us those stately dames will favor first. I think I can charm them all away ;" and, kneel- ing down on the grassy bank, she chirruped and called in low, sweet tones, while the others did the same a short dis- tance from her. Soon the snowy sails of the largest swan were seen bearing down slowly and beautifully, directly to- wards her. Laura raised the other hand, with an imperious gesture, and uttered a little cry of delight, as the bright eyes looked fearlessly into hers, and the gracefully arched neck and head bent before her to take the dainty food. Immedi- ately in her wake came the two others; while the girls on the bank, and the gentlemen also, joined in their efforts to decoy them aside, feeling interested in the contest. But no coaxing could draw them away, until their leader, with a stately obeisance and click of the rosy bill, attested his thanks, and sailed off majestically, followed by his satellites, to the great amusement of the little group who had wit- nessed the scene. Laura clapped her hands, and cried, "Victory!" while Mr.  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7355-00000092"/> 180       INTO THE LIGHT. Safford declared that he was quite sure Miss Vincent could cast a charm over anything, and begged her not to be too arbitrary in the exercise of her power. He lingered a mo- ment to hear her saucy rejoinder, - for Laura was in high spirits that day, -but it was only the struggle of the cap- tive bird striving to be free once more; for she felt vexed with herself that beneath all her merriment there arose the wish that Percy would put down his book and come to her. "Why could he not have looked when those beautiful creatures formed so charming a picture upon the dark-blue waters of the little lake?" She dreamed not that his keen eye, eager for beauty, had gazed with delight more upon the fairy figure in its flowing robes of soft white muslin, whose every attitude was full of grace, than upon any other animated object. She was restless and dissatisfied with his apparent neglect and,indifference. Yet why should she care? He be- longed to Grace,--he was nothing to her. "It was only be- cause he was in view that she thought so frequently of him." Versatile and erratic in her movements, Laura Vincent sprang forward, and encircled with her arms Julia's waist, and led her off far away from the listless figure beneath the tree, just in time to meet Austin Somers,-- arry Win- throp's most intimate friend, - who engaged her for the next cotillon. In the mean time Horace Vincent had roused himself from the fascinating spell which lay upon him, and had for a little while bestowed his attentions, as in duty bound, among his parishioners. More than one fair girl had beamed upon him gracious smiles; but the unwelcome thought continually ob- truded that he might thus seem to take Naomi at her word, and indirectly show that he really felt that it was a care he had taken upon him. He resolved to speak to her again, but as he emerged from the laurel path he found her engaged in an animated conversation with Stanley Safford, and felt in no wise satisfied when he beheld the evident pleasure they seemed to take in each other's remarks.   'INTO THE LIGHT.        181 Safford had been giving her some idea of social life in Germany, and said that the present fete reminded him of some he had witnessed in that far-away land. Having great powers of imitation, he amused her by personating some of the characters he described, only to evoke a smile to her lips, and enjoy its beauty. Horace Vincent, who had also visited Germany, was amused at the vivid and truthful portraitures, and slightly envious; it must be confessed, that any but himself should give her. pleasure. Ministers are but mortal menl, and a slight jeal- ousy tinged his thoughts as Safford gave Naomi his arm, and they took their way towards the dancers upon the lawn. A band of music was playing, and the scene was peculiarly exhilarating. Many a glance was directed towards Stanley Safford, as he led the fair Jewess to a rustic seat and stood beside her, an amused spectator of the merry grouLps. Mrs. Park, whose daughter Eva aspired to be the belle of L-- , grew quite indignant, and wondered if it was foreign -manners to be so attentive to one guest, and neglect all the rest. What beauty he could see in that girl she could not imagine. "She does not dance, either; has probably no ed- ucation. I shall not feel willing to have Eva introduced." "I suppose it will be useless to ask you to dance, Miss Hammet," he continued, " as I see you yet wear mourning, and I shall reluctantly leave your side to take my part. Pity me, will you not, and consider me the victim of politeness?" and he bent his expressive eyes upon her with a smile, whose beauty Naomi could not help but appreciate, although she shrunk from the admiration it expressed. A moment after, Stanley Safford bowed before the fair Eva, and requested her hand for the dance. The mother cast a glance of triumph towards the seat where Nlaomi sat; but it was lost upon the object of her thoughts, who sat watching with delight the graceful figures of Laura and her partner in the mazurka, while Gabrielle and Gazelle, a little apart, were waltzing to the same music. 16  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7355-00000093"/> 182     - ^  INTO THE LIGHT. A short distance from her stood Percy Bancroft. -He held in his hand an ebony cane, with which he violently switched off the blossoms from the top of an alder-bush, giving such sharp, vicious cuts, that he was evidently personifying the bush, and in that way giving vent to the chagrin and impa- tience which pervaded his mind, when he beheld the surpass- ing beauty of the youthful pair, who seemed so fitted for each bther that the contrast with himself was painful, and he felt -that he was quite too old to ever be aught to Laura but an elder-brother. He could not help but acknowledge how much more fitting a choice she might make, and he knew not that any especial interest for him had gathered in her mind. Mr. Carrington, who approached, and noticed the direction of his eyes, thought it a fine chance for a quotation. !"That sweet girl," he cried, " has doubtless learned ' music and motion of an angel,' as Jeremy Taylor says. Oh, would I were a boy again!" A few moments after Laura came towards them, and Percy breathed free again. "Why, Mr. Bancroft," she exclaimed, " you have not been dancing! Are you not well?" "Oh, yes, Miss Laura; quite well, only somewhat disturbed mentally. The truth is, I do not like to see a young lady show so marked a preference, such evident pleasure in any gentleman's society as you have manifested this afternoon, while dancing. Let me tell you, child, that a little more re- serve of manner is more feminine, more -" The cool, practised man of the world was not prepared tot behold the amused smile which met his gaze as he spoke. He had expected a deprecatory look, a timid blush, or, per- haps, a slightly vexed manner; but no! the child, as he tried to think her at that moment, had the mastery. Whether she possessed the faculty of thought-reading or not, he did not know; but Bancroft's motives stood as plainly revealed as if he had uttered them, and roused all the coquetry of her nature. She forgot, for the time, her sister Grace. He saw   INTO THE LIGHT.         183 she was not put down, or deceived by his assumption of dig- nity, and he admired her all the more for the little saucy toss of the head that revealed the untamed nature of the wilful girl. "Why, Mr. Bancroft, we danced well, did we not? Very much better, I am quite sure, than any one in the set, be- cause Mr. Somers is the easiest, as well as the most finished dancer I ever saw. I believe Lucinda Safford envied me." "And so you enjoyed dancing from such an unworthy motive, did you?" said Percy, curiously. "By no means; only it is quite as pleasant to have a part- ner who dances well, as it is in playing a duet to have one who thoroughly understands every note of the music. Look, sir!" she continued; " you have another opportunity of ex- ercising your keen powers of criticism, for Mr. Somers is dancing with another young lady, who looks as happy, per- haps, as did my humble self." "They are waltzing, however," said Percy, dryly; " per- haps you would prefer that interesting dance." "Oh, no!" replied, Laura; " 1I never could be persuaded to waltz; besides, my brother does not approve of it. I think it very beautiful where two little girls, who have practised sufficiently to dance well, waltz together; for instance, like Gabrielle and Gazelle; but I do not like to see a lady and gentleman waltz. By the way, Mr. Bancroft, the first time I ever saw you, you danced all the evening at Mr. Carrington's Christmas party. Have you given up such vanities?" "Not quite; there are some vanities yet, over which I try to exercise a slight supervision." "Which respond to what name?" inquired Laura, laugh- ingly. "My own, perhaps?" "Even so, bewitching child," said Percy, warmly, while he took her hand and placed it within his arm, saying, ' Shall we walk, Laura?- shall we mingle with the prome- naders?-- or will you dance once more?" "What, after such a lecture on propriety, do you ever  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7355-00000094"/> 184       INTO THE LIGHT. expect me to dance again, Mr. Bancroft? No, I prefer walking." They had gone but a few steps, when Laura became aware that her hand was yet within his clasp, although held lightly, and apparently unconsciously. "Get my sunshade, please; I have left it on the seat," she said, abruptly. Percy relinquished the little hand, which he felt almost sure lingered in his clasp, with a feeling that life could have no greater charm than to have constantly by his side this fascinating girl. He came back looking so changed, so bright and genial, so different from the gloomy-looking man who had first accosted her, that she was not insensible to the change, and began to 'have a faint idea that she was associated in some way with his varying moods. She could not help thinking, as le ap- proached her, how manly, how noble he looked; how very far superior to any of the young men of L---; and she thought how proud she would be to have him for a brother. But why did that thought bring a pang? She would not, she did not wish to inquire. They strolled for some distance down a pleasant shaded path without speaking, each fully content with the simple fact that they were near each other. Presently Percy said there was a question he wished her to answer. "How do you like Mr. Safford, Laura?" "Like him! Oh, very much! Do you know that he gave me this little red, white, and blue basket, which I have on my arm? It will be a pretty memento of this brilliant fete. By the way, Mr. Bancroft, what book was that which so much interested you this afternoon?" Laura betrayed, by these questions, that she had noticed his indifference, and Percy, with inward delight, caught the unconscious meaning of the innocent girl. It was of some consequence, then, to her, what he did. It was just possible that he had awakened an interest in her heart. He replied   INTO THE LIGHT.         185 by leading her to a seat, and, taking the book from his pocket, he commenced reading aloud from a volume of poems. He had never dared, when she had been a bright, eager, atten- tive listener to his readings before, to infuse so much feeling and expression into the sentiment. Now, the whole power of his strong magnetic nature was thrown into the verse, which acted upon the sensitive organization of his compan- ion, who drank of love deeply from the glowing words of the poet, forgetting, in the charm of the moment, her sister Grace, and Percy's plighted vows. Did no thought of the fair girl, who was at that moment devoting herself to the care of her aged relative, cross his mind? Did no twinge of conscience upbraid him for his in- constancy? He had not said one word which she would not approve. He had only been reading aloud. He had read aloud many times before; he thought there was no harm, surely, in that. As yet, there was no settled purpose in his mind, but the exquisite delight he took in her society. Laura came back first from the region of sentiment and poetry where they had been wandering, and, springing to her feet, she declared she had rested long enough, and would like to return and witness the dancing once more. Bancroft reluctantly consented, and when they came in sight of the lawn they found temporary awnings had been erected as if by magic. Tables were already laid, decorated with flowers, fruits, creams, and the more substantial viands which consti- tute a collation. Laura no sooner made her appearance than Austin Somers -who had been looking for her all the time he had been talking with one of the colonel's daughters- came forward, and, bending before her, whispered a few words in her ear; and, without a look towards Percy, she walked quickly away with him, much to the chagrin of her former companion, who bit his lip with vexation, muttering, "Ca- pricious and changeable as a will-o'-the-wisp, and about as easily caught and appropriated." "Mrs. Goodrich," said he, offering his arm to that lady, 16* !  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7355-00000095"/> 186        INTO THE LIGIIT, who stood near," allow me to be your knight and escort you to where you may taste of the rich and bountiful feast pre- pared by the colonel." Percy Bancroft had always been a favorite with that lady, and she felt pleased and flattered that he should have select- ed her in preference to either of the younger and more attrac- tive ladies. He had a motive for this, and plied her with questions respecting Harry Winthrop's family and prospects, all the time making a calculation as to the chances he might have if he aspired to win -the heart of Laura Vincent. In the mean time Austin Somers had led Laura to where a group of young girls were playing Graces. Lucinda Safford hailed her with girlish enthusiasm. "Miss Vincent, I am so glad you have come.' When at school, you excelled in playing this game. Please take the sticks, and show us and Mr. Somers how to play." Laura was rather glad to be called away from the society of Percy Bancroft, feeling not altogether easy in regard to her sister Grace and. the emotions that had pervaded her mind. She therefore entered into the game with great glee, while Bancroft, at a distance, watched the merry group and thought to himself, "She is but a child, after all, and plays with all the delight of a little girl." Austin Somers managed to keep beside her when they were called to partake of refreshments, and she entertained him with school anecdotes, which elicited his hearty laughter. She knew that Bancroft was watching her keenly, and if she flirted for the moment with Mr. Somers, she thought it was only to prove how free she was, and how wholly indifferent to his praise or censure. She was in great danger of forgetting the teachings of her sister Grace, until her eye caught the surprised look of Horace, and she became herself again, and with that rare naturalness and simplicity of manner, which so much endeared her to all, confessed her fault at once. "I have been talking very foolishy, Mr. Somers, - more     INTO THE LIGHT.         187 for effect, perhaps, than to entertain you; and I confess it now as a penance for my nonsense. Pray excuse me." "Excuse you'!" he exclaimed, with earnestness. "Would that I miglit often have an opportunity to excuse such pleas- ant moments! Miss Vincent, why are you so unlike most other young ladies in your frankness? I believe it is because you love the truth so dearly." "I am not always so truthful as you think, Mr. Somers, for I have acted a lie, sometimes, when I did not speak one. I wonder what would be the state of society if truth, without any disguise, prevailed? If I should say to some lady, who invited me to visit her, ' I thank you for your invitation, but I do not like youl well enough to come,' instead of ' I -shall be very happy to!'? --or, if called from my music- lesson or studies to receive visitors, and they should say, I I hope I have not interrupted you; I hope we are not en- croachinga upon your time;' -instead of replying, ' Oh, no! not in the least; I am very glad to see you,' - which amounts to just nothing, generally,--I should say, 'Well! yes; it is an interruption, and you are about to take from me time which could be better employed'? Mrs. Park, for instance: I think I see her brown satin dress and cashmere shawl sweeping out of the room after such a reply, and the lady's indignation sufficiently strong to make her my enemy ever after." 'That is very true," replied her companion. "How I wish society could be regenerated in that respect; especially as regards the false coin of compliments! One feels often as if he were walking upon quicksands, which yield an insecure and treacherous footing, when such vapid flatteries are circu- lating. But here and there, at rare intervals, we find some who are true to themselves and others." Laura changed the conversation just then by asking her brother, who stood near, when he had seen Miss Hammet. "A short time since," he replied, briefly; for he had been striving in vain to get an opportunity to speak a few words  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7355-00000096"/> 188       INTO THE LIGHT. *   - with her alone, but was prevented by Gazelle, who seemed, he thought, purposely to put herself in the way. This unu- sual vigilance on the child's part arose from a remark that Naomi had purposely made to her, - that she might be her attendant and gallant the rest of the afternoon. Mr. Carrington soon came up, all bustle and excitement. He had been waiting for John to come and extricate the car- riage, which was crowded among a number of others; but John was having his own amusement among the servants, quite regardless that the sun was below the horizon, and the visitors were leaving. Mr. Carrington proceeded to find Mrs. Goodrich, and catching a glimpse of his guest, he disposed of her sum- marily. "Mr. Vincent," he cried, " come and attend to Miss Ham- met." Horace gave Naomi his arm, which she took with a beating heart and a strange feeling of timidity which made her blush and tremble, for she had felt the influence of his presence so powerfully all the afternoon, owing to his concentration of thought upon her alone, - but which she supposed was her own unfortunate attachment, - that her usual ease and self- possession seemed to have deserted her, and she could do nothing else but accept the arm of her companion. Laura and the twins had gone to fill her little basket with flowers before returning home. The moment they mingled with the promenaders Horace, with deep feeling, frankly alluded to his past regrets. "I wonder, Miss Hammet, if you have the slightest con- ception of my disappointment when I saw you last; when I hoped to spend an hour in your society alone, for the reason that I thought you might feel an interest in my varied fortunes since I saw you in New York, and would rejoice in my suc- cess. Now I woclder that I should have felt so, for I fear that hope was too presuming ;" and his voice trembled as he spoke. Naomi's eyes were cast down when he commenced speak-   INTO THE LIGHTS         189 ing, but before he had finished, she gathered courage from his agitation, and looked in his face with a gentle seriousness. "You mistake me, Mr. Vincent," she said. "Your for- tunes will always possess an interest for me. I should cer- tainly consider myself wanting iii all the qualities of a true friendship, if I allowed absence or change of scene to affect a sentiment which I have once received and cherished." "Your words, Miss Hammet, ought to satisfy any reason- able man, and I am, I trust, grateful, most grateful; but yet it takes more than that to satisfy the heart. 'You do not know, or even dream, how high were my aspirings,--how keen is the pang of disappointment which your remark has called forth. This seems inconsistent, does it not?" "Somewhat so, I confess," said Naomi, in a low voice. "And yet," he continued, " the word friend has a sweet sound to the weary ones of earth,-' The name of friend, or whatever by that holy name the angels comhprehend. " "You should practise what you preach, Mr. Vincent. Last Sunday you gave me some thoughts of life - which are not irrelevant to our present subject - that were most valua- ble to me, and which I shall not soon forget." "Was it so?" he exclaimed, while his fine countenance beamed with a pure and tender joy. "Then I was not mis- taken in that look of approval which I saw upon your face, and afterward supposed it to be only imagination. I had thought - I had hoped - " Again the idea presented itself to Naomi that she had been too undisguised in the expression of her feelings, and she coldly turned from him , with an indifferent remark. "John has atoned for his former negligence I see, for he has the children already in the carriage, and they are, I think, waiting for me." "Pardon me, I beg of you, Miss Hammet! I see that I have detained you too long, and, indeed, too selfishy, for I have all this time been talking of myself, when I ought to *   &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7355-00000097"/> 190        INTO THE LIG(HT. have known how weary you were. When do you return to New York?" "In a few days, I believe," replied Naomi. "I shall hope to have the pleasure of calling upon you, some time, Miss Hammet. Rest assured that you shall not again find me so prosy, so egotistical." "You mistake me altogether, Mr. Vincent," said Naomi, in some confusion, as he assisted her into the carriage. He held her hand one moment, lightly, with an inquiring look. "I do not think I quite understand your last remark. Does it mean that you accord me your forgiveness?" he asked.- "Believe me," she replied, gently, "I have nothing to for- give. I ought, rather, to thank you for your care over these little girls here, and politeness to their teacher." "Yes, Mr. Vincent," interrupted Gabrielle, " we have had a real nice time, and you must be sure and come to New York very soon, and see us." When Horace shook hands with them, at parting, Naomi felt that possibly they would not meet again during her visit, and although her heart grew sad at the thought, yet she smiled a farewell with that frank good-humor which always seemed like a diffusion of sunshine wherever she went. Horace sought his sister, and found her the other side of the lawn with Percy Bancroft. She seemed to be listening to her companion, with downcast eyes and blushing cheeks, who started and looked confused as Horace drew near; but recovered his assurance almost instantly. "Ah, Vincent!" he said, " you see we were waiting for you, and I am now ready to yield my companion into your care, and take my horseback ride to the city. Tell Grace, if you please, that I shall not be able to see her to-night, as I must meet a gentleman at the ' Astor,' on business, at nine o'clock this evening." Horace felt a depressing influence surround him, and a vague anxiety, mingled with surprise, at Bancroft's manner. But still there was nothing definite which he could question,   INTO THE LIGHT.         191 and his faith in his college friend was only slightly shaken as they shook hands heartily at parting. He detected some- thing assumed, something not quite natural, about his sister. He felt uneasy lest he had done wrong in letting her go into society too soon, and he resolved to be more careful of his pet lamb, his home treasure. CHAPTER XXV. I cannot sleep; my fervid brain Calls up the vanished past again, And throws its misty splendors deep Into the pallid realms of sleep. "ONGFELLOW. THE sun declined and stillness settled down over the lawn, late so full of life and merriment, and the little town of L-- was soon apparently wrapped in peaceful slumbers. There was more than one restless heart that kept a sor- rowful vigil far into the midnight hour, and many were the fruitless plans and hopes that had birth and died before the, morning light. There was something impossible to describe in Naomi's manner, during their last interview, which puzzled Horace Vincent, and gave him a gleam of encouragement and hope. He reviewed all the past, and resolved to see her once more before she left for New York. The hours flew swiftly and dreamily by, and still the Rev. Horace Vincent came not, and our heroine felt more and more assured that she had bidden a last farewell to one who had wholly forgotten, or else viewed her with indifference. She became listless and sad, and rather wished to return to her school duties. She felt that what she most needed was occupation, and experienced a sensation of relief when a let-  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7355-00000098"/> 192       LNTO THE LIGHT. ter came from Mrs. Armstrong calling them home the next Thursday. One evening Naomi had lingered in her room longer than had been her wont, when Gabrielle came in with an arch look, saying, "Miss Hammet, you are wanted down- stairs."' "For what, my dear?" " "Why, a gentleman has called to see you." "Did he ask especially for me? Who is he?" "I have his card," replied Gabrielle, " but I shall not let you have it. You must guess. He is elegant." And she shook her curls saucily, made a dancing courtesy, and retreated as Naomi came towards her, saying, "Come downstairs and see." There was but one person in Naomi's thoughts. Her heart throbbed wildly at the formal call. What did it mean? She had hoped he would come and had been disappointed so many times, that she began to make excuses to herself that she was not in a hurry to go down, but was very calm, not the least impatient. Strange to say, she never looked once in the glass to adjust more becomingly her hair, but took a fresh rosebud from her belt, that Julia had given her, anid placed it in a glass which stood near, not willing to recall to her own mind some thoughts while in his presence connected with another fragrant rose, which had been carefully pre- served among her heart-treasures ever since it was bestowed by the Rev. Horace Vincent. She threw a shawl lightly over her shoulders, and went down to meet, not the one she hoped to see, but Stanley Safford advanced to greet her, and with much warmth of manner expressed his pleasure at seeing her again. He had evidently not forgotten the interesting con- versation which they had held in the grounds at the time of the afternoon fete, and he had called, as soon as politeness would allow, to cultivate still further the acquaintance of the fascinating girl who had charmed him all the more from the fact that she had made no effort to attract his attention, and he had been accustomed to have a whole battery of charms   INTO THE LIGHT.         193 levelled at him by the feminine world, quite sufficient to increase his good opinion of himself and lead him to be fas- tidious to a fault. The perfect poise and self-possession of her manner con- vinced him that he had met a lady who was at least indifferent, insensible to the fact that he was handsome and wealthy, and it only piqued him to learn, still more, of one who stood upon an altitude so far above him. '"I wonder," he thought, " if she has her share of woman's vanity. That purple shawl over her shoulders is most artisti- cally arranged; perhaps she was standing at the glass all that time after I sent up my card; no doubt those pure white undersleeves have just been put on; and that little collar, which fits the slender throat to a nicety, has had the finishing touch after I came." He lifted a portion of the fringe of her shawl as he sat near her, and praised the netting, and the crochet-work. Naomi cast her eyes down upo9n it with a surprised smile, and said, "It is Julia's handiwork, Mr. Saf- ford, and it is most beautifully executed. I took it up by mistake just as I came downstairs." "That was because I teased you so, Miss Hammet, and did not mind," said Gabrielle. "I did not give her your card, Mr. Safford, and here it is in my pocket," and she knelt before Naomi and presented it, saying, "' Now to atone for being naughty, may I go and get your shawl?" Receiving an assent, the child ran off singing like a bird, and soon returned with a soft white zephyr bbordered with black, which she folded around her teacher with zealous care. Stanley confessed to himself that she looked still more lovely in her own snowy mantle, and that it was unstudied grace alone which gave so picturesque an effect to every attitude. A critical observer of ladies' dress, not a fold escaped him, not a trimming that did not receive a glance, if it was be- comingly arranged. A soiled collar had often been the means of causing him to discontinue his calls, even when the young 1J t \  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7355-00000099"/> 194        INTO THE LIGHT. lady had begun to interest him. A button off a dress, or basting-threads left in, disgusted him, and he declared that the young lady who allowed such things would make a slip- shod wife. It is a mistaken idea that most gentlelmen only notice the general effect of a lady's toilet. No one whose tastes are cultivated and refined, can refrain from being dis- turbed by any disorderly minutia, in one who has awakened a tender interest. The sense of order, fitness, harmony, yields to a feeling of restless discomfort, and fortunate is the man who heeds such a monition in time to escape a slatternly companion for life. It is true some men are heard to say that they never know when their wife dons a new dress, or what she has on ; so that she looks well generally they are suited. Such indifference is unpardonable and shows that the per- ceptive faculties havenot been cultivated, have lain dormant through sheer neglect, and a want of the appreciative ele- ment which gives so much beauty and zest to life, and makes so genial a companion. These very men would be the first to feel hurt and indig- nant if their wife did not notice a new hat or coat which they had bought, and felt was of some consequence, especially if they were told " she did not care; he looked well enough always." A pure-minded woman will always dress neatly,-- it is a necessity of her nature, --but her happiness is greatly in- creased by a lovinga word, an approving- smile. The most talented woman is not so far removed from companionship, so-far above sympathy, as to be insensible to such trifles. This want of appreciation, or the non-expression of it, in little things, has been the cause of many an estrangement, and embittered at times more than one married life. Whoever married Stanley Safford must possess not only mental charms, but her. tout ensemble must be neatness itself. No wonder, then, that he had reached the age of thirty-five without selecting a companion.   INTO TIIE LIGHT.        195 '"So," thought Stanley, " she did not even know that it was I who had honored her with a call;" and he began to feel that he was not of so much consequence after all. And when he asked her to play and sing one song, it was with a genuine feeling of diffidence to which he had long been a stranger. She complied at once, but with no coquettish airs; and he could not tell whether she cared for his opinion of her play- ing or not. She puzzled him by her naturalness and sim- plicity. Just from the sunny land of France, where its fair' ladies are as much indebted to art as nature for their fascina- tion, he did not wholly apprehend the symmetrical and beau- tiful womanhood before him. "Miss Hamlet," cried Gazelle, who had been looking in- tently at the frontispiece of a book while Naomi was playing, "i don't you think Mrs. Browning is handsomer than this pic- ture?"Naomi took the book and passed it to Stanley. "You have seen her, doubtless, Mr. Saffocrd, while in Europe," she remarked. "Oh, many times," he replied. "Those large, dark eyes have a spirituelle expression, when in conversation, which cannot be conveyed to paper. And one feels that she may at any time float away to her heavenly home, she is so fragile. Yes; she is far more lovely than is there repre- seuted." He opened the book and asked Naomi how she liked "Aurora Leigh." "I think it the most beautiful, as well'as the most finished, of all her poems," she replied. And then followed a conver- sation which became exceedingly interesting to Naomi, from his personal knowledge of many literary celebrities whom he had met in Italy and Germany. Stanley Safford seldom exerted himself to please where he felt that he had succeed- ed so indifferently. Julia decided, after he left, that he was just as charming as he could be, and Mr. Carrington ban- tered Naomi upon what he termed her new conquest. She smiled somewhat sadly, feeling that hearts were not so easily lost and gained.  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7355-00000100"/> 196        INTO THE LIGHT. CHAPTER   XXVI. Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments. Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to remove. SHAKSPEARE. "Thee do I love I and never from my heart Till life shall cease shall thy dear image part." A FEW days before NaoTmi and the twins were to return, they were out walking together, and had paused upon a rustic bridge to look at a little waterfall a short distance below, where some children were making mimic boats and committing them to the stream, shouting with delight when they went over the fall,-- calling it their Niagara. The little girls were greatly amused, and could not see why their teacher wanted them to hasten away. "C Please wait," they urged, " until that little sloop goes over, and then we will come." But it was too late to escape what she wished to avoid, and the next moment Horace Vincent - whom she had seen approaching-greeted them warmly, while Gabrielle and Gazelle did not hesitate to express their delight. "Mr. Vincent, we have not seen you since we were at Colonel Safford's," cried Gabrielle; " and Miss Hammet taught me a piece of music on purpose to play to you. And now, only think, we are going home in a few days!" "I am truly sorry to hear that you are going so soon," replied Horace. "It will give me great pleasure to hear you play.   I will call this evening,--may I not, Miss Ham- met?" "I think," said Naomi, "I heard Mr. Carrington only this   INTO THE LIGHT.     M    197 morning lamenting that he found it so difficult to secure an hour of his minister's time. Doubtless you will be quite wel- come." "4 A little too stiff and constrained to be quite easy and self-possessed," thought Horace. "How I wish I might at least tell her of the golden dream I had once cherished; of the fond hopes that have been resolutely put aside since last we mlet, and which needed but the final assurance of her ilndifference to be rooted out and cast aside forever!"Hence- forth he svould walk through life a lonely manll; no other image should ever fill his heart. He would not know the charm of domestic life, but when his duty in his present field of labor had been accomplished, he would, in far-off burning climes, devote himself to the enlightenment and saving of heathen souls. It is rather questionable whether such a consecration, brought about 'through disappointment simply, would be acceptable to the Lord! It should be free, genuine, unsel- fish, and from pure love to the Master.          ) But this self-immolation, this sacrifice of earthly hopes and joys, was not to bee required. "The Lord knoweth them that are his," and will not lay upon them burdens greater than they can bear; for human nature -so frail--often receives tender forbearance and kind providences, even when wayward and undeserving. Perfect, true, and immeasurable is the divine love, which metes out to the childlren of his care ceaseless mercies, without expecting awfull return. Quite unexpectedly an opportunity was about to be offered Horace, which proved the realization of his fondest dreams. Hope revived, - "And a sense of tune, A satisfied love meanwhile, Which nothing earthly could despoil, Sang on within his soul." A stylish-looking carriage was seen approaching down the 17*  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7355-00000101"/> 198       INTO TITE LIGHT. hill, and as it drew near they found it to contain Grace Vin- cent and Percy Bancroft. Percy had proposed a drive, and fully expected Laura would go with them, but had been dis- appointed, as of late he had not cared to be tete-a-tete"' with his betrothed, and immediately, on -seeing the twins, declared they should go also; that he would take them round by the old mill, and show them some of the finest wild strawherries they ever saw. This temptation proved too much for the children, and as Grace added her entreaties to theirs, Naomi at last consent- ed. Horace lifted them in, and, kissing their hands and nodding " good-by," they were lost to sight a moment after around the brow of the hill. A courage, born of the opportunity and emergency, was given Horace Vincent, and he resolved to speak more defi- nitely of his attachment, and abide the issue with a manly energy and firmness. "I have wanted so much to obtain an interview with you, Miss lammet, yet I have resolved and re-resolved many times that I would not crave the favor, because I saw--or thought I saw - so unmistakably that it was distasteful to you. Still, I cannot allow this moment to pass without learning, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that it is so. From the time I first saw you in the vestibule of the Jewish syna- gogue, to the present hour, my heart has known but one attachment. My pride, my manhood, has striven vainly to overcome this mastering passion." Naomi started at these words; the tenderness and sympa- thy of her woman's nature were thoroughly roused, and she raised her eyes to his face with a look which timidly and unconsciously revealed the confiding trust and purity of the love which moved her. He saw and quickly understood the emotions pictured upon her expressive and beautiful face. It thrilled his whole being, and he went on rapidly sketching his life for the last four months, - his call, his installation and settlement over   INTO THE LIGHT.         1 9l his present parish; and then, in glowing terms, he de- scribed how one sentiment had been intimately woven throughout every feeling and aspiration. "May I - dare I - say I love you, dearest friend? May I hope that in time that love may be returned, - the most priceless boon that Heaven can give to man?" In the changeful beauty of her glowing cheek Horace Vin- cent saw enough to encourage his fondest hopes. Raising her hand tenderier, he pressed it to his lips unreproved. 't Tell me, Naomi, dearest!" he murmured," will you accept a love as deep and true as man ever felt for woman?" "Naomi! Naomi!" again lie repeated, lingering upon the syllables of the name he loved with manly tenderness. "Are you mine?" Her low and trembling reply filled his heart with unutter- able joy. Placing both hands in his, with winning frankness, she simply said, - "I Yes! yours!" And thus the compact between those two young hearts was sealed; henceforth they were to go hand in hand along life's rugged pathway. Horace drew her arm within his, and together they saun- tered down the avenue of elms which led to the residence of Mr. Carrington. As he looked upon the fair face of his companion and noticed the varying color on her cheek, her downcast, tremblinrg lids, and the slight, happy smile, more eloquent than words, that yet lingered on her lips, he could not refrain from repeating those appropriate lines by Cole- ridge, - "O pure of heart! I need not ask of thee What this strong musio in the soul may be!" For it indeed revealed to them " a new earth and new heaven, undreamt of by the sensual and the proud." As they emerged from Elm Avenue they saw a lady ap- proaching them, who hal evidently been at the house. She  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7355-00000102"/> 200        INTO THE LIGHT. held in her hand, quite high in the air, a green silk parasol, with a very long handle, which protected an amber-colored silk bonnet, that had once been white, but had been washed and ironed out and made over so many times that it had lost somewhat of its pristine freshness and beauty. Her dress' of drab-colored alpaca, being gored quite narrow in the skirt, gave one the impression of an old-fashioned extin- guisher. The other hand held, suspended by a chail, a green velvet bag, secured by a steel clasp, which she was in the habit of opening and shutting most emphatically when in conversation. Polly Perkins (for it was she) came simper- ing along with her eyes opened wider than they had ever been before. She saw at once that she could gather a nice little bit of scandal, and rejoiced in the idea of having something to tell that would awaken a revival of interest in her stock, which had become quite low. She saw that she had been on the wrong scent altogether. Her keen eye noted the happy, uplifted faces before her, ald the caressing little hand which rested so lightly on the minister's arm, and she jumped from premise to conclusion immediately, and settled the whole thing in her mind before she courtesied in her stiff, prim way, and answered Mr. Vincent's kind in- quiries after her health. "Well, Miss Perkins," he continued, " how do you get along with your class in Sabbath school?" "Pretty well, sir, only I don't seem to interest the young ladies, -only little girls. Still I try to do what little I can, -to gdd my mite in the way of labor for the good of the church and society." Naomi felt an instinctive aversion to the owner of the small black eyes, that seemed to look her over all at once; but she spoke with her kindly and pleasantly, little dreaming that she would become a plotter against her peace. A busy- body in church matters has the means of doing more mischief in homes and families than the practised burglar who enters your house and steals your goods. Polly Perkins   INTO THE LIGHT.         201 was truly the  " pudding-stick" of the society over which the Rev. Horace Vincent presided, and therefore just at this time she had an accumulation of labor upon her hands, which quickened her steps, and caused her to bid them a hasty good- morning. She wished to properly circulate the facts she had pounced upon so unexpectedly, and forthwith proceeded to call upon Mrs. Munroe. That lady saw her visitor approach- ing rapidly up the gravel walk, and knew quite well that she was laden with something spicy. Wiping her hands hastily upon her apron, she slipped into the closet several jars of jelly, which she had been preserving,--for Miss Perkins was very fond of sweets, and generally happened in just when she would be most likely to obtain a portion. This day, however, no trace of the delicious fruit could be seen, but a fragrant smell, which made Miss Polly's mouth water, told her that she had come in just too late to assist. "As true as you live and breathe, Mrs. Munroe, our min- ister is courting the governess; and I thought all the time he liked Lucindy Safford." "What governess?" questioned her companion. "Why, who else but the young lady who sat in Mr. Car- rington's pew on Sunday, with those New York children? They do say that she is a Jewess, and will not eat any pork; but she keeps Sunday, I think, by the way she looked during prayer-time, and she bent her head as devout as any Chris- tian; for I watched her all the time." "I should not think Mr. Vincent would pay attention to anyT lady who was not a Christian," replied Mrs. Munroe. "St. Paul says, ' Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers,' and it appears to me that caution is far more important to ministers than it is to others." "There is a doubt in my mind," replied Polly, " whether she is a fit person to come into the society, and I don't see but that I have got to ferret it all out. Heigh-ho! What a busy world this is! What a world of care! some have one burden laid upon them, and some has another.  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7355-00000103"/> 202        INTO TEP LIGIIT. "Why, how red your face is, Mrs. Munroe! I do believe you have just done preserving, now, haven't you? I declare I wish I had come in a little sooner; for I know if they had been round handy that I should have had a taste, for there is nobody in L--  who makes jelly equal to you. I can say that; for I ougtht to know." Mrs. Munroe had in her hurry untied her apron, and tossed it into the closet, whither it was folloived by the kitten, 'who had chased wildly after the string. Puss, not likingC her close imprisonment, commenced scratching and crying to come out just as Miss Polly passed by the door. "Law sakes!" she exclaimed, " the cat is in that closet. I'll let the poor thing out; " and forthwith she proceeded to open the door, and, lo! the long row of jelly glasses stood revealed. Thie cat was indeed out of the bag. Mrs. Munro3 made a virtue of necessity, and said, "I would offer you some, Miss Perkins, but I thought they were not sufficiently cool; still, if you have a mind to carry a jar, you are quite welcome." Polly's steel clasp opened and shut with a nervous snap, her little black eyes twinkled, and she graciously remarked "that she never objected to the sweets of life, and always took what was offered her." Miss Polly's character was a curious compound made up of contradictions; although a gossip, she had not always been a vicious one; she sometimes reconciled small differences in the society, and was always a welcome visitor in families where there was a number of children; for she would some- times give the weary mother several days' sewing from pure kindness of heart and genuine pity for the overburdened ones. A small annuity sufficed for her few wants, and a portion of that, at times, went in charity, but secretly. Be- neath an unpromising exterior there were hidden some golden virtues, which she scrupulously tried to hide, taking a cyni- cal sort of pleasure in appearing worse than she really was. Mrs. Munroe thought beyond a doubt that the jelly-jar   INTO THE LIGHT.        203 rapidly disappearing from her sight, carried by Miss Polly, would help to relish for her more than one cup of Hyson; but it was not destined to see the inside of her quiet dwell- ing. The old blind Scotchman (Laura Vincent's friend) received it with delight, and it. served to allay a troublesome cough, while Polly hastened away, not waiting to receive his thanks. Aside from her inveterate habit of gossiping, she possessed great shrewdness and discernment of character. Her weak point lay in the conviction that she was still very youthful- lookiog, and quite attractive to gentlemen, although none had ever seriously aspired to the honor of her hand. She hoped the new minister might take him a wife from the vil- lage, and she believed she stood as good a chance as any. "Why not!" she soliloquized; " my teeth are good, my hair is not changed, and I am sure I could accomplish ilore in one day, as a minister's wife, than half a dozen of those young girls, who do nothing but read novels and embroider slippers; " therefore her heart experienced a sharp pang of disappointment when she apprehended at a glance the rela- tion in which the two she had just met stood to each other. A feeling of bitter animosity towards Naomi arose in her heart, and she was quite ready to sow the seed of discord and prejudice among the people to the best of her ability, saying to herself that the interests of the society alone in- fluenced her conduct. She paused a moment after she I ft the dwelling of the old blind man, to decide whither she should next direct her steps, when she observed a tall gentle- man approaching her, evidently a stranger. His large black eyes and swarthy complexion awakened her admiration, for she had all her life had the conviction, that she would one day marry a gentleman with "midnight eyes, and ebon hair," - a fortune-teller had told her so, - and she therefore blushed when he accosted her, smiling most blandly, and asking -the way to the hotel. Polly commenced nervously opening and shutting the steel clasp of her reticule, all the  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7355-00000104"/> 204       INTO THE LIGHT. time wishing that she had only put on her pink scarf, which gave a sort of bloom to her cheeks, and contrasted well Mith her drab-colored dress. "You have only to retrace your steps, sir," she replied, "to the foot of Locust Street, and that are large building, which you see on the right, is our only hotel. We are quiet people here, sir, and have not needed a public house until within a year oror two." "All, indeed!" replied her companion; " that accounts for the unmistakable air of refinement visible in the few whom I have met in my afternoon stroll; " at the same time bowing and glancing at the faded green parasol, and ancient-look- ing bonnet. "We have had a seminary, however, for a number of years in this place," returned Polly, with a satisfied simper; " and that, I guess, gives an appearance of culture which all towns do not possess." II You have also," replied her companion, ' two churches; one modest-looing little building yonder in the valley, and one upon the hill, with quite a graceful spire. Who preaches in that, may I ask?" "A man of considerable talent, some people think, but one that won't wear well, to my thinking. The Rev. Horace Vincent is no favorite of mine. He aint my style." "( Horace Vincent!" repeated the tall stranger, with an af- fected start of surprise. "Oh! ah! well, to speak frankly, miss, I think I may say, with you, that I think he will not wear well. I have some little knowledge of the gentleman, and admire the sagacity and penetration you possess in analyz- ing character. It is fortunate for him that all do not see as deeply as my new acquaintance, whose name is " and he paused, with another bland, superior smile. "Miss Perkins," she responded, with a slightly agitated manner, for he had called her miss, not madam, throughout the conversation, and of course thought her a young lady. No doubt she had made quite an impression. Of this she felt   INTO THE LIGHT.        205 assured when he stooped to pick up her handkerchief, which in her confusion she had dropped. He retained the snowy cambric, as she thoughlt, affectionately in his hands while he was talking, and, perceiving her name in the corner, he ex- claimed, "You rejoice in the name of Mary, Miss Perkins; my dear mother's name," he continued, with a sigh; "and I see you adopt the pretty abbreviation of Polly." Polly's keen eye scanned him, for a momeldt, curiously, in order to detect any latent irony in his remarks, -for the name was her detestation, and in sheer bravado she had it marked upon all four corners of her handkerchieif, - but nothing of the kind could she detect, and she thought it never sounded so musical before. "I like those abbreviations," he resumed, -"Fannie, Nel- lie, and Pollie,-pet names given in childhood, and often continued through life. Now my own name when a boy could never be anything more than plain Joe; and, by the way,- pardon me, miss, - I have your name, and have neglected to give my own;" and he took out an enamelled card from an elegant case and presented it to the delighted damsel, who saw at the same moment the name of Joseph Fleming and the glitter of a real diamond upon his hand, and began to feel that she was getting into- a romance very fast, as he said, "i Now, as we have been regularly introduced, you will not object to my walking a short distance while you tell me a little more about your beautiful town. I am so attracted by its charms that I may remain a day or two." And he plied her with questions until he had heard about the different families, and ascertained where Naomi was visiting, at the same time dropping a word now and then which deepened the bitter feelings which had arisen in her heart when she saw so plainly the evidence of happy requited affection in the youth- ful pair, - a bliss that she never in her whole life had known. She admired her new acquaintance all the more that he dis- liked the minister, and she was prepared just then to bicome a ready coadjutor in all his plans. Blinded by vanity, her 18  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7355-00000105"/> 206       INTO THE LIGHT. usual shrewdness had deserted her, and she thought how proud she should feel if the minister could only meet them at that moment. Then, indeed, he would see that others had more appreciation than himself. No one passed them, how- ever, except two boys, who laughed roguishy, and said, "There is Aunt Polly! Look, Tom, isn't she sweet on that gentleman?" Joseph Fleming heard as plainly as his companion, but he appeared to be lost in admiration of the distant scenery, while Polly mentally cuffed their ears, and resolved that their teacher should be informed of their ill-manners. "You say," continued Fleming, I that Mr. Carrington has a visitor, a governess, spending a week or two at the house. I wonder if her name is Heber?" "Oh, no! Hammet, I believe," replied Polly. "Pardon me; she is the same person I supposed; she has a particular friend by that name. You look surprised, Miss Perkins; nothing more than a friend, I assure you. I am sure I would not wish to say anything that would injure the young lady." "But," said Polly, eagerly, " you know more than you are willing to say. There is something not right." "' You must excuse me this time, Miss Perkins, -perhaps when we are a little more acquainted, - ahem. Do you walk often in this direction? I hope so, and that we may meet again. Farewell, miss," and he lifted his hat with a courtly grace, while the diamond upon his finger flashed forth a mocking light upon the vain little woman, whom he left in a flutter of excitement, elated at the evident conquest she had made, and overburdened with gossiping material. Polly made no other call that afternoon, but proceeded directly home with the precious card, closely secured by the steel clasp. Under her pillow it went that night, and the rosy dawn beheld her, on waking, search for the first tangi- ble btt of romance she had ever known, rejoiced to find it was not all a dream.   INTO THE LIGHT.         207 In the mean time Joseph Fleming sauntered to the hotel, engaged a room, and, taking out his memorandum-book, jot- ted down some items and plans for the ensuing day, resolving to obtain an interview with Naomi, if possible, the following evening. CHAPTER XXVII. It is well to distrust what we hear that makes us think worse of a man, and to accept a story's pleasantness as primafacie evidence of its truth. "OWELL. TWILIGHT settled softly down upon the hills and vales of L--. Nature wore an aspect of peace widely in contrast with the unquiet heart and lowering visage of the disappointed man who strolled moodily algng the grassy pathway, insensi- ble to its beauty. Taking a wide circuit, he approached the dwelling of Mr. Carrington in the rear, and, perceiving a win- dow upon the grounld-floor open a few inches, he looked in cautiously, raised it, and, without hesitation, entered a small anteroom, where a light was dimly burning. A piano stood open in an alcove at the side; some sheets of music lay upon the stand, as if some one had just left the instrument; upon a round table, near the window, stood a work-basket, which he unceremoniously searched, hoping to find something which would identify it as belonging to the fair Jewess; but no! a silver thimble with Julia's initials revealed the fact of its being her property., It was indeed a room seldom entered, except by Julia when she wished to practise, reserving her grand  piano for finished pieces. Naomi, on this evening, sought retirement. She longed to pour forth her joy in song, and, entering the room from the opposite door, she did not observe the tall figure crouching in the dark shadow. Play- "Ig a soft, sweet accompaniment, she sung a plaintive melody. - Ere she had finished, an arm was thrown around her, and for  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7355-00000106"/> 208        INTO THE LIGHT. one moment the lips of Joseph Fleming rested upon her fore- head. One wild cry of terror and disgust burst from Naomi as she sprang to her feet, while her cousin, hearing footsteps, disappeared through the window as noiselessly as he clame, and was soon lost to sight amid the thick shrubbery which surrounded the Hall. Mr. Carrington came hastily through an adjoining apart- ment, exclaiming, "My dear young lady, what has hap- pened? What alarmed you?" Ashamed to avow her relationship to the bold intruder, Naomi replied, "A man had entered this room from the win- dow, and had been here some moments before I was aware of his presence." "And through that open window he made his escape," said Mr. Carrington. "This is a very unusual occurrence in this town. Tom," he cried to his servant, "take your cap and come along with me; we will search the grounds, lest others be concealed in the neighborhood." Mrs. Goodrich and Julia plied Naomi with questions, in their excitement and earnestness, that sometimes she found it difficult to answer. Mr. Carrington returned shortly after, laughing off their fears, saying, "If Miss Hammet was afflicted with nerves, I might suppose it was a phantom of the ilmagination." Naomi, who was anxious that no further notice should be taken of so strange an incident, replied, but with so con- strained an effort that Mrs. Goodrich eyed her rather curi- ously, and advised her brother to have the servants watch alternately for several nights, lest the attempt might be re- peated with better success. Naomi sought her chamber, pained, mortified, and appre- hensive of future trouble through the persevering audacity of Joseph Fleming. She bathed her forehead again and again, to wash off, if possible, the hated kiss. She felt contami- nated ; a stifling sensation weighed her down with a nameless " terror. She raised the window and inhaled the pure evening   INTO THE LIGHT.        209 air. The peaceful stars shed their soft light upon her brow with a soothing influence that partially restored her usual serenity, yet she felt unequal to going downstairs again, and was relieved when Julia asked if she might come in and sit with her a while, as she was going back to New York so soon that every minute was precious. "You have been bathing your head, dear Miss Hammet, and I know you have the headache. I will not make it worse by my foolish chatter. Nay, I insist that you go right away to bed; papa will do without your evening carol, and I will sing ' Voices of the Night' to please him. Mr. Vincent has gone to a neighboring town, papa said, to attend a' funeral, and you have nothing to call you downstairs." Naomi felt grateful to the kind girl for a release from what had hitherto been a pleasing duty every evening of her visit, and she bade her good-night with an added tenderness; for she could not but see that the motherless girl had given her all her heart. The following day Joseph Fleming applied himself most industriously to the task of disseminating a prejudice against the new minister, as he was called; dropping a word here and there about his sermons having the reputation of being plagiarisms wherever he had preached in New York; re- marking that the inhabitants of L-- had too much sense to be deceived by so pretentious a preacher. ("Look-a-here, mister," exclaimed an honest farmer, who was sitting in the vestibule of the hotel, and who had listened to Fleming's vicious utterances with ill-concealed impatience, 'i I cannot, and will not, hear our good minister spoken against; whoever does it will be likely to run his face against my fist with rather more force than will be altogether pleas- ing. Why, sirs," he continued, turning to one or two idlers whom Fleming had addressed, " that man is not fit to black Mr. Vincent's shoes. One's light and t'other's darkness. There's a cloven foot hidden somewhere, you may depend." Fleming took no notice of this speech, but went on talking 18*  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7355-00000107"/> 210        Lsro THE LIGIT. with assumed indifrence, @feling, however, that the neigh- borhood was getting too hot to be comfortable; when he was again interrupted by another and younger man, with still more threatening emphasis and gesture. "Well, I can tell you, mister, if my temper gets riled with the sight of ye round here much longer; talking in that style, pra'aps I shall do mischief! I just wouldn't mind putting my foot on your fine broadcloth, and making ye bite the dust like ally snake." The Jew eyed the stalwart, brawny figure of the cough farmer, and felt that he was more than a match for him in sheer physical strength; so, merely casting a glance of con- tempt upon him, he turned upon his heel and sauntered slowly down the road, hoping to obtain another interview with Miss Polly Perkins. "It is an old saying," said another of the party, " that ' fine feathers make fine birds;' but that are sneaking Moses can never pass for an eagle while he caws like a darned crow." "Here, Charley!" shouted the first speaker to a little shock-headed boy, who was sitting astride the rail-fence whis- tling; 1" lend us your jews-harp, and lets play the ' Rogue's March.'"  A roar of laughter saluted Fleming's ears from the amused group he had left behind, and caused him to quicken his pace, for the farmer just then quoted Scripture to some purpose; and the application was too pertinent to fail of being appro-. priated. Miss Polly had consulted her glass many times that morn- ing, and had not ventured out as usual, her hair being in curl- papers; but she looked forward to an afternoon stroll, with the hope of meeting her new admirer, with almost juvenile impatience. A  pair of open-worked stockings with silk clocks, and the pink scarf, lay upon the bed, that was to give the finishing touch to her costume. Rheumatism  had at times made its pains felt in her system, and therefore stout shoes had usually protected her-in one sense - delicate   INTO THE LIGHT.        2" feet. Now, however, a thin pair of slippers, which looked decidedly youthful, were each receiving a prim rosette that reminded Miss Polly of her boarding-school days. The sun was getting low in the western sky, and had been hidden be- hind a cloud some time, when she sallied out with her insep- arable green velvet bag and parasol. She had not proceeded far down Locust Street, when she perceived a figure which she could not mistake approaching her, and her heart beat with a genuine timidity as he came near and with great courtesy inquired about her health. "How very kind of you, miss, to walk this way Il It is so pleasant not to feel altogether a stranger in a strange place!" and he bent his eyes upon her with a glance which was meant to be affectionate, but which took its expression from the vindictive feelings that were surging within, and almost startled the little woman by its fierceness. But that new emo- tion - for Miss Polly was not easily frightened - only gave zest and novelty to the interview. He soon led her to talk of the minister, and with satanic zeal and tact converted her from an indifferent friend into an active enemy. So inter- ested had they become in each other's conversation that the rain-cloud, which had been slowly rising for the last hour, suddenly discharged a pouring shower upon their devoted heads. Fleming politely offered to hold her parasol over her head, but the protection it afforded was but temporary; the heavy drops passed through the thin silk covering, leaving great green spots upon the white bonnet that never before had been treated so unceremoniously; and the wind, bent on a frolic, crept underneath the slender frame, and, bursting through the well-worn quarters, turned it inside out. Flem- ing bit his lips with extreme vexation, conscious that they presented a most absurd appearance as Mr. Carrington's, family carriage dashed by at that moment, and he recognized more than one merry face at the window. Gabrielle and Gazelle clapped their hands and laughed with uncontrollable mirth, for Miss Polly had always op-  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7355-00000108"/> 212        INTO THE LIGHT. posed the wearing of hoops, and her limp and saturated dress hung close to her figure; while she held the denuded parasol-- which she had snatched from her companion when she saw it flying into ribbons - at its utmost height above her head, in the vain attempt to shield the hopelessly ruined bonnet. Fleming had offered to escort her home, but'was strongly tempted to desert her then and there. Her loquacity had ceased, for it required her best efforts to keep up with his long and rapid strides. Suddenly she uttered a little cry and came to a full stop in the midst of a mud-puddle. "O Mr. Fleming!" she exclaimed, piteously, " my slip- per has come off, and I cannot go another step until you find it. What shall I do?" "Confound it!" muttered the irate gallant, as he took the hooked head of his cane and viciously groped for the shoe, which he soon broughlt up dripping finom its watery bed. Polly bravely plunged her foot into it, regardless of the open worked-stocking, and now, thoroughly provoked herself, she started off at a pace more than equal to his own. They had reached a little descent in the road, down which the water was rushing in torrents, making great gullies which rendered the walking anything but easy, so that Polly was obliged to slacken her pace and pick her way. She had planted one foot upon a large stone, and was preparing to give a juvenile spring across the mimic stream, when the treacllerous ground gave way beneath, and the stone rolled over suddenly, as she threw her weight upon it, and precipi- tated Miss Polly fairly into the middle of the road, fromn whence she arose in a sitting position, the very picture of resignation. Her misfortunes had reached their climax; fate Ahad nothing more in store for her. She had reached a point where she had become totally indifferent to everything. Fleming drew out a white pocket-handkerchief, clalpped it suddenly to his face and indulged in one irresistible spasm of laughter; then, really pitying the forlorn damsel, he inquired,-   INTO THE LIGHT.        213 "Are you hurt, madam?" "Well, what if I am?" she curtly replied; ' you do not seem disposed to assist me to rise." Joseph Fleming took from his pocket a kid glove, deliber- ately put it on, and extended his hand. Miss Polly remorse- lessly grasped it with her muddy cotton one, and rose to her feet. A few minutes longer brought them to the gate of her own domicile, and the fascinating city gentleman bade her good-evening. The seeds of discord which hle had sown lie wisely left to take root, and resolved to go back to the city that same evening, as Mrs. Armstrong had sent for the twins throlgh his instigation, and, of course, Naomi must return with them, and be deprived of the society oSler reverend admirer. With a perverseness not uncommon to weak minds, Polly, instead of blaming herself, laid all her misfortunes upon the shoulders of others, and felt justified in being revenged upon them for her disappointment and mortification. She wept over the wreck of millinery, which, being so ,stained, could never again be washed and ironed out; the frame, too, that fitted her head as no other frame ever could again, was all soaked away, and the millinet fell together like a mass of jelly. It was merely the ghost of a bonnet that renmained. "The light of other days " had faded, never to return. 'i  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7355-00000109"/> 214        INTO THE LIGHT. CHAPTER XXVIII. Alas I could we divine All that beneath the surface lies of pleasure's sparkling wine, Should we not find long-buried hopes, deep agony, and tears Unknown to all save Him alone who ever sees and hears V JOCELYN. "AURA VINCENT'S changing moods increased greatly after the afternoon fete at Col. Safford's. Grace was una* to persuade her to apply herself to anything continuously. Percy Bancroft seemed to be ruled by the same restless spirit; at one time all lover-like attention to Grace, at another lost in a gloomy study, which made him anything but an agreeable companion. One day lie called, saying that he had only fifteen minutes to spare. When he found that Laura was absent, he walked about the room, took up a book, and then a paper, in a dreamy, abstracted way, until Grace laughed in spite of the dull heartache which most of the time caused her soft blue eyes to wear a sad expression. 1"Why, monsieur!" she said, playfully, " are you getting demented? Does reason yet assert her lordly throne? The quarter of an hour which you had to spare has passed long since, and still you linger. Why were you in- such haste?" "Well, really, I cannot tell," he replied; " it was a neces- sity born of the moment, which has passed from my mind as quickly. Come, Grace, your fickle friend is himself again. Let me read to you something from Browning, which shall stimulate the mental faculties into healthy and vigorous action." Grace made no reply except to take up her sewing and sit an attentive listener. Percy had not been long reading when the street door closed and a light step was heard in the hall. A moment after Laura came quickly into the room bright and   INTO THE LIGHT.        215 glowing from the air and exercise she had taken during her afternoon walk. She had on a delicate pink dress, which tinted her fair complexion with almost transparent loveliness ; her cheeks were burning with a deeper hue, and her eyes were flashing with a troubled light, as she laid a letter in her sister's hand. "I do not know why he should do so, " she exclaimed, " but Harry Winthrop has presumed again to offer me his heart; to write of love to one who has scarcely ever bestowed a thought upon him. What shall I do with his letter, Grace?" The hall door had swung open as she entered, concealing for the moment the fact of Bancroft's presence. It was, therefore, with a start and cry of surprise that she saw him sprinag to his feet in great excitement and advance towards her, exclaiming, "FHow dare he think of such a thing!" at the same time making a caressing movement with his arm, as if he would fain draw her to him and fold her to his heart where none should dispute the prize. ' Why, Percy!" said Grace, as she looked at him with astonishment, "you show' altogether more feeling than is necessary about the matter. Harry Winthrop is a mere youth, and Laura is, I think, in no danger of bestowing her affections hastily; indeed, she hlas refused repeated invita- tions, recently, to places where she would be likely to meet those students who annoyed her with attentions." Laura cast down her eyes and turned towards the window to conceal the vivid blush that overspread her features when she observed Mr. Bancroft's tender, protecting mannier; and she was conscious 'of an impulse to obey his gesture, and nestle by his side like a wearied, trusting child. Percy recovered almost at once his usual nonchalant man- ner, and when he spoke again it was in a tone of light, easy badinage, that teased Laura, while it seemed to amuse him exceedingly. "I was on the poiht, little one, of doing battle for you,  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7355-00000110"/> 216       INTO THE LIGtIT. like a doughty knight, but with those bloodless word-weapons, which vanish into thin air, and leave no trace behind." "And then again," said Grace, " such weapons have been known to wound deeply, leaving ineffaceable scars." She said this almost unconsciously, feeling a dull pain at her heart, as if a sword-thrust had already been there. Bancroft, who had been dreamily playing with the cord and tassel of her apron, started as she Spoke, brushed back the luxuriant brown hair from his broad forehead with an im- petuous movement, and arose to take his leave, saying that he had an appointment in the city at eight o'clock that even- ing. He had purchased a lady's saddle-horse, which- he kept with his own, near by, and they had several times been to ride through the woods and shaded lanes of L--, with a keen sense of enjoyment which such out-door exercise only gives. They were going that afternoon, until Percy recol- lected his engagement. He did not seem in the mood for riding, and parted from Grace almost coldly, without the usual fond farewell, saying that to-morrow or next day would find him in his accustomed place by her side, if possible. Without casting a glance at Laura, he took his hat and went out hastily, in no very enviable state of mind. Always accustomed to have his own way from a boy, Percy Bancroft rebelled at the least constraint; and now he had vol- untarily thrown around himself fetters that were far from silken, and which he knew not how to break. Grace began to have a dim perception of Laura's variable demeanor. Could it be possible that her young heart had been given unsolicited? She would know more of this mys- tery. She sought her sister, resolved to will back, if possi- ble, the confidence of old. She found her in her chamber, weeping over something which she held in her hand, and which she hastily concealed; but not so quickly but that Grace saw that it was a photograph. Taking no notice of the movement, she put her arm around Laura, and tenderly inquired the cause of her tears.   INTO THE LIGHT.         217 For one moment she leaned her head on her sister's shoul- der, and then drew herself petulantly away. "No cause of any consequence," she replied. "But I know there must be something," said Grace, ten- derly. "Will you not tell me, dear?" "Never!" replied Laura, emphatically. ' Sister Grace, do you remember when I was a little child, and grew perverse and wilful, that you used to leave mea to myself until the cloud passed and the sun broke forth? I will come down and read to grandfather presently, and you must not care about these silly tears." And she smiled a forced smile, that made the generous heart of Grace ache for the lamb she had so tenderly nurtured, and for whom, even then, she was willing to make any sacrifice. She left her without another word, and patiently went about her daily duties with a heavy heart, - a heart whose pent-up agony longed for seclusion, where she might, with one bitter wail, pour forth her grief and dis- appointment, unrestrained. Her grandfather's feebleness required her constant care, and once, when she came near him, he seemed to apprehend that some grief lay at her heart, for he laid his hand gently on her head and pronounced a tender benediction. "Dear child! The Lord bless thee, and keep thee, and make his light to shine upon thee, and give thee peace." By an effort Grace kept down the rising tears, and patted his hand tenderly, as was her wont, in reply, feeling that in the Lord only could she find the strength necessary for the self-renunciation which she had resolved should be hers, rather than cause unhappiness to one who had been be- queathed to her as a sacred trust. Laura soon came in with scarcely a trace of emotion upon her fair young face, and, taking the Bible, at her grand- father's request, she commenced reading to him one of the psalms he loved so well.,      It was an unusual thing for Grace to be absent at the even- ing reading; but at that hour a stifling sensation oppressed 19 '  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7355-00000111"/> 218        INTO THE LIGHT. and weighed her down. She longed for the open air, for sol- itude; and, throwing on her straw hat, passed quickly out of the garden-gate on towards a grassy knoll, surmounted by a group of trees, whose heavy foliage cast into deep shadow the rustic seat she had so often sought when life was one sweet dream of joy, and there wrestled with her great grief. Dim shadows crept over and closed around her like a fate, and the vague apprehensions -which had heretofore been like twilight mists in her soul, shutting out the light and sunshine whenever they came - began to assume form and assert their presence as realities with persistent importunity. She felt sure that a change had come over her " love-lit dream." She remembered how often of late Percy Bancroft's greeting, when they met, had cast a sudden chill of disap- pointment over her. Why was this? Where was the subtle magnetism that had drawn her near him so fondly and so confidingly that her heart revelled in the sweet fulness of content, asking nothing more than simply to be in his pres- ence? Deeper and darker came the doubt and the fear, unlil affection's fount grew bitter and its golden streams ran dry. The glowing passion-flowers of her heart lay crushed and withered in that evening hour. No more in melody its life- pulse beat responsively to love, for broken were its tuneful chords, and life seemed utter weariness when hope and trust grew dim. As Grace bent her head beneath the weight of these surg- ing, anguished thoughts, she recalled the words of the Psalm- ist, "All thy waves and thy billows have gone over me." She felt herself drifting - drifting away from faith and love, and all that makes this mortal existence divinely beautiful - out into the sea of wild despair. Suddenly the liquid notes of a woodland bird, singing its evening song of prlse, fell on her ear, bringing her back to the sweet sounds of nature, and leading her mind upward to nature's Author, - the one anchor of the sou 1, sure and stevad-   INTO THE LIGHT.        219 fast, which had well-nigh slipped from her grasp, -while there floated over the seething billows of thought, like oil upon the troubled waters, the Saviour's comforting words, "Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth give I unto you; " and a sense of gratitude arose in her heart that God had granted to the sorrowing ones of earth the great privilege of prayer, - that she miglit, and could, commune with the great Source of all ight and love through Christ, whose presence then seemed to over- shadlow her heart like a benediction, as she received his prom- ise and made it her own; while with one bound her bruised spirit threw off the shackles of grief, doubt, and rebellion, even, that had been weighing her down, and again emerged "into the light" of humble, childlike trust, strong in the Lord, and ready for any future trial. At the same hour the mists, which had rested upon the distant woods floated silently and slowly away, and over the tree-tops and through the valleys there streamed the golden beams of the newly risen moon, and nature also experienced the mysterious transition from darkness to light. As Grace moved towards the house there came into her mind those clear bugle-notes of cheer that have roused to patient, earnest effort more than one weary watcher for the dawn, - "Triumph in the strength Of an exalted purpose! Eagle-like Press sunward on. Thou shalt not be alone. Have but an eye on God, as surely God Will have an eye on thee. Press on! press on!" And she dimly apprehended that unseen holy influences had clustered thickly around her, although she knew not that angelic, loving hands had that hour enwreathed her brow with a victor's crown. Grace quickened her steps as she observed, with some curiosity, the tall, angular figure of a man standing at the  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7355-00000112"/> 220        INTO THE LRGHT. gate, evidently waiting her approach. He saluted her with an awkward bow as she drew near, at the same time taking off his old straw hat with one hand, while the other pushed back the flax-colored hair from a good-humored, freclletl face, with honest blue eyes, and then dived down deep into the pocket of the countryman's frock, which he wore, and brought forth a note. His cheek glowed like a full-blown peony as he stammered an apolorgy, begging her to excuse hiln fIr not bringing it yesterday, sayingi that he had charge of Mr. Ban- croft's horses, whenever le canle to L---, and that, mecting him in the city, he had commissioned him to bring the billet directly to her. 't And why did you not?" inquired Grace, gently. "Well, you see my Liddy starched this frock of mine so mortal stiff that when I tried to get into the front pocket it was ironed down tight, so I handed the nlote to Sim,l and toldl him to find a pocket somewhere, and the pesky clitter slipped it in on purpose between the outside and back lining; and I tell you, Lid and me have spent the most of our time hunt-: ing for it since. I've heerd of looking for a needle in a hay- mow, but that aint a circumstance to the search we had for that ar' letter;" and he wiped the perspiration - which had started to his forehead in great drops at the very thoughlt-  with a blue cotton handkerchief, and stood awaiting her reply. "Did Mr. Bancroft give you any message with it?" in- quired Grace. "No, he didn't; but I thought he was going to once, for he came back and stood a moment sort of onsartain, and then went off again. I hope you won't think hard of me, Miss Vincent, for being so careless?" "Oh, no, not at all; it was not intentional, you know," replied Grace, with a kindly smile. Josiah Bent brightened up under its genial influence, and thought, as he walked off towards home whistling "Hail Co- lumbia," how sweet and beautiful it would be if Liddy would   INTO THE LIGHT.         221 only speak in those gentle, quiet tones. And there arose in his untutored mind a dim yearning for a higher, a truer life than he had yet known; a life of thought, culture, and beauty, whose portals he had never entered. Grace caught a glimpse of Laura's blue lawn dress behind the honeysuckle vines which shaded the porch, and knew that she had been impatiently awaiting her return. There was a timid, deprecating look in Laura's eyes when she met her sister's, which seemed to say "Love me, Grace! although I have been so wilful and changeable." At the same time she noticed the dampness of the evening air, and hastily trans- ferred a soft, white zephyr sontag she had worn, to her sister's shoulders, with a slight caress. "Why, Grace, it seemed as if half the house was gone while you were absent to-night. Grandfather kept asking for you and was real contrary; did not want Aunt Hannah to put him to bed, and insisted upon smoking his pipe in the parlor, - a thing he never did before. It seems to me that you are like the mainspring of a watch on which the whole ma- chinery depends; if you were not here to wind us up and set us a-going, I verily believe we should all run down, stop ticking, and be just good for nothing." Grace did not reply, but the conviction grew stronger in her mind that her duty lay just there where so much de- pended daily and hourlly upon her ministering care, "By the way," continued Laura, " what did Josiah Bent want? I saw him coming down the road so fast, like a tall steam engine, and I thought he had something important on hand." "Only a note from Percy," Grace replied, in a careless tone. "I suppose it is some apology for not coming as he promised." "Oh, indeed," said Laura; '"I would tell him that I did not think it was fair for him to disappoint us so and make us watch and wait; at least - I mean -make you watch for and expect him." 19*  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7355-00000113"/> 222        INTO THE LIGHT. Grace took no notice of the confused manner which fol- lowed this speech, understanding it all; but left a tender kiss upon her cheek as they parted for the night with a silent benediction. Laura thought, as she entered her little room, how precious and holy was a sister's love. Would any other ever be so dear? While Grace felt, as she opened her note, that no sacrifice was too great for the sweet child of her care. 'Does not the imood of the writer sometimes strangely permeate the white sheet on which he has written words that are often contradicted by this nameless subtile influence, and the aura, essence, call it what you will, of truth over- lies the page and the sentiment, and reveals the insincerity of mere protestation? When Grace first glanced at Percy's note, how was it that she read so plainly what had been wholly and carefully erased?"Dear friend" had been exchanged for "Grace, dearest," as if an effort had been made, without the heart's assent, to appear the devoted lover he once believed himself to be. "Do not," he wrote, I' chide me for my absence, but take me in trust, - will you not? - without one word of explanation just now. Could I give it.? I ask myself. It is beyond my power. When I have attempted an analysis of my mental condition, it has reminded me of a picture I once saw of the world emerging out of chaos; the tumultuous elements seem- ingly driven about in inextricable confusion; and yet I knew that underneath it all the mighty law of order had gathered together the atoms, concentrated the masses, and rounded out the solid earth, until it one day hung in space a perfect globe. Will order and peace ever again assert their suprem- acy in this unsatisfied, restless nature of mine, so disturbed by mental strife? Will you, Grace, supply the influence my character requires to constitute a full-orbed, harmonious whole? Do not think I have taken leave of my senses.   INTO THE LIGHT.         223 Would that I might quaff the Lethean cup and steep them in forgetfulness a while, when thought applies the stinging lash of censure, over errors of the judgment and the heart. "Why do I invade the calm quiet, the serene heaven of your mind with rhapsodies such as these? You would not know me, would you, Grace? I scarcely know myself at such times, and yet half an hour hence I shall look back - I have done it before-with comparative indifference upon feelings that now move me so strongly. "Pardon me, sweet girl, for giving you a glimpse of the present inner life of one you have honored with your love. Some time I may explain what now may seem paradoxical, - for it is your right. I will come to you, perhaps to-morrow, when you must not remember that I have ever appeared to you other than your sober friend and devoted lover, "PERCY BANCROFT." The selfish tone of this letter was apparent even to the charitable heart of Grace; yet it was redeemed somewhat by the bitter regrets which pervaded it. It was well that she had recently had a taste of that divine food, in the strength of which Elijah went forty days and forty nights unto Horeh, the mount of God, or the partial revelation of this strange, rambling epistle would have crushed out all that was kindly in her nature, and left her morose, desolate, and alone. But as, one by one, she put aside cherished memories of vanished joys, a calm and restful peace came stealing over her mind, with the thought that there is a realm where the fountain of love is exhaustless, - subject to no change, al- though on angel's pinions we may trace cycle after cycle in the wondrous scale of being.  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7355-00000114"/> 224         INTO THE LIGHT. CHAPTER Xxrx. "The sun comes up and the sun goes down, And days and nights are the same as one. The year grows green, and the year grows brown, And what is it all when all is done? Grains of sombre or shining sand, Sliding in and out the hand." So the dreams depart, So the fading phantoms flee, And the sharp reality Now must act its part. WESTWOOD. THE following afternoon brought Percy Bancroft again, who, restless and uneasy, desired constant change, and felt drawn, as by a magnet, back to the household he had quitted so hastily on the day of his last visit. The sun was setting gloriously, and he stopped on his way and ordered the horses to be brought to the house for a ride, feeling the necessity of physical activity to counteract the mental stimuli that had made his brain throb and pulse beat with unnatural acceler- ation. The faint piny fragrance of the waving woods, mingling with the sweet scent of clover-blooms, the twitter of birds, the lowing of cattle, the cool, healthful air, served to lift the weight of depression which had rested upon Percy's mind, and he began to feel, with 'his usual fickleness, that he had been altogether too unhappy, too miserable, in view of possi- ble contingencies. Perhaps, after all, he was mistaken; he would have no blighted flowers of the affections cast their withered leaves along his pathway. No!' both principle and feeling forbade it. And he felt strong for himself and others. "There is nothing like the open air and sunshine to dissi-   INTO THE LIGHT.        225 pate a fit of the blues," he murmured. "Grace cannot resist its influence, even if she look to-day as pale as when we last met. How like a drooping lily she seemed, the sweet girl! I can soon bring the happy light back to her soft blue eyes, and she never need know that I have f'or a moment been recreant towards her in heart." Strange to say, until that moment the recollection of his strange, hasty letter had escaped him; and, uttering an im- patient exclamation at his folly, he resolved to treat the whole matter as a joke, should she ask an explanation. Percy Bancroft, although what is termed a man of the world, had a tender heart where a woman was concerned, and would never have offered love willingly and deliberately to any unless with true and honorable motives; but stifle emotion and thought as he would, he could not resist the conviction that he had made a great mistake, and he despised himself for it. All the more tenderly did he greet Grace, while he pitied her, as she came to meet him, looking worn and strikingly pale. This, at first, he did not observe, but put his arm around her and imprinted a kiss on her brow. "Only this once," she murmured to lherself. "I may take this last caress; " and her eyes, in spite of herself, were suf- fused with tears. Percy inquired the cause in a quick, ten- der, anxious tone. She complained of the headache ; and when he told her the horses were at the door, and the clear evening air would be the greatest panacea for the pain, she gently, but decidedly, declined; feeling, as she told him, really too unwell for so much exertion. "Laura may go, if she is willing, but you must be very- careful of her, as you know she is timid on a horse, and has never ridden until this season. I know she needs the exer- cise, and I would really like to have her go," said Grace, as she met Percy's sorrowful, inquiring gaze.  "Laura, my dear," she said to her sister, who was seated near the window, netting, " you were not very well yester-  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7355-00000115"/> 226        INTO THE LIGHT. day, and Mr. Bancroft would like to have you ride. Will you go?" Laura looked wishfully out of the window, where stood the two horses, then out upon the green meadow, the level road, and the bright sunset. "Do you wish me to go, Grace?" "Certainly I do, darling. Get your habit, hat, and gloves, and bring back the roses, if possible, upon your cheeks, that have fled to-day." Laura obeyed; and, after a few moluents, returned, dressed in a dark-blue riding-habit, that enhanced the clearness of her fair complexion, while a black hat and feather made her look quite womanly and dignified for the moment. Placing her little foot in Percy's hand, she sprang lightly into the saddle, and was off at some distance down the road before he had mounted. She drew up her horse at length, and awaited his coming. As she turned and looked back at him archly, he thought he had never seen her look so be- witchingly beautiful. The last rays of the setting sun lighted up her chestnut curls with a golden hue, her eyes were flashing with eager- ness for a race, and her rose-bud lips were half parted with a smile of defiance as she lifted her slight riding-whip, saying, "Shall we start?" "I do not think it safe, Miss Laura, to race; you are not yet accomplished enough as a horsewoman; you have not sufficient command of the animal you ride. I think we must be content with the ordinary pace." He spoke quite coldly, and she replied as frigidly. "I am quite indifferent, Mr. Banlcroft; indeed, I did not care much about riding at all, but Grace seemed to wish it." They rode on in silence for some minutes. Percy watched the expressive changes of her countenance, as her eye seemed to take in the beauty of the surrounding scenery,- the shadowy wood, the deep and mossy glen, the mingled light and shade that flickered through 'the maples and birches which grew by the roadside, the silvery glow of the sun's last   INTO THE LIGHT.        227 gleam as it rested upon the crests of the attendant clouds that were waiting in the west the departure of the god of day, and the light falling spray of a mimic waterfall that dashed capriciously over projecting crags that looked down upon a ravine of wild beauty, where the trailing arbutus flowers were nestling among the dark-green leaves, and the early wild roses had been kissed into life by the warm breath of spring. At lengcth he spoke, and recalled her attention to himself, to that idea which was pervading his own mind and disturb- ing his peace.. "Miss Laura, do you know what bright prospects you put from you when you discouraged the attentions of Harry Winthrop? He will be the possessor of nearly half a million; he is handsome and accomplished." "I think he is very handsome," replied Laura, demurely; "more so, indeed, than any gentleman I know. Grace says she noticed his slight but elegant figure and easy, graceful carriage the first time she saw him, and, more than that, his truthful-looking, honest gray eyes." Bancroft winced under these praises, as he noticed Laura's animated expression and listened to her enthusiastic words. A spirit of mischief seemed to possess her as he grew diani- fied and patronizing. In cold, measured tones, he said, "Per- haps you may repent of your resolution, and yet become Mrs. Winthrop." '"I do not know but that I may," she replied, with a ring- ing, silvery laugh, which had a spice of malice in it. "I think he is splendid. Do not you?"      ?" "Certainly I do; and then he has those solid charms that are not to be despised in this our enlightened age where money is king," said Percy, bitterly. "Heigho! I am getting weary," she exclaimed, after they had ridden about a mile further. "Grace will be waiting. Shall we return?" "Certainly, if you wish it," replied Percy, coldly. And they turned their horses' heads immediately homeward, nei-  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7355-00000116"/> 228        INTO THE LIGHT. ther of them satisfied with-their ride, and both feeling leagues apart. "Now, Laura," said Percy, as they approached the house, "touch Fanny slightly with the whip, and let us canter up in style, that Grace may see that you have improved by this evening's lesson in riding." They started on the full gallop, when, just as they reached the greensward in front of the house, a cow, chased by several boys and a dog, came rush- ing down the road. Laura's horse became ungovernable, pranced, reared, broke a girth that had been imperfectly fast- ened, and threw her violently on the ground. The tremen- dous shock rendered her insensible. Bancroft sprang from his horse, raised her gently in his arms, and, by every endearing epithet, tried to call her back to life. Grace rushed from the house, pale with excitement, followed by her brother Horace, who had just arrived frorm the city. They heard his passionate words: "My life! my darling! my heart's treasure!" He put aside her brother, raised her in his arms, and carried her tenderly into the . house, laid her upon the sofa, and knelt beside her, almost frantic with fear and apprehension. Horace had heard enough to open to him a new and start-, ling revelation. And when Laura opened her eyes, looked about her wildly, half raised herself from her reclining posi- tion, and met that gaze, so intensely tender and impassioned, she closed them again, and, turning towards him, rested her head upon his shoulder. Both arms were instantly folded around her, and he fondly murmured, "My own birdling! you are safe." A bright,. glad smile broke over her face, and she raised herself from his encircling arms to meet the sad, heart-stricken expression of her sister Grace. Full consciousness returning, by a quick revulsion of feeling she burst into tears and flung, herself into her sister's arms. 's Never mind, dear one," faltered Grace; ' I know and   INTO THE LIGHT.         229 understand all, -it is best so; and I am willing," she whis- pered. An expression of mental and physical pain crossed Laura's features, and she said, L"Lay me on the sofa." A sudden faintness again assailed her, for her ankle had been slightly sprained, and the pain for the moment was intense. She ex- perienced instant relief, however, as she assumed a reclining position, but the pleading, troubled look in her eyes re- mained. "O Horace, can Grace ever forgive me?" she trcm lilincly and tearfully murmured. "I did not mean this; believe me that I did not." Percy Bancroft then came to her assistance, and, in a feel- ing, manly manner said to her brother, "You must believe me, Horace, when I tell you that this attachment has come upon us both most insidiously and unsought. I have never attempted to excite an interest in her young heart, xand I was not myself aware of the strength and depth of my own feel- ings, until I saw my idol, as it were, suddenly snatched, from me. I have nothing to offer in extenuationl for my prema- ture offer to one whom I thought so dear, and who is still, and ever will be, I trust, my dearest friend and sister." "Percy," said Grace, in low, sweet tones, "I knew, or thought I knew, of this, before you unconsciously revealed it. The worst struggle has passed with me when you knew it not. I am willing Laura should be yours; and, when you take her, teach her to love all that is good and pure, and never vitiate her young mind by any sceptical doubts." "Never!" earnestly replied Percy. "I never saw the beauty of a true Christian character so'exemplified before, and I believe now that one can draw strength from the divine Master more directly than I ever thought it possible." He bowed over Grace's hand reverently, wrung that of Horace, cast a loving, tender glance at Laura, and departed. 20  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7355-00000117"/> 2830        INTO THE LIGHT. CHAPTER XX X. God, in placing her beside me, Made my being most complete, And my heart keeps time forever With the music of her feet. MRS. HORSFORD. What love is, if thou would'st be taught, Thy heart must teach alone,- Two hearts withl but a single thought, Two hearts- that beat as one. PARTHENIA, IN "INGOMAR." WHEN Horace and Naomi communicated the fact of their betrothal to Mr. Carrington and his sister, it was received with unalloyed delight, nothing more being wanted in their estimation to make their choice of a minister altogether a perfect one. With genuine kind-heartedness Horace was in- vited to the Hall every day during their visit, and the lovers enjoyed some rare moments of pure and sweet companionship. Naomi was surprised and pained when she learned of Grace Vincent's bitter disappointment, and it threw a shadow over her own bright anticipations. She had beheld the charming spot where stood what was called the " minister's house," that was soon to be her happy home, and Horace urged their marriage as soon as it was ready for occupancy. He had written to Naomi's mother, asking her consent, and a letter, which attracted him most strongly towards her, was received in reply. It was arranged that the marriage should take place at the pastor's own church, and the mother of Naomi was invited to spend some time previous to the wedding with her daughter at Briarwood Hall, and accompany the bridal party home. The time allotted for the children's visit had nearly expired,   INTO THE LIGHT.        231 when a letter came from Mrs. Armstrong containing a per- emptory summons for their immediate return to New York. Horace Vincent greatly desired to accompany them home, and thereby assert his right over the precious charge that would soon become wholly and forever his own; but for obvious reasons it was thought best to have the twins re- turn the same way they came. And they parted with glad anticipations of a sunny future. Naomi was surprised and pained, on their arrival, at her cool reception. The children were warmly welcomed, but Mrs. Armstrong was haughty and supercilious; even her husband, who had always been the true gentleman in his courteous demeanor towards her, seemed to look upon her with suspicion, and treated her with supreme indifference. There had been plots against her peace. Joseph Fleming had most industriously disseminated insinuations against her fair fame, - had even implicated Dr. Heber, - with the hope if she lost her situation as governess, that she would at last turn to him in her hour of need, and he would triumph over her haughty airs, and rule his Jewish princess with a rod of iron. He needed but this, he thought, to complete the finest establishment in the city. Naomi did not wonder after her insolent reception, even by the servants, that she should receive a summons (at that time after she entered her chamber) to come down into the drawing-room, as Mrs. Armstrong wished to- see her on par- ticular business. She threw off her shawl and bonnet, and descended with a light, elastic step; for the well-spring of joy at her heart was still overflowing with happy thoughts, and she had been thinking how and when she might best com- municate her possible departure before many weeks. M1rs. Armstrong was elegantly dressed, and evidently in- clined to intimidate and assert a supremacy over the young governess in the only way possible, by outward display, feel- ing her immense superiority in point of intellect; therefore she kept her standing while she said, -  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7355-00000118"/> 232        INTO THE LIGHT. "Miss Hammet, I find it necessary for various reasons, which will remain for the present unexplained, to say to you, that I shall not require your services as governess for my daughters any longer." She paused a moment, to observe the effect of her announcement; but not perceiving the slightest agitation, she continued, "T Whoever has charge of my daughters must be above suspicion, and beyond re- proach." "I trust," said Naomi, with gentle dignity, c' that their present teacher answers fully to both of those requirements. If aught has been said to militate against my character; if any aspersions have been cast upon me, I rise superior to them all, in the consciousness of strict integrity. "I regret extremely that you have allowed your mind to be poisoned against one who has been faithflul to the trust reposed in her. You have very lovely children, and I trust you will exercise the utmost care and prudence in your choice of my successor." Mrs. Armstrong felt small and insignificant before the calm dignity and self-possession displayed in Naomi's man- ner. She placed a pocket-book in her hand, containing the amount of her salary, and Naomi asked her to allow Tom to call a carriage immediately. This sudden movement was not what Mrs. Armstrong expected or desired; - she knew the children were devotedly fond of their beautiful teacher, and she dreaded a scene. Naomi went into the school-room and called the twins to her, and, in gentle terms, told them that she was about to leave them; that she was pained to part with them so sud- denly, but that it was for their mother's happiness, as well as her own; and that some time, when the obstacles to their present intercourse were removed, they should come and see her. Gazelle opened her eyes wide, in alarm and astonishment,- "You cannot mean what you say! You are not going away never to return?"   INTO THE LIGHT.        233 "I fear that it is so, my child," replied Naomi, tenderly. "I cannot bear it! and I won't," said Gabrielle. "I will ask my papa, and he will prevent it." Gazelle had been fixedly staring at her governess, from the time she first spoke, - her breast heaving, her eyes dilat- ing, until suddenly she burst forth in a succession of frantic, heart-rending screams, that roused the whole household, and then went into convulsions. Her father came, and attempted to bear her away, but was unable to loose her fingers from their, clasp of Naomi's dress. Mrs. Armstrong, who knew not the nature of convulsions, feared that her child was dying, and humbly entreated Naomi not to leave her until consciousness was restored. Naomi weeping, tenderly raised her in her arms, held her firmly until her limbs relaxed, spoke to her soothing words of love, and her sobs grew fainter, and she opened her eyes to behold her teacher's face bending over her in anxious solicitude and love. Both arms were suddenly thrown round her neck, and she murmured, - "O Miss Hammet, don't leave me!" I must, my darling;and if you love me, you will not pain me by yielding to such violent grief." Gazelle drew fonl her neck the little locket, -her Christ- mas gift, -and Naomi saw that it contained a curl of dark hair. 4"I cut it off one day," she said, " to keep until you give me the picture you promised." "I will give it to you," replied Naomi, " when your father shall become convinced that it is proper for you to possess it. You shall conme then, Zella, and visit me in my new home; now do not pain me by weeping any more, for it will make me very unhappy to leave you thus." Gazelle held up her mouth to be kissed; Gabrielle clung about her with a tearful farewell, and Mr. Armstrong ad- vanced, put out his hand, and said, "I regret extremely, Miss Hammet, that there should have been anything to hasten your departure from us, and we will hope that it has 20*  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7355-00000119"/> 234        INTO THE LIGHT. been altogether a libel, which time will show to be wholly unfounded." Naomi was touched by his kind manner, and could with difficulty restrain her tears. Giving Gazelle one more kiss, she .passed hastily downstairs, and entered the carriage, which had been waiting nearly an hour. As it rolled rapidly along, an entirely new class of emotions filled her mind. She was going to enjoy the uninterrupted society of her devoted mother; she was free to come and go when and where she pleased; not many days would pass, before she would behold the beloved of her heart, and soon, per- haps, her good friend, Dr. Heber, to whom she had written directly after her engagement to Mr. Vincent. The carriage stopped at the door of her mother's humble dwelling, as the very object of her thoughts was passing out with his fine features lighted up with the good tidings he had heard, more minutely, from her mother's lips. Springing forward with great delight, he assisted her out of the car- riage, had the driver attend to her trunk, and went in and witnessed the meeting between the mother and daughter with a truly fatherly affection and satisfaction. But the fact that was to impart the most joy to his friendly heart was yet to be communicated. He learned from. Naomi's own lips, of her faith in the Messiah, - her hope as a Christian. "6 What will you say, doctor, when I tell you that, since I saw you last, I have lived years, as it were, within the sanctuary of my soul; that the germ of religion, which I have always guarded with jealous care, after the manner of that servant who hid his Lord's treasure in the earth, has developed, not into a perfect flower, but some few leaves lhave gradually unfolded; clearly indicating that the inner vitality is at last making a vigorous effort to reach that ligiht and love after which it has so long panted?" "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel! who is daily revealing himself to his chosen people, through his beloved Son," said the doctor, earnestly. "' Again I say, ' at eventide it shall be light.' "   INTO THE LIGHT.        235 "But, doctor," continued Naomi, "I have as yet ascended only'a few steps of that temple of Faith whose doors are opened wide to encourage those who are far below that they may freely enter its portals, on the strong wings of earnest prayer, to dwell in the lirght and joy of Christ's presence forever. "I have been plodding upward step by step, sometimes heavily burdened by doubts, feeling the poverty and insuffi- ciency of the gift I would lay upon the altar, without fully recognizing that within that holy Temple is a great High- priest, the divine Messiah, who presents himself as the offering instead of our own sinful hearts." Dr. H-Ieber listened to her eloquence with wonder and de- light, but Ilade no other reply than a quotation from that Holy Wordl which was his constant guide and study: "They that wait upon the 'Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up on wings as eagles; they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint." "That is true," replied Naomi; 1" but sometimes a clear note will reach me, - a radiant thought of hope and beauty from Him who has compassion on our infirmities, - and I will essay to spread my pinions and soar aloft, only to feel that as yet I do not possess the angel plumage necessary to bear me constantly heavenward. In your upward progress, doctor, you must often send back a ray of light, a word of encouragement, to one who has but just attempted to enter that path over which religion sheds so holy and benign an influence. But, to return to more material things, I have not yet told you of the cause of my sudden departure from the house of Mr. Armstrong." 'The doctor was all attention while Naomi related the principal events of the last few hours. 4"That wily fox, Fleming, is at the bottom of this," he cried. "Now we must frustrate his plans by the most entire secrecy as to the place of your abode. You and your mother must leave the kind friends, where she has been so long,  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7355-00000120"/> 23.6       INTO THE LIGHT. until the wedding-day draws near, and go elsewhere in some quiet location where you will not be molested by his visits." "But, doctor," said Mrs. Hammet, "I know of no such place among our own people where we should be free from intrusion. The fact that my husband died a Christian is quite sufficient to close their homes and hearts against those they pretend to call the apostate daughters of Israel. There are times when my heart yearns over our nation, when I admit the thought, for one moment, of the possibility that they are altogether mistaken,--that they are walking in darkness, aliens from the land of their heritage, through unbelief. There was a time when I, too, felt a peculiar bit- terness towards those who renounced the Hebrew faith; but now, although I cannot see and believe as my daughter does, yet I respect the doctrine which imparts so much peace in the hour of death." "And through eternity so much joy," replied the doctor, in a low tone. "I know," lie continued, " a family who are, I trust, wholly Jews, accordinog to my iidea, who would de- light to receive you. It is at the house of a particular friend of mine, where you can both be perfectly at home for the ensuing fortnight. Some time before the marriage, you say, is to be spent at Briarwood Hall. If you will submit your- selves to my guidance, ladies, I will see that everything is arranged immediately, and call for you in about an hour." "Most willingly and thankfully," they replied. And the doctor hurried forth, while Mrs. Hammet hastily packed her war drobe, and, telling Moses Nathans' family that she would see them again in a few weeks, they awaited the coming of t!heir friend with impatience lest Joseph Fleming should sur- prise them on the point of departure. "Here comes the doctor!" cried Naomi, joyfully, who had been watching from the window. "Now let me tie your bonnet, mother dear! How handsome you have grown!"- kissing her soft cheek. "I shall be quite proud of my mother at Briarwood Hall."   INTO THE LIGHT.        237 The good doctor handed them into the carriage, and enter- tained them by the way wy ith many a sparkling bon-'mot and anecdote. He was evidently in high glee, and preparincg to enjoy the surprise which awaited them. They stopped before a handsome residence, whose aspect was perfectly familiar, and the doctor proceeded to alight, saying '" that his very particular friend was waiting to bid them welcome." "Why, doctor, this is your own dwelling; and there is Mrs. Heber at the door! Are we to call here? I thank you for the opportunity." And they ascended the steps to meet and embrace her who had been a willing coadjutor with her husband in all his kind attentions to them both. "Ladies," said the doctor, with a smile of good humor, "you put yourself under my guidance, and I have brought you to a landlady who will do her best to make you perfectly at home. I knew your fastidious sense of independence would arise in some objection to a measure which will give myself and wife so much pleasure, and so I took the reins in my own hands, and here we are! And now," continued the doctor, rubbing his hands and laughing heartily, ' I think you can preserve an incognito5 and disappoint the best laid plans of our friend Joseph, who will assuredly come to grief before many weeks." Mrs. Heber went with them to their rooms, and, by her frank, tender, and cordial manner, made them feel as if they were conferrg in instead of receiving a favor. Naomi sat clown and wrote a note to Mr. Vincent, telling him of the cause of their removal, and, by Mrs. Heber's request, invit- ing him there whenever he could leave his parish duties. As soon as Mrs. Heber left the apartment, Naomi bowed her head in the presence of her mother, and offered a prayer and thanksgiving to the divine Saviour and friend of the fatherless and widow, who giveth to all who come to him, ": weary and heavy-laden, rest." She arose with an expres- sion of ineffable peace upon her countenance, having quaffed from those " waters which spring up into everlasting life."  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7355-00000121"/> 238        INTO THE LIGHT. "My daughter," said Mrs. Hammet, "I have expected that the Christian faith would take root in your soul ever since your father's happy departure to a world of light and joy, 'through Christ. I see clearly the plan of salvation, but I cannot yet apply --I cannot yet receive-- the wondrous doctrine of the triune Jehovah." "Yes, my dear mother," responded Naomi, 4" you see now ' as through a glass darkly; ' but the time will come when it shall be 'face to face. " CHAPTER XXXI.

ONE hour after the mother and daughter left the house of Moses Nathans, Joseph Fleming's elegant equipage drove up to the door, and, with a satisfied, self-assured manner, he demanded to see Miss Hammet. 1"She has left here," said the servant. "What do you say?" he impatiently questioned. "Where is Mrs. Nathans? I wish to see her. Tell her that a very ,particular friend of Miss Hammet is waiting below;" and he strode into the plain but neat parlor, and impatiently awaited her coming. The splendid carriage, the cream-colored horses, and a glimpse of the white kids of the stylish-looking coachman, put Mrs. loses in a flutter of expectation, and she made him wait while she exchanged her cap, and arranged, with math-   INTO THE LIGHT.         239' ematical precision, the folding of a small cashmere shawl, which she threw over her shoulders. He was pacing up and down the room as she entered, and, without any ceremony, immediately opened the object of his visit. "Madam," said he, " my cousin, Miss Hammet, arrived here this morning,- did she not?" "She did, sir," replied Mrs. Nathans, laconically, for she was offended at his peremptory manner. "I would like to have an interview with her on a subject of importance." "I regret that it will not be in my power, sir, to afford you that pleasure; for the young lady you mentioned and her mother left here for parts unknown an hour or two since:" "That is a very singular and unwarrantable proceeding. Have they taken their baggage?" "Yes, sir; all that belongs to them." "Which way did the carriage go? I must see them imme- diately. Did any one call for them?" "Yes, sir," she replied, with a little malice in her tone; "the coachman." Now secrecy had not been strictly enjoined upon Mrs. Nathans, but her ire was stirred by the overbearing manner of her visitor, and, through sheer perverseness, she would not give him any satisfaction. Chafed and fretted by disappointed hopes and frustrated plans, Joseph Fleming abruptly left the house, without even a civil good-morning. ' She is greatly mistaken," he mut- tered, " if she thinks to elude my vigilance. A fowler never laid a snare for a luckless bird with more care, cunning, and I hope success, than mine. I shall decoy and capture this haughty girl ere another month rolls round. Very soon necessity will impel her to exertion, and she will be seeking for another situation as governess. I bide my time! What I have sworn, I will perform.

"Drive faster, Sam," he cried, " to the Fifth Avenue Hotel. If the smiles of one fair one are denied me, I will avail myself of another's good graces. 'Vic,' you conceited beauty, you shall bask in my favor and play off, a short time, your coquettish airs for my amusement, and then I will toss you aside as a tired child does a toy. Heigh-ho! how every woman I meet seems tame and insipid compared with sweet Naomi Hammet! She might have made me a better man once! There was a time when I was true to my highest convictions of what was pure and good; but it is too late now. I sometimes think that an excess of gold is a curse to its possessor. But a truce to all such womanly softness! Sam, take the carriage home; I am done with you until even- ing." He sauntered leisurely up the steps, and sent his card to Miss Mixer by a servant. That young lady had been looking from the windows above- in glad anticipation of a ride, but felt disappointed when she saw Sam drive off, and the human appendage to a fine establishment - for he was noth- ing more to her--making his way into the hotel. He had not been near her for over a week, and she was uncer- tain how to receive him. Not sure enough of her power over him to show that she felt piqued and offended, she affected a childish pout as he entered the parlor, where she had gracefully disposed her slight, reed-like figure to the best advantage, half reclining upon a crimson lounge. A rich light-blue poplin dress fell in heavy folds about her person; ornaments of coral and gold suited well her brilliant com- plexion; flowing sleeves of the finest point lace partially con- cealed her beautifiully rounded arms; while in one jewelled hand she held a sandal-wood fan, --the Jew's first gift,- of exquisite Indian workmanship; the other, on which she leaned, was half buried in a shower of curls that were confined in a knot at the back of her head. Her foot rested   INTO THE LIGHT.         241 upon a velvet cushion, and displayed a tiny bronze slipper tastefully embroidered with gold thread and pearls. Her eyes were dropped as Fleming entered, and she appeared to be in a profound revery. He looked at her a moment ad- miringly, and then, in bland and honeyed accents, quoted,- "' A willowy grace Played in the movements of her form just moulded Into soft roundness, like a rose unfolded.'" And then, half in mock heroic, he said, "Let the light of tlhose resplendent orbs of thine shine upon me. Why do you thus persistently veil them from one who gropes in darkness, deprived of their liquid lustre?" "You have been well content it seems to walk in that darkness a long time," she replied. " It has been more than a week since your lordship has been visible, and I have refused invitations, almost every day, because I would not be absent when you came; but after this I shall not spend my time in weary waiting for one who does not care if I do make sacri- fices." He seated himself near her, and took the hand which held his gift. "Who stays I do not care?" he questioned. "Oh, if I might say all!" - Here he paused, and she was all expectation, waiting for those wished-for words that should declare his love; but they fell not from his lips; he had gone quite as far as he in- tended. The sparkle of the immense diamond, however, which he wore upon his finger, seemed to restore her good- humor, and she looked up archly at what seemed to be his embarrassment, and then a little silvery laugh rippled from her lips. "One cannot remain long vexed with you, monsieur," she said, " because, forsooth, you look so wretched when you are moody. Is that the word?" It did seem to be precisely the word to suit the dark, lowering visage that met her merry gaze; for Joseph Flem- 21  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7355-00000123"/> 242       INTO THE LIGHT. ing had sunk into a gloomy revery, and seemed insensible to every wile. She bit her lip with suppressed anger, and then rung the bell for refreshments. The servant brought in cake and wine. She knew that wine was sometimes used to lighten the heavy temperament of her saturnine admirer, and she was not sur- prised to see him awaken into something like animation as he attempted a compliment. "Like David before King Saul," he exclaimed, '" you can exorcise the shadows from my brow by such charming music as you alone can give;" and he led her to the piano, and she played those airs which he liked best, all the time despising him in her heart. Twenty times during the interview had she re- solved to put an end to their acquaintance, and rise superior to all mercenary hopes and aims; but then the vision of almost unbounded wealth at her command; the gratification of every capricious fancy, and, more than that, the triumph over those who now moved in a circle above her own, was too powerful a temptation to risist, and she grew deaf to the promptinogs of her better nature, and very graciously accepted an invita- tion to accompany him to the opera the following evening. When he left her there rose to her lips the exclamation of the preacher, "All is vanity." "I wonder," she murmured, "if, after all, there is any genuine love or happiness in this world; for there is always an unsatisfied yearning which follows every so-called enjoy- ment." Yes, votary of pleasure! there are fountains pure and free from which you have never quaffed, of which you have never dreamed, that satisfy the soul, and realize its immortal aspira tions.   INTO THE LIGHT.          243 CHAPTER XXXII. "We've all some desert garden Where life's first primrose died." "Along the slope of sunny bills A shadow rests alway; Some gentle heart sad music thrills To sorrow's lonely lay." MEANWHLE, Naomi and her mother were engaged in busy preparation for the approachinig marriage, aided by the ever- ready attention and exquisite taste of their warm friend and accomplished hostess. A simple wedding trousseau, adapted to the quiet and unassuminog class of people among wlhom her lot was soon to be cast, fully satisfied her fondest desires. Outward adornment had never been the grand desideratum of her well-regulated mind, and the whole color of her thought was how she could, in the future, best promote the happiness of him to whom she had given her heart, and be the means of increasing spirituality- as far as was possible  for a minister's wife - among the people of his charge. Let- ters came every other day from Horace Vincent, and their frank ingenuousness and affection, combined with a high in- tellectual tone, served to draw her still nearer the twin soul, which she had owned and recognized the first time they had ever met. Towards the close of Horace's last letter, he wrote, - "I am the prey of conflicting emotions when I witness the happiness of our pet Laura and Percy Bancroft. They take the most intense delight in each other's society; and now all restraints are -removed and their love is acknowledged  and  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7355-00000124"/> 244        INTO TEE LIGHT. approved, the free, wild carol of a bird never sounded sweeter than does her voice when it bursts forth in short snatches of song; while Percy never seems to tire of gazing upon a countenance that is changeful as an April day,- at one time lighted up with the merry sparkle of a child; at another displaying the sober, thoughtful expression of an intellectual woman. It is amusing, sometimes, to see the man of letters, the staid member of Congress, sittingl at her feet as a docile learner, acknowledging that her keen repartee and critical analysis have overthrown some of his fine-spun theories, and broucght about a revolution of senti- ment that would have taken years of study and controversy to accomplish. "He has greatly changed in relation to spiritual things. The ready sneer and implied doubt have been displaced by a reverence which threatens to reach the other extreme, and I have no longer any fears as to the influence he may exert over the young mind of Laura. He seems to feel the greatest reverence for Grace, and, by a very natural transi- tion, he believes in the religion which she so beautifully ex- emplifies. "1On the other hand, it is painful to see the gentle, patient, subdued manner of my sister Grace, which is the sad exterior of a heart that has been so early stricken and its fond hopes blighted; and yet there is a holy fire, an almost sublime ex- pression at times in her dark-blue eyes that tells me her self- renunciation, for the sake of another, is bringing its own just reward. She is still the devoted attendant upon our aged grandfather, and with her whom we call Aunt Hannah will remain in the old homestead when Laura leaves for her city home; for Percy is making rapid arrangements to have their marriage take place on the same day that consummates our approaching nuptials. Bancroft's house is to be furnished in a style very far beyond anything which my little sister ever dreamed of; and yet I think she will, young as she is, act her part gracefully and well. Bancroft's versatile nature A   INTO THE LIGHT.         245 and constant craving for chance may in the future mar their happiness, and he may grow weary even of one whose chlanrgefll beauty of expression constitutes, with him, her greatest charm. We shall part with our pet lamb with many hopes and fears. I know not which will be realized. "' Laura's affectionate nature is sorely tried at times, when she dwells for a moment upon her own happiness in contrast with that of her darling sister. One evening Percy had been detained in the city, and my sisters were sitting with me, be- neath the locust-tree which shades our dwelling, talking of Laura's future, that seemed to her so fair. The stars stole out, one by one, in the clear blue sky; faintly came the last notes of a robin in the eaves as he finished his evening song and sank to rest in his nest of down. The hum of the busy insect world was scarcely heard, and silence seemed to rest upon nature, until they, too, became silent. "Grace leaned against the tree, with that far-off look in her eyes that told of a yearning for' peace and rest beyond this earthly sphere. She looked so fair, so pure, so ethereal, in her white dress, that Laura, who had been reclining at her feet, idly picking the clover-leaves that grew near the rustic seat, gazed into her face with eyes that were blinded by tears. "' Dear Grace, can you, will you, ever forgive me?' she exclaimed, - "' Forgive you for what, my sister? I have nothing to forgive! ' "' For acting so unworthy a part,' replied Laura; 'for stealing-- although without intention-- into the heart that was yours, and shadowing your whole life. I can never for- give myself; that memory never leaves me, although I may seem sometimes so gay.' "Grace's voice was low and sweet, as she replied,- "' Believe me, Laura, when I tell you that I am daily more and more convinced that I should have been unhappy as the wife of Percy Bancroft. Your temperament suits him so much better Than a-quiet, even one like my own, that I have grown 21         .  s- z LrIt  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7355-00000125"/> 246        INTO THE LIGHT. to wonder how he first came to believe that he loved me. No, darling, let not the'thought that I am pininig for any happi- ness possessed by another sadden your bright hopes. It is true that disappointment cannot pass heavily over the heart, and not leave its impression there. Still, the discipline, no doubt, was a needful one, and should refine the dross of my nature.' "O Grace! I am so glad that you are not unhappy. I am so glad that I must cry!' and she laid her head in her sister's lap and sobbed quietly for a moment, and then spoke of their separation, saying, ' What shall I do, Grace, without you? Whenever I enjoy anything, my first thought is to tell Grace; if I have a beautiful flower given me, the first idea is to delight you with it; if I see a fine paintinting, I want you to share my enjoyment, 4and I try to remember every point, so that you may see, too, with memory's eyes. That is why Percy calls some of my descriptions, word-paintings.' "'Oh, I never shall talk to him, brother Horace,' she said, turning to me, ' with such entire freedom, as I do to you! And then, too, I shall be in a mneasure, alone, in a strange city. If Percy were only a little younger, it would be more easy.' "' You will fall into the daily round of duties far more easily than you think,' said Grace. ' Woman has an adaptive nature that soon fits her for almost any position. Aunt Hannah will be there to receive you when you return from your journey, and will remain a week after with the servants, until you begin to realize that you are indeed mistress of a household.' "' But you and Horace must visit me every week, will you not? If Percy and I could travel all the time, it would not seem quite so formidable; but I shrink from cares and duties concerning which I. have only a superficial knowledge.' "But over the future dim shadows recline; Heart, be thou hopeful; the present is thine.'   INTO THE LIGHT.         247 "Smiles chased away the tears that a moment before were ready to flow, and the next remark made by Grace turned her thoughts into a different channel, while I watched the changeful play of feeling in my sisters with intense interest. "I Mr. Bancroft says that he expects to spend the winter in Florence; therefore, darling, you will have enough of change and sight-seeing to content you, I have no doubt; but, amid all the beauty of Italian scenery, forget not the rural loveli- ness that is spread around our native hills, and remember the loved of sweet home.' "They arose to their feet, with their arms around each other, and looked forth upon that balmy eve with an earnest gaze that must have imprinted the landscape, with every familiar object upon the memory, forming a picture that would hang on its walls long after other and brighter scenes had faded. I write of this because I know that you will re- joice that the sisterly relation between them is still, unbroken. "Our future home, dearest, seemed almost transfigured, as I beheld it last evening, bathed in the light of the setting sun, whose golden beams mingled with the cool shadows of the tall trees that stretched their arms protectingly over it, as if invoking an evening benediction. "I sat down beneath the latticed porch that is covered with rose vines, rich with summer's daintiest blooms, and thought of that first moss-rose which I plucked and gave you when our love was yet unacknowledged, and which called forth a blush upon your cheek that rivalled the glowing tints of the flower you held in your hand, and gave me a hope that permeated my whole nature with a tender joy. "I gazed upon the shifting light and shade that passed over the distant woods, and rich green meadows that lay un. rolled in fertile beauty below, and thought perhaps life's shadows might come and go with us as lightly, leaving no trace behind.

Yes, thou art mine I My heart thy home; henceforth shall flow Its fondest, purest hopes for thee; And thou, by love enshrined, shalt know How full of joy this life can be. CALDWELL. THE good   doctor was brimming over with delight as the time drew near that should bring the fulfilment of his long cherished hopes respecting his protegee. Plans were laid that himself and wife should spend a   week ,at the parsonaoe be- fore the expiration of the summer, and that they should be present at the wedding, the doctor giving her away. There was much private conversation between Horace and the doctor shortly after he arrived; and, after spending an hour in Naomi's society, the two went out together, appar- ently upon urgent business.  Whatever it was, however, did not transpire until some time afterward; but a  pleasant surprise of some kind she knew awaited her. She had been the recipient of so much kindness lately that her heart   was very tender, and her eyes grew humid as she remembered the goodness of the Lord in the days of her pilgrimage. Horace and the doctor had accomplished their mission and were returning, when they came suddenly upon Mr. Arm- strong, who accosted the doctor politely, and was then intro- duced to his companion, the Rev. Mr. Vincent.   Mr. Armstrong had heard of him through his wife, who had spoken of him in a way that created an unfavorable impres- sion, and he was not prepared to see so handsome and high- bred a gentleman. Dr. Heber spoke to him, aside, saying that he would communicate a little matter, which, for certain reasons, he wished him to keep secret for the present; and then told him of the approaching marriage of Miss Hammet with the gentleman whose acquaintance he had just made, at the same time alluding to the unjust aspersions which had been cast upon her character, which would soon be put al- together aside by the good and honorable man who had chosen her as a companion for life. Mr. Armstrong was greatly pleased, for the fair Jewess had always commanded his respect, and he reluctantly permitted himself to believe aught against her. He thought of Gazelle's delight at being permitted to see -her teacher once more, and said that he should impatiently await the doctor's permission to communi- cate the tidings to his wife and family. They parted with a favorable impression on both sides. How Naomi's heart warmed towards her faithful friend as she sat looking out of the window and saw him ascend the steps arm in arm with the choice of her heart! Horace bowed and kissed his hand, and the doctor did the same, only with so much greater impressement, that it called up the dimpled smiles he so much liked to see, and caused her to exclaim that the doctor possessed all the courtly grace that once belonged to Sir Charles Grandison. "Yes," replied Mrs. Heber, smiling; " he does not put on his politeness in society and take it off in private; he has the rare virtue of being consistent at all times, and, although  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7355-00000127"/> 250        INTO THE LIGHT. his present accession of manners is intended to be extrava- gant, yet politeness is as natural as the breath he draws. This characteristic, however, does not prevent him from being sometimes feared for his keen, cutting expressions of contempt for that which he considers mean and wrong. If one of our nation pleads extreme poverty, as they frequently do in order to drive a bargain, I have known him stop when he has heard it and say a few words in a low tone that would send the blood into the face, straighten the stooping figure, and bring back a sense of manhood and self-respect that would entirely alter the whole aspect." "He doubtless dearly loves our nation still," replied Naomi; " and, although the glory has departed from Israel, yet they are not insensible to regenerating influences, and the doctor in that quiet way may perform a missionary work of great value My father will rejoice through all ages that he learned of the Messiah through his instrumentality. I confidently look forward to the restoration of our Hebrew brethren to a place among the nations of the earth, and believe, too, that the time is not very far distant." "Most true," said the doctor, as he entered and caught the last words. "We have quoted in one of the Jewish les- son-books these words; 'And I will get them praise and fame in every nation where they have been put to shame.' " "How rich are the promises to that once honored but now fallen race!" said Horace. "I rejoice greatly that I am to be so nearly allied to one who came of so lofty a lineage ; for was not the King of Zion a Jew? And from converted Jews alone came the words of holy writ that make wise unto salvation." "And I am glad, too, Naomi," said the doctor, " that your love for the Hebrew race has not decreased since the eyes of your soul were opened to behold- the wondrous things of the true Jewish law. "I do dearly love the children of Israel let them be ever so poor and degraded, for the royal blood that flows in their   INTO THE LIGHT.         251 veins is precious also in the eyes of the Son of David, the divine restorer of Israel's glory." Electric-like from heart to heart flowed these words of hope and trust, bringing them all together in a nearer and dearer relation; and the doctor felt that his protegee had found indeed a man after his own heart. He noticed the look of confidence and love that passed between them as Horace spoke, and felt that her earthly happiness was secure in the keeping of so noble a specimen of manhood as the Rev. Horace Vincent. His artistic eye noted the grand poise of the large and well-shaped head, the broad and open brow, the dark-brown wavy hair, the large, liquid eyes, and the sweet, almost feminine, expression of the finely curved mouth, as Horace looked down upon Naomi's work and watched her loop the silver needle through the snowy worsted strands that lay in her lap, and thought that, Gentile though he were, he was worthy to wear the Jewish rose in his bosom. Herace's treatment of Mrs. Hammet was at once tender and filial, and her heart rejoiced over the son of her adoption. A few hours later they had taken leave of their kind friends with every expression of gratitude and regard, and Naomi, as they rode along, dould not help contrasting her present ride to Briarwood Hall with her former one, when she was going among strangers friendless, almost, and alone. Now, the month of roses will scarcely have passed before she will doubtless become a happy bride. She lifted her eyes to meet Horace's gaze of tender admiration, saw her mother's look of sweet content, and then the long lashes drooped and be- came heavy with unshed tears. Horace's arm stole gently around her waist and he drew her still nearer his heart, as he murmured, - "My beloved! my rose! will never, I trust, regret being transplanted into a more congenial soil, where the sunshine of love shall cause it to blossom into still more perfect beauty." As they drove up the avenue leading to Briarwood Hall, a  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7355-00000128"/> 252        INTO THE  LIGHT. delighted group stood upon the high stone steps beneath the ample portico, waiting to give them welcome. Grace Vin- cent stood leaning against one of the stone pillars, clad in simple white muslin, with a small crimson scarf thrown over her shoulders, wearing a large straw flat to protect her from the sun, gazing pensively at Laura, who was seated at her feet, busily engaged in forming a wreath out of some flowers which Percy had thrown into her lap, and which she declared must be put around Grace's straw hat. 1"I think the wreath would better become your saucy self," said Grace, good-humoredly, "although that little hat by your side looks more as if waiting for a feather than any sylvan decoration." '"Laura does not need any ornament, does she, Miss Vin- cent?" said Julia Carrington ; " that lawn dress is the sweet- est blue I ever saw, and suits so well her fair complexion. By the way, I ought to be more careful of my ovn, for the sun is getting warm; " and she drew from the pocket of her bright plaid silk dress a richly embroidered handkerchief, and threw it over her head, a la Marie Stuart. Her dark hair was rollecl back from her face, displaying the finely arched eyebrows and low but broad brow to advantage, while her eyes beamed with an honest admiration for Laura, which made her look -almost handsome as she stood shading her eyes with her hand, watching the approach of the carriage that contained the expected visitors. Mrs. Goodrich appeared at the open door looking very neat and matronly, with a lilac-colored morning dress on, bor- dered with a deep and tasteful trimming, whose colors har- monized beautifully with the rose-colored ribbons of her dressy little breakfast-cap. Mr. Carrinaton and Percy Ban- croft stood arm in arm as they came near, and Percy raised his broad Panama and waved it in merry greeting. Mr. Carrington was the first to reach the carriage door, with some little curiosity to behold theold lady whom Naomi called mother. To his surprise he handed out a lady appar-   INTO THE LIGHT.         253 ently in the prime of life, whose elegant and graceful bear- in( made him stare for a moment in extreme astonishment. M'liy mother, my dear friend, Mr. Carrington," said Naomi, who saw his surprise, and evidently enjoyed it. "I hope, my dear sir, that you will extend the same friendship to the mother as you have given to her daughter when she most required it." Mr. Carrington, recovering almost instantly from his em- barrassment, grew talkative, and even brilliant, under the influence of the matured charms and intellectual conversa- tion of Mrs. Hammet. "Do look at papa," said Julia an hour later; 1"I think he looks ten years younger than he did this morning. It must be your presence, Miss Hammet, which inspires him." The whole party were delighted with Mrs. Hammet, who was surprised into unusual animatipon and vivacity by the combination of pleasant circumstances which met them on every side. Mrs. Goodrich felt that she had met a mind congenial to her own, and that she could love her very dearly. There was a certain softness and gentleness pervading ther whole demeanor, which, she herself did not possess and which she admired all the more in consequence. 'Miss Vincent," said Naomi, affectionately, to Grace, "L how very kind it was in you to come here to meet us!" "Call me Grace," she replied, quickly. "Grace, dear Grace! if you only knew how much I have loved and admired you, you would accept my heart's true and tender sympathy and affection. I, too, have known grief and many disappointments, and can appreciate, more fully than you know, your great sacrifice, your generous abnegation of self." Grace drew her arm around Naomi's waist without reply, for her heart was won, and from that time they were sisters indeed. 22  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7355-00000129"/> 254        INTO THE LIGmT. CHAPTER XXXIV. "I slept, and dreamed that life was beauty I I woke, and found that life was duty. Was then my dream a treacherous lie? Toil on, sad soul, courageously, And thou shalt find thy dream to be A noonday light and truth to thee! THE news of the minister's engagement and approaching marriage had circulated freely in the town of L--  several weeks previous, and the residents seemed to vie with each other in striving to make the " minister's home" as attrac- tive as possible. It was a common cause, in which all were pleasantly interested, and therefore they were inclined to view with favor those who had been the means of so much pleasant excitement. Yet there was an undercurrent of feeling that had been kept in agitation by Miss Polly Perkins and one or two others, who thought the minister little better than a heathen for wishing to marry a Jewess, - even if she was a Christian, - which offered some slight opposition to the easy and harmo- nious action of the society. An album bedquilt, which had been commenced when he first came among them, seemed to linger along not more than half finished. Polly was the prime mover in starting it, and to her were due the obstacles that seemed to fall in the way of its completion. Still, most of the parish entered inito the task of preparing the pastor's home with a hearty zeal, which was only slightly abated by the bits of scandal which came up from time to time no one knew how. The Ladies' Circle connected with the society had been held several times since Horace took charge of the parish,   INTO THE LIGHT.         255 and he had passed through each session with success, leaving them very well satisfied with his urbanity, dignity, and iim- partial bestowment of his notice upon all. The president of the society thought he might have lingered a little longer at her table, but still there was an implied compliment in the remark that it took considerable ability to arrange systemat- ically all those bundles, and distribute them aright among so many industrious ladies; and she felt quite assured in her own mind that he thought no one could do it better than her- self. Two days after Naomi and her mother arrived, the fourth sewing circle was held at Mrs. Green's, and, as it was known that Mr. Carrington had visitors, it was expected that they would be present. Those who felt interested surmised pretty accurately who those visitors were, and there was an extra amount of dressing for the occasion. Mrs. Green thought seriously of preparing some ice creams for the evening; but such an innovation was opposed by some, who thought it would lead to too much display and expense, and the money had better lbe devoted to the purchase of white cotton for the poor. But the cotton' was never bought, and the economical proposition failed of its intended fruit. Nimble fingers and busy tongues were doing their best, when one of the members came in with the news that the- minister's intended would not be present, - Grace Vincent had told her so,-and there was much disappointment expressed among those who felt inclined to criticise and lost the opportunity. Still, Polly Perkins had quite enough to do that evening in actively stirring up the disaffected members. Mrs. Green felt hurt and disappointed that Miss Hammet did not come, as it was her house, and it was a personal slight, and she declared that after they were married she reckoned it would be a long time before she called upon them. Mrs. Somers said that "4 she feared that it would be a dis- advantage to the society, introducing a foreign element  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7355-00000130"/> 256       INTO TIE LIGHT. among them. The state of religion was quite low enough now. Well, she hoped it would be for the best." ("But, mamma," said Belle, " she is a Christian, I know from good authority, and I am prepared to love her because I love the Jewish nation, - of which she is a beautiful rep- resentative, - and have loved them ever since I read Grace Aguillar's ' Women of Israel.' " "Oh, yes!" cried several young girls, who had been stand- ing in a group in one corner of the long parlor, winding skeins of cotton;" lhow nice it will be to look at her and thihk of Miriam, Esther, and Ruth!" "It is my opinion," said the tallest of the group, " that we shall be quite fond of her. And then, too, if she woull only take a Bible class she could explain so nicely many of the Jewish symbols, and show us how they may apply to Chris- tianity." "Well, I do not know what the age is coming to," said Polly, " when young ladies uphold such out-of-the-way do- ings, and ministers think they can marry anything and any- body without consulting the society." "( Or, in other words, Miss Polly, without consulting you," replied a fine-looking old lady, who sat up very straight, knitting, and who had been listening to both sides with attention. She was the eldest deacon's wife, and felt called upon to give her testimony, as she always did, in tones loud enough to be heard all over the room, whenever she saw a disposition to scandal. "They do say that she was turned away from the house where she had been governess, because she was not a proper person to have charge of the children," said another, who had taken her cue from Polly. 1"They say she had a beau, or something of the kind, before she was engaged to Mr. Vincent." "Ladies," again interrupted the deacon's wife, "I have a word to say, and you will pardon me if I am wrong in my views. I have been many years in this society, and am   INTO THE LIGHT.         257 happy to say that we have met together once a month, for useful purposes, without having the reputation of a scandal- loving society, - a name that too often attaches itself to such kind of gatherings. To-day, however, I find that some have thoughtlessly made remarks which they would not be willing, I am sure, to make in the presence of our good minister, - remarks which, I am convinced, have no foundation. And I wish to say to all that I have undoubted testimony from a very influential family in New York, who know the lovely lady well whom Mr. Vincent has selected, that she is a supe- rior woman, a truly beautiful and pure character in every respect." She turned to Miss Polly with a pleasant smile, and said,- ( I am sorry to hear one of our most useful members lend her voice and her influence to anything that would produce discord and distrust in our usually harmonious circle. I be- lieve it was not purposely but thoughtlessly done, however." Polly's conscience felt an uncomfortable twinge, but the kind reproof was complacently received, for had she not been called one of the most useful members? But her heart re- proached her as she thought how much mischief she had really and viciously tried to make for one who had never done her any harm but that of winning a heart she had scarcely the shadow of a hope of appropriating to herself. Mrs. L---, the senior deacon's wife, was a highly edu- cated, cultivated lady and a consistent Christian character. Therefore her opinion and sentiments had great weight in the parish, and the tide of feeling, which was rapidly taking a wrong direction, turned at once - after the frank and firm avowal of her convictions--with renewed favor towards the minister, who just then entered with his sister Grace, and felt his heart cheered by the many expressions of good will heard upon all sides. Polly's stock was decidedly below par, and she edged her chair a little way out of sight into a recess, and took out her knitting. The green velvet bag closed with an emphatic 22*  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7355-00000131"/> 258        INTO THE LIGHT. snap, and the maiden's lips also grew compressed with the thought that she would bide her time till all should see that she was not mistaken. Close by Mrs. Lee's side sat Grace Vincent, enjoying the conversation of the dear old lady who was so great a favor- ite with all, and to whom she always made her way immedi- ately on entering a room where she was, by the force of a strong impulse, the attraction of a kindred nature. Polly could not help being a listener, although she seemed altogether engrossed with her knitting, the rapid click of the needles keeping time to some uncomfortable reflections, as she bent her head over her work. "Why, Grace, darling," said the venerable woman, "you need not look so sober when I speak of my fourscore years; should I pass away a little while before, I shall fold your beautiful affection to my heart and take it with me, with all the sweet memories connected with it. "The life eternal in the far beyond appears at times very near, and I rejoice in the thought of an endless being, un- touched by age, by sin, or sorrow, and it gives me pleasure to feel that, - "' I nightly pitch my moving tent a day's march nearer home.'  "Yes, it is a delightful and consoling thought," re- plied Grace, "that in one sense we never die. Man and ,woman, viewed from this point, cease to be mere atoms, as it were, of the universe, and rise in untold dignity and power." "Very true," resumed the old lady; " and in this connec- tion friend and foe alike become of more importance. Hu- manity in its very lowest grade seems well worthy the sacVi- fice of a mortal life, if by so doing the true life of another can be secured." "Only think, for a moment," said Grace, " how even one great thought cast forth from the mind, one good deed done,   INTO THE LIGHT.         259 may meet us thousands of years hence bearing immortal fruit." "And then, again," replied Mrs. Lee, " think of the re- morse, the ceaseless unrest, which must fill the soul, when the immense amount of mischief sometimes caused by a thoughtless and sinful tongue stands fully revealed in the light of the eternal world. We shall be judged, I believe, according to the intention, the purpose of the heart, whether it be good or bad." "Ah, yes," said Grace, while her eyes beamed with a sad, serene light, which told of conflicts endured and victory won. "I think every earnest effort made, every disappointed hope for others' good, will be seen written hereafter upon the scroll of being as if fulfilled, and in this way we catch glimpses of the glory and the joy that will henceforth en- sphere our being. "'Life hath but shadows were no promise given To light the future with its fadeless ray."' "Yes, dear child!" exclaimed her companion, " these are solemn thoughts, and, although not new, yet the same idea, differently expressed, often opens an avenue through which light streams and illuminates some hitherto shaded recess of the soul, and then thought's radiant pathway connects the unseen world with this, and the angels pass to and fro with messages of love and peace and joy to the weary, sorrowing children of earth." Polly Perkins gazed upon the two with mingled feelings of regret and admiration, as she felt overwhelmed by a glance at her own moral nature, called forth by one thought ex- pressed by the venerable woman, who was indeed a mother in Israel, and whose wise and tender counsel had years be- fore led Polly to resolve that she would try to live a truly Christian life. The old lady was still beautiful. Tall in stature, with an erect and graceful carriage, she seemed younger than she  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7355-00000132"/> 260        INTO THE LIGHT, really was; her cap was white, of the most transparent texture; her silver-gray hair was disposed on each side in three or four soft curls, which shaded an oval face that must have been eminently beautiful in her youth. When she smiled, her pleasant gray eyes half closed with a sort of cov- ert merriment which made her humor, when she chose to exert it, irresistible. They were eyes, too, that expressed a depth of feeling and sympathy for all that craved it, that made the senior deacon's wife so universally beloved. Grace had seated herself upon a hassock at her feet, and, as they talked, her blue eyes were necessarily cast upward, giving an elevated, spiritual expression to her face that har- monized well with the light dress of flowing muslin that swept around her in graceful folds, devoid of the elaborate trimming so much in fashion at the present day. Unconsciously they presented a beautiful picture of blooming youth and lovely, happy old age. Miss Polly was so engrossed ,with her uncomfortable thoughts that she dropped a stitch in her knitting, at the same time that she dropped her ball of yarn. Grace sprang from her low seat, secured the ball, and handed it to her with a cordial smile, at the same time saying, "Let me adjust your knitting for you, Miss Perkins; the light is rather dim where you are sitting." And she took the sock out of her hand, dexterously cast off the stitches, and returned it to her again in good order. Polly's iciness melted under the influence of that genial smile, and she thought to herself that, after all, she was feel- ing much happier than when she was indulging bitter feelings towards the brother of the fair girl before her, and she thanked her with a litle nod of the head that was a token of one of her most gracious moods, and offered her the little chair on which she was sitting. The residents of L---  kept early hours; and, therefore, when the seminary bell rang for nine o'clock, the Rev. Horace Vincent offered a short prayer and closed the meeting.   INTO THE LIGHT.         261 Deacon Lee and his wife were going home in the same direction as Miss Polly, and the old lady seized the occasion to sow some good seed by the way, which in time took root and bore fruit in the heart of the spinster. The venerable couple were an ornament to any society; and fortunate indeed was the new minister to have two such stately pillars uphold the little church, that had else been disintegrated and scattered to the four winds long since by inharmonious action. Mrs. Lee, in alluding to her advanced age, often said that not many more years would be likely to be hers, and she wished constantly to realize the highest kind of enjoyment--that of doing good and making others happy --while she did live. She therefore felt prepared to love the minister's choice, and resolved to help her to the best of her ability in the new and not very enviable field she would soon occupy. A pastor's wife does not rest on a pillow of roses, as many a gentle, refined, and sorely tried woman can testify, and she knew the young creature would need encouragement and support. She awakened her tenderest interest, too, from the fact of her being a descendant of that race to whom we owe so much, and whose very existence seems at times ignored by the relig- ious world. Mingled with this interest was a hope that Naomi's mother might step forth from the thraldom of the Jewish law into the liberty of the new revelation. She felt assured that Mr. Vincent's preaching was of that character which would eventually unite the three in one perfect bond; and, in order to prepare the way for a favorable reception of her among the people, she had met some discontented, carp- ing remarks, "' that the minister would have more than a wife to support out of his salary," by the information she had gained through Mrs. Heber, that Naomi's mother had a trifle sufficient from her grandfather's legacy that would prevent her being dependent upon them.

'How many hearts in the future were made happy by the wise forethought and delicate perception of what was needed in the society, displayed by this venerable and good woman, who truly loved her neighbor as herself! CHAPTER XXXV. "His love hath saved me I Oh, for words to tell it I My sin is gone I - ye angels help me sing I To this my theme attune your harps, and swell it, Till through the heavens the anthem-peal shall ring." IT was about a week after the sewing-circle when Julia Carrington came into the room where Naomi was sitting with Mrs. Goodrich, and exclaimed, ' If I were not afraid I should spoil my roses by catching a contagious fever, I would really go and watch with that poor woman!" "Whom do you mean, my dear?" inquired her aunt. "Why, 'lemonade' Polly Perkins, to be sure. Poor thing, she was taken very sick quite suddenly, and they say that people are not as ready to watch with her as they should be. She helped Mrs. Brooks nurse her two children, who were sick, and when they were getting better she found that she had taken the fever herself." "She is a  good creature at times," said Mrs. Goodrich turning towards Naomi, "and then again she will be acid enough to merit the sobriquet bestowed upon her by those who notice her contradictory character. She ought not to be neglected, for she is almost always ready to lend a helping hand where there is sickness." "I will watch with her to-night, with pleasure," replied Naomi. "I   never have the least fear of contagion, and Dr. Heber says that is a guaranty against it." "No, indeed, you must not," said Julia. "Only think, if you should take the fever, what would Mr. Vincent say?"   INTO THE LIGHT.         263 "That I had been doing mny duty," replied Naomi,. smiling at her earnestness. "I only should do by her precisely as I would like to have another do by me if I were sick and lone- ly. I remember her well; 'she is not an attractive person, andC therefore needs all the more that some effort should be made on her behalf." Naomi quietly set aside all opposition made to the plan by her mother and Mrs. Goodrich, and when Horace came that eveling he found her equipped as if for a walk. In a few words she told him of her purpose, and, although his brown eyes had a sober expression in them, yet he offered no ob- jection, feeling that she would indeed be a ministering angel among the people of his clare. Horace took her hand and placed it within his arm, with that glad sense of ownership which often fills the minds of betrothed lovers when apart from other companionship, feel- ing that they were fully united in their views respectingl duty, -that duty which one immortal owes to another in need, when met along the pathway of life. He gazed upon thle sweet, serious face beside him with a pure delight, as he mentally asked himself the question,- "Can it be possible that I alone :1am the well-beloved of this fair girl? - fair in every sense of the word, not onlly out- wardly, but the belautiful svymmetrical spirit within answers to my ideal of all that is pure and lovely in woman." Yet, amid his great happiness, there arose a fear that s lhe would become to'him an earthly idol, and his earnest, ardent nature found utterance in impassioned words. "r Naomi, darling! is there not danger that I shall worship at thy shrine instoad of Heaven's? The homage of my soul seems akin to idolatry, and yet, with the eyes of my spirit, I think I look far beyond all this joy, and bless the divine Source firom whence it is derived." The clear eyes were lifted to his face with a look so calm, so trusting, so full of hope in the future, that peace, incffa-  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7355-00000134"/> 264          INTO TrHE LIGHT. ble peace, seemed to rest upon them in benediction, fillingo their hearts with a sweet content. Horace spoke argain, but more calmly, and d(ispassionately. "Sorrow, time, and change may assail us, but yet, if true to each other, dearest, we shall know. many golden days amid life's shadows. Did you think me quite so much of an enthusiast, Naomi?" The question brought the smile to her lip that hle so tmuch loved to see, and she replied with her usual franknles, - "I knew that your character possessed quite enoutgh of that clement when I saw the kindling eye and rapt expres- sion of your face the first time I ever heard you preach. When you commenced I feared that I should be disappoinlted, but the apparent lack of earnestness at first I soon found wars simply the repose of conscious strengthll. Ah, es! you are an enthusiast, Horace, - too much so in some things; " and the rose deepened on her cheek, as she continued, "Let us be earnest workers, not dreamers ; tJlen our brightest hopes of life will be nobly fulfilled." Some moments passed before either again spoke. It was happiness enoulgh to be in each other's presence ; heart spoke to heart, and the audible interchange of thought was scarcely needed. "Do you know   the sick woman with whom  you are to watch to-night?" at length Horace said. "Oh, yes; quite a peculiar person, is she not?" "I think," replied IIorace, " that the groundwork of her character is good; but the exercise of the nmore tender emo- tions, the affections, has been denied her, and she goes about trying to do good with a severe formality and occasional bit- terness that is simply the outgrowth of an isolated life, where that life is not permeated by the lighlt and beauty of true piety." "You awaken my pity for her," rejoined Naomi, " and I feel to-night somewhat as might the possessor of untold wealth, - ready and willing to bestow largely a portion where   INTO THE LIGHT.         2 65 needed ; - and so I think I could love even Miss Polly, for the reason that she does not readily elicit real affection." O love! divine alchemist! we bow to thy transforming power, which casts a lalo of brightness and beauty over the holeliest objects, and invests with myriadl charms the mlind and character of the beloved one!' They parted at the door of Polly's home, and as Naomi entered she mlet the mother of little Agnes Ray, who had, from a feeling of gratitude for past favors, been in every day during her sickness a little while to wait upon her. "O iart !" she exclaimed, as soon as  she saw Naomi, "I am so glad you have come, for the poor body is powerful bad to-nilght. Slhe seems to be flighty, and talks so fast that my head pains me righlt ol the top of it after lhearing of her. I was just thinking what I should do, as I must leave her to go home to the children." "Has the doctor been to-day?" inquired Niraomi. "Yes, this afternoon, and left some written directions, which you will find, miss, under a bottle onl the table. I will be here in the morning as early as I can. lMiss Grace Vin- cent has engaged me to come a part of every day." "Stay a moment," interrupted Naomi, " until I look at the paper you mentioned; " and she entered the little room where Polly lay in all the restlessness of a bTlrnin-g fever, saw that the prescription was a cooling, composing draught, and immediately despatched Mrs. Ray for it. In the mean while she busied herself in giving an air of colfort to the Iapartment, which had bcen straighteled out, as Mrs. Ray expressed it, atter her own fashion, which was none of the neatest.  Order was out of the question in her arrange- mcents; for she said " she always liked to have things all around her, then she knew just where to find them." The table, on which stood several bottles of medicine, was drawn out iii the mifdlce of the room; the chairs had been moved from their places whenever she wished to lay anything down; the bureau drawers were all open; and the pictured board, 23  &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7355-00000135"/> 266        INTO THE LIGHT. which usually filled the fireplace, had been taken down in order to warm some water, and the ashes were strewn about the hearth, giving the whole room a cheerless aspect. Miss Polly, who was, when well, anno!ed at any disorder, felt disturbed and uncomfortable, she klMe  not why, al- though " not herself at all, at all," as Mrs. Ray remnarkeld. Naomi smoothed the bed-coverling, raised the head of the sick woman, turned her fever-heated pillow, and gave her a teaspoonful of the cooling( drallught. She moaned faintly, ' I must, I will, go in the woods among the pines, and lie down in the cool moss, close by the little stceam that flows be- neath the willows; " and she half arose on one arm, gazing wildly at Naomi, who pressed her back gently, and passed her fingers lightly over her brow, until she yieldedl to the soothing influence, and fell into a refreshingo slumber. Naomi went to the door and looked out upon the eveninw sky, bright with the crescent moon that lmnngr low il th! western heavens, and inhale(d the odorous breath of the pineH?, which came from the wood beyond the t-imeadow, with a f6el- ing of gratituclde for health and life, which led her to think still more kindly of the sufferer within. Tlhe tinkle of a cow-bell was heard in the distance, and a boy was soon seen driving   several fine-looking animals towards home, whistling for their entertainment and his owtn. Naomi recofgnized him as beloDnging to Mr. Carrington. "Patrick," she cried, please get 1me one or two of those pine boughs yonder, will you?" Certainly, miss," he replied, while he pulled his cap with an awkward attempt at a bow, an(d with a bound lie cleared the fence, eager to do her bidding, and returnerl in a momnnt with the evergreen branches, moist with the dew and laden with friagrrmace. Naomi swept up the ashes on the desolate-looking hearth, and filled the fireplace with the cool, green foliage, so re- freshing to the eye and sense. And thus she answered, as far as possible, her patient's longing cry for the woods, and,   INTO THE LIGHT.        267 taking a book, read until near morning quietly, when Polly awoke and asked for water in quite a rational tone of voice. As she was drinking, she gazed upon her young nurse with quite a puzzled expression. "I amn here," said Niaomi, simply, " to nurse you and help you to get well. Your fever has abated, - has turned, I think, and I believe you will recover. Let me sponnge your face and arms in cool water, and that will refiesh you." As she ceased speaking, Polly recognized the minister's betrothed, and with a sigh she murmured, "You are too kind; I do not deserve it." Yet she sulobmitted passively while Naomi bathed her face so gently and tenderly that the l heart of the little woman melted within her, and the first use she made of her returning reason was to vow melntnlly that she would be her fast friend for life. All enmity, all foolish pride, left her, and she blest the sweet girl in her heart as she asked her why she camel to nurse her, and how she knew that she was alone in her illness. "I heard you were sick and suffering," replied Naomi, "and also that you had perhaps taken your fever in conse- quence of your care of others who  Cere sick. Was not that a sufficient inducement?" Polly did not speak arain for some minutes, but lay quietly pondering upon her words. "I have so longed for the woods," at lenlgth she said, "and I have had such a delightful dream!  It alnost seemed real." As she spoke she glanced around ther little apartment, and directly the outward harmony met her most sensitive want, and that order which was her second nature gave her a feel- ing of calmness and rest, which equalized her nervous sys- tem and assisted the recruiting forces of nature in their work quite as much as the doctor had done in his. Presently she noticed the piny odor which pervaded the room, saw the fiesh, verdant branches that filled and con- cealed the unsightly fireplace, on which her eyes had rested *  &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7355-00000136"/> 268        INTO THE LIGHT. so many weary ddays, and, drawing a long breath of satisfac- tion, she exclaimed with all her characteristic earnestness, - "Who was so thoughtful, so good? May I have a branch of those cool leaves to hold in my hand? O Miss Hammet! how I craved in my sickness a sight of the pines, and never expected to behold them again!" "1 know you did," replied Naomi. "That seemed to be the one idea which you Ikept repeating, and as soon as I brouylght themn in you seemned to apprehend it, although youl did not know what contented you, and shortly after fell asleep. Now that will do for the present, AMiss Perkins; you must not talk any more, but mnust try and sleep again." Polly put her hand over her eyes and came as near shed- ding tears as was possible for her peculiar temperament, which was unaccustomed to such weakness, as she thought,- "No one ever consulted my wishes in that way before. No one ever cared whether I longed for anything or not. Suppose I did, I imust get it myself. Anything will do for Miss Polly! And here this dear girl has sat by me all light, watching. If I ever get well I will try and atone for all I have said and clone against her and the one she loves." Polly felt that her head was clear, but that physically she was very weak, and gathering together, as it were, the forces of memory, she cllened and calle a charged upon her ilnner and real self with a searching scrutiny that admitted of no escape; saw, as in the light of a new revelation, her past life, in its true complexion, and turned f'rom the retrospect with a, sighl of humility and .repentance. She was too thoroughly in earnest to sleep just then. Naomi heard the weary sigh, and taking up a fan, which lay upon the window-seat, commenced fanning her patient, who looked into her face with a subdued and even tender ex- pression. "Miss Hammet," she saidC I have heard of conviction of sin, and conversion to a new and better life. I am sure I have talked enough about it, - as wisely as if I knew by personal   INTO THE LIGHT.         269 experience. Many thought I did; but it was only 'sounding brass and tinkling cymbal.' Now I am sure I feel myself a sinner as I never felt l;efore. What does it mean?" Like a flash of light came to her the thought, "The Divine Spirit is surely ; leadinog me into a way which I have not known,'- the new and living way which leads to Christ." And with the faint rays of this new hope shillning athwart her soul, she continued, - "I have been very sick, haye I not? Does the Lord mean to spare this fruitless figc-tree a little longer? r has the word gone forth, ' Cut it down ; whly cumbereth it the ground?' " Naomi felt that the IIoly Spirit's qiickening pow er, with its relenerating influences, was movinfg over the heart which thus lay unfolded before her, and, lifting up a short prayer for- help to guide the seeking, askinl'g soul arilght, she told her, with great simplicity and earnestness, of her own experience, --of her sense of sin, her long unbelief, and the final triumph of her faith in a risen Radeemer, who is ready to re- ceive all who come to him in sincerity and truth; tlat Christ looks with infinite compassion upon the greatest sin- ner, and that then and therle he was ready to receive her without any more prcparation. Polly gazed upon Naomli's face as upon that of a minister- ing angfel, as she slowly repeated her words. "What! 'just as I am,' Miss Hanmlet, without trying for ears to be more worthy, more righlteous?" "His grace is sufficient for all, withotut the aid of anythin g that man cran do," replied Naomi, gently. "Think 'or a moment how even the best efforts of earthl's children would mar the glory and beauty, the fulness of redeeming love." O"    she cried, "I see it! I see it I Miss Hammet, I must go to Him, put my hand in his with the trust of a little child, just as I am, without waiting to be better,--without bringing my good works as the price of my redemption.

"I'll drop my burden at His feet, And bear a song away." ) In the midst of this neo-found peace, and these repentant resolutions, the sick woman fell asleep again, and Naomli, feeling quite happy at the success of her first missional labor in the new field she was soon to occupy, left her at    i early morning in the care of Mrs. Ray. s*r            , .-r.^????,' ^^ssy"^   INTO THE LIGHT.          271 CHAPTER XXXVI.

THE deiw-drops were glistening   upon every flower and spray as Naomi stepped forth.  Thle clear blue sky, the smil- ing earth, rejoiced that another day, firesh and beautiful from the hand of its Creator, had birth. The outward loveliness corresponded with the inward joy of Naomi's heart, and lent to her countenance a charmn which fully justified H-Iorace Vin- cent (who had come to escort her home) in calling her "Aiu- rora, bright queen of the imorning !" Mrs. Park, President of the Sewing Circle, who saw them arm in arm fromn her parlor window, wondered what could have taken the minister out so early, and immediately thllought she couldl find out all about it througllh Miss Polly, who was always  so well posted in all that transpired in their quiet, little town; then she rememlbered that she was sick, and a sort of pity arose in her mind as she thought of the lonely wolnal, and she resolved to carry her something nice, to tempt her appetite; but further than tha t, any personal cf- fort or sacrifice she had no idea of makling.

She was not insensible, however, to the change of manner and tone which seemed to invest Polly with a new and more womanly tenderness,as she spoke of her gratitude bi lii, and hope of returning health.

"Let him come in, Mrs. Ray," she called, with a little of her old sharpness; "no time like the present " With much apparent concarll, Fleming expressed his re- gret to find her so very ill; and, after one or two indirect  compliments, which did not seem to make the least impres-   INTO THE LIGHT.         273 sion, he remarked that he had passed the minister and his intended, on his way thither, and had picked up a letter in the road, addressed to that fair lady, which she had doubtless dropped, and which he would leave in her care. "Would she be so kind as to hand it to Mr. Vincent, as it might con- tain something that he olught to know?  You and I, Miss Perkins, feel, I believe, that there is much room for improve- ment in that quarter, - do we not? - or reformation I should say?" and he smiled most blandly. Polly's Ikeen black eyes observed that the letter which lie held in his hand was unsealed, and, shrewdly suspecting that he was the writer, looked at him so intently that a faint flush passed across his swarthy visage. "It is of no use, Mr. Fleming!" she exclaimned ; "'whereas I was once blind, now I see.' If you meditate any harm towards that sweet lady, it will surely return upon your own head; for last night, when she was here, it seemed to me that I could hear the rustle of angels'  wings, and I believe that they encamp around her, attracting all who love purity and goodness within their charmed celestial sphere. "It is of no use," again she repeated, '" for such as you to follow her ; you cannot prevail against truth. I, who was once her enemy, am now her friend, made so by the po- tent power of her gentle, lovinC spirit. It would be well, , sir, if you followed my example." "Shade of Father  Abraham!" he mutterald. Check- mated! and D y an old maid, too!" Mrs. Ray entered just at that moment, and Fleming rose to take his leave, with a sardonic smile. "Your patient, madam," said he, "  is, I find, a little out of her mind, still;" and, angrily taking his hat from the table, lie swept off sundry vials and glasses, with them, breaking a goblet that was an old family relic, and only used on extra occasions. This was a serious loss to Miss Polly, and she called after him, earnestly, and excitedly, " ' One moment more, if you please, Mr. Fleming! I would advise you to  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7355-00000139"/> 274        INTO THE LIGHT. take some precautions after you leave here, lest you come to harm. My fever has been, without doubt, a contagious one; it prevails in this town, and many have died from it. It would be a pity that your valuable life should be sacrificed; it would be such a loss to society!" Polly's last shot, together with the loss of lher favorite glass, exhausted nearly all her little remaining strength; but as she sunk back among the pillows, she felt that her efforts, feeble as they had been, had cleared the field, and the dis- confiteed foe would not be likely to again retiurn. As Fleminog passed out, he was conscious of a constricted sensation in the throat, caused by the confined air of the sick- chamber. A nameless dread had1 )pervaded his mind whnll told that fever prevailed in the town, and he knew that lie was in a cold perspiration in consequence. Apparently scorningii  all fear, however, the Jew returned to the hotel, ordered a bath, and underwent an entire chanDge  of clothing, not without many anathemas upon the feminine world in general, and Miss Polly in particular. Baffled -and thwarted at every turn, Fleming almost re- solved to relinquish his pursuit of one whose minld and char- acter found no answerinr sympathy with his own. "Only her enchanting beauty," he thought, " will serve the same purpose in my house; as a fine picture, it will give it a finish which nothing else can. I will see her once more, and then, per- force, if I put off the old love I can easily don the new. Most women, like children, can be bought with gewoaws and baubles, the contemptible little fripperies that consti- tute the charm of their daily lives. Balh! the game is hardly worth the trouble I have taken. One more trial, and Naomi loses her chance of wealth and position forever." It was evening.  The moon had risen in unclouded splen- dor, and was casting soft shadows over the landscape that lIay in unrivalled beauty around the neighborhood of the NHall. Naomi and her mother had strolledcl out to enjoy the beauty   INTO THE LIGHT.        275 of the night, and await the coming of Mr. Vincent, who was somewhat later than his usual hour. They had reached a thick grove of fir-trees, and had pausedi to admire the deep green foliage, crowned by the silver moonlight above, that was weaving bright, fantastic garlands of mingled light and shade, and casting them far and wide, with queenly prodi- gality, over hill and dale. A rustle in a clump of alder- bushes near, and a slight cough attracted their attention, and Naomi exclaimed, ":Mother, there is IIorace! he has been playfully hiding, in order to witness my impatience at his long delay ;" and she sprang forward, her face beaming with delight, while her musical laugh at his boyish fancy rung out on the evening air. Both hands were seized with a passionate clasp, and a voice, that sent a shiver through her frame and made her heart stand still, murmured,-- "Idol of my soul! have I met you again? Oh, the weary waiting and watching of my lonely heart! Could you con- ceive it, you would, I know, pardon my boldness at this time; and here, again, I offer you the homagre, the idolatry of my whole filture life." Mrs. IITammet essayedl to speak, but paused as she heard her daughter's calm, measured tones of cool contempt. "Mr. Fleming, have I ever given you the slightest reason to believe that I would ever, under any circumstances, ac- cept of your addresses? I appeal to your honor, as a man and a gentleman, to answer that question truthfully." "Not certainly in writing," said Fleming, in whom tle evil spirit was fast gaining the ascendency; " but by those words and looks that fire the brain, and fill the heart with unsatisfied passion." The Jew had observed the figure of a mani approachfingl as he said this, and he resolved, whoever it might be, to give in that way one more venomous thrust at lher reputation. "'Tis false! false as your own base heart!" cried a deep, manly voice, in tones of suppressed indignation. The next moment Naomi felt Horace Vincent's protecting arm thrown  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7355-00000140"/> 276        INTO THE LIGHT. around her. She held his hand a moment, as she found him trembling with the excitement of a just resentment. L"For my sake, let him depart," she murmured, in low, pleading tones. Fleming's quick ear caught the import 6f her words, and, taking off his hat, he bowed low and mockingly. "Fare- well, lovely siren! I knew not that you awaited the coming of another gay Lothario. You will, doubtless, soon tire of him as you have of me," he hissed; and, serpent-like, glided into the shadows and passed from sight like an evil dream. Naomi's earnest eyes were raised inquiringly to Horace's face as they passed out into the moonlight; but she saw pict- ured there nothing but the most entire and perfect trust, and with bowed head and glowing cheek she listened, while he answered the speaking look, in the poet's words. "Doubt not beloved, - "' The sunshine of a cloudless faith, the calmness of a holy trust, Shall linger in our hearts till death consigns our dust to dust.2' Naomi felt that her lot was indeed a happy one: to be thus blest with the love of a true and generous man, who scorned to doubt or entertain a jealous thought of the wolan he honored with his affections. "Naomi, dearest," said Horace, gently and soothingly, "dismiss from your mind all thought of the wily schemer that just now crossed our path, and think only of that bright day on which you will receive a husband'sng care, and I shall be permitted to call you by he dear, sweet name of wife. I received a note to-day from Dr. Heber, in which he writes that Mr. Armstrong, with Gabrielle and Gazelle, will be present at the ceremony." "How I long to see those sweet children!" cried Naomi. "This only was wanting to complete my happiness." "Lean on my arm, mother," said Horace, turning to Mrs. Hammet, affectionately, " and let us turn our steps towards the house. A heavy dew is falling, and it may not be prudent for   INTO THE LIGHT.         2" us to remain out much longer. The damp night-air must not rest too heavily upon my heart-treasures." They retraced their steps until they stood beneath the spa- cious portico of Briarwood Hall. Mrs. Hammet entered the house, and left the happy lovers to that sweet inter- change of thought that admits of no third party; where heart speaks to heart, and mortals catch glimpses of that divine communion that is fully enjoyed only in the world of spirits. While they had been strolling leisurely towards the house, Mr. Carrington stood in a dreamy mood at the win- dow, watching the graceful figure of Mrs. Hammet. He no- ticed her closely-fitting, black satin dress, open part way from the throat, with the transparent lace handkerchief con- fined with a slight mourning-pin, the rich bands of dark hair looped at the back of her head, and even the small white hand that lay upon Horace's arm, and wondered if her heart would ever know another love, and whether he himself was many years older. "Robert, what are you thinking about," said his sister, "that you stand so like, a statue? Is any one coming?" He sprang forward without reply, and opened the door, which the summer breeze had closed, admitting the object of his thoughts. Mrs. Goodrich smiled at her brother's unusual impresse- ment, but said nothing, -the great event of the wedding being the one thought of absorbing interest. Julia, who was to be Laura's bridesmaid, came bounding into the room, full of delight, bearing a package just re. ceived by the evening express. "There, papa!" she cried, " my trouble is all over. My sash proves to be just wide enough ;" and- she looped the lus- trous folds of pearl-colored "ribbon over his broad shoulder, while he answered her bright smile with fatherly pride and indulgent affection. "Laura's sash is to be just like mine; and Miss Hammet's will be white, and Grace Vincent's also. 24  &#xD;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7355-00000141"/> 278        INTO THE LIGeT. Laura will wear orange blossoms, of course, and I am to wear roses. Don't you think it will be charming?" 'l To be sure, my dear! to be sure," he replied, good-ia- turedly. "Although I do not really know what it is all about." "I declare," said Julia, a little vexed, "I think father is real provoking! Don't you, Mrs. Hammet?" and she went on talking gayly to a more attentive listener. "Did you know that Mr. Bancroft sent me the prettiest ornamental box, contaiinig a handkerchief trimmed with lace so deep that only a tiny square of the linen cambric is to be seen, a pair of gloves, and a bracelet? He gave Laura a set of pearl ornaments that are perfectly splendid!" "It seems to me, Julia," said Mrs. Goodrich, " that you care more about the jewels and the dresses than you do about the wedding ceremony." "No, I do not, aunt; but I like the fitness of things, and Laura Vincent is so beautiful that pearls are the only orna- ments she ought to wear." "But, my dear," said Mr. Carrington, " you know that ' Beauty unadorned is adorned the most."' "Now, papa, who would have thought that you would have perpetrated that entirely. new and original quotation?" replied Julia, lauahing. "I believe you will take to writing poetry next." I T Your father has an artist's eye, I should judge by the paintingls which adorn these wall s," said Mrs. Hammet, " and why should he not have a poet's taste?" "Just imagine my father, Mrs. Hammet, with his eye in ' fine frenzy rolling, " said Julia, demurely. Mrs. Hammet cast a glance at the rotund figure of Mr. Carrington, met the expression of his rather dull blue eyes, and good-humored smile, and the effect was so comical that she thed in vain to conceal her merriment. Julia was taken captive at once by the indirect tribute to her humor, and the 'squire received the compliment   INTO THE LIGHT.        279 to his good taste with a satisfied complacency that was a perfect cordial to his rather moderate self-esteem. "My daughter has been growing saucy," said Mr. Carring- ton, " ever since she was appointed bridesmaid. I must draw the reins a little more tightly, or she will grow too mettle- some ;" and he stooped and kissed the rosy cheek as if he praised her rather than blamed. "Growing saucy!" said Mrs. Goodrich. "I think it is a constitutional disease with her, and not so easily eradicated." "Try homoeopathy, aunt, you think-. as do not H- that has accomplished wonders ; and, in the mean time, before you commence the new practice, let me talk as I please until after the wedding; then I will promise to be as docile a patient as you can desire." Mrs. Hammet had not the slightest idea of winning favor from any; but her easy, unaffected manners made her a general favorite with all, and the atmosphere of good-will and kind- ness that surrounded her at the Hall developed her best quali- ties. Mrs. Goodrich pressed her hand as they parted for- the night, and, with all a sister's affection, said how happy she felt at the prospect of having her as a neighbor and friend at the parsonage, and Julia kissed her fondly. Joseph Fleming wandered near the house that evening some time after they had entered it, nursing his wrath, think- ing to obtain another interview with Horace Vincent on his return home. He was anxious to see if the poisoned shaft he had hurled with so much malice had taken effect; but at last growing impatient, he suddenly changed his mind, boldly passed out into the moonlight, and an hour later found him on his way to the city, and, on reaching it, his first impulse was to seek the society of Victoria Mixer. His disappoint- ment and wounded self-esteem required the solace of her indirect flattery and evident wish to secure his addresses. From the bow-window where she sat in an idle, dreamy mood, she saw her so-called admirer approach with some degree of interest, as time had hung remarkably heavy on her hands  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7355-00000142"/> 280        INTO THE LIGHT. that evening, and she was really glad to see the visitor whom at times she scarcely tolerated. She noticed the gloomy expres- sion upon his face, and therefore was not surprised when he came in without a smile, simply saying, "Victoria, I have a severe headache ; bathe my heated temples, - will you?" and he sat down upon the lounge, and carelessly leaned against the soft, embroidered cushion, with a feeling of indifference whether she responded to his abrupt request or not. But it did not suit her mood then to notice his unloverlike saluta- tion, and, seating herself near him, she playfully sprinkled drops of fragrant coloygne upon his swarthy brow, at the same time smoothing back his dark hair with her slender, jew- elled finglers. Sweet, indeed, to the mortified man, was such a proof of interest! and, by a strong reaction of feeling, he half persuaded himself that, after all, she would prove as great a prize as the one which had so lately eluded his grasp. Only one impediment stood in his way, -it would not be good policy for himn to marry one who was lnot of the Jewish faith. He wondered if she could be induced to renounce her own; and thought it quite probable. He did not think she had any fixed r begious belief; he remembered that he had heard her say once that she thought one creed about as good as another, and that it was not of much consequence any way, what a person believed ; and he thought, with a grim smile of satisfaction, what a sensation it would create should he intro- duce his wife into the synagogue as a convert from the Christian faith, and then he sighed deeply, and Victoria with an air of solicitude inquired what troubled him. "I was thinking," he replied, absently, " how seldom one's fondest desires are gratified in this world; how many obsta- cles often stand in the way of the fruition of our cherished hopes." "' What are those hopes?" asked Victoria, with affected girlish timidity and a slight flutter of interest at her heart. "O Victoria!" he exclaimed, as if moved by an uncontrol- lable impulse, "would that you were of a kindred faith!   INTO TI-E LIGHT.         281 Would that I might bestow my hand andc fortune upon one who would nobly and generously say 'Thy people shall be my people'!" The fashionable votary of wealth and pleasure paused a moment before she answered, ere she made a final sacrifice of her truest and best conceptions, anld her eye rested upon a picture opposite, which represented the lovely, uplifted face 'of Beatrice, Whose calm, saifnt-like eyes were looking heaven- ward, while she drew her lover onward and upward by all holy and pure influences, and an imperfect apprehension of woman's angelic ministry on earth floated over her mind as she thought of the possibilities of a beautiful and harmoni- ous life with one true and noble spirit beside her, to whomn perhaps she, too, might become guide and comforter. But the feeling was but momentary, and when Joseph Flering, encouraged by her silence, repeated his offer, she accepted with a smile; and thus Victoria Mixer became the betrothed of one who awakened no feeling of tenderness or respect, but whose great wealth threw a baneful charm around its possessor, whichl drew her within its magic circle a too will- ing victim. Fleming urged an immediate marriage, and Victoria con- sented that it should take place within the month. The bus- tle and excitement of preparation she knew Would dissipate any unpleasant regrets which might arise, and, everything being satisfactorily arranged, she felt a sensation of relief when her impromptu lover took his departure. 24*  &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7355-00000143"/> N TO THE LIGHT. CHAPTER XXXV.                Oft expectation fails, and most oft there Where most is promising; and oft it hits Where lope is coldest, and Despair most sits. SHAKSPEARE. THE hours flew swiftly by, and the time drew near when the holy bonds of wedlock would solemnize a double mar- riage in the village of L . It was thought best to have the nuptials take place in the little church over which Horace Vincent presided; the cers emony to be performed by a brother minister from New York, in whose pulpit Horace had preached his first sermons. This measure suited extremely well those who., felt that they had, by virtue of a friendly interest and activity, a right to behold the ceremony which gave to their beloved pastor the woman of his choice. Miss Polly Perkins was among the most active and devoted of them all, and seemed to think she could not do enough to manifest her good-will. The album  bedquilt had been completed, and Polly's square occupied a conspicuous place near the centre. On it she had written, in a plain, bold hand: "Let nothing be done through strife, or vain glory, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than themselves." Philippians, 3. She had indeed received spiritual sight, and exhibited in her daily life the beauty and consistency of a humble Christian. After the wedding the bridal parties were to return to Briaxwood Hall, there to partake' of an entertainment pro- vided for them by Mr. Carrington. All was bustle and pleasurable excitement at the Hall preparing for the important event, while, in the city of New York, extravagant preparations were also going on for a   INTO THE LIGHT.         283 marriage, but under far different auspices. Sumptuous apart- ments were temporarily engaged at the hotel, while the elegant residence that once belonged to Reuben Hammet wa beillng refurnished in a style which suited even the exacting taste of the Jew's fair affianced. Through the fortnight that suc- ceeded their engagement, Joseph Fleming had experienced a feeling of lassitude and inactivity, which led him to look with comparative indifference upon a display which would have awakened his pride and ambition at any other time. The Mixer family, in all its branches, gathered at the cere- mony, which was performed according to the Jewish service in every particular. Looking only upon the surface of things, they considered that the finest feature of the occasion, and rejoiced that one among so many dalughters had become "well settled."  The bridal pair were to start for the White Moun- tains immediately after the ceremony; but when all was over, and Victoria sought her chamber, in order to exchange her elegant bridal attire for a stylish travelling-dress, she found her husband- -who had seemed quite unwell in the morning--bathing his head with ice-water, and complaining of an intense pain in the temples. She stood looking at him a moment, in consternation, for he really looked ill, and she did not like the idea of their journey being delayed: more than that, she did not know anything about sickness. I-He ordered some pulverized ice, and, rolling it in a napkin, tied it around his head, - a measure which only enhanced thle gloomy expression of his countenance, and did not by any means improve his complexion. He reclined upon the lounge, apparently without a thought of their journey. Victoria at last grew impatient, and asked him what he proposed to do. "Tell Sam to take the carriage back to the stable," he re- plied. "I cannot ride until I am relieved of this racking, pain in my head." He answered her withl some asperity, for no tender expres- sion of concern had passed her lips, - she had been too self- &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7355-00000144"/> 284        INTO TIIE LIGHT. ishy engrossed with her own disappointment. Recalled to a sense that some attention was required for the occasion, she gave the servant the message, and then, seating herself beside him, fanned him gently, while she talked with anima- tion of the various places they would visit on their journey, hoping to make him forget the pain, although she knew they were too late for the cars on that day. Not liking the idea of playing nurse a whole evening, she told him she knew that he felt better, and playfully insisted upon taking the bandage from his head. He yielded to her influence, and declared that his head did feel somewhat relieved. "Then suppose we go to the opera, this evening," said Victoria, with a little, merry laugh. "You know that you must not refuse me anything, and I have no doubt but it will be the best prescription you can possibly have." Fleming did not feel able to make the effort, and was greatly inclined to refuse; but she looked so brilliant and handsome when she smiled, that he gazed upon her with admiration, and felt that, just then, he could not refuse her anything. The carriage was ordered, and a short time after they were seated in a crowded house, the close atmosphere of which caused the old, throbbing pain in Fleming's temples to return. "I feel," said he to Victoria, a short time after they en- tered, " as if I were going to be seriously ill." "Oh, I guess not," she answered carelessly; " the ventila- tion here is rather imperfect; when the curtain rises the house will be cooler." She turned to look at him as she spoke, and found him looking ghastly pale. Presently he told her that he thought lie felt faint, although he never knew before what the sensa- tion was. He seemed too unwell toremain, and they hastened out to the carriage, and fortunately found Sam in waiting, whlo assisted his master to enter with some degree of wonder, as he found him shaking all over, and, his teeth chattering with a  heavy chill. Flceiingl was too much frightened about   INTO THE LIGHT,        285 himself to notice that Victoria sat upon the opposite seat, as far away from him as possible, with her handkerchief held to her mouth, in great alarm lest she, too, might inhale some sickness. Great was their relief when they reached the hotel. "Hurry, Sam," cried his master, "as soon as you leave me, and bring a physician as quickly as possible!"The sick faintness that camrne stealing over him, every now and then, made him feel that it was something more than an ordinary chill. A doctor soon arrived, and pronounced it a case of fever. Suddenly Fleming thought of the fever which prevailed in the village of L--, and the unpleasant conviction forcedl itself upon his mind that he was - seized with the same con- tagious disease. "Doctor," he cried, in great excitement, "if you will break up this fever at once, I will give you five hundred dollars." "I always try to do the best I can, sir, to throw off dis- ease," said the doctor, gravely; "but I never expect, or wish, to receive more than my regular fee. You had better have a nurse, as soon aspossible, and keep perfectly quiet." Fleming groaned, as he thought that even money, in this case, was of no avail, and he resigned himself into the care of a strange nurse, with a feeling of utter despondency; for Victoria declared that she did not know how to do the first thing for him, and soon retreated into an adjoining apart- ment, while he moaned the sleepless hours of the night away. Quite late the next morning, Victoria came into the sick- room, attired in the elegant embroidered dressing-robe she had hoped to wear under very different circumstances, and inquired, with evident interest, how her husband felt, for she hoped that it might be only a temporary illness, and that they might yet undertake their intended journey. She was star- tled, as she laid her jewelled fingers upon his brow, at the burning heat, and noticed that he looked a little wild, al- though he spoke quite rationally. *  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7355-00000145"/> Just at that moment, some one knoclked at the door; and Victoria, glad of an excuse to leave the bedside, opened it hastily. A colored man stood there, with a letter, which he said he was ordered to deliver into Mr. Fleming's own hand. Fleming saw instantly that it was Ben, the former servant of Reuben Hammet; and, partly rising in bed, he shouted, excitedly, "Be off! be off!" Ben no sooner saw the cadaverous face and threatening gesture of his old master 's nephew -whom he always feared -than he dropped the envelope at Victoria's feet, and fled, in wild alarml, never stopping until lie reached the es- tablishment where he had been employed as a trusty carrier and porter ever since Mr. Hammet's decease. "The, fellow came here to solicit charity, no doubt," said Fleming, " and probably that envelope contains his testimo- nials. No! don't bring it here," he cried impatiently, as the nurse was about to hand it to him; "I can't look at it now - away with it!" "Your name   is upon it, Joseph, and very well written," said Victoria, as she took it from the nurse, and tossed it carelessly into a  drawer among some loose papers, little dreaming that she was literally throwing away the cherished hopes of a vain and worldly life. Day succeeded day, and Joseph Fleming knew, for the first time, what it was to be alarmingly ill. The fever had seized him with resistless force, and he lay, at times, passive under its powerful influence, and then again he was restless, im- patient, and arbitrary, and at such times he would ignore the presence of the nurse, and make constant demands upon his wife's time and attention. This was an unlooked-for discipline from which she saw no escape, and she coldly nerved herself to the task, with the unquiet ,consciousness that she had voluntarily surrendered her liberty without an adequate return. Rabbi Ben Zara called frequently, to her great annoyance, bringing with him a huge volume of the Jewish law, in order to read those pas-   INTO THE LIGHT.        287 sages that he thought were appropriate and comforting to the sick man, who strove in vain to derive strength from that which contained for him no spiritual nutriment. One morning, after Fleming had passed a restless night, he had fallen into a short, unquiet slumber. Victoria had seated herself at the extremity of the large apartment, and was gazing listlessly out of the window, with a vague feeling of uneasiness at her heart, which seemed a premonition of coming evil. She observed a great commotion in the street, people were running in all directions, the city bells were ringing, and within doors there seemned to be an unusual number of persons passing rapidly through the halls and over the stairs. Fleming awoke, and with angry impatience called for Vic- toria. " Why do you allow so much noise in the immediate vicinity of my chamber ? What does it all mean? " he asked. "I do not know," replied Victoria, with cool contempt. "I do not consider myself a supervisor over other people's movements, and therefore am not responsible for any noise outside of our own apartments." "Nurse, ring the bell ! " he cried, with fretful impatience. "I must know why I am so disturbed. I pay a small for- tune for these rooms, and I want them kept quiet." "John," he inquired, as the servant promptly answered the bell, what's the trouble in the house? Is the tower of Babel let loose?" "The trouble is outside of the house, sir," said the man, respectfully. "One of the most extensive conflagrations that the city of New York has known for many years is now taking place. A great many warehouses have been burned, and some private residences; the citizens are turning out to aid the firemen. They say that the lower end of Wall Street is a prey to the flames." "How'! what!" cried Fleming, in great excitement, as he thought of his own buildings near that locality. "Wall Street, did you say? " &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7355-00000146"/> 288        INTO THE LIGHT. A moment after he sunk back on his pillow, with a grim smile of satisfaction, as he remembered that they were fully insured, beyond their value, even. The servant had no sooner left the room, than a messenger arrived from Fleming's head clerk, announcing the entire de- struction of the block where they transacted business, and a request to know if the "1 insurance was all right." "Yes, of course," replied Joseph, "' or I should have had a notice that the policy of insurance had expired, and I gave express orders that such notice should be delivered into my own hands." "Victoria," he continued, turning to her, "I shall rebuild a much handsomer block with a granite front. On the whole, I think it quite as well that they have burned down; it will remove a business firm near that have been my annoyance for years." A hurried knock at the door was again heard, and the up- holsterer who had been employed in Joseph Fleming's house appeared, with his clothes scorched and face and hands grimed with smoke. "We did all we could, sir, to put the fire out; it did seem such a pity to have all that rich damask burned up, and I had just hung every curtain in the house. I hope you won't let the loss fall on me, Mr. Fleming, for I have a large family." "I don't know what you mean by all this tirade," ex- claimed the sick man; " come to the point at once. What is it all about?" "Why, sir," stammered the man, " your house in F-- Square. The burning cinders from the great fire fell upon the carriage-house and it was soon in a light blaze, and the wind being high, the pine scaffolding around the observatory that had been used by the painters caught first, and all one side of the square has burned down." Fleming put his hand to his head a moment, as if to un- derstand the matter more fully. 1"That also is insured," he   INTO THE LTGHT.         289 said, complacently; u although it kill be somewhat of a loss, our house, I think, can sustain it easily." "' Then I hope you will see that I do not lose anything, sir," said the upholsterer, anxiously. "4 Yes, yes! certainly," replied Fleming; 'your claim shall be attended to. You can go now." "Are you sure of what you say, Joseph?" asked Victoria, quickly, as the man bowed himself out. Her evident uneasiness seemed suddenly to be shared by her husband. "Of course it is all right," he said. "Hand me my small memorandum-book, Victoria; it is in the pocket of my dressing-gown," With more eagerness than accorded with her usual languid movements, she searched for what he desired, but found only one or two business orders for goods. "I remember now," cried Fleming; 1' look in the drawer of yonder papier-mache table. I thrust some loose papers in there, and my little brown Russia leather-covered book among them." Victoria hastily crossed the spacious apartment, and soon held in her hand the book he required, and what seemed to her excited mind the seal of her destiny. Suddenly her face blanched, her brain grew dizzy with fear, and she gasped for breath, as her slender fingers rested upon the raised letters on one corner of an envelope she re- membered to have scornfully tossed out of sight as a chari- table appeal, when brought by one whose sable hue alone always called forth her contempt; and, quick as thought, she read, "Office of U-- Insurance Co., Wall St." With a sharp, hysterical cry she tore it open, and there found what she so much dreaded, the blasting of her fondest hopes; that for which she had tacitly renounced her religion, and that truth and purity of the heart and affections which is the crowning glory of womanhood. She heeded not the frantic call of her husband, but allowed the nurse to take the book and envelope from her hand, while 25  &#xD;<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7355-00000147"/> 290       INTO THE LIGHT. she sunk down overwhelmed with the mighty tide of regret and self-reproach that swept over her. One bitter wail issued from the lips of Joseph Fleming, as he read,- "SIR, - Your policy of insurance at this office expires on the 30th of May, at 12, noon. If you wish it renewed please notify us before that time. "OFFICE U--   INSURANCE CO., WALL ST." Fleming had been confined over a week in his sick cham- ber, and it was then near the middle of the first week in June. This confirmation of his wildest fears was too much for the overtaxed brain and weakened system of Joseph Fleming. He threw off the bedclothing and sprung into the middle of the apartment, crying wildly for his hat and coat, -just as the doctor arrived, and found his patient in wild delirium, who seemed to be calling upon Reuben Hammet to take what rightfully belonged to him, - he would not keep it, - he did not want it, could the rest only be spared to him, so that he need not become a beggar; and then with a plaintive moan he sank into a kind of stupor, which afforded a temporary relief for the disturbed mind and sorely tried conscience of the hitherto prosperous Jew. Victoria saw her own position in all its bearings, and re- mained immovable, with her head bowed upon her arm, even after the physician entered. She heeded not the wild ravings of her husband, but decided at once that she would desert him, then and there, and return to her father's house. She was suddenly aroused from her selfish abandonment to sorrow, in a way that she least expected. She heard her father's well-known voice, and saw him enter with a pale and excited countenance. "Victoria, my daughter," said he, sorrowfully, "I am a poor man. This terrible conflagration has stripped me of every- thing. Can you not say something to comfort me, you who   * l INTO THE LIGHT.        291 have all that heart can desire? Doubtless your husband is fully insured against all losses." Victoria raised her hand with a despairing gesture, as she thus drained the last bitter drops in the cup of retribution that had been held to her lips, and felt that she was by necessity tied for life to the partner she had chosen. She had cultivated no resources, no faculty or taste that would enable her to do anything towards her own support; the refuge of her father's house was virtually denied her; and she poured into his astonished ears the story of her husband's losses, and her own trouble and disappointment, with angry volubility, blaming her father for allowing her to marry for money, and charging her own folly upon one who had always been an over-indulgent parent. He looked at her a moment with forbearing tenderness, and realized for the first time how great a sacrifice his daugh- ter had made, and essayed to comfort her; but she impa- tiently begged him to go away and let her alone, and he reluctantly left the disappointed wife alone indeed in her grief, to feed upon the husks of worldly pride, ambition, and selfishness, which her own hand had gathered. In due time, Fleming recovered from his severe attack of illness a wiser, but not a better, man; his greatly reduced circumstances seemed to develop all the low cunning of his character. He became miserly in the extreme, and the pawnbroker's shop he afterward opened proved a suitable field for the exercise of his peculiar talents.  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7355-00000148"/> 292        INTO THPE LIGHT. CHAPTER X XXVIlI. The spireless church stands plain and brown The winding road beside, The green graves rise in silence near With moss-grown tablets wide, And dearer far than sculptured fane, Is that gray church to me - For in its shade my mother sleeps Beneath the willow-tree. MRS. HORSFORD. MORNING had parted the veil of night, and peeping through its misty folds shed a soft amber light upon cottage, upland, and lea. The inmates of the Vincent homestead seemed to be still slumbering, - when, as the sweet, glad voice of the robin pealed forth its hymn of praise, there issued from the vine-covered portal the slight, girlish figure of Laura Vin- cent. Her soft golden-brown hair was gathered into a large knot at the back of her head, from which one or two stray curls had escaped.  These, being lightly stirred by the breeze, gave the only evidence of life in that fair being, so statue-like did she stand gazing upon the glorious beauty of that summer morning. The sun, which had for the last few moments been sending up long lines of rosy light, reaching even to the zenith, seemed suddenly to spring forth, as with one glad bound, from his couch of fleecy clouds, and, with inexhaustible prodigality casting his beams far and wide upon meadow, streamlet, and glen, seemed to awaken and animate all- nature. The joyous songs of innumerable birds soon filled the air. The cattle that had been lying upon the green hill-sides began to crop the dew-laden verdure and move about with a sub- dued, quiet kind of enjoyment.   The locust-tree which shaded the dwelling, stirred by the sweet south wind, shed a   INTO THE LIGHT.        293 shower of fragrant blossoms upon the head of the young girl. Casting her eyes over the fair landscape in deep and joyous admiration, she murmured, "'Tis a world worthy of its beneficent Creator! Shall I bid farewell this day to the scenes of my youth, my girlhood joys? Can it be possible that I am so soon to become a wife? What a child-wife I shall make! and how happy I shall be with Percy as my husband!"  Fair as that bright morning were the scenes of ideal love- liness that floated before her charmed fancy. Life, the fu- ture, seemed a gladsome summer dream. Sorrow, -with its deep, mysterious chastenings, had but slightly clouded that young brow or dimmed the lustre of those soft brown eyes. "We know not what we are, much less what we shall be." Yet there is a strength of character, an intellectual power, folded away in the deep recesses of that youthful spirit that if properly developed will make her a woman whose home influence shall possess, for her husband, a strong attractive power. Throwing on her large straw hat, all the while singing a low, sweet melody, she took her flower-filled basket upon her arm, and passed out into the sunshine and shadow that crossed the rural pathway. She had not gone far when a rich, cheery voice accosted her. "Well done, Miss Laura Vincent! I will frankly say that I doubted if you would keep your promise. I scarcely hoped to see you thus early!"  And Percy Bancroft approached her, dressed in a light linen coat and Panama hat, looking almost as young as herself. "My own darling!" he continued. "Why do you wish to take a walk to the lonely church-yard on this day of all others, when every thought should be couleur de rose, - this bright day that will, before its close, impart to my life its greatest blessing?" ' Why, Percy, I do not associate any idea of gloom with 25*  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7355-00000149"/> 294       INTO THE LIGHT. my mother's grave. I have had many happy thoughts be- side it. And now with you I go to bid it farewell for a short time, and leave my floral offering of love upon that grassy mound, - the last tribute of my girlhood days!" "But not the last of youth and joy," replied Percy. "You do not fear to trust your happiness in my keeping, Laura?" She was kneeling by the grave as she spoke, and her up- lifted eyes were beautiful in their expression of innocence and trust, as she earnestly replied,!"Fear! not while there is truth and goodness personified in the one I love." "I am satisfied, Laura, that the roseate tints color quite enough your fond imaginings. You will perhaps awaken to find me a very ordinary mortal, with some few virtue3 and many faults." "Which I shall correct as soon as possible," said Laura, smiling. "Do not fear that I shall made too much of an idol of Percy Bancroft; I do not consider him perfect by any means." "Only rather fine-looking," said Percy, with some curiosity. "Simply good-looking, that is all," she replied. "Very well, my birdling; I see that there is no danger of your spoiling me by flattery. So that you love me ever, I care not for aught besides." And the two lovers strolled arm in arm adown the shady lane, enjoying the beauty of that sum- mer morning with hearts attuned and responsive to all the sweet sights and sounds of nature. They parted at the lit- tle gate, to carry the remembrance of that lovely morning through all their future lives as a bright dream of youth and beauty, while Laura entered the homestead to make her final arrangements for the important ceremony that was to take place that day. The golden moments sped rapidly away, ladened with the bright anticipations of those loving hearts that were soon to be united in one solemn covenant. And Naomi, arrayed in simple white muslin, stood in Mr. Carrington's   INTO THE LIGHT.         295 spacious parlor, awaiting the entrance of Horace Vincent and his sister Grace, whom she had seen alight from the car- riage which had been sent by Mr. Carrington to convey the bridal party. When Horace met Naomi, he paused a mo- ment to behold her surpassing loveliness, and then, folding her. to his heart, he murmured, "My own! my beautiful!" He could not realize that she, whom he almost worshipped was soon to unite her life with his, to be his alone. It seemed like some delightful dream. O Horace!" exclaimed Naomi, every feature irradiated with joy, "Gabrielle and Gazelle Armstrong have come; they are here at the door with their father. How every wish of my heart seems gratified!" " Almost boisterous was the greeting, and wild the delight of those affectionate children. There was a joyous mingling of voices, at first, when Julia entered, over all of which rose the clear, sonorous tones of Mr. Armstrong in congratula- tion. "I left the doctor and his family just behind," he said, "and, yielding to the entreaties of Gazelle, I just hinted to the horses that we would'-like to travel a little faster, and we flew along in fine style, to the great satisfaction of puss, here, who was pining to behold her beloved teacher." Gazelle stood holding Naomi's hand, looking as happy and gentle as a fawn; every now and then gazing up in her face with a satisfied smile. "O Miss Hammet!" she whispered, "I never was at a wedding in my life. Will you love me just as well when you are Mrs. Vincent?" "Just as dearly, darling Zella. If my name is changed, my heart-will be the same." Mrs. Hammet soon made her appearance, dressed in a steel-colored silk, looking unmistakably the lady, to the great delight of Mr. Carrington, who stood watching every move- ment, ready to escort her through the hall. The happy groups were soon on their way. The village church had been filled  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7355-00000150"/> 296        INTO THE LIGrHT. to overflowing, an hour previously; every eye was watching their beloved pastor. Horace and Naomi, with Grace, entered first and took their places at the altar. A murmur of admiration ran -through the crowd, for never had they seen so handsome a couple. Then followed Percy Bancroft and Laura, with Julia Car- rington, and stood upon the other side facing them. The officiating minister lifted his hands in prayer; a holy calm seemed to descend upon the audience; then followed the marriage ceremony that bound together for weal or woe those young and trusting hearts. Almost like a dream it seemed, so quickly was it over. When the benediction was pronounced upon the married twain, a solemn silence for a moment fell upon all that were gathered there. Then came merry greetings and congratu- lations from all. Dr. Heber was the first to kiss the minis- ter's new wife. Grace pressed forward to the side of Laura, -a kiss, and "God bless you, darling! my darling no longer," broke from her quivering lips; and then, by an effort mastering her emo- tion, she addressed her as Mrs. Bancroft, and then and there yielded her utterly to the love that had claimed and won her. The bridal party drove rapidly to the Hall, where a hand- some collation awaited them; but the guests, as is often the case at such times, scarcely noticed the fine taste displayed in the -decorations, so much were they absorbed in their own happiness. Percy Bancroft and his bride were the first to leave. "Are you content, dearest?" he inquired, when they were once more in the carriage, as he drew his arm tenderly around her. ' Not yet," she replied, enjoying for the moment, his look of surprise. "I have one more farewell to make. I crave a kiss, and a blessing from the dear old man at the old home- stead, whose feebleness makes him keenly sensitive to dem- onstrations of affection."   INTO -THE LIGHT.        297 "Most certainly we ought," he replied; and soon Laura's bright head was bent before the venerable man, and with a hand upon each, he uttered an invocation, and pronounced a blessing, which cast around them a pure atmosphere of peace as they departed. Mrs. Hammet and Grace Vincent had preceded Horace and Naomi, and they were waiting at the parsonage to re- ceive them, and welcome them to their beautiful but humble home. Beautiful, indeed, it looked, as they' approached. The setting sun was casting a flood of glory over hill and vale, lighting up with new beauty the flowering vines that twined in rich luxuriance around the rustic pillars that sup- ported the veranda. The parlor windows, reaching to the floor, were open, displaying the green, cool-looking carpet, and simple furniture. Beneath the latticed porch stood Grace Vincent and Mrs. Hammet. "' Home, sweet home!" said Naomi. "Wife, sweet wife!" replied her husband. "Are you happy in the thought of being the 'wife of a poor minister, Naomi?" "Beyond expression happy," she replied, and met his lov- ing gaze with a look in which all the charms of a wife, mis- tress, and matron seemed blended. Horace lifted her out, and with eager interest and curios- ity she entered the parsonage and passed into the pleasant parlor she had seen from without. The first thing which at- tracted her attention was an elegant piano, which stood open in a sort of alcove at one end of the apartment, its white keys gleaming in smiling welcome. "O Horace!" she exclaimed; " where did this splendid instrument come from?" "Here appears to be a little card attached," he replied. She lifted it and read: "A wedding-gift from Dr. Heber and wife." "How munificent! How kind were those dear friends, to remember my greatest passion, music!" said Naomi.  &#xD;<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7355-00000151"/> 298        INTO THE LIGHT. "Now I know the important business that called you two out, that day, when you returned so mysteriously. "O husband!" she continued, " can you not see the bright future, the balmy summer evenings that we shall enjoy inl this sweet place, blessed with each other's presence, while music shall lend a charm to beautify and sanctify the whole?" "One more surprise, dearest, awaits you," said her hus- band; and he led her near one of the windows that looiked into the shadowy wood beyond, and there beside it stootl her father's crimson-cushioned arm-chair, with its familiar branches of oak-leaves and acorns extended over the seat so protectingly, presenting withal so Jewish an aspect that many sad and sweet memories were awakened, and her dark eyes were suffused with tears, as she turned with a glance of love towards her mother, and, putting her arm around her, led her to it, and bade her take possession of the only relic left of past affluence, saying, as she kissed her, 1"My home shall be thy home; and my people, by adoption, will, I trust, in time become thy people." "Did this, also, come from Dr. Heber?" inquired Mrs. Hammet. "No," replied Horace. "I discovered it by the merest accident, at the house of a brother clergyman, who had bought it at the auction. I succeeded in purchasing it of him, for it was in that chair, Naomi, that your father sat, when he first gave me permission to call at your elegant res- idence, and I wanted you to possess at least one precious souvenir of the past." Grace stood a smiling spectator of their happiness; and, after Naomi had explored the rooms, and praised with genu- ine pleasure, the plain, unpretending furniture, the two sis- ters went together upstairs, where all was neatness itself. The snowy curtains, the white spreads, and ornamented pillow-slips (the work of some of the parishioners) were duly examined. More than one gave evidence of Miss Pol-   INTO THE LIGHT.         299 ly's industry and exquisite needlework, who made it a prin- ciple to do with her might whatever she undertook; and, now that her energies were bent in the right direction, she had proved by her good works, through various channels, how entire was her attachment to the minister and his wife, and how thorough her conversion to a new life. Bouquets of flowers were placed in every conceivable nook, giving the otherwise plain rooms a festal appearance. As they returned to the parlor, Naomi paused before a tiny moss basket, containing a few common wild flowers, the gift of little Agnes Ray, and inhaled their delicate fragrance with delight. "Sweet forest darlings!" she murmured, as she bent over them lovingly; " you come to me like a beautiful dream of summer time. I can almost see a mossy dell, with bees and butterflies, and singing brooks, along whose banks these roses wild and daisies sweet once clustered." I' How dearly you love those children of the wild-wood!" exclaimed her husband; " those nurselings of the sun and showers! Do you not read mysterious truths, not known to all, upon their glowing' petals? Is not every leaf a poem, bathing thy soul with thoughts of beauty? "Dost thou not draw hidden harmonies from the flower's heart, which breathe into thine ear sweet melodies of love divine? Emerson says, The sparrow sings to my ear, and the river and sky sing to my eye ;' then why not the flowers?" ' True," replied Naomi; " and another author, Eichen- dorff I think, beautifully says, - "' Sleeps a song in everything, Dreaming ever till 'tis stirred; All the world would rise and sing, Could we wake the magic chord.' " A sweet fulness of content pervaded the minds of the' newly-wedded pair on that loveliest day of summer's prime. For their desires were few and simple, and they had learned  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7355-00000152"/> 300        INTO THE LIGHT. that " the true life consisteth not in the abundance of worldly possessions." Yet they were, in the highest sense of the term, rich indeed. The carriage, which had been waiting to convey Grace to her home and daily duties, was at the door, and the lonely, but not sad, girl bade them a cheerful good-by, took up her cross patiently, and found the Divine Consoler near, aLndl ready to lighten half its burden. Naomi seated herself at the instrument, and the rich, sweet tones of her powerful voice rang forth in that exultant- strain, "I know that my Redeemer liveth;" while her husband's voice, uniting with her own, rose in one glad choral hymn of praise. "I never sing those words," said Naomi, " that I do not feel a tenderness, mingled with compassion, for those of my own nation (sons and daughters of IsraeD, who are shut out from the light and blessing of that faith which I now con- sider the crowning glory of my life." "Beloved wife!" said Horace, gently, " when we conse- crate our new home to God, - when we bow before Miessiah's throne, let us remember his chosen people, and plead for their speedy restoration to the land of their heritage, through faith in the Holy One of Jacob. One prophecy after another is rapidly being fulfilled, and the time is doubtless very near when their blindness shall be taken away, and thy people shall once more take a high position among the nations of the earth." Naomi sang once more, but in a minor strain, which breathed of hopeful, patient waiting for the glory of the promised future, when "' The Hebrews shall again come to Zion, and the excellency of Carmel, and the beauty of Leb. anon shall be given unto them."

T. FIELDS. And the maiden-meek voice of the womanly wife Still bringeth the heavens nigher; Bidding me climb up higher. GERALD MASSEY. As the months rolled on, the inhabitants of L--     felt that a blessing had indeed descended upon them through the labors of the new minister and his wife; and the pres- ence of Naomi grew to be the light and charm of many a humble home. Ever present as a spiritual comforter in hours of sickness and trial among his. parishioners, Horace Vincent, in his comparatively small field of labor, accomplished far more than many a city pastor, who calls upon the families of his charge perhaps once or twice a year, and feels that he has performed all that is required of him in that department of duty.  He gathered from time to time a goodly harvest, watching and watering the tender plants which grew under his care, with the dews of divine grace, bringing personal effort to bear upon every doubting, troubled soul, and lead- ing them forth into the serene beauty and peace of his own interior life. Truly, when called to give an account of his stewardship, he will go richly laden with sheaves. Horace and Naomi went often to visit Laura in her city home, after she returned with her husband from Italy, and tried to believe her as happy as themselves; but somehow 26  &#xD;<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7355-00000153"/> 302        INTO THE LIGHT. they missed the girlish vivacity and sparkling humor, which had given to the old homestead its greatest charm. The delicate blossom which had been transplanted to a new soil drooped for the want of the constant and elevating influence of the lovely character which had ever been the joy and com- fort of her childhood days. She pined for Grace, as her other and better nature, while she saw so clearly the intense selfishness of Percy Bancroft's character, veiled, indeed, by the most polished politeness, but yet persistent and unmis- takable throughout his daily life. Grace had apprehended somewhat of Laura's disappoint- ment (the greater because she really loved her husband), and, whenever they met, had indirectly given her advice which tended to encourage the hope that the example of her own earnest efforts for his and others' good would in time effect that revolution of habits, thoughts, and feelings, which would cause him to fully realize her girlhood's idea of a true and noble man. She taught her that in married life none realize their fondest dreams. With all the fervor of her frank, ingenuous nature, she set before her sister the pernicious tendency of much that is felt, written, and spoken regarding the incompatibility and want of affinity of parties who have assumed the marriage relation; leading men and women to think that in consequence of any uncongenialities, any marked difference in taste and opinion, any revelation even of traits and qualities which may seem altogether evil, that the holy covenant, into which they have each voluntarily entered, may be ruthlessly loosened or broken, and vows registered before God and man may be cast aside as though they had never been uttered. She urged her to dwell upon all that was pleasing in her husband's character, - all those tender attentions and loving words which had first won her youthful heart, and which of late had become almost power- less, because she had looked beyond them, and beheld only the shadow of a selfish nature resting over all. She bade her count up rather the blessings of her married life, take   INTO THE LIGHT.         303 courage and press on, in earnest, patient endeavor for the soul she had vowed to love and honor. Laura apprehended the truth of much which Grace had spoken; she knew that she had been led to dwell too much upon the imperfections of Percy Bancroft's character, and that her manner had assumed an air of cool indifference which piqued, annoyed, and puzzled him ; but she did not know that by such conduct she was weakening her power over the ver- satile nature which had drawn so much delight from the naturalness, truth, and affection of her own; and to her, more than any other before, he had yielded (at times) his wishes and plans. After Grace left her, on the day when she had imparted such wise and tender counsel, the young wife sat a long time motionless; a dreamy thoughtfulness pervaded every linea- ment of the sweet face, as memory recalled some moments which might have been made happier, had it not been for the unsatisfied reaching forth beyond present duty, towards the bright but deceitful vision of unalloyed happiness in domestic life. Presently the clear brown eyes were lifted with a new and more hopeful light in them, and a smile of tender trust played around the beautiful mouth, as she arose, approached the glass, and untied the net which had confined, in a heavy mass, her luxuriant hair, and, taking a jew- elled comb from the bureau, she parted and wound it round her fingers, letting it fall in graceful curls over her shoul- ders; then, laying aside the brown travelling-dress which she always wore when she felt dissatisfied and weary, she arrayed herself in a delicate blue dress (Percy's favorite color), and fastened around her neck a rich point-lace collar, which her husband had presented her weeks ago, and which she had never worn. As she seated herself near the window to watch for Percy's return, Laura repeated the lines which Grace had quoted, -- "' One by one thy duties wait thee; Let thy whole strength go to each.'"  &#xD;<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7355-00000154"/> 304       INTO THE LIGHT. Through the power of a word spoken in season she had awakened to a new sense of her wedded responsibilities and duties; and, in that new light, had resolved to forget herself and make the most of the companion she had chosen for life. She knew that he was 'susceptible and sensitive to those graces of manner and charms of mind which had called forth all that was highest and best in her husband's character, and which of late had been neglected. Just as far as we forget self, and learn to live for the good of others, just so far do we u, -lcrstand and realize the beauty of those words of the great Master, "Behold, the kingdom of God is within you." Laura's memory recalled many a conflict in her girlhood days, from which she had. emerged purer, stronger, and bet- ter; and, with the power of a resolute will, she planted her feet upon a higher plane, rose superior to mere personal in- terests, saw her duty, and the path to its performance. When Percy came home that day, he exclaimed, ib Why, Laura Vincent! what a pleasant surprise! How lovely you  look in that blue dress and those curls which you have hid- den so long beneath a net! Pardon me, my wife! --Mrs. Bancroft!- I repeated your maiden name involuntarily when I saw those curls, any one of which, in my lover days, I would have given a small fortune to kiss ; " and he lifted one heavy, golden-brown ringlet, and kissed it with genuine emotion. Laura did not appear to notice those signs of deep feeling, but entertained him with some of her morning's experience in making calls, and then played and sang one or two songs, while Percy stood by and turned the leaves of music, as he had done many a time before, unconsciously assuming his old manner of devoted attention. As she finished playing, he took out his watch, and looked at it with surprise. "Do you know, my bird of song, that you have wiled me away firom the club, to-niaht? I had intended to be present; but I certainly should not have spent the hour so pleasantly. "Suppose we take advantage of the fine moonlight, Laura, cr      cr   INTO THE LIGHT.         305 and walk in the Park, - will you not? I know not when I have felt so much elasticity of spirit." Laura hesitated one moment, for she had taken more exer- cise than usual that day in walking, but her assenting smile had no trace of weariness in it, as she thought, "I will not refuse, as I have too often done before." "You must go and get my hat and cassock, then, Percy. I always give you something to do when I take you as illy attendant," she replied, playfully. He sprang with all the eagerness of a boy to do her b)i(!- ding, for those little, importunate, and at times arbitrary demands upon his attention were rather a source of pleasure than otherwise, and grew to be wished for, when they did not interfere too much with his native indolence and love of ease. Her womanly caprices had amused him, and lie loved the silken bondage which held him spell,.ound near her, whenever she chose to be in a gracious mood; but of late lihe had missed those changeful fascinations, and he knew very well that she did not approve of much which she saw in his character; that she was grieved when he was selfishy way- ward and domineering; that she felt he ought to use his time and talents more worthily, and apply himself to the profes- sion he had chosen; and he had thought seriously of a more useful and active life. Her winning ways had been replaced by a certain cool dignity of manner, which seemed to remove him at a distance, and left him restless and dissatisfied with himself and all arotund him; and he hailed with delight the new and more pleasant state of feeling manifested. As they passed out, Percy asked, in a joking mood, if he should take a cigar. The red lips curled with an affected scorn, and a slilght satirical smile dimpled her cheek. "My husband is a gentleman!"Laura simply answered; "Icannot have him put himself upon a par with those effemi- nate youth, who walk beside a lady, puffing the smoke of a cigar in their faces, as unconcernedly as they will regale her with the odor of cardamoms, cachous, and cloves." 26*  &#xD;<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7355-00000155"/> 306        INTO TIIE LIGIT. "Why do you think they chew those things, Laura?" in- quired her husband, with an amused smile. "I have always," she replied, " supposed them to be a dis- guise of the too fragrant breath, which else might betray the presence of those alcoholic mixtures which are stealing away their manhood and self-respect."    l; "No doubt that is sometimes the case, my Mentor! and the indulgence of any habit, regarding which there is any secret shame, any attempt at disguise, proves unmistakably that the man islunder its evil influence. I like occasionally, in its proper place, the smoke of a nice cigar; but the wine- bibber's feverish, repulsive breath shall never cast a shadow over the happiness of your home, little wife! I need no other stimulus than your own genuine self, as you are, and have been to-day." Laura looked thoughtful again, as she pondered upon those words. "Percy, what attracts you so much to the club-rooms?" at length she said. "I always thought they were for bachelors alone." ' Not exclusively, by any means," replied her husband, laughing. "To tell the truth, I do not enjoy an hour there as I once did; but of late I have conceived the idea that you were getting somewhat weary of my company, and so I feared that satiety might lead you to undervalue my perfections. I promise you that I will not go again, if you wish it." Laura smiled, as she said, ("I do not wish to bind you by any promises, Percy; I only hope to make home so pleasant that you will not seek for happiness elsewhere."' They had seated themselves where they could see the dark blue waters of the bay in the distance, sparkling in the moonlight (ever moving, ever changing, resting never, like the emotions of the human heart), and as they watched the snowy-crested waves steadily rolling towards the shore, the regular movement of the waters had a tranquillizing effect upon their minds, and for some moments no word was spoken.   INTO THE LIGHT.        307 Then the time and the hour seemed suited for the interchange of confidential thought, and the husband and wife sat hand in hand, nearer in spirit than they had ever been before, com- muning upon their past and future life. Both felt conscious of many faults, and realized their dependence upon each other for home happiness. That evening hour aroused them to loftier purposes, to a truer union of heart, sentiment, and feeling, and revealed to them the power which one soul has over another either for good or ill; and, as they slowly wended their way homeward, they experienced a sweetness of content, a confidence in each other, and a certainty of future harmony, which nothing earthly could disturb. Grace Vincent did not dream of the beautiful harvest of immortal fruit which would be garnered in coming years, through her instrumentality. She came to see them as often as she could be spared from her constant attendance upon her aged grandfather, the evening of whose days was mel- lowed and irradiated by her presence, as he passed slowly and serenely down the vale of years, with a heart's gratitude and love resting each day upon the fair girl in fervent bene- dictions.  The unobtrusive beauty and symmetry of Grace Vincent's life imparted many a useful lesson, whenshe knew it not, to those who had not acquired her power of self-control, self- sacrifice. It was not surprising that she should be again sought in marriage. More than one suitor wished to appro- priate the sweet lily of L--- to himself. Stanley Safford felt that she came very near his ideal of what a true, harmonious woman's nature should be. Her neatness was without a blemish, even in his critical eyes, and her calm, equable temperament and uniform kindness of manner when they met led him to entertain the hope that she did not look upon him with indifference. When Grace went to Laura's home, he always made some errand to the city, and happened in just in time to escort her back. In coming from church he was ever by her side, and  &#xD;<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7355-00000156"/> 308        INTO TIIE LIGIT. had volunteered to sing in the choir because she sat there, and lent the music of her clear, flute-like, but not powerful voice, to aid and sustain the uninstructed few who sang the psalms and hymns in her brother's church. Her transparent character caused him often to think of those expressive lines in Milton's Comus, - "So dear to Heaven is saintly Chastity, That when a soul is found sincerely so, A thousand liveried angels lackey her, Driving far off each thing of sin and guilt, And in clear dream and solemn vision Tell her of things that no gross ear can hear." One day Stanley Safford met her at the depot on her re- r turn home, and, taking a seat beside her, laughingly pro- nounced himself her knight-errant for the occasion. "Miss Vincent, is it not a fortunate thing," he said, " that we have met?" -attributing that fact to the merest acci- dent, when he had watched and waited for her the last two hours. "That depends, Mr. Safford," replied Grace, smiling, "upon circumstances; our meeting involves you with the charge of my baggage, and draws upon your politeness as a railroad companion to be as agreeable as possible." 1"Would that I might aiso be a companion for life!" ex- claimed Stanley, in low and earnest tones of emotion. "I can conceive of no joy greater than to be ever near one who has become dearer to me than all the world beside." Surprised into a premature avowal of those sentiments which had been growing and expanding within him for the last few months, and which involved his happiness in no small degree, Stanley Safford colored and stammered when he saw the look of -extreme surprise upon the face of his companion, and, forcing a laugh, he attempted an apology. "It is not now or here that such words in jest even shouldl be spoken. Miss Vincent, forget my chance remarks; for- give me, I pray you, for being so thoughtless," he continued,   INTO THE LIGHT.        309 as he observed her hand tremble and her cheek grow very pale. "The lovely daughters of New England regard even jesting upon so vital a subject as love so differently from the women of the sunny land of France. They take a declara- tion with the greatest nonchalance, as a matter of course, and set down the name of the last suitor as coolly as they would an engagement to dance." Stanley saw that the color was returning to Grace's cheek, which had startled him from its extreme paleness, and he knew that she thought him only in one of his satirical moods. Hie expatiated upon the charms of the country through which they were so rapidly passing, and drew her mind away firom those glowing words which had escaped him unaware. Still, the purpose to know his fate remained strong within him. When they reached the village of L--, he escorted her home, and as they were about to part, and she extended her hand to thank him and bid him " farewell," he lingered a moment, unwilling to bear on his mind the burden of uncer- tainty another day. "1 Miss Vincent," said hd, with serious earnestness, "I wish very much to have a few moments' conversation with you. May I come in?" Again the startled expression came into Grace's blue eyes, but she could not decline, and he entered the little parlor of the homestead as reverently as he would have entered the temple of a vestal. He gazed around the little room where he had often been of late, and was impressed anew with a sense of the comfort, peace, and harmony which pervaded it. He beheld her loving, tender greeting of the old man, whose happiness she so constantly studied, and his heart grew faint within him as he thought, - "Perhaps she moves upon a plane far above me, and does not think, as do many women, that marriage is the great end and aim of life. She has a practical independence of char- acter, which may stand in the way of an offer of marriage;  &#xD;<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7355-00000157"/> 310        INTO THE LIGHT. yet I must put an end to this suspense; I cannot bear it longer." He arose and went to the window which looked down the garden path, raised the curtain restlessly, and impatiently awaited the reappearance of Grace. He scarcely replied to the old man's attempts to draw him into conversation, and when, a short time after, she came in - having laid aside her travelling dress- attired in simple white, he advanced towards her, and, with a grave expression of countenance, asked to see her alone. He was indeed thoroughly in ear- nest then, and with a beating heart Grace opened the little side door and passed out beneath the vine-covered portico. The shadows of declining day crossed the pathway which led to a picturesque alcove beyond, and thither they bent their way. A sweet-briar, in full bloom, had clambered over the lattice-work, making the rustic arbor appear one mass of verdant loveliness; a faint odor of mignonette and helio- trope filled the place, and for years after Stanley Safford painfully recalled that hour whenever he chanced to behold those delicate blossoms. He gave Grace a garden-chair, and, too restless and agitated himself not to desire motion, he paced up and down the little retreat a moment before he spoke. Then he who seemed so proud and cold in society became a suppliant to the gentle girl before him, and in manly, ardent words revealed his love. He told her that she had be- come very dear' to him, - that he loved her truly, devotedly. "O Miss Vincent!" he continued, "you know not the strength of a passion which rules a reticent nature like my own; it is all powerful, all absorbing. I am ready to devote myself fully to your own sweet will, - that will which I know is actuated by the highest and purest of motives. I 'do not ask that my love shall be returned with the intensity which rules my spirit, but with the calm, gentle, constant, and beautiful truth of your own. I never believed that I should love thus. I am translated into a new world of the affec- tions, and have lately become more charitable, more loving,   INTO THE LIGHT.        3" towards the whole human race. Do not, oh, do not, I beseech you, decide too hastily!" he cried, as he observed that she looked pained and distressed. "I would share with you a nature which is not ignoble. I would spend with you a life, dear girl, that shall be full of usefulness and beauty. I would lavish upon my heart's treasure all the wealth I pos- sess. I would give the world, even, if I had it to bestow, for one assurance that my love is returned. I have never before made an offer of my heart to any woman, because I could not do it unreservedly. I must fully and thoroughly esteem the mind and qualities of the one I love, and the woman I marry becomes my equal in all things; I shall respect her rights as companion, mistress, and friend, and I believe that you above all others could aid me in my plans of future usefulness. "O Grace! pause before you speak, and then let the an- swer bring me happiness and rest!" As Stanley gave utterance to those impassioned words, there arose for one moment in the mind of Grace an involun- tary yielding, a consenting of the spirit. She felt that she could do much good in a Wider sphere of action, by the abun- dant means which he possessed, and she saw much that was noble and pleasing in Mr. Safford's character; and, on the other hand, she saw a life of comparative loneliness, bright- ened, it is true, by the faithful performance of daily duties, but without intellectual companionship. But could she thus sacrifice her highest intuitions? Would she do right to let him hope that her heart was his, when she knew that she did not really love him? All the truth and purity of Grace Vincent's nature arose in protest. No! a thousand times no! She could not take the solemn marriage vow upon her lips without the love that alone makes it a true union. The memory of her own disappointed affections filled the mind of Grace with regretfill tenderness for the suitor who had just made her the highest offer man can make to woman,  &#xD;<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7355-00000158"/> 312        INTO THE LIGHT. and when she raised her soft blue eyes to his they were filled with the tears she could not repress. He knew, then, before she uttered a word, that there was no hope. I' Mr. Safford," she said, gently, " such an avowal as yours demands a better return than I can ever give. lIy first duty, as you know, has always been to my grandfather, and I could not leave any one else to minister to his daily wants." "But why not let me share the task?" he interrupted, eagerly; " if that be all, you could not have a more faithful attendant than I would be." "But that is not all," replied Grace, in a low tone, while the crimson tide of maiden delicacy rushed over cheek andl brow; " your generous frankness leads me to say that which else would never have been spoken." "You love another," he said, with sad, imploring earnest- ness. "I have loved once," she replied, with downcast eyes; "' but have long since buried those affections, and can now stand by their grave with a heart filled with gratitude to 'Him who ordereth all things well.' I shall never marry, Mr. Safford. I think too many of our sex take upon them- selves thoughtlessly that important relation, without a knowl- edge of their own hearts, and hence an imperfect, and some- times very unhappy life is the result; but I would have you my friend still; can I hope that?" "When time shall permit me to cherish calmer emotions for you, Miss Vincent, then you may rely upon my friend- ship. The woman I have once loved can never be like any other in my eyes. I shall leave my native land again for an indefinite period. I, also, shall never marry! and, as the years roll on, you will, I trust, sometimes kindly remember the far-away." Grace wept as he wrung her hand at parting, and, in broken accents, murmured, "Heaven guard you, Grace, al- ways! and save me from this bitter grief!" and passed out   INTO THE LIGHT.          313 into the deepening twilight of that summer evening a disap- pointed, lonely man. Again the faint, sweet odor of mignonette and heliotrope floated around him, as he crushed their flowers beneath his hasty tread. Even so in the future will the memory of affec- tion's bruised and withered blossoms linger around his spirit with a hallowed, chastening influence. Grace quietly wiped away her tears and re-entered the house, receiving the witness within herself that she had done right. Truth had triumphed, the temptation had passed, and left her self-reliant and strong. CHAPTER XL. For something that abode endued With temple-like repose, an air Of life's kind purposes pursued With ordered freedom sweet and fair. A tent pitched in a world not right, It seemed, whose inmates, every one, On tranquil faces bore the light Of duties beautifully done. "EIGH HUNT. SUMMER had passed, and the golden, mellow autumn days, with their clear skies and cool, invigorating breezes, were upon the land. Days of beauty and harmony had come and gone, not without some cares and trials to the Vincent house- hold ; but those shaded threads woven into life's history only served to bring out more brightly the blessings which clus- tered around their daily path. Let us look within that little parlor once more before we     - bid farewell to its happy inmates. Naomi's mother is seated by a  side window, in her favor- ite Jewish chair. She is looking much younger than when we saw her last. The peace and quiet of her country home 27  &#xD;<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7355-00000159"/> 314        INTO THE LIGHT. had done much towards restoring Mrs. Hammet's former beauty, and she was, indeed, what Laura Bancroft, called a splendid woman. So thought 'Squire Carrington during his frequent visits at the parsonage; but that fair and stately lady gave no encouragement to the possessor of Briarwood Hall. The present with all its joys was hers, in witnessing the happiness of her beloved children,--the future was veiled; but there came to her at times a sense of rest and trust that could only proceed from those glimmerings of di- vine light that were struggling upward within her soul, and would in time unfold to her spiritual perceptions the full glory of the risen Saviour, - a triumphant faith in the Re- deemer of Israel. Near Mrs. Hammet, at a table, stands a tall, spare figure clad in a drab-colored alpaca, with a plain muslin neck- erchief- almost Quaker-like in its neatness - folded across her bosom. She is vigorously cutting out garments from a roll of cotton and calico, which lies upon the carpet. We find her the same bustling, active spirit as ever, but with her energies constantly flowing in the right channel. The expression of her face has changed, softened, become more truly womanly, from the exercise of kindly charitable feel- ings springing from a truly renewed heart. Yet Miss Polly Perkins had not parted with the keen sagacity -which she brought to bear even upon trifles where her friends were concerned. She devoted herself as much as possible to the interests of her beloved pastor and his wife. If anything was to be bought for the society or the household, no one could do it better than Miss Polly, and they very well knew that nothing would make her so happy as to send her on some errand where she could make herself useful. She is bending over her work, and has just indulged in one or two- half-suppressed laughs, as Mrs. Hammet in- quires, "What is it amuses you so, Miiss Perkins?" "Why, Mrs. Hammet, I was thinking of that that turkey which lies on the dresser in the kitchen. Mr. Vincent said I might   INTO THE LIGHT.         315 speak for the dinner as I came up this morning to sew, as the Armstrongs were to be here. Well, two or three turkeys had just been brought into the shop as I entered, and I saw that the finest had been suspended in the window to tempt customers. I selected the best one, which I no- ticed the man took down rather reluctantly, paid for it, and had it sent right along,--it got here almost as soon as I did. As soon as I laid my hand upon it, I knew that it was not the turkey I had bought. Of course he said it was; but I insisted, and to his extreme surprise told him that when he brought the right one I would prove it beyond a doubt. In a short time after he returned with the veritable ' Simon Pure.' 'Now, Miss Perkins,' he said in triumph, ' how can you prove that I did not bring the same turkey which you bought?' 'Because,' I replied, 'I stuck a pin, when I bought it, under the left wing, in order to make sure of it; and there it is, a shining witness to the fact.' He laughed,- he could not help it, - and grew just as red as a beet. ' Well, you are a cute one,' he exclaimed, 'and no mistake.  It aint no use for anybody to try to get around you.' And he walked off with his basket, whistling, but looking rather crest-fallen. I tell you, Mrs. Hammet, I am wide awake where the interests of this family are concerned. Look at the other end of the room, will you? Don't they seem happy?" Horace Vincent in dressing-gown and slippers looked quite the family man, as he sat near his wife reading from a manuscript which he held in his hand. A slight smile could be detected playing around the corners of his handsome mouth as he caught Miss Polly's words; but he took no no- tice, because he had learned to look beneath all that was eccentric in her character, and appreciated the true and faith- ful devotion which led her to watch their welfare with greater tenacity than she would her own. Naomi had on a pretty lilac-colored chintz morning wrap- per, bordered with a bright trimming, which suited well her  &#xD;<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7355-00000160"/> 316        INTO THE LIGHT. clear, olive complexion. She had drawn her little sewing- chair quite near her husband, whose arm was resting on her shoulder, and was listening attentively. The deep, tender, intelligent eyes-brightened by some pleasant thought- met his in approval of a sentence he had just read. HHe paused a moment and gazed fondly upon the sweet face, then resumed reading, but in a different tone; and these were the words he read, - "Could my spiritual perceptions become intensified like those of the servant of Elisha, I could, I am sure, behold a halo around your head, dear wife, - the halo of a true and contented life." "Why, Horace " she exclaimed, blushing; ( that paren- thesis does not accord with the rest of your sermon." "I know it," he replied. "' That was inserted for Gazelle here, her especial benefit." The twins had arrived that day to make their promised visit, and Zella was sitting on the carpet, with her arms crossed in the old fashion over Naomi's lap, looking up into her face with childish devotion, watching each word which fell from her lips. The uplifted, animated face, framed by the shining auburn curls, the large, luminous eyes, the fair, broad brow and small, beautifully curved mouth, presented a picture which Naomi loved to look upon. She bent over her fondly, and kissed the rosy cheek. The child threw both arms about her neck and whispered, "How I wish you were my mother!- then I might stay with you always, Mrs. Vincent. " "You shall make us a long visit, darling, and while you stay I will call you my little daughter." Gabrielle was playing a lively air upon the piano, and Gazelle, at those words, made a little, graceful courtesy, say- ing. "Thank you, mamma," and whirled around the room with a waltzing step, keeping time to the music, and looking in her corn-colored, embroidered dress like a butterfly indeed. Grace Vincent had been invited to spend the day, and was   INTO THE LIGHT.        317 sitting near, quietly stitching a wristhand for her brother Horace, looking out every now and then over the fair, land- scape with a dreamy, peaceful air, as if " sweet thoughts lay upon her heart, like dew upon the flowers." Presently her face brightened, and she stepped out upon the veranda and listened a moment; then, looking back over her shoulder, she nodded pleasantly and said, "1 I think we shall not be disalp- pointed; I hear their horses, and they are coming to spend a good long day. Yes, there they are," she cried, pointing to a bend in the road, as Laura and her husband came in sight. The twins clapped their hands with delight, for Mrs. Ban- croft was a great favorite with them. She had invited the little girls frequently to visit her, and when they came she was for a time as much a child as themselves; she liked to throw off her matronly dignities and wander again on the "green sunny banks of her childhood, where the violets and buttercups grew." Percy sprung from his horse and assisted his wife to alight, - shaking hands all rounds - and the next moment she had sought her childhood's resting-place and was clasped to the bosom of Grace. "O you dear, good, sweet sister!" she cried, "I was afraid I should not see you to-day. How's grandfather?" "Very feeble, but as well as usual. I do not know that he would have felt willing to spare me to-day," continted Grace, "had it not been for your thoulghtful kindness, Percy;" and she gave him her hand and looked into his eyes calmly and affectionately. "The ' Life of Washington,' which you sent him, will occupy him for more than one week. The beauti- ful -engravings and large, clear print delighted him, and he said, 'My dear child, I think my eyes are getting stronger, and I can read without so much difficulty. I shall not care to hear you read aloud to day.' And so I left him in charge of Aunt Hannah, and was not long in coming over here, I assure you." Laura looked at her husband approvingly as she said, 27*  &#xD;<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7355-00000161"/> 318        INTO TH1E LIGH1T. "( This is one of your good thoulghts, Percy, bearing fruit. You never told me anything about it. But I suppose, brother Horace, he considers me his left hand,--being near- est the heart, -' and will not let his left hand know what his right hand doeth.' " "I had forgotten it, indeed," he replied, smiling, at the same time gathering up her riding-skirt attentively, and lay- ing it over her arm as she went forward to greet Mrs. Ham- met. Miss Polly stood. a little in the background, feel- ing somewhat out of place amicl the happy family group, but yet her heart beat fully in unison with the general joy. Laura Bancroft put her at ease at once; admired the cal- ico she was cutting from; noticed the little bundles of work, arranged with mathematical precision upon the window-seat, and said, "What would they do without you, Miss Perkins? It is no small task to cut out so many. garments." "I like it, Mrs. Bancroft," she replied; "I feel so much happier when I can do anything for the society." "We all know that," replied Laura, " and appreciate your constant labors; but what would you say, Aunt Polly, if I should tell you that my brother has received a call to go to the city? Do you see that letter which he holds in his hand?" Polly looked, and saw that the minister was indeed bend- ing over an open sheet of paper, with a grave face. Her mouth opened wide, both hands went up as she gasped, "IDon't let him do it, Mrs. Bancroft; it would be sinful to leave this people when the ' fields are white already to harvest.' He has done so much good here, his labors have been blessed in so marked a manner, that it has seemed to me that the Lord looked with peculiar favor upon this little branch of his vineyard." Polly's eyes looked very much as if blinded by tears, as she pretended to search for her thimble, drew out a handker- chief from the depths of her capacious pocket, and turned towards the window. Presently the minister spoke, and she was all attention.   INTO THE LIGHT.         319 "This letter comes through Dr. Heber, does it not, Mr. Bancroft?"' "Yes," replied Percy. '"It is, I believe, from the church where he worships, and he wished me to say that he was coming to see you in a few days with his wife; that the church committee, with one accord, had chosen you above every other pastor named; that the society was in a very flourishing condition, and the salary, as you see, is exceed- ingly liberal. "It seems to me, Mr. Vincent, that a fine opportunity is here offered you of extended usefulness." Naomi came and stood beside her husband (who remained silent a moment, in an attitude of deep thought), and, with one hand resting on the back of his chair, she patiently but not anxiously watched the next words which fell from his lips. "Do you think, brother Percy," he inquired, while his fine eyes beamed with a deep, serene light, " an extended field of labor so very desirable? Would you advise a gardener who had received supplies sufficient to water, well and faithfully down to the very roots, thefew plants entrusted to his care, to take those same supplies into an area three or four times as large, where the fertilizing moisture would be only suffi- cient to penetrate a short distance below the surface, and the many objects of his charge would become dwarfed and unfruit- ful, through insufficient nourishment? "No; I do not aspire to the fame of being a popular min- ister; I would far rather, when the Master calls me home, bear the record of a few souls complete in Christ Jesus. I shall not decide hastily, although I think now that I cannot part with my little church, - the ewe lamb which I have so tenderly cherished and carried in my bosom." Naomi bent over him and pressed her lips upon his fore- head, -  they were one in sentiment and feeling, - and then, with a light heart, went out to attend to some household duty. As   she opened the parlor door, a hearty ' Hallelujah!  &#xD;<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC7355-00000162"/> 320        INTO THE LIGHT. Amen!" broke from Miss Polly, who had rushed out, when the minister ceased speaking, to conceal her emotions. She was a source of never-failing amusement to the twins, and when they caught the sound of her voice, a peal of child- ish, irresistible laughter rang through the room. Gabrielle ran out after her, and soon came back with her captive, who was looking a little ashamed at being so tender-hearted, say- ing, "Aunt Polly is going to teacll us a new game after din- ner, if we will hold and wind some cotton for her now;" and the little girls received employment for at least a half an hour, while Miss Polly plied the scissors with new vigor, mentally calling herself the happiest spinster alive. Grace brought the wristhand she was stitching, and meas- ured it round her brother's hand, while her gentle eyes looked approval into his of the sentiments he had just uttered. Percy Bancroft urged him, with great earnestness, to think more favorably of the change proposed, especially as he saw Laura's drooping lids, and the air of disappointment which pervaded her whole face and figure. 'She had hoped so much from her brother's influence, when it should be brought to bear more directly upon the mind of her husband, in spiritual things; but she knew that lhe would do rightly, whatever might be the personal advantages offered. "Never mind, little wife," said Percy, affectionately, " if your brother does not settle in the city now, the time will come when he himself will consider such a measure his bound- en duty. His talents and usefulness are becoming known and appreciated, and we will hope for his removal near us, some time, even if he decides now to the contrary." As may be supposed, the Rev. Horace Vincent did not ac- cept the temptation offered. HHe remained two years longer, a faithful pastor over the little flock which he so tenderly loved. At the end of that time he felt justified in leaving the field open to a brother minister, whose aims, motives, and pur- poses were as elevated and unselfish as his own, and who was   INTO THE LIGHT.         321 ready to devote himself to the people of his care with ear- nestness and zeal. H1 had waited until he could find a kin- dred spirit, who would faithfully and tenderly lead them " by cool Siloam's shady rills," and constantly present to their minds the beauty of "Sharon's blooming rose." Although he would much rather have remained in the shady, quiet nook of his little home, where domestic happiness had filled his soul with gratitude and love, over which the dove of peace had folded her soft wing, yet he had asked, in trusting' prayer, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" and, obedi- ent to the monitions of the Spirit, he had, without desire for worldly good or fame, entered upon a new field of labor, where the Master had called his faithfulf steward. Two years later we find the young minister and his wife, amid the ease and plenty of their city horme, with the same blessed union of heart, mind, and feeling, that, like a rain- bow, had spanned with light the limits of their early and more humble dwelling; with a bond of love, too, which had blossomed into life and beauty beneath their fostering care. A partincg glance reveals the happy mother bcnding fondly over her beautiful boy. Ah, why does she start and listen with wonder and delight? Does she ]lear the low murnlur of some pebbly stream, or the wild, t!lrilling song of a bird? Ah, no! it is something which stirs the fountains of feeling, more deeply still--'tis the exquisite lisping sound of her babe's first word. Then, nestling like an April blossom, the soft blue eyes gently close, and sleep steals upon his fringed lids, while round his mouth a smile of sweetness lingers, as if some an- gel earthward straying had paused to kiss the rosy lips, and whisper dreams of heaven. "Little darling bird of Eden! Sweet bud of promise, pass- ing fair!" murmurs the happy mother, as she fondles her sleeping child. A voice whose deep, rich-tones always fell upon her ear like  &#xD;<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC7355-00000163"/> 322       INTO THE LIGHT. sweetest melody answered those whispered words of love, as the husband and father bent over his home treasures. "Naomi, beloved wife! do we not rejoice that we have here a little immortal, who may one day swell the song of Israel's redeemed, singing glory to the King of kings! the Hebrews' true Messiah?"  "Ah, yes!" replied Naomi, while a rapt expression of joy- ful faith lighted her dark, starry eyes, "I believe the ran- somed tribes will soon return from all lands, bearing the cross of Calvary in triumph, while the shadows of unbelief shall flee away before the splendor of the 'true Light' for- ever."   &#xD;</p>
