"It is the truth, girl, the truth Death's&#xD;
chill is at my heart, and the fierce, wild fire&#xD;
upon which my life has lived so long, is nearly&#xD;
out. The embers glow hotly, it is true, but&#xD;
they will soon expire !"&#xD;
"Mother! mother !" and great tears rained&#xD;
from Luona's eyes as she spoke.&#xD;
"Grieve not, child-grieve not! Thou'lt&#xD;
have no time to grieve when I am gone ; for I&#xD;
shall leave thee too mich work to do for that!&#xD;
The world will not be cold to thee, for--humble&#xD;
though we seem to others-I have gold which&#xD;
will be thine, and thou shalt be a very queen F&#xD;
But mark me, girl ! let not that world or aught&#xD;
within it, know that thou hast a heart! Love&#xD;
not, nor listen thou to words of love from the&#xD;
lips of men ; for they are but treachery, and&#xD;
death is in them.&#xD;
With a wild vehemence, which almost belied&#xD;
the thought of approaching death, these words&#xD;
were uttered. But the speaker's voice fell, ana&#xD;
her tone was more low and very mournful, a&#xD;
she continued&#xD;
"Eighteen years ago, Luona, I was two years&#xD;
younger than thou art now, and my mirror told&#xD;
inc that I was beautiful. And I was pure, all&#xD;
unknowing of the evils of this dark. bad world.&#xD;
Sin had not entered the portals of my heart;&#xD;
for I had a dear mother to watch without, even&#xD;
as I have striven to watch over thee ; but she&#xD;
knew not, as I have learned by many a bitter&#xD;
teaching, howc ruel and how vile that outer&#xD;
world was ; for her world was in her home, her&#xD;
guide the Bible: her trust in God ! And when&#xD;
from that world a gallant-looking man cane,&#xD;
with manhood sittin. on him like a grace, and&#xD;
honeyed words upon his lips, nor sIe nor I&#xD;
believed him other than he seemed, one mold-&#xD;
ed after creation's Creator! I never had seen&#xD;
his like before, and it was but an easy task for&#xD;
him to win my heart ; for I loved to gaze upon&#xD;
his noble form, to dwell upon the music of his&#xD;
lips. Time moved on with rapid steps ; and I&#xD;
all dreamily went forward-for he was ever with&#xD;
me. Wildly, passionately I loved him-loved,,&#xD;

CHAPTER I.&#xD;
TUE CURSE OF THE DYING AND THE MISSION OF&#xD;
TIHE LIvIN--A HISToRY OF WRONo AND DES-&#xD;
OLATION, AND A CRY FOR VENGEANCE.&#xD;
"Girl, come hither! I am dying; but, be-&#xD;
fore my wrecked spirit breaks its strained&#xD;
shackles aid departs into the dark unknown&#xD;
which lies before it, I hive acurse to utter, and&#xD;
a charge for thee, to both of which thou must&#xD;
listen and give heed when I am gone, lest the&#xD;
curse of thy lost mother should cling to thee-&#xD;
to thee, child, instead of him for whom it is&#xD;
intended ?"?&#xD;
Extended upon a plain-but cleanly couch, in&#xD;
a humble cottage, tree-shaded arnd vine-em-&#xD;
bowered, iii the village of New London, lay the&#xD;
woman who uttered these words, but a short&#xD;
time prior to the war of the American Revolu-&#xD;
tion. She was not old-for not a thread of&#xD;
silver had Time or sorrow laid among the&#xD;
masses of black, glossy hair which overhung&#xD;
her white brow, and thin, pallid face. Her thin&#xD;
fora, wasted features, and the fierce, unnatural&#xD;
brightness of her large, black eyes, al-ne sec-&#xD;
onded the thought which her bloodless lips had&#xD;
spoken-that she was dying.&#xD;
In health she must have been very beautiful ;&#xD;
every feature chiseled as by some rare sculptor's&#xD;
hand, each limb-a marvel of loveliness andj&#xD;
grace, even now-told this. And proud and&#xD;
haughty-flashing eye, firm lip, thin and swell-&#xD;
ing nostrils, spoke thy that.&#xD;
Yet not more beautiful than the girl to whom&#xD;
she spoke, who was just bursting into woman-&#xD;
hood. Till, stately, with an eye more soft, t et&#xD;
all as dark as that which gazed upon her ; fea-&#xD;
tures which told of a will imperious, and a&#xD;
heart full of fire, yet under stern control of self;&#xD;
in figure exquisitely shaped ; she was one alike&#xD;
fitted as a study for a painter, a model for a&#xD;
sculptor, or a vision for a poet's eye to dwell&#xD;
upon.&#xD;
"Do not say that you are dying, mother-&#xD;
dying, to leave your poor Luona all alone in&#xD;

&#xD;
until, knowing not my crime, I fell-fell from&#xD;
that spotless plain where  " had found me.&#xD;
And when my fall was knosuo, as all too soon it&#xD;
was, my mother fell-fell into the arms of&#xD;
death, to rise no monre. And when he tired of&#xD;
me, as soon lie did, and fled fruom  my side, I&#xD;
followed, oily to learn that another had a wifely&#xD;
right upon him-that he was not only a hus-&#xD;
band, but a father. And then I cursed him, as&#xD;
now I curse, with all of hell's hot bitterness,&#xD;
his memory ! My love curdled into hate, and I&#xD;
swore to be revenged! I still had beauty. I&#xD;
sold all that my poor mother   sad left, and&#xD;
moved to a town where no one knew me. There&#xD;
I met your father. He wooed moe and won my&#xD;
hand. I married him, not that I loved him ;&#xD;
but he hal wealth, and with it, l knew that I&#xD;
could buy vengeance upon him who wronged&#xD;
me. You were born ; but yot r father died be-&#xD;
fore you were of ani age to lisp his name. I&#xD;
then remove I to this place, to ie near him&#xD;
whose ruin I had sworn to accomp1lisi!"&#xD;
Whoa as lie, nmotlier ?" asked Luona, who,&#xD;
with breathless interest, had listened to the sad&#xD;
narration.&#xD;
"Lemuel Arnold !" was the mother's reply.&#xD;
He died a miserable bankru it. as you know";&#xD;
and his lat hours were emlbittereid with my&#xD;
curses, and with the k noiw h ue  hat I had&#xD;
wrought hisI pecunimar ruin, and lput blots upon&#xD;
his name wluicli no net of his couil ever efface.&#xD;
Arid I told him  then-aud 1 now renew the&#xD;
vow-that not with his death should my hatred&#xD;
cease. lie has a son ! To you, Leona, I leave&#xD;
the ruin of t iat son. I know, I feel that the&#xD;
spirits of haln omen, shut out front heaven, are&#xD;
domed to wanidehr unseen iiun ihe earth where&#xD;
they has e sinned  that they can know no other,&#xD;
fo lbott r li lI, and his ejirit shall writhe in&#xD;
agony over the ruin of his only child ! Swear&#xD;
to rie, girl, sear by may wrungs, by my just&#xD;
hat red, by that which has consumed mye ery&#xD;
existence, arid thus early laid me on the bed of&#xD;
death, that thou wilt do as I bid thee ! Exalt&#xD;
hii:, only to erash him ; lead him  on and up&#xD;
uni life is bright, and ftre is in li grasp,&#xD;
unt: ie over-tips Ii s helhiw-imen, then dash him&#xD;
don ai so low that the meanest worm  which&#xD;
craig Is may be above him! Swear it, Luona !&#xD;
swer it!"&#xD;
Mother, I swear to do thy liddi ng!"&#xD;
" Io it, girl-do it ! I cuir-se hin n's I cursed&#xD;
his fatier-for in his form, his every look, his&#xD;
voice, its mien, his treacherous father lives&#xD;
again !"&#xD;
"lie shall envy yet his father's fate !" said&#xD;
Luona, bitterly.&#xD;
" It is well,~ehild-it is well ! When I am&#xD;
passed away, you till tind my vill. All that I&#xD;
have is tlhine. I appoint no guardian for thee ;&#xD;
for I have so educated thee that none is re-&#xD;
quired. My hank-account i5 larger than the&#xD;
world supposes; with ordinary prudence, you&#xD;
will through life be indepenaent. And now,&#xD;
child, go you to your room, and let me rest&#xD;
&#xD;
awhile, for I am weak and weary. Let me not&#xD;
be distprbed, for my last hour is near !"&#xD;
There were tears in the eyes of Luona, and&#xD;
her face looked very sad ; but she obeyed her&#xD;
mother, and went out.&#xD;
About an hour later, the doctor came, and he&#xD;
hurried into the house ; for a storm, which had&#xD;
been for some time gathering, was about to&#xD;
break. Although the sun hand not yet gone&#xD;
down, the black clouds, which hung pall-like&#xD;
between the earth and sky, cast a somibre shade,&#xD;
more dark than tsiilight, over all things.&#xD;
Open the window, child," said the mother,&#xD;
as Luona entered with the physician.&#xD;
"It is about to storm, miy mother," replied&#xD;
the girl.&#xD;
"Ay. It is well that my spirit should de-&#xD;
part when the elements are at war, and ill earth&#xD;
in turmoil. Open the window, and let me look&#xD;
upon the drivi..g clouds, upon the red light-&#xD;
ning ; let the full tones of thunder coie rattling&#xD;
on my ear. I do not fear. I die, as dies the&#xD;
soldier on the battle-field !"&#xD;
"Mother, the doctor is here !"&#xD;
"It is well ; lie is used to looking upon death&#xD;
--to him it is not terrible."&#xD;
"Madam, madam, do not excite yourself,"&#xD;
said the physician, kindly, as he and Luona&#xD;
stood by the bedside ; while the fitful flashes of&#xD;
lightning, rolling out from the black clouds,&#xD;
threw a flickering and ghastly light upon the&#xD;
scene.&#xD;
Excite myself ?" she cried, with  fierce&#xD;
energy, as she hall-rose from her couch. " Know&#xD;
you not that I am dying ?"&#xD;
The exertion was too much forher. Pale and&#xD;
quivering, she sunk back upon the couch.&#xD;
Bring a light quickly," said the doctor, as&#xD;
he hastened to offer the invalid a strengthening&#xD;
cordial.&#xD;
"No! no !" moaned the dying woman; "my&#xD;
lamp is going out-the oih-is spent!1"&#xD;
Luona, who had hurried out for a light, now&#xD;
returned, and scarcely could she  repress a&#xD;
scream as she saw the sudden and the fearful&#xD;
change which had come over her mother's&#xD;
face. The eyes were fixed-already the fea-&#xD;
tures seemed rigid.  She clasped the hand&#xD;
which, nerveless, hung over the bedside. It&#xD;
was cold as ice.&#xD;
"0, doctor, is this death " she moaned.&#xD;
A  deafening burst of thunder, shook the&#xD;
house to its foundation, while  a blinding&#xD;
flash of light suffused the room, drowning his&#xD;
reply. The blue lips gasped once, once only,&#xD;
while the reverberative thunder rolled away;&#xD;
there was a shuddering motion of that slender&#xD;
form, then all was still, within and without.&#xD;
The doctor was the first to break Lime silence,&#xD;
as he looked upon her who lay so cold upon the&#xD;
couch, and then on the orphan who knelt be-&#xD;
side it.&#xD;
4 Poor child 1" said he, with deep emotion,&#xD;
"your mother will suffer no more ; she is&#xD;
dead !"&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
LUONA PRESCOTT; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
TBE CURSE&#xD;
Then, in great drops, rolled out the rain of&#xD;
grief from Luona's cloud-like eyes, and as if&#xD;
Heaven felt a sympathy, its thunders ceased,&#xD;
and down from its gloomy concave came the&#xD;
unchecked torrents of the storm, drenching the.&#xD;
dry earth, stripping the proud flower-stems,&#xD;
bowing the green branches low toward the&#xD;
ground.&#xD;
The doctor did not try to check her tears.&#xD;
lie knew that her heart would be the lighter that&#xD;
they were shed. It is only tearless grief-the&#xD;
sorrow that knows no utterance-which kills!&#xD;
He called the only servant which they kept,&#xD;
and saying that lie would send others to assist&#xD;
in watching and preparing the body for burial,&#xD;
and himself give such orders for the funeral as&#xD;
were necessary, he bade Luoni-who, amid her&#xD;
sobs, thanked him-a tender good-night and&#xD;
departed.&#xD;
CIIAPTER II.&#xD;
inK MILITARY DRILL UPON THE VILLAGE GREF.N,&#xD;
AND TiHE FUNERAL.&#xD;
The sun rose brightly on he next morning,&#xD;
and smiling upon the crushed and weeping&#xD;
flowers, bade them raise their heads again.&#xD;
And a gentle breeze came softly among them,&#xD;
and swept away their tears, and shook the bend-&#xD;
ing branches until they laughed and shone&#xD;
brightly in the cheerful sunlight. And as it&#xD;
rolled up its azure pathway, the grass rose&#xD;
greenly from the steaming earth, and all things&#xD;
looked more lovely even for the storm that had&#xD;
come and gone.&#xD;
There was a pretty scene upon the village&#xD;
green, shortly before that sun reached its me-&#xD;
ridian altitude. It was a comely band of stal-&#xD;
wart young men, ranging from the ages of&#xD;
eighteen to twenty-five years, all clad in a neat&#xD;
and tasty uniform, drawn up in line with a&#xD;
steadiness and precision which would have won&#xD;
praise from veterans, and which spoke well of&#xD;
the skill and discipline of their young com-&#xD;
mander, whose erect form, voice, clear as a&#xD;
bugle, flashing eye, and martial tread, betoken-&#xD;
ed him a soldier, every inch.&#xD;
Their banner was a pine tree, upon a white&#xD;
ground ; at its root a coiled rattlesnake; and&#xD;
over it these words: "Touch me and I shrike !"&#xD;
Their music consisted of a fife, small and bass&#xD;
drums, and though not quite so noisy as our&#xD;
brazen bands of the present day, still was suf-&#xD;
ficiently inspiring for those whose hearts were&#xD;
already alight with martial fire.&#xD;
A crowd of the village people, and all of the&#xD;
boys of the little town and its neighborhood&#xD;
were assembled to witness the drill, evolutions,&#xD;
and marchings of the company, which were&#xD;
sufficiently creditable to call forth open and&#xD;
hearty encomiums from several old veterans.&#xD;
who had served in the times of Braddock and&#xD;
of Wolfe, against the French ; and who, old&#xD;
though they were, undisguisedly were looking&#xD;
to an almost surely impending rupture with the&#xD;
mother country, which would again bring them&#xD;
&#xD;
7&#xD;
&#xD;
FULFILLED.                               6&#xD;
under arms-for that lovely village was a home&#xD;
of patriots, even though it was its fate to nurse&#xD;
and nestle one traitor to his native land within&#xD;
its bosom.&#xD;
"Your men drill well, Benedict. How do you&#xD;
think they'd stand fire ?" asked one of those&#xD;
old veterans, as he approached the young com-&#xD;
mander, who had brought his men to "a rest"&#xD;
for a few moments.&#xD;
"Like salamanders, major-like salamanders,"&#xD;
replied young Arnold, with enthusiasm.&#xD;
"They're a likely-looking set o' lads," con-&#xD;
tinued the old man. "It puts me in mind of&#xD;
Louisburg to look at 'em."&#xD;
"Who is dead ?" asked Arnold, pointing to a&#xD;
funeral cortege, which was slowly approaching&#xD;
-for the way to the village burying-ground lay&#xD;
in a direction which led it past the green.&#xD;
"I heard that the Widow Prescott had died&#xD;
last night; but they seem in a hurry to put&#xD;
her under round," said the old man.&#xD;
" Attention, company I shoulder arms! right&#xD;
dress ! front ! order arms I"&#xD;
These rapid orders broiliht the company&#xD;
from the negligence of a position at "rest" to&#xD;
order, and as the solemn procession approached,&#xD;
the coffin, borne on a bier, supported on the&#xD;
shoulders of men, the young officer, in a low&#xD;
tone, gave the order, "Uncover !"&#xD;
In a moment, every plulmed hat was doffed,&#xD;
and the surrounding crowd, struck with the act&#xD;
of respect, also remembered their hats.&#xD;
There were not many who followed the wid-&#xD;
ow's corpse to the grave : for in life she had&#xD;
been cold and distant, and had made but few&#xD;
friends. And to those who knew how bitterly&#xD;
she had hated and persecuted Lemuel Ar-&#xD;
nold, the res pect which Benedict now showed&#xD;
to her funeral train seemed singular.&#xD;
By the side of the minister, leaning on his&#xD;
arm, and walking by the side of the coffin, was&#xD;
Luona, looking more tall and stately than ever,&#xD;
in her long and trailing robes of mourning.&#xD;
And her face, pale from sorrow, looked very&#xD;
beautiful in its snowy contrast, with eyes and&#xD;
tresses dark as night.&#xD;
The minister, who noted the respectful posi-&#xD;
tion of the company, and of the crowd which&#xD;
had gathered about it, said something to the fair&#xD;
mourner, whose tearful eyes had been bent to-&#xD;
ward the ground. She looked up, and as her&#xD;
glance met that of Arnold, her cheeks, before&#xD;
so deathly pale, suddenly reddened with a&#xD;
crimson blush, and for an instant she seemed&#xD;
fearfully agitated: But quick as a transient&#xD;
sun-gleam, glancing through the opening&#xD;
clouds, it passed away, and she was as pale&#xD;
and as calm as before ; yet not so quickly but&#xD;
that Arnold's eagle eyeh ad noticed the change,&#xD;
and thought it strange. lIe had seen her more&#xD;
than once before, and marked her wonderful&#xD;
beauty, and not even sought to make her no-&#xD;
quaintance ; but her mother, stern and cold to&#xD;
all the world but her, had kept too close a watch&#xD;
for that.&#xD;

&#xD;
Yet his society was sought by more than one&#xD;
of the fair maidens of that town-for he was&#xD;
handsome and gallant in his bearing, though&#xD;
rumor often told a tale of his fondness for the&#xD;
wine-cup. and the midnight card-party, and of&#xD;
gallartries which were not linked with honor.&#xD;
How strange it is that these latter errors find&#xD;
excuse with the tL'ntler sex, if committed by a&#xD;
man, yet are so unforgivingly considered if&#xD;
they emanate from a female!&#xD;
The 1 ruc'sion passed on, and soon disa.-&#xD;
peared aiil dthe thick growth of elms, which,&#xD;
with drooping  branches, overshadowed the&#xD;
graveyard ; and the young offileer resumed his&#xD;
drill a~ai.Ilhut his heart dlid not seem so in-&#xD;
tent upon the business as it had been before,&#xD;
and soon, with a few words of thanks to his&#xD;
companiei, and naming the day when they&#xD;
were to reassemble for exercise, he dismissed&#xD;
them.&#xD;
"Mother "said lie, as a few minutes after-&#xD;

"No, nther. I but saw her as she followed&#xD;

thouglihtm ran that way. She looked very beau-&#xD;

" Thue pr cinll ins reason for sadness. 'Tis&#xD;

There-« a- mare harsh news from Boston,&#xD;
to-day,mt   , her ! said the young man, sudden-&#xD;
ly chanmtheint suiject.&#xD;
" Iies! Wt4hat was it, my son?"&#xD;
" More o prcesion and more wrong.   The&#xD;
king, thurougzhi his despotic servants here, seems&#xD;
determined to drive his colonies into open re-&#xD;
bellion; and if lie does, then he may bid fare-&#xD;
well to his rule here forever!"&#xD;
"Nonense, my son. What could our peo-&#xD;
ple, thinly scattered over a vast territory, with-&#xD;
out discipline. and but feebly armed, do in re-&#xD;
bellion against a king, whose veteran armies,&#xD;
&#xD;
numbering thousands where we count tens,&#xD;
could be thrown like an avalanche upon our&#xD;
shores !"&#xD;
"Mother, right makes might!    That our&#xD;
people are thinly scattered over a vast terri-&#xD;
tory, is true; but his troops will have to scat-&#xD;
ter to find them. And what will discipline-&#xD;
avail, when death lurks in every bush, behind&#xD;
every rock, and wall, and tree. So surely as&#xD;
war is forced upon us, then will these colonies&#xD;
he free-free from the rule of a bad man and a&#xD;
tyrant !"&#xD;
" Ihush, my son; even walls have ears, 'tis&#xD;
said ; such words might bring persecution&#xD;
upon you!''&#xD;
"Let it come! Were the king upon this spot,&#xD;
I would not eat my words !"&#xD;
"Ah, Benedict, Benedict, you were ever a&#xD;
willful boy!"&#xD;
"But not disrespectful to my mother. I now&#xD;
only echo the feelings of discontent with the&#xD;
government which, each day, grows stronger&#xD;
through the land. ' New rules, heavier taxes,&#xD;
moure tyrants to enforce them,' is the cry&#xD;
everywhere. It is to prepare for a struggle,&#xD;
which seems inevitable, that I drill my com-&#xD;
pany so constantly-for that, that I pore daily&#xD;
and nightly over the military books that I have&#xD;
purchased.  Mother, if a war should break&#xD;
out, I will he a general or I will perish&#xD;
The mother smiled at the earnestness of her&#xD;
son; but tiers was a smile of pride--for she had&#xD;
a patriot heart in her bosom, and lie was all in&#xD;
all t her. God had left her no other comfort.&#xD;
"Every upward step you take will bring joy&#xD;
to ie, Benedict!" said ste. "But let there be&#xD;
no rust upon the rounds of your ladder. Let&#xD;
honorthe your guide ;for that fame is infamy,&#xD;
upon which dishonor casts a single shadow !"&#xD;
"Do you suppose that Luona Prescott will&#xD;
still live in her mother's cottage, with only&#xD;
that old housekeper to guard her ?" asked Ar-&#xD;
nld, changing back to his former subject as&#xD;
sui denly as he had left it.&#xD;
How should I know, who have had no inti-&#xD;
macy with her, or, during life, with her mother?"&#xD;
naked Mrs. Arnold. "It is strange," she added,&#xD;
earnestly, " that this girl should so much ucen-&#xD;
py your mind to-day !"&#xD;
"Not strange, when I have but just come&#xD;
from looking at her in her grief, while she fol-&#xD;
lowed her mother's corpse to the tomb!' said&#xD;
Arnold, quietly ; and then he went to a table by&#xD;
the window and took up a book,&#xD;
But the book did not much seem to occupy&#xD;
his attention, for his eyes were frequently raised&#xD;
from it, and he would look out through the&#xD;
sweet-briar vines and honeysuckles which&#xD;
were trained up over a lattice, outside-of his&#xD;
own manufactare-look out upon the broad and&#xD;
well-shaded street, and down toward the river,&#xD;
where he could see, traced in thread-like lines&#xD;
against the distant sky, the rigging and taper-&#xD;
iug spars of the vessels which lay at their&#xD;
moorings there-&#xD;

THE CURSE F&#xD;
Perhaps he was wondering why Luona blush-&#xD;
ed and paled so suddenly when her eyes met&#xD;
his that day. He had met her before, more&#xD;
than once, and boldly gazed upon her lovely&#xD;
face and form ; but she had coldly passed, as&#xD;
if she  neither knew  nor cared to know&#xD;
who or what lie was ; and though he often turn-&#xD;
ed to look at her when she had gone by, her&#xD;
head was never turned to get a second glance&#xD;
at him.&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
THE LEADING OP TIS WILI-THE PULPIT VrCrus&#xD;
PILLS.&#xD;
The last sad offices had been rendered to the&#xD;
dead, and Luona Prescott had returned to her&#xD;
gloomy home-for to her auch it was ; the light&#xD;
which had shone for her since her infancy, had&#xD;
departed forever.&#xD;
"Don't give up to sadness, young mistress,"&#xD;
said the old servant, or housekeeper-who had&#xD;
been in the family ever since Luona could re-&#xD;
member. "Whatever is, is God's doing, and&#xD;
we can't help it: and they say, that is, good&#xD;
folks say, that we've no right to grumble at it,&#xD;
though I haven't learning enough to see the&#xD;
reason or sense of that."&#xD;
"You have a brother, I believe, Barbara. I&#xD;
think I saw him here once 1" said Luona, not&#xD;
seeming to heed the words of the old woman.&#xD;
"A half-brother, Miss Lona !" replied Bar-&#xD;
bara, who had a Yankee faculty of shortening&#xD;
names. "lie lives over in Sharon ; his name&#xD;
is Elnathan Goodrich. He's two years older&#xD;
than I be!"&#xD;
"Do you think he'd like to come here and&#xD;
live with us? I feel now that we need the pro-&#xD;
tection of a man in the house, and he could at-&#xD;
tend to the garden!"&#xD;
"Yes, and do a heap of other chores !" cried&#xD;
Barbara. "Yes, indeed, Miss Lone, he'd like&#xD;
to come, I'm sure I He's most too old to be&#xD;
working out at day's work here and there, as he&#xD;
is doing now. It you'll let me send for him,&#xD;
I'll warrant he'll come in a jiffy, and thankyou&#xD;
for the char. , and ask nothing but his victuals&#xD;
and clothes !"&#xD;
"You can send for him as soon as you like."&#xD;
replied the orphan. "And, Barbara, put our&#xD;
little parlor in order ; I have requested Dr.&#xD;
Griswold, and Mr. Everett, the minister, to&#xD;
come here this evening. They were friends of&#xD;
my mother, and her will must be opened ; and&#xD;
it is also proper that I should look to them for&#xD;
advice ; though Heaven knows, if they advise&#xD;
aught that does not suit my will, I shall not&#xD;
heed it, I am my own mistress now, and mean&#xD;
ever to remain so."&#xD;
"So say all young girls ; but when a roper&#xD;
mate comes along, they change their minds, and&#xD;
right gladly take a master to their hearts,"&#xD;
said the garrulous old woman.&#xD;
"I shall be an exception," said Luona.&#xD;
"But do as I bade you, Barbara; they will&#xD;
soon be here."&#xD;
&#xD;
L&#xD;
&#xD;
ULFILLED.                              7&#xD;
The grief of that lovely girl, so violent at&#xD;
first, had subsided into a calm, submissive sor-&#xD;
row; yet it was not the less deep for its quiet.&#xD;
She was firm ; for she knew her loss was irre-&#xD;
trievable, and that thenceforth she must act for&#xD;
herself. And she felt that she had a mission&#xD;
before her which would require more than the&#xD;
common strength of woman to execute; but&#xD;
she had sworn to her dying mother that she&#xD;
would fulfill it, and she did not mean to break&#xD;
her oath.&#xD;
The minister and his friend, the doctor, we'e&#xD;
both pleased to find her so resigned, when they&#xD;
came in the evening, for both attributed it to&#xD;
their own influence and counsels-not even giv-&#xD;
ing her credit for the strong will and stern self-&#xD;
control which she really possessed.&#xD;
After they were seated, Barbara was called&#xD;
in, and the will produced, opened, and read-by&#xD;
the minister. Luona, who never had asked&#xD;
her mother a question about her property, was&#xD;
surprised to find herself the possessor not only&#xD;
of the house and lot where she lived, and a&#xD;
small farm near by-which her mother had&#xD;
leased to a worthy farmer-but also of sixty&#xD;
thousand dollars in cash, well-secured -in&#xD;
those days, a fortune indeed. An annuity of&#xD;
two hundred dollars per year was left to Bar-&#xD;
bara so long-as she should remain with Lugna.&#xD;
"Dear soul," said the good housekeeper,&#xD;
"she needn't have done that. I never should&#xD;
have left Lona at any rate."&#xD;
"Although a witness to her signature tothis&#xD;
will, I little dreamed of the amount your dear&#xD;
mother had left," said the doctor.&#xD;
"What an opportunity to distinguish your-&#xD;
self in deeds of charity I'said the minister.&#xD;
"Yes, with the twentieth part of it you&#xD;
could build a marine hospital, and every sailor&#xD;
who came sick into port would bless you,"&#xD;
cried the doctor.&#xD;
"It were better expended in building a&#xD;
church, and then God would bless her," cried&#xD;
the minister. "Our old meeting-house is be-&#xD;
coming really shabby."&#xD;
" Pahaw ! a hospital is more needed. Your&#xD;
church members are rich enough to build a&#xD;
new  meeting-house whenever they want it,"&#xD;
cried the doctor.&#xD;
"You needn't pshaw me, Dr. Griswold,"&#xD;
cried the minister, reddening with anger. "I&#xD;
know that,in your ungodliness, you are opposed&#xD;
to the advancement of the Gospel; but you&#xD;
can't induce Miss Prescott to give you money&#xD;
to build up a rotten hospital for a lot of swear&#xD;
ing, drinking, graceless, sailors, who are no bet,&#xD;
ter than you are."&#xD;
"They're a thundering sightbetter than you,&#xD;
at any rate, you whining old milk-sop," cried&#xD;
the doctor, fairly blue with wrath. "Miss&#xD;
Prescott knows well enough what an old beg.&#xD;
gar you tre."&#xD;
"-Dr. Griswold, if I were not a preacher, I'd-&#xD;
-I'd smite you."&#xD;
"Do it if you dare, Jim Everett, I licked&#xD;

LUONA PRESCOT; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
you when you were a school-boy, and I can do&#xD;
it again. if it wasn't for your black coat, I'd&#xD;
give you a dose now."&#xD;
"I can lay aside my coat, Dr. Griswold."&#xD;
"Do it, Mr. Everett."&#xD;
Seeing that a combat was almost inevitable,&#xD;
Luona, who, in spite of the grief which lay so&#xD;
heavily at her heart, could scarcely keep from&#xD;
laughing at this ludicrous scene, now inter-&#xD;
ferred.&#xD;
" Gentlemen," said she, with calm dignity,&#xD;
"I hope that, if you do forget the respectabili-&#xD;
ty of your professions, you will yet remember&#xD;
that you are in the presence of a lady."&#xD;
Her words fell like oil upon troubled water.&#xD;
Both of the disputants cooled down and apolo-&#xD;
gized for their rudeness,&#xD;
"If I should make up my mind to use a&#xD;
portion of this large sum-&#xD;
To build a hospital," suggested the doctor.&#xD;
"A church," cried the minister.&#xD;
"If I should make up my mind to use any&#xD;
of my money in either of the projects which&#xD;
you have named," continued Luona, smiling at&#xD;
their interruption, "I will let you knows. At&#xD;
present, I have no such intention."&#xD;
" Umph !" growled the doctor, looking as if&#xD;
he had been forced to swallow one of his own&#xD;
pills.&#xD;
" Ah !" said the reverend, looking upward, as&#xD;
if to in7oke a change of mind on her part.&#xD;
"Barbara will bring you a glass of wine,&#xD;
gentlemen, and I beg that you will excuse me,&#xD;
for I am very weary. Let me hope that you&#xD;
will reconcile your differences, however, before&#xD;
you part," said the orphan ; and then, with a&#xD;
graceful inclination, she retired.&#xD;
Barbara quickly brought the wine, for she&#xD;
had been sadly terrified during the foreoging&#xD;
scene.&#xD;
"James," said the doctor, as he reached out&#xD;
his right hand, the left holding a full wine-&#xD;
glass.&#xD;
"Samuel':" said the minister, as he grasped&#xD;
the ext ended hand, while his eyes were almost&#xD;
as full as his glass-and that was running over.&#xD;
" here's to yo', James ; and let all be for.&#xD;
given and fajgotten," continued the doctor.&#xD;
Amen, Samuel!" said the minister, and&#xD;
then they emptied their glasses, and afterward&#xD;
they embraced.&#xD;
Then they refilled their glasses, and sat down&#xD;
and talked of their school-boy days, of their&#xD;
'l1 plsys, sweethearts, bird-nestings, etc., etc.,&#xD;
washing away the mist of memory with the&#xD;
choice old wine, until they had finished the&#xD;
bottle. Then they rose to go.&#xD;
Behold how good it is for brethren to dwell&#xD;
in unity together I" said the pastor to Bar-&#xD;
bara, as arns-in-arm with the doctor he crossed&#xD;
tie threshold.&#xD;
" Yes, 'specially after they've been within a&#xD;
nick of blacking each other's eyes !" muttered&#xD;
the housekeeper, as she closed and double-bolt-&#xD;
ed the door&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
ARNOLD IN THE COTTAGE-ELNATIIAN OODRICI--&#xD;
A PICTURE--A MYSTERY.&#xD;
Several days elapsed after the death of Mrs.&#xD;
Prescott, and yet Luona did not stir abroad,&#xD;
though formerly she was seen daily strolling&#xD;
along the lovely walks, which even yet charac-&#xD;
terize that beautiful place. But there were&#xD;
unny calls made at the cottage, by neighbors&#xD;
suddenly grown. sympathetic, since they had&#xD;
heard, through the Reverend Mr. Everett and&#xD;
l)octor Griswold, how much wealth had been&#xD;
left to lie. But Barbara received all of these&#xD;
calls, for Luona, seeing through the motives&#xD;
which induced them, sent word that she was&#xD;
too unwell to see company. Yet she made an&#xD;
exception, and one which more surprised Bar-&#xD;
bara than any other act which she had ever&#xD;
known her young mistress to com'nit.&#xD;
One morning, nearly a week after the funeral,&#xD;
the housekeeper hurried into the sitting-room,&#xD;
and said&#xD;
"0 Miss Lona, who do you think is coming&#xD;
up the lane toward the house ?"&#xD;
" how can I know until you tell me, Bar-&#xD;
bara ?"&#xD;
"Why, Miss Lona, it's that good-for-noth-&#xD;
ing scapegrace, Benedict Arnold !"&#xD;
Ah !" and the color went and came, as it&#xD;
had before, upon the face of the beautiful girl.&#xD;
"Oh, don't be scared, Miss Lona," said the&#xD;
housekeeper; "I won't let him in. I'd as soon&#xD;
open the door to a tiger-I'll tell him you don't&#xD;
want to see him, or any of his kind."&#xD;
"You will do no such thing, Barbara !" said&#xD;
her mistress. "If lie asks for me, you will in.&#xD;
vite him politely into the parlor, and say to&#xD;
him that I will join him directly."&#xD;
"Miss Lona, la sakes! Be you in right-&#xD;
down earnest ?" cried Barbara, opening both&#xD;
eyes and mouth to an unusual extent.&#xD;
"Yes, do as I bid you ; and when I go into&#xD;
the parlor, come you also in, and busy yourself&#xD;
about something during my interview with&#xD;
him."&#xD;
Did you ever !" exclaimed the housekeeper,&#xD;
raising both hands.&#xD;
"Go to the door ; do you not hear the&#xD;
knocker ?" said Luona, sharply, although she&#xD;
was half-inclined to laugh at the oddity Bar-&#xD;
bara displayed.&#xD;
"The creetur is in the parlor, Miss Lona,"&#xD;
said the housekeeper, as she soon after re-enter-&#xD;
ed the room.&#xD;
"Very well ; as soon as I have arranged my&#xD;
toilet, I will see him," replied Luona.&#xD;
"Goodness me I she didn't fix herself up a bit&#xD;
for the minister nor the doctor. What is agoin'&#xD;
to happen ?" said Barbara to herself.&#xD;
In a few moments, Luona, accompanied by&#xD;
the housekeeper, entered the parlor, where she&#xD;
found Arnold standing before a portrait of her-&#xD;
self, which her mother had caused to be paint-&#xD;
ed a couple of years before. Hearing the&#xD;
rustle of her dress he turned and bowel low,&#xD;

THE ARRIVAL AT CAaMnIJD(iE, AND TILE WELCOME--&#xD;
A COLONEL S COMMISSION AND WORK AHEAD-&#xD;
ELNATIiAN AN) HIS HORSE.&#xD;
'the arrival of young Arnold and his small&#xD;
force was hailed with delight at Cambridge.&#xD;
Not that men were scarce-for patriots were&#xD;
hurryimg im, in immense numbers, from every&#xD;
side-but because lie looked and seemed to be&#xD;
an ofitcer of skill, and his men were well drilled&#xD;
and disciplined. Not a corps in the young&#xD;
armia could vie with them upon this point ; and&#xD;
the Matssachiusetts council at once ctonferred the&#xD;
raik of colonel upon Iiti, ant increased his&#xD;
ranks front their own volunteers-for the conti-&#xD;
nental army was not yet organized, nor had&#xD;
Vashington taken the comniand.&#xD;
Olicers, at that era, who understood military&#xD;
tactics and the art of war, were very mue&#xD;
needed. Raw recruits were to be drilled into&#xD;
preparation to meet veterans, who had been led&#xD;
to victory on many a Europeann attle-field -&#xD;
and who were ith byoflicers that had been&#xD;
reared, frot childhood u, in the camp.&#xD;
Attoldlanti ever   otfheer there found that&#xD;
they thinlemough todo to endeavor to produce&#xD;
aiythiig like orer atongst the heterogeneous&#xD;
mass assembled--armed with every conceiv-&#xD;
able weapon, wviitioutunifoirrmity of dress, and&#xD;
as iidelendent as if each individual ws a gene-&#xD;
ral, at the lowest calculation.&#xD;
Ye-t ranonttr hemttrthere wssone uniformity&#xD;
it was their' biiiei-hatred to British oppression&#xD;
-their united deteruminattion to resist it to the&#xD;
death&#xD;
Otto thing was much wanted in the American&#xD;
camp-artillery and its necessary ammunition.&#xD;
They were besieging a regular army in Boston,&#xD;
which was well provided with stores and arms&#xD;
of every'kind; an  which, providentially for&#xD;
tiert, did rtt scon  to knowtheir weakness, or&#xD;
at least refrtained from mairking a general sally&#xD;
-atohich, at such a time, would have been very&#xD;
apt to e successful. Tie English govern men&#xD;
very heavily condemned that inactivity in their&#xD;
generals and veterans, which allowed an army&#xD;
of men, not half armed or provided with warlike&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CURSE F&#xD;
munitions, to organize, form lines of defences,&#xD;
and eventually, under Washington, to force&#xD;
their evacuation from Boston, when they could"&#xD;
have been so easily crushed at first. Yet when&#xD;
we consider what a terrible lesson they had so&#xD;
recently received at Bunker Hill, it can hardly&#xD;
be a matter of wonder that they should be cau-&#xD;
tious.&#xD;
Arnold --whose ambition, even then, was&#xD;
boundless, saw this great need of having artil-&#xD;
lery; and having noticed, in several trading&#xD;
trips which he had made to Canada, before tie&#xD;
war, the careless state of defence of some of the&#xD;
frontier forts, his active mind suggested the&#xD;
capture of these, with their artillery and muni,&#xD;
tions. lie laid his plans before the Massachu&#xD;
setts Council, or Committee of Safety-for thoe&#xD;
Continental Congress was not yet organia&#xD;
and they were received with immense favor.&#xD;
To rmake the expedition successful, it'd&#xD;
deemed inexpedient to send any troops away&#xD;
froni Cambridge ; lest the enemy, suspecting&#xD;
their destination, would "express" the news to&#xD;
Canada,haud give the forces there time for prep-&#xD;
aration and defence. The secret was carefully&#xD;
kept; and Arnold, with orders from them to&#xD;
raise four hundred men in the western part of&#xD;
the colony on his route, started with a small&#xD;
retinue of eight or ten officers and servants on&#xD;
his emission. IIe left the camp in the night, and&#xD;
none but those who were chief in power knew&#xD;
of his absence, or at least of its cause.&#xD;
But others there were who had ambition and&#xD;
patriotism also, and whose eyes had also sighted&#xD;
the prizes to be had at Ticonderoga and Crown&#xD;
Point. The colony of Connecticut had sent a&#xD;
commission thitherward ; and  Ethan Allen,&#xD;
with a band of brave Green Mountain boys, was&#xD;
hastening forward, even before Arnold left&#xD;
Cambridge.&#xD;
The latter heard of this only after he had&#xD;
started, and ie pushed forward with all pos-&#xD;
sible speed, not waiting to enlist men ; for he&#xD;
heard that Allen and Warner had got men&#xD;
enough together, and lie supposed that ,his&#xD;
commission fromt the Massachusetts council&#xD;
would give him the command, and that Allen&#xD;
and lus men would at once acknowledge his&#xD;
rank and obey his orders.&#xD;
The speed with which the young officer&#xD;
traveled was rather annoying to his attendants,&#xD;
who had not then got used to such " break-neck&#xD;
work ;" but his spirit then, as afterwards, leap-&#xD;
ed over all obstacles ; and he spurred forward,&#xD;
night and day, despite their. groans and com-&#xD;
plaints.&#xD;
One there was who would appear to be, more&#xD;
than all the rest, liable to suffering-he was so&#xD;
sharp-boned, angular, and thin-fleshed, and so&#xD;
encumbered with his long gun and sabre-yet&#xD;
no complaint came from the lips of our whilom&#xD;
friend, Elnathan Goodrich, chief valet and&#xD;
body-guard to Colonel Arnold. Mounted on a&#xD;
very hiugh, raw-boned, and solemn-looking horse&#xD;
--which, from its length of legs alone, looked as&#xD;
&#xD;
ULFILLED.                               17&#xD;
if speed must be in them-he rode on as seri-&#xD;
ously as if the weight of the nation's weal, or&#xD;
woe was settled upon his shoulders. He never&#xD;
smiled, and seldom spoke ; but when he did, he&#xD;
always said something so dry and peculiar, that&#xD;
it brought many a laugh from those who heard&#xD;
him.&#xD;
""mAre you no tIred, Elnathan 2" asked Ar-&#xD;
nold, one even' , after they had gone some&#xD;
forty miles witout  halti&#xD;
"Be yo   w     lie -'reply, Yankee-tiely&#xD;

; .:CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
AND THE GREEN MOUNTAIN BOYS.&#xD;
right May morning-the 9th day of&#xD;
that onth, 1775, when Arnold and his jaded&#xD;
servants and friends, only ten in number, after&#xD;
riding all night, arrived at Castleton, and drew&#xD;
up before a little tavern in that place. Their&#xD;
horses were worn down, and the riders, covered&#xD;
with dust, did not seem to be in much better&#xD;
condition.&#xD;
The young officer, who, as was usually his&#xD;
case, was very particular in his personal appear-&#xD;
ance, passed in at once, followed by Elnathan,&#xD;
with his portmanteau, and inquired fora private&#xD;
room, in which to change his apparel. This was&#xD;
a difficult thing to get, for the house was full of&#xD;
company, and the small village seeded crowded&#xD;
with people. But room was finally got for&#xD;
the purpose ; and in a short time, Col. Arnold&#xD;
reappeared in all the glory of clean linen and&#xD;
a new Continental uniform, looking as Elnathan&#xD;
said, "as nice as a new pin."&#xD;
He then condescended to inquire what was&#xD;
the cause of such a large concourse of people&#xD;
in the village, lie was informed by the land-&#xD;
lord that'Colonels Allen and Warner were there&#xD;
with a body of militia, which they had collect-&#xD;
ed, and were going somewhere or other to fight&#xD;
the British, or so he "reckoned."&#xD;
"I should like to see Colonel Allen!" said&#xD;
Arnold.&#xD;
"There he stands, talking to them men&#xD;
there!I" said the landlord, pointing to a tall,&#xD;
rough-looking, red-faced man, dressed very&#xD;
plainly, and looking as though he had just come&#xD;
from a plaw-field. "I'll call him. Hey,&#xD;
Colonel Allen ---here's a feller wants to see&#xD;
you!"&#xD;
Arnold. rather choked at being considered a&#xD;
"feller," nor did he much like the little respect&#xD;
exhibited in Allen's reply, who said:&#xD;
"Tell him to hold on till I get through with&#xD;
the boys here, and then I'l see him!"&#xD;
The young colonel did "hold on," but rather&#xD;
impatiently, for, deeming himself the superior&#xD;
of the other in every way, and naturally of an&#xD;
imperious disposition, he felt himself almost&#xD;
insulted by such treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
old chaps down at Boston wouldn't have made&#xD;

Arnold was now introduced to Warner and&#xD;
other officers; and though his proud and ambi-&#xD;
tions spirit wus bitterly chafed by his peculiar&#xD;
position, he restrainedtin exhibition of his feel-&#xD;
ings, and endeavored by his sociability to erad-&#xD;
icate any symptoms of antipathy which his&#xD;
first appearance and conduct might have creat-&#xD;
ed toward lin on their parts. In this he tol-&#xD;
erally well succeeded-for they were plain,&#xD;
warmi-hearted people, unused to the mts of dis'&#xD;
simulation, and as such, not calculated to hold&#xD;
malice or feel undue prejudice. Thus the day&#xD;
wor.on ph-asantly, and with perfect unanimnity&#xD;
the arrangements for the expedition were made,&#xD;
for 'T'iconderoga was near, only across a narrow&#xD;
portion of the lake, within a few hours' imnareh ;&#xD;
4 the gathering of Allen's men had been so&#xD;
aMden, and yet so secret, that his destination&#xD;
was not suspected : in truth, it was openly&#xD;
supposed that the Cuntinental camp, in tint of&#xD;
Bostii, was the place to which they meant to&#xD;
march.&#xD;

tiiy hgao to leave town in small parties, hay-&#xD;
ing directions to meet at a precincerted ren-&#xD;
d-zvou, from whence they were to advance by&#xD;
a rapid, :urced march to the )lace where hioats&#xD;
had len oilered to lie collected, ready for their&#xD;
eiiibarkaion. The night w-as dull ai'd drizzly,&#xD;
and nut the best for travel, but served the double&#xD;
purpose of conceding their movements and&#xD;
keeping stragtgling people, who iad no business&#xD;
abroad, at home. It was but little after mid-&#xD;
iight, when A len with the advance, accompani-&#xD;
ed iy Arnotd and his scanty suite, reached the&#xD;
position opposite the fort, from which they in-&#xD;
tended to embark. But the difficulty was to&#xD;
get boats for the crossing . Not enough to cross&#xD;
more than seventy or eighty could he got. But&#xD;
Allen was the last main the world to tarn&#xD;
back when lie started, the last to lit any ob-&#xD;

persevering as ever Arnold was, and no one&#xD;
could lie more so&#xD;
So, with a young man for a guide who knew&#xD;

Allen anti a picked body of men embarked in&#xD;

But the dawn was already streaking the east,&#xD;
when they, numbering altogether only about&#xD;

eventually to be sustained in his position, not&#xD;
only by the Council but by Congress.&#xD;
When Arnold found himself at the head of a&#xD;
company which really acknowledged him as&#xD;
leader, the tire of ambition and the embers of&#xD;
disappointment which had rankled so fiercely&#xD;
in his bosom, began to burn anew; and again&#xD;
praduing his commission, he demanded to be&#xD;
considered as the commander-in-chief of the&#xD;
fortresses and forces on the frontiers.&#xD;
"Young man, you had better' o back to&#xD;

- Seeing that you have no authority,  _&#xD;

eincher to his remark.&#xD;
"The day will soon come, sir, when you will&#xD;
have to know ue as your superior !" said Ar-&#xD;
nll. In the meiantimre, I'll-"'&#xD;
" Well, what will you do " asked Allen, see-&#xD;
ing that Arnold hesitated.&#xD;
" (o and win laurels while you are sleeping !"&#xD;
raid Arnold, bitterly.&#xD;
" don't ! you are green enough now !" said&#xD;
Allen, tauntmngly.&#xD;
Colonel, jest you let rue take that old chap&#xD;
down a leetle '" said Elnathan, at this juncture;&#xD;
for he was indignant at seeing his master snub-&#xD;
bed in that way.&#xD;
"Silence, sii'! vou have other business to at-&#xD;
tend to !" said Arnold, sternly. Then, turning&#xD;
to one of his own officers, he bade him muster&#xD;
his own men, and make ready for an expedition.&#xD;
This done, he turned abruptly away from&#xD;
Allen, and went to his own quarters.&#xD;
That night he encamped some distance down&#xD;
the lake from the fort ; and sent out to pur-&#xD;
chase boats, wherever they could be found. He&#xD;
told no one of his plans or destination; but&#xD;
seemed bent on some desperate enterprise which&#xD;
should throw Allen's successful but bloodless&#xD;
capture in the shade. And he wanted some-&#xD;
thing to occupy him, and keep him apart from&#xD;
Allen until he had received an answer from the&#xD;
authorities to his protest ; for he felt assured&#xD;
that the Marsachusetts Council would insist up-&#xD;
on his commission being respected.&#xD;
Though his men, wearied from a rap'd.march,&#xD;
slept, excepting only his sentinels, Arnold was&#xD;
awake ; and for hours paced to and fro along&#xD;
the beach, waiting for his boats, attended only&#xD;
by Elnathan, who could not be induced to leave&#xD;
him. He had "promised Miss Lony to stick&#xD;
by him," he said ; "and darn him into pewter&#xD;
buttons if he wouldn't !"&#xD;
Shortly after midnight, a schooner, or yacht,&#xD;
which had belonged to Major Skene, of Skenes-&#xD;
boro'-a story, whose "good advice" contributed&#xD;
afterward more to the defeat of Burgoyne than&#xD;
anything else-was brought down ; and, as the&#xD;
wind was fair, Arnold at once embarked his&#xD;
men on board, and made sail for St. John's-a&#xD;
&#xD;
fortified town on the Sorel river, near the lake,&#xD;
with which he was well acquainted.&#xD;
This act was full as desperate, if not more so,&#xD;
than Allen's attack upon Ticonderoga; for Ar-&#xD;
nold had onlyabout fifty men, and the chances&#xD;
were that news had reached St. John's of the&#xD;
irruption of the Americans, and that the garri-&#xD;
son would give imu a warm reception. But the&#xD;
young leader, ever rash, did not pause to count&#xD;
the cost, or reflect upon the danger. Well ac-&#xD;
quainted with the place, he stood boldly to-&#xD;
ward it ; and, with his men concealed below,&#xD;
entered the harbor in the broad light of day.&#xD;
There lay at anchor a war sloop, and several&#xD;
smaller vessels, which he boarded and took as&#xD;
he passed ; and then landing, before .it was&#xD;
known that he was an enemy, he secured the&#xD;
rison, which consisted of a sergeant and&#xD;
ye men, without losing a man upon his side.&#xD;
Loading his vessel and the sloop with store&#xD;
from the fort--which he knew he could not&#xD;
hold with so small a force, when a heavy force&#xD;
of British was near-he hoisted sail again and&#xD;
run up the lake, before a wind which had&#xD;
chopped around in his favor.&#xD;
On the ensuing day, ie had returned to with-&#xD;
in a short distance of Ticonderuga, and the wind&#xD;
had died away into a calm, when Allen made'&#xD;
his appearance with nearly two hundred men,&#xD;
in boats, bound upon the very expedition in&#xD;
which Arnold had forestalled him.&#xD;
"Where are you from, sir ?" asked Allen,&#xD;
when he came within hail of Arnold.&#xD;
"From St. John's," was the curt reply.&#xD;
"Eli? did they drive you off?" asked the&#xD;
astonished old veteran.&#xD;
"No, sir; I took the fortoand these vessels,&#xD;
and have the garrison prisoners !" replied Ar-&#xD;
nold, delighted at the chagrin of Allen.&#xD;
"Why didn't you keep it?" asked Allen&#xD;
gruffly.&#xD;
"Because I had other fish to fry. You are&#xD;
good at garrison duty; you had better go and&#xD;
retain it, while I capture few more !"&#xD;
" Umph! it is an important post, and must&#xD;
be garrisoned !" muttered Allen, and he pro-&#xD;
ceeded on his way ; but he never reached St.&#xD;
John's. The British had gathered in force, and&#xD;
he was obliged to return to Ticonderoga with&#xD;
the loss of several men-to the great delight of&#xD;
Arnold, who hated him bitterly.&#xD;
General Carleton, who had command, in Can-&#xD;
ada, of the British forces, was utterly astound-&#xD;
ed when he heard of the surprise and capture&#xD;
of these important posts; and, instantly send-&#xD;
ing a large garrison to St. John's, ie made ac-&#xD;
tive preparations to attack and try to retake&#xD;
Ticonderoga and Crown Point, with a large&#xD;
force.&#xD;
When this news reached Arnold, he com-&#xD;
menced forming a flotilla to oppose them. He&#xD;
fully armed his schooner and slopp, also several&#xD;
boats from Crown Point, and determined to&#xD;
make a brilliant effort upon the water, and to&#xD;
attack the British before they could land. But&#xD;

his star was not in the ascendant. The repre-&#xD;

of his arrogance and assume ptions,were scli.that&#xD;
they appointed a committee of inquiry on his&#xD;
conduct. Thia so mortified and angered him,&#xD;
that he at once wrote a formal letter of resigna-&#xD;
tion, and returned to Cambridge, where lie&#xD;
found General Washington, to whom lie male&#xD;
a full report of his conduct. Such was his de-&#xD;
fence, that the gallant chief placed him imnumedi-&#xD;

Weeks, even months, had elapsed since Ar-&#xD;
nokd and his gallant company had ma.ched&#xD;
from New London, to the stirring music of i he&#xD;
fife and drum. And excepting that, when the&#xD;
mails arrived, the old mien and women, and the&#xD;

other customers, and probably considered bad&#xD;

Bnt, once in a while, when some military&#xD;
courier rode up to rest his horse, or get a mor-&#xD;
sel of food, all was ex itement until the news&#xD;
was pumped out of him ; and from Blossom's&#xD;
skill mi such matters, lie was fully entitled to&#xD;
the cognomen of Punip-laster General-albeit&#xD;
he w'as no patron of pump-water, when he could&#xD;
get and thing stronger.&#xD;
But, one evening, a few wicks after the stir-&#xD;
ring events narrated in the two preceding chap-&#xD;
ters, a tall, very military-l'ookiing man, galloped&#xD;
into town 111)011 a large tinl raw-btoned chnrger,&#xD;
built nuci upon a model with himself. There&#xD;
were holsters to his saddle, and brass-mounted&#xD;
pistols showed their butts therefromi. Ige&#xD;
spurs garnished his heels; and the sabre which&#xD;
he wore nearly touched the ground with its&#xD;
rusty iron scabbard. lisyell ow-grav hair was&#xD;
dressed neatly, and confined in a cue, which&#xD;
emerged stiffly from beneath his tri-colored hat,&#xD;
and his every look was that of a veteran ; and&#xD;
his voice, too, was gruff, as he reined up in front&#xD;
of the tavern, dismounted, took his holsters and&#xD;
portmateau from the saddl -, and said :&#xD;
"Feed this horse well, rub him down, and&#xD;
have hinm ready for me in two hours, precisely."&#xD;
Time hostler seized the braille, and the obse-&#xD;
quious landlord reached out his hands for the&#xD;
portmnanteau and holsters ; but the soldier said,&#xD;
ml his rough tone :&#xD;

"I reckon I can take care of my own.things."&#xD;
" What's the newsfroii the army, colonel?"&#xD;
said the e eer-lpresent Blossoii.&#xD;

a look of contempt, as lie turned away Ioma the&#xD;
loafer.&#xD;
"Major; then-do tell us the news !" cried&#xD;
the unaiashed loafer.&#xD;
"" Nor I ain't a major, you mean skunk ! i&#xD;
know yon. Your nue is Blossom ; aii you&#xD;
was afeard to go to the wars with the rest of us,&#xD;
along with Colonel Arnold-who is going' to be&#xD;

Bless moy soul alive ! 'tis Eiunthan Cool-&#xD;

drink."&#xD;
"I ain't no captain ; nor I ain't trot so bad&#xD;
as ti tech sperruts vet !"said Eluathan---for it&#xD;
was himself, indeed.&#xD;
"Well. you'll smoke a friendly pipe, ani tell&#xD;
us how the colonel is," said the latidlori, anx-&#xD;
ions to detain and lilease one who tvould ie&#xD;
sure ti bring in plenty of custom as soon as it&#xD;
was known that he was there.&#xD;
"I don't use tolaecynrno sicl iuniy etnff;&#xD;

CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
ARNOLD AS A SEAMAN--BATTLE ON TUE LAKE.&#xD;
Over all of our beloved laud the gloom-cloud&#xD;
hung dark and thick, when the campaign open-&#xD;
ed in the spring of 1776. Forced from post to&#xD;
post, poor, sick, and worn out, our forces had&#xD;
been driven from Canada. General Schuyler&#xD;
-than whom a braver man, noble patriot, or&#xD;
generous foeman never existed - had been&#xD;
superseded by General Gates, who had centred&#xD;
his forces at Ticonderoga, with the intention of&#xD;
there resisting the approach of the British&#xD;
under General Carleton, who now threatenedi to&#xD;
invade our soil. The command of the lake&#xD;
was very necessary to resist this invasion, but&#xD;
our naval resources were few, and their in-&#xD;
crease almost impossible.&#xD;
Again, at thisjuncture, Arnold displayed his&#xD;
ambition and his energy. Receiving permis-&#xD;
sion from Gates, he fitted out a squadron, con-&#xD;
sisting of one sloop, three schooners, and five&#xD;
gondolas -- altogether mounting about. fifty&#xD;
guns--and with these he prepared, in the&#xD;
vicinity of Crown Point, to meet a naval force&#xD;
of the British of more than treble his weight&#xD;
and force. But the preparations of both par-&#xD;
ties delayed them until the summer was over,&#xD;
and again had the leafy trees begun to wear-&#xD;
their hues of red ani gold before our hero had&#xD;
another chance to distinguish himself. But it&#xD;
came at last.&#xD;
lIe had mcreased his fleet to two sloops,&#xD;
three schooners, three galleys, eight gondolas,&#xD;
and twenty-one gun-boats. Yet the enemy's&#xD;
force outnunbered his, and seven hundred&#xD;
chosen seamen under Commodore Pringle, and&#xD;
Edward P elew, afterwards Admiral Viscount&#xD;
Exmouth, one of England's greatest naval lead-&#xD;
ers, were opposed to his heterogeneous forces.&#xD;
Arnold fell thaek from his first position to a&#xD;
better one, between Isle La Mott and the main&#xD;
land, and there awaited the approach of the&#xD;
enemy. Few naval commanders could have&#xD;
chosen their position better, or maintained it&#xD;
with more skill anti spirit. The fire commenced&#xD;
at an early hour, and was continued'steadily all&#xD;
the day. One of the American vessels was&#xD;
soon in flames and destroyed, but the crew es-&#xD;
caped. The British landed a large body of'&#xD;
their Indian allies on the island, and the Ameri-&#xD;
cans were-expose I to their fire also. The ves-&#xD;
sels on both sides suffered very severely. N- arly&#xD;
one-fifth of Arniil's men were killed or wound -&#xD;
ed; but urged on by him, wio. pointed nearly&#xD;
every gun from iis own vessel, they fought&#xD;
all tne nore desperately for their loss. Nor had&#xD;
the enemy anvthig to brag over in regard to&#xD;
loss. With vessels hulled, shattered, and dis-&#xD;
malted, tiny anchored when darkness came on,&#xD;
within a few hitind ed yards of each other,&#xD;
forced by the nightto rest from earnare.&#xD;
But Arnold's eye sought not for sleep. He&#xD;
knew that the English had the advanL'ag  in&#xD;
force, weight of seital, and men, and that to&#xD;
renew the fight where he then was, would in-&#xD;
&#xD;
sure his defeat in the morning. Taking ad-&#xD;
vantage of a cloudy, gusty night, he slipped his&#xD;
cables quietly, and ran through the enemy's&#xD;
lines to the southward, and sought a-harbor or&#xD;
cove some ten miles southward, near Schuyler's&#xD;
Island, where all hands were put to work to&#xD;
repair damages, and prepare for another en-&#xD;
counter.&#xD;
Not once during the dark and stormy night&#xD;
did the American leader leave his deck, but he&#xD;
paced to and fro, issuing his orders, and ever&#xD;
and anon looking up through the driving clouds&#xD;
to gaze at that star which Luona had pointed&#xD;
out to him as his star of destiny, an which&#xD;
seemed to pierce the gloom with cheering ray,&#xD;
and to look out upon him.&#xD;
At last, morning came, and the British were&#xD;
astonished to find that the Americans, whom&#xD;
they supposed to be hemmed in and crippled&#xD;
beyond the power of escape, were not, in sight.&#xD;
But judging from the direction of the wind&#xD;
wheretthey hadgone, they soon made all sail in&#xD;
pursuit. The breeze was light, and it was&#xD;
nearly noon before they came in sight of Ar-&#xD;
nold, who, with his vessels repaired as much as&#xD;
possible, stood down the lake, determined, byr&#xD;
the chances of a running fight, to weaken and&#xD;
separate the enemy as much as possible, and&#xD;
then use every exertion to retrieve the for-&#xD;
tunes of the contest.&#xD;
But the British, whose numerous vessels&#xD;
were splendidly handled by the veteran seamen&#xD;
on board, gradually closed with him, and finally&#xD;
brought him to close action, with greater odds&#xD;
against him than ever.&#xD;
The "Washington" sloop was attacked so&#xD;
heavily that she was obliged to strike her col-&#xD;
ors ; and several gondolas, and Arnold's own&#xD;
galley-the-" Congress"-were the only vessels&#xD;
left to struggle for a victory hopelessly impos-&#xD;
sible. For four hours Arnold kept up the ter-&#xD;
rible contest, and only when his vessel, literally&#xD;
riddled, was sinking under him, did te run her&#xD;
ashore and set her and the gondolas on fire,&#xD;
each with her flag tattered and torn still flying&#xD;
to the breeze. Nor did he let the enemy board&#xD;
them to lower those proud ensigns, but kept up&#xD;
such a fire from the shore that the vessels were&#xD;
all destroyed, and the enemy obliged to haul off.&#xD;
Then, with those who were left of his noble hand,&#xD;
he retreated through the woods to Crown Point,&#xD;
and from thence to Ticonderoga, after display-&#xD;
ing as much skill in retreat as he did gallantry&#xD;
in action.&#xD;
And now, when this news spread, his name&#xD;
rung throughout the land, coupled with praises.&#xD;
No man in the army was more popular, when&#xD;
his age and rank were considered; for, young&#xD;
as he was, his commission as Brigadier-General&#xD;
had been made out. But we will hurry on with&#xD;
our tale, instead of pausing to relate matters&#xD;
with which every historical student should be&#xD;
acquainted.&#xD;

LUONA PRESCOTT ; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
ONCE MORE AT HOME-NEW LONDON AWAKE, AND&#xD;
OUR HEROINE IN SIGIIT.&#xD;
"THe is coming home! Coming home, cov-&#xD;
ered with honors, doubtless elated with pride&#xD;
and exultant from his rapid promotion! how&#xD;
shall I treat him? how shall I bind lim to&#xD;
me--without actually compromising myself-&#xD;
so as to fully control his future career, ana fulfill&#xD;
my mother's dying wish? lie will rise yet&#xD;
higher; he must reach the topmost round of&#xD;
the ladder of fame, else his fall will not forever&#xD;
crush him. It is only those who stand very&#xD;
higlh whose fall will be fatal!"&#xD;
Thus soliloquized Luona Prescott a few weeks&#xD;
after the occurrence noted in the prec ding&#xD;
chapter. She hell a letter in her hand which&#xD;
she had just received from Arnold, informing&#xD;
her of his intended return to rest for a short&#xD;
time prior to preparations soon to be made for&#xD;
the stormy and eventful campaign of 1777.&#xD;
And while she spoke, she gazed upon the leaf-&#xD;
less trees in her garden, upon the snowy sheet&#xD;
which overspread the ground, and all as cold&#xD;
did she seem as she planned her campaign in&#xD;
regard to him.&#xD;
Ier soliloquy was interrupted by the en-&#xD;
trance of Barbara.&#xD;
I've got a letter from  Elnathan, Miss&#xD;
Lona !" said the old woman.&#xD;
" Aht' he is well, I suppO ?"&#xD;
" lor the life of' me I can't make out but&#xD;
what he's crazy, every word is so full of sojer!&#xD;
I do wish this war was over, for I'm afeard he'll&#xD;
ie so epiled when it is, that he'll never be no&#xD;
good at anything else. Why, he wouldn't split&#xD;
kinllinig-wood for oe when he was here last-&#xD;
sail it wasn't dignity to do it. But what I&#xD;
come to tell you was, that he was a Commn'&#xD;
home right away. They are a goin' to rest off&#xD;
awhile from tightin', while the weather is cold.&#xD;
I should think they'd have to, for it must be&#xD;
awful hard work a sleepin' in the field, and a&#xD;
haudlin' of cold iron:'&#xD;
unI wish tou would put on your hood and&#xD;
mantle,b irhara, and go over to Mrs. Arnold's,&#xD;
to siy that I have a letter from her son, who is&#xD;
coming home soon ; perhaps she has not heard&#xD;
from hin!&#xD;
"I gue's sic has," sail the old housekeeper.&#xD;
" Laeta is, I see the postman a stoppin' at her&#xD;
house wlin I itent out to the store to get some&#xD;
sugar, a leetle while ago."&#xD;
' It wil it hurt you to go over and deliver&#xD;
my message," sail the young lady.&#xD;
" Not nm'uh, nly is hard travelin' for old&#xD;
legs," rephed the pl~ain-spoken old creature,&#xD;
n mor 'slpecialv in cold weather, and so slip-&#xD;
per, to. Eliathan's father can only jest git&#xD;
round with lis rhesiuatiz and all-liut look,&#xD;
Miss Louna, sakes alive, look ! There's two of-&#xD;
tieers getti' off their horses at the gate. Law&#xD;
me, if they should ie Britishers, what could we&#xD;
poor women do ! Memev me-if they should ."&#xD;
And the old woman trembled with terror.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Can you not see that it is General Arnold&#xD;
and Elnathan ?" said Luona, with a smile.&#xD;
I a sakes-no! Is it, though? You see I&#xD;
hadn't my specks on-and Benedict Arnold is&#xD;
a real gin'ral now. I shan't hardly dare to&#xD;
look atlhim. I s'pose Elnathan '1l feel too big&#xD;
to speak to me now, too."&#xD;
"You had better go and let them in," said&#xD;
Luona.&#xD;
"You'll want to dress up afore you see him&#xD;
now? Jest think, he's a gin'ral,' said Bar-&#xD;
bara.&#xD;
"And yet nothing more than a man-admit&#xD;
him at once to this room-I shall dress no&#xD;
more."&#xD;
"It won't take but jest a minute for me to&#xD;
make up a fire in the best company-room,"&#xD;
said the old servant.&#xD;
"You will do as I bid you-nothing more,"&#xD;
said Miss Prescott, sternly.&#xD;
The old servant hurried away, muttering&#xD;
something about a gin'ral being better treated ;&#xD;
but Luona arose and glanced at the mirror,&#xD;
then, throwing a light shawl over her shoul-&#xD;
ders, she reseated herself in a graceful position&#xD;
-for she, like most ladies, wished undoubtedly&#xD;
to look well before him-not that she loved him&#xD;
in the least, but that no fault of hers should&#xD;
lessen the impression she wished to make upon&#xD;
his nature.&#xD;
A moment only elapsed before his footsteps&#xD;
fell upon her ear, and he entered hastily, his&#xD;
face flushed with pleasure and pride, and hurry-&#xD;
ing up to take her extended hand, pressed it&#xD;
warmly but respectfully to his lips.&#xD;
"I am very, very happy to see you well, Miss&#xD;
Preseott," lie cried.&#xD;
" And I, that General Arnold has escaped so&#xD;
many perils, and returned in safety to visit his&#xD;
gio and anxius mother," said the lady, calmly,&#xD;
but kindly.&#xD;
" Ah, fair lady, it may be unfilial in me to&#xD;
say so, but if I had thought tlhat only my&#xD;
miothiur would feel rejoiced at my return, it is&#xD;
doubtful whether I should have revisited New&#xD;
London while the war lasted."&#xD;
"You surely have called upon her," said the&#xD;
lady, earnestly.&#xD;
"I have not; in feelings which absence have&#xD;
only strengthened, I caine first here to offer myi&#xD;
respee'ful duty."&#xD;
" l)uty, sir, should have been rendered first&#xD;
to the shrine of her who surely must feel most&#xD;
anxious for her only son. A mother's heart,&#xD;
tender in all its yearnings, so unselfish in its&#xD;
love, should not be wounded by the one who&#xD;
should be most earnest to cherish it," said&#xD;
Luota. "Excuse isle, General, if I speak re-&#xD;
provingly, but I had a mother once, and were&#xD;
I, even now that she is gone, to forget her, I&#xD;
should deem myself most ungrateful."&#xD;
"Lady, forgive me; I have erred, and will&#xD;
hasten to refrain my error. That duty done,&#xD;
may I hope again to be permitted to ask your&#xD;
forgiveness ?"&#xD;

THE CURSE FULFILLED.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I shall never refuse to see General Arnold&#xD;
at proper hours, while he remembers his duty&#xD;
to nis ,motherand his country," said Luona, ad&#xD;
she extended her hand to him, which he again&#xD;
pressed to his lips. Then he hastened away.&#xD;
"There is a lesson forihim which will please&#xD;
his mother, and make her a thousand times&#xD;
warmer in my favor, while it will add to his&#xD;
respect for me, for no man will love a woman&#xD;
whom lie is not made to respect," she said,&#xD;
when she was alone again. "He is proud, they&#xD;
say, inmperious to others, but I can control him.&#xD;
It is well for me that my heart is steeled to hate&#xD;
instead of love, and that I can remember my&#xD;
mother's wrongs, else would it, perchance, be&#xD;
hard to keep my oath."&#xD;
Arnold did not seem very well satisfied at&#xD;
being hurried away from her presence, and told&#xD;
to do what his sense, rather than his heirt's&#xD;
impulses, should have dictated to him at first.&#xD;
"She is a strange compound," ie said.&#xD;
"She has written to inc the kindest letters, fur-&#xD;
nished me money without a request, knowing&#xD;
the almost impossibility of our getting pay&#xD;
from the cramped government ; given me every&#xD;
proof of attachment and interest in that way--&#xD;
yet now she is cold, haughty as a queen, and&#xD;
reproves ue its if I were a school-boy! But&#xD;
she was right. I should have called upon my&#xD;
mother first. Yet most women would have&#xD;
been flattered by the haste which carried me&#xD;
first into their presence.  She is a strange&#xD;
woman, but I love her all the more for that. I&#xD;
would iot have one who is like the common&#xD;
class--sentiniental, nervous, full of terrors and&#xD;
palpitations, and whimsies. There is but one&#xD;
Luona in all the world, and she must be mine !"&#xD;
ieL reutnonted his horse and rode away, fol-&#xD;
lowed by Elnatlhan, who appeared to have been&#xD;
in Barbara's kitchen, for ie cane out of the&#xD;
house with a large chunk of gingerbread in his&#xD;
hand.  llow could a Yankee live without gin-&#xD;
gerbread?  Better deprive a Spaniard of tis&#xD;
garlic, an Italiitn of his maccaroni, a French-&#xD;
man of his frogs, or a German of his sourkrout,&#xD;
than to stint a Yankee in his gingerbread.&#xD;
CIIAPTZ R XVII.&#xD;
BLOSSoM OuT-BLoSsoMED-ELNATIAN GIVES THEM&#xD;
TIE NEWS.&#xD;
Not having stable accommodations at his&#xD;
mother's house, Arnold ordered Elinathan to&#xD;
take the horses to the tavern, while he hurried&#xD;
in to ernibrace her who had brought hin into&#xD;
the world.&#xD;
And deeply affecting was the meeting of mo-&#xD;
ther and son. Tears of joy rolled down her pale&#xD;
cheeks, hilessings were sobbed from her quiver-&#xD;
iag lips, mingled with thanks to that Deity&#xD;
which haid preserved him-her heart's prile and&#xD;
idol-froms the battle's carnage, from the perils&#xD;
of the terrible winter, front the mountain march,&#xD;
from the cataract's boiling yeast of dearth. Nor&#xD;
was ie emotionless. His heaving breast, his.&#xD;
flushed cheek, his low, husky tone, as he tried to&#xD;
&#xD;
choke back excitement-as he strained her to&#xD;
his manly bosom--all of this showed that nei-&#xD;
ther the stern trials of war, nor absence, nor&#xD;
power, nor gratified ambition, had lessened the&#xD;
son's feelings for his mother. But such scenes&#xD;
are sacred, and though it is a pleasure for us to&#xD;
dwell upon them, we must rush on with the&#xD;
tide, or our story and its events will never be&#xD;
told.&#xD;
*      *      **      *      *'     *&#xD;
"There comes that crabbed old stick, Elna-&#xD;
thani Goodrich, again !" said Blossom to the&#xD;
landlord of th6 tavern, as he saw the old man&#xD;
riding up.&#xD;
"Yes, and with two horses 1" said the other.&#xD;
"General Arnold must have conic. If I could&#xD;
only get the geiral to come here to stop, I'd&#xD;
give something nice ! Re'd draw a heap of&#xD;
custom I"&#xD;
"If you'll stand treat, I'll put an idea in your&#xD;
head that'll draw a heap if lie loni't coimie, and&#xD;
please him besides !" said Blossom, whose main&#xD;
study in life was how to get "a treat."&#xD;
" Done !"said the landlord. " What is it ?"&#xD;
"I'll tell you after the old crab is gone, for I&#xD;
don't want him to hear it !" said Blossom. "But&#xD;
you can set out the liquor now !"&#xD;
"I reckon I'll wait till I hear your plan !"&#xD;
said the landlord, who was used to tinny a case&#xD;
of "false pretence" on hBlossom's part, and&#xD;
meant to have "a show" for his liquor this time,&#xD;
at any rate.&#xD;
"An how d'ye do, Cap'n Goodrich ?" said&#xD;
lie, as Einatlan rode up and dismounted.&#xD;
"If you'd been with the army stead of selling&#xD;
p'ison rum, you'd know a cap'n when you see&#xD;
him, and not make a fool of yourself!" said El-&#xD;
nathan, with a tone of dry contempt.&#xD;
 Oh, I meant no offence !" replied Boniface.&#xD;
But yo m'll give us the news, won't you ?"&#xD;
"The latest-yes, let's have it, Mister Good-&#xD;
rich !" added Blossom.&#xD;
"The very latest 'I1 suit you, won't it ?" asked&#xD;
Elnathan, quietly.&#xD;
" Yes, yes, the very latest, in course I" said&#xD;
the landlord, as several mote of the denizens of&#xD;
the village crowded up to hear it. "But hadn't&#xD;
you better come in by the fire, out o' the cold,&#xD;
and tell it!"&#xD;
" No ; I reckon it won't take so long as you&#xD;
think !" said Elnathan, who felt ill of a vet-&#xD;
eran's contempt for the non-combatant topers&#xD;
around him. " The very latest news is-"&#xD;
Here he paused, while every mouth, ear, and&#xD;
eye of his auditors opened wider and wider.&#xD;
What?   Is Gin'ral Washin'ton dead, or&#xD;
Bosting taken, or-or what ?" asked Blossom,&#xD;
eagerly.&#xD;
"Yes, tell us quickly, if you can't conic in to&#xD;
do it, for it's awful cold out here !" said the land-&#xD;
lord.&#xD;
"Awful cold? You talk of cold, with woolen&#xD;

'te invitation was not to be declined with&#xD;
that crowd-they didn't know how.&#xD;
When Elnathan returned to the cheerful&#xD;
kitchen where Barbara, his half-sister, had al-&#xD;
ready prepared a warm and most luxurious&#xD;
meal for one so long used to the hardships of a&#xD;
camp, she at once noticed the sour look on his&#xD;
face, and said:&#xD;
"aYou look as if you were mad, Elnathan."&#xD;
"Jest so," said he, as he sat down before the&#xD;
fire.&#xD;
"Then do take off your sword, you might do&#xD;
somethin' dreadful with it," said sie.&#xD;
"No fear o' me when I'i amongst wit-&#xD;
men," he replied, but he got up and took his&#xD;
sword, and hung it up carefully on a hook in&#xD;
a corner.&#xD;
"What made you mad?     But I reckon you'll&#xD;
better eat supper first. That'll put you in&#xD;
better hupor."&#xD;
"Jest so,' replied Elnathan, "eatin' always&#xD;
does. You cook awful nice, Barbara, I've often&#xD;
wished you were 'long with us, we've hard&#xD;
eatin', sometimne,1"&#xD;
" dare say," said Barbara, as she poured&#xD;
out a cup of tea for Elintlatn-for she had tea,&#xD;
scare and high as it was ; ihe could no more&#xD;
do without tiat, than Blossom could without&#xD;
grog.&#xD;
gDogs, horse-meat, any sil like,- some.&#xD;

of pork front aid its surroundings of baked&#xD;
getts.&#xD;
Sakes alive! and you eat it ?"&#xD;
"est so. Ihad to, or starve, when we was&#xD;
gouit' through the woods to Uanala."&#xD;
Mercy me. It was well yoi had no women&#xD;
alone."&#xD;
" But we did. There was Sergeant Grier's&#xD;
wife, Polly, kept as fat as butter, tnl she lived.&#xD;
jest its poorly as any of us. She was  more of a&#xD;
matt in her ways than a good rtany that wore&#xD;

"Dear me, she must have loved her man&#xD;

LUONA PRi&#xD;
&#xD;
"I wish, fair and most kind lady, that I had&#xD;
no such high-sounding title as general, whn a I&#xD;
am in your presence. It sounds so coldly from&#xD;
your lips. Could I address you as a queen, I&#xD;
would be glad then to be considered as your&#xD;
general-none more true or faithful should be&#xD;
found among your subjects !"&#xD;
"I fear that you would prefer to be my mon-&#xD;
arch; and possess rue for a subject !" sail the&#xD;
lady, with a sitile, now leading him toward the&#xD;
very track from which she had driven him so&#xD;
often&#xD;
"Ah, lady, if such happiness could be mine,&#xD;
I would change thrones with no monarch on&#xD;
earth !" said Arnold, in an impassioned tone.&#xD;
As it is, I aiii only too happy to kneel as a&#xD;
subject."&#xD;
And he bent one knee before her and grasped&#xD;
her lind. What next he would have said or&#xD;
done, we cannot t II, for a heavy rap at the&#xD;
door caused him to start to his feet and blush&#xD;
with c+infueiuun. In fact, he was so confused&#xD;
that he du nut note her calmness and perfect&#xD;
self-possession, nor the gleam of triumph in her&#xD;
eye-a luk so unlike the timid mreekness of&#xD;
tone that a riiere tyro in the "art divine" would&#xD;
have Cecii it, had lie been observant.&#xD;
The intruder was none other than Elnathan,&#xD;
who, with his grave and stolid face and upright&#xD;
form, now stood in the door-way with his hand&#xD;
raised to a riilitary s lute, not knowing wheth-&#xD;
er to lance or retreat, but waited orders.&#xD;
"Ikarbairn said that you wanted to see me&#xD;
after smug1r, Miss lona'!" said lie.&#xD;
"Yes," she replied, delighted at the in&#xD;
terruhptmwn, because it so annoyed Arnold&#xD;
-     "I wishd to hear your adventures in the&#xD;
war.&#xD;
Oh, I haven't had any, ma'am-the in'ra&#xD;
did all that, pnid he can tell you ! lie know&#xD;
how to talk to ladies-h don't !" replied Elina&#xD;
than, who, seeing that Arnold was displeased&#xD;
wanted to hack out now.&#xD;
"'erlaps hte has hind more experience o&#xD;
late," s ut l.uona, amni hug.&#xD;
" Jeet so," replied Eluathian, not knowin1&#xD;
what he sai, so flurried was he.&#xD;
You imiipudent rascal !-you never saw m&#xD;
speak to a wuvomuan while we have been absent!I&#xD;
cried Arnold, in a rage.'&#xD;
"tWho sail I did, gin'ral !" said Elnathan&#xD;
in a reproachful tone. " And what's mor&#xD;
I never heard you call me an impudent ra&#xD;
cal, either-neither afore folks nor no othe&#xD;
time&#xD;
"1W  l, well, I was angry at your expre&#xD;
sion, nthieh night have led this young lady&#xD;
believe that I had thought of other matters tha&#xD;
those pertaiiiing to my duty as a soldier whi&#xD;
away."&#xD;
"I'll take my Bihle oath you ain't, ginral-&#xD;
I was up early and late with you, drilling th&#xD;
men and tigitin' the enemy every chance-&#xD;
don't believe you ever thought of a woman-&#xD;
'sept Miss Lona and your mother-while&#xD;
&#xD;
1I&#xD;
&#xD;
ESCOTT ; OR,&#xD;
were gone ; leastwise you never spoke of any&#xD;
other."&#xD;
It was Luona's turn to feel a little confused&#xD;
now, and the old mantprobably thinking that&#xD;
he had said enough, took theback track, and&#xD;
closed the door as he made his exit.&#xD;
"lie spoke the truth, lady !" said Arnold,&#xD;
without taking his former position at her feet,&#xD;
however. " No thought of mine, apart from&#xD;
duty, has been wasted upon another-the senti-&#xD;
mernts which I expressed before I went away&#xD;
have grown only stronger as time advanced.'&#xD;
"General, let us speak of something nobler&#xD;
than my poor, perishable self. Until this war&#xD;
is over, no true soldier should think of love&#xD;
"Ah, lady, if I could but hope that, when it&#xD;
was over, that dear hand might be the reward&#xD;
for every peril and hardship Ihad endured,&#xD;
that hope would seal my lips while it fortified&#xD;
my heart !"&#xD;
"You may hate me by that time .        ,&#xD;
"hate you ?-oh, never, never can such love'&#xD;
as mine be changed to hate!'&#xD;
"There is no hate so fierce as that born of&#xD;
love, disappointed or unrequited-or, at least,&#xD;
so I have heard."&#xD;
"Lady, at least tell me that you do not love&#xD;
another ?"&#xD;
" Yes-dearly, very dearly !" replied Luona,&#xD;
warmly.&#xD;
"Then I must bid you farewell forever! My&#xD;
only hope is for a noble death, even as for your&#xD;
sake I have sought to live a noble life ."~;&#xD;
And lie rose to go.&#xD;
- "Stay !" said she, earnestly. "You have&#xD;
not asked me to whom my present affections&#xD;
e are engaged."&#xD;
"Surely, I do not seek to know. If I di,&#xD;
l my passion might prompt an act which would&#xD;
e make you unhappy! I do not seek to know his&#xD;
- name."&#xD;
, "His name? who spoke of a him'?" she cried,&#xD;
laughing. "I can appeal toBarbara and prove&#xD;
f by her, as you did by Elnathan, that I have&#xD;
lived like a very hermit ever since my poor&#xD;
g  mother's death.  I have only visited  our&#xD;
mother; and my only male visitors have been&#xD;
e the village parson and the doctor--one of whom&#xD;
wants me to pave my road to Heaven by build-&#xD;
ing him a new church, and the other desires me&#xD;
, to immortalize myself by erecting a hos-&#xD;
e, pital. Not knowing but I might need the serv-&#xD;
e- ices of one to kill me, secundum artem, and of&#xD;
r the other to preach my funeral-sermon, accord-&#xD;
ing to orthodox custom, I thought it not beat&#xD;
a- to shut my doors against them I"&#xD;
o    "But, lady, you jest strangely.  You said&#xD;
n you loved some one very, very dearly. Oh may&#xD;
le I hope that it is-"&#xD;
"My own very, very dear self!" she cried,&#xD;
-   with a merrier laugh than ever he had heard&#xD;
ie from her lips. "Why, 1 spend almost an hour&#xD;
I a day at my mirror admiring myself."&#xD;
-- "  ah ad, you trifle with me while you ci.'&#xD;
ye jest I"&#xD;
&#xD;
81&#xD;
&#xD;
" But I do not jest-I speak the truth.  If,&#xD;
after the war is over, by any possibility I should&#xD;
love you better than myself, you shall not be&#xD;
left ignorant of the fact."&#xD;
"Then, dear lady, I will wait for that hour,&#xD;
and as little as possible intrude upon you my&#xD;
presence, or the feelings which I cannot all&#xD;
conceal."&#xD;
"Remember that I do not banish you from&#xD;
my preseece-your visits, like those of your&#xD;
mother, will ever be agreeable to me," she said,&#xD;
with a smile and a tone which set his impulsive&#xD;
heart on fire.&#xD;
"Angel!" he cried, and again he knelt and&#xD;
pressed her hand upon his lips.&#xD;
"Be you going' to have any tea, Miss Lena ?"&#xD;
cried Barbara, opening the door at that instant&#xD;
and discovering the position of Arnold.&#xD;
"Yes, I suppose even angels must eat. Tea&#xD;
in haste for two, Barbara, in the front room.&#xD;
You must excuse late suppers, general, for I am&#xD;
so unfashionable as to eat only when I am&#xD;
hungry."&#xD;
Arnold stammered out something, he was so&#xD;
confused he hardly knew what. It did look&#xD;
rather beneath the dignity of a Brigadier-Gen-&#xD;
eral in the American army to becaught by a&#xD;
servant in the act of kneeling at a lady's feet-.&#xD;
but I believe, even to this day, more generals&#xD;
and their subordinates, except colonels, will be&#xD;
found kneeling and offering prayers and vows&#xD;
there than any where else. Isn't it so,ladies?&#xD;
After taking one good long look'as if to sat-&#xD;
isfy herself that it was safe to believe her eyes,&#xD;
Barbara turned away to obey the directions&#xD;
which she had received. .&#xD;
"You are unfortunate, general, in being dis-&#xD;
covered when you forget your dignity. Let me&#xD;
advise you never to kneel to any but your&#xD;
God 1" said Luona, kindly. "I am the last one&#xD;
to be worshiped, I am sure; for it seems to me&#xD;
that the spirit of mischief is in me to-night.&#xD;
But if I have in any light word wounded your&#xD;
feelings to night, I aieerely regret it, and ask&#xD;
your forgiveness."&#xD;
" Ah,lady, you make me feel that I am but a&#xD;
poor soldiei- if I cannot bear a jest from your&#xD;
lips. But I believe I am too sincere in my own&#xD;
feelings toe eale to understand the jests of&#xD;
another. Yet one word of kindness from your&#xD;
lips, one look when your good and noble heart&#xD;
seems to speak through your eyes, heals every&#xD;
wound I"&#xD;
"Tea is ready-'twas all fixed, but steepin', r&#xD;
said Barbara, taking the precaution this time,.&#xD;
-by coughing, to announce her approach.&#xD;
How bread and butter sinks the starry light&#xD;
of romance down into the tallow-candle-ss of&#xD;
reality ! Talk of love and bohea-tea-cakes&#xD;
and affection-ginger-bread and matrimony!--&#xD;
It is not to be thought of ! Therefore, while&#xD;
our heroine and hero are over the table,&#xD;
we'll close the chapter and look elsewhere.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
THE PERPLEXITY OF THE INEXPERIENCED, AND&#xD;
THE EXPLANATION OF THE ARTFUL.&#xD;
"La, sakes ! what can it mean I" said Bar-&#xD;
bara. "What can Gin'ral Arnold have done&#xD;
to Miss Lona ? When I went into her sittin'-&#xD;
room, jest now, to ask her if she wanted tea, he&#xD;
was a kneelin' down afore her as if he'd been a&#xD;
doin' somethin' awful, and was beggin' her to&#xD;
forgive him !"&#xD;
"Did she look mad ?" asked Elnathan, glanc-&#xD;
ing at his father, who had got to sleep in his&#xD;
chair, in the chimney-corner.&#xD;
"No ; she was a-laughin' fit to burst the&#xD;
hooks and eyes off her dress !" replied Barbara.&#xD;
"I never knew the like before. What can it&#xD;
mean ?"&#xD;
"Wasn't he lookin' for something' on the floor&#xD;
that she'd dropped ?" asked Elnathan, thought-&#xD;
fully.&#xD;
" No ; for his eyes was lookin' up tow'rds&#xD;
hers, and he had hold of her hand."&#xD;
"If she was a laughing' he wasn't a prayin' ;&#xD;
and I never knew him to pray, though he swears&#xD;
awful when lie's a fighting . it's nip and tie with&#xD;
him and old Ethan Allen."&#xD;
"Do tell! I'm afeard you'll get to swearin'&#xD;
hearing' so much as you do !"&#xD;
"So be I,sometimes," said Elnathan, thought-&#xD;
fully. "There's one man in the army that&#xD;
never swears."&#xD;
"And that's-"&#xD;
" Gin'ral Washington! and they do say he&#xD;
prays, but lie don't do out afore folks like&#xD;
Pharisee, thoughli e has worship every Sunday&#xD;
when there isn't no marchin'."&#xD;
"He's a good man; but I'd like to know&#xD;
what the gm'ral--our gin'ral I mean-was a&#xD;
doin' on his knees afore Miss Lona !"&#xD;
"Maybe lie was making' love--for I know he&#xD;
loves her," said Einathan.&#xD;
"That wasn't the way folks made love When&#xD;
I was a gal !" said Barbara. "If a feller loved&#xD;
a gal then, as soon as the old folbs was out of&#xD;
the way, courtin' night, he slid right close up&#xD;
to his gal, and hugged and kissed lher; and if&#xD;
she liked him, she didn't stick to tell him of it,&#xD;
but kissed him, ever so many times !"&#xD;
"Yes, that was the way, I remember it," said&#xD;
Elnathan, with a sigh. ''Pumpkin-pies wasn't&#xD;
scarce, neither."&#xD;
"No, nor ginger-bread; and the fellers used&#xD;
to bring sugar-sticks and raisins in their pock-&#xD;
ets, just to let the gale pick 'em out 1"&#xD;
A ring from Luona's bell put an end to this&#xD;
sonfab, for Barbara had to- hasten to answer it;&#xD;
therefore undoubtedly some of the reminiscent&#xD;
secrets of ancient courtship were irrecoverably&#xD;
lost to our readers.&#xD;

The quiet village of New London had some-&#xD;
thing new again to talk of, within three or four&#xD;
days after Arnold's arrival at home. The" idea"&#xD;
of the immortal Blossom had been carried out&#xD;
bythe skillful hand of Tim Glazier, the painter,&#xD;

But, best of all, Gehn-ral Arnold had, before&#xD;
he left the army, ordered a recruiting sergeant&#xD;

that direction, and that very important mdi-&#xD;
vidual, at once the delight of the little bove, the&#xD;
grown-up girls, aiid the terror of old women&#xD;
and nervous imidividuals, hadl arrived, with a&#xD;
color-bearer, a fifer, and a druinnier, and what&#xD;
with his gaudy uniform aind music, created an&#xD;
immense furore at the tavern. Several of those&#xD;
whom nothing elSe could have affected enli-ted&#xD;
after they hadl become valorous over the rum&#xD;
of Mr. ioniface , and e',en Blossom went so&#xD;
far as to net as an aid, an advocate for the ser-&#xD;

le spring had come icagain-not the soft andI&#xD;
balyro  spring of the southern elime, but the&#xD;
cold an ln-kward season between snow and&#xD;
bh. esomin-, known as spring in New England.&#xD;
Althouhls April had nearly run its length, and&#xD;
May-day" was near, no flowers yet carpeted"&#xD;
the earth--the frozen-looking buds upon the&#xD;
trees yet shivered on their branches, and refused&#xD;
to cast their green banners to the cold north-&#xD;
tastein blasts.  Yet the campaign had already&#xD;
commenced, or was commencing, whenever the&#xD;
season would allow-though Burgoyne, stillim-&#xD;
peded by the ice and snow of Canada, had no'&#xD;
commenced the marches which ended in his&#xD;
capture, and the destruction of one of the best&#xD;
appointed armies which our patriot fathers had&#xD;
to meet in all the ilevolution. But of that,&#xD;
when the proper time and place artives.&#xD;
General Arnold had bidden adieu to those&#xD;
whom he loved at New London, and as usual,&#xD;
followed by Elnathan, had arrived at New Ha-&#xD;
yen to ma-e arrangements and wait orders for&#xD;
the active service so rapidly to ensue. With&#xD;
him was General Wooster and several other&#xD;
othicers. They were at dinner on the 26th of&#xD;
April, when a messenger arrived it full speed&#xD;
from  General Silliman, of the Connectient&#xD;
militia, who announced that a large British force&#xD;
had been landed under Governor Tryon, near&#xD;
Con"lo, whose destination was Danbury, and&#xD;
their object the capture or destruction of a&#xD;
large depot of military store's there.&#xD;
The meal was left untasted-th re was boot-&#xD;
ing and spurring in hot haste, and soon the&#xD;
brave officers were mounted and oil to meet th-&#xD;
invaders, spreading the news, and gathering&#xD;
the brave militia-men as they hurried on.&#xD;
But rapidly as they moved, and hastily as&#xD;
they gathered their men, they were too late to&#xD;
save the town of Danbury, or to preserve the&#xD;
stores. They reached a village called ltethel&#xD;
shortly before midnight, and at that very hour&#xD;
the dense gloom of a stormy night was ma'e&#xD;
lurid by the flames which roared andl whirledl&#xD;
above the burning houses of Danhury ; where&#xD;
death and mad havoc was already going on-&#xD;
where the British, maddened by rumn and di-&#xD;
rected by a second Nero, or a fiend Incarnate&#xD;
in the shape of Tryon, were eousnsitting the&#xD;
most horrible excesses.&#xD;
The British papers teemed but lately with&#xD;
accounts of atrocities consisttel by the h oor&#xD;
East Indians, whom they have robhed and in-&#xD;
slaved for years-deeds done, as thry say, by&#xD;
heathens nd by savages-hut let them look&#xD;
back to the darkened pages of their own histo-&#xD;
ry, and remember how the   and their hired!&#xD;
1lessians and Indians burned our towns and vil-&#xD;
lages, slew old men, women, and children, who&#xD;
were defenceless-how the wail of the violated,&#xD;
the shriek of the dying, rose all over our land,&#xD;

especially in the track of Tryon, Tarleton, and&#xD;
such ' gallant British leadera" and forever&#xD;
after hold their peace. Never was an unjust&#xD;
war more cruelly waged than that in which the&#xD;
Americans struggled for their freedom. Espe-&#xD;
cially in its earlier portion was every rule of&#xD;
civilized warfare violated by the English, and it&#xD;
was only when our prowess enabled us to make&#xD;
reprisals, that their barbarity was lessened.&#xD;
But this is not our sary, though the episode is&#xD;
very natural in one who cones from old Revo-&#xD;
lutionary stock.        -&#xD;
In the morning after his arrival at Danbury,&#xD;
altlhough it was the Sabbath, 'ryon burned all&#xD;
of the houses which had escaped the night be-&#xD;
fore, except a few belonging to Tory friends of"&#xD;
tne British cause ; and then, perceiving that&#xD;
the country was alarmed, began to retreat to-&#xD;
ward the shipping from which lie had landed.&#xD;
Meantime, the Americans forming in two di-&#xD;
visions, one to harass his rear, and the other to&#xD;
head him off, or in military parlance, to "in-&#xD;
tercept his retreat," pushed forward with the&#xD;
utmost speed.&#xD;
General Wooster, who proved his devotion&#xD;
with his best heart's blood, commanded the first&#xD;
named, consisting of only about two hundred&#xD;
raw and undisciplined militiamen, without ar-&#xD;
tillerv, and following them up by the smoke&#xD;
and tihe track of their accursed desolation, soon&#xD;
opened a deadly fire upon their rear-guard,&#xD;
which, tired from havoc and unrest, and weak&#xD;
from dissipation, at first fell into such disorder,&#xD;
that lie killed many, and took over forty pris-&#xD;
oners. So fiercely did lie attack the enemy,&#xD;
that their march was checked, and they were&#xD;
obliged to.turn upon him and bring their artil-&#xD;
lery into play. This enabled Arnold and Silli-&#xD;
man with the other division of four hundred&#xD;
men to gain a point in advance of the British,&#xD;
and to prepare to give them a serious check.&#xD;
But, ala-! for him and his country's cause, of&#xD;
which few more useful or brighter ornaments&#xD;
existed, lie fell while leading on his men, and&#xD;
Tryon again moved forward.&#xD;
But now Arnold was before him, and at Ridge-&#xD;
field village had formed a barricade across the&#xD;
main street, flanked by houses on one side,&#xD;
and a ledge of rocks on the other.  Here, with&#xD;
only two hundred men, he stood and faced over&#xD;
two thousand of the advancing enemy. For&#xD;
fifteen minutes, with terrific effect, a Are was&#xD;
kept up by the gallant Americans, but sudden-&#xD;
ly they found that they were -flanked both on&#xD;
the right and left.&#xD;
Arnold-who sat upon his horse encouraging&#xD;
his men-was fired at by an entire British pla-&#xD;
toon from the crest of the rocks, at not thirty&#xD;
yards distance ; his horse shot dead ; so that his&#xD;
feet were entangled beneath the dead animal;&#xD;
yet not a bullet touched him. But the Ameri-&#xD;
cans began to fly, for they supposed him to he&#xD;
killed.  Never was he in greater peril of death&#xD;
or capture.&#xD;
"Darn you, don't run off and leave the&#xD;

I t&#xD;
$1&#xD;
Ii9&#xD;
tIj&#xD;
a&#xD;
&#xD;
gin'ral here to be stuck like a fall pig !" shout.&#xD;
ed. Elnathan, to the flying Americans, while ,&#xD;
threw down the long musket which he had been&#xD;
using with great effect, and drew him out from&#xD;
beneath the horse,&#xD;
A dozen of the enemy sprang ever the now&#xD;
deserted barricade, but Elnathan seized his long&#xD;
gun, and swinging it around his head with fear.&#xD;
ful force, kept back, for a moment, all who did&#xD;
not fall before his terrible blows,&#xD;
"Run, gin'ral-my horse is tied to a post out&#xD;
there a leetle ways-runnin' ain't no disgrace&#xD;
when there's only us agin' a multitude !' he&#xD;
shouted, slowly retreating, but striking right&#xD;
and left all the time.&#xD;
Arnold reached the horse, and mounting,&#xD;
rode off to endeavor to rally his flying men for&#xD;
another stand;1t Elinathan was not quite so&#xD;
lucky-; he tripped over t he corpse of a man&#xD;
behind him, and fell; and in another instant&#xD;
was pinned to the earth, with one bayonet&#xD;
through his shoulder, and another through the&#xD;
fleshy part of his thigh.&#xD;
"You're a dead Yankee !" shouted a burly&#xD;
ruffian, as lie raised his sword to crush the ex-&#xD;
istence out of him.&#xD;
"Jest so !" said Elnathan, "do it quickand&#xD;
don't hurt no more'n possible l"&#xD;
But Elnathan's time had not come. A Bri-&#xD;
tish officer, who had noticed his bravery and&#xD;
his devotion to his master, interfered, and he&#xD;
was kindly carried to one side, and there left to&#xD;
bleed to death ; for the British could not take&#xD;
care of their own wounded now--the enraged&#xD;
Americans gathering from every quarter were&#xD;
so pressing them, that a hasty retreat to their&#xD;
ships alone could save them from titter de-&#xD;
struction. But this was not to be effected so&#xD;
easily. The Americans increased every hour ;&#xD;
the men became tired and disheartened ; and&#xD;
when night came on, they were obliged to en-&#xD;
camp in a strong position and rest.&#xD;
Meantime the Americans still gathered, and&#xD;
when the British moved on at daylight, Arnold&#xD;
was again upon them, aided by other brave offi-&#xD;
cers. At last, assisted by the marines from the&#xD;
ships, the British re-embarked, with the loss of&#xD;
over three hundred men, and Tryon himself&#xD;
was wounded. But for a hesitation on the part&#xD;
of the Connecticut militia-who fell back when&#xD;
Arnold had a second horse shot under him, all&#xD;
of the marauders would have been captured.&#xD;
Never before had Arnold acted more brit-&#xD;
liantly titan here. Leading on raw men, liter.&#xD;
ally forcing them to fight, lie exposed himself&#xD;
with more than his usual temerity. Congress&#xD;
passed a resolution of praise upon hearing of&#xD;
his conduct, and directed the quartermaster-&#xD;
general to purchase a horse, and present the&#xD;
same to him as a token of approval.&#xD;
After the British were gone, his first thought&#xD;
was to find if Elnathan was yet alive, for the&#xD;
British had carried off no prisoners. Upon in-&#xD;
quiring at Ridgefield, he at last foundwhere a&#xD;
man lay at a farm-house answering his de.&#xD;

&#xD;
Then, raising his voice, he added: "What do&#xD;
you think you could do, my young friend ?"&#xD;
"My cousin has told me what to do, sir?'&#xD;
said the youth, returning Arnold's look steadi-&#xD;
ly, as if he felt deeply interested in gazing upon&#xD;
so great a man.&#xD;
"If not a secret, what were her directions ?"&#xD;
"To fight like a man by your side, sir, and&#xD;
die there, to aid you, if necessary !" replied&#xD;
the youth, placing his hand upon a fine French&#xD;
rapier by his side, and then touching the hilts&#xD;
of two gold-mounted pistols in his holsters.&#xD;
Arnold smiled-but gratified pride was in&#xD;
his look also, that sie should think so much of&#xD;
him as to give such directions to her cousin.&#xD;
It is well-I will make you my aid, Mr.&#xD;
Prescott, and as soon as possible will see about&#xD;
getting a commission for you!"&#xD;
" I wish no commission, sir-will accept&#xD;
none. M y only desire is accomplished in the&#xD;
positi'tn you give milel'&#xD;
"Well-wie will see ! But I expect every mo-&#xD;
ment to hi' called into action, and you are too&#xD;
tired to participate iii it.  You had better re-&#xD;
tire into my eluarters and rest&#xD;
"No, sir; please excuse iie in that, and give&#xD;
me a fresh horse. Mine is timed, but I am&#xD;
not -"&#xD;
Arnold smiled, and ordered one of his own&#xD;
horses to be brought out, and to have young&#xD;
Prescott's saddle and mountimgs changed to&#xD;
that--at the same time observing, th it a few&#xD;
months of hard service would cool down that&#xD;
fiery enthusiasm.&#xD;
"It don't seem to have altered you much,&#xD;
sir! or else you mrust have been very enthu-&#xD;
siastic at first !" said the young man, as he&#xD;
noticed how , restlessly Arnold watched for&#xD;
the first sound of movement from the enemy's&#xD;
camn).&#xD;
Agaim Arnold smiled, for he was pleased with&#xD;
the easy honesty apparent in the youth's comn-&#xD;
pliments, and the absence of that fear and stiff-&#xD;
ness which pervaded those around him, who ad-&#xD;
dressed him not as Sir, but as General.&#xD;
"You at uiast will take refreshments before&#xD;
we mount!" said lie.&#xD;
Not without you order it, sir, for I break-&#xD;
fasted with some jolly good fellows about five&#xD;
miles from  here, where they were on guard !&#xD;
They belonged to Morgan's rifles, and wanted&#xD;
me to enlist, iut I told them I was engaged ! One&#xD;
of them said it was to a pretty girl, but to that&#xD;
I answered nay ! IIallo-what's that ?"&#xD;
It was the heavy boom of an advanced bat-&#xD;
tery of light artillery in the direction of the&#xD;
enemy's camp.&#xD;
"The play has begun !" eriel Arnold, as he&#xD;
mounted, to place himself at the head of his&#xD;
division.&#xD;
"But not ended'!" said young Prescott, as he&#xD;
sprung imto his saddle-&#xD;
"Keep close by me, and do not expose your-&#xD;
self unnecessarily !" cried Arnold, to the for-&#xD;
mer, as he drove his spurs into his horse and gal-&#xD;
&#xD;
85&#xD;
&#xD;
loped off, followed by his young aid, orderly,&#xD;
and several subordinates.&#xD;
It was a grand sight-that of those two ar-&#xD;
mies extended over the plains and rolling hills&#xD;
of the beautiful Hudson-their pennons wav-&#xD;
ing, their arms glittering like silver and gold,&#xD;
their plumes fluttering in the air. A grand&#xD;
sight, as they moved into position, and paused&#xD;
to breathe before they rushed together-&#xD;
paused to tighten girths and reins, to firmer&#xD;
grasp their weapons ere they rushed forward&#xD;
into the strife from which so many never would&#xD;
retire.&#xD;
. When Arnold rode to the head of his divi-&#xD;
sion, consisting of Morgan's invincible rifle-&#xD;
men, and Dearborn's infantry, the deafening&#xD;
cheers which rose attested his popularity.&#xD;
Slowly the British advanced-so slowly, indeed,&#xD;
that Arnold repeatedly sent to General Gates&#xD;
for permission to commence the attack, by ad-&#xD;
vancing with his division. The permission was&#xD;
at last granted, and like a flight of arrows from&#xD;
pliant bows,-the light horse of Morgan flew for-&#xD;
ward, followed on the run by Dearborn's men.&#xD;
And in the very van, Arnold was seen on his&#xD;
favorite charger, a huge brown stallion, as fierce&#xD;
and fiery as his master.&#xD;
"Forward I" was the word, and nobly was it&#xD;
obeyed, and soon the crash of the battle of Still-&#xD;
water made the air resound with its awful noise.&#xD;
At first time British recoiled before the shock -&#xD;
but, rallied by the gallant Fraser, they in turn&#xD;
were forced forward, and the Americans checked,&#xD;
then driven back. And now back and forth,&#xD;
like strong men clenched, neither yielding, but&#xD;
alternately swaying to and fro, they struggled&#xD;
through all the long, long day.  Night alone&#xD;
brought a cessation to time conflict, and neither&#xD;
party were victors. Upon their arms many of&#xD;
term slept ; but, aimh! how many slept in death.&#xD;
Near one thousand gallant spirits went up that&#xD;
day to the King of kings, to appeal against that&#xD;
king who, with his vile ministers, had caused&#xD;
this bloodshed.&#xD;
Again Arnold, though he had been every-&#xD;
where in peril, retired to Isis quarters to rest,&#xD;
without hav.nig been touched.  With him was&#xD;
young Prescott, who had behaved as calmly&#xD;
during all that terrible conflict as if he hid been&#xD;
a veteran in service instead-of being engaged&#xD;
in his first battle.&#xD;
"This has been a hard day, James !" said Ar-&#xD;
nold, to his young aid, for the latter had been&#xD;
so near him ill day thatlie had become quite&#xD;
familiarized to him.&#xD;
"iRather a busy one, sir!  But you seemed&#xD;
to like it."&#xD;
No better than yourself. You take matters&#xD;
very coolly !"&#xD;
* Who could help it, sir, with such an exam-&#xD;
ple before him !"&#xD;
"Why, James, you are quite a woman in flat.&#xD;
tery !"&#xD;
." But a man in action, I hope, sirl" said the&#xD;
youth, hastily.&#xD;

" Yes, I will testify to that!  In that large&#xD;
on the Hessian dragoons I saw you un'iorsel&#xD;
one of their finest officers&#xD;
"lie was try ing to do me the same favor, sir,'&#xD;
but fortune was on my side !"&#xD;
"Not fort une, but skill, my brave boy. You&#xD;
hinlie a sword beautifully, and your horse as&#xD;
well!'&#xD;
"'I'me credit is due to my cousin, sir !" said&#xD;
the -outh. "She would not let me enter the&#xD;
field until 1 had taken lessons and prepared my.&#xD;
self with practice&#xD;
" Bltes your cousin, she is to me a guardian&#xD;
angel, ' sad Arnold, warmly; and ihe glanced&#xD;
up to tho starry sky to look upon the star of&#xD;
destiny again. "By-the way, I ought to write&#xD;
to her' but 1 am very tired! Can you not pen&#xD;
her a faN lili"s&#xD;
" Wlhat shall I say, sir?  That you love her&#xD;
very much&#xD;
Al , you young rogue, what makes you&#xD;
thinkso"&#xD;
causee your face flushed up, and your&#xD;
hand trembled, when you opened and read her&#xD;
letter&#xD;
"To are ob'ervant, Master James ! Do you&#xD;
think that she loves mc?"&#xD;
"Yea-at least I have an idea she does !"&#xD;
said the youth.&#xD;
"W h   '&#xD;
"Because I heard her say once that she hated&#xD;
you !"&#xD;
Arnold laughed.&#xD;
"h ow on earth, then, could you think she&#xD;
loved me ?" he asked.&#xD;
" Be-ause women always go by contraries !"&#xD;
repli-l ti he young 1l1u.&#xD;
" You seem to in lersaind women very well,&#xD;
for one so young?" said Arnold, looking him iiin&#xD;
the ee.c'p&#xD;
"'lst is easily accounted for," replied the&#xD;
aid, conifidently. ~1 have been much in their&#xD;
company ; anti being young, they dil not think&#xD;
it worth while to mask themselves from me, as&#xD;
they walh from older men!&#xD;
tool reasoning !" said Arnold.&#xD;
"Jest so !' replied James, so perfectly imi-&#xD;
tating Eluathan's voice, in his favorite expres-&#xD;
sion, that Arnold looked around, believing that&#xD;
his obl favorite was there.&#xD;
Was that you who spoke r he asked.&#xD;
" Yes, sir," replied the youth ; "at my cous-&#xD;
in's I met your old valet, who has almost re-&#xD;
covered from his wounds, and is on his way to&#xD;
join you; and I got into the habit of imitating&#xD;
him 'sometutii'."&#xD;
'Youi ire a ca ital mimic. I would have&#xD;
swri that it ias Eluathan himself!" said Ar-&#xD;
null.&#xD;
~"I am better than you think for-if you het&#xD;
the liue', I'll laigh y  out of them in a voice&#xD;
so litc+uin Lu's, that you'll swear i'm her&#xD;

go anl write that letter to her before I get too&#xD;
sleepy."&#xD;
&#xD;
"By Jove ! the likeness would be strong, if&#xD;
his skin was not so dark. Besides, he is not&#xD;
near so tall as she. Ile is a brave lat, and a&#xD;
likely one, too!" muttered Arnold, gazing after&#xD;
him.&#xD;
Several officers entered now, and a discussion&#xD;
ensued about the action of the day, and the&#xD;
p)lanis of the future.&#xD;
"Where is General Gates, and how is he&#xD;
pleased with the battle ?" asked Arnold, who&#xD;
a  sent his adjutant to report, lit had not&#xD;
gone himself; for there was no f. iendship be-&#xD;
tween them. Gates was jealous of his fame&#xD;
and reputation, and Arnold despised Gates, be-&#xD;
cause he was lazy and inactive, id given to in-&#xD;
temperance-which, with a military command-&#xD;
er, is a most grievous fault indeed ; benumbing&#xD;
the senses as it does, and exposing him to&#xD;
commit the grossest errors of naismanagement.&#xD;
At his quarters, with a bottle of wiie in his&#xD;
hands, and a dozenmore before him, trying to&#xD;
convince some of the prisoner officers of the&#xD;
folly which King George shows in waging war&#xD;
with the colonies !" replied the officer to Ar-&#xD;
nold's question.&#xD;
"Are io orders given to renew the battle,&#xD;
now more than half won, in the morning?."&#xD;
asked Arnold.&#xD;
"None," was the reply. "And I believe he&#xD;
means that we shall wait until we are attacked&#xD;
before lie renews the action&#xD;
Imbecile !" muttered Arnold, impetuously.&#xD;
"Why, we know not how soon Clinton may be&#xD;
on our rear, with reinforcements for him. I'll&#xD;
se the general and remonstrate with hnim&#xD;
And get nothing for your pains. bchuyler&#xD;
tried it, mind was fairly insulted !" said another&#xD;
ofhlicer.&#xD;
" Then, by Ileaven! Congress shall know of&#xD;
it. Burgoyne is fairly in our power now. If I&#xD;
had conimmand of his army, for to-morrow only,&#xD;
the sun should set upon a field of American&#xD;
victory&#xD;
"If the general should hear of your remarks,&#xD;
he would not be overpleased with them !" said&#xD;
one a ho was friendly to.Arnold, and did not&#xD;
wish to see him commit himself, fur everywhere&#xD;
there can be found newsbearers to stir up dis-&#xD;
sension, especially among rivals for fame.&#xD;
"I care not how soon he hears them," re-&#xD;
plied Arnold. "I stand ready to justify myself&#xD;
before the country."&#xD;
The conversation continued in this strain for&#xD;
sonic time : and the officers, one by one, broke&#xD;
off, aid Arnold, much to his satisfaction, was&#xD;
left to his repose.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
OT BLOOD AND COOL BLOOD-A SPICE OF TRUTn&#xD;
IN TIE EAR OF OATES.&#xD;
Another Tmorning-the 20th-dawned upon&#xD;
the opposing armies, not clear and brilliant&#xD;
like that of the day before, but doll and cloudy&#xD;
-dark and cheerless, even as the prospet of&#xD;
the beleaguered British army.&#xD;

&#xD;
THE CURSE FULFILLED.&#xD;
&#xD;
At an early hour, Arnold was afoot and with&#xD;
his horses, ready saddled for actionwaited the&#xD;
orders of the day, his impetuous enemy chaf-&#xD;
ing at the unaccountable delay. Hours passed,&#xD;
and no movement was made by the troops upon&#xD;
either side.&#xD;
At last, Arnold's patience gave way entirely,&#xD;
and bidding his aids follow him, he mounted,&#xD;
and galloped to the quarters of General Gates,&#xD;
H. found that officer seated on the little piazza&#xD;
in front of the house.*in which he had taken&#xD;
quarters, smoking a pipe, and leisurely playing&#xD;
a game of draughts with his Adjutant-General.&#xD;
Several officers were grouped near, among&#xD;
whom was General Schuyler, their faces wear'&#xD;
ing the look of mortification and disappoint-&#xD;
ment. Arnold merely bowed a hasty recogni-&#xD;
tion as he rode by them ; and reigning up be-&#xD;
fore the piazza, addressed General Gates with-&#xD;
out either saluting or dismounting, ad in no&#xD;
very respectful tone:&#xD;
"I have been waiting orders, sir, until I was&#xD;
tired, at my quarters, a d now am come to re-&#xD;
ceive them !'t&#xD;
"You can return to your quarters and still&#xD;
wait until I send them !" said Gates, coolly,&#xD;
without even removing the pipe from his&#xD;
mouth, or ceasing his moves upon the draught-&#xD;
board.&#xD;
"Are you not going to attack the enemy to-&#xD;
day, sir?" cried Arnold, exasperated beyond&#xD;
control at the indifference manifested by the&#xD;
American commander-in-chief.&#xD;
"Are you commander of this army, sir!"&#xD;
cried Gates, and a flush of anger came over his&#xD;
face.&#xD;
"No, sir--I wish to God that I was, and I&#xD;
would be playing draughts with the enemy upon&#xD;
the battle-field!" replied Arnold.&#xD;
He would have said more, but a prudent&#xD;
thought for once restrained him.&#xD;
"I need no one to teach ime my duty, sir !"&#xD;
said Gates. "I heard that you had before&#xD;
spoken of me disrespectfully, behind my back,&#xD;
but I did not believe that you had the effront-&#xD;
ery to do so to my face !"&#xD;
"I mean no disrespect to you, as mysuper&#xD;
ior, sir-but I am tired of inactivity ' p&#xD;
"Then, sir, you can go where you can find&#xD;
moreactivity if you desire it. I expect General&#xD;
Lincoln every hour, and he can take charge of&#xD;
your division, and will probably have the pa-f&#xD;
tience to await the judgment of his superior&#xD;
general."-&#xD;
"Very well, sir-give me a pass for myself&#xD;
and suite to the head-quarters of General1&#xD;
Washington !" cried Arnold, purple with rage.&#xD;
"Make out the pays forGeneral Arnold, Wil-&#xD;
kinson," said Gates, coolly, to his aid, "and&#xD;
then return and finish the game."&#xD;
Arnold received the paper, and rode with&#xD;
fiery speed to his quarters to prepare for his I&#xD;
journey.'&#xD;
"May I see you alone a moment, sir 9" said '&#xD;
young Prescott, when they arrived there.  l&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes-what do you want?" ,said Arnold, less&#xD;
gently than usual ; for every passion of his na-&#xD;
ture was excited.&#xD;
"You will forgive me, sir, and not vent the&#xD;
anger upon a poor boy which that lazy gener-&#xD;
al has excited, if I venture a little advice at&#xD;
this moment !" said he, respectfully, but firmly.&#xD;
d My cousin bade me serve you to the very&#xD;
death,and I, who would place myself in death's&#xD;
peril to save your life, ought surely to do as&#xD;
much for your honor and fame; for both I know&#xD;
to you are dear as life 1"&#xD;
"What does the boy mean ?"&#xD;
"This, sir! We are on the eve of a great&#xD;
and .decisive battle! It must come. Neither&#xD;
the enemy nor we can avoid it. They cannot&#xD;
retreat. We have cut off their supplies. They&#xD;
will soon have to fight, from sheer hunger !"&#xD;
"That is true I"e&#xD;
"Well, sir, what would the country say, if&#xD;
your envious enemies told that, on the eve of a&#xD;
great battle, in a fit of momentary anger, yon&#xD;
had left tme army. They would tike advan-&#xD;
tage of that very step to work yesurruin ; for I&#xD;
care not how high a man may have reached on&#xD;
Fame's ladder, one misstep will send him head-&#xD;
long to the bottom b"&#xD;
"By Heaven, boy, you speak the truth!&#xD;
My anger made me blind to this danger ! You&#xD;
are tIe best friend I have on earth. Yourcous-&#xD;
in did intend to act an angel's part when she&#xD;
sent you to me ! I will not leave the army&#xD;
until the fate of this field is decided, and&#xD;
here--"&#xD;
"You will win more fame than ever yet has&#xD;
graced your name!  General Gates will let tre&#xD;
best opportunities pass, and you will strike&#xD;
whenever a chance offers I"&#xD;
"But he Commands--he will get the credit"&#xD;
said Arnold, gloomily.&#xD;
"He commands from his quarters-you will&#xD;
lead in the fieldI, And do not fear but you will&#xD;
get the credit for your actions there !"&#xD;
Why, James, you talk more like a genera!&#xD;
yourself, than like a beardless boy. You should&#xD;
be in our councils of war !"&#xD;
"No, sir; I antbest where I am and can f'&#xD;
no other position-would not if I could !"&#xD;
"Well, you arc a good adviser, and my be&#xD;
friend. Ride back to General Gates wits miy&#xD;
respectful compliments, and say to him slat,&#xD;
after a moment's reflection, I have ore! ded&#xD;
sot to avail myself of his permissinr t; join&#xD;
General Washington; but will rem&amp;amp;  with the&#xD;
army at present, and will await audi o r4ers as&#xD;
he may send at his leisure."&#xD;
he young aid bowed, and, rmtcunting his&#xD;
horse, rode off.&#xD;
Tme boy has saved my haorI" mused&#xD;
Arvold. "It would have Irilad my reputation&#xD;
to have left the army at crib a tme. how&#xD;

Day af ec day wore on, and. beyond slight&#xD;
skiriihes between picket-guards, or matters&#xD;
of that art, iio action took place between the&#xD;
Brit:sl and American armies. The coriander&#xD;
of the former having fortified his position,&#xD;
waited anxiously for help from below, lpromised&#xD;
by General Clinton. But he waited all in vain.&#xD;
Cli.ton had enough to keep him busy in the&#xD;
sicioity if New York, and in Jersey.&#xD;
Meantimiie, the Aiericau army daily became&#xD;
stronger. General Lincoln arrived with a large&#xD;
force , and, true to his word, Gates gave the&#xD;

little gencr-ntV, might afford him an opportu-&#xD;
rity to serve lis country, anl prove, as he had&#xD;
often on ltfore, Iis devotion to her cause.&#xD;
But as well might lie have expected to draw&#xD;
1laod froi a tonic, as a generous thought from&#xD;

uhich aIi  stool firimaainct every assault,&#xD;
could not be shaken, sod upon its destruction&#xD;

&#xD;
Arnold, with eagle eye, saw it, sprung to the&#xD;
back of his brown war-horse, and in a moment&#xD;
was at the head of a column of his old division&#xD;
They rent the air with cheers ; and lte pointed&#xD;
his sword whither lie would lead them-had no&#xD;
need to order them to follow.&#xD;
On-on, like the black spirit of the whirl-&#xD;
wind, he sped-on, crushing everything in his&#xD;
way-on, and down went Briton and Hessian--&#xD;
on, with his invincibles in his rear, wheeling,&#xD;
ferrying here, like a band of desolating angels&#xD;
sent by the band of the Almighty, they clove&#xD;
their way !&#xD;
Burgoyne turned pale. "Where is Frazer?"&#xD;
was his cry.&#xD;
"Down with Ackland, and our bravest!"&#xD;
was the hoarse reply.&#xD;
Gates half mad with envy, sent aids to recall&#xD;
Arnold; but they dared not follow him into the&#xD;
shower of iron death through which he madly&#xD;
rode. The English began to retreat; but on,&#xD;
on, now the ruling spirit of the whole army,&#xD;
Arnold rode, following them up like theory&#xD;
king of carnage! He was now the commander-&#xD;
in-chief! In vain could the English throw for-&#xD;
ward their best men to check him. Beaten&#xD;
back into their very entrenchments, one last&#xD;
stand was made by the Ilessians in a strong&#xD;
redoubt. On, over ditch and embankment,&#xD;
leaped Arnold, followed by all who could keep&#xD;
near him. H re, alnnst alone, his horse was&#xD;
killed ; the same ieg which was wounded in&#xD;
Canada was again shattered ; but even thus he&#xD;
was victorious, for the enemy fled and left the&#xD;
redoubt when lie was alniost the only one within&#xD;
it.&#xD;
Gasping, he lay beneath his dead horse --&#xD;
smoke in clouds above him-dead men all&#xD;
around-his bloody sword grasped in his hand,&#xD;
and his eye flashing like that of the wounded&#xD;
eagle, which would strike its talons home to&#xD;
the heart of his captors-but for an instant was&#xD;
he alone. A tall horseman thundered on, and&#xD;
sprung down by his side.&#xD;
";in'ral, lim here-there's life in ye, isn't&#xD;
there ?" cried an old, finiliar voice.&#xD;
" Plenty of it; is that you, Elnathan ?" cried&#xD;
the wound hero.&#xD;
"Jest so ! It's me, gin'ral ; jest in time to be&#xD;
too late! But here comes mere of your friends&#xD;
-the enemy is licked&#xD;
Oh, for another hour of daylight!" cried&#xD;
Arnold, as they dragged him froii beneath his&#xD;
horse ; "one hour more, and they were crushed&#xD;
forever !"&#xD;
But darkness was over the field, even though&#xD;
it was won; and they bore the hero back to his&#xD;
quarters, when his services were no longer&#xD;
needed.&#xD;
Burgoyne, in that battle, lost the flower of&#xD;
his army, and all of his best officers. IIe never&#xD;
again shiewed a battlefront, but retreated to&#xD;
Saratoga, and there eventually capitulated. But&#xD;

CIIAPTER XXIV.&#xD;
TIlE PLOT DEEPENS--A LADY SEEKS AN INTER-&#xD;
VIEW WITH SIR HENRY CLINTON.&#xD;
Young Prescott had spoken truly, when, in&#xD;
advising Arnold not to leave the army of Gates&#xD;
until a ha tie was fought, he said that there his&#xD;
brightest laurels would be won. Though Gates&#xD;
gave him no credit, the army and the country&#xD;
did ! Gates wrote his dispatcnes--Arnold wrote&#xD;
none, nr di lhe need any. Burgoynle and his&#xD;
morttiel otlieers attributed their double defeat&#xD;
to Arnold, and not to Gates.&#xD;
In u''r own land and abroad, as a soldier 1nl&#xD;
a brave mian, lie then stood second to none blt&#xD;
Washinston. IIe had reached the pinnacle of&#xD;
fame ! Encvy ould lot crni-li, or mahice ruin&#xD;
himt then ! What could ?  Let ou story tell.&#xD;
It was Il-.nths later.&#xD;
Sir lllelrv Clinton strode to and fro in his&#xD;
room at thle British head-quarters in New York,&#xD;
in a state of mind! not to be envied..  The&#xD;
rebel(," as he considered the American pa-&#xD;
triots, elated with their recent success, were&#xD;
gaining ground everywhere.  Anl his govern-&#xD;
ment 1was continually bilanung him1 ad the&#xD;
Briti-hl ilers her 1for not crushing the aiind&#xD;
ending th war-whiel, from its expenditure of&#xD;
life and money, had become Very unpopular at&#xD;
home.&#xD;
An orle'rly 'entered, and said&#xD;
o A  ahy, closely veilel, wishes to see you&#xD;
upon hali ness of import e11, Si' IIenry&#xD;
A lia-lyr ind oil lu-iness ?'&#xD;
"    's, Sir henry !''&#xD;
" A huit her - t hough I am in no humor to&#xD;
talk With women!"&#xD;
The soldier disappeared, but soon returned,&#xD;
ushered in tite lady, and then retired.&#xD;
With lis custolnary politeness, the British&#xD;
general bowel and handled the lady a chair,&#xD;
while he remained standing to hear what her&#xD;
business was.&#xD;
She threw lack her veil, a+d he who had no-&#xD;
ticed her figure and ldIemued it superb, almost&#xD;
started lack at thie majestic beauty of her coun-&#xD;
tenance.&#xD;
Having described her once, we need not do&#xD;
it again, except to say that tile had but added&#xD;
to and ripened her beauty. The lady was Luona&#xD;
Prescott.&#xD;
"Whom have I the honor to address ?" asked&#xD;
the general, as he bowed a second time.&#xD;
"An Arnrican lady, sr !" was her reply.&#xD;
"If America produce 1 many as fair, I should&#xD;
fear for the loyalty of the king's officers."&#xD;
"I came not here, sir, to list is to words of&#xD;
gallantry, but upon business !" said she ; and&#xD;
the colr so rOss 111101 hr cheek, and the light&#xD;
grew brighter in her dark eye, that he knew&#xD;
&#xD;
that she was not one with whom he could&#xD;
trifle.&#xD;
"Well, lady, if a loyal officer can confer with&#xD;
a reblc lady, as you confess yourself, on business,&#xD;
1 am at your service 1"&#xD;
And Sir Ienry seated himself.&#xD;
You and your king would, at this juncture,&#xD;
be glad to create disaffeiction in the Continental&#xD;
army by the defection of one of their bravest&#xD;
and most popular officers, would you not ?" she&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
Most undoubtedly his majesty would desire&#xD;
anything which would hdl tocrush this wicked&#xD;
a11 most unnatural rebellion !' re phed the&#xD;

it&#xD;
The accession of a general officer from the&#xD;
American ranks to your cause would be desir-&#xD;

"'The only feeling wicl is stronger in wo-&#xD;

"No, sir--no man could wrong me and live !&#xD;

blhe bowesd, an-d Sir lleinry was alone,  and there was somse feeling in his tone when he&#xD;
spoke.&#xD;
-  "She has!"&#xD;
" A already, and upon so short an acquaint&#xD;
ance ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
" Yes ; but what excites you, who are usually&#xD;
so calm, James ?"&#xD;
"Only the thought that that woman could be&#xD;
so easily won," said the youth ; and there was&#xD;
bitterness in his tone.&#xD;
" Will her fortune make you all right ?" con-&#xD;
tinued young Prescott.&#xD;
"Yes; I shall owe the government nothing !"&#xD;
"Nothing?   You who have been cheated of&#xD;
rank and position, you who have been wronged&#xD;
from the first hour when you drew your sword&#xD;
in their cause! You will owe them nothing?&#xD;
No, no, you will not, and the paltry dollars&#xD;
which so trouble you now, should not count&#xD;
with them against your services. But your&#xD;
services in their cause will never be appreciated!&#xD;
I who have see them can say so."&#xD;
A packet for General Arnold," said a eerv-&#xD;
ant, entering, and handing a packet to the aid,&#xD;
and then retiring.&#xD;
"A packet for me?" said Arnold, taking it&#xD;
and breaking the seal, while the aid sat down&#xD;
and took up a book in a careless way. But his&#xD;
eyes were not upon the pages, but over them,&#xD;
and closely watching the emotions depicted&#xD;
upon the face of Arnold, as he read the first&#xD;
offer of Sir henry Clinton.&#xD;
And strange emotions were painted upon his&#xD;
face, while Arnold read the letter. Anger-&#xD;
contempt-and then a different feeling, for&#xD;
plausibly did it appeal to his injured pride and&#xD;
to his ambition. A second time he read it, and&#xD;
then a third. Then for some minutes he strode&#xD;
to and fro in thought, while his young aid&#xD;
seemed to be reading his book very attentively.&#xD;
At last he paused, and spoke:&#xD;
"James, what are you reading?"&#xD;
-An old copy of Shakspere, sir," replied the&#xD;
aid.&#xD;
"Is there any play there which depicts the&#xD;
character of a traitor ?"&#xD;
'Yes, sir, there is a most damnable one in&#xD;
the play which I am reading-it is Iago, who is&#xD;
a traitor to Othello."&#xD;
"Pshaw! a woman affair-I mean a traitor to&#xD;
his country ?"&#xD;
"None that I have yet read of, sir."&#xD;
"None yet-none yet! Leave me awhile,&#xD;
James, I an in trouble, and need rest. I wish&#xD;
to see you early in the morning-early, James."&#xD;
"Yes, sir! The matter works well !" mut-&#xD;
tered the aid, as he left the room.&#xD;
"Shall I take the offer and damn myself for&#xD;
ever if the American cause succeeds?' solilo-&#xD;
quized Arnold, as soon as he was alone. "He&#xD;
speaks truly; I have been wronged-wronged&#xD;
on every hand. That one noble heart, Wash-&#xD;
ington, alone has been Just to me. And he,&#xD;
too, who is the soul of honor, would; turn&#xD;
against me, if he saw that I had committed an&#xD;
error in my financial matters. If I were to take&#xD;
this offer, and he to fall, mine would be the&#xD;
blackest ingratitude! No, I will not take it--&#xD;
at least not now, for my marriage will enable&#xD;
me to face all creditors, and in future I will so&#xD;
&#xD;
L1i&#xD;
&#xD;
live as not to be harassed by them again ! No,&#xD;
I will not think of it, at present at least."&#xD;
CIIAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
CLOUDS ARE GATIIERING EvEIN wILE THiE nIRIDAL&#xD;
FLOWEIRS InLOOM.&#xD;
But a few weeks later. Married to Miss Ship-&#xD;
pen, one of the wealthiest and most prominent&#xD;
belles in Philadelphia, living in a style of ex-&#xD;
travagant splendor. it might have been sup-&#xD;
posed that Benedict Arnold was happy. As yet&#xD;
his fame was unsullied, and though envied by&#xD;
many, and slandered by some, none could les-&#xD;
sen him in the esteem of his commander, the&#xD;
immortal Washington. Was he happy? To&#xD;
learn, we must visit him.&#xD;
To and fro is the same room where he last&#xD;
met us, lie was pacing very nervously. He did&#xD;
not look happy, even though surrounded by all&#xD;
the evidences of luxury and the trappings of&#xD;
wealth.&#xD;
lie rang a bell, which was answered a moment&#xD;
after by a servant in livery.&#xD;
"Tell Mr. Prescott, my aid and secretary,&#xD;
that I wish to see him!" said he.&#xD;
In a short time the young man entered.&#xD;
" dames, I sent for you because I need your&#xD;
advice. In my brightest hours you have been&#xD;
my friend ; be so now when clouds darken my&#xD;
pathway!" said the general.&#xD;
Your natal star is yet in the ascendant, sir!&#xD;
It has not even reached its zenith !" said the&#xD;
young man, confidently.&#xD;
"Talk not to me of stars now, James--when&#xD;
your cousin lived I could think of such mat-&#xD;
ters of romance, but now earthly annoyances&#xD;
drive all such thoughts from my head&#xD;
Why, what have you to annoy you, gene-&#xD;
ral ? With rank and pover-tarried to the&#xD;
belle of the city, your position seems one to be&#xD;
envied, rather than one to complain of."&#xD;
" You are in error, James. I lack that which&#xD;
alone wives power to man-wealth ! I am pes-&#xD;
tered to death by duns-illy paid for my serv-&#xD;
ices, have been unfortunate insotie private&#xD;
speculations ; and now Congress is about to ap-&#xD;
point a committee to investigate my official&#xD;
acts financially. It is enough to drive a man&#xD;
to any act of treason to be so wronged by those&#xD;
whom I have only served too long and too&#xD;
well !"&#xD;
"Has not your lady a fortune in her own&#xD;
right ?" asked the aid.&#xD;
"No-not that she can command, although&#xD;
in time she will doubtless inherit money !" re-&#xD;
plied the general.&#xD;
"You ask my advice, sir, and I will give It.&#xD;
I would,,were I in your place, request the com-&#xD;
mander-in-chief to relieve me from this expen-&#xD;
sive and inactive position, and to give me a&#xD;
command !"&#xD;
"But I am not fit for field-service-.-my&#xD;
wounded leg is too weak still !"&#xD;

service-some military post-for instance, there&#xD;

" II  I that:" lie continued ; " and then when&#xD;
you think  of rry troubles and the wrongs which&#xD;
have be i don toure-do not wonder that I&#xD;
have panmii and pondered upon my answer, or&#xD;
whether to atus er it all, or to send it to General&#xD;
Washington hiwiif!"'&#xD;
Arnold watched the face of his aid very&#xD;
elreIly i. lie perirsed the document, as if he&#xD;
would reirl t hire the sentiments which he felt.&#xD;
But no uniioua n was visible upon the ever-carn&#xD;
face of t w ioun roan.&#xD;
W ien lie hil pt rushed the paper, he very&#xD;
carefully a folded it, and handed it back to the&#xD;
general.&#xD;
" What do you think of the offer?" asked&#xD;
Arnold.&#xD;
"rThat to your military talents and influence&#xD;
in the caute, it is most complimentary-to your&#xD;
honor' ns a patriot, nrost insulting!" was the&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
" Vet nit more insulting than the formation&#xD;
of this aci''ursed ('ourt of Inquiry, from those&#xD;
who should Ilie my friends !"&#xD;
"True, sir, thatis aggravating, but yet they&#xD;
may not ust ain the charges against you!"&#xD;
"TIey will-warped by prejudice and with&#xD;
the eviliece of those who wish to rise upon my&#xD;
ruin, I tel tlit they willI"&#xD;
"'The, sir, if I fell, I would not fall alone!&#xD;
Like Samenui, I would pu11 down the house&#xD;
upon thiwe u ho crushed me&#xD;
"'our aleice is good, James, and suits my&#xD;
own nature. lut how to do it, is the question.&#xD;
Set your wits to work my brave lad, and plan&#xD;
for me. So you think it safe to reply to this&#xD;
letter?"&#xD;
" I hardly know-verbally, by some trusty&#xD;
agent if at all. Letters are awkward things if&#xD;
they get into wrong hands. How did the letter&#xD;
reach you ?"&#xD;
"That is true-you are prudent and faithful,&#xD;
and whatever may be my fortune, you shall not&#xD;
be the loser  i But you asked how the letter&#xD;
reached lie. It was sent by private hand-I&#xD;
&#xD;
know not who brought it, but it bears the seal&#xD;
and crest of Sir Ilenry, and is in his hand-&#xD;
writing !"&#xD;
Yes, sir, that is evident.  Yet I would ad-&#xD;
vise you to destroy it, for you know not whom&#xD;
to trust. You have enemies who would ask no&#xD;
better chance to crush you, than to bring a&#xD;
charge of treasonable correspondence with the&#xD;
enemy ; and that, if proven, would, by the rules&#xD;
of war, be sure to bring death-a disgraceful&#xD;
death-a a penalty&#xD;
True-you understand the rules of war well&#xD;
for a young soldier!"&#xD;
"I have a good teacher, sir!  But when do&#xD;
yon expect these impertinent commissioners,&#xD;
sir ?"&#xD;
"Every hour. I have already been furnished&#xD;
with a copy of their charges !"'&#xD;
"Then, sir-it is too late for you to make&#xD;
your application for a change to West Point&#xD;
before their investigation ?"&#xD;
"Yes-but why do you urge that change,&#xD;
James ?"&#xD;
"Because, sir, if the caus' which now looks&#xD;
so dark, should fail, with such a strong and inm-&#xD;
pirtant post in your possession, you could&#xD;
make almost any terms for yourself !'&#xD;
"That is true, again. Your foresight is far&#xD;
superior to mine. Should I determine to open&#xD;
any negotiations with Sir henry, you must be&#xD;
my messenger. There is no one wlhm I can&#xD;
trust but you !"&#xD;
" And yet even I may ie faithless ?" said the&#xD;
youth, with a strange smile.&#xD;
I fear not that!  I would trust my life and&#xD;
honor with you !"&#xD;
"And yet, general, the advice I have given&#xD;
you nay ie your ruin! I am almost sorry that&#xD;
I gave it!"&#xD;
"Fear not, James, I shall never blame you !&#xD;
In truth, had you not given it, the probability&#xD;
is, that my course would be the same. I have&#xD;
borne ; wrongs enough to drive any officer to&#xD;
desperation. Others, without merit, promoted&#xD;
over me-my services forgotten, or unheeded at&#xD;
ay rate.  That republics are always ungrate-&#xD;
ful is a truth proved by every history. Mon&#xD;
archs can be just and grateful, if they will!&#xD;
But governments which change almost as often&#xD;
as the wind, possessing no stability, cannot be&#xD;
depended upon!   If this were but an empire,&#xD;
then would my past deeds have given me power&#xD;
and rank-means to feed and support my tower-&#xD;
ing ambition-for that I have such, do not&#xD;
deny!"&#xD;
"'Some gentlemen wish to see General Ar-&#xD;
nold !" said a servant, entering.&#xD;
"Admit them-Ill warrant they are those of&#xD;
whom I spoke !" said Arnold, in a bitter tone.&#xD;
"Shall I remain, or leave you, general?"&#xD;
asked the aid.&#xD;
"Remain, James, and note carefully all that&#xD;
happens and is said !" replied Arnolb. " I feel&#xD;
that a crisis in my fate is fast approaching!"&#xD;
"Your star is not yet at its height 1" said the&#xD;
&#xD;
young man, in an encouraging tone.. "Fortune&#xD;
has vet many a smile for you, and I hope that&#xD;
you will not despond&#xD;
"Never while life lasts, and I have you by my&#xD;
side !" replied Arnold, cheerfully, as ie heard&#xD;
the footsteps of the advancing company.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVII.&#xD;
ARNOLD'S DESPERATION-TIE FIRST FALSE STEP&#xD;
IS TAKEN, AND IT LEADS-WHERE?&#xD;
It was but a short time later, and to and fro&#xD;
General Arnold strode with his face flushed, and&#xD;
his whole frame quivering with excitement.&#xD;
in his hand he held the decision of the court of&#xD;
inquiry, or court-martial, which had been held&#xD;
upon him. It found hin guilty of having upon&#xD;
one occasion used public wagons to convey some&#xD;
private property of his, though he paid all the&#xD;
expenses of the teams ; and also, that lie had&#xD;
granted protection to a vessel wishing to leave&#xD;
li'hiladelphia, without consulting the comman-&#xD;
der.in.chief, though knowing the character of&#xD;
the vessel, he deemed it right. All of the other&#xD;
charges had fallen to the ground, and these it&#xD;
would seen were almost too trivial for notice,&#xD;
especially in view of what he had done for the&#xD;
country ; yet private malice so wrought them&#xD;
into crimes, that he was sentenced to be repri-&#xD;
manded by General Washington.    No keener&#xD;
pang could be infilieted upon his proud heart,&#xD;
which had already borne so much, than this.&#xD;
He felt that a reprimand from him who had been&#xD;
his earliest friend-who had been the first to&#xD;
place him in the pathway of fame, would dark-&#xD;
en his name forever!"&#xD;
I would be the last to apologize for a traitor ;&#xD;
but when all had been bright, brave, patriotic,&#xD;
up to the hour when his proud and sensitive&#xD;
spirit was galled into madness by wrong, it is&#xD;
but just and manly that all which is extenuating&#xD;
should be written down in his favor. his after&#xD;
sins were as dark and fearful as his first marks&#xD;
in the world had been brilliant, it is true ; but&#xD;
back with the eye of charity let us look through&#xD;
the cloud of darkness, upon such light as can be&#xD;
seen through it.&#xD;
To and fro, with that unjust and cruel sen-&#xD;
tence in his hand, he strode, while bitter curses&#xD;
rose from his lips.&#xD;
"Yes, James," he said, to his aid-"yes, they&#xD;
have run my cup of bitterness over! Forbear-&#xD;
ance is with me no longer a virtue. I have&#xD;
been a faithful friend to America-have poured&#xD;
out my blood like water for'her-but now it&#xD;
would afford me pleasure to fight as fiercely&#xD;
against, as I ever have for her! Yes, I am free-&#xD;
dom's foe now, if freedom is in this land. Mine&#xD;
has been the hand to help to build up the cause,&#xD;
and mine shall be the hand-the first and fore-&#xD;
most to help to pull it down I Go to Sir Henry&#xD;
Clinton, meet Iis overtures with my free assent&#xD;
-to you I leave all, and will abide by any&#xD;
agreement which you may make !"&#xD;
"Will you apply for the command of West&#xD;
Point, sir?"&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
II&#xD;
&#xD;
3   r&#xD;
Y&#xD;
e&#xD;
3&#xD;
k,&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes, and get it, if it can be procured by art&#xD;
and dissimulation! They have made me ap-&#xD;
pear as a villain ; and by high Ieaven they shall&#xD;
not be disappointed in their estimate of my&#xD;
character! I will crush them and their cause, or&#xD;
die in the attempt!"&#xD;
"Please give ate a letter to Sir Henry Clin-&#xD;
ton, to attest that I am your agent!1" said the&#xD;
aid ; and his eye flashed, and his face reddened,&#xD;
and his limbs quivered with nervous excite-&#xD;
ment, while Arnold sat and wrote the letter.&#xD;
"A little higher and his star is at the zenith !"&#xD;
muttered the youth. "And then-then down,&#xD;
down forever into eternal darkness, where infa-&#xD;
my shall crush its light, shall it descend 1"  -&#xD;
' The letter was written and given t the youth.&#xD;
At the same time, Arnold offered him a purse&#xD;
of gold to defray his expenses.&#xD;
"No, sir, keep your gold, I have money, and&#xD;
will make the British general pay my expenses.&#xD;
Ie and his master are richer than us!" said the&#xD;
young man.&#xD;
"That is so !" replied Arnold, "and fear not&#xD;
but that I will dlaw heavily upon them. That&#xD;
which I meditate and will perform, must be&#xD;
well paid for, for it is a fearful risk for me to&#xD;
run! Name, honor, all will be lostif I do not&#xD;
succeed. If I-do, then my success will gild my&#xD;
actions, and I will still be hailed as a hero ! He&#xD;
only is criminal who fails in action!  I may&#xD;
even lose my young bride !"&#xD;
"No fear of that!" said the young man, with&#xD;
a covert sneer, which Arnold did not notice.&#xD;
"She, as well as her family, are more attached&#xD;
to the king's cause than our own.  The fear of&#xD;
the confiscation of their property has made&#xD;
them endure the patriot name and cause 1"&#xD;
"I believe that you are correct in that,James,&#xD;
but it is singular that I did not think of it be-&#xD;
fore !"&#xD;
"I have seen it in a thousand things !" said&#xD;
the aid. "But let me advise you, general, not&#xD;
to reveal any of your secrets to her ; few wo-&#xD;
men can keep a secret !"&#xD;
"I will be cautious, but now away to New&#xD;
York, to Sir lien-y Clinton, disguised as best&#xD;
you can, and hurry matters through; for every&#xD;
hour that I am now in the service of America&#xD;
is to me an hour of misery !"&#xD;
"A pass through our lines might be neces-&#xD;
sary !"&#xD;
"Yes, it is well thought of! What name&#xD;
shall it be in?"&#xD;
"That depends upon my disguise. I think,&#xD;
by removing my moustache, I could go as a&#xD;
woman-as a Quakeress, perhaps I Write it as&#xD;
Deborah Brierly, if you please, sir!"&#xD;
The pass was written, and the aid hastened&#xD;
away, as if he feared that Arnold's mind might&#xD;
possibly change, or something occur to prevent&#xD;
his journey.&#xD;
"The die is east!1" muttered the general, as&#xD;
soon as he was alone. "I cannot retract now&#xD;
if I would, but it is a fearful risk. Yet it must&#xD;
be met boldly ! And why should I shrink&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVIII.&#xD;
wimAQte(ITO  AN) Tiiy REaiiNAND-TI E ivona&#xD;
ASKEDi AND GRANTED.&#xD;
There was in Gte ral Washington a loftiness&#xD;
f presence whih commianded respect alike&#xD;
froni friend and foe. A respect not allied with&#xD;
fear-a respect which no tyrant could command,&#xD;
a feeling that lie was souitlhing purer, older,&#xD;
hitter than a mere ordinary normal. Selected,&#xD;
it would seem, lv the hand of the Almiglty-&#xD;
e lucated, too, for t he very position which lie&#xD;
held, destiny marked him, indeed, to be theI&#xD;
father of a nation of freedom.&#xD;
No envious hand could blacken lts fame.&#xD;
Slander recoiled front him, like a bounding ball&#xD;
east against marble; treacht ry could not betray&#xD;
him ; and death, the merciless, spared him un-&#xD;
til his work was done, and then gntly laid his&#xD;
hand upon him, and led him away to heaven,&#xD;
to receive the reward of the just.&#xD;
And never, perhaps, 'lid Washington appear&#xD;
in more angelic light than when duty called&#xD;
him to use the word of reproof. Never, per-&#xD;
haps, except in the case of Lee, at the battle of&#xD;
Monmouth, did such words pass from his lips&#xD;
in a harsh tone. And there lie seemed to feel&#xD;
intuitively that Lee was a traitor-one who&#xD;
would have been worse than Arnold, if he had&#xD;
possessed the same opportunity, and had one&#xD;
half the provocation-for he was ten times as&#xD;
cynical, and lacked the enduring fortitude of&#xD;
the other in every point of his character. This is&#xD;
a matter of op men, it is true; but from one who&#xD;
has studied is country's history very closely,&#xD;
and also examined the prejudices of the various&#xD;
writers of that history, and found many a trace&#xD;
whereby he can track treason in men highly&#xD;
lauded, who only lacked the opportunity, not&#xD;
the inclination to be traitors. And Lee was&#xD;
one!&#xD;
But to return to my paragraph--Arnold&#xD;
stood before Washington, to receive from him&#xD;
the reprimand adjudged by the court-martial.&#xD;
The light of kindness shone warmly from the&#xD;
great chiefs eyes ; and there was a shade of&#xD;
sorrow upon his face that such a duty devolved&#xD;
upon him-for he was, and ever had been, Ar-&#xD;
nold's friend-could see his faults and allow for&#xD;
them ; while he admired his impetuous valor,&#xD;
and a natural generosity in his character that&#xD;
few others would see.&#xD;
lie spoke very kindly to Arnold, using these&#xD;
vords:&#xD;
Our profession is the chastest of all. The&#xD;
&#xD;
shadow of a fault tarnishes our most brilliant&#xD;
actions. The least inadvertence would cause&#xD;
us to lose that public favor which is so hard to&#xD;
be gained. I reprimand you for having forgot-&#xD;
ten, that in Irolortion as you had rendered&#xD;
'ourself formidable to our enemies you should&#xD;
have shown moderation to our own citi.ens.&#xD;
Exhibit again those splendid qualities which&#xD;
have placed you in the ranks of our most'dis-&#xD;
tinguished generals. As far as it shall be in&#xD;
my power, I will furnish you opportunities for&#xD;
retaining the esteei which you formerly had."&#xD;
Even before Wahington ceased to speak, his&#xD;
voice was tremtulous, and his eyes moist, and it&#xD;
was evident that he suffered as much or more&#xD;
than he to whom he was obliged to administer&#xD;
reproof.&#xD;
And Arnold must have felt the reproof even&#xD;
more deeply thain if it lad been harsher. lie&#xD;
tould have steeled his already rebellious spirit&#xD;
against that; but kind words pierce deeply into,&#xD;
a heart that is not all given over to evil.&#xD;
"General !" said lie; "you say that you will&#xD;
give me an opportinity-to regain the esteem&#xD;
which my eneimes have robbed me of! For&#xD;
the sake of the past I ask it! My wounds are&#xD;
not suflicienctly healed to endure the fatigues&#xD;
and hardships of the field ; but let me entreat&#xD;
a position where I can be free from my present&#xD;
expenses and trammeled position, and where&#xD;
future fidelity and the duties of a soldier can&#xD;
be verified."&#xD;
Washington paused thoughtfully, and looked&#xD;
Arnold in the eyes, as if he would read his&#xD;
every thought.&#xD;
" What position is there in my gift where you&#xD;
can be useful to your country, sir, and do credit&#xD;
to yourself ' ie asked, at last.&#xD;
"The command of West Point, General, until&#xD;
I am able to take the field."&#xD;
Washington hesitated a moment, and then&#xD;
remarked :&#xD;
"It is a most important post, and requires&#xD;
to be guarded with unceasing vigilance ;for the&#xD;
enemy have a desire to re-open their route to"&#xD;
('anada, by the valley of the Hudson and Mo-&#xD;
hawk. But until you are ready to re-enter the&#xD;
field for an active service, you shall have the&#xD;
position."&#xD;
"Thanks, myCeneral'"cried Arnold, scarcely&#xD;
able to conceal his joy at the result of his ap-&#xD;
plication.&#xD;
He was now on the road to complete his&#xD;
treachery ; and with all the hidden evil of his&#xD;
nature he contemplated the path without paus-&#xD;
ing to look for obstacles in tIe way.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIX.&#xD;
ANOTHER INTERVIEW WITH CLiNTON-DEEPER AND&#xD;
DARKER oRowS TIHE PLOT.&#xD;
Sir Henry Clinton, who had wondered at the&#xD;
long delay in procuring an answer to his offer&#xD;
to Arnold, was delighted at last at the reappear-&#xD;
ance of the person we have known for some&#xD;
time as James Prescott, dressed again in her&#xD;
&#xD;
woman's garb, and bearinga letter to him from&#xD;
General Arnold-offering, upon certain condi-&#xD;
tions, to leave the service of the Americans for&#xD;
that of the king ; and also pledging himself, if&#xD;
he could get the command of a post or a divis-&#xD;
ion of the army,to make dhe delivery of the&#xD;
one or the other a portion of his treachery.&#xD;
"The general places a high value upon his&#xD;
return to allegiance to the king !" said Sir&#xD;
henry, after he perused the letter of Arnold,&#xD;
"His position enabled hium to do so, sir! lie&#xD;
is trusted by Washington-the idol of the army&#xD;
-and thought much of by the people !"&#xD;
"But he has not been so popular of late?&#xD;
"Not with a few leading men and officers,&#xD;
who are envious of his talents and fame, sir-&#xD;
but they have striveinin vain to crush him;&#xD;
and you will see him i a very few days in com-&#xD;
mand of one of the most important fortresses&#xD;
in America-West Point&#xD;
The British General started in unfeigned sur-&#xD;
prise when hlie hear this declaration. ,Ie knew&#xD;
the value of that impervious post-the Gibral-&#xD;
tar of the Iludson---knew nothing but treachery&#xD;
could ever place it in the hands of the British;&#xD;
and that, when it was gained, the upper valley&#xD;
of the Hudson-the teemimg riches of the Mo-&#xD;
hawk and Schiharie valleys, and, above all, the&#xD;
free passage to Canada, which Burgoyne risked&#xD;
so much to gain, were his own. And with the&#xD;
possession of that line also, lie would cut off&#xD;
the intercourse with the Eastern and Middle&#xD;
States-deprive Washington of a large field&#xD;
for supplies for his Southern forces; and do&#xD;
more to crush the patriot power here than by&#xD;
any other means. In truth, the possession of&#xD;
the upper Hudson, and the rich region there,&#xD;
had been the British desire from the commence-&#xD;
ment of the war.&#xD;
"If Arnold will put that post in my posses-&#xD;
sion, there is'nothimg im his demand which I&#xD;
will hesitate to grant!&#xD;
He shall do it, sir !" replied the lady. "It is&#xD;
the act of all acts that I have reserved for him&#xD;
When he bas sold himself, and betrays his&#xD;
country, thea my olbjet is accomplished !"&#xD;
"You must hate him very bitterly to lead&#xD;
him to do this !" said Sir henry.&#xD;
"No act of mine has been, to him, like hate,&#xD;
sir! I have periled-my life to save his-I have&#xD;
been his best adviser so far. What my motive&#xD;
is, is for myself to keep alone. But I wished&#xD;
him to rise to the topmost ladder before lie fell&#xD;
-and he has ! He can rise no higher as a sol-&#xD;
dier, either in rank or reputation ; but one act&#xD;
of treachery will simk him forever, and then I&#xD;
shall be almost satisfied, and the ruling action&#xD;
of my life will have been accomplishe !"&#xD;
"What a strange creature is woman!--an&#xD;
angel in her love, and a fiend in her hate !"said&#xD;
the general, in a thoughtful way, but not ad-&#xD;
dressing himself to her.&#xD;
"Before you study out the character of wo-&#xD;
man, Sir Henry, we will plan out the manner&#xD;
in which this enterprise is to be accomplished&#xD;
&#xD;
-for it must be well planned, to be safely per-&#xD;
fected!"&#xD;
"Thatis very true, fair lady ; and as on Gen-&#xD;
eral Arnold's part you have full power to act,I&#xD;
shall be glad to hiave you lay out the plan b&#xD;
which this most desirable object can be effected.&#xD;
I would like if General Lee could also be ap-&#xD;
proached. He is a valuable general to the&#xD;
rebel cause !"&#xD;
"Excuse me, Sir henry, you err there. He&#xD;
is morose, self-willed, anidunpopular alike with&#xD;
officers and men. Neither he nor Gates would&#xD;
be of any real benefit to you. The latter is&#xD;
imbecile, and owes all the name he'has to for-&#xD;
tiuie, and that only. The possession of such a&#xD;
pure patriot and noble snan as General Schuyler&#xD;
would indeed be a benefit to you; for the&#xD;
Americans would yield in utter hopelessness, it&#xD;
they saw such mei as he give up or leave the&#xD;
cause. But while lie and Green. and Putnam&#xD;
and Morgan, and Wayne are true and in th&#xD;
field, your work is not done. But Arnold is&#xD;
the one you want, must have, shall have, and&#xD;
the only one with whom I will hr.ve anything&#xD;
to do!"&#xD;
"You exhibit a remarkable knowledge of&#xD;
these generals, lady."&#xD;
"Why should I not, sir ? Disgtuised, and&#xD;
acting as a confidential aid to General Arnold,&#xD;
who has no suspicion of my sex, but believes&#xD;
that Iam dead-for I represent to him the cousin&#xD;
of the one I really am--I have met these gener-&#xD;
als on and off the field. My situation enables&#xD;
me to hear the opinions of others about them,&#xD;
and to know myself how they stand-how they&#xD;
act. I am a woman, it is true ; but having&#xD;
nerved myself to a certain object, every energy&#xD;
of my mind has been kej*constantly in action.&#xD;
That one object is ever uppermost iiin my mind.&#xD;
It accomplished, and I care not what next oc-&#xD;
curs ! How this war ends-what party suc-&#xD;
ceeds, matters not to me. I serve you now not&#xD;
for gold, but because, by so doing, even though&#xD;
it benefits you, I shall obtain my object. "1!t&#xD;
I saw General Arnold raised to the pinnacle oil&#xD;
which lie stands, I worked against you-fmr-&#xD;
nished him with funds-encouraged him witi&#xD;
the thought of my love to rise, and lie sue-&#xD;
ceeded.  Then when I laid the plain which,&#xD;
with your aid, I will execute, I had the report&#xD;
of my death borne to him. I have since not&#xD;
only encouraged, but brought about his mar-&#xD;
riage with another, and one who is not unfriendly&#xD;
to your cause. All this, sir, for one object,&#xD;
and that to eternally crush him !"&#xD;
"Lady, you astonish me! Were your talents&#xD;
all enlistedagainst us, I should fear you more&#xD;
than any general that you have named. A De&#xD;
Stael and a Maintenon were dangerous foes to&#xD;
more than one government in the old world-&#xD;
you, in the same field, with all their talent, and&#xD;
a fiercer nature, would have shaken kingdoms,&#xD;
while they only ruled weak-minded men I"&#xD;

sound of the rolling drum, the cheerful bugle,&#xD;
and the shrill fife. And still following this, the&#xD;
gla I eiouts of hearty' oiced men.&#xD;
What does it mean. It is Arnold's welcome&#xD;
to the command of West Point.  his desire is&#xD;
acotiiplished-he is in possession of the for-&#xD;
tress most necessary to the American cause.&#xD;
And while he gazes upon that brave and true&#xD;
garrison-while he stands there with a flushed&#xD;
and proud face-he is calmly thinking of de-&#xD;
livering them over to the enemy-calmly study-&#xD;
ing how to do an infamous treason. And be.&#xD;
side him stands his young wife, and near her&#xD;
the babe she has so lately borne to him, resting&#xD;
in the arms of a servant, gazing with wonder-&#xD;
ing eyes upon the glittering and noisy pageant&#xD;
before it.&#xD;
Oh, if lie has forgotten the call of honor,&#xD;
patriotism, duty, all that should bind him like&#xD;
links of gold unto his country, why does not&#xD;
the thought of the sorrow which his dark acts&#xD;
must bring upon her heart-the love, and pride,&#xD;
and hope now beaming on her face, which he&#xD;
must crush-the scorn which she must endure&#xD;
with him-rise to his mind. Why does he not&#xD;
think of that day so surely to come when the&#xD;
budding youth of his child will be frost strick-&#xD;
en by that cold world which will point to him&#xD;
and say, there goes the son of a traitor !&#xD;
Madness-utter madness not to think of these&#xD;
&#xD;
things, but he is beyond thought now. The&#xD;
frenzy of wrong is in his brain: ambition to rise,&#xD;
even upon a young nation's wreck; has usurped&#xD;
all that was good in his soul he is lost, lost&#xD;
forever.&#xD;
In that group, looking on with pride at the&#xD;
grand display, is old Elnathan Goodrich, still&#xD;
chief valet to his master, but little dreaming,&#xD;
however, of his intended treachery-else he,&#xD;
humble and dependent as he is, would scorn&#xD;
him and turn away from him, even as the Jews&#xD;
did from Judas, after he had sold his Lord and&#xD;
Master into their hands.&#xD;
The troops reviewed, and dismissed, and Ar-&#xD;
nold turns away to go to his quarters-notin&#xD;
the massive fort, not within its rocky intrench-&#xD;
menta, but to more comfortable quarters in a&#xD;
mansion near by-from    whence he can more&#xD;
easily steal forth to meet the emissaries of&#xD;
America's foe, and avoid the watchful eyes of&#xD;
officers and vigilant sentinels. 1-Hi every stet&#xD;
and movement now mark the coolness and de-&#xD;
liberatioti of the man beset uon error, who&#xD;
will not turn back from the line ie has marked&#xD;
out, even though it leads alone to infamy, and&#xD;
'ruin.&#xD;
Before he gains the portals of the house&#xD;
wherein lie has taken up his quarters, he ob-&#xD;
serves a young horseman covered with the dust&#xD;
of rapid travel, riding swiftly toward him from&#xD;
"below," and a pleased smile gathers upon Isis&#xD;
face as lie recognizes his aid.&#xD;
" Al, James, I am glad to see you ?" lie cried,&#xD;
as the youth reined up his panting steed and&#xD;
dismounted. "I hope you enjoyed your visit&#xD;
to your friends -"&#xD;
"Very much, sir; very much, I thank you !"&#xD;
said the youth, as he handed the reins of his&#xD;
horse to a groom who approached.&#xD;
"Come to me in my private office as soon as&#xD;
you have changed your apparel, and refreshed&#xD;
yourself," said the general. And then with his&#xD;
fair wife leaning fondly upon his arm, lie en-&#xD;
tered the mansion.&#xD;
An hour later, he was seated by a table, upon&#xD;
which lay writing-materials, and official pa-&#xD;
pers, nani opposite to him was his confidential&#xD;
aid-upon whose calm face could be traced a&#xD;
look of intense satisfaction, while he watched&#xD;
the countenance of Arnold, who was reading&#xD;
Sir henry Chunt' a's last letter.&#xD;
"It is well-Sir Henry seems inclined to-be&#xD;
very liberal," said Arnold, as he closed the doc-&#xD;
ument, and carefully placed it ia an inside&#xD;
pocket of his coat. "When will the officer he&#xD;
sends to close our final conference, arrive ?"&#xD;
" Very soon, as quickly as possible ; he has&#xD;
chosen one with whom he can trust such im-&#xD;
portant negotiations. When one of the British&#xD;
war vessels moves up the Hudson, within a few&#xD;
miles of this post, so near as not to excite par-&#xD;
ticular suspicion, nor to get within range of our&#xD;
batteries, the officer will be on board, and will&#xD;
expect you to visit him 1"&#xD;

" taeral ! do you think I could pander to&#xD;
your  ryi:y ' cried the youth ; and a flesh as&#xD;
of weiinled feehing came over his face.&#xD;
a N, James, no, not you! You are the last&#xD;
in the world whom I would suspect of an inten-&#xD;

iur ijure himself, and lose that which lie&#xD;
cares fir almost as much as the securing of&#xD;

\ell, the oticer can meet me on shore,&#xD;
ieat tie vessel, under cover of night, both of&#xD;
us ,.ng disguised : there can be no danger in&#xD;
Perhaps not !" said the youth, thought-&#xD;
fully.&#xD;
"Well, you have done well so far, James,1&#xD;
an you tst arrange all up to the very close.&#xD;
Of course when I go, you will go with me&#xD;
"Never fear, sir, but I shall be with you to&#xD;
the s e!" said the youth.&#xD;
Illd Arnold noticed the slightly sarcastic&#xD;
tone, and ttsg flash of hate, which caine almost&#xD;
snake-like from the eyes of the youth, his sis-&#xD;
picions of some treachery to himself, of some&#xD;
itmpetling power besides a wish to serve him,&#xD;
which actuated the youth-must have been&#xD;
arouse.l&#xD;
You will personally watch for the arrival&#xD;
of the vessel, James ! It will not do to intrust&#xD;
another with a hint which might lead to the&#xD;
disecrv of our secret !"&#xD;
Yit.iwish shall be obeyed, sir!"&#xD;
"Iaho deh matter can be arranged soon !"&#xD;
stid A rnold, thouightfuI y'.&#xD;
" Wly do you feel in haste, sir ?"&#xD;
" I have two reasons. The sooner the work&#xD;
is done, and the danger of premature discovery&#xD;
is past, the easier I shall feel. Again, General&#xD;
Washington, who is son to come north to visit&#xD;
the French general, Count de loelhambeau, at&#xD;
IIartforl. has written to me, that upon his re-&#xD;
turn lie will visit this post. lie has Ctse eye of&#xD;
an eagle, and almost the perception of a god&#xD;
and if the least suspicion of intended treachery&#xD;
upon my'part falls on is uind, my star is set,&#xD;
atnd seitforever !I"&#xD;
"Could you iot turn his visit to some more&#xD;
account than all else?" said the nil, more wily&#xD;
than the fiend who seduced Eve from duty to&#xD;
her Gusd and husband.&#xD;
"What do you mean " asked Arnold.&#xD;
"A dukedom and its rental-roll might be&#xD;
yours, by one act?"&#xD;
"And that act is what, James? do not speak&#xD;
so vsaueiy."              O&#xD;
"To deliver Washington into the hands of&#xD;
the Iritish general, with this fortress.  With&#xD;
him in their power, the English would close the&#xD;
&#xD;
ci&#xD;
a'&#xD;
&#xD;
war in a month. There is no one in this land&#xD;
who can fill the place of Washington, either in&#xD;
the council or the field. With his loss the dis-&#xD;
heartened people would submit, and kiss the&#xD;
hand which smote them 2"&#xD;
" Deliver Washington !' muttered Arnold ;&#xD;
and his face grew white, and his frame shook as&#xD;
with an ague at the thought.&#xD;
"Deliver Washington to the    eadsman's&#xD;
block or the hangman's cord, or tlshat lie might&#xD;
be caged as a wild beast, and shown to wonder-&#xD;
ing eyes in Europe, as a fallen champion of&#xD;
freedom-as one hike Wallace, an lHofer', and&#xD;
Tell-who had been destined to strike for free-&#xD;
dom, and strike in vain."&#xD;
Wickr d, God-forsaken, and devilish as he was,&#xD;
Benedict Arnold shuddered at that thought.&#xD;
" lie his been my friend!" he imurmsured.&#xD;
My friend, when all else were my foes&#xD;
Yet whieni you have corst  atea yotr&#xD;
bargain withs Sir hlenry, lie witllhue the lirst amid-&#xD;
loudest to condemn you, and would sign your&#xD;
heath-warrant with an unshrimking hand l"&#xD;
I believe he woil, for ie would dueem it&#xD;
his dut, ! And from duty he never shrinks! II&#xD;
love sins, Jates, and had I iot b en so wrong-&#xD;
ed, never, never, have given ims cause as I may,&#xD;
to hate mise!'"&#xD;
Lore, sir, is a scarce thing in this world. It's&#xD;
name is very often only a cloak for deceit?"&#xD;
" True, yet you are young for a philosopher !"&#xD;
And the heavy-hearted Arnsold smile faistly.&#xD;
It is not age, sir, but experience which&#xD;
tiacls piilosophly! Btt I will go to y duty,&#xD;
thre apparoaceh of Ctse English vessel roust be&#xD;
watched!"&#xD;
Anl again Arnold was alone. "Deliver up&#xD;
Wassintgtoi"-he murmured, in seep thought--&#xD;
dehiver up my patron and friend ? It were a&#xD;
most ungrateful act, yet I will think of it ; for,&#xD;
as Jmses says, a dukedom might henisv rewvard!&#xD;
But it must he thi etjict of special negotia-&#xD;
tion ! I woil think of it."&#xD;
Oh, when the wrong is before you, never&#xD;
pause to think, for he who does, is lost !&#xD;

LUONA PRESCOTT ; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
"I have a secret and most dangerous mission&#xD;
upon which some one must be sent; and, after&#xD;
thinking of all my officers, I know of none with&#xD;
whom I can intrust an expedition that is deli-&#xD;
cate and important so well as yourself. You&#xD;
are suave in your manners, possess a diplomatic&#xD;
turn, and have nerve and courage ; and you can&#xD;
comprehend my ideas without the necessity of&#xD;
my committing them to paper."&#xD;
"You flatter me, my general."&#xD;
"I do not. I knew your worth when I&#xD;
placed you, although a subordinate, in so im-&#xD;
portant a position upon my staff as that which&#xD;
you occupy."&#xD;
"Thanks, Sir Henry ; I am ready to under-&#xD;
take the mission, provided it be honorable,&#xD;
utbelv disregarding any danger which I may&#xD;
incur&#xD;
No duty for your king should he consider-&#xD;
ed dishonorable, major !" said Sir henry.&#xD;
"'There is but one duty in war-time vhich I&#xD;
consider dishonorable, general, except that of&#xD;
unnecessary cruelty to the helplesss-such as&#xD;
the butchery of disarmed prisoners, or the em-&#xD;
ployment of sasages to scalp women and child-&#xD;
ren at a premium&#xD;
"And what is that, major ?"&#xD;
"The duty of a spy, which, in all nations, is&#xD;
considered so dishonorable that it is punished&#xD;
with a disgraceful death ! I am ever ready and&#xD;
willing to die for my king and country, but I&#xD;
wish to die a so'dier's death !"&#xD;
"The wish is honorable ; but, with the mis-&#xD;
sion which I desire to intrust you, it is q1ues-&#xD;
tionable whether you could ie considered a&#xD;
spy by the rules of war. It is true that I wish&#xD;
you to visit a rebel fortification, or, at least, the&#xD;
commander of one !"&#xD;
"Then if I do not do it under a flag of truce,&#xD;
or with arms in my hand, in net of hostility, I&#xD;
surely would be considered a spy, and so dealt&#xD;
with, if taken "&#xD;
Sir Henry looked annoyed.&#xD;
"I fear that the use of a flag of truce would&#xD;
endanger, and, perhaps, dest-oy the object of&#xD;
the errand ; in truth, I feel sure that it would&#xD;
perhaps draw suspicions upon that man with&#xD;
whom I must communicate and negotiate&#xD;
through some able and responsible officer. And&#xD;
hostilely you cannot go ; for we wish to draw&#xD;
him over to his majesty's cause, and to get pos-&#xD;
session of the fortress which he holds!"&#xD;
"May I ask, if it is not wrong to put the&#xD;
question, who this officer is, Sir Ilenry'"&#xD;
"It is Major-General Benedict Arnold !" re-&#xD;
plied the British commander.&#xD;
"Impossible !" cried Andre. "lie is one of&#xD;
the first and most desperately patriotic gener-&#xD;
als in the American army-I would as soon&#xD;
think that Washington could himself be cor-&#xD;
rupted!"&#xD;
"And yet this same incorruptible general has&#xD;
been corresponding treasonably with me for&#xD;
months 1" said Sir Henry, with a smile. "And,"&#xD;
be added, "it only wants the payment of the&#xD;
&#xD;
}&#xD;
&#xD;
moneys into his hand, and, the filling out of his&#xD;
commission, to close the act which will deliver&#xD;
West Point to us, and secure his services to our&#xD;
side&#xD;
"By Heavens ! there seems to be no honor&#xD;
in man!' said Andre, excitedly.&#xD;
"You speak as warmly as ii yen were friend-&#xD;
ly to the rebel cause," said Sir henry.&#xD;
"You know that I am not, general; but I&#xD;
am so attached to the profession to which I be-&#xD;
long, that it pais me to see a soldier sell him-&#xD;
self to dishonor, even though he be an enemy,&#xD;
and by his act renders us a benefit !&#xD;
"But, my dear major, we must not be so nice&#xD;
in our distinctions of honor, in a case like this.&#xD;
lie is but a rebel to his king, and returns to his&#xD;
lawful allegiance I"     ,&#xD;
'For a price !" said Andro, scornfully; "for&#xD;
a price, and not from a sense of duty ! ie would&#xD;
for a hrice as soon betray us again "&#xD;
" Not when a halter would hang ready for&#xD;
him upon both sides. his very treachery will&#xD;
guarantee his fidelity to us. Ifesides, having&#xD;
the coninand of the entire 'Hudson, and its ad'&#xD;
vantages, will en: ble us to close this hateful&#xD;
and unprofitable war speedily. I know that&#xD;
no warmer desire animates your heart, which&#xD;
sighs so often for old England and a loved one&#xD;
there, whose hand but awaits your return!1&#xD;
The young officer blushed deeply at this al-&#xD;
lusion, but evidently not front  displeasure.&#xD;
After a moment's thought. he d.ail&#xD;
"The defection of Arnold. and the yielding&#xD;
to us of \\est loint, woll  e invaluable in-&#xD;
del to our cause. It is sail that the place is&#xD;
almost iiiqregnable."'.'.&#xD;
That is s but the most important thing&#xD;
wil lbe its effect on the army, of which Arnold&#xD;
was a very idol. Other officers wi.l follow him-&#xD;
the men will desert-:the people despond be-&#xD;
neath the blow, and Washmigton will distrust&#xD;
all around li; for he puts more trust in Ar-&#xD;
nold than in any one else&#xD;
It will be so, perhaps, sir; hut yet indiina-&#xD;
t;on may aroute them beyond lespondence, and&#xD;
the name of traitor become so hateful, that all&#xD;
others will dread to ussunie it&#xD;
Well, major, these are points which it is&#xD;
useless for us to argue. Am  I to understand&#xD;
that you wish to decline this vision, imiport-&#xD;
ant as it is 1"&#xD;
"Sir Ienry, if you order me upon it, it is not&#xD;
for me to refuse it! I only say that it is a duty&#xD;
repugnant to my feelings as a man and a soldier.&#xD;
Sincerely-as impregnable as they say West&#xD;
Point is-I would rather be the leader of a for'&#xD;
hora hope to storm its battlements than to be&#xD;
the negotiator for its delivery by a traitor to&#xD;
the cause which lie has espoused !"&#xD;
Sir Henry seemed to be more troubled than&#xD;
ever.&#xD;
"I have no officer of high rank," said he,&#xD;
"with sufficient tact and prudence to do what&#xD;
must be done.'&#xD;
"Then, general, I must do it-give me you&#xD;

&#xD;
instructions, and make such preparations for&#xD;
my departure as you deem best," said he, with&#xD;
a sigh and look of gloom which seemed to&#xD;
shadow a presentiment of his coming doom, so&#xD;
sad and sorrowful.&#xD;
CH APTER XXXII:.&#xD;
MiDNIGHT TREASON - THE MESSENGER, AND TIra&#xD;
VULTURE IN HER NEST.&#xD;
It was night, and upon the bosom  of the&#xD;
Hludson dark and gloomy shadows lay-sha-&#xD;
dows from the black clouds in the sky over-&#xD;
head, and from the gray cliffs and tall trees&#xD;
upon the shore. And a low, gloomy ripple&#xD;
was on the waters, made by the breeze which,&#xD;
with  a S!len murmur, swept down from  over&#xD;
the western cliffs, and through the tree-tops&#xD;
upon the shore. It was a night fitting for the&#xD;
consmmation of dark deeds.&#xD;
A few miles below West Point, a sloop-of-war&#xD;
lay at anchor, lark in hull and dark in name ;&#xD;
for it was the British sloop "Vulture." She had&#xD;
crept up in the gloom of the night to that posi-&#xD;
tion stealthily, as if those who guided her knew&#xD;
how dark and unholy was her errand. But she&#xD;
had been observed from the shore, and scarce&#xD;
had her anchor dropped, when a light skiff, imi-&#xD;
pelled by only one person, left the land and&#xD;
gained her side so silently, that no sentinel ob-&#xD;
served its approach until the person who came&#xD;
in it stood upon the deck.&#xD;
Who are you, and whom do you wish to&#xD;
see ?" asked the started officer of the deck, as&#xD;
he saw this person step over the gangway.&#xD;
"Ilist, speak low-h am a messenger to Major_&#xD;
Andre, whom you have on board, and vish to&#xD;
see him !" replied the visitor.&#xD;
The officer led the way to the cabin, and in a&#xD;
moment the young aid stood in presence of the&#xD;
Adjutant-General of the British army.&#xD;
"Where is General Arnold ?"insked And'r,&#xD;
recognizing the messenger by a signal which&#xD;
had been agreed upon.&#xD;
" On the shore, but a short distance hence.&#xD;
lie will there await you," was the reply.&#xD;
Why lid he not come on board in person ?"&#xD;
said AnudrS, impatiently.&#xD;
"lie preferred to see you on shore, where,&#xD;
disguised as he is, you can both meet in safety ;&#xD;
anti would rather not trust himself in British&#xD;
hands until he held a British coiinission for&#xD;
his safe-guard, and had -delis ered over the&#xD;
fortress vhich he holds, as a proof of his fideli-&#xD;
ty to the cause lie is about to espouse !" re-&#xD;
plied the aid.&#xD;
"I do not like to leave my ship," said Andre,&#xD;
gloomily.  '' The interview might have taken&#xD;
luhace as well here. Whatever General Arnold&#xD;
may be, I would scorn to detain him here a'&#xD;
moment beyond his pleasure, when Iliad passed&#xD;
my word for his safety",&#xD;
Nevertheless, sir,"'replied the aid, "lie will&#xD;
only meet you on the shore, where hme is even&#xD;
now waiting with impatience. General Wash-&#xD;
ington is soon expected at West Point, and it is&#xD;
&#xD;
his wish to consummate matters as quickly as&#xD;
possible."&#xD;
"General Washington to be at West Point?"&#xD;
asked Andr, hurriedly. "What is the object&#xD;
of his visit there ?"&#xD;
"Merely a visit on his return from Hartford,&#xD;
whither he has gone to have an interview with&#xD;
the French generals. If matters are arranged,&#xD;
General Arnold will deliver him into your&#xD;
hands!"&#xD;
"heavens ! lie canot be quite so base as&#xD;
that-so near akin to Judis!"&#xD;
"Y" u understand him   not--when a man&#xD;
once stoops to wrong, lie knows not where to&#xD;
stop !"&#xD;
"YOu penk of his course as wrong, and yet&#xD;
aid him in it !" said Andre, eyeing the ahl with&#xD;
a look of suspicion.&#xD;
SI an only his servant in the matter !" re-&#xD;
plied the iii, carelessly. " I am paid for my&#xD;
services, and follow where he leads, or go where&#xD;
hie bidsi me&#xD;
" You say lie waits on shore for me. Will&#xD;
you pilot my boat to the spot ?'&#xD;
1 will do what is better and more safe for&#xD;
you. 1 will row you there in silence in my skif,&#xD;
which is light and small, and less-likely to at-&#xD;
tract the -ittention of wandering sei u s than one&#xD;
of your large boats."&#xD;
" It is well-1 will trust myself to your guid-&#xD;
anee, for you seen young, sind free from a&#xD;
treachery which would endanger my life."&#xD;
" thought soldiers set but'a li hIt value on&#xD;
their lives " said the aid, in a light tone.&#xD;
They seek a more honorable le-ti than that&#xD;
which{I might meet if taken within your liins&#xD;
said Andre, earnestly. " And though my life&#xD;
may not be worth much to me, it iiay he to&#xD;
another!"&#xD;
"u have you a mother ?" asked the ail, quick-&#xD;
lv mind earnestly.&#xD;
" No ! But why do you ask ?" sail Amndri,&#xD;
whoe ns wrapping his cloak around 'hisum, ani&#xD;

tie cornmsamder of the vessel.&#xD;
"kI nowm int, but as soon as possible," re-&#xD;
plied the iritish officer.&#xD;
" I tone your detention will not he lengthy,"&#xD;
said the naval officer ; ' for were are in a star.&#xD;

the cursed rebels have so mnyummiy nsked bat-&#xD;

"I hope to be tack long before daylight,"&#xD;

THE CURSE&#xD;
"I presume they would, general ; but with&#xD;
the most of the arms so placed that a select&#xD;
party could seize them, andwith the sentinels&#xD;
drugged so that at a given hour we cold in&#xD;
silence occupy the place-according to the plan&#xD;
-with a powerful force, I think there would be&#xD;
no danger of much resistance. It would then&#xD;
be folly ; and when you, their supposed gen-&#xD;
eral, ordered those who had seized arms to lay&#xD;
them down, they surely would not refuse."&#xD;
"I think not," said Arnold, "llowsoon can&#xD;
you move up troops?"&#xD;
"i Almost unmetdiately. To-morrow night, if&#xD;
it is a night like this ; for they are embarked&#xD;
in transports and vessels but a few miles below,&#xD;
atd rruld move up the stream at a very short&#xD;
mnotce."&#xD;
"I mayhave the rchestprize in all America&#xD;
vithlun the walls of the fort, or att miy own quar-j&#xD;
tears, to-morrow night," said Arnol'd, trying to&#xD;
appear careless, though let'emiibled when he&#xD;
made the announcement.&#xD;
"Ah!-iwhat is prized so highly ?" asked&#xD;
Andre', as if he knew not that the traitor meant&#xD;
George Washington-the man so great and&#xD;
good that even his enemies could not repress&#xD;
their r'evererce for Iis character.&#xD;
What would your king do if he had the&#xD;
piersm of General'Washington in his power ?"&#xD;
The same that e huts done to other great&#xD;
rebels, probally-behead him,"replied Andr.&#xD;
I asked with another meaning. What would&#xD;
hie do frr hiim iwho rendered the service of de-&#xD;
livering hin up ?'.'&#xD;
Not hreimg his agent, but only that of Sir&#xD;
Henry Clinton. I could not say," replied Andre',&#xD;
dryly.  "But ih d you asked ie what I would&#xD;
do, 1I would not hesitate in my answer."&#xD;
Arnold lid not like the looks of Andre as lie&#xD;
said this, therefore he did not press the ques-&#xD;
tion home to him ; for he dirl not care to quar-&#xD;
rel with hum then, and a rude answer might&#xD;
havi been given.&#xD;
After a brief pause, Arnold said:&#xD;
" I expect that General Washington will be&#xD;
at West Pomit to-morrow, or rather to-tlay ; for&#xD;
it is already approaching the morn of another&#xD;
day."&#xD;
"Then I must hasten to be gone. Iave you&#xD;
thie promised drawings and plans of the works&#xD;
ready for me ?"&#xD;
"They are here," said Arnold, handing him&#xD;
the pipers spoken of.&#xD;
" Are the posts where the sentinels are sta-&#xD;
tioned all marked ?"&#xD;
"They are ; and so accurate a description of&#xD;
the grounds anI all the approaches are iven,&#xD;
that no one can mitake them, much less a sol-&#xD;
dier luke yourself," replied the traitor.&#xD;
Then, general, if to-morrow night is dark&#xD;
and favorable, hke the present,,-we will make&#xD;
the attempt, The countersign ar.d parole will&#xD;
Ie-' .&#xD;
Washngton   and Congress.' to-morrow&#xD;
night. If the night is not favorable, ' Brittania&#xD;
&#xD;
FULFILLED.                               51&#xD;
and Clinton' the next. But I shall have a faith-&#xD;
ful man ready to meet and guide you; for you,&#xD;
I presume, will head the enterprise."&#xD;
"That honor i.e reserved for me by Sir henry&#xD;
Clinton," replied' Andre. "Is there anything&#xD;
else for us to think of ?"&#xD;
"Not that I am aware of," replied Arnold.&#xD;
And they rose to return to the river side.&#xD;
At that moment, a heavy, rumbling sound&#xD;
was heard in the' direction of the river.&#xD;
"Heavens! what is that?" asked Andre,&#xD;
quickly placing his papers within his coat.&#xD;
" It is a sound which I have heard too often&#xD;
not to recognize it," replied Arnold, far more&#xD;
agitated than the other. "It is the movement&#xD;
of the artillery, down upon the banks of the&#xD;
river."&#xD;
And in the very election of the place&#xD;
where I landed !"&#xD;
"Even so," replied General Arnold. "Some&#xD;
one must have discovered the vessel in which&#xD;
you came, and is planting a battery to play&#xD;
upon her."&#xD;
"General Arnold, I would not doubt you-&#xD;
but if this is a plan to involve me and mygu'-&#xD;
eriment, and perchance to take my life, yours&#xD;
shall first pay the forfeit," said Andre, sternly -&#xD;
and his hand was upon the butt of one of his&#xD;
pistols when he spoke.&#xD;
"Sir-I who never have been guilty of a&#xD;
small action, nor of this great act of treachery,&#xD;
till forced by my country to dlo it. would scorn&#xD;
so mean an act as your words infer. I would&#xD;
not be a traitor to youi; and I swear to you that&#xD;
I do not know anything more of the matter&#xD;
which now excites us than vou."&#xD;
"I will, I must believe you, general. Lut how&#xD;
can I regain my ship ?--day is actually showing&#xD;
the first gray of dawrn."&#xD;
"I know not; but here comes my aid    he&#xD;
may tell us. In heaven's name, Jaimes, what&#xD;
means that noise ?"&#xD;
"Sonic of Wayne's artillerymen, sir, having&#xD;
found out that a British vessel hd ventured so&#xD;
far up the river, have got down their light bat.&#xD;
terry to pay their compliments to her.'&#xD;
Can you not order them raway ?" asked&#xD;
Andre of Arnold."&#xD;
I impossible !" was the reply ; "for my mo-&#xD;
tives would be suspected in a moment."&#xD;
'' True; but you can row me on board iin&#xD;
spite of their fire, my brave young man," said&#xD;
Andre, appealing to the aide.&#xD;
"I could, sir, if they haid not planted their&#xD;
battery within ten feet of where rmy skiff lies,"&#xD;
was the disheartening answer.&#xD;
What can I do ? I must regain the vessel&#xD;
or get below in some way," said'Andre, passion-&#xD;
ately.&#xD;
" I will see you safe beyond our lines at every&#xD;
peril !" cried Arnold, " hut, to do it, mount&#xD;
my aid's horse, and with mne rife to my quar-&#xD;
ters ; and there, furnished with a change of&#xD;
dress, I will arrange for your safe eondvet to a&#xD;
place of embarkation below."&#xD;

&#xD;
529&#xD;
&#xD;
upon the advice of Arnold,he had left his arms&#xD;
with his uniform, behind. Thinking that their&#xD;
search might not be so thorough as to discover&#xD;
the papers in his boots, he dismounted. The&#xD;
pockets of his coat, waistcoat, and breeches, and&#xD;
even the lining of his hat, were all carefully in-&#xD;
inspected, and no evidence found whereby to&#xD;
detain him.&#xD;
"I guess he's all right, let him goI" said&#xD;
Williams.&#xD;
"Guessing work won't do for meI" said&#xD;
Paulding. "Off with your boots, sin"&#xD;
Andre turned pale as death.&#xD;
"There is nothing there," said be, "the&#xD;
ground is damp, and I shall catch cold ; I am&#xD;
not a well man now !"&#xD;
"Off with your hoots !" thundered Paulding,&#xD;
who had noticed hi agitastion. "You caostand&#xD;
on your head till this examination is over, and&#xD;
if you catch cold, we'll doctor you up !"&#xD;
Andrd still hesitated, and' Paulding rudely&#xD;
raised one of his feet, and drew the boot from&#xD;
it. As he did so, the secret came forth, the fatal&#xD;
papers fell to the ground. Paulding took them&#xD;
up, and inspected one after the other.&#xD;
"Plans of the fortification of West Point !"&#xD;
he muttered. " Countersigns, paroles, etc., etc.&#xD;
You are a British spy, sir !"&#xD;
"Not a spy, hut yet a British officer, I ac-&#xD;
knowledge," replied Andri, who saw that fur-&#xD;
ther concealment was useless.&#xD;
"You can mount your horse, sir, and we will&#xD;
take you back to the nearest post, where the&#xD;
commanding officer will know best what to do&#xD;
with you, and be better able to comprehend&#xD;
these papers than we who are poor and igno-&#xD;
rant !" said Paulding.&#xD;
"You shall no longer be poor if you will let&#xD;
me proceed to the British lines.  Nay, if you&#xD;
doubt me, go with me, and, besides this purse,&#xD;
watch, and the horse which I ride, you shall&#xD;
each have a hundred golden guineas I"&#xD;
"Mount, I say, you are our prisoner I"&#xD;
thundered Paulding.&#xD;
"I will give you a thousand golden guineas !"&#xD;
groaned Andr6.&#xD;
There was a moment's hesitation, while each&#xD;
man glanced in the flushed face of the other. A&#xD;
thousand guineas to men who scarce ever had&#xD;
handled one o sons of toil, whose hands were&#xD;
hard, and  pose brows were dark with the stain&#xD;
of labor ! A thousand guineas to them ! what a&#xD;
temptation ! It woulk buy a thousand of the&#xD;
brawling patriots of the present day - haa&#xD;
bought the editor and his press, the congress-&#xD;
man and his vote, the judge on the bench, and&#xD;
the governor in his chair I God, what a trial I&#xD;
When Andre saw this hesitation, joy crept&#xD;
within the clammy portalsof his freezing heart,&#xD;
and Hope's light beamed from his eyes. But oh,&#xD;
how quick his sudden exultation changed when&#xD;
front every lip of those priceless patriots came&#xD;
the holy words&#xD;
"asrsaa GOLD cANNOT BUT us! "&#xD;
Enshrined forever be they upon the records&#xD;
&#xD;
.,,,'&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
of all which is immortal in history ! Engraven&#xD;
be they upon every true American's heart.&#xD;
Mothers, lisp them to your babea   Fathers,&#xD;
teach them to oursons  Would to God that&#xD;
in letters of gold, visible to every eye, like the&#xD;
star they were written eternally in the sky&#xD;
above us, that they may shame the recreant&#xD;
sons of patriot sires into a remembrance of the&#xD;
duty they owe to such fathers, to their country,&#xD;
and their God!&#xD;
But I forgot the patriotic politicians of the&#xD;
present day have no God but gold-no duty but&#xD;
what is iaid for !&#xD;
"I will give ten thousand guineas to be liber-&#xD;
ated and sent on my way. One of you may go&#xD;
to Sir Henry Clinton with a note for me, and&#xD;
get the money !" groaned Andre. "I will stay&#xD;
till he returns!"&#xD;
"You will stay until you prove that you are&#xD;
not a spy ! All the gold in Eniland cannot buy&#xD;
us ; we know and will do our duty ! Mount, or&#xD;
we will help you to!" was the stern answer,&#xD;
Andr6 groaned, and his heart sunk, for he&#xD;
knew that all was lost for him, but he obeyed&#xD;
the order. He was mounted, and they return-&#xD;
ed, one leading the horse, the two others guard-&#xD;
ing him with watchful eyes, and ready arms on&#xD;
either side.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXV,&#xD;
COL. JAMESON'S WEAKNESS, ANt) ANDRE'S MES-&#xD;
SAG TO Says A TaAITRn'SI'SFE.&#xD;
There was great excitement at the advanced&#xD;
posts of Colonel Jameson, when the three brave&#xD;
and incorruptible patrolmen brought their&#xD;
prisoner in. Every man at the post was&#xD;
aroused with a feeling of pride and patriotism,&#xD;
when they learned what princely bribes the&#xD;
brave capt6rs of such a prize had scorned and&#xD;
refused.&#xD;
The colonel, impressed with the calm dignity&#xD;
and gentlemanly bearing of the prisoner, knew&#xD;
not what to do. And not being sutlicientle&#xD;
scholarly or erudite to fully understand te&#xD;
meaning of the papers found upon Andri; und&#xD;
as Arnold's name was only upon the pass, and&#xD;
he not acquainted with that generals hand-&#xD;
writing, and one who could not dream of the&#xD;
treason of so brave a man and so great a patriot&#xD;
as Arnold was supposed to be-was all the more&#xD;
easily mystified.&#xD;
When Andre requested to be privately ex-&#xD;
amined by Col. Jameson-for the major at once&#xD;
saw an advantage in such a course, for intui-&#xD;
tively he read the good and easy character of&#xD;
the man-Jameson acquiesced without hesita-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"I am glad, colonel, now that we are alone&#xD;
and free from those ignorant mep, whose' pre-&#xD;
tended patriotism was only based upon a desire&#xD;
to reahse a large sum of money, and whose&#xD;
eupidity I have fairly tested-I am glad that,&#xD;

in nyi true character !" said Andre, with a suave&#xD;
dissinulation that proved indeed how great a'&#xD;
diplomat he was. "I am not the man whom they&#xD;
believe me to be ; and, I assure you, upon the&#xD;
honor of a gentleman, that I am not, nor have I&#xD;
been, a say ,"&#xD;
The i honor of a gentleman" in those days&#xD;
was something, and not, as now, too often an&#xD;
idle wrd ; anuid what with Andro's flattery and&#xD;
this inastisolemn observation, poor Jameson was&#xD;
indeed in a qua:idary. IIn had no efficient offi-&#xD;
eer noar to aid or consult, and he was perplexed&#xD;
dreuiflly.&#xD;
.1 dear sir," said he, addressing Andre in&#xD;
the ku! bt tones, "if you are not that which&#xD;
ou utid to the men you were, pray, who are&#xD;
you r&#xD;
p rivate gentleman engaged in the patriot&#xD;
caue, with heart and foitune. I am a friend&#xD;
of t; i wral Arnold's, and his pass is genuine. I&#xD;
beg that you will at once dispatch an express&#xD;
with all eseed to him. I will write but three&#xD;
lines to lin, or you may write them yourself,&#xD;
stating only that Mr. Anderson has been de-&#xD;
tained at your post; and I have no doubt but&#xD;
that lie n'll hasten in person to assure you of&#xD;
ity true character, and of the injury my unjust&#xD;
dete nuon bty those boors han done the cause."&#xD;
"Thor- cm be no harm with the express-I&#xD;
will Cu l1 it," said Jameson; "write your note,&#xD;
whiil- I go and mount an orderly."&#xD;
"f I  erish, I can at least save Arnold, and&#xD;
enable lim, with energy, to yet fulfill our plan.&#xD;
hy ee niiisuiiiating with the troops below," said&#xD;
Andi-whose every impulse was noble, even&#xD;
though we deem Iis correspondence with Ar-&#xD;
nol,.:n the first placea crime. And he hastily&#xD;
wrote a note, so guarded that none but Arnold&#xD;
could comprehend its meaing, yet it fully re-&#xD;
vealeil thic (anger of both.&#xD;
The colonel came in a moment later, and the&#xD;
note was at once dispatched in all haste.&#xD;
After the express had been sent, Colonel&#xD;
Jatmson, knowing that General Washington&#xD;
was 'p1cted above, enclosed the papers taken&#xD;
upon Anri', and an account of his capture to&#xD;
his euc'ltency, and, mounting another orderly.&#xD;
bade it ride and meet the general on his road&#xD;
froth 1artford, and to give him the dispatch.&#xD;
is lit e returned to the room where Aadr6&#xD;
was coposetdly seated, he mentioned this act,&#xD;
and froit that hour Andrsl gave himself up asa&#xD;
lost man. Yet he kept his self-possession, con-&#xD;
versed pleasantly, and partook temperately of&#xD;
refreshments, which the good-natured and hon-&#xD;
est colonel offered him; and no one, to look&#xD;
upon his frank and manly face, would deem&#xD;
that in his heart he felt assured that a disgrace-&#xD;
ful death was his inevitable doom. He as a&#xD;
soldier well knew that the papers found upon&#xD;
his person would convict him as a spy, for no&#xD;
man in the British army was better acquainted&#xD;
with al the rules of war than he. But he&#xD;
nerved himself to meet the fate before him as a&#xD;
man and as a soldier.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXVI.&#xD;
THE ALARM--TUE TRAITOR'S ESCAPE-TnE WARN-&#xD;
ING OF LUNA.&#xD;
Arnold having been infurioed by avant-cour-&#xD;
iers of the approach of Gtneral Washington,&#xD;
made every preparation to receive the illus-&#xD;
trious chieftain with all of the honor due his&#xD;
rank and position. No one who saw with what&#xD;
perfect calmness and decision he gave all of his&#xD;
orders-even to the dressing of the officers and&#xD;
men--or noticed how carefully he made his&#xD;
own toilet, would have dreamed that he was&#xD;
already a traitor to his country.&#xD;
The preparations duly made, he returned to&#xD;
his own quarters, there to await in quiet--if the&#xD;
hell within him could leave him quiet-the ar-&#xD;
rival of Washington. All that was noticed pe-&#xD;
culiar in his conduct on that day was the fre-&#xD;
quency of his potations. lIe undoubtedly wish-&#xD;
ed to stifle feeling by the free use of spirits;&#xD;
but false is the idea which prompts such means&#xD;
to acquire the desired end.&#xD;
It was a few hours later. Washington had not&#xD;
come ; but having diverged from his intended&#xD;
route to view a spot designated for a post in-&#xD;
land, lie sent on two of his aids, to say that he&#xD;
would soon be with his favorite general. And&#xD;
while Arnold was cheerfully conversing with&#xD;
these gentlemen, and witnessing their enjoy-&#xD;
ment of the refreshments before them, the&#xD;
courier from Colonel Jameson rode up at breath-&#xD;
1. ss speed, anddhanded the general the brief&#xD;
dis patch of Andre.&#xD;
dhadta thinderbolt struck him to the heart,&#xD;
no heavier blow could have come upon Benedict&#xD;
Arnold. IIe turned white as a ghost, and&#xD;
gasped for breath. Had not his back been&#xD;
turned to the officers, they could have seen his&#xD;
guilt in his very looks. And had not the tired&#xD;
courier been busy in loosening the girths of his&#xD;
panting horse, le, too, must have noticed it.&#xD;
With a choking effort, Arnold mastered an&#xD;
emotion which he knew would be his ruin were&#xD;
it not controlled ; and bidding the orderly take&#xD;
his horse to the stable and there rest until the&#xD;
reply to the dispatch was ready, lie turned to&#xD;
the ottheers, and said '&#xD;
"Make yourselves perfectly at home, gentle-&#xD;
men ; I have a few orders to give, and then, with&#xD;
you, will await the arrival of our beloved com-&#xD;
mander."&#xD;
ie said this as calmly as if the flames of hell&#xD;
and the fear of death and dishonor were not&#xD;
burning in- his breast. Then he passed into&#xD;
another apartment where his wife and babe&#xD;
were, the young mother toying with the inno-&#xD;
cent in her lap.&#xD;
The moment he looked at them, all of the&#xD;
man that was left in him welled up in his bosom,&#xD;
and tears started to his eyes. le knew that in&#xD;
his rapid, desperate flight, he could not bea&#xD;
them with him-he knew not what their fats&#xD;
would be when hate assailed and cursed his&#xD;
name-when his vile defection should be known,&#xD;
as soon it would.&#xD;
&#xD;
LUONA PRESCOTT ; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
"What is the matter. my husband ?" asked&#xD;
the terrified wife-looking with strange fear&#xD;
upon his pale face, his quivering form, and tear-&#xD;
ful eyes.&#xD;
I-Ic stooped, kissed her and the child, and&#xD;
then whispered a few words in her ear. How&#xD;
terrible to her young heart they must have&#xD;
been. With a low moan she sunk lack in bet-&#xD;
chair and fainted. Again he kissed her cold,&#xD;
pale brow, and then hurried forth from the&#xD;
house.&#xD;
Oitside, he met the faithful Elnathan.&#xD;
Where is my aid ? he asked, hurriedly.&#xD;
"I saw him jest now a talkin' to the sojer that&#xD;
brought you a letter," said Eltithan ; "and&#xD;
then he got on a horse and rode down toward&#xD;
the river."&#xD;
" llave my horse here instantly," said Ar-&#xD;
nold, turning paler still at this news ; "and if&#xD;
any one inquires where I have gone, say that it&#xD;
is to visit an outpost."&#xD;
",lest so." said the phlegmatic Yankee.&#xD;
In a few moments more, Arnold was mounted,&#xD;
and riding madly away toward a place where a&#xD;
barge was usually moored for the purpose of&#xD;
crossing the river. his pace, when upon horse-&#xD;
back was usually so rapid, that no one noticed&#xD;
it now particularly, yet he felt as if every eye&#xD;
Was upon him,&#xD;
S on lie gained the hank of the river, where&#xD;
the boat's crew, in their cleanest apparel, were&#xD;
sitting, expatiatitiguipotn the hotnot- wich they&#xD;
hoped to have of rowing Washington, the b-&#xD;
loved of all, across the river, when lie appeared&#xD;
upon the eastern shore. But just as he threw&#xD;
himself from his horse, and ordered his men to&#xD;
take their oars, le heard his name called from a&#xD;
clump of bushes a short distance in his rear.&#xD;
Ile turned and saw a figure in white, with&#xD;
great dark eyes looming out fi-om a pale face&#xD;
uponiin, and long cutling lotks of ebon lcue&#xD;
twitting, about features a 1 too well rentein-&#xD;
bereil.&#xD;
"G d of Heaven-it is the spirit of Luona&#xD;
Prescott !&#xD;
b Beneiit Arnold, your star is set forever;&#xD;
but u-e will meet agaiti. G--o for the bloodi.&#xD;
hounds are on 'our track! Go-go ." said&#xD;
she.&#xD;
lie needed no second bidding, but almost fell,&#xD;
rather than stepped, into the boat.&#xD;
had not these boatmen      before seen him&#xD;
"rather the worse for wear," as far as liquor&#xD;
was- concerned, they would  not now   have&#xD;
been so ready to obey his orders, for tey&#xD;
thuhhtnodw le wis"lghl evtd&#xD;
thuh     htnwh      a   sihl    lvtdas gentlemanly drunkenness is politely termed.&#xD;
They had not seen the figure which he hail; for&#xD;
it was hidden from them by a thick screen of&#xD;
bush's.&#xD;
"Where-away, your honor-which way shall&#xD;
I steer ?" said the old sailor, vho at times nIl-&#xD;
ed the after-oar, and at others acted as cox-&#xD;
swain.&#xD;
"Down the river, and pull as if the devil&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CURSE FULFILLED.&#xD;
&#xD;
was after you-my business is urgent," sail&#xD;
Arnold, taking the tiller himself.&#xD;
Used to obeying orders, the mn    henit to&#xD;
their oars with a will, and the boat rushed&#xD;
through the water with great speed. On it&#xD;
went for miles, and the men began to wonder&#xD;
if their general was not really crazy,; for when&#xD;
they a ackened their speed, if but for a mo-&#xD;
ment, he noticed it, and bade them   sternly&#xD;
"Row on !"&#xD;
At !ast, as they turned a point, the dark hull&#xD;
of an English vessel of war lootied tip close&#xD;
before them. And as he saw the vessel. his eye&#xD;
flashed, and he muttered to himself: " Saved !&#xD;
SAE!"&#xD;
lut saved for what?  Why did not his heart&#xD;
a-k that?  Saved only to be known its ita u-&#xD;
diring Gatin upon earttithr-more occurs, u t'nit he&#xD;
who site his Saviour on his way to .31o:it&#xD;
Calvary ! But away with reflections, and to the&#xD;
story I&#xD;
When the crew saw the English vessel so&#xD;
close ahead, they stopped pulling ; for they did&#xD;
not believe that their general knew her charac-&#xD;
ter, or that, if he did, he would risk himself&#xD;
near hr.&#xD;
"Row on-why do you slack your oars ?"&#xD;
shtouted Arnold. iereely.&#xD;
"That is an Enghinh man-of-war, yor hon-&#xD;
or," said the old seaman, humbly touching his&#xD;
hat as a mark of respect.&#xD;
O bey my orders l" shouted Arnold, more&#xD;
fiercely thiouhetfoi'e.&#xD;
"General, you nay be willing to be taken&#xD;
prisoner by the infernal Jobiiy B .hIs, but&#xD;
il-ti e if I am!" said the hioniest coxswain,&#xD;
blutitly.               .&#xD;
"Roy on-the -first one that fatirs hies !"&#xD;
shouted A rnold, drawing his pistols:nitt-I frowi-&#xD;
in, upon the unartiied crew. " I have business&#xD;
on hoar-d of that vessel t"&#xD;
"It is no hottest business, but I will not row&#xD;
another stroke unless you hoist ait u hite flag.&#xD;
They will not dare to take us prisoners inlera&#xD;
flag of truce," said, the blunt old sitant, who&#xD;
in this exhibited ct'sider-abht  k iuvmmledge tuf he&#xD;
rules of tear. " if von don't, we'll le having&#xD;

old tars a spiral jet of white smoke tiut-~t ft-itt ,&#xD;
the brs-port of the "Vulture," a houtiurelot&#xD;

heads.&#xD;
Arnold saw that it was necessary to comply&#xD;
with the action nsuggese  by the  u  otr.&#xD;

Arnolud hastily sct-tited the ladller which had&#xD;

British commander at the gangway ; for' his&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6969-00000035"/>&#xD;
rank, indicated by his uniform, had been ob-&#xD;
served as he approached.&#xD;
"Whom    have I the honor to address ?" said&#xD;
the British officer, politely.&#xD;
"Major-General Arnold, formerly holding a&#xD;
commission in the American army, but now&#xD;
holding the same rank in the army of his Brit-&#xD;
tanio majesty. I am anxious to be conveyed,&#xD;
as soon as possible, to Sir Henry Clinton, for&#xD;
whom I have news of vital importance."&#xD;
"Are you the officer with whom Major An-&#xD;
dre, a passenger up the river with me, had bus-&#xD;
iness, sir ?" asked the naval officer.&#xD;
"I am," was Arnold's reply.&#xD;
4 May I ask, sir, where he is?"&#xD;
"lie has been captured in trying to return to&#xD;
New York, and I have been obliged to fly in&#xD;
haste from my post to escape the same fate."&#xD;
"Captured! Good God, sir! he was the&#xD;
finest officer in our army," said the command-&#xD;
er, almost overcome with feeling.&#xD;
"I cannot help it, sir. His capture occurred&#xD;
from no fault of mine. The only way to benefit&#xD;
him is to hasten to Sir Henry clinton and take&#xD;
measures for effecting his release."&#xD;
Arnold's attention was now drawn to the old&#xD;
coxswain of the barge, who, having ascended to&#xD;
the deck, stood with his hands resting upon his&#xD;
broad hips and his arms akimbo, looking at&#xD;
him intently, with an expression of the most&#xD;
bitter contempt upon his race.&#xD;
"Why do you stare at me so, fellow ?" asked&#xD;
Arnold, actually paling before his gaze.&#xD;
"I wanted to see exactly how a traitor to his&#xD;
country looked, so that I could remember it&#xD;
forever afterward," replied the noble seaman,&#xD;
with fearless candor.&#xD;
"Captain," said Arnold, addressing himself&#xD;
to the naval officer, "you will oblige me by&#xD;
putting this mutinous scoundrel and all of the&#xD;
boat's crew in irons, and detaining them as&#xD;
prisoners of war."&#xD;
And his eyes flashed and his face flushed with&#xD;
the bitterest anger as he spoke these words.&#xD;
"I hope your honor will remember," said the&#xD;
old tar, addressing himself to the naval officer,&#xD;
"thatwe are American sailors, and came along-&#xD;
side of your vessel under a flag of truce ; and,&#xD;
moreover, not of our own free will, but by the&#xD;
order of that man, whom we did not then know&#xD;
as a traitor, but believed to be our own true&#xD;
general, though we thought he acted as if he&#xD;
was three sheets in the wind."&#xD;
"Ishall not detain you, my brave lad," said&#xD;
the honest Briton. "You came under the pro-&#xD;
tection of a flag, and I would be the last to dis-&#xD;
honor it."&#xD;
"I order you to detain those men as prison-&#xD;
irs of war,,rsaid Arnold, in a rage, exhibiting&#xD;
eis British commission.&#xD;
"Your orders will be good with a subordi-&#xD;
nate military officer, on shore, General Arnold,'&#xD;
said the officer, stiffly ; "but I am a naval offi-&#xD;
oar, and only obey my superiors."&#xD;
Arnold, siasost ehoked with anger, turned&#xD;
&#xD;
3&#xD;
i&#xD;
ij&#xD;
E&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
upon his heel and entered the cabin, while the&#xD;
naval commander turned kindly to the old cox-&#xD;
swain and said :&#xD;
"My brave lad, you and your companions&#xD;
are free to return, as I said before; but first&#xD;
call them on deck, and let them, with you,&#xD;
drink a pot of good rum to the health of his&#xD;
majesty."&#xD;
"Excuse me, your honor, we will drink to&#xD;
your honor's best health forever ; but, as Amer.&#xD;
icans, true ones, wearing no false colors, we can-&#xD;
not drink to the king,!"&#xD;
"You shall not miss your rum for your scru-&#xD;
ples, my lad-call up your men. I know how&#xD;
to honor true bravery and patriotism, and to&#xD;
detest treason, whether it be under a blue jacket&#xD;
or an epauletted coat I"&#xD;
The Americans now came up and drank a&#xD;
glass to the commander's health, and then push-&#xD;
ed for the shore. After they were gone, the&#xD;
"Vulture" got under way and stood down thne&#xD;
river to New York. Meantime, almost unno-&#xD;
ticed by all on board, Arnold paced to and fro,&#xD;
suffering a hell which no mortal man can well&#xD;
describe. I shall not try. lie had learned a&#xD;
traitor's first lesson-the scorn of all honest&#xD;
men, no matter what their rank or station! -&#xD;
CIIAPTER XXXVII.&#xD;
WASINUTON DISCOVERS THE TREASON-TREATMENT&#xD;
OF MRS. ARNOLD.&#xD;
Not an hour-no, not thirty minutes had&#xD;
elapsed after Arnold left his quarters before&#xD;
General Washington arrived there. Surprised&#xD;
at not being received in a manner suitable to&#xD;
his rank, and by the commander of the post,&#xD;
his first inquiry was for General Arnold.&#xD;
No one had seen him since he rode so rapidly&#xD;
away, saying that he had orders to give.&#xD;
"There must be something wrong in this,"&#xD;
said the general, sternly. "Where is Mrs. Ar-&#xD;
nold ?"&#xD;
"Very sick," said one of her attendants ;&#xD;
"for some time she has been passing ft om faint-&#xD;
ing-fit to fainting-fit. We do not know the rea-&#xD;
son."&#xD;
"Poor lady, there must be something wrong,"&#xD;
said Washington, kindly. "Let orderlies he&#xD;
sent out in every direction to seek for the gen-&#xD;
eral. Something very unusual must have called&#xD;
him away at an hour when he knew that I&#xD;
would arrive."&#xD;
The general had scarcely given these orders,&#xD;
when an orderly rode up, covered with dust&#xD;
and sweat, and his horse nearly dead from&#xD;
fatigue."&#xD;
"A package for your excellency from Colonel&#xD;
Jameson," said the orderly. "I missed your&#xD;
excellency on the road here, and have ridden&#xD;
hard, for I know that it is very important."&#xD;
Washington took the paelage and hastily&#xD;
broke the seal. A frown, dark and terrible,&#xD;
gathered upon his face, usually so mild ; but&#xD;
he gave no other indication of excitement, while&#xD;
I he read paper after paper.&#xD;
&#xD;
When he was through with the perusal, he&#xD;
handed the papers to General Lafayette, with&#xD;
only this memorable remark.:&#xD;
" WooM CAN wE TRUST NOW ?"&#xD;
The young and enthusiastic Lafayette had&#xD;
not the command of feature and of motion that&#xD;
marked the commander-in-chief. Indignation&#xD;
and anger both found expression in his face, as.&#xD;
he read the proofs of Arnold's treason.&#xD;
"Whom    can we trust, indeed I" he replied,&#xD;
as he folded up the papers and handed them&#xD;
back to General Washington. "What shall be&#xD;
done, sir, iiow ?"&#xD;
"Double the guards at every point with men&#xD;
known to be trusty," said the general. "Send&#xD;
out scouts in every direction, end bid them use&#xD;
redoubled vigilance. If General Arnold can be&#xD;
found, have him taken alive by all means. lie&#xD;
must be made an example of. Send a strong&#xD;
escort to Colonel Jameson, with orders to con-&#xD;
duct his prisoner across the river to the strong&#xD;
post at Tappan, where a speedy court-martial"&#xD;
shall reveal who and what he is, and assign his&#xD;
punishment as speedily as possible. Let every&#xD;
movement be prompt and decisive."&#xD;
There orders were given in a tone so low, that&#xD;
none but Lafayette heard them ; and when that&#xD;
general departed with his aides to put them&#xD;
into execution, Washington entered the house&#xD;
and requested to be conducted to Mrs. Arnold.&#xD;
Uponentering the room, the lady turned her&#xD;
tearful face upon him, and, clasping her poor&#xD;
babe to her bosom, rushed and knelt at his feet.&#xD;
With a noble delicacy, General Washington&#xD;
waved to the attendants to leave the room, that&#xD;
they might not hear his words, and then he&#xD;
gently raised ier, and conducted her to a seat.&#xD;
"I did not know of his treason until be came&#xD;
to bid ne.farewell !" sobbed the poor woman.&#xD;
"I candidly believe you, madam, your pres-&#xD;
ent suffering assures me of that. I pray you&#xD;
to be under no alarm for yourself or child.&#xD;
Whatever I may thin' of the cruel ingratitude&#xD;
of your husband, rest assured that none of its&#xD;
effects shall be visited upon yourself!"&#xD;
Affected by this kindness, the poor lady wept&#xD;
yet the mor4'; and with the soft tenderness of a&#xD;
father lie sought to comfort her.&#xD;
When she was so recovered that she could&#xD;
speak coherently, she said :&#xD;
"General, I have but one favor to ask of&#xD;
you. Let me return to my parents in Phila-&#xD;
delphia, with my child, there to bury my head&#xD;
in the shame he has cast upon me, and to di~!&#xD;
I ask no more."&#xD;
"Your wish shall be granted, madam, and&#xD;
such conveyance and escort detailed to attend&#xD;
you as you would have been entitled to had&#xD;
not this unfortunate circumstance happened."&#xD;
Overcome by his noble words, the lady knelt&#xD;
at his icet and covered his hands with tears and&#xD;
kisses; but lie again gently raised her, and bid.&#xD;
ding her have no fear, but order her departure&#xD;
as she desired, he left her, more composed, to&#xD;
the care of her attendants.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXVIII.&#xD;
TnE NEWS OF ANDRE'S' CAPTURE BORNE BY THE&#xD;
TRAITOR TO CLINTON.&#xD;
With deep anxiety marked upon his counten-&#xD;
ance, Sir Henry Clinton sat in his room,-wait-&#xD;
ing to hear the result of the mission of Major&#xD;
Andr4, upon which so much depended. His&#xD;
anxiety for the public success of the mission&#xD;
was not unmingled with personal feeling, for&#xD;
he was really and deeply attached to his young&#xD;
and gifted adjutant-general, as in truth was the&#xD;
ease with nearly every one who knew him.&#xD;
When an orderly entered and announced&#xD;
that General Arnold sought an interview, Sir&#xD;
IHenry's face of gloom and anxiety brightened&#xD;
in an instant.&#xD;
"Admit him without delay I" he cried.&#xD;
The entrance of Arnold alone a nionent after,&#xD;
and with more of gloom than joy in his face, Sir&#xD;
Henry felt intuitively that something had gone&#xD;
wrong, and, as he extended his hand of wel-&#xD;
come to Arnold, he asked:&#xD;
"Where, my dear sir, is Major Andre. Does&#xD;
he not accompany you, or is West Point ours,&#xD;
and he in charge ?"&#xD;
"Alas! Sir Henry, West 'Point is not yet&#xD;
ours, and Andrt is in the hands of the enemy."&#xD;
"My God-is he lost? They will hang him&#xD;
as aspy 1"&#xD;
"Not, Sir Henry, if energetic means are&#xD;
taken and proper reprisals threatened. I have&#xD;
already sent a letter to General Washington in&#xD;
his behalf, exetilp-iting him from all blame,&#xD;
which letter I wrote while coming down on&#xD;
board the 'Vulture.'"&#xD;
For some timn' Sir henry paced to and fro, in&#xD;
too much agor.y to give utterance to his feel-&#xD;
ings. At last he said :&#xD;
"1 (ow did it happen? I pray you to explain&#xD;
all. To mne it is a terrible blow! No son could&#xD;
be so dear. If lost, not a man in the army but&#xD;
will mourn his loss, and curse all that led to it.&#xD;
Accomplished, brave, generous, high-minded,&#xD;
he was our idol, lie shrankfrom the mission&#xD;
because it might place him in a posit ion to be&#xD;
considered as a s pyli Tell me all, General&#xD;
Arnold; tell me all, now that.! am more com.&#xD;
posed !&#xD;
Arnold now explained all that lie did know&#xD;
of the matter, which was nothing beyond the&#xD;
manner in which Andre attempted to return to&#xD;
the city, and the note which he had sent Arnold&#xD;
after his capture.&#xD;
"Unfortunate-so unfortunate, when all was&#xD;
so well concerted for the surrender of your&#xD;
post !" said Sir Henry, after Arnold had con-&#xD;
eluded his brief narration.&#xD;
"All that can be done for his release by me,&#xD;
and all that I can do to prove my devotion to&#xD;

Not one of all that garrison, or of Arnold's&#xD;
private household, perhaps his wife excepted,&#xD;
felt so bitterly and suffered so keen a grief as&#xD;
old Ehnattian Goodrich. lie had been with&#xD;
Arnold through nearly all of his battles, had&#xD;
been constantly by his side, and had learned to&#xD;
look upon aits a being second only to his&#xD;
Creator. lie had not be in regularly enlisted,&#xD;
but had set'ved and acted as Arnold's special&#xD;
body-'servant-and now he felt as if he was dis-&#xD;
graced forever.&#xD;
"Jest to think of his turning' traitor! I-wish&#xD;
I'd a let lii die at liidgetield, or at Bemis's&#xD;
heights. Woe's the day I ever left New Lou-&#xD;
don with him--I shall be ashamed ever to show&#xD;

" Yet there you must go, EInathan !" said&#xD;
a sweut, voice behittid hin ; and he started, for it&#xD;
was twilight, and lie had wandered down by the&#xD;
river sidle.&#xD;
"Gracious goodness    O Lord - O Lord&#xD;
--it is the seirit of Miss Lonua !" he cried, as&#xD;
lie turned iua saw Luona Pirescott, dressed in&#xD;
the sate robe of white in which she had terri-&#xD;
lied Arnold so mttuch in his flight.&#xD;
Not a spirit, hut i-eulth anttaid blood. Come&#xD;
and take me by the hand, Einathan," she said,&#xD;
kindly.&#xD;
"''ite Lord said suomuthin' like to that after&#xD;
lie rio 'from the de'adl--I readitt in the Bible.&#xD;
Be you really a livin', Miss Lotat ?" said he, as&#xD;
he advntanced andt tuched her hand.&#xD;
"cYes, as yo see, Eunathan!"&#xD;
Anl you ulidn't die and  e buried at New&#xD;

" Yes, I know all, EInathan&#xD;
"i Bt Master J ntes was so sure of it, he e'en&#xD;
almost eried when hi' talkeul to toe of it !''&#xD;
"Mauster Jtunes was given somewhat to ly-&#xD;

is not what I want to talk to talk to you about.&#xD;
You nmst go back'to Bairbara, and tell her I'll&#xD;

" Then nse knows that you're alive ?"&#xD;
" Yi s, tn knows why I wished sty death re-&#xD;

"Butt where's Muster Jiurams, Miss Lona ?"&#xD;
"What is that there ?'"said Luona, pointing&#xD;
to soni ohjuet in the distance.&#xD;

a sharp voice behind him, in a tone so like that&#xD;
in which the "aid" usually addressed him, that&#xD;
he turned quick as thought, expecting to see&#xD;
Jaes Prescott standing before him.&#xD;
But only Lona was there, snuiling at his&#xD;
perplexity.&#xD;
He looked intently at her a moment, and&#xD;
then a sudden thought seemed to spring upon&#xD;
his brain.&#xD;
"What a cussed old foolI've been " lie mut-&#xD;
tered. "I might a know'dit all the time. Cous-&#xD;
ins ain't in the habit of looking' as nigh alike as&#xD;
brother and sister. Elinathan Goodrich is a&#xD;
pesky old fool, hardly fit to tend babies now,&#xD;
or hold open a churchyard gate to let folks go&#xD;
by. You've been Master James all the time,&#xD;
and I've often been so sassy to you. Forgive&#xD;
me, Miss Lona, for I didn't dream it was you."&#xD;
" You are not to blame, Elnatharn ; but now&#xD;
obey my orders. Say nothing about what you&#xD;
have seen or know about me, except to Bar-&#xD;
bara. Go at once; no words."&#xD;
The old man turned slowly away, muttering&#xD;
as lie went:&#xD;
"How she must have loved imnn !-the darned&#xD;
cuss that he is-to have dressed up in mian's&#xD;
clothes and follered him so. I might have&#xD;
knowed it afore. Master James was so shy of&#xD;
the officers, so proud like, 'he wouldn't have&#xD;
nothing' to say to 'em; and when We was in quar-&#xD;
ters, must have a room all to himself. 'Ihis is&#xD;
a strange world, and stra ge creeters are in it."&#xD;

"God of mercy-if mercy there is for one so&#xD;
cursed as I-what next must I endure? Andre&#xD;
is dead, and I aloneu'am blamed for it on every&#xD;
hatdl Sir Ienry Cinton shudlers when I ap-&#xD;
proaclt him, the other oflieers all shun me, the&#xD;
very women in the streets put down their veils&#xD;
when I advance, and the little children say&#xD;
that's he' as I go by. Not a soldier except my&#xD;
own corps of refuge's, deep-stained 'in sin as I,&#xD;
seem to feel the least respect fot mie, and that&#xD;
is because 1 am the head devil of them all. It&#xD;
is unbearable.  In my own ind my name is a&#xD;

Thus soliloquized Benediet. Arnold, as he&#xD;
walked in the garden in the rert' of his qmtflr-&#xD;
ters (on a soot now known as tire Atlantic Gar-&#xD;
dens in New York, front on Bradway. rear in&#xD;
Greenwich street). a few days after Ailro had&#xD;
suffered.  To look upon his sunken cheek and&#xD;
'hollow eyes, one woubl think that.like lis pro-&#xD;

himself rather than suier so. But there are&#xD;
mren who lack the courage to lie by their owna&#xD;

"I suppose," said he, continuing his solilo-&#xD;
quy, "that even my poor old mother has been&#xD;
taught to hate ine."&#xD;
"She is dead 1" said a voice close behind him,&#xD;
which made every nerve and fibre in his frame&#xD;
quiver.&#xD;
"Dead ?" lie moaned, as hi turned and saw&#xD;
Luona Prescott sanding in the pale moonlight&#xD;
there, looking herself like a spirit-messenger&#xD;
from the tormbl.&#xD;
" Yes ; the tre ason of her son was a constant&#xD;

air of glom poinervade both tone and look.&#xD;
&#xD;
An orderly entered, and said : "Sir Henry,&#xD;
General Arnold wishes a special interview upon&#xD;
a special and important matter."&#xD;
"For Heaven's sake don't have him up here,&#xD;
Sir Henry," said one of the oldest officers; "if&#xD;
you do, 1 must leave."&#xD;
"And we," repeated several others.&#xD;
"Tell General Arnold to take a seat in my&#xD;
office, and I will be there as soon as I am dis-&#xD;
engaged !" said Sir Henry to the orderly, who&#xD;
saluted and retired.&#xD;
"No, gentlemen," said he to his officers, after&#xD;
the soldier was gone, "do not think that I&#xD;
would obtrude a rian upon your company, un-&#xD;
necessarily, whom  I myself abhor.  But we&#xD;
have got him and must use him.  He is in the&#xD;
king's service now, and it is too late to help it.&#xD;
Excuse me, and pass the wine among yourselves&#xD;
until my return. Officially, I eaniot refuse to&#xD;
see hini, nor 3 ou to act wih him."&#xD;
With these words, Sir lleury left the room,&#xD;
and went to that in which Arnold awaited&#xD;
him.&#xD;
" What can I do for you, general?" he in-&#xD;
quired, as he entered.&#xD;
"I came, Sir I Ienry, to a k fir active service.&#xD;
I wish work to do  Ii ve tbeen used to activity&#xD;
and cannot live withorurt it."&#xD;
hs there any part uculir paiiit where your&#xD;

the British general.&#xD;
'There is onepoit, a port from which very&#xD;

" Yes I thiee yout toliime that you were&#xD;

" I uas,'' replied Arnold--either not noticing,&#xD;
or aflfct ig not, to notice the deep cut im the&#xD;
words of Sir lenry ; " ani for t hat r iison know&#xD;
how best to alproaeh and capture it without&#xD;

"Very well, General Arnold, you shall be&#xD;

all, and which seems to be the h rdest to be got&#xD;
by those whe seek it most, and to conic first to&#xD;
those who most dread its approach. Elnatsan&#xD;
had told her over and over againhis thousand-&#xD;
and-one tales of his fights with the Britishers&#xD;
-how he'd shot one, bayoneted another, etc.,&#xD;
ending always with a history of how that&#xD;
"cussed traitor," Arnold, had -deceived even&#xD;
him.&#xD;
And as often had he held a long Bible argu-&#xD;

of killing men,-she commenimg with the com-&#xD;
mandment, " Thou shalt not kill," and he refut-&#xD;
ing with the battles of David, front that with&#xD;
Goliah upward.   These arguments would be&#xD;
amusing to the reader I know, but no "report-&#xD;

turity, like many an exquisite "Candle lec-&#xD;
ture" of the present age.&#xD;
" Miss Lona said, when you left her at West&#xD;
Point, that she'd be here soon ?" said Barbara,&#xD;
interrogatively, on this occasion.&#xD;
"Jest sa !" replied Elinathan.&#xD;
" Well, don't you think, brother, that 'soon'&#xD;
has most gone by ! : You've been here a con-&#xD;
siderable time, and she isn't here yet."&#xD;
"Jest so&#xD;
"Well, but brother Elnathan, where do you&#xD;
suppose she is ?"&#xD;
" Iiain't got no idea, Barbara, not none in the&#xD;
world."&#xD;
"Maybe she's a trapesing after that good-for-&#xD;
nothin'~traitor vet!"&#xD;
"Jest so! But if it is, it's for no good she&#xD;
owes him. lie's got a wife nud baby for one&#xD;
thing, and another is, I tell you-she is a patri-&#xD;
,t. Crepass! if you'd seen how she fit at Bea-&#xD;
mus heights, you'd never have taken her for aj&#xD;
woman!"&#xD;
"But she is a woman, for I've seen her cry,"&#xD;
said Barbara, emphatically.&#xD;
"What's that? I've seen Gineral Schyler&#xD;
cry over a lot of women and children a suffer-&#xD;
in' when we-took Burgoyne. But he didn't cry&#xD;
none when they burned up his fine house and&#xD;
mills."&#xD;
"No ? Then I s'pose he swore some wicked&#xD;
words, didn't he ?"&#xD;
"No-he only lighted his pipe, and went to&#xD;
smoking, and said he reckoned they'd feel sorry&#xD;
for it souse day"&#xD;
"Now, Elnathan, ain't you a tellin' me a&#xD;
story ?"&#xD;
"I'll take my Bible oath that I ain't, Bar-&#xD;
bara."&#xD;
"'Then he was a real Christian man, if he&#xD;
was a soldier."&#xD;
"Jest so," said Elnathian.&#xD;
"I wish I had Benedict Arnold here jest one&#xD;
minute and a half," said Elinathan, after a long&#xD;
pause, during which Barbara's knitting-needles&#xD;
had been going with unusual rapidity, a habit&#xD;
with her when she was thinking hard.&#xD;
"You will have your wish shortly, then, El.&#xD;
nathan," said a voice at the open door,&#xD;
&#xD;
t&#xD;
&#xD;
Ii&#xD;
&#xD;
Barbara screamed faintly, and dropped her&#xD;
knitting-work on the floor, while EInathan&#xD;
jumped from his chair as if Satan had attacked&#xD;
him in the rear ; or, what is worse, a hornet had&#xD;
stung him.&#xD;
" Hevings and earth, Miss Lona, you creep&#xD;
on folks jist as the Injins used to, or our sent-&#xD;
eries at Burgoyne ; you e'en almost skeeredime&#xD;
out of my wits."&#xD;
"Provided you have any left," said Luona,&#xD;
advancing from the door-way to which she had&#xD;
so silently approached.&#xD;
"Jest so," said Eliathan. "But what did&#xD;
you say? Is Benedict Arnold going to come&#xD;
here ?'&#xD;
"his fleet will be in our harbor to-night;&#xD;
he is on his way here to burn and destroy I"&#xD;
"Thunder I i must go and 'Jarm the town.&#xD;
Colonel Ledyard is in Fort Griswold; he'll&#xD;
pepper 'em ; I nust go and stir everybody up."&#xD;
" You'll do no such thing ." said Luona,&#xD;
calmly but firmly. "You have always obeyed&#xD;
my $orders-have you not ."&#xD;
" Jest so, Miss Lona. lut-"&#xD;
"I wish and will have no buts or ifs and&#xD;
ands, in this matter. I will be ohbeyed !" said&#xD;
Luona, almost fiercely. 'It is necessary that&#xD;
he should do this last disaeefiul act to eter-&#xD;
nally damn him in the eyes of the civilized&#xD;
world, and add a deeper dye to his treason to&#xD;
his country !"&#xD;
"Jest so; that is if you say so, Miss Lona,&#xD;
but it seems kind o' hard that folks should be&#xD;
killed or burned in their bed by this murderin'&#xD;
cuss&#xD;
"And onebristian. I'd fight agin' him my-&#xD;
self, though 'twould be awful unbecomin' in a&#xD;
woman of my age and expe'rience," said Bar-&#xD;
bara, picking up one of her knitting-needles,&#xD;
and brandisliing it in ti, air.&#xD;
And I'll load iiy old nuslket, and put it&#xD;
out of his power to commit more sin1" said&#xD;
Elnathan, fiercely.&#xD;
" You will not harm him. Death is too good&#xD;
for him," said Luon, firmly. " To live, scorn-&#xD;
ed as he now is, by all the world, even by his&#xD;
own employers and associates, is a thousand&#xD;
times worse punilmsnt than deathh&#xD;
"Jest so; but he'll do so much harm if he&#xD;
lives," said Elnathan, deprecatingly.&#xD;
"No, his race for evil is nearly run.   The&#xD;
odium which wjll come upon hint for this act&#xD;
will cause the Briiish, for their own sakes, to&#xD;
withdraw 1dm from the service-at least, in this&#xD;
country."&#xD;
"But suppose, Miss Lona,-he should come&#xD;
and burn up this louse, what would become&#xD;
of us Y" said Barbara.&#xD;
"I shall be here, and lie would rather face&#xD;
his God than me," said Luona, proudly. Fear&#xD;
not for yourselves, but obey my orders im-&#xD;
plicitly, and without a doubt!"&#xD;
"If you say so, we must, Miss Lona, but I&#xD;
would so like to have just one crack at him,&#xD;
to see if the devil would protect his own1"&#xD;

Arnold, so like himi was it ; yet it was not he. b&#xD;
And after gazing upon it for a little while, she  a&#xD;
laid it down on the black table-cloth, and drew  c&#xD;
forth a package of letters dark with age and&#xD;
much worn, as if they had been read many&#xD;

"Why it is meant for myself, though I never&#xD;
wore such a dress !" said he.&#xD;
"No-it is the likeness of your father at your&#xD;

"lIow did it come into your possession ?"&#xD;
"I will tell you directly, Benedict-sit still,&#xD;

TIlE CHASE.&#xD;
&#xD;
It was Oefoher. 177. A heavy gale was&#xD;
blowing from tthe north ward. Two vessels-&#xD;
one was a ehit, the other a rakish fore-topsail&#xD;
schooner both armed-were standing off the&#xD;
coast, leavmtn the Capesof the Delaware. Both&#xD;
were unlre reef-d sails  Trie ship contained&#xD;
Benjamin Franklin. then bound on his mission&#xD;
to Fran -e -t he schooner was the gallant litt e&#xD;
Wasp. to which Barney had been transferred&#xD;
from the Uiorne'. It was singular that his first&#xD;
experience in armed vessels was in these sling-&#xD;
ing birds as P, lily called the bees.&#xD;
The Wasr convoyed Franklin's ship until&#xD;
she was well hegond the line of cruisers&#xD;
which in festel our cast at that time, and then&#xD;
her Captain, barleyey Alexander, put about to&#xD;
return to the Debaware.&#xD;
It was a clear rrorning when they re-sight-&#xD;
ed Cape Genlopen,and at the same time made&#xD;
out several sail 1a) Ing in the roads on that side&#xD;
of the bay.&#xD;
"What kind of craft do you think they are.&#xD;
Mr. Barney Y ' asked the captain, as the former,&#xD;
who was perched on the foretopsail yard,&#xD;
looked at them through a spy glass.&#xD;
"British m-n-o'-war, sir. Blast'em, lowe&#xD;
them the worst kind of a grudge I" replied&#xD;
Barney.&#xD;
"Are they heavy vessels ?"&#xD;
"Yes. sir-1'w sure one of them is a large&#xD;
frigate. and the other is a frigate or a large&#xD;
sloop-of-war"&#xD;
"Too heavy for us-I'll stand off, and then&#xD;
try the Cape May channel," said the captain.&#xD;
The breze was pretty fresh, and hauling&#xD;
more to the east ward now. But the gallant&#xD;
little Wasp st aiered along under a whole&#xD;
topsail uait-arl, foresail and jib, and soon&#xD;
was up abreast of tie Cape May channel.&#xD;
Her head was now laid for the entrance of the&#xD;
bay.&#xD;
But she was not to slip in without notice, or&#xD;
an attempt being made to bring her to. The&#xD;
British ve-sets hal evidently, from her rake&#xD;
and rig. discovered her character, and were&#xD;
under a press of canvas standing across to cut&#xD;
her off.&#xD;
"She must hear the topgallant sail," mut-&#xD;
tered the certain, as he saw that his chance to&#xD;
slip by the enrony's cruisers was slim.&#xD;
" She'll srani it, and the squaresail, too,&#xD;
sir," said Barney-" the wind is well on our&#xD;
quarter"&#xD;
The aiditionl sail was added, and with the&#xD;
bows fairly buried in foam, the little, schooner&#xD;
&#xD;
stood bravely on her course. The British&#xD;
ships, covered from the dece almost to their&#xD;
trucas with canvas, were coming up  After&#xD;
about two hours run, the leading vessel ltffed&#xD;
up, and a cloud or smoke was seen to puff out&#xD;
from her bow. Tnee the spray from a shot,&#xD;
as it strict the eater nearly a quarter of a&#xD;
mile short of the schooner, rose in the ar.&#xD;
"Too weak winded," muttered Barney.&#xD;
Then turning to the captain of the Wast, he&#xD;
said : "If you please, sir, I think our Long&#xD;
Tom could measure the distance a little better&#xD;
th in that."&#xD;
"Try it, Mr. Barney, if you like," said the&#xD;
captain.&#xD;
"Thank you, sir," replied the youthful offi.&#xD;
eer. " I owe the beef-eating rascals a grudge."&#xD;
Carefully sighting the gun. which threw a&#xD;
thirty-two pound shot, Barney applied the&#xD;
match. Although the leading ship was full&#xD;
two wiles off, the eff-ect of Barney's shot was&#xD;
to knock her foreyard in two close to the&#xD;
slings, and to derive her of the use of both&#xD;
the foresail and foretopsail for a time.&#xD;
"Splenaid. Mr. Barney, splendidly 'cried the&#xD;
captain, in delght&#xD;
" Shall I give her another, just by way of&#xD;
complitnent, sir?"&#xD;
"No, sir-not until we get further up the&#xD;
bay. Every shot we fire will deaden our&#xD;
headway-they are too heavy for us, and I&#xD;
see there is a brig larger than us standing out&#xD;
too. if the wind should die away, their noats,&#xD;
with so many men, might give us a deal of&#xD;
trouble."&#xD;
Tue three British vessels, now finding itim-&#xD;
possible to cut off the schooner before she&#xD;
would place a middle-ground between them&#xD;
over which they could not pass, for they were&#xD;
provided with tory pilots, now stood up the&#xD;
tienlopen channel, pressing every stitch of&#xD;
canvas which they could set, determined to&#xD;
overhaul her before she could reach a point of&#xD;
the river protected by the American batteries.&#xD;
But a stern chase is ever a long one. Ttie&#xD;
schooner had a little the advantage in distance,&#xD;
hot they had greatly the advantage in canvas,&#xD;
for all three carried studding sails, and the&#xD;
schooner had none On-on dashed the Wasp,&#xD;
like a deer before the hounds still keeping&#xD;
just out of gun shot until nearly night. Toen,&#xD;
as the breeze began to die away, the enemy&#xD;
began to gain.&#xD;
"It would be accursed luck if we were&#xD;
taken at last," muttered the captain.&#xD;

THE MAN.O'-WAR'S-MAN'S GRUDGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"We will not be," said Barney, calmly.&#xD;
"How can we help it if they close with us?&#xD;
They have one forty-four gun frigate, one of&#xD;
twenty-eight, and that brig has eighteen.&#xD;
There is but one way-we can run the schoon-&#xD;
er ashore, escape in the boats, and blow her&#xD;
up."&#xD;
"There is another way, sir," said Barney,&#xD;
with an air of confidence.&#xD;
"I'd thank you to point it out, sir," re-&#xD;
plied the captamn,,less assured than his young&#xD;
officer.&#xD;
"We are within three miles of Wilmington&#xD;
creek, air; I krow the way into it, and there&#xD;
is plenty of water for us, but not enough for&#xD;
them. We will be protected, in a great mea-&#xD;
sure, from their guns by the trees growing at&#xD;
the mouth, and after running up a little way,&#xD;
we can takein sail and lay the schooner broad-&#xD;
&#xD;
side on ; and if they want to come in with their&#xD;
boats, we'll take the old grudge out of them&#xD;
with a little grape and canister."&#xD;
"Your idea is good, Mr. Barney-I will fol-&#xD;
lo w it."&#xD;
"And, sir," continued Barney, "after we&#xD;
get in we can send word up the river by ex-&#xD;
press to the galleys, and they can come down&#xD;
and pepper the British, for it is likely they'll&#xD;
lay at anchor till daylight."&#xD;
"Trueagain, Mr. Barney," said Captain&#xD;
Alexander.&#xD;
In a short time, under his skillful pilotage,&#xD;
Barney had the Wasp inside the creek, and in&#xD;
a posture for defence. The British vessels, as&#xD;
he had predicted, anchored outside.   An&#xD;
express was also sent immediately to Com-&#xD;
modore Hopkins, who was furier up the&#xD;
Delaware.&#xD;

CHAPTER IIL&#xD;
Tns rnT.&#xD;
&#xD;
All that night the crew of the Wasp lay on&#xD;
their arms on deck read} for and expecting a&#xD;
beat attack. Neither Barry or the comman-&#xD;
der closed an eye. They knew that if not at-&#xD;
taeked at night, they would te, most probably,&#xD;
in the morning.&#xD;
Bt the nignt passed without an alarm, and&#xD;
before the gray cf the ocmiog dawn, thewind,&#xD;
which had been so strong, died away into a&#xD;
breeze so gentle that it hardly lifted the short&#xD;
night pennant at the masthead.&#xD;
Suddenly the boom of a sing'e gun, evidently&#xD;
of very heavy cstbre, care thundering over&#xD;
the water. In a few moment it was repeated,&#xD;
and shortly gun aftergun opened loudly in the&#xD;
morning air.&#xD;
"The Commodore is down withthe galleys,&#xD;
I expect sir,' said Brnev. "Wthyourper-&#xD;
mission, 1'd tate a boat and pull to the mouth&#xD;
of the creek. and see what is up"&#xD;
"Do so, Mr Barney, but hurry back," said&#xD;
the captain ; "if there is a chance, I wish to&#xD;
improve it "&#xD;
"Not worse than I do-mv old grudge never&#xD;
will be satisfied," said Barney,as he ordered&#xD;
a boat lowered, that he might proceed to re-&#xD;
connoitre. lie was not gote long, for ere the&#xD;
first gleam of the rising sun had reddened the&#xD;
eastern sky, be retsrnrd and reported that the&#xD;
galleys, in full force, had attacked the vessels,&#xD;
which were anchored in the river a short dis-&#xD;
tanee below the mouth of 'he creek. The two&#xD;
larger vessels were some ways out in the river,&#xD;
but the brig lay close in shore, having follow-&#xD;
ed the schooner the night previous much&#xD;
nearer in than the rest.&#xD;
There was not breeze enough to enable the&#xD;
vessels to get under way, and the galleys and&#xD;
gun boats, propelled by cars and sweeps, were&#xD;
enabled to chose their own position, and to do&#xD;
considerable execution. The British vessels&#xD;
got springs on their cah es, and prepared to&#xD;
make the best defence they could, but their&#xD;
ehanees were precarious wiibout a breeze.&#xD;
"Cant we bring the schooner into action,&#xD;
Mr. Barney ?" asked Alexander, fatning with&#xD;
impatience, as the rapid discharge of cannon-&#xD;
ry and rising clouds of smoke told him how&#xD;
busy they were outside.&#xD;
"Easily, sir-by warping," replied the&#xD;
young master's mate, who was acting as first&#xD;
officer under the commander; "and it we&#xD;
could only lay the brig alongside we could&#xD;
take her. Standing off, ane is too heavy metal&#xD;
for us."&#xD;
&#xD;
Acting under Barney's advice, and by his&#xD;
assistance, Alexander now bad the sehooner&#xD;
warped to the mouth of the-creek.&#xD;
The officers and crew of the brig were oc-&#xD;
cupied in returning the fire of the galleys, and&#xD;
watching their attack upon the larger vessels,&#xD;
and were not aware of the proxitaity of the&#xD;
schooner, until a thirty-two pound snot crash-&#xD;
ed throughtheir bulwarks, dismounting one of&#xD;
their carronades, and killing and wounding&#xD;
nearly a dozen men. It is about as comfort-&#xD;
able to be caught between two fires as it isfor&#xD;
married man to he caught by his wife kiss-&#xD;
ing a girl whom he has been courting under&#xD;
the pretence of being single. If he isn't under&#xD;
two fires, who is?&#xD;
In less than half a minute, another shot&#xD;
from the saucy little Wasp crashed into the&#xD;
brig, hitting her just above wind and water,&#xD;
and knocking a hole in her large enough to&#xD;
have shoved a man through. At that moment&#xD;
a gentle land breeze began to ruffle the leaves&#xD;
in the tree tops.  The commander of the&#xD;
schooner saw it.&#xD;
" Aloft, men, and loose the top sail!" he&#xD;
cried-" loose the to gallant-rail, too. Mr.&#xD;
Barney, clap the canvas on her-we'll board&#xD;
that fellow."&#xD;
"Good I That's the tune I like, sir. One&#xD;
more chance to take out my grudge for John-&#xD;
ny Bull, and show him what -'a Yankee brat'&#xD;
can do," shouted Barney, himself springing&#xD;
aloft tojourry the men in their work.&#xD;
Before the commander of the brig knew&#xD;
that a breeze was springing up, the Wasp was&#xD;
under canvas, and standing down upon himin&#xD;
a course which enabled her to rake him fore&#xD;
and aft, without his having hardly a chaneeto&#xD;
return the fire. The gun-boats, seeing the&#xD;
schooner come out, now centered their fire on&#xD;
the larger vessels, and left the brig to be han-&#xD;
died by the Wasp.&#xD;
"Stand by to let everything go by the run,&#xD;
and grapple as I lay her aboard I' shouted&#xD;
Alexander, as he bore down. "Mr. Barney,&#xD;
you will head the boarders."&#xD;
"Ay, ay, sir,'' was the cheerful response.&#xD;
"Strip to the waist, men-we've got work to&#xD;
do," be added, as he threw off his coat and&#xD;
bared his right arm, with which he sustained&#xD;
a keen and heavy cutlas&#xD;
Tbe next mo nent, amid the rattling of pis-&#xD;
tols and musketry, and the yells of maddened&#xD;
foemen, the hulls of the two vessels crashed&#xD;
together, In an instant, sheets and halliards&#xD;
