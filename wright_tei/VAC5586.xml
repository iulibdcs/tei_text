            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
               <p>ON an Autumn morn, in the year 1480, two cavaliers were riding through a mountainous pass in the southern part of the kingdom of Castile. King Ferdinand had just closed the Summer's campaign with the Moors of Grenada; his chieftains had returned to their fortresses, and single knights wandered whither business, love, or pleasure chanced to lead them. One of our cavaliers was Hernando Perez Del Pulgar, afterwards renowned in the conquest of Grenada. He was tall, of massive form, and fair features. His companion was of light, active frame, pale features, black eyes and beard; all his equipments, even to his plume, were of the same raven hue.</p>
               <p>Now you may ask who was this sombre knight. He first appeared in the Spanish camp before Malaga, attracting attention by his valor and seeming boundless wealth. Yet none knew who he was or whence he came. When knighted by Ferdinand; he vouchsafed no name, but said,—"Call me the Knight of Castile."</p>
               <p>"Hernando," said the black knight, "we are nearing the Castle Urena. You are free to relate your adventures; but reveal naught of my captivity in Malaga."</p>
               <p>"Fear not. But why this mystery? 'Tis strange! Men ask me, Who is your comrade? and I say I know not."</p>
               <p>"'Tis my fate; in justice to myself and others I must remain unknown even to you., Call me us usual, Alphonso."</p>
               <p>In the valley beneath them they now beheld the Castle Urena. It was built on the Southern bank of a river, and a deep moat isolated it from the shore. Gay banners floated from its towers, and strains of music fell on their ears.</p>
               <p>"Ha!" said Pulgar, "'tis a tournament!" And urging their steeds, ere long they entered Urena's gates.</p>
               <p>The court-yard was now an arena. On the left was a pavilion for the judges and nobility; on the right a staging for spectators. The Count Urena sat as umpire. He was cold and stately, haughty yet courteous. On his right were a number of knights, prominent among whom was Julian D'Leon. He was of elegant form and very handsome features; he was nephew of Antonio, late Marquis D'Leon. He had had an elder cousin, Gonsalvo, who was lost in battle some years previous. Julian, by the death of his uncle, had become Marquis, and<pb n="2-3" xml:id="VAC5586-00000002"/> guardian of his fair cousin, Maria. He was present as a suitor for Urena's only daughter, Eleanor. Francisco Varra, a boon comrade of Julian's, De LaVega, and others, filled the circle. On the left were Eleanor Urena and Maria D'Leon. Eleanor was a graceful being, with rosy complexion, sparkling eyes, and glossy curls. Maria was smaller, and very fair. The maidens were firm friends.</p>
               <p>"I wish the lists were open," said Eleanor. "Whom think you will be victor?"</p>
               <p>"I care not. D'Leon I suppose. But who comes here?"</p>
               <p>Pulgar and his comrade now approached Urena.</p>
               <p>"Welcome, Del Pulgar. Whom bring you?"</p>
               <p>"I am known as the Knight of Castile."</p>
               <p>"Ha! the Knight of Malaga! Welcome." The Marquis D'Leon regarded the strange knight with a glance of startled wonder and awe.</p>
               <p>The sports now commenced. Four knights had a tilt with lances; three were unhorsed, and Francisco Varra challenged all comers. Del Pulgar unhorsed him and then withdrew. D'Leon now entered and the Knight of Castile raised his gauntlet. "Who are you?" cried D'Leon.</p>
               <p>"A knight, as well as you."</p>
               <p>"Enough; we will fight to the death if you will."</p>
               <p>"As you please; I care not."</p>
               <p>All was hushed, as both dashed forward. D'Leon's lance struck the Knight's shoulder-plate with full force, lifting him in his saddle; but D'Leon himself was hurled from his steed senseless.</p>
               <p>Alphonso waited further challenge. Soon a huge Knight, named Jose Garcia, who came with D'Leon, entered and challenged Alphonso to battle with the axe. In a few moments they were equipped.</p>
               <p>"Are you ready?" said the giant.</p>
               <p>"Aye."</p>
               <p>"Then prepare to die!" For a time Alphonso parried his heavy strokes. At length his shoulder-plate became removed; the fastening had been broken by D'Leon's lance. "See you not I am defenceless?"</p>
               <p>"'Tis my advantage."</p>
               <p>"Would you murder me?"</p>
               <p>"As you will."</p>
               <p>"Then beware!" and be brought his axe with a quick, whirling stroke deep through Garcia's helmet, to the brain.</p>
               <p>Urena now proclaimed him victor, and bade him receive his guerdon at the hands of Eleanor. Kneeling at her feet, she threw a silken scarf over his shoulders. Then all adjourned to the banquet hall, where Alphonso held the seat of honor by Eleanor's side, much to the discomfiture of the Marquis D'Leon. They conversed on various topics, but though he seemed versed in affairs of camp and court, she could gain naught of his name or destiny. Nor was Maria more successful with Del Pulgar. Thus the Lady Eleanor retired with a brain busy in conjecture of the stranger.</p>
               <p>When Alphonso and Pulgar retired, Pulgar soon slept; but Alphonso, startled by a slight grating noise, saw a large portrait move aside on the outer wall, and the Marquis D'Leon peer forth. In a moment Pedrillo, an attendant of the Marquis, stepped into the room. The new comer took a flask of wine that was standing on the table and emptied a vial into it, and quickly departed. When Alphonso awoke in the morn, Pulgar was just raising a goblet of the wine to his lips.</p>
               <p>"Hold! on your life!" he shouted, and rising, while Pulgar, wondering, obeyed, he dipped a jeweled ring in the wine; when withdrawn, it was no longer brilliant.</p>
               <p>"What means this?" said Pulgar.</p>
               <p>He then explained, and they determined to leave without delay.</p>
               <p>At the morning repast, Alphonso announced their departure to Urena, and turning to Eleanor said in a low tone, "Can I hope that you will remember the stranger when he has gone to the warrior's grave?"</p>
               <p>"Aye, you are not easily forgotten."</p>
               <p>"Keep this ring in remembrance, till we meet again, if ever."</p>
               <p>"I will. But why such hurry to leave?"</p>
               <p>"Reasons I cannot divulge; so farewell!"</p>
               <p>When the knights left Urena, as they crossed the plain and rode up the mountain side, they saw a small body of armed men following them. It was Pedrillo with six of D'Leon's retainers. Mistrusting hostile pursuit, the knights halted in a level, sheltered nook, and awaited the comers. They soon appeared, and attacked them without parley or delay. The comrades parried their lances and plied their axes so well, that ere long the six were all slain, and their leader galloping away for his life.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile D'Leon bad been closeted with Urena. A union of their families was a pet project of Urena's for many reasons. D'Leon left the Count in high spirits, for he had pledged him Eleanor's hand. Stopping out on a terrace, he beheld Pedrillo coming at full speed. Meeting him in the court-yard, he said, "So soon back! Did they flee?"</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>"Did you bid them bury the knights?"</p>
               <p>"'Twas little use, bidding dead men."</p>
               <p>"Dead men! What mean you?"</p>
               <p>"Mean! nothing, only, my men were all slain, and those demons rode away unharmed." D'Leon cursed and fumed awhile, then bade Pedrillo bury the men quietly.</p>
               <p>Eleanor had a page, Fernando, a sprightly youth of sixteen, who chanced to be rambling among the hills that morn, and seeing the Knights and the pursuing party, watched their movements, and unseen witnessed the conflict. In the afternoon he returned and related the scene to his mistress. She listened with surprise, and bade him keep silence on the subject.</p>
               <p>In the evening D'Leon found Eleanor alone, and kneeling at her feet, poured forth his tale of love. She listened in silence, and replied in a calm tone, assuring him, that she could not return his love. D'Leon was surprised: though he plead in lovers' style, he expected not refusal. In vain did he urge his suit: baffled and chagrined, he departed.</p>
               <p>Ere long her father entered. "Eleanor," said he, "do you refuse D'Leon's suit! What mean you?"</p>
               <p>"I mean as I told him. I love him not."</p>
               <p>"And why! Is he not young, brave, fair, and wealthy?"</p>
               <p>He may be; but I love him not."</p>
               <p>"Love! Daughter, this is folly; your hand is pledged on my honor, and wedded you must and shall be."</p>
               <pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC5586-00000003"/>
               <p>"Never! never, with him."</p>
               <p>"By heavens, you shall! Think not thus to thwart my plans!" And so saying, he departed.</p>
               <p>A week passed at Urena. Eleanor so resisted her father's commands that he told D'Leon to drop his suit for a time. One evening Eleanor sat in her chamber in a deep slumber, when Pedrillo boldly entered with D'Leon. The Marquis took her in his arms, and entering a secret passage in the corridor, they soon emerged beside the moat, outside the castle, where a boat with two men awaited them. D'Leon bade Pedrillo bear her to the Castle Leon, and return quickly. The boat landed below, where three steeds awaited them. Pedrillo bore Eleanor, and they rode rapidly among the hills many miles, when they suddenly met a band of Moorish scouts. Pedrillo, slipped from his saddle, placed Eleanor on the ground, and dashed into a thicket, while his comrades were instantly slain. The Moors raised Eleanor, and rode away with their captive and captured steeds. At early morn Pedrillo arrived at Urena. D'Leon, cursed him at his tale, but seeing that all was lost, and none could tell of his deeds, became calm.</p>
               <p>Great was the excitement at Urena when Eleanor was missed. The whole country around was searched, but no trace to the mystery could be found. </p>
               <p>High among the mountains, near the Moorish city Baza, stood the Castle Zali. Abdalla El Gazan, its chieftain, though young, and withal a gallant, was a thorough warrior, and kept many scouts in the mountains, on the alert for enemy or plunder. It was one of his bands that met Pedrillo. On the next evening a scout reported the tale.</p>
               <p>"Is the maiden fair? Bring her hither."</p>
               <p>Ere long Eleanor was ushered into his apartments. He addressed her in Spanish, saying, "Welcome, fair maiden; fear not; you shall be treated with all courtesy. How came you among the mountains?"</p>
               <p>"I know not. But tell me, where am I?"</p>
               <p>"In the fortress Zali. Who are you?"</p>
               <p>"I am daughter of Count Urena."</p>
               <p>"Ha! How came you asleep on the mountains?"</p>
               <p>"I went to sleep in my father's castle. I awoke a captive. I know no more!"</p>
               <p>"Abducted and drugged! But rest at ease; you shall be treated as befits your rank." He bade a Moorish maiden await her. When gone, he murmured, "Beautiful as an houri! I must win her if possible."</p>
               <p>In due time Alphonso and Pulgar arrived at the camp of Ferdinand, at Cordova. Alphonso bore dispatches from the Governor of Malaga, and they visited the King, whom they found unattended except <choice>

               <p>"Welcome, brave knights. You bring important news. Perchance I may have a mission for you, Sir Mystery, that requires skill and secrecy."</p>
               <p>"We are at your service."</p>
               <p>"I doubt it not. Come hither to-morrow night."</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, the priest, Father Ambrose, had been gazing earnestly, with a startled expression, on Alphonso's features. When they departed, he drew down his cowl and sallied out in pursuit,—following them to their lodgings.</p>
               <p>In the evening Father Ambrose visited Alphonso. "Pardon my intrusion. I feel a strange interest in your welfare, and come to offer you some advice, if acceptable."</p>
               <p>"It ill becomes me to reject the friendship of one of your calling."</p>
               <p>"You speak wisely for youth. I want no knowledge of your secrets on <choice>

               <p>"Ha! what know you of D'Leon?"</p>
               <p>"No good; so be watchful of him. He is already jealous of you, for you found favor with Urena's daughter."</p>
               <p>"Really, your means of information are to be envied."</p>
               <p>"They are reliable, at all events."</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <p>On the next night Pulgar and Alphonso visited the King, who proposed that they should attempt the capture of the fortress Zali, the key of Baza. They pledged themselves to surprise it if possible.</p>
               <p>We will now pass over a month. Among the mountains near Baza was a small camp of Christians. It was the Knight of Castile, and Pulgar with his retainers. Their tents were in thickets; they made no fires and had no horses; all was still; naught to indicate their presence.</p>
               <p>Well disguised as a Moorish merchant, Alphonso left the camp to visit the Infidel stronghold, having concerted a plan of action with Pulgar. A few hours later he was ushered into Abdalla's presence, to whom he represented himself as a Moorish merchant who had been driven from Malaga, and cruelly wronged by the Christians. He talked of revenge, and proposed to Abdalla, a plan for capturing the fortress Alhama, alleging that he had a brother-in-law there who was a renegade Moor, whose assistance he could obtain.</p>
               <p>Abdalla was highly pleased with his plan, and bade him make himself free in the castle. During the afternoon he paced the castle walls talking with the sentinels.</p>
               <p>On that evening Abdalla sought Eleanor. "Fair maiden," said he, "entranced by your beauty, I have learned to love. Can you return my love? I have wealth, rank, untiring ambition; all are laid at your feet if you will become my bride."</p>
               <p>"Arise! It cannot be; we are of different faith."</p>
               <p>"Love overcomes all scruples of creed."</p>
               <p>"Would you become a Christian?"</p>
               <p>"Ha! No. You would not respect a renegade."</p>
               <p>"Nay. So pain me no farther, I pray."</p>
               <p>"Then farewell for to-day. I hope for better favor."</p>
               <p>On the next evening Alphonso walked out on the northern battlements and tarried late in converse with a sentinel, till they heard the<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC5586-00000004"/> hooting of a large owl in the ravine below. The sentinel gazed over the parapet and Alphonso dealt him a heavy blow, stunning him instantly. Drawing a cord from his bosom, with a weight attached, he lowered it to the ground. It was seized, and drawing it up he fastened the grappling of a rope ladder to the parapet. With a vial of fluid he washed the tawny hue from his features and threw off his robes. In a moment more Pulgar stepped on the terrace, bringing Alphonso's armor; his retainers silently following, till a hundred were assembled. Alphonso bade them follow him quickly. A sentinel now gave the alarm. With a loud shout they rushed for the great guard-room where the startled Moors were arming.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile we will -turn to another scene. Abdalla again visited Eleanor. "Lovely one," said he, "will no entreaty induce you to love me?"</p>
               <p>"Pain me not; I have already told you."</p>
               <p>"Cruel maiden! Do you love another?"</p>
               <p>"That you have no right to know."</p>
               <p>Ha! I see how it is. By heavens you shall be mine; you shall never escape me."</p>
               <p>With a low cry she sank upon her seat. As Abdalla spoke, loud shouts and fierce yells, with the clash of weapons, fell upon his ears. Amazed he heard the cry of "Isabella for Spain." Grasping his scimitar he rushed to the guard room. There the conflict was short and fierce. The light helmets and scimitars of the Moor, were of no avail before the axe and broadsword. Abdalla rallied his men, but they soon yielded, flying from hall to chamber. Abdalla bounded away toward Eleanor's apartment. The Knight of Castile, intent on his capture, hurried after him, and coming to the open apartment saw the Moor bearing a Christian maiden into a passage in the outer wall.</p>
               <p>"Hold! Infidel, or die!" he shouted.</p>
               <p>"Too late, sir Christian," and he seized the spring that closed the passage. Alphonso burled his axe with sure aim, sinking it deep in the head of the Moor, and grasped the maiden as the passage closed. As the light fell on her features, he was amazed to behold Eleanor Urena. As she recovered from her swoon she murmured:</p>
               <p>"The Knight of Castile! how—how—came you here?"</p>
               <p>"I have taken the castle."</p>
               <p>"Oh, heavens be praised! But the Moor?"</p>
               <p>"Dead,—but oh, how came you here?"</p>
               <p>In a few words she related her tale. Alphonso now sought Pulgar. The Moors were all prisoners. They held a conference and decided that Alphonso should bear Eleanor across the mountains in Moorish guise and hasten to Cordova for reinforcements, and meanwhile to let the Moorish flag wave from the flag-staff, to keep the walls sentineled with men in the Moorish garb, and keep prisoners all stragglers who came to the gates, meaning to reinforce ere the Moors of Baza should know the castle was fallen.</p>
               <p>On the next morn Alphonso was conversing with Eleanor; he said, "Mine is a strange life; all trouble and mystery, with no happiness till I met with you. Since, I have cherished sweet hopes. Grant me your love. Let that bless my career and I will yet claim your hand with rank proud as your father's. Speak, tell me my fate."</p>
               <p>"My heart is yours, Alphonso. Now I can face all my father's wrath; for know you not he has sworn I shall wed the Marquis D'Leon."</p>
               <p>"Ha!—has <choice>
                     <sic>is</sic>
                     <corr>it</corr>
                  </choice> come to that?"</p>
               <p>But let us leave the lovers to their converse. On the next morn Alphonso and Eleanor arrived at Urena. The Count was rejoiced to meet his lost one again and amazed at her tale, but he was cold though polite to Alphonso. Eleanor had urged him to say naught of their love, and so bidding her a sad adieu, Alphonso hurried away for Cordova. When he was gone, Eleanor soon found her page Fernando, whom she deputed to follow her lover and become his esquire; joyfully Fernando proceeded on his mission, none knowing whither he went or missing him.</p>
               <p>Soon after, Alphonso with his new esquire left Cordova with a heavy garrison for Zali. As he neared the fortress, the Moorish-mountaineers on the surrounding crags taunted them; but what was the Moor's surprise to see the gates thrown open and the <choice>

               <p>We will now pass over a year, and visit the Spanish camp before Grenada. Meanwhile the Marquis D'Leon had renewed his suit with Eleanor; but in vain were the threats and entreaties of Urena. She vowed that she never would wed with D'Leon while the Knight of Castile lived. D'Leon and Urena were summoned to join the <choice>
                     <sic>seige</sic>
                     <corr>siege</corr>
                  </choice> of Grenada, and Eleanor and Maria were in the suite of Queen Isabella. Eleanor often heard from Alphonso by Fernando. Now she hoped to meet him, for Isabella was going to the camp. Alphonso had often met with Father Ambrose, who seemed much interested in his welfare.</p>
               <p>Thus matters stood one morning, when the Queen's cortege was ushered into the camp amid bursts of martial music. The roar of cannon echoed through the walls of the Alhambra, arousing the Moors who thronged the walls and gazed sadly on the scene, for now they knew there was no hope of the Christians departing.</p>
               <p>The tents of the Spanish camp were pitched in straight lines. In the centre stood the King's pavilion, on its right the Queen's, and adjoining hers, Del Pulgar's, who was now Chief Guardsman of the Queen.</p>
               <p>Among the maidens who remained in the Queen's pavilion, were Eleanor and Maria. Thus Alphonso soon found opportunity of quiet converse with Eleanor. Meantime Del <choice>
                     <sic>Pulga</sic>
                     <corr>Pulgar</corr>
                  </choice> made love to Maria D'Leon, who received his suit with favor, but bade him keep their love secret, as the Marquis D'Leon had pledged her hand to his boon companion, Francisco Varra. "Ha! is it so?" said Pulgar,—"when Grenada is fallen I will bear you away to my mountain home, despite D'Leon."</p>
               <p>One morn a daring Moor dashed through the Christian camp and burled his lance at the Queen's pavilion. Pulgar stepped from his tent in time to see the Infidel disappear. Resolved to repay the insolence, with Alphonso and a band of choice spirits, he attacked and forced a small postern gate, and riding rapidly through the streets, pinned an "Ave Maria" on the door of the Grand Mosque, with his dagger. By dint of hard fighting, his comrades held the gate till Pulgar cut his way back.</p>
               <p>When they started, Alphonso bade his page stay behind, but eager to witness the fray, Fernando followed on foot. Gliding through the<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC5586-00000005"/> gardens on the Vega; he nearly ran upon two men talking in a thicket. Listening a moment, he was surprised to find that they were the Marquis D'Leon and Pedrillo, plotting the assassination of his master. Pedrillo was to stab Alphonso while sleeping in his tent, with a poisoned dagger. On the next night Pulgar and Alphonso waited the assassin's coming, having placed an image stuffed with straw in Alphonso's bed. With midnight came Pedrillo; they saw him enter and pierce the image with his dagger. "Die assassin!" they cried. He bounded through the rent he had made, overturning a lamp into the straw. As he rushed forth, Alphonso's sword cleft his brain; they grasped his body and bore it to the space before D'Leon's tent, when they heard a cry of fire, and beheld their tent and the Queen's in flames. The wind was blowing, and the whole camp was soon in flames and uproar.</p>
               <p>With morn the whole army marched forth in battle array, and the Moors poured fort to meet them; but they met with repulse, and their last hope was gone, for Ferdinand soon began to build a city encampment, with streets and churches.</p>
               <p>Among the camp followers was a beautiful flower girl named Isadore. One day, D'Leon sought her, disguised as a servant, with a bouquet of roses, and bade her deliver it to the Knight of Castile from his lady love, saying his mistress bade him seek her and give her a piece of gold to deliver it. Isadore had a pet spaniel that soon after seized the bouquet in sportive play. She gave him a sharp reproof and proceeded to deliver her message. Alphonso received the fragrant flowers and placed them to his nostrils for a moment.</p>
               <p>When Isadore returned, she found her little spaniel in convulsions and evidently poisoned. She thought of the bouquet, and fearing mischief, hastened back to Pulgar's tent and found Alphonso suddenly taken ill; in a few words she told Pulgar her suspicions, and protested her innocence. Pulgar sent Fernando in haste to Father Ambrose, who was also skilled in medicine. He soon arrived; Alphonso was now alarmingly ill. The Priest watched his symptoms, then shook the bouquet over a goblet of water,—a light powder fell from the leaves, and the waters sparkled and foamed at its touch.</p>
               <p>"My son, your life is in danger. I have a powerful antidote. It will increase your agony, but it is all that will save."</p>
               <p>Alphonso drained the draught and was soon in convulsions. At length he became calm and weak. "Good Father," he murmured, "I am going—gone—I have a secret to reveal—ah,—Eleanor—farewell!—fare"—and sank back, breathless. Ambrose gazed wistfully on the white features and said, "'tis over—he is at peace—accompany me, Pulgar—we must converse of this matter."</p>
               <p>In the morning, Pulgar had the sad task of breaking the news to Eleanor. Tenderly he revealed the sad tidings. She remained calm, but the Knight wept as he saw the stern woe imprinted on her features. "Send Maria to me," she said, "I will follow him to the grave, and then woe is me."</p>
               <p>Alphonso was buried that afternoon. A vast concourse followed his body to its tomb in the new church of St. John. When the ceremony was over, Varra, who was present with D'Leon, said, "the fortunes favor you, D'Leon; do not forget your promise of Maria."</p>
               <p>"Wait, wait, till I get her back to the castle Leon."</p>
               <p>"'Tis well; but it seems strange Urena so opposed this Knight. He was no common rival."</p>
               <p>"Ha! think you so? I have my secret influences—I will win the proud beauty yet."</p>
               <p>On the next day Father Ambrose sauntered by D'Leon's quarters with Isadore. D'Leon was conversing with others. "Mark the cavalier in blue sash; is he the one that gave you the bouquet?"</p>
               <p>"Aye,—'tis the same voice."</p>
               <p>Grenada soon surrendered, and many Knights returned home. Pulgar parted with Maria, bidding her never fear Varra's suit; and if urged, to give seeming consent for a while. On the day after, Urena and D'Leon, with the maidens, returned to Urena. Everything passed quietly for a couple of weeks; then D'Leon addressed Eleanor—"Fair maiden, I come to once more, offer you my love."</p>
               <p>"Mock me not by talking of love."</p>
               <p>"I loved you for years, you have smiled on another. He is no more. Return now my love, and every act of mine shall be exerted for your happiness."</p>
               <p>"I have no faith in your words."</p>
               <p>"Ha! you revile me; now listen. I can hurl your father from his castle to the scaffold and cast you forth a beggar, if I will, yet I love you. But I will plunge to the infernal regions sooner than lose you. So ponder over the matter. Adieu."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
               <p>Eleanor remained alarmed and astonished. Ere long her father entered. "Daughter," said he, "do you still refuse to wed with D'Leon?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, spare me! I cannot love him."</p>
               <p>"Love! Perdition seize your whims! He loves you."</p>
               <p>"As the wolf loves the lamb."</p>
               <p>"Eleanor, I have borne too long with your obstinacy. I shall not die on the scaffold to serve your fancies. So choose between D'Leon and crime-stained beggary."</p>
               <p>"What mean you?"</p>
               <p>"D'Leon holds proofs of my political intrigues that will cost me my head. Wed with him, and our interests are one: and wed you shall."</p>
               <p>"Oh, heavens! Do with me as you will. Life matters little now. Why was I not spared this blow!"</p>
               <p>Great was Maria's agitation on the same day, when D'Leon bade her prepare to wed with Varra in a week, when he should marry Eleanor. She hastened to Eleanor, who summoned Fernando and bade him haste away and seek Del Pulgar.</p>
               <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC5586-00000006"/>
               <p>"Too late," said Fernando; "yonder he is galloping away."</p>
               <p>"What! yon minstrel, Pulgar! What has he been doing here?"</p>
               <p>"Playing minstrel and spy; so rest contented."</p>
               <p>The wedding morn at length came. Maria gave up all hope when Urena came to lead them to the altar. On the same morn, King Ferdinand, with a gallant troop, arrived at Urena. He was returning to Cordova, and stopped to join the festivities. Urena was pleased with his majesty's presence, and begged that the King's Chaplain might perform the ceremony. The castle chapel was crowded with retainers and knights. Before the altar was a platform for the bridal party.</p>
               <p>D'Leon, Varra, Eleanor, Maria, Urena and the King occupied the stage. The priests stood before the altar. One was old Father Ambrose; the other, a young priest with his cowl over his features, seemed indifferent to the scene. The parties arose: Maria trembling, agitated; but Eleanor pale, cold, stern as a statue of ice. Urena and D'Leon were sponsors for the brides. At the usual inquiry if any knew cause why the parties should not be united, Father Ambrose paused a moment. Vexed at the delay, Urena cried, "Go on!"</p>
               <p>To the amazement of all, the young priest exclaimed in a loud tone, "I object to the marriage of Maria D'Leon."</p>
               <p>A cry of joy burst from Maria's lips.</p>
               <p>"Go on!" shouted D'Leon, "I am answerable for her."</p>
               <p>"Unite them at your peril, holy father. I object."</p>
               <p>"Go on!" cried Urena; "you cannot prevent my daughter's wedding."</p>
               <p>"I object even to that."</p>
               <p>"Then answer with your life!"</p>
               <p>"Hold!" said the King, in a stern tone. "Peace, Urena: you must not trample on the Church. Hear him."</p>
               <p>Moodily Urena said, "Speak, then, thou meddler."</p>
               <p>The young priest threw off his robes, revealing a light form clad in rich costume, with the spurs and badges of rank. Ere he could speak, a strange cry broke from the lips of Eleanor, and a yell of horror from D'Leon. He regarded them a moment and said, "I have been known as the Knight of Castile."</p>
               <p>"'Tis a lie!" cried Urena. "The Knight of Castile is dead."</p>
               <p>"Ask him, is it a lie!"—pointing to D'Leon, who stood murmuring, "The grave!—the grave!—has given up its dead!"</p>
               <p>At the same time, a knight arose in the audience; 'twas Del Pulgar. "Comrades," said he, "'Tis the knight of Castile; alive as I have always known. Shall he be heard?" With a wild cheer the Knights crowded the aisles and surrounded the platform with drawn swords. The King looked on smiling. "Now," said he, "let there be silence."</p>
               <p>Alphonso,—the dead alive,—said, "Have patience while I relate a strange tale. I was the son of one of three brothers,—the eldest a noble whose wife died without any heir. My father was next and died young, leaving me and one sister in my uncle's care. My other uncle left one son, my junior. We were all reared under our uncle's care. I was ever protector of my young cousin, but he was churlish and quarrelsome. When we had attained manhood, some years ago, we followed the Marquis of Cadiz into the mountains of Malaga. You all know the massacre that befel us in the flight. I kept no weapons but my sword. Halting among the rocks I met my cousin bearing his axe. I said 'How shall we escape?' To my horror he replied, 'You have stood too long in my path; to perdition now with you,' and raised his axe. My sword was of no avail. He crushed my helmet and left me senseless, and, as he supposed, dead; attributing my loss to the Moor. The next morn I awoke a prisoner in a dungeon in Malaga. I soon recovered only to remain a slave, and was placed in the employ of a Moorish merchant, where I remained till Malaga fell by our arms. For the last year Del Pulgar was prisoner with me. When Malaga was taken I sought a vault my master had compelled me to construct, and bore away all his treasures, giving me wealth in abundance. I wished not to return to my home, choosing to keep my secret. I have since met my cousin, and received several murderous attacks from him, and at last came near the grave by poison. This worthy priest gave me an antidote that left me in a trance; and under the semblance of death I again passed from my cousin's path. I have now appeared to thwart forever his schemes and protect my sister."</p>
               <p>Urena, who had listened in great agitation, exclaimed, "Who—who then are you?"</p>
               <p>"Gonsalvo, Marquis D'Leon. The hand of Maria is at my disposal, and Julian D'Leon shall meet his <choice>
                     <sic>punisment</sic>
                     <corr>punishment</corr>
                  </choice>;" and he clasped his sister in his arms.</p>
               <p>Julian stood frozen with rage and horror while he was speaking. Only his eye gleamed with baffled anger as it turned on the Knights around him.</p>
               <p>Urena now seized Gonsalvo's hand, saying, "Welcome Marquis D'Leon! Pardon my former rudeness. The power that urged me now is gone."</p>
               <p>Turning to Julian he said, "Vile miscreant, you have held me too long in your toils. Now I defy you!"</p>
               <p>Julian replied, "You too shall fall;" and placing his hand in his bosom he drew out a packet and handed it to the King, saying, "Read, your Majesty; see what a traitor your host has been."</p>
               <p>The King read awhile, and turning to Urena said, "I knew all this long ago. I pardon you on one condition."</p>
               <p>"Speak," said Urena, sinking on his knee.</p>
               <p>"I am under many obligations to the Knight of Castile. He loves your daughter. Consent to their marriage."</p>
               <p>"Willingly; I always said she should wed the Marquis D'Leon."</p>
               <p>To the <choice>

                     <corr>astonishment</corr>
                  </choice> of all, Father Ambrose exclaimed, "I protest against their marriage."</p>
               <p>"What mean you?" said Alphonso.</p>
               <p>"I mean to object to this maiden's marrying the present real Marquis D'Leon."</p>
               <p>"And why can you object?"</p>
               <p>"Because he is too old, and she could not desire to wed with him." Throwing off his wig and robes, Father Ambrose stood forth a fresh looking man of some sixty years, and said, "I am Antonio, Marquis D'Leon."</p>
               <pb n="12" xml:id="VAC5586-00000007"/>
               <p>An exclamation of surprise burst from the spectators, and a cry of agony from Julian, who sank to the floor with a stream of blood flowing from his mouth; he had burst a blood vessel and fallen stricken with death.</p>
               <p>"Peace, let him lie," said the old Marquis, "and listen to my tale. Some years ago, at the time of my supposed decease, I was sitting at a late hour in an arbor in my garden when I heard steps approaching, and hastily concealed myself beneath the seat. My nephew Julian, and Pedrillo, a rascally servant of his, entered. What was my horror to hear them coolly plot my death, that Julian might fill my rank. Pedrillo was to poison my wine on the morrow. When they had left, I hardly knew how to avert my perils. All night I pondered; I had some knowledge of drugs and possessed some narcotics. With the aid of a trusty servant, I fulfilled my scheme. The next day I gathered all my treasures ready for flight; poured away my wine, and drank a potion that placed me in a trance resembling death for a time. I awoke in an open coffin in the family vault, with my servant by my side. Taking my treasures I hastened to Cordova, and sought admission to the church. I have since kept strict watch on this villain, who is now punished by his own deeds. When the Knight of Castile came to Cordova, I penetrated his disguise, and since watched over him. I have been received into the church, and now proclaim my nephew Gonsalvo; <choice>
                     <sic>Maquis</sic>
                     <corr>Marquis</corr>
                  </choice> D'Leon."</p>
               <p>Julian's spirit had flown to its retribution. "Bear him away," said Urena; and beside the corpse Francisco Varra crept away a sadder if not wiser man.</p>
               <p>Father Ambrose said, "we came to a wedding, I see naught to hinder one." Turning to Urena—"Eleanor shall marry forthwith if she will, but how shall we provide the other maiden; her lover seems flown. Ah, ha! Come hither Pulgar; I will provide you a bride."</p>
               <p>A murmur of applause arose as this well known warrior stepped on the stage and clasped Maria's hand.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile Eleanor stood gazing on Gonsalvo in wonder—she seemed restored to new life—and the roses again blushed on the cheeks. A more joyous party never approached the altar, though death and many a strange surprise had so late occurred.</p>
               <p>A tear rolled down Urena's cheek, as Father Ambrose pronounced the parties wedded. But he felt no grief; the pardon of his king, the happiness of his daughter, his scheme finally realized in the union of the families, all melted the stern man's heart, and the little liquid drop was the harbinger of a new life, and a better one. All now adjourned to the banquet hall.</p>
               <p>But little more needs be said. Fernando, the page, followed Columbus in his discovery of America, and pushed his fortunes in the new El Dorado, and returned to wed the little flower girl, Isadore.</p>
               <p>Urena lived with his children many years, and Del Pulgar, with his bride, oft visited his old comrade.</p>
               <p>Father Ambrose remained at the Court of Ferdinand, occasionally visiting his children.</p>
