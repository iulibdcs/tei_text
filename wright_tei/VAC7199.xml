                  Fifty-six by E. D. LONG, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United
                  States for the southern District of New York.]</edition>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE title of the following story, in a great measure explains itself: therefore but
               few words will be necessary by way of preface. "The fewer the better," I fancy I hear
               the reader exclaim, for I believe there is truth in the assertion, that few persons
               read a preface, and the few who do read it think it a bore; but it has, like many
               other disagreeable things, become a necessary evil.</p>
            <p>I shall therefore merely observe, that in tracing the career, not only of the hero of
               my story, but that of every character that figures therein, I have fixed my thoughts
               on a living model and have followed the original as closely as it has been possible
               for me to follow it, and at the same time weave from a mass of facts a continuous
               story, and develop a pre-arranged plot.</p>
            <p>My story is no less fact, because it has assumed the form of fiction. Readers
               now-a-days look into fiction for fact. Now-a-days, do I say! Ought I not rather to
               say, that fiction has always been employed to exemplify fact! The story-teller of
               ancient times always sought—and the present story-tellers<pb n="iv-v"
                  xml:id="VAC7199-00000003"/> Eastern climes still seek—to point to moral, while
               relating their fantastic and gorgeous fictions; and the novelist of the present day
               is but the story-teller of by-gone years, habited in a coat of modern cut, to suit
               the altered taste, and the progress of the times.</p>
            <p>Although I have not written an autobiography, I have pictured in the career of my
               hero the early history of his life; and in depicting every character in the book, I
               have portrayed the peculiar characteristics of each as faithfully as it has been in
               my power so to do.</p>
            <p>
               <emph>My</emph> story has a moral, too: but what it is I shall leave reader to
               discover. I shall not resort to the practice of the ancient painters, who wrote under
               their pictures, "This is a horse;" or, "This is a cow;" as the case might be, in
               order to prevent misconception. If the reader be unable to discern my moral, I
               confess that I shall have failed in my purpose; but i trust that such will not be the
               case, or at least I hope; should things turn our so unfortunately, he will find a
               moral in my story of his own making, which if it be a good one, will answer the
               purpose equally as well, and perhaps be more to his satisfaction.</p>
            <p>At all events, I have written with an honest purpose, and I trust have chose an
               acceptable theme. It has been said, that the history of any person's life, would, if
               truthfully written be of interest to the reader; but in my opinion, the mere every
               day adventure of may persons' lives, would be very humdr sort of reading. Still I
               believe, if the motive-springs could be disclosed, and the secret feelings be brought
               to light, which have urged to action at various important epochs of existence, the
               experience of the humblest and simplest would prove of the deepest and most
               engrossing interest. I am aware, that in striving to effect this, I have imposed upon
               myself a difficult task. I cannot hope that I have perfectly succeeded; yet, I trust,
               since I have adhered as closely as possible to truth, that I have not altogether
               failed in my endeavor, and I please myself with the fancy, that my story will at
               least strike some tuneful chord in the hears of my readers, many of whom I hope will
               be old acquaintances, though we may never have met each other face to face. And if
               through this story, I should again enjoy with these an hour's mental communion, even
               if I do not succeed in my more ambitious aim, I shall feel that I have not written
               altogether in vain.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>In which the hero of the story is introduced to the reader, not in the most
                     dignified manner, but after the fashion which most heroes make their earliest
                     appearance on this world's stage.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT was the 22nd day of February, 18—the guns were firing a salute from the
                  Battery, which was shortly afterwards returned from the broadside of a man-of-war
                  which lay at anchor in the stream, with the stars and stripes bravely flaunting in
                  the wind from her mizzengaff end, while a pop-gum sort of cross-fire was kept up
                  from the guns of several other vessels in the harbor. The streets were lively with
                  the gay uniforms of the various civic societies, and the air was filled with music
                  from the bands attached to each company that formed the brilliant procession. Out
                  of doors all was joyousness and gaiety in the city, and within doors, too, many
                  kept holiday in honor of the great day of national rejoicing: but to the
                  poverty-stricken, and sick and suffering, the sounds of revelry without afforded
                  no delight, and those who wept o'er sorrows all their own, heeded little the
                  anniversary of Washington's birthday.</p>
               <p>Stretched on a bed, in a small and scantily furnished, but sufficiently commodious
                  chamber on the second story of a tenement dwelling house, situated on one of the
                  streets leading out of Broadway in the direction of the Hudson River, lay a young
                  woman in a condition of paid and suffering, apparent<pb n="10-11"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000006"/> obtaining little relief from the rather over
                  assiduous attentions of a nurse who had evidently been endeavoring to brace her
                  nerves for some great coming occasion, by imbibing certain spirituous tonics, and
                  who had, like many other over zealous folks, rather over-done the thing.</p>
               <p>To her repeated inquiries of the sufferer, whether she lay comfortably in bed, the
                  young woman made no other reply than to beg to be left to rest quietly, and a look
                  of pain and supplication was all that the nurse received in return for her too
                  frequent re-arrangement of the pillows and bed clothes; but finding expostulations
                  and silent and imploring appeals equally fruitless, the young woman at length
                  resigned herself with all the patience she could to the tormenting assiduity of
                  her attendant. Only now and then when the door of the chamber was softly opened
                  and the pale, anxious face of a gentle man appeared, did she make sign or motion;
                  but on these occasions she turned her eyes towards the door and with a faint, wan
                  smile, sought to give the consolation he seemed to need. An hour passed away, and
                  the nurse wearied and vexed at the repeated appearance of the gentleman at the
                  door, at length asserted her prerogative, and telling him, in no very gentle tone
                  of voice, that the lady was doing well and was quite comfortable, and tat if the
                  poor dear became worse, she would let him know without giving him the trouble to
                  come to the door and make such a disturbance, (although, to tell the truth, the
                  disturbance consisted solely in his appearance in, for the time being, the nurse's
                  particular domain) the irate old lady closed the door in his face, and then with
                  an air of triumph turned the key in the lock, muttering to herself the while
                  various bitter anathemas against the impertinent curiosity of the male sex in
                  general, husbands as a class, and young husbands in particular, on such occasions
                  as these.</p>
               <p>The gentleman quietly submitted, as gentlemen on such occasions are wont to do,
                  however imperious they may be at other times, and in fact, the sentence of
                  banishment was not a very severe one, since he had but to remain in an adjoining
                  apartment out of which the door leading to the bedroom directly opened, and from
                  which retirement he could distinctly hear, if he strove to do so, all that passed
                  in the next room, and called for could be on the spot in a moment.</p>
               <p>He sat himself down before a writing desk in the room, on which lay a number of
                  narrow slips of paper partly written over, and taking a pen in his hand wrote
                  rapidly for some moments. Soon, however, the flow of his ideas seemed have met
                  with some obstruction. He ceased writing and sat apparently absorbed in thought;
                  but in reality listening anxiously to discover the occasion of the slightest
                  motion made in the adjoining room. He essayed to write again, but vainly and
                  throwing aside his pen in despair, he took from the floor one of a file of
                  newspapers, and glanced hastily up and down the columns. With a pair of scissors
                  he clipped out one or two paragraphs which attracted his attention, and laid the
                  carefully aside; but oven in this occupation on this particular day he appeared to
                  fail. Newspaper after newspaper was taken up and glanced over, and yet the
                  scissoring progressed very slowly until at last he gave it up in despair. He cast
                  the last newspaper aside, pushing away the crumpled heap which lay at his feet,
                  threw down the useless scissors beside the useless pen, and leaning his head on
                  his hand, sat in silence and seeming abstraction, from which state, however, he
                  was shortly aroused by the sound of a quick footstep on the stairs. He started up
                  and at the same moment his room door was opened, and a gentleman made his
                  appearance.</p>
               <p>"How do you do, Mr. Dalton?" said the new comer, and, without waiting for a reply,
                  he added, "how is Mr. Dalton getting on?"—at the same time walking to the door
                  which led into the bedroom, and tapping gently.</p>
               <p>His tapping was unheeded, and he repeated it somewhat louder.</p>
               <p>"It aint o'no use," now responded a querulous voice throu<pb n="12-13"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000007"/> the keyhole, "you can't come in, not if you knock
                  the skin off your knuckles, and you shan't—that's flat. Nobody shan't come in
                  until the doctor comes—and it's time he was here if he know'd how to 'tend to his
                  bis'ness."</p>
               <p>"Silence, you stupid woman!" replied the doctor. "It is I—Doctor Sinclair. Open
                  the door directly."</p>
               <p>The Key was turned, and amidst the muttered apologies of the grim duenna, thew
                  doctor entered.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dalton was about to follow, but with a malicious grin the old dame closed the
                  door in his face, and the poor gentleman returned crestfallen to his solitary
                  writing desk.</p>
               <p>In a few minutes Doctor Sinclair reappeared from the bedroom, and anticipating the
                  anxious inquiry Mr. Dalton was about to make, he said—</p>
               <p>"I am glad to inform you, Mr. Dalton, that your wife appears to be progressing
                  most favorably. I should like to wait here a short time, if you will allow me,
                  and, excuse me, but perhaps you had better retire into another apartment for the
                  present. You know in case of necessity—not that I apprehend there is the slightest
                  reason to anticipate any difficulty—you can be sent for immediately."</p>
               <p>Poor Mr. Dalton! first turned out of his own room by a crusty nurse, and then
                  politely requested to resign his private sitting room to the doctor. Independently
                  of his natural anxiety, he was placed in a quandary. He had, in fact, not other
                  apartment of his own to retire to, unless he took refuge in the kitchen, or in an
                  attic room occupied as a sleeping apartment by his only servant maid.</p>
               <p>A sudden thought struck him. He had been greatly comforted by the doctor's
                  cheerful tone of voice when speaking of his wife, and he said:—</p>
               <p>"Since you think there is no danger to be apprehended—no immediate——"</p>
               <p>"None at all, my dear sir," interrupted the doctor—"I do not perceived that there
                  is the least cause for anxiety; though," he added, smiling archly as he spoke,
                  "there is always anxiety on the part of the husband in such cases."</p>
               <p>"Well, then," continued Mr. Dalton, "I will run round to the <title>Trumpeter of
                     Freedom</title> office, and leave copy. The printers, I fear, will be waiting.
                  I should have been there two printers, I fear, will be waiting. I should have been
                  there two hours ago to read proof. It is but a few blocks distant from the next
                  street, you know; I shall be back again in an hour, and if before that time
                  anything should occur—if I should be wanted, why—why—of course——"</p>
               <p>"Of course you shall be sent for immediately," again interrupted the doctor. "But
                  give yourself no alarm. I have no doubt every thing will progress favorably, and I
                  trust that happy news will await you on your return."</p>
               <p>Mr. Dalton grasped the doctor's hand and shook it with a vehemence that astonished
                  that worthy gentleman. (It appeared as if he anticipated the happy news the doctor
                  had alluded to and was tendering his gratitude beforehand;) and then seizing a
                  roll of manuscript he left the room, turning about, however, before he closed the
                  door, and repeating:—</p>
               <p>"Of course, in case——"</p>
               <p>"In case your presence is required you shall be sent for immediately," interrupted
                  the doctor, stepping to the door, and closing it himself—and Mr. Dalton, in a
                  state of high nervous excitement descended to the street and hastened to the
                  newspaper office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dalton had been absent an hour, during which period the doctor had divided his
                  attention between the sitting room and the last salvo of artillery had been fired
                  from the Battery; the echoes of the pacific cannonade still resounded in the air,
                  and Mr. Dalton, who had, sorely against his will, been detained longer than he had
                  been expected, was still engaged in proof-reading at the newspaper office, and
                  mentally and most unpatriotically anathematizing the noise and confusion in the
                  street when a feeble cry might have been hard in th sitting room, proceeding fr<pb
                     n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7199-00000008"/> the bedroom from which he had been so
                  unceremoniously ejected, if any one had been in the sitting room to hear it. The
                  lady of the house had been sent for a quarter of an hour before, and had made her
                  appearance, accompanied by a lady lodger who chanced to be in conversation with
                  her in the parlor when the Messenger arrived; both these ladies, with the nurse
                  and the doctor, were now in the bedroom, and Mr. Dalton was the father of a fine
                  healthy male child.</p>
               <p>The grateful intelligence was made know to him by the servant girl, who had been
                  sent to his office by Dr. Sinclair immediately after the occurrence of the
                  auspicious event, and he hastened home as soon as he heard it.</p>
               <p>Loud and many were the congratulations poured into the delighted father's cars by
                  the ladies in attendance and gain he shook hands with the doctor, murmuring the
                  while various incoherent expression of gratitude, and commendations of the
                  doctor's skill. After a short time he was allowed to visit the sick chamber, and
                  to imprint upon the pale cheek of his young wife the joint husband and father's
                  first kiss, and to take and admiring look at the pledge of their mutual love; but
                  the doctor soon begged him to retire, as the lady needed rest—and he unwillingly
                  returned to the newspaper office, there to waste the hours till midnight, as was
                  his daily obligation; his weary labors only, on this special occasion, relieved by
                  two or three brief visits to his home, to satisfy himself that all was going on
                  well.</p>
               <p>Having thus introduced my hero to my readers in the person of the newly born babe,
                  I shall leave him for the present, while I, according to precedent established in
                  such cases, give some account of his parentage and trace back his ancestry as far
                  as is necessary to the proper development of my story.</p>
               <p>The infantile period of the most interesting hero's life, unless he chance to be
                  born King of Rome, or Algiers, or heir to some great estate, can possess nothing
                  of interest worth recording beyond the pale of the family circle—that circle, in
                  mo instances, narrowed to the fond father and mother alone therefore, I shall
                  allow some years to pass over the hero's head before I again introduce him in
                     <foreign xml:lang="LAT">propria personæ</foreign>to my readers.</p>
               <p>I may state, however, that the fact of his being born on the anniversary of the
                  birthday of the immortal Washington, afforded much food for gossip among the
                  sisterhood of the boarding house in which he drew his first breath. The landlady
                  of the house thought it decidedly a good luck in consequence; but she was in the
                  minority the other two lady boarders who, with the family of Mr. Dalton, comprised
                  the whole number of lodgers in Mrs. Hammond's select boarding house, thought
                  differently. They professed to believe that ill-fortune always befals the unhappy
                  infant who chances to be born on the 22d of February, on the ground that it is a
                  sort of presumption on the part of any child to come into the world on a day that
                  has been rendered sacred by the birth of the Father of his Country; and being both
                  elderly ladies, who had a great deal of experience in the world, and who had not,
                  in their own opinion, been lacking in observation, they brought several cases in
                  point to bear against the landlady, who, however, stoutly persisted in her own
                  opinion.</p>
               <p>This gossip, of course, was carried on in the parlor, over a glass of mulled wine
                  that was brewed in honor of the occasion by the landlady, and out of the hearing
                  of the young mother, who, while these speculations respecting the future prospects
                  of her first born were being made, was soundly sleeping to the droning music of
                  the nurse, who, wearied with anxious watching and her drowsiness increased by her
                  potations, was snoring in a rocking chair by the bedside.</p>
               <p>Whether the prognostications of the hopeful landlady, or those of her lady
                  boarders proved correct, will be learnt by the reader who traces the career of my
                  hero through the following pages.</p>

                  <p>Strangers in a Strange Land, without a European Reputation</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ABOUT thirty-five years ago, there arrived one day and emigrant ship at the port
                  of New York. At the present period the arrival of an emigrant ship is a matter of
                  every-day occurrence, and even at the distant period of which I write, it was not
                  an event of such rarity as to call forth any extraordinary curiosity, for the tide
                  of emigration from the Old World had many years before set Westward, and although
                  it had been temporarily checked by the war of 1812-14, the return of peace had
                  given to it an unwanted activity. Consequently, though there might have been a few
                  more curious lookers-on than are found in the event of a similar arrival now a
                  days, the matter was regarded with no very great interest by the citizens
                  generally.</p>
               <p>There was the customary hurry and bustle on the pier; the customary quarrelsome
                  vociferation among carters and porters and the customary endeavors to practice
                  knavish tricks upon the unwary passengers by emigrant runners, boarding house,
                  keepers, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">et id genus omne;</foreign> and by-and-by the
                  strangers were scattered in every direction hither and thither throughout the
                  city, seeking rest and refreshment after their long sea voyage; some were dreaming
                  hopeful dreams which were never destined to be realized; some were again mingling
                  in the flights of their sleeping fancy with the loved ones they had left behind
                  them, and a happy few were hatching plans to secure the favors fortune in their
                  newly adopted country, which were destined to succeed to a degree beyond even
                  their own sanguine expectations.</p>
               <p>The next morning the ship lay alongside the pier, deserted by all her late living
                  freight except the crew.</p>
               <p>Among the passengers that had arrived in the city of New York on board this
                  emigrant ship, were a young Englishman named Charles Dalton and his still more
                  youthful wife, whom he had wedded only six months before he sailed from
                  England.</p>
               <p>This young couple had engaged a steerage passage, from motives of necessary
                  economy; but it was evident from their appearance that they belonged to a more
                  cultivated class of society than usually composes the steerage passengers of an
                  emigrant vessel.</p>
               <p>On landing in New York they took lodgings in a comfortable but economical hotel,
                  and after chatting awhile before a cheerful fire about the friends they had left
                  at home, and over their future prospects in the United States, they retired to
                  rest.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dalton left England with a very scanty supply of ready money and a very large
                  stock of hope. In fact he felt assured of success, although he had scarcely given
                  a serious thought in regard to the method by which success was to be achieved; but
                  he firmly believed that before his slender funds were exhausted, he would be able,
                  in the young and energetic land of his adoption, to discover some stepping stone
                  by the aid of which he might secure a favorable position on the ladder of
                  fortune.</p>
               <p>If he had thought at all upon the subject of his future exertions it is probable
                  that he mainly depended upon his expectations of obtaining literary employment. He
                  had received a liberal education, and had been thought by his friends to possess
                  more than mediocre talent; but he had been taught no trade nor profession, and his
                  hopes of literary advancement in America were simply founded on the strength of
                  several literary compositions of his writing having found their way into the
                  newspapers of his own country.</p>
               <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7199-00000010"/>
               <p>Like many others, he had quitted the Old World impressed with the belief that the
                  services of a main of education would be eagerly sought after and liberally
                  remunerated in the New World, and that so far from finding himself under the
                  necessity of seeking employment, he would be requested to choose from a
                  multiplicity of offers the situation that best pleased his fancy, and like many
                  others he was doomed to find himself most wofully mistaken in his notions.</p>
               <p>He spent the first few weeks after his arrival at New York in looking about him;
                  in endeavoring to make himself familiar with the manners and customs of the
                  people, and in writing letters to his friends in England; but he was somewhat
                  disappointed when, at the expiration of this period, he found that he had had no
                  offer of employment.</p>
               <p>But a little reflection reassured him; for how was it possible, he thought, that
                  any body could make his acquaintance or become cognizant of his capabilities
                  unless he first introduced himself to them.</p>
               <p>By this time the small supply of money he had brought with him from England had
                  become alarmingly reduced, and he felt that it was really time that he was doing
                  something to replenish his purse—so, after due consultation with his wife, he
                  resolved to make application at some of the newspaper offices, and by this means
                  procure employment.</p>
               <p>It was Saturday afternoon when he made this determination, and on the following
                  Monday morning he sallied forth in high spirits to make the first application for
                  employment that he had ever found it necessary to make. As he left his room at the
                  hotel, he kissed his young wife, and playfully remarked that in future she would
                  have to make much of him when at home, for he intended to work hard when he once
                  commenced.</p>
               <p>Alas! poor Charles Dalton; he soon discovered, as many others have discovered
                  before and since, that he loftier a man's aspirations the lesser his prospects of
                  success. Before he returned to his hotel that night, his high blown hopes had
                  proved be mere empty bubbles, which had collapsed and wasted into thin air with
                  the shock of the first collision they met with.</p>
               <p>Newspaper office after newspaper office was visited in vain. Every where, with few
                  exceptions, he was courteously received and his proffers of service patiently
                  listened to, and then quietly and courteously declined.</p>
               <p>The newspapers of New York of that period did not employ the host of editors and
                  the large corps of reporters attached to every influential journal now, and he
                  discovered to his surprise and regret that every journal was fully supplied with
                  all the literary assistance it needed.</p>
               <p>Some few of the editors, however, to whom he applied questioned him as to his
                  ability, and his acquaintance with the routine of newspaper labor.</p>
               <p>"Ah! you are recently from London," said one gentleman, after having listened to
                  his story. "What journals have you been engaged upon there, and in what special
                  department with any," was the young man's reply.</p>
               <p>"Ah! I see. You have been engaged as an occasional reporter. Do you write short
                  hand?"</p>
               <p>Charles Dalton honestly confessed that he knew nothing of stenography, and in fact
                  had never reported a speech or a trial in his life.</p>
               <p>"You have been simply a literary man; perhaps a reviewer? We scarcely require the
                  services of such a gentleman here just now."</p>
               <p>The young man was fain to confess that he had been in no way connected with any
                  journal either as editor, reporter or occasional correspondent. "I have, to amuse
                  myself, sometimes written articles for the newspapers and magazines," he said,
                  "but I sent them to the editors anonymously, and never received or sought for
                  remuneration. Circumstances, unforeseen, have compelled me to look for support to
                  my own exertions<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7199-00000011"/> tions, and I resolved to
                  visit the United States in the hope and belief that a wider field was open here to
                  the educated and industrious than in England."</p>
               <p>The gentleman with whom he had been conversing was a kind-hearted man, and he
                  regarded the youth, for Charles Dalton was only twenty-two years of age, with
                  sympathy, as he replied:—</p>
               <p>"I fear, young gentleman, that you will find your hopes disappointed. As you truly
                  observe, there is a wide field open here to the energies of the educated and
                  industrious; but unless you have a practical acquaintance with some useful trade
                  or profession, education will avail you but little. If you were a printer, now—we
                  are in no particular need of hands—but I would give you a job until you could find
                  some employment better suited to your views. This is a large city and a vast
                  amount of business is daily transacted within its limits, yet there are always to
                  be found in the city more laborers in every department of industry than there is
                  work for them to do. The city is especially overstocked with persons like
                  yourself, accustomed to and fitted only for educated labor. The country is the
                  place where strangers should seek for employment; there they will find it in
                  abundance; but you are scarcely adapted for a country life, yet unless you possess
                  remarkable talent and have some extraordinary opportunity afforded you to bring it
                  into notice, you can scarcely hope for literary success, even after years of
                  struggling, and patient endurance of poverty and its attendant evils.</p>
               <p>"I should advise you—I speak plainly, because I wish to serve you—to lay aside
                  your literary tastes, and go into the fields. As a farmer your education will
                  still be of service, and common industry will always supply you with the
                  necessaries of life; with the aid of perseverance you cannot fail, in the course
                  of time, to become independent.</p>
               <p>"I tell you honestly young man were I as young as you and had my time to go over
                  again, I would shun the city as I wou a pest house and betake myself to the
                  fields, and become that most independent class of all men—an American farmer.</p>
               <p>"If, however, you feel unable to cast aside the habits of your past life, you may
                  perhaps succeed with the magazine publishers or the book sellers; but, take
                  notice, I give you little encouragement. You can, however, if you think proper,
                  write a short article that will afford some proof of your capabilities, and I will
                  then direct you to friend of mine, a magazine publisher; you can talk the matter
                  over with him, and perhaps you may come to some terms: but again I warn you—the
                  chance in your favor is but small."</p>
               <p>Charles Dalton thanked the friendly editor, and left the office. He turned to the
                  hotel depressed in spirits and weary with his travel through the streets, for he
                  had during the day called at every newspaper office in the city, and his imperfect
                  acquaintance with the localities has led him to traverse many a needless distance
                  and often to retrace his steps.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dalton mer her husband at the door of the sitting room they occupied in the
                  hotel. She had heard and recognized his footsteps in the passage, and full of hope
                  and confidence in her husband's talents, she had anticipated his joyful
                  return.</p>
               <p>The first glance that she cast at his face, however, satisfied her that he had met
                  with disappointment. She threw her arms round his neck and kissed him. He
                  affectionately returned the caress, and threw himself on the sofa without
                  speaking. His wife seated herself by his side.</p>
               <p>"You have been unsuccessful, dear Charles," she said. "I see disappointment in
                  your face. Is it not so?"</p>
               <p>"It is, Mary," he despondingly replied. "Nor do I perceive the faintest hope of
                  success. I have been grievously misled. Such as I have no business in this
                  country."</p>
               <p>"Do not be discouraged, Charles, with the ill-success of one day's endeavor," said
                  Mrs. Dalton. "Think no more about it to-night; perhaps to-morrow you may be more
                  successful."</p>
               <p>"I fear not, Mary, and yet something must be done, a<pb n="22-23"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000012"/> that speedily. You know as well as I, dear, that
                  our funds will not support us much longer."</p>
               <p>The subject was talked over earnestly during the evening. Charles knew that his
                  previous habits had utterly unfitted him for manual labor, and he shuddered at the
                  thought of the privations to which his young and delicately nurtured wife would be
                  subjected if he were compelled to remove with her into the country, and depend for
                  subsistence upon farm labor.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dalton's affection for her husband caused her to treat the matter lightly,
                  and in the hope of cheering him and restoring his spirits to their customary
                  buoyancy, she expressed her willingness to go at once to the country; but Charles
                  would not listen to her, and he finally resolved, notwithstanding the faint hopes
                  held out to him by the friendly editor, to try if he could not succeed in
                  obtaining an engagement with more publishers.</p>
               <p>He closely calculated his expenses for three weeks longer and thought that by
                  observing the strictest economy, he had sufficient money left to support himself
                  and his wife during that period, and satisfied of his he resolved at once to go to
                  work and write a series of short articles suitable for a magazine or perhaps for a
                  small book or nouvellette—and when he had completed his task to call again upon
                  the friendly editor and solicit his assistance in obtaining the promised
                  introduction to a publisher.</p>
               <p>He labored intensely, working early and late, and at the termination of the three
                  weeks he had completed a series of papers sufficient to fill a moderately sized
                  volume. He had some doubts as to their quality; but in his wife's partial opinion
                  they were the most delightful sketches she had ever read.</p>
               <p>She had assisted him from time to time, in copying now and then a blotted sheet
                  and in looking out passages in his books of reference, and in arranging the sheets
                  of manuscript and stitching them together, and at length, with a beating heart, he
                  again set forth to visit the editor.</p>
               <p>He was kindly received by that gentleman, and after words of explanation the young
                  man offered the editor his manuscript for inspection, begging him to read a few
                  pages here and there, and requesting his candid opinion regarding it.</p>
               <p>The editor carefully read a few pages in different parts of the stitched
                  manuscript, without speaking a word. At length returning it to the young man, he
                  said:</p>
               <p>"You have asked my candid opinion—and I will not flatter you; at the same time you
                  are aware that my opinion is simply that of one individual; others may differ
                  widely from me. Some of your articles appear to be very well written; but there
                  are marks of haste, and evidence, occasionally, to show that you have not been
                  accustomed to write for the press; but your style in scholar-like, and your ideas
                  are clearly expressed in simple and elegant language. There is much room for that
                  improvement which practice will bring. Altogether your specimens are at least
                  equal to the majority of those which appear in the magazines and reviews of the
                  day. I will give you a letter to the gentleman of whom I spoke the other day, he
                  perhaps may publish your manuscript for you, or advise you what to do with it, but
                  I cannot conscientiously give you much encouragement. How ever, there is nothing
                  like trying; a man that perseveres generally succeeds in the end, and I heartily
                  wish you success."</p>
               <p>The promised letter was written and handed to the young man, and wishing the
                  editor good day, he wended his doubtful way to the publisher's office.</p>
               <p>It was situated at a considerable distance from the newspaper office, and Charles
                  Dalton consequently had ample time to collect his thoughts and calm down the
                  nervous excitement which he felt creeping over him; but his efforts were in vain.
                  His nervousness increased as he neared the place where his hopes were to be
                  realized, or the labors of the past three weeks rendered worthless and himself and
                  his wife thrown upon the world to starve—for one dollar was all that remained in
                  his pocket. He rarely tasted spirits, but he felt so faint, so mu<pb n="24-25"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000013"/> in need of some stimulant, that for the first time
                  since he had been in New York he entered a public house, and called for a glass of
                  brandy, changing his last dollar to pay for it.</p>
               <p>He drank it hastily and pursued his way; at length he arrived at the office he was
                  in search of. It was a dreary looking place, occupying the first floor of a dingy
                  looking building, the lower portion of which was occupied by a dealer in hardware,
                  and the publisher's office was reached by ascending a dirty ladder like flight of
                  steps, on one side of the store. It was a very different place outside as well as
                  inside from the well-built, commodious, handsomely fitted up houses occupied by
                  the publishers of the present day; but it must be recollected that publishing was
                  carried on in a very different style thirty years ago, from what it is now.</p>
               <p>"Is Mr. Jenkins within?" asked Charles Dalton after he had entered the office, of
                  a young man attired in a threadbare suit of clothing, that had once been black but
                  had assumed a tawny reddish hue with age and dust.</p>
               <p>The young man looked from behind a heap of old books which he had taken down from
                  a shelf to arrange—and briefly replying in the affirmative, pointed towards a
                  stout red-faced elderly gentleman, wearing spectacles, who was busy in examining a
                  ledger, at a desk at the further end of the room.</p>
               <p>Charles Dalton walked up to the gentleman to whom he was directed.</p>
               <p>"Your name, sir, is Jenkins?" he said, as he drew near.</p>
               <p>"Yes sir, that is my name," was the reply, and the publisher looked at the young
                  man beneath his spectacles which he had pushed up on his forehead on being spoken
                  to, with an expression which seemed to ask the question, "and what is your
                  especial business with me?"</p>
               <p>"I have called," replied Charles, in reply to this mute interrogatory, "as the
                  instance of Mr. S—, of the New York—, I have brought a letter of introduction from
                  him,"—and the young man handed the letter to the publisher, who immediately opened
                  it and read the contents.</p>
               <p>"I have a very great respect for Mr. S——," said the publisher, after he had read
                  the letter, again pushing his spectacles up on his forehead and addressing the
                  young man. "He informs me that you wish to show me some manuscript—Have you it
                  with you?"</p>
               <p>"It is here sir," said Charles, handing the manuscript to the publisher.</p>
               <p>"A great deal of it; a vast amount of manuscript her, sir," continued the
                  publisher, turning the pages over, and glancing at the numbers at the head of each
                  sheet. "Three hundred and twenty-five folios. My good Sir—ah! excuse me; pray take
                  a seat. I observe you are standing—I was about to remark that if I were inclined
                  to publish it—mark me—if I found after due examination that it were suitable
                  matter—I don't say that I can publish it until I examine it—you understand that:
                  but if I were to do so, there is sufficient manuscript here to occupy all the
                  space I could spare in my magazine for the next twelve months."</p>
               <p>Charles trembled with nervous excitement as he replied:—</p>
               <p>"I know, sir, that there is more matter than space could be conveniently found for
                  in a magazine even in several months, but I thought—that is, I was led to hope
                  that you might feel inclined to publish it in book form:—that is if you found it
                  satisfactory after perusal."</p>
               <p>"In book form, young gentleman!" exclaimed the publisher, actually starting from
                  his seat with astonishment at the presumption of the supposition. "Why, Sir, allow
                  me to ask the question, 'Have you a European reputation?'</p>
               <p>"I am an Englishman by birth," replied Charles. "But unfortunately I have no
                  European reputation as a literary man. You will readily perceive, Sir, that I am
                  too young to have yet been able to acquire such a reputation, even had I made it
                  my ambition!"</p>
               <p>"Ah! of course—I see. But, really, young gentleman, you quite startled me with
                  your proposition. Why, Sir, it wou<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7199-00000014"/> be a
                  perfectly ruinous speculation on my part were I to attempt such a thing. Who would
                  read the work after it was published; or what comes more directly to the point,
                  who would buy it, Sir?"</p>
               <p>"I really cannot undertake to say," replied Charles, gaining courage from very
                  despair. "But I had no idea it was necessary to the sale of a book here, that the
                  author should enjoy a European reputation."</p>
               <p>"It is necessary, Sir, absolutely necessary; and even then I could not undertake
                  to pay a copyright for the work. You see the way we manage is, to reprint the
                  books after they have been published on the other side of the Atlantic and have
                  attracted notice there. Still, if, as I have observed, you <emph>had</emph> a
                  European reputation, I might be induced in consideration for my friend, Mr. S., to
                  give the manuscript more attention."</p>
               <p>"Surely, Sir," said Charles, "America is capable of supporting a literature of her
                  own? You have men of talent in all other professions in this country. Surely the
                  literary profession is not altogether ignored? Even in light literature, such as I
                  have ventured to try my humble skill upon. I think I have heard of Charles
                  Brockden Brown?</p>
               <p>"Brockden Brown? ah, yes—a tolerably clever writer he was; but his novels never
                  sold much here. Somehow or other he managed to gain attention abroad and he did
                  rather better, but he never did much, Sir, he never did much."</p>
               <p>"I have heard him highly spoken of," replied Charles, "though I happen never to
                  have seen any of his works."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, he has been pretty highly spoken of," returned the publisher, "but
                  still, Sir, his books don't sell like the books of the Minerva press class, Sir.
                  Our people's taste tuns that way just now, and publishers, you know, like other
                  people, must look to the main chances."</p>
               <p>"I have heard also," continued Charles, "of a humorous work entitled the
                  'Knickerbocker's History of New York,' which gained much credit for its author in
                  this, his own country, and which has been read with great delight in England."</p>
               <p>"Ah, yes, the Knickerbocker—a humorous thing, written by a young man—what
                     <emph>is</emph> his name, now? It slips my memory—ah, by one Washington lrving.
                  Knickerbocker's History of New York was well enough as a mere piece of humorous
                  writing; but it had but a brief existence, Sir. It has had its day, and I venture
                  to predict will not be heard of five years hence. The author is now in England and
                  he has published there another work called the Sketch Book; but he might as well
                  spare his pains. It is not at all probable he will ever achieve a European
                  reputation."</p>
               <p>"Then you positively cannot publish my manuscript?" said Charles, in a tone
                  rendered firm by desperation.</p>
               <p>"I really cannot entertain the thought; at least not as a book. Although since you
                  have been recommended to me by my good friend Mr. S., perhaps I might make use of
                  portions of it occasionally in my magazine."</p>
               <p>"A drowning man will catch at a straw," says the old adage Charles in his despair
                  caught at this suggestion. He could hope but for little remuneration for the short
                  articles which might occasionally appear in a magazine; but he eagerly asked on
                  what terms Mr. Jenkins would accept his shorter articles for the magazine.</p>
               <p>"Why," replied the publisher, "as to terms, I couldn't pay anything at present,
                  you perceive, till I see how your matter takes with the public. By and by, if it
                  suited, I might give a trifle, and perhaps increase the price as we become better
                  acquainted; but, to tell the truth, literary matter is a drug in the market—a mere
                  drug, Sir. There are so many young ladies of a literary turn of mind, Sir; sweet,
                  amiable, accomplished creatures, who write for my magazine to which they all
                  subscribe, and who consider themselves sufficiently repaid by seeing their
                  compositions in print, that I should really be doing very wrong to myself and my
                  family if I were to pay <emph>anything.</emph> If, however, you would like to read
                  one of you<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7199-00000015"/> articles in print, to oblige
                  my friend Mr. S., I will stretch a point, although my magazine matter for the next
                  month is nearly up, and insert one of your articles, leaving the choice of the
                  subject to you."</p>
               <p>"What do you offer for the article?" eagerly demanded the young man, flushed with
                  the dawning of renewed hope, faint through it was.</p>
               <p>"I shall be happy to send to your address a copy of any magazine," returned the
                  publisher. "Three or four copies, if you like, for distribution among your
                  friends."</p>
               <p>Without replying, Charles Dalton seized his manuscript, and bowing to the
                  publisher, proceeded to leave the office, when, just as he reached the head of the
                  stairs, Mr. Jenkins called to him:</p>
               <p>"Sir," said he, "I shall be glad to see you any time you are passing this way, and
                  if, at any future time you have any fresh proposals to make—why, perhaps we may
                  come to terms."</p>
               <p>"I shall call upon you again, sir, when I have achieved a European reputation,"
                  sarcastically replied the young man, as he closed the door.</p>
               <p>"A very singular young man that, very presuming, very," observed the publisher to
                  his clerk, "I wonder how S—— came to think of recommending him to me."</p>
               <p>Charles descended the creaking, dirty stairs rapidly; but when he gained the open
                  street he paused, as if uncertain which way to turn his steps. His last feeble
                  thread of hope was broken the labor of three long weeks had proved fruitless; he
                  saw nothing before him but hopeless penury. He thought of his wife, anxiously
                  awaiting his return, and almost breathed aloud the impious wish that crossed his
                  mind, that they both had perished in the ocean they had recently crossed, rather
                  than have lived to endure the misery which appeared to be in store for them.</p>
               <p>But soon better thoughts succeeded, and breathing a pray to God that He would not
                  utterly forsake them in their distress, he hastened back to his wife, to pour out
                  his sorrows into her ears, and to receive from her the consolation and support he
                  had often received in the midst of the troubles that had come upon them during the
                  four months that had closed, since he had led her to the altar, a happy bride.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>In which troubles thicken, and clouds grow darker, until Charles fortunately
                     becomes acquainted with a man of large mind and universal philanthropy.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>Had people but resolution enough while not cynically indifferent to the opinions
                  of others, to be less solicitous about what others may think of their own affairs,
                  of what a load of trouble might they at once relieve themselves!</p>
               <p>At last one half of the toil, the anxieties and the fatigues of life, is
                  occasioned by the struggle to cut a figure.</p>
               <p>Charles Dalton had never been accustomed to manual labor; until within a few
                  months he had never known the want of money; he had quitted England, because, he
                  could not endure the idea of descending in the social scale in his native land.
                  This was well enough, if he had been contented to forget what he had been, now
                  that he found himself in a new country, in which there were abundant opportunities
                  of gaining a livelihood, if not of carving out a fortune, although, perhaps, not
                  immediately such opportunities as were most desirable; but the phantom of pride
                  followed him across the ocean, and clung to his back still, with the tenacity of
                  the "Old man of the Sea," in Sinbad's wonderful story. Had he made up his mind to
                  work, without thinking it absolutely necessary that the work he engaged in must be
                  of his own choosing, he need not have been so many weeks in the city of New York,
                  and still have been unemployed. He had proof of this while he was despairingly
                  wending his weary way to his hotel; indeed he had not unfrequently quently met
                  with some one or other of his fellow passengers from England, men whom he
                  considered his inferiors, although he had been compelled for the time being to
                  associate with them on shipboard, but from whom he had held himself aloof as much
                  as possible, yet now these once despised mechanics and laborers, all seemed to be
                  doing better than he.</p>
               <p>On the present occasion, while walking moodily along Broadway, deeply absorbed in
                  harassing thought, he was hailed by a passer-by. He turned, and saw that the man
                  who had addressed him by name had occupied with his wife and family, the next
                  berth to his own on shipboard.</p>
               <p>He was an uneducated Irishman—a bricklayer's laborer, with whom Mr. Dalton had
                  scarcely exchanged a word during the voyage; but misery makes us eager for the
                  sympathies of our kind, regardless of the fictitious grades of civilized society,
                  and the kindly tone of the man's voice, and his apparent delight at meeting with a
                  fellow voyager, touched the heart of the disappointed young man, and he heartily
                  returned the Irishman's salutation.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Dolan!" said he, "I am glad to see you, you are looking well and hearty, I
                  hope you are doing well in New York?"</p>
               <p>"Doing well, is it?" returned the Irishman; "doing better than iver I expected,
                  Misther Dalton. Ah! Sir—this is a grate country for a poor man. No workin', for
                  tin pence a day, when ye can get it; but a dollar a day, an' plinty of work at
                  that, an' if it be o'paper, sure it sarves the purpose as well as silver."</p>
               <p>"Did you soon succeed in getting work, Dolan?" inquired Charles. "I got work,
                  sir," returned the Irishman, "afore I'd been three days in the city—in fact as
                  soon as I had time to look about me, after I'd got me say legs into shoregoin'
                  shape again, and I've had work iver since."</p>
               <p>"I'm glad to hear of it," replied Charles, "and I'm glad to see you looking so
                  well and happy."</p>
               <p>"And I'm sorry I can't return the compliment," continue<pb n="32-33"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000017"/> Dolan. "Troth! but you're lookin' like the shaddy
                  of what ye was on boord ship, Sir, and your face is thoughtful and throubled.
                  Ye'll excuse me for making bowld to say so. An' how's the good lady, Misther
                  Dalton, Sir?"</p>
               <p>"My wife is pretty well, Dolan," replied Charles, "but I have not been very well
                  lately, myself. How are your wife and children?"</p>
               <p>"Quite well and hearty, Sir, and Biddy she takes to the counthry amazing; as for
                  Pat, he's an American right off already, and little Katy, sure she's as fat as a
                  pig, the crather!"</p>
               <p>Charles shook hands with his humble fellow-voyager, and passed on. The temporary
                  excitement occasioned by the meeting soon subsided, and still more gloomy thoughts
                  took possession of his breast.</p>
               <p>"This man," he soliloquized, "uneducated, unused to the refinements of life,
                  satisfied if he can procure by his daily toil the simplest necessaries, can find
                  employment readily in this country, and obtain remuneration sufficient to enable
                  him to supply himself with all he needs, while with a thousand advantages that he
                  does not possess, I have nothing before me but my poor Mary! what will become of
                  her if things continue thus?</p>
               <p>He had gained the hotel, and passing in by the private entrance, he ascended to
                  the room occupied by his wife and himself.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dalton rope from the sofa on which she had been sitting, and welcomed him
                  home with a kiss. She did not speak, but there was anxious expectation in her
                  look, and he met and understood the interrogative glance of her eye.</p>
               <p>"Disappointed, as usual, my love." was his response, "I see no probability,
                  present or prospective, of obtaining employment, such as I am fitted for,"</p>
               <p>Oh, Charles, Charles! there was the rock upon which you split! No work that you
                  were fitted for! Then why not seek other work, and watch narrowly, but wait
                  patiently for the opportunity of engaging in more agreeable employment?"</p>
               <p>The young man had endeavored to speak in a cheerful tone of voice, but the keen,
                  anxious ear of his young wife was not to be deceived. She saw that his
                  cheerfulness was assumed and knew that it was assumed for her sake.</p>
               <p>"Do not despair, dear Charles," she replied, "surely if you have failed again
                  to-day it will not be always so. Success may attend your efforts to-morrow. We
                  shall not be permitted to starve in this favored land, of which we shall not be
                  permitted to starve in this favored land, of which we have heard so much and
                  entertained such pleased anticipations."</p>
               <p>Poor child! she was little more than a child in years although eight months a
                  wife. She smiled as she spoke and threw her arms around her husband's neck. The
                  light from the window shone full upon her fair young face, and as her husband
                  returned her embrace, he observed that she had been crying.</p>
               <p>"What has been the matter, Mary?" he asked. "your poor eyes are swollen with
                  weeping, darling."</p>
               <p>"Oh nothing," she replied. "I have been foolish, that's all. I am so lonesome here
                  when you are absent, Charles."</p>
               <p>"That is <emph>not</emph> all, Mary," said Charles, "something more than usual has
                  happened to give you annoyance; tell me what it is."</p>
               <p>"Promise not to be angry, then, and I will," returned Mrs. Dalton. "You
                     <emph>will</emph> promise?"</p>
               <p>"If possible I will not permit myself to be annoyed, my dear," he replied.</p>
               <p>"Because," continued his wife, "I have arranged everything so nicely, that I am
                  sure you will be pleased and we shall have means to support ourselves a few weeks
                  longer till <emph>you</emph> do get something to do, and then you know, you are so
                  clever that when once people know that you can do, you will have more to do than
                  you will be able to find time for; and our expenses will not be so heavy as they
                  are at this hotel—and—"</p>
               <p>"What <emph>is</emph> the matter, Mary?" impatiently demanded Charles,
                  contemplating his wife. "I cannot understand your meaning Has any one dared to
                  insult you?"</p>
               <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7199-00000018"/>
               <p>"It is simply this, Charles," she replied, "you know we made a little
                  miscalculation, and that manuscript took so long to write, and our bill was not
                  paid on Saturday night, so while you were absent to-day the landlord sent it in
                  and he demands immediate payment. Now, I see you are going to be angry, although
                  you promised me you would keep your temper. You know he knows nothing of us beyond
                  Captain Lyman's recommendation. His message was very civil; but the waiter said
                  his boss, so he termed his employer, had an offer from another person to engage
                  the room permanently, and unless we could give reference and engage to remain for
                  some definite period, he would be glad if we could vacate the apartment as soon as
                  convenient."</p>
               <p>"Cursed, impudent scoundrel!" muttered Charles, between his teeth.</p>
               <p>"Now, Charles, you said you wouldn't get angry and there is really no occasion for
                  you to do so," continued Mrs. Dalton. "You don't know how cleverly I have arranged
                  matters. All the money we brought with us is spent; but we have means of obtaining
                  more, that you are not aware of. I have never shown you the jewelry left me by my
                  aunt shortly before we left home. I kept its posession a secret when I found that
                  you had resolved upon going to America, in anticipation of some such occasion as
                  this when it would be of service. It is old fashioned, but really valuable,
                  Charles. I should not like to part with it altogether for poor aunt Mary's sake;
                  but I have heard there are places in which loans can be obtained on such trinkets,
                  and where they can be redeemed when better times come round to the owners—are
                  there not such places, Charles?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said the young man, moodily, "but your little ornaments, dear, must never
                  go there."</p>
               <p>"Do not say so, Charles; what are my ornaments to me, when you are in want of
                  money—indeed but for poor aunt's sake I should care nothing about them—you know I
                  never wear them. I should like to dispose of them temporarily that manner; then we
                  can pay the bill due to our landlord and get cheaper lodgings."</p>
               <p>"I'm sure there must be many places where we can get rooms quite sufficiently
                  comfortable at half the price we may here; and the trinkets ought to fetch a good
                  deal of money. There are a pair of ruby earrings, and a diamond ring, and
                  breastpin; so you see, dear Charles, that we are not so destitute as you
                  thought."</p>
               <p>It was quite a surprise to Mr. Dalton, this revelation of his wife's hidden wealth
                  of jewelry, and although his pride revolted at the idea of visiting the
                  pawnbroker's shop or the office of the money lender, poverty had so blunted the
                  edge of his sensibilities, that after some faint show of opposition, he promised
                  to try what he could effect in the way of raising money on these heir-looms on the
                  following day. Indeed the prospect of temporarily relieving himself from his
                  difficulties even by these humiliating means, rendered him comparatively cheerful.
                  He sent down to the office a message, informing the landlord, with the air of a
                  man of abundant means, that his bill should be paid on the following day, and that
                  he should leave the hotel at his earliest convenience and he and his wife sat up
                  till a late hour of the evening chatting together hopefully over many Utopian
                  schemes.</p>
               <p>The next day, fifty dollars was advanced at a loan office on the articles of
                  jewelry—the hotel bill was duly paid, and before night Mr. and Mrs. Dalton had
                  removed into cheap but comfortable private lodgings.</p>
               <p>But still weeks passed away, and nothing came of all Mr. Dalton's endeavors to
                  obtain employment. The hotel bill and other necessary expenses consequent upon
                  their removal, had considerably lessened the amount of the sum received from the
                  money lender—and at the expiration of other four weeks they found themselves again
                  utterly destitute. The daily and weekly newspapers had been searched through and
                  through with the hope that something available might be found in the
                     advertising<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7199-00000019"/> ing columns; but in vein,
                  and Charles began to give way to utter despair, when one morning as he was about
                  to go out to wander through the streets, he knew not where, he was startled by an
                  expression of joy from his wife, who was anxiously scanning the columns of the
                     <title>New York Mirror.</title>
               </p>
               <p>"What is the matter, Mary?" he asked. "Here is an advertisement which will exactly
                  suit you, Charles," was her reply—listen;</p>
               <p>"TO GENTLEMEN OF EDUCATION, ACCUSTOMED TO LITERARY LABOR.—Required immediately, a
                  gentleman to assist in the editorial department of a new daily paper. He must be
                  thoroughly conversant with European politics, and fully competent to undertake the
                  sole charge of the literary department of the journal, willing to devote his whole
                  time and attention to his duties. A knowledge of the French language is essential,
                  and one who understands and can read well Spanish, German and Italian, will be
                  preferred. The salary will be liberal, and as there can be no doubt of the success
                  of the paper, the situation may be considered a permanent one. Apply to A. B. at
                  the office of the <title>New York Mirror.</title>"</p>
               <p>"There, Charles," said Mrs. Dalton, when she had finished reading the
                  advertisement. "There is something that will perfectly suit you, you speak nearly
                  all the languages of the southern portion of the continent of Europe, and are
                  familiar with European politics. I knew that something would turn up, after
                  all."</p>
               <p>"But my dear," said Charles smiling at his young wife's enthusiasm; "I may not
                  obtain the situation, even if I apply for it; there may be fifty applicants
                  besides myself, and then I don't understand a word of the German language, and you
                  know that is specially mentioned."</p>
               <p>"No, Charles, French is essential," said Mrs. Dalton—reading again from the paper,
                  "one who speaks German and the other languages will be preferred"—and as to fifty
                  applicants, why, there can't be so many persons, qualified for the situation in
                  New York—at least," she added, "fifty qualified persons out of employment, you
                  know." "I am not so sure of that, my dear; there may not be fifty persons whose
                  qualifications are equal to the requirements of the advertiser; but I doubt not
                  there are that number of persons in the city fully as well qualified as
                  myself."</p>
               <p>"Do you think so, Charles?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my dear. Since I have been in New York, my ideas respecting my particular
                  abilities have become much modified."</p>
               <p>"But you will make application?" said Mrs. Dalton, apparently disappointed with
                  the tenor of her husband's remarks.</p>
               <p>"Undoubtedly, my dear. I will write to the office at once." And he sat down and
                  wrote a letter, honestly stating his actual qualifications for the duty required,
                  and then bidding his wife farewell for the day, left his lodgings to tread his
                  customary weary round, and as he passed the <title>Mirror</title> office, he left
                  the letter according to the directions.</p>
               <p>The day passed away with the usual result. Wearied and sick at heart with hope
                  deferred, Mr. Dalton returned at night having met with no success.</p>
               <p>"No answer has been sent to that letter I wrote to A. B. this morning, I suppose,
                  Mary?" he observed to his wife when he entered the room, on his return.</p>
               <p>"None yet, Charles," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"Of course, I knew there would be none. I might have known that I should meet with
                  disappointment when I wrote it."</p>
               <p>"But, Charles," interposed his wife, "there has not yet been time. An answer may
                  come to-morrow morning."</p>
               <p>"I don't expect any answer at all—I never did," was the rather sulky reply of the
                  young man, and no further allusion was made to the subject that night.</p>
               <p>The next morning, however, just as Mr. Dalton was preparing to go out, the
                  postman's knock was heard at the door. Mrs. Dalton went to the head of the stairs
                  and listened eagerly.</p>
               <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7199-00000020"/>
               <p>"A letter for Mr. Charles Dalton," said the man; and Mrs. Dalton almost flew down
                  stairs to receive it. In a few moments she had returned breathless to the room,
                  with the letter in her possession.</p>
               <p>"I knew it would be so. I knew there would be an answer, Charles," she said, as
                  she handed it to her husband. "Now, am I not a true prophet."</p>
               <p>Charles did not reply. He had opened the letter and was reading the contents. They
                  were brief, and ran thus:—</p>
               <p>"A. B. has received Mr. Dalton's letter and will be glad to see him at No.—Hudson
                  street, at eight o'clock this evening, and talk matters over. A. B. thinks it very
                  probable that Mr. Dalton and he will be able to come to satisfactory terms."</p>
               <p>"There, did'nt I say so? didn't I know it?" exclaimed Mrs. Dalton, perfectly
                  overjoyed, as she listened to the contents, read aloud by her husband, after he
                  had first silently perused them.</p>
               <p>"I have not got the situation yet, my dear," said Charles, smiling at his young
                  wife's earnestness, "and I have not now to learn that there are many
                  disappointments even when things appear most secure. You must not be too sanguine,
                  Mary. Perhaps nothing may come of this; however, I don't think I shall go out
                  to-day. I am weary of vainly walking the streets of this city. I will stay at home
                  with you, and in the evening will call according to the request contained in this
                  letter."</p>
               <p>It is singular how people will sometimes trouble themselves to discover that which
                  it is quite impossible for them ever to guess at with any possibility of success,
                  and how, at the same time, they will give themselves the trouble of guessing and
                  surmising, when it is in their power to discover the secret at once. A letter is
                  sometimes received and turned over and over, the seal examined, and the
                  handwriting subjected to a rigid criticism, in order to satisfy the recipient in
                  regard to the name of the writer and the object he had in writing, when he could
                  at once satisfy himself by breaking the seal and openion and reading the letter.
                  In the present instance it was utterly out of the power of Mr. or Mrs. Dalton to
                  form the least idea who was the person who shrouded himself under the mysterious
                  letters A. B., and it was equally impossible for them to guess the name or the
                  peculiar characteristics of a newspaper which had as yet no existence, and the
                  advent of which had not as yet been publicly announced. Yet still they did trouble
                  their heads the whole day to do both, until the futile endeavor became positively
                  annoying, and the hours till eight o'clock passed so slowly away that the day
                  seemed thrice as long as any ordinary day.</p>
               <p>Half past seven o'clock came, however, at last, and Mr. Dalton sallied forth to
                  the appointed rendezvous, leaving his wife in a state of great anxiety and himself
                  feeling no little nervous excitement, as he drew near the house.</p>
               <p>It was a dwelling-house of ordinary pretensions, and evidently occupied as a
                  boarding-house, for a dozen or more gentlemen were coming up stairs from the
                  tea-table as Mr. Dalton stood in the passage-way, after having been admitted by
                  the servant maid. It was a strange thing ask for Mr. A. B., but Mr. Dalton had no
                  clue to the real name of the gentleman he had called to see, and the servant,
                  unstable to understand who he meant, had recourse to the landlady.</p>
               <p>This lady it appeared, had received her instructions from the veritable A. B.
                  himself, for she requested Mr. Dalton to walk in to the parlor, and in a few
                  moments a stout, portly gentleman presented himself.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Dalton?" he said, addressing Charles.</p>
               <p>"That is my name, Sir," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"My name, sir, is Biggin—Amos Biggin," said the portly gentleman. "You have
                  called, Sir, in reply to a note I sent you this morning?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Dalton said that such was the case.</p>
               <p>"I am happy to make your acquaintance, Sir, and let me hope, that our
                  acquaintance, now formed for the first time,<pb n="40-41"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000021"/> be of long duration," said the gentleman; 'but we
                  must converse in private. The fact is, it is not generally known that I am about
                  to publish a new paper, Sir. It is an arduous task, Sir; one that requires a great
                  deal of consideration, and involves vast interests; but, Sir, humanity requires
                  it; the retro grading social and political condition of the country—which no
                  person holding sentiments of universal philanthropy can view without
                  dismay—demands it, Sir, and I am resolved to make the hazardous venture; aye, Sir,
                  and if necessary, not only to spend my whole time, and my whole talent, and the
                  whole amount of my pecuniary resources, but to sacrifice myself on the altar of
                  patriotism, sooner than relinquish the long cherished idea of starting in this
                  great city one honest, fearless, independant journal, which shall be the
                  mouth-piece of the people, and the exponent of the true principles of liberty,
                  patriotism, and philanthropy. But please to follow me up stairs to my own room,
                  Sir, where we can talk the matter over quietly and come to a mutual understand,
                  and I hope to satisfactory terms."</p>
               <p>Charles followed the portly gentleman to his room on the second floor, wondering
                  greatly why he had spoken so loudly and with such vehemence if he wished to keep
                  the matter a secret from the other members of the household, who could have hardly
                  helped hearing all he had said, and somewhat scandalized at the thought that in
                  the great city of New York, where there were several newspapers, there should be
                  such urgent necessity for <emph>one</emph> honest, fearless, independent journal,
                  that should be conducted under the guidance of truly liberal, patriotic, and
                  philanthropic principles: for of course, the inference to be drawn was, that among
                  those which existed, there were none possessing those sterling qualities.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>In which the principles that govern a true Philanthropist are explained, if the
                     reader chooses to accept the explanation.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MR. AMOS BIGGIN was a philanthropist, not, perhaps, according to the ordinary
                  acceptation of that much misunderstood noun-substantive, but a philanthropist in
                  the broadest sense. Mr. Amos Biggin had never been known to give away a cent to a
                  beggar, or to assist any individual in distress, whether the case was a deserving
                  one or not. Even had he been a rich man, which he was not, being himself often
                  very much in need of money for necessary purposes, he would not have expended a
                  shilling for the relief of individual distress. He held to the belief that it was
                  necessary to the well-being of society that there should be a proportionate amount
                  of misery and poverty in the world, and that to endeavor to ameliorate the
                  condition of the poor was to fly directly in the face of Providence. Providence,
                  he was used to say, had willed it so, and if Providence wished it otherwise,
                  Providence could change the face of things when it chose. Poverty was like salt,
                  very nauseous in itself, but very grateful when used to flavor other food. The
                  best cooked viands would be tasteless without that condiment, and in like manner,
                  the utmost wealth would fail to gratify its owner, if he were unable to contrast
                  his abundance with the necessities of others. But inasmuch as regarded general
                  panaceas for the universal benefit of the human race, Mr. Amos Biggin was a man of
                  large grasp of mind—a true philanthropist<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7199-00000022"/>
                  pist. Had he flourished twenty or thirty years later, he would have been just the
                  man to take a prominent position in the "vote yourself a farm" movement, or to
                  have originated the benevolent idea of the gift lotteries. The gold pen gift
                  society would have thrown him into ecstacies. The magnificent project of placing a
                  gold pen into the hands of every man, woman and child in the United States, at the
                  cost of one dollar each, and the chance of obtaining a gift, besides, ranging in
                  value from a magnificent brown stone dwelling house, with stabling, outhouses, and
                  all necessary conveniences, to a bundle of dried, sweet-scented herbs done up in
                  painted paper, would have set him wild with excitement. To have presided at the
                  head of such a society, and to have received the gold dollars, as he handed out
                  the gold pens, would have been to him the height of human felicity. "Ah!" he would
                  have thought to himself, as he dealt out the thin pieces of glittering metal, and
                  heard the rustling of the crisp bank paper—or the ring of the sonorous coin, that
                  he received in exchange, "ah! what glorious thoughts shall permeate throughout the
                  universe when every man, woman and child in the land shall with these gold pens
                  give tangible form to the secret aspirations of their souls! Hence forward no
                  "mute, inglorious Miltons shall rest unknown, and if Cromwells are still guiltless
                  of their country's blood, they shall freely spill their country's blood, they
                  shall freely spill their country's ink."—But unfortunately for Mr. Amos Biggin, he
                  lived thirty years ago, before these grand ideas were fully developed. still
                     <emph>he</emph> had tried <emph>his</emph> hand in various philanthropic
                  movements of a similar kind, though perhaps less lofty in their flight, as the
                  reader will in due time perceive.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Dalton," said Mr. Biggin, when the two gentlemen were seated in the private
                  apartment of the latter, which apartment, by the way, was by no means calculated
                  to impress the visitor very favorably in regard to the pecuniary prospects of the
                  owner,—for it was evident that either from motives of eccentricity or economy, Mr.
                  Biggin's apartment served him for bedroom, and parlor and all, and was not over
                  large at that. "Mr. Dalton, you have called upon me to obtain an engagement on the
                  new paper I propose to start?"</p>
               <p>Charles intimated that such was his object; indeed, the question was quire
                  unnecessary on the part of Mr. Biggin; and was merely put by way of opening the
                  subject.</p>
               <p>"You are aware of the qualifications that I deem necessary?" continued that
                  gentleman.</p>
               <p>Charles said that he was perfectly aware of the qualifications demanded in the
                  advertisement; but, he observed, he was afraid that if they were indispensable,
                  that further conversation would be needless, for he didn't understand German and
                  had but a slight knowledge of Spanish.</p>
               <p>"A mere trivial matter," said Mr. Biggin, carelessly, "you understand French?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, French and Italian."</p>
               <p>"Good—very good; and you have a tolerable acquaintance with European
                  affairs—political, social, and so forth?"</p>
               <p>Charles intimated that he was tolerably well read in European history, ancient and
                  modern, and that having travelled considerably on the continent, he thought he
                  might venture to stay that he was as well acquainted with European affairs
                  socially and politically, as most men who had not had occasion to make the subject
                  their special study.</p>
               <p>"Again—very god," observed Mr. Biggin. "And of course you are a ready and facile
                  writer?"</p>
               <p>Charles intimated again, that he had been accustomed to original composition from
                  his boyhood upwards, and had no doubt that by dint of a little practice he would
                  find no difficulty on that score.</p>
               <p>"Then if we can agree upon certain other points, such as salary and political
                  principles, and so forth, we may consider the matter settled," answered Mr.
                  Biggin; "but before I proceed further, let me explain to you my motive in starting
                  a new paper. You are aware, sir, that we are on the eve of a general
                  election?"</p>
               <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7199-00000023"/>
               <p>"Indeed," replied Charles. "I understood that the general election was to take
                  place in November next. This is January. And it is not until March of next year
                  that the new President, whoever he may be, will take his seat."</p>
               <p>"Exactly so. When I said we were on the eve of a general election, I meant that
                  the active members of the body politic, the men who guide the people in their
                  choice of a fitting candidate, or in other words, who feel the pulses of the
                  public, and have control of the secret strings which set the political machinery
                  in motion, are now actively but secretly bestirring themselves, and it has struck
                  me that an honest, independent, and incorruptible organ of public opinion is
                  especially needed at this critical period."</p>
               <p>"I should have thought, sir," said Charles, "seeing that each of the two great
                  parties has its especial advocate in this city, and I presume in every other city
                  in the Union, that there would be hardly room for a new newspaper, especially as
                  independently of the leading journals, there are others already in the arena of
                  politics, and ready, I imagine, when the occasion calls for it to take an active
                  part therein."</p>
               <p>"The very reason, sir, that a new paper should be started. Among all the journals
                  of this city there does not exist one truly honest, independent sheet. The writers
                  for the press, sir, are all actuated by the love of gain—sordid gain, either in
                  the shape of money or place. There is not one among them who would do what it is
                  especially the province and privilege of a journalist to do, be ready to sacrifice
                  himself, if need be, for the happiness, the prosperity, and the liberties of the
                  people. What political principles do you affect, Mr. Dalton?"</p>
               <p>"I am but recently arrived in this country, sir, as I informed you in the letter I
                  set to the <title>Mirror</title> office, and have, of course, attached myself as
                  yet to no political party."</p>
               <p>"Ah! I am glad to hear that; you will be all the more capable of writing
                  fearlessly and independently respecting all parties."</p>
               <p>"May I ask, sir," said Charles, "whether you belong to the Whig or Democratic
                  party?"</p>
               <p>"I belong, sir, to that party among my countrymen who are in favor of the widest
                  liberty, the most perfect independence, and the purest philanthropy. I shall hold
                  myself aloof from party while the preliminary arrangements are making for the
                  coming contest. I shall feel my way, sir, shrewdly and cautiously, giving a hit
                  here and a cut there, as I see occasion for it, and when the moment arrives for
                  prompt action, I shall throw my weight, and that of the independent party to whom
                  I at present look for support, in behalf of that party which appears most likely
                  to suit the requirements of the times."</p>
               <p>Mr. Bigging might as well have said in behalf of the party which would pay the
                  best, or that seemed most likely to step in and win, for, in spite of his
                  circumlocution and pompous declamation, Charles possessed sufficient sagacity to
                  perceive that the only object of this man in starting a newspaper was to take
                  advantage of the excitement anticipated during the forth-coming election, and to
                  make money by pandering to the prejudices of politicians of either side, who, in
                  the hope of sharing some of the spoils of office, would make use of any means
                  whatever that promised to bring them into notice. He, however, said nothing, and
                  Mr. Biggin resumed:—</p>
               <p>"My paper, our paper, I should say, for the journal will be started by a
                  subscription raised by a society of independent gentlemen, who have done me the
                  honor of selecting me for its editor, on the first day of February next. It will
                  be called <title>The Trumpeter of Freedom,</title> a noble name, indicative, I
                  trust of the generous purpose that will give it birth, and of the noble end its
                  projectors have in view. I feel satisfied that in you I shall find a willing and
                  able assistant. What salary shall you expect? I shall be able to offer but a very
                  moderate amount at first, and if the paper succeed, as I have no doubt it will,
                  the salary shall be raised accordingly."</p>
               <p>"I should wish to have my duties specially defined before I speak of salary," said
                  Charles.</p>
               <p>"Your duties, sir, will not be onerous, although they will<pb n="46-47"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000024"/> such as will keep you actively employed. I will
                  give the tone to all the political articles, and, as a general thing, will write
                  the leaders. you will collect the general news, attend to the library department,
                  write the puffs, the critiques, I mean, and do the foreign correspondence and
                  attend to everything else that may be necessary."</p>
               <p>"A pretty arduous task, take it altogether," said Charles; but there is one thing
                  I do not exactly comprehend? What do you allude to when you speak of
                     <emph>doing</emph> the foreign correspondence?"</p>
               <p>"Why, you see, Mr. Dalton," explained Mr. Biggin, "all the leading journals
                  throughout the country publish a foreign correspondent's letter, some of them
                  several, once a month or so, when the packet arrives with the European mails. Now,
                  our paper cannot afford to pay the high remuneration demanded by foreign
                  correspondents, so you will be expected to read the foreign papers when they
                  arrive, and dish up a letter on such occasions; do you take? That was my object in
                  advertising for a gentleman conversant with the languages of continental
                  Europe."</p>
               <p>"I understand you, sir," said Charles, smiling at what to him appeared the
                  absurdity of such a procedure. "To do all this will require a great deal of time
                  and attention, but I shall leave the salary to you, only trusting that it will be
                  as liberal as the paper can afford."</p>
               <p>"Humph!" ejaculated Mr. Biggin, after remaining silent for some moments. "I have
                  observed that we shall start poor, very poor; I should say that to commence
                  with—mind, I say, only to commence with six dollars a week, will be as much as we
                  can conscientiously afford."</p>
               <p>Charles had expected that Mr. Biggin would name at least twice that sum, and he
                  staggered at the offer that was made.</p>
               <p>"Six dollars a week, sir!" he exclaimed. "That will be quite inadequate to the
                  decent support of myself and my wife."</p>
               <p>"I do not think we can afford more," said Mr. Biggin; but seeing the hesitation of
                  the young man, and believing that he had found in him a man of education and
                  talent well suited to his purposes, he increased the munificent offer to seven
                  dollars.</p>
               <p>Charles still demurred, in the hope of obtaining a reasonable salary, although he
                  really would have accepted the first offer rather than have refused the situation.
                  Fortunately, however, Mr. Biggin was not aware of what was passing in his mind,
                  and finally the offer was raised to nine dollars per week, and the arrangement
                  settled.</p>
               <p>Charles Dalton returned home in high glee to inform his wife of his good fortune
                  and to receive her congratulations as the assistant editor of <title>The Trumpeter
                     of Freedom</title> that was on the following week to sound its notes of
                  defiance in the ears of the sordid trucklers to mammon and political sycophancy,
                  and to rejoice the hearts of the truly independent and liberty-loving citizens of
                  New-York.</p>
               <p>It was but a few weeks after he had commenced his engagement on <title>The
                     Trumpeter of Freedom</title> that my hero was ushered into the world.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>In which Mr Dalton's unhappy career is brought to a premature close.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MR. DALTON continued to labor at his multifarious duties in the office of the
                  Trumpeter of Freedom; working early and late, generally leaving home at ten in the
                  forenoon and not returning until long past midnight, when the last item was set up
                  by the compositors, the forms locked up and the paper dispatched to the press
                  room. His labors were indeed more multifarious than he had even anticipated, for
                  Mr. Biggin scarcely ever wrote a line for the paper. <emph>His</emph> duties were
                  chiefly confined to mingling with politicians of that class which was willing to
                  listen to the arguments of a man of his description, and whose only object in
                  becoming politicians at all, was to wriggle themselves into some petty official
                  position, and in occasionally taking a tour into the country, for the purpose of
                  "stump speaking" as it is technically termed. For this work he was specially
                  adapted, since he had for several years been in the practice of travelling through
                  the country in various vocations, pompously advocating the several schemes in
                  which he had engaged in the endeavor to push his fortune. He was of little
                  assistance to Mr. Dalton when he did condescend to write, for his acquaintance
                  with Lindlay Murray was very limited, and it involved more irksome labor to
                  correct his declamations and his defamatory leaders than it required to write an
                  original article.</p>
               <p>Months passed away, but the promised increase of salary was as far off as ever. In
                  fact the paper was only supported by temporary and not very honorable expedients,
                  and was never, in fact, in a position to render an increase of salary probably. At
                  length the month of November arrived: Mr. Biggin had a few months before decided
                  as to the party in whose favor he would throw the weight of his influence; but it
                  happened to be the weaker side, and when this was discovered it was too late to
                  retreat.</p>
               <p>The election came off, the candidates whose names graced the head of the leading
                  column of the Trumpeter of Freedom were defeated, and the following week that
                  tremendous organ of liberty and independence blew it last blast, and thenceforward
                  subsided into silence and oblivion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dalton was again thrown upon his resources, which were a little more available
                  than they had been at the commencement of the year. His connection with the press,
                  obscure as it was, had however, introduced him to some of the writers for the
                  leading journals of the city, and in a short time he procured an engagement on one
                  of these; but he had never been trained as a reported, his habits of life, not
                  withstanding the severe schooling he had had, were still against him, and he was
                  soon informed that his services were no longer needed. From that time, for the
                  space of two years, he struggled with innumerable difficulties, sometimes
                  obtaining temporary employment, and plunged with his family into the deepest
                  poverty; his health at length began to give way beneath the joint influences of
                  mental anxiety, disappointed hope, and privation, and he must soon have succumbed
                  beneath the weight of his difficulties, when a gleam of sunshine broke upon his
                  cloudy prospects, and decided him upon changing his views.</p>
               <p>One day a letter was received from London in which he was informed that two
                  hundred pounds, the remnant of an inheritance which once promised to make him the
                  possessor of thousands, awaited him, and that bills of exchange to that amount
                  were deposited in the hands of a banker in New York.</p>
               <p>He should now have returned to England, for he lacked to<pb n="50-51"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000026"/> energy necessary to success in a young country. But
                  his pride forbade him to return, a disappointed man, and to take up a position at
                  home inferior to that which he considered to be his birth-right and he took it
                  into his head that he would try his chances in the country and become a
                  farmer.</p>
               <p>He purchased a few acres of land in the State of Ohio, and removed thither with
                  his wife and child.</p>
               <p>It was a wild wooded tract of land, which he had purchased on the recommendation
                  of a speculator, without having even visited the property until the purchase money
                  had been paid. It required the remainder of his small stock of capital and some
                  credit besides, to purchase stock and agricultural implements, and in ill health
                  and without possessing the slightest qualification for his novel duties he
                  undertook to become a farmer.</p>
               <p>The result may be anticipated. In the course of a few years his little property
                  was mortgaged to its full value; in another year these mortgages were foreclosed.
                  Every thing passed away from him except a small strip of swamp land on the bank of
                  a river, which nobody would purchase, and poor Charles Dalton, reduced to utter
                  destitution, took his losses so much to heart, that he died in a few months of
                  grief, leaving his widow and child, but for the charity of some kind hearted
                  people who had taken pity on them, houseless and friendless in a strange land.</p>
               <p>Broken in spirits and in health, Mrs. Dalton's only desire, now that her husband
                  was removed from her, was to return with her child, now a fine boy of eight years
                  of age, to her friends in England.</p>
               <p>She wrote to her late husband's sister, Mrs. Ashley, who had married a dissenting
                  minister, stating her destitute and deplorable condition, and throwing herself
                  upon her sympathy although she knew that she too was struggling hard with
                  poverty.</p>
               <p>She had corresponded regularly with her relatives in England, but Mr. Dalton's
                  pride had prevented either him or his wife from making known to their relatives
                  their condition in America. All that had been written had breathed hope, and
                  hinted at future success, though hope had long ceased to exist in the hearts of
                  the writers.</p>

                     acquaintances.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE father of Charles Dalton, Gerald Dalton, Esq., of Dalton Hall, Cumberland, had
                  died suddenly from the effects of a fall from his horse, while hunting, only a few
                  months prior to the period at which this history commences.</p>
               <p>Up to the day of his death he was considered to be a man of large property. He was
                  the representative of an ancient family, whose members had for many generations
                  held a prominent position in the county, and Mr. Dalton had at the age of thirty
                  inherited from his father a handsome estate, giving him an unincumbered rent-roll
                  of three thousand pounds per annum. But the young man had deviated from the course
                  of his forefathers; he had been educated at Harrow and at Oxford, and had at these
                  places acquired habits of extravagance which required an income twice as large to
                  support. The consequence was, that he soon became embarrassed, and was compelled
                  to resort to ruinous measures to raise a larger income than his estate brought
                  him.</p>
               <p>The property was not entailed, and he had no difficulty in mortgaging it
                  piecemeal, and obtaining in this manner all the money his extravagancies required.
                  Nay, so obliging were his creditors, that they bound themselves to supply him with
                  the funds he needed without stint, and without letting the matter be known to any
                  one until after his death, when of course they would be enabled to foreclose the
                  mortgages and dismember the estate.</p>
               <p>It is not likely that Gerald Dalton when the first fell into the clutches of the
                  money-lenders thought of the ruin that was sure to follow.</p>
               <p>He was not an ill-meaning man, and, at first would have been shocked at the
                  thought of the ruin that he was bringing upon his family. But, the fact is, he was
                  a careless man, who never gave the matter a serious thought at all until it was
                  too late to hope to recover himself, and then, when years began to crowd upon him,
                  and he was driven to think, he consoled himself with the unctious proverb,
                  "sufficient for the day is the evil thereof," which proverb, by the way, the
                  grossly perverted, as many others are apt to do.</p>
               <p>His wife died a few years after his marriage, and the consequence of his criminal
                  weakness and thoughtlessness was, that his two children, his son Charles, with
                  whose unfortunate career the reader is already acquainted, and his daughter Ellen,
                  grew up in complete ignorance of the distracted condition of their father's
                  affairs.</p>
               <p>Educated in the expectation of enjoying affluence, and foolishly indulged in the
                  gratification of every extravagant whim of the moment, their distress may be
                  conceived, when in due time the will of their deceased father was read to them and
                  they discovered that. although the whole of the property was left to them, it was
                  so involved that the estate would be brought to the hammer for the benefit of the
                  creditors, and they were in reality paupers.</p>
               <p>Only a few weeks before Gerald Dalton's death, his son Charles married an amiable
                  and accomplished young lady to whom he had been attached from early boyhood; but
                  she was an orphan, and though of highly respectable parentage, dependent solely
                  upon a miserly uncle. Gerald Dalton, probably with a foreshadowing of the ruin
                  that awaited his sons's hopes, had strongly opposed the intimacy of his son
                  Charles and Mary Allen; indeed, he had positively refused to give his consent to
                  their union—and they had at last recourse to a clandestion<pb n="54-55"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000028"/> marriage. The uncle of Mary was cognizant of his
                  niece's marriage, and he had not opposed it. Nay, he rather urged it upon the
                  youthful couple, since it relieved him from the expense he incurred in the support
                  of his niece, and he felt gratified at the idea of her forming a union with the
                  son and heir of the reputed wealthy Squire Dalton, of Dalton Hall.</p>
               <p>Ellen Dalton was likewise aware of the step her brother had taken, but she had
                  encouraged him in so doing, and had kept his secret.</p>
               <p>In this, she had a fellow feeling, for she had been for several years betrothed to
                  a young man named Edward Ashley, who was pursuing his studies at a Dissenting
                  College near London, with the view of entering the ministry. Gerald Dalton, in all
                  likelihood, opposed this union on similar grounds to those which led to his
                  opposition to his son's choice, viz—the want of fortune on the part of the young
                  man. Still he never had the moral courage to state his reasons to his children,
                  and when his death occurred, Ellen was still unmarried, although she was three
                  years older than her brother Charles.</p>
               <p>When the ruinous condition of Gerald Dalton's affairs became known, Ellen wrote to
                  hr lover, explaining unreservedly her altered position and generously offering to
                  relieve him from his engagement.</p>

                              beggars, and though I am still and shall remain as devotedly attached

                              wedded another, and though I shall ever remain unmarried, for I can
                              never transfer my love to another, nor give my hand to one whom I
                              cannot love, I cannot expect you to blight your prospects by uniting
                              yourself with one who would be a clog to you hopes of advancement.
                              Dear Edward, you know how often we have conversed together upon the
                              subject of your poverty, and how we have fondly and hopefully looked
                              forward to the day which my poor father, would as I always believed he
                              would, at last—perceiving as he must have done—the firmness of my
                              attachment, give his consent to our union, and how we have laid out
                              our plans for the future, when the weath which I believed would one
                              day be mine, would be yours also.</p>
                           <p>"They were happy dreams, dear Edward, but they have fled forever. And
                              yet, I cannot, I dare not, reproach my poor father's memory.</p>
                           <p>"Charles and Mary are going to America. Mary, you know, came into
                              possession of a small sum of money left her by her father, for a
                              marriage portion. It is very little; but Charles hopes that with
                              proper economy, he can make it suffice until he can obtain literary
                              employment, (that is his object) in the United States. I am going with
                              them; and thought I <emph>should</emph> like to see you once more
                              before I leave England, perhaps it were better that we should not meet
                              again. The meeting would be too sorrowful, the parting too painful.
                              God bless you, dear Edward; though I shall be separated from you by
                              several leagues of ocean, my heart will still be with you, my prayers
                              daily offered up for you, my good wishes, alas! they are all I have to
                              bestow, ever exercised in your behalf. Shall I not have yours in

                           <p>I feel, I know, that we shall meet again at some future day—but no, I
                              will not raise hopes that must meet with disappointment, and whose

               <p>This letter was duly received by Edward Ashley, and the result was that he
                  immediately obtained leave of absence for<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7199-00000029"/>
                  his studies at Hackney College, and hurried down to Cumberland.</p>
               <p>Ellen and he held an interview, and in one month afterwards they were married.</p>
               <p>The young man returned with his wife to London, and shortly afterwards accepted a
                  call from an Independent Congregation in a certain town in the country of Kent
                  which I shall call Herrington, and became the pastor of Zion Chapel in that town
                  at a salary of sixty pounds a year.</p>
               <p>During the years that Charles Dalton had spent in America, Mrs. Ashley had brought
                  her husband four children, the youngest of whom were twins. He had also taken into
                  his house, out of pure charity, the little orphan daughter of a former brother
                  student, and still his paltry stipend had not been increased.</p>
               <p>His wife was now in ill health, and he had received a demand for the immediate and
                  prompt payment of certain bills, on the same day that he received the letter
                  acquainting him with the death of his unfortunate brother-in-law, and the
                  destitution of his sister-in-law and her child, who had been named—I have omitted
                  to mention this hitherto—after his grandfather, Gerald Dalton.</p>
               <p>It was Saturday evening, and he was sitting in his study busily engaged, or
                  seeming to be engaged, in the preparation of his sermon for the ensuing Sabbath
                  morning, when the postman knocked at the door.</p>
               <p>By his side, on the table at which he was writing, lay a pile of manuscript, lined
                  and interlined after a fashion that showed that whatever might have been the
                  worthy gentleman's usual facility of composition, he must have found great
                  difficulty on that particular evening in concentrating his ideas.</p>
               <p>He started when he heard the knock at the door, and listened attentively. He was
                  in the act of rising from his seat, when the study door was opened, and a blowzy
                  country girl, evidently a "maid-of-all-work," presented herself.</p>
               <p>"Who is that, Sarah?" he asked, without waiting for the girl to declare her
                  errand. "Is it Doctor Knight? How is your mistress now?"</p>
               <p>Without immediately replying to his questions, the girl handed him a letter
                  bearing the American postmark, and said:</p>
               <p>"The postman be a waiting, sit. He says the letter is two-and-four pence." Then,
                  as if just recollecting the questions her master had asked, she added:—</p>
               <p>"Dr. Knight comed in when I opened the door for the postman, and nurse says misses
                  aint no worse."</p>
               <p>"Dear me! bless me! a letter from America in Mary's handwriting, with a black
                  seal!" exclaimed Mr. Ashley. "What can have happened? Little Gerald dead, perhaps.
                  You say Doctor Knight has come, Sarah, and your mistress is no worse, eh?"</p>
               <p>"Please sir, the postman be waiting for the money. Two and four pence," repeated
                  the girl.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ashley took from a drawer the among demanded, and handed it to the servant,
                  breathing a sigh as he did so, however, as it regretting the expenditure of money
                  for such a purpose.</p>
               <p>He had laid the letter on the table without opening it.</p>
               <p>"My poor sermon," he muttered with a sigh, "it's useless for me to try any longer,
                  I cannot write to-night, I must preach an old sermon to-morrow morning, come what
                  will of it, although I shall be sure to be told of it by Deacon Milton. I can't
                  help it, my poor brains are wool-gathering to-night."</p>
               <p>So it seemed, for he appeared already to have forgotten that he had received the
                  letter.</p>
               <p>In another moment his glance fell upon it. He smiled at his abstraction, and again
                  took it in his hand, but the smile changed to a look of perplexity and dread as
                  his eye again encountered the ominous black seal.</p>
               <p>With a shaking hand, he opened the letter and commenced to read it, but he had
                  scarcely read the first half dozen lines before he stopped and gave utterance to
                  an exclamation of surprise and grief.</p>
               <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7199-00000030"/>
               <p>"God bless me! poor Mary!" he exclaimed. "How shocking! how very shocking!" Then
                  endeavoring to nerve himself to the task, he read the letter to the end, and
                  putting it aside, sat for some moments absorbed in deep and painful thought.</p>
               <p>His reveries were interrupted by the entrance of Doctor Knight.</p>
               <p>"Ah! how do you do this evening, Doctor?" he asked. "How have you left my
                  wife?"</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Ashley is by no means alarmingly ill; she is laboring under one of those
                  nervous attacks to which she has been for some time subject, but you must prevail
                  upon her to take more rest, or her disorder will become chronic. She must live
                  generously and take plenty of exercise. In a day or two she will get over the
                  present attack, and if she follows my advice, I think I can guarantee her from
                  future attacks of the disorder."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes; true, Doctor, true, Mrs. Ashley <emph>is</emph> too much confined to
                  the house; too much hurried; the twins are a sore burden to her, but she must take
                  more rest. I will see to it that she does," said Mr. Ashley, abstractedly.</p>
               <p>"I observe you are engaged to-night, Mr. Ashley, and I will not trespass further
                  upon your time," said the doctor, glancing at the paper and writing materials upon
                  the table. I wish you good evening, and do not alarm yourself about Mrs.
                  Ashley."</p>
               <p>The doctor took his leave, and Mr. Ashley again took up the letter and red it. He
                  then glanced at the old-fashioned clock which stood in one corner of the room. It
                  was past ten o'clock. He rose and put aside his manuscript, and drawing his chair
                  towards the fire, he sat down to muse over his present and future prospects, and
                  upon the unexpected additional responsibility that now devolved upon him.</p>
               <p>Unconsciously, yet as if by force of habit, his eye rested for a moment on a file
                  of papers upon the mantel-piece, consistion for the most part of unpaid accounts.
                  The sight of these changed for a time the current of his thoughts.</p>
               <p>"It is impossible," he soliloquized, "that things can go on thus much longer. I
                  have exhausted the patience of my creditors, and they will give me no longer time.
                  The two hundred pounds Ellen received from her late father's executors, I had
                  hoped to have set aside for some future object. It is her money, not mine, and has
                  remained untouched in the bank for years. Now, when I find it absolutely necessary
                  to withdraw it, there comes this additional claim upon me, for poor Mary and the
                  boy must be sent for, and it will cost at least fifty or sixty pounds to bring
                  them home. Then there will be another constant drain upon me, and to keep out of
                  debt will be impossible. Sixty pounds a year cannot be made to supply my family
                  even with the commonest necessaries, and my profession obliges me to make an
                     <emph>appearance</emph> of respectability at least. If I apply to the vestry
                  again for an increase of salary, I shall be refused; there are plenty to be found
                  who will take my place for that salary. If I tell them that I cannot support my
                  family without incurring debt, I shall be blamed severely; the very profession to
                  which I belong will be brought up to bear witness against my extravagance. My
                  extravagance!" and the poor man smiled bitterly as he repeated the word. "Then
                  Knight insists upon Ellen's taking more rest, and so she ought, and shall, but in
                  that case who is to see after the household affairs?"</p>
               <p>He took down the bill-file and turned over the accounts. "Seventy-five pounds
                  eight shillings and four pence halfpenny!" he said, after having summed up the
                  total. "Very little of Ellen's money will remain when these bills are paid and I
                  have sent Mary the money she requires. Then there is Knight's account, but
                     <emph>he</emph> will not be pressing."</p>
               <p>Wearied alike in mind and body, he fell asleep in his chair, and a whimsical fancy
                  flitted through his dreaming brain, suggested, perhaps, by the remarkable manner
                  in which his family<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7199-00000031"/> had increased within
                  the last year. His wife had during this period given birth to twins; he had
                  received into his family the little daughter of a deceased friend, and now his
                  brother's widow and child had claimed his protection; somehow or other in the
                  fanciful vagaries of sleep he associated these latter with the twins, and dreamed
                  that twins of all ages and both sexes were gamboling around him, and climbing his
                  knee and clinging to the back of his chair, while he and his wife were devising
                  schemes or their support, and for the support of fresh couplets that by some
                  unaccountable means still kept coming, but at last human ingenuity was at fault,
                  and he thought that he and they were left to perish with cold and hunger. He
                  shuddered at the thought of the fate that awaited them, and awoke to the discovery
                  that the candle and fire had both burned out, and that the latter portion of his
                  dream had been occasioned by a nightmare caused by the uneasy position into which
                  he had fallen in his chair, and by the cold air of the blustering March night
                  which had penetrated through the chink of the window and chilled him to the
                  bone.</p>
               <p>He rose and felt his way through the darkness to the bedroom, where his wife was
                  sleeping soundly, and he did not awaken her.</p>
               <p>Quietly as possible he undressed and got into bed, so wearied, that despite the
                  agitation of his mind and the thought of the many troubles the day had brought
                  him, he was soon asleep.</p>

               <p>R. ASHLEY awoke the next morning much refreshed, and with his mind less clouded
                  and oppressed with anxieties than when he retired to rest on the previous
                  night.</p>
               <p>His wife was already awake and much better in health than she had been for several
                  days. I was the Sabbath morning, and he strove for the time being to forget his
                  cares. He did not tell his wife that he had received the letter from Mrs. Dalton.
                  He feared that, in her present weak condition the too sudden and unexpected
                  intelligence of her brother's death might be productive of evil consequences and
                  he therefore resolved to break the news to her in the course of the evening, after
                  the labors of the day were over.</p>
               <p>That Sabbath morning Mr. Ashley preached a sermon he had preached a year before.
                  It was, in his opinion, one of his best, and certainly a better one than he could
                  have written under the depressing influences of the past week. But as he had the
                  wealthiest member of the congregation, and several other members, recollected to
                  have heard the same sermon preached before. They took umbrage at this, and a
                  committee was appointed to wait upon the minister during the ensuing week and
                  remonstrate with him upon the enormity of which he had been guilty.</p>
               <p>The afternoon service passed off satisfactorily and in to<pb n="62-63"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000032"/> evening, Mrs. Ashley still improving in health, her
                  husband thought it advisable to acquaint her with the said news he had heard from
                  abroad.</p>
               <p>He thought it a good opportunity after the children had been put to bed to
                  introduce the subject by some remarks in relation to his family and after he had
                  bestowed a paternal kiss upon the twins who were carried to bed by the
                  servant-maid, he observed carelessly:—</p>
               <p>"We have a large family already growing up around us, Ellen; a couple more would
                  fill up the circle of our small table."</p>
               <p>Now, Mrs. Ashley was a kind-hearted, amiable woman, as the reader already knows;
                  she had perhaps fewer weaknesses than usually fall to the lot of humanity. She was
                  as kind to the little orphan her husband had adopted as to her own children, and
                  had she possessed the means would have permitted no one to suffer distress that it
                  lay in her power to relieve. But she had one sore point; it was the twins. On the
                  occasion of their birth, a year before, Mr. Ashley had incautiously made some
                  regretful allusion, half jocularly, and half earnestly, to the rapid increase of
                  his responsibilities, which allusion had been carried to the ears of his wife by a
                  tittle-tattling nurse, and the lady had never entirely forgotten or forgiven it.
                  It had rankled in her bosom ever since, and whenever any allusion was made to her
                  family increase she resented it. On the present occasion, Mr. Ashley having but
                  that moment caressed the twins, the allusion to an increase of two to the family
                  circle was particularly <foreign xml:lang="LAT">mal apropos.</foreign> What else
                  could he allude to but twins?</p>
               <p>"It is really too bad of you, Edward," she replied, "to be continually harping
                  upon those dear babies. You seem to regret the occurrence of an event which most
                  fathers would, and all ought to be proud of I believe you actually begin to regret
                  the poor children with dislike."</p>
               <p>"My dear Ellen," replied Mr. Ashley, observing that his wife was greatly annoyed
                  at his remark, "You misunderstand me entirely. I was not thinking at the moment I
                  spoke of our own dear children. God knows that I should care not how many olive
                  branches were gathered around my table, if I had the means of supporting them. No,
                  Ellen, I repeat, I was not then thinking of our own children, but of the half
                  orphan child of one nearly related to us, who, poor thing, has a claim upon us,
                  which, poor as we are, we cannot deny."</p>
               <p>"Of whom are you speaking, Edward?" said Mrs. Ashley "surely no relative of ours
                  has died lately.</p>
               <p>"Death has laid his hand upon one near and dear to us both, Ellen," solemnly
                  replied Mr. Ashley. "I have received a letter from America which contains some sad
                  news."</p>
               <p>"Nothing has happened to my brother or Mary?" said Mrs. Ashley in a voice of
                  alarm.</p>
               <p>"Mary writes that she is in low spirits but does not say she is in bad health,"
                  replied Mr. Ashely</p>
               <p>"The child—"</p>
               <p>"Is well," interrupted Mr. Ashely.</p>
               <p>He said no more, but the saddened tone of his voice satisfied his wife of that
                  which her fears had not permitted her to ask.</p>
               <p>"I know all, Edward," she said, "my brother Charles is dead."</p>
               <p>She turned pale and Mr. Ashley thought she was about to faint; but she recovered
                  herself and in a voice trembling with agitation begged her husband to tell her
                  all—she was able to listen to him.</p>
               <p>Without speaking he placed the letter in her hands, and unfalteringly she read it
                  through to the end; then folding it and returning it to her husband, she
                  said:—</p>
               <p>"I understand your allusion now, Edward. Mary and the child must come to us." She
                  was about to add something further, but her fortitude failed her, and murmuring
                  "Charles, my poor, dear brother Charles," she burst into tears.</p>
               <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7199-00000033"/>
               <p>Mr. Ashley permitted her to weep freely without making any effort to repress her
                  emotions. He knew that it was better that her distressed feelings should find full
                  vent in tears, and in the course of a few minutes she dried her eyes, and again
                  addressing herself to her husband she said—</p>
               <p>"This is sad news, Edward."</p>
               <p>"Sad news, indeed, Ellen."</p>
               <p>"And poor Mary is in poverty in a strange land."</p>
               <p>"In poverty, but let us hope not in utter destitution," returned her husband.
                  "Mary writes, as you perceive, in the most touching terms of the kindness and
                  sympathy she has met with, especially from the American ladies who knew her
                  husband, and who have been her neighbors for a long time. She says that they were
                  indefatigable in their kindness to poor Charles during his last sickness."</p>
               <p>"God bless them, for their kindness to poor Charles," said Mrs. Ashley, again
                  giving way to tears.</p>
               <p>"Calm yourself, Ellen," said Mr. Ashley, "endeavor to compose yourself, my dear.
                  We have both decided that Mary and the boy must come to us, for I knew what your
                  decision would be before I told you the sad news."</p>
               <p>"You have not written to her?" sobbed his wife.</p>
               <p>"No, Ellen. I only received the letter yesterday and I do not yet know when the
                  next mail will be made up for America, besides it is necessary that we should
                  arrange matters together before I write. You are aware from the letter that Mary
                  has no funds to enable her to return."</p>
               <p>"We must send her money," impulsively replied Mr. Ashley.</p>
               <p>Her husband smiled sadly, and she understood the meaning of the smile.</p>
               <p>"You would infer that we have no money ourselves, Edward, but there are the two
                  hundred pounds that were paid over to me out of the remnant of my poor father's
                  estate. We can send her that. That will be sufficient."</p>
               <p>"Less than that amount will be sufficient, I hope," returned Mrs. Ashley. "It
                  grieves me sorely, Ellen, to touch that money which I had hoped to set apart for
                  you and the children in case anything should happen to me, but you know, for we
                  spoke of the matter the other day, that necessity will compel us to withdraw a
                  portion of the money for the payment of debts unavoidably incurred."</p>
               <p>"I know, Edward. How much will be required for that purpose?"</p>
               <p>"One hundred pounds will be more than sufficient for the present," replied Mr.
                  Ashley, but he sighed inwardly as he spoke, for he knew not what would be
                  necessary in the future which loomed so darkly.</p>
               <p>"And then there will be one hundred still to send to Mary."</p>
               <p>"Mary writes that she merely needs money enough to pay the price of her passage
                  and that of her child to England," said Mr. Ashley. "She says that the sale of her
                  effects will pay her outstanding debts and provide her with sufficient funds to
                  reach New York. I think sixty pounds will be sufficient to provide her a
                  comfortable passage home in one of the packet ships; less might do, but of course
                  she must take passage in a good ship."</p>
               <p>"Of course, Edward," returned his wife.</p>
               <p>"Then we will consider that matter settled. To-morrow I will make the necessary
                  inquiries and write to Mary, transmitting the money as soon as possible. You had
                  better write too, Ellen."</p>
               <p>"I will," replied Mrs. Ashley.</p>
               <p>"And now, my dear, you had better retire to rest and endeavor, if you can, to
                  banish this sad subject from your mind."</p>
               <p>In a few minutes Mrs. Ashley left the parlor and sought her chamber, leaving her
                  husband seated by the fire deeply absorbed in thought.</p>
               <p>Neither of them had said a word in relation to the destitution<pb n="66-67"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000034"/> condition in which Charles Dalton had left his wife
                  and child. As I have said, they had been led to believe that he was doing well in
                  his adopted country, and the news of his poverty was quite unexpected to them.
                  Both Mr. Ashley and his wife were aware that America offered opportunities to the
                  energetic and industrious that were not easily to be found in England, provided
                  that their energy and industry were rightly directed. They were aware, too, of the
                  peculiar failings of Charles Dalton's character, and perhaps both suspected the
                  cause of his want of success, but at present they were silent on the subject.
                  Respect for a beloved brother now no more, kept their tongues sealed from any
                  expression of their thoughts.</p>
               <p>During the week Mr. Ashley wrote to the banker who had the little legacy of his
                  wife's in his possession, and the money was transmitted to him. His pressing debts
                  were paid-with, and inquiry having been made as to the cost of a passage from
                  America to England, and sixty pounds found to be more than would be necessary, Mr.
                  Ashley and his wife both wrote to Mary Dalton, and bills of exchange on New-York
                  for that amount were transmitted for her use.</p>
               <p>The poor minister and his wife now found themselves once more free from pressing
                  debt; Doctor Knight still visited Mrs. Ashley, and there was a bill of long
                  standing due to him, but they knew that he would not press for its settlement.
                  Indeed, he was aware of the impoverished condition of Mr. Ashley's affairs, and in
                  an off-hand yet delicate manner had hinted that he was in no hurry for his money.
                  Yet of the two hundred pounds, little more than forty now remained, and to the
                  weight of care which hung like a millstone upon the shoulders of the poor pastor
                  was about to be added the support of his sister-in-law and his nephew. Indeed, he
                  had need for the exercise of all his faith and trust in Providence!</p>
               <p>Fresh trials also beset him during this momentous week. He was taken sorely to
                  task for his remissness, as they termed it, by the deacons of his church. It was
                  in vain that pleaded in excuse his many cares and troubles, the illness of his
                  wife, and the news that he had received of his brother-in-law's death. His
                  pecuniary troubles he did not attempt to plead in extenuation, for he knew that to
                  imply that he was not sufficiently repaid for his clerical labors would only lead
                  to recrimination on the part of the zealous devotees of Zion Chapel. He was told
                  that a minister of the Gospel should detach his mind from earthly cares, which
                  were only sent in order to purify his soul and render him better fitted for the
                  duties of his sacred calling. The Pharisees! It would have been well had they been
                  burthened with the load of care they treated so lightly when borne by another, and
                  compelled to support in respectability a wife and family on sixty pounds a year;
                  but then they were not ministers of the Gospel, and therefore might, in such a
                  case, murmur as much as they pleased.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ashley was in fact bluntly informed that unless he pleased the elders of his
                  congregation better, they would be compelled to dispense with his services; there
                  were others who would willingly undertake his duties for the salary that he
                  received.</p>
               <p>Had the minister been a single man, or had he possessed any other means of
                  support, he would have cared little for these threats, and would have thrown up is
                  charge in disgust, but he was crushed and humbled, borne down to the earth with
                  trouble, and he dared not retort. Let no one blame him for this submission who has
                  not himself felt the crushing burden of dependence.</p>
               <p>One only friend he had save Doctor Knight, and that friend was the vicar of the
                  parish. He was not a rich man, but his income was sufficient for his necessities.
                  He was a man of education, and was Mr. Ashley, and he deeply sympathized with his
                  brother preacher, though he belonged to a different persuasion. But they differed
                  little in sentiment. Both believed that it mattered little as to the peculiar form
                  of worship, of the spirit of devotion were right, and Mr. Ashley,<pb n="68-69"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000035"/> when he first entertained the idea of entering the
                  ministry, had inclined to the doctrines of the Established Church. It was the want
                  of an Oxford or Cambridge degree which alone had restrained him and obliged him to
                  turn his attention to the Independent persuasion.</p>

                  <p>Gerald Dalton falls in with a fellow-countryman in the stage, on his journey to
                     Kent, and what comes to the meeting.—Mrs. Dalton is welcomed home by her
                     sister.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT is unnecessary to comment upon the feelings of Mrs. Dalton when she received
                  the sympathizing letters from her brother and sister, and when knowing them to be
                  poor, and burdened with many cares, she found them respond so generously to her
                  appeal.</p>
               <p>A passage had been pre-engaged for her in England by her brother-in-law, and it
                  was necessary that she should hasten immediately to New-York, for the vessel in
                  which her passage was taken had but to discharge her cargo and take in another
                  already waiting for her, and then to sail directly for Liverpool again.</p>
               <p>Yet when the time came that she was to quit, perhaps forever, the land which had
                  so long been her home, which notwithstanding the trouble she had experienced since
                  she had set foot upon its soil, she had learned to love only second to the land of
                  her birth, and which, had her husband lived and prospered, she might have learned,
                  in time, to love and cherish as fondly as her native soil, she found that she
                  could not bd it farewell without a pang of regret. Nay, more, she then felt that
                  its soil was hallowed to her memory forever, for beneath it lay the remains of her
                  deceased and beloved, though unfortunate husband—doubly beloved, in consequence of
                  his misfortunes. The thought of returning to her friends had cheer<pb n="70-71"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000036"/> her sad, solitary heart, during the earliest days
                  of her young widowhood, yet now, she felt that if she had the means of living in
                  her adopted country, in the land in which was her husband's grave, and in which
                  her child was born, she would still have remained near the spot where she had met
                  the last expiring look of love from the partner of her joys and sorrows, had
                  received his dying embrace, and had seen his body consigned to the grave. The kind
                  friends, too, who had sympathized with and comforted hr in her afflictions, she
                  could not leave them without regret and a longing desire to see them again. But
                  fortunately for her, perhaps, there was little time to spend in brooding over the
                  past or thinking of the future. The ship was waiting her in New-York, and thither
                  it was necessary for her immediately to proceed. A hasty good-by to all was all
                  she could give, and with mutual good wishes, the widow and those whom in her
                  affliction she had found to be true friends, were parted forever in this
                  world.</p>
               <p>Six weeks after she left her late husband's home in Ohio, Mrs. Dalton and her son
                  arrived at Liverpool.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ashley, regardless for once of the rebukes of the leading members of his
                  congregation, had hastened to Liverpool to meet his sister-in-law as soon as he
                  saw the arrival of the vessel announced in the newspapers. Sorely as the expense
                  cramped him, he had written to an hotel-keeper in Liverpool to meet her on board
                  the ship on his arrival and convey her to his house, and the third day after her
                  arrival, he himself met he there.</p>
               <p>The meeting was a sorrowful one on both sides. Both felt it to be so, though both
                  endeavored as much as possible to disguise their feelings and assume an appearance
                  of cheerfulness they could not feel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ashley could not afford time or money for any delay at the great seaport, and
                  on the following morning the party started for the minister's humble home.</p>
               <p>In that day railroads were unknown, and Mr. Ashley, to widow and her little son,
                  travelled inside the state, the fourth seat of which was occupied by a stranger.
                  It was scarcely daylight when the coach drove out of the hotel yard and rattled
                  over the rough paving stones of dirty, busy Liverpool; but as they advanced into
                  the country, the spirits of the widow, which had been low enough at starting,
                  began to revive as she gazed wistfully on the bright green herbage and the lovely
                  domestic scenery of her native land.</p>
               <p>"Now for the first time, I feel that I am in England again," she said, her eyes
                  sparkling with an animation to which she had long been a stranger. They were the
                  first words that had been spoken since the stage had left the noisy town.</p>
               <p>"May I ask if you have come from the United States, madam?" said the stranger,
                  looking up from the folds of his cloak, which had hitherto been drawn over his
                  face.</p>
               <p>"I have, sir," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"I thought as much," continued the stranger. "You are an Englishwoman, I perceive.
                  I am an American myself, but at present I am residing in Liverpool."</p>
               <p>The stranger now relapsed into silence, but he did not again enfold his features
                  in the folds of his ample travelling cloak. On the contrary, he appeared to gaze
                  with delight upon the ever changing scenery. He was a tall, spare,
                  gentlemanly-looking man, with a keen dark eye, and hair also dark, although
                  slightly grizzled, apparently from the effects of care and anxiety rather than
                  from age, for his years could not much have exceeded thirty.</p>
               <p>Again Mrs. Dalton made some remark upon the beauty of the scenery.</p>
               <p>The stranger answered her.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said he, "your island can boast of lovely scenery; no one will deny that;
                  but you will excuse me for asking, since you have resided in the United States, if
                  you have seen nothing to admire in the scenery there?"</p>
               <p>"<unclear>Much, very much,</unclear>" replied Mrs. Dalton. "The country<pb
                     n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7199-00000037"/> is very different from this, but it
                  possesses a beauty peculiarly its own."</p>
               <p>"I am glad to hear you acknowledge that, madam," said the gentleman, "for to tell
                  the truth, I am too much accustomed to hear your countrymen speak in a tone of
                  superciliousness of the United States. Not that I care much about it, for I am too
                  proud of the growing greatness of my native land to feel anything but contempt for
                  those who traduce it, but it is not pleasant to listen to such remarks, especially
                  when one knows them to be false,"</p>
               <p>"Few would make such remarks who have lived long in America," observed Mrs.
                  Ashley.</p>
               <p>"There I am sorry to differ with you," returned the gentleman; "few of the
                  educated gentlemen of England would make them, but unfortunately, the Englishmen
                  who in these days visit America are of a class that represent their country but
                  very indifferently. Nothing is good enough for them. Everything is better and
                  finer in England, though if that be the case, what on earth leads them to visit a
                  country they affect to despise so much? You must have observed this feeling
                  amongst those of your countrymen whom you may have met in the United States."</p>
               <p>"I was seldom thrown in the way of English people during the whole period I
                  resided in America," answered Mrs. Dalton. "The last four or five years I have
                  spent in Ohio, and I believe there are few of my countrymen settled there, not at
                  least in the part of the State in which I resided."</p>
               <p>"In Ohio!" exclaimed the gentleman; "that is my native State. You have lived
                  there, you say, four or five years. This little boy here," looking towards Gerald,
                  who was listening earnestly to the conversation, "is perhaps a countryman of mine;
                  that is to say, if you resided long in America before you went to Ohio?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Sir, little Gerald was born in the city of New York."</p>
               <p>"Let me welcome you to England, my fine little fellow," said the gentleman, taking
                  Gerald's hand, and patting his cheek. "And at the same time introduce myself as
                  your fellow countryman. My name is Brower, George Brower. What is yours?"</p>
               <p>"Gerald Dalton," replied the boy.</p>
               <p>"Gerald Dalton—Dalton, from Ohio?" exclaimed the gentleman. "May I ask you,
                  Ma'am," addressing Mrs. Datlon "if your husband bought the farm on the road to
                  Port William about ten miles from Cincinnati, now I should think five years ago or
                  thereabouts?"</p>
               <p>"He did, Sir," replied the widow.</p>
               <p>"Then I was once slightly acquainted with him. I come from Cincinnati, myself, and
                  my father owns a farm about four miles distant from your husband's. I don't know
                  how he gets on; well, I hope. But you will excuse me for saying that he made a
                  very sorry bargain when he bought that land. It's the worst on the line of the
                  river for miles."</p>
               <p>"My husband is dead, Sir," said Mr. Dalton, "and the farm belongs to me no
                  longer."</p>
               <p>"Dear me, Madam!" exclaimed the gentleman. "Pardon me for my rudeness. I was
                  foolish not to have perceived that you are in mourning; but I would not have
                  intentionally hurt your feelings."</p>
               <p>The excuse was readily accepted by the widow, for, in truth, there was no cause
                  for offence; but the stranger had touched a tender spot in her breast, and she
                  remained silent.</p>
               <p>With ready tact he changed the subject, and addressed himself to Mr. Ashley,
                  displaying so much intelligence, cheerfulness, and good-humor, that very shortly
                  Mrs. Dalton again joined in the conversation, and before another hour had passed
                  all were talking again of America, and Mrs. Dalton had related how the farm came
                  to be sold.</p>
               <p>"At present," observed Mr. Brower, "the purchaser has got a bad bargain; but,
                  believe me, it will not prove so in the end. It is a pity for the sake of my
                  little Gerald that you<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7199-00000038"/> husband could not
                  have held it. As farming land it will never be worth anything; but one of these
                  days it will be among the most valuable property in the State."</p>
               <p>"All was sold," said Mrs. Dalton, "for less than my husband paid for it, with the
                  exception of a strip bordering close on the river, that no one would buy."</p>
               <p>"And that is still yours?" exclaimed Mr. Brower with animation.</p>
               <p>"It is," replied the widow. "No one, I fancy will be in haste to dispossess me of
                  it."</p>
               <p>"Be not too sure of that," said Mr. Brower, "Have you the title deeds in your
                  possession?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Sir, they are among my late husband's papers."</p>
               <p>"One question more. Had your husband taken out his naturalization papers? Was he a
                  citizen of the United States when he died?"</p>
               <p>"He was. He became a citizen two years before his death."</p>
               <p>"All right then," exclaimed Mr. Brower. "Keep fast hold of the deed, for the sake
                  of your boy. That piece of swamp that you now believe worthless, as it in fact is,
                  will one day be worth twice the value of the rest of the property. Why Gerald, my
                  little countryman, you will one day become a rich American citizen. It may be many
                  years before that happens; but the day will come, as sure as my name is Brower,
                  and yours is Gerald Dalton, my fine little fellow. But I see we are approaching
                  Derby, I alight there. Here is my card, Sir," addressing Mr. Ashley, and handing
                  him a card. "I am the agent for a mercantile house in Cincinnati, and I reside in
                  Liverpool. I shall be happy to see you there, should you visit the town again. I
                  am going to write to Cincinnati next mail, and I will direct my brother to keep a
                  look out after that piece of swamp land. If it were not yours, madam, I could wish
                  it were mine."</p>
               <p>Mr. Ashley exchanged cards with the American. The stage stopped to change horses
                  at Derby, and the traveller alighted, gaily bidding his late fellow travellers
                  good-bye, and shouting aloud from the door of the hotel, "Good-bye, Gerald, my
                  boy," as the stage rattled swiftly away.</p>
               <p>"What do you think of our late companion's notion respecting that bit of land you
                  have been conversing about, Mary?" inquired Mr. Ashley.</p>
               <p>"The American people are ever sanguine," answered the widow. "I do not place much
                  faith in his prophecy."</p>
               <p>"He seems to be a well informed man, and very gentlemanly and frank in his
                  manners," observed her brother-in-law.</p>
               <p>"Most Americans of his class are" replied the widow; "far more intelligent and
                  gentlemanly than the same class in England. I have said no more than the truth;
                  there is indeed much to admire in the United States and in its people. Nor was he
                  far wrong in the estimation of too many of the English who visit the United
                  States."</p>
               <p>"It is a pity that such foolish prejudices should exist," said Mr. Ashley. "I
                  should much like to visit America."</p>
               <p>"And you would be much pleased with all you saw there," returned the widow. "Poor
                  Charles had much to contend with; had he in early life been trained to labor and
                  to depend upon his own exertions, things would have been very different with him,
                  poor fellow! but it was no fault of his. Both he and I had much to unlearn and
                  much to learn when we first set foot on American soil. We were both at fault, and
                  poor Charles bitterly paid the penalty of his mistake."</p>
               <p>The conversation ceased, and both Mr. Ashley and the widow sat silently, occupied
                  with their own thoughts, only occasionally interrupted by the childish prattle of
                  little Gerald.</p>
               <p>Several times the stage stopped to change horse, and at last, and night drew on,
                  the passengers all removed into another stage. It was a long weary journey from
                  Liverpool to the town in which Mr. Ashley resided, and they travelled all night,
                  little Gerald sleeping soundly in his mother's lap, and Mr. Ashley and the widow
                  sleeping and waking by fits and starts<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7199-00000039"/> as
                  people do sleep and wake in stages. The daylight seemed as if it would never
                  re-appear; but it came at last, displaying in all its fresh spring verdure the
                  sweet scenery of the county of Kent, and by ten o'clock the stage entered
                  Herrington. Mr. Ashley was once more at home, and a fresh sorrow, not unmingled
                  with joy, awaited the widow in meeting the only sister of her late beloved
                  husband.</p>
               <p>A few minutes' walk from the coach office, took the travellers to the minister's
                  humble abode, where Mrs. Ashley, who was expecting her husband's return, had
                  everything prepared in her power to give them a hearty welcome.</p>
               <p>Little Gerald was introduced to his cousins and the little orphan guest of the
                  household, and the first joy and grief of the meeting over, and every one
                  refreshed with a homely but plentiful breakfast, the ladies retired to talk and
                  perchance to weep over times gone by, and Gerald was taken by his cousins to
                  inspect their toys and treasures, while Mr. Ashley, tired as he was with his long
                  journey, was obliged to forego his much needed rest, for the present, and to set
                  hard to work to redeem his lost time, and endeavor to satisfy the rigid exactions
                  of the leading members and elders of his flock.</p>

                  <p>Showing who prove to be friends in time of trouble, and attesting to the truth
                     of the old adage, "A friend in need is a friend indeed."</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MR. ASHLEY certainly had sufficient on his hands, for in addition to his clerical
                  duties, the task devolved upon him of educating his two sons, Frederick and Henry,
                  (the twins were girls, and, as I have observed, still infants,) Alice Thornton,
                  the orphan child alluded to in the foregoing chapter, and little Gerald Dalton,
                  his nephew, for he was quite unable to pay for their tuition elsewhere. Frederick,
                  the elders on of Mr. Ashley, was about the age of Gerald, as also was Alice
                  Thornton; Henry was two years younger, but still old enough to require the
                  attention of a preceptor, and all the overburdened minister's spare time was
                  occupied in teaching these children; but otherwise, the arrival of his nephew and
                  sister-in-law did not impose upon him the additional burden he had anticipated,
                  since Mrs. Dalton, by her skill and industry as a needlewoman, was soon able to
                  support herself and her child, though she still remained beneath the roof of her
                  brother-in-law.</p>
               <p>Two years passed away, during which period the difficulties already hinted at as
                  occurring between Mr. Ashley and the leading members of his congregation greatly
                  increased. The minister was a patient, much-enduring, long-suffering man; in all
                  reasonable things he endeavored to conform as much as possible to the wishes of
                  others; but patience has its limits, and his deacons at length became so
                  capricious, and at the same time so exacting, that the long smothered discontent
                     on<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7199-00000040"/> both sides broke out into open
                  warfare, and one Sabbath morning Mr. Ashley announced his resignation from the
                  pulpit, greatly to the astonishment of Deacon Milton, who had no idea that it was
                  possible for the harassed pastor to take so decided, and, as he thought, so
                  desperate a step, and greatly to the regret of many of the poorer members of the
                  chapel, who had taken no part in the various controversies between the minister
                  and the deacons, and who only knew the former as a good and zealous pastor, and a
                  kind hearted man, ever ready to offer his sympathy in the hour of trouble, though
                  he had nothing else to give.</p>
               <p>The deacons, in obedience to the general desire of the congregation, endeavored to
                  induce the minister to change his mind; they even, after finding all other
                  attempts fail, offered to increase his salary to seventy pounds a year, in their
                  opinion a munificent mark of generosity, but the offer had come too late, and Mr.
                  Ashley courteously but positively declined to continue in the exercise of the
                  duties of his sacred office.</p>
               <p>He had not arrived at this determination without due consideration. He had advised
                  with Dr. Knight and Mr. Pearce, the vicar of the parish, the only friends with
                  whom he could advise, and he had resolved upon opening a school for boarders and
                  day scholars, in the belief that he should find the profession of a schoolmaster
                  at least as remunerative as that from which he was about to retire. There was, to
                  be sure, another boarding and day school in the town, a long established, highly
                  respectable school, with three or four tutors, besides the principal, to which
                  most of the well-to-do residents—and the town was but small—sent their children.
                  Still Mr. Ashley believed there was room for another academy, and if there were
                  not day scholars enough to make it pay, why should he not succeed in obtaining
                  boarders from a distance, as well as Mr. Clarke, the other schoolmaster?</p>
               <p>So in a short time a house was rented with the necessary accommodations, in front
                  of which a sign-board was put up with the words "PROSPECT HOUSE CLASSICAL AND
                  COMMERICAL ACADEMY" painted upon it in big letters, and circulars were distributed
                  freely, which informed the townspeople and strangers that at Prospect House
                  Academy, young gentlemen could be instructed in the ordinary branches of English
                  education be instructed in the ordinary branches of English education at a
                  moderate cost, and for certain extra charges enumerated, in Mathematics, Algebra,
                  Astronomy, and the Use of the Globes, Drawing, Latin, Greek, and the Modern
                  Languages. A few young gentlemen, also, could be received as boarders for the sum
                  of twenty-five pounds per annum, paid quarterly in advance every attention being
                  paid to their comfort by Mrs. Ashley, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But alas! fortune seemed to frown upon Mr. Ashley in all his undertakings; very
                  few of the children of the townspeople came to his school, and these not the
                  children of the more respectable class; and as to parents at a distance, they
                  remained perfectly indifferent to the fact that board and tuition in the English
                  language and all the comforts of a home were offered their children by the
                  proprietor of Prospect House Classical and Commercial Academy.</p>
               <p>The inevitable result was, that after two years of desperate struggle, Mr. Ashley
                  was arrested for debt, while in London during the vacation, endeavoring to borrow
                  money, and consigned to the Fleet Prison.</p>
               <p>This was a dreadful blow to his unhappy wife and family, though the children were
                  still too young to feel the whole weight of its severity. Things took their usual
                  course. An inventory was taken of the furniture and effects of the bankrupt, and
                  Mrs. Ashley removed with the children into humbler lodgings, to which, however,
                  her sister and niece did not accompany her, Mrs. Dalton having taken separate
                  lodgings for herself and Gerald, who was now a fine boy of twelve years old, and
                  also relieving Mrs. Ashley of the charge of Alice Thornton.</p>
               <p>There was great commotion in the little town when the bankruptcy of Mr. Ashley
                  became generally known. It was astonishing<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7199-00000041"
                  /> ing to learn how often the event had been mentally predicted, although until it
                  occurred, no one had ever breathed the prediction to his neighbor; and equally
                  astonishing was it t learn to how many different causes the misfortune was
                  attributed.</p>
               <p>"I knew it would come to this when Mr. Ashley resigned his charge over Zion
                  Chapel," observed Mr. Milton to a neighbor whom he met while taking his morning
                  walk on the pier. "When people grow proud and stiff-necked, and greedy of riches,
                  they are sure to meet with a fall. It'll be a desperate blow to the family. He'll
                  never recover it."</p>
               <p>"Don't bear too hard on the poor man, now he's fell into misfortunate," was the
                  reply of the person addressed, an honest farmer, who was personally unacquainted
                  with the minister, but who sympathized with him and his family in their trouble.
                  "And the poor wife and children," he continued, "what'll they do?"</p>
               <p>"Do as best they can," returned the deacon, "when folks go beyond their means,
                  they deserve to suffer. There was aller's too much pride about Ashley, and now
                  he's reaping its fruits."</p>
               <p>"Poor fellow! in prison," said the farmer. "But, you say, they must do as best
                  they can. What means of support have they? You know they musn't starve"—</p>
               <p>"Oh, they won't starve; if I thought that likely, why, I'd try and get up a small
                  subscription for them myself, though they have no claim on me or any of
                     <emph>us,</emph> since Ashley left Zion Chapel. Mr. Pearce, and Dr. Knight I
                  have been told sent Mrs. Ashley some money, as a loan. I have no doubt that such
                  is the case."</p>
               <p>"Well, I'm glad to hear that at any rate," returned the farmer. "And he, the
                  minister as was, he'll get his sartificate I s'pose,"—</p>
               <p>"Oh aye—in a month or so. Meanwhile a little confinement won't do him any harm.
                  It'll humble him and his family, and teach 'em to know their places better in
                  future," replied Deacon Milton, as he turned away in the direction of his
                  house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clarke had predicted, so he said, the very day that he heard Mr. Ashley was
                  about opening a rival Academy, that his presumption would meet with a check.
                     <emph>He</emph> to think of succeeding in establishing a school! It was only a
                  source of wonder to Mr. Clarke that he had not failed sooner. "He ought to," added
                  that worthy and conscientious man "for it's downright robbery for a man to try to
                  keep afloat when he feels himself sinking all the time."</p>
               <p>Varirous other reasons were given to account for the misfortunes of the poor
                  schoolmaster; but the general belief amongst the gossips ws that he was one of
                  those unhappy men whom Fortune constantly plays football with, and consequently it
                  was useless to sympathize with him, and would be foolish to endeavor to assist
                  him. This last opinion, being a very satisfactory one, inasmuch as it saved a
                  great deal of pain, and trouble, was pretty generally accepted, and amidst these
                  conflicting opinions Mrs. Ashley and the children might have starved or gone to
                  the parish poor-house, but for the kindness of the vicar and the doctor, both of
                  whom visited the family, and afforded them such temporary assistance as they stood
                  in need of.</p>
               <p>They had, however, still another friend, who was willing to serve them in his
                  humble way, and this was Jemmy Milton, the brother of the deacon. This man been a
                  sailor, but had retired from the sea some years before on the occasion of his
                  receiving a legacy left by an older brother, whose life had also been spent at
                  sea, who had accumulated a handsome competency. There were, however, certain
                  restrictions imposed upon Jemmy Milton by his brother's will. The greater portions
                  of this brother's wealth had been bequeathed to deacon Thomas Milton, who was
                  possessed besides of considerable property. Jemmy only came into the possession of
                  a small annuity of fifty pounds, which was left in the possession<pb n="82-83"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000042"/> the deacon, to be by him applied in the manner he
                  thought most advisable for the younger brother's benefit. For some time Jemmy had
                  received it in quarterly payments, and as he still owned a fishing boat, and
                  earned some money as a fisherman, he managed to maintain himself as decently as he
                  cared to do; but within a year or two, Jemmy had prevailed upon his brother to
                  change the method he had originally adopted.</p>
               <p>The fact is, unjust as it may seem, there was reason in the unequal distribution
                  of his property by the oldest brother, Richard Milton. He knew that his brother
                  Thomas, niggardly as he was by nature, would not allow Jemmy to suffer from want;
                  and he knew also, that if Jemmy had a thousand pounds a year to spend, he would
                  spend it all recklessly, and feel the pressure of want before the year was
                  ended—Jemmy was content, may proud, to earn his living as a fisherman, although he
                  had ceased to go long voyages to sea as a sailor. The fifty pounds a year was
                  pocket-money for the purchase of luxuries. Had it been five times fifty, Jemmy
                  would not have worked as a fisherman; would not have been half so happy and
                  contented as he was, and would have spent foolishly the larger sum, while he
                  husbanded the smaller one, with, for him, some degree of caution.</p>
               <p>Having formed a resolve, that as long as he was able his labor should supply him
                  with the actual necessaries of life, he was just as fully resolved not to earn any
                  more than sufficed to procure these necessaries, but he found, after a fair trial,
                  that the quarters came round slowly, and that when they did come, and he received
                  his usual quarterly pittance of twelve pounds ten shillings, the next payment was
                  at a date so far distant that he was pretty sure to be out of pocket money long
                  before it arrived. It would have been just the same had the quarterly allowance
                  been doubled or trebled. So Jemmy hit upon a novel scheme. One day, when he was in
                  the act of receiving his little pittance from the hands of his brother, the
                  following conversation took place between them.</p>
               <p>"Now Jemmy," said the deacon, "try and take care of that money. A little spent
                  to-day and a little to-morrow, and so forth, and it will last well enough till
                  next quarter. I will take care of it for you if you like, and you can get it from
                  me just as you fancy." Jemmy looked at the money as it lay on the table before
                  him. He gave an extra twist to the chew of pigtail tobacco he held in this mouth,
                  scratched his head and seemed half inclined to close with his brother's proposal;
                  but the prospect of the forthcoming jollification was too much for his prudence,
                  and he swept the money into his hand, and thrust it into his pocket.</p>
               <p>"I'll tell ye what, Tummas," he said, "I must take the money as it is this time, I
                  can't 'conomize this bout, but for the future I'd like to sail on another tack.
                  D'ye see twelve pound ten's a heap of money to spend—It's a short homeward bound
                  v'yage—While I've got it to spend, I'll spend it like a man; but, if so be, as I
                  hadn't got so much to spend, why I couldn't spend it, in coorse, and the odds is,
                  I should be just as well satisfied."</p>
               <p>"Just so, Jemmy," replied the deacon, "just so, now suppose from this time I give
                  you the money monthly, or weekly, if you life, what do you say to that?"</p>
               <p>"That it's very sensible; but it won't do no ways"—answered Jemmy. "It comes to
                  this, I feels the want of a jollification at sartain times, and I wants money to
                  carry it out, and enough money to carry it our properly too, but not so much as
                  this here. Now I wants you to pay me a shilling a day, soger's pay, Tummas, till
                  the quarter comes round, and then I'll take the balance. I shall allus have money
                  in my purse to buy my porter and bacca then, and something to go on a spree with
                  at the end of the quarter, as usual."</p>
               <p>The deacon, after vainly endeavoring to induce his brother to make some wiser
                  arrangement, consented at length, to Jemmy's proposition, and from that time
                  forward Jemmy received and spent his shilling a day, and had his quarterly payment
                  reduced to eight pounds.</p>
               <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7199-00000043"/>
               <p>Deacon Milton often attempted to give his brother moral advice; but it was
                  entirely thrown away upon him, for Jemmy with all his simplicity, was shrewd
                  enough to read his brother's character perfectly, and to know that on the score of
                  morality, it would scarcely compare favorably with his own—for he was no
                  debauchee—nor was given to any vice. His money was not spent in drink or
                  dissipation, but rather flung away foolishly, given to every one that asked for
                  it, so long as he had a penny remaining to give.</p>
               <p>With the boys of the town Jemmy Milton was an universal favorite. He was always
                  ready to join them in their amusements; to take them out to sea in his boat; to
                  build and rigtoy ships for them, and to spin yarns of such absorbing interest to
                  his youthful auditors, that they would listen greedily to them for hours
                  together.</p>
               <p>Gerald Dalton, who was a boy of a courageous and generous disposition, was
                  especially a favorite of the old fisherman's. He had often accompanied him home to
                  assist in the construction of some new toy, or to teach the boy how to rig a ship
                  properly, and he was among the few who really sympathized with the unfortunate
                  uncle of his favorite.</p>
               <p>A day or two after Mrs. Dalton had removed to her new lodgings, Jemmy met Gerald
                  and Alice, walking on the beach.</p>
               <p>Evincing a delicacy of feeling that few would have suspected him of possessing,
                  the rough old fisherman hesitated to approach them for some moments, for fear they
                  should think he wished to pry into the secrets of the misfortune that had befallen
                  them; but, at length, upbraiding his own folly, he advanced towards them, and
                  observed that he had not seen Gerald for several days. "We have moved, Jemmy,"
                  said Gerald. "Alice and I don't live with Aunt Ashley, now."</p>
               <p>"No! where do you live, then?"</p>
               <p>Gerald gave him the information he asked for, and he desired the boy to tell his
                  mother that Jemmy Milton was coming to call upon her that evening.</p>
               <p>"Oh, do Jemmy, do," cried Gerald and Alice, in a breath, "Won't we be glad, and"
                  added Gerald, "You'll tell mother the funny tale about the Alligators, won't you.
                  She's so dull sometimes. It'll make her laugh won't it, Alice?"</p>
               <p>"Your mother's dull, is she?" said the old fisherman, "well, well, stormy weather
                  comes upon us all times. It can't be helped, and 'what can't be coored must be
                  endoor'd,' as the copy book says. But, tell her to cheer up bravely, and all 'll
                  come out right in the end."</p>
               <p>Gerald promised to deliver the message to his mother, and walked homeward with the
                  little girl.</p>
               <p>"Now what an old fool I be, to send sich a message as that, arter all," said the
                  old man, as he stood watching the children. "She'll think, the Widow Dalton
                  will—no, no, she won't be quite so silly as that, nuther," he continued, after a
                  pause, slapping his leg with the palm of his hard hand, and chuckling heartily at
                  some ridiculous fancy. "She won't the quite so silly as to think I means anything
                  improper, sich as makin up luv—an old weather beaten chap like me, to sich a young
                  widder as she be. She'll have more gumption than that comes to; but how the
                  dickens I'm to get over it, I don't know. Mebby, I'd better have gone to Mrs.
                  Ashley at oncet; but its ork'ard bisness—very ork'ard business, any how."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dalton certainly was surprised at the intimation that she was to expect a
                  visit from Jemmy Milton that evening. She could not conceive what it was the old
                  fisherman whom she had never spoken to and whom she only knew as the brother of
                  Deacon Milton, could want with her. However, not being able to conceive what he
                  could want, she thought no more about it until the time appointed by Jemmy
                  arrived.</p>
               <p>He was true to the minute, and after having sent up his name by the woman of the
                  house who opened the door to him, he was at the request of Mrs Dalton, shown up
                  stairs.</p>
               <p>"I hope you're well well, marm," he said, as he entered the room, first giving his
                  trowsers a hitch, and then bowing<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7199-00000044"/> sailor
                  fashion, and jerking alarmingly at the forelock of his hair.</p>
               <p>"Your name is Milton, Sir, Mr. James Milton," said the widow.</p>
               <p>"Jemmy Milton, or plain Jemmy, at your sarvice, marm," replied the old fisherman,
                  with another awkward bow, and another pull at the unfortunate forelock.</p>
               <p>"Pray, be seated, Sir, I am glad to see you."</p>
               <p>"I am glad to hear that, Marm," said the old man. "Because, d'ye see, I somehow
                  thought as I might be intrudin'."</p>
               <p>"By no means. My little boy——"</p>
               <p>"And a right smart boy he is, marm," interrupted Jemmy.</p>
               <p>"My little boy," continued the widow, "has told me that you wished to see me on
                  business this evening. May I ask what it is about?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>To</emph> be sure, <emph>to</emph> be sure," returned the old man. "That's
                  comin' right to the pint at oncet. That saves a great deal of trouble. But—"and he
                  looked at the children, and whispered in a voice, however, sufficiently loud for
                  them to hear, "I shouldn't like, marm, to speak right afore the children. It's a
                  delicate subject as I've come about."</p>
               <p>Much surprised at the old man's remarks, Mrs. Dalton requested the children to
                  retire to the bedroom, the only other apartment she possessed, and after Jemmy had
                  thrice vainly attempted to clear his throat, for he spoke in a hoarser voice than
                  usual, he proceeded to explain the object of his unexpected call.</p>
               <p>"You see, marm," he said, "I'm only a rough seafarin' man laid up in ordinary, as
                  I may say; but I know'd Mr. Ashley, marm, and I respects him. <emph>Darned if I
                     don't!</emph>" he exclaimed with emphasis, dashing his hat upon the floor to
                  give greater force to the expression. "And I think he ain't been kindly dealt with
                  by my brother, Deacon Tummas. "He's fell into misfortin, marm, and I respects a
                  man as falls into misfortin' and bears it <emph>like</emph> a man—as I knows he
                  does. Now, I'm comin to the pint, and you'll excuse me when I say, as it was
                  quarter day yesterday, and I've got a little matter o' money, which I ain't got
                  any use for whatsomever, and which I should like some keerful body to keep for me,
                  to use, you know, and pay me some day, when I wants it, which won't be p'raps for
                  a year or more. D'ye see, marm. I'm beginning to think as I ought to lay by
                  something, altho' I'm as hearty as ever I was for the matter o' that."</p>
               <p>Jemmy hauled out the eight pounds he had that morning received from the Deacon,
                  and laying the gold on the table, seemed to be awaiting Mrs. Dalton's reply. But
                  the widow did not speak; she new not what to make of the old fisherman's remarks.
                  She knew him to be an eccentric character, and had heard that he was profuse in
                  the expenditure of the little money that fell into his possession, and she had an
                  inkling of his object, still she scarcely knew what to reply.</p>
               <p>Observing her silence the old man resumed:—</p>
               <p>"I see, marm, as you don't rightly understand me, and no wonder. A man ain't to be
                  understood when he don't speak out plain, to the purpose, as a man ought to do. To
                  come right to the pint then, I wish you to give this here small matter o' money as
                  a loan to Mrs. Ashley. Don't tell her who lent it her: say, please, that a friend
                  sent it who respects her husband, and I wish it wur more—<emph>there.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Jemmy emphasized this last word, as if it had eased his mind of a troublesome
                  load, and Mrs. Dalton, as she looked at him, could not help admiring the
                  generosity of character that beamed in his eye. The weather-beaten old man looked
                  positively handsome.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Ashley," she said, after a pause, "has met with many kind friends in her
                  trouble. Mr. Pearce and Dr. Knight have been very kind to her. I feel your
                  kindness much; but excuse me, Mr. Milton, you are not rich. You will have need of
                  this money."</p>
               <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7199-00000045"/>
               <p>"Not at all, marm, not at all," replied the old fisherman. "I can allus earn my
                  living while God gives me strength, and independent of that, I has my shilling a
                  day, for baccy and drink, and this here sum of eight pounds every quarter. More by
                  token, my brother Tummas, close as he is, wouldn't let me want, if my old hulk
                  should give way and lay me up in ordinary. You see I didn't like to make the
                  offer, direct, myself to Mrs. Ashley, seeing as I didn't know her, so I thought it
                  'd be more delicate like to make it through you."</p>
               <p>Observing that Mrs. Dalton still hesitated, he added:—"Supposing you don't take
                  the money, it 'ill do me no good, nor nobody no good. I shall go down to the
                  boathouse, under the cliff, and treat all the boatmen and may be they'll lose a
                  day's work in consekence."</p>
               <p>"I will accept your kind offer in behalf of my sister, Mr. Milton," said Mrs.
                  Dalton, "but you must permit me to tell her to whom she is indebted."</p>
               <p>"Not at all, not at all," said Jemmy. "Say a friend of her husband's, and a friend
                  of the minister's, that's all. And now, marm, I wish you good evening." And
                  without waiting for further acknowledgments, the old fisherman left the room.</p>
               <p>The generous donation of the honest old fisherman was of essential service to Mrs.
                  Ashley, who, with all the kindness of the few friends who sympathized with her
                  husband's misfortunes, found it difficult to get along with her large family, thus
                  left so dependent solely upon her exertions.</p>
               <p>It was not long, however, before her husband was restored to her. He found little
                  difficulty in getting his certificate, for it was proved in court that his
                  bankruptcy had been caused by misfortunes over which he had no control, and he was
                  discharged. Some friend likewise assisted him with a trifling loan, and he
                  returned to his family, with the intention of opening a school in a village on the
                  sea coast, a few miles distant from Herrington. It was a small watering place to
                  which he retired, much frequented in summer on account of its excellent advantages
                  for sea-bathing, and he thought here there was a probability of success.</p>
               <p>Thither he removed with his wife and children, leaving Mrs. Dalton and her son and
                  Alice Thornton in the town, where for some years she had earned a living, poor
                  enough, it is true, but still a living for herself and her boy, with her
                  needle.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Contains some account of Herrington and its inhabitants, and tells how Gerald
                     Dalton made up his mind to leave home and seek his fortune.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT was not the best situation for a high spirited boy of twelve years old to be
                  placed in, that in which Gerald Dalton was placed in now. Debarred by his mother's
                  want of means from the advantages of a regular school education, for Mr. Ashley
                  had removed too far off for him to attend his school any longer, he was dependent
                  for such instruction, as she had time to give, upon his mother; but she had but
                  little leisure during the day-time to bestow upon him, and the consequence was,
                  that, although a well-disposed boy, much of the time that ought to have been
                  employed in study was spent in wandering abroad, and though in obedience to his
                  mother's wishes, he kept himself aloof from the vicious boys of the neighborhood,
                  such a training as this, for a boy of his years, necessarily led to a love of
                  roaming and a disaffection to steady, settled pursuits, calculated to have a bad
                  influence over him when, after a lapse of a year or two more, he should commence
                  to earn his own living and to learn to depend upon his own exertions.</p>
               <p>A great portion of his time was spent upon the sea beach, watching the operations
                  of the sailors, boatmen, and fishermen, or listening to their marvelous
                  yarns—Jemmy Milton standing pre-eminent as a narrator of wonderful stories.
                  Nothing, in fact, was too stupendously marvelous to cause Jemmy to hesitate.
                  Whether in his younger years he had read Gulliver's travels, and Baron
                  Munchausen's adventures, and the History of Robinson Crusoe, and mingled the whole
                  together and thought over them until he believed them true, and himself to have
                  been an actor in the wonderful adventures through which these heroes passed, or
                  whether his marvelous stories were the product of his own imagination, aided by a
                  recollection of the scenes he had witnessed during a long and adventurous ocean
                  career, I cannot say, but it is certain that Jemmy had become so habituated to
                  dealing in the marvelous, that he actually believed what he said, and told his
                  stories with so much sententious gravity, never allowing a muscle of his face to
                  relax, although the listeners were convulsed with laughter, that to the boys in
                  Herrington he was a living story-book, always full of new fairy tales and
                  wonderful adventures by sea and land, infinitely more amusing than any printed
                  story-book they had ever read, while overgrown men listened to him with wonder and
                  admiration; but then, with the few exceptions that always go to prove the rule,
                  the inhabitants of Herrington were not remarkable for refinement or
                  intelligence.</p>
               <p>Steam and the electric telegraph have done great wonders for Herrington, which is
                  now a thriving seaport and fashionable watering place, possessing several
                  admirably appointed hotels, elegant streets and piers, and numerous villas
                  situated on the summit of its lofty cliff, affording a glorious view of the
                  straits, and on fine, clear days, of the French Coast opposite, at a distance of
                  some twenty-five or thirty miles. It is now, in fact, the chief outlet to the
                  continent, and the first place that the continental visitor sets foot on visiting
                  England. Where in former day lay the Dutch galliot, discharging its cargo of
                  cheese and eggs, direct from Holland, or the single-masted "hoy," waiting to
                  convey passengers to the channel ports, may now be seen the packet steamers, just
                  returned from or just about to depart for Boulogne, freighted with passengers of
                  all ranks of life, and the bustle now observable upon the quays, would have
                  astonished the inhabitants of Herrington of the past generation<pb n="92-93"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000047"/> eration. The Dutch galliots, with their quaint
                  crews and odd cargoes, may still be seen; but the modest, humble hoy, has gone the
                  way of the old stage coach, and is now among the things that were.</p>
               <p>Yet Herrington boasts of great antiquity, and according to its inhabitants, once
                  possessed seven churches, and streets and houses, stretching far out where now
                  flows the sea, which according to ancient legend has encroached upon miles of
                  land, and undermined and crumbled vast masses of the huge cliffs, the remnants of
                  which, while they seem to bid defiance to its further encroachments, still to this
                  day suffer from its never ceasing process of undermining; but the men of
                  Herrington, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"——Grown wiser than of yore,</l>
                        <l>Build rearward now, who seaward built before."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> At the period of which I write, and for many years before, the ostensible
                  occupation of the greater portion of its inhabitants had been that of fishing and
                  curing red herrings. From this latter occupation, probably, was derived its
                  euphonious designation. But the real occupation of the people, "and that in which
                  they took the most delight," was smuggling. For several generations the
                  Herringtonians had been smugglers, root and branch. The wealthy residents, and
                  there were several possessed of considerable wealth, had made their fortunes by
                  contraband trade and then retired from the profession. The mayor, and the members
                  of the corporation, the town clerk, and the parish clerk, the beadle, the town
                  crier and the very watchmen, had been or were all more or less concerned in this
                  nefarious occupation. Probably there was not a resident of the place, excepting
                  the vicar, and the dissenting minister, and the doctor, and the schoolmaster, that
                  had not been more or less a smuggler. As to the lawyer, the only lawyer the town
                  boasted, he was well known to be the mot successful smuggler of the lot. Smuggling
                  was, however, on the wane. The vigilance exercised by the officers of the
                  coast-guard, had rendered it more perilous and less profitable than of old, and
                  the wealthy few who had retired from the business now professed to look upon it
                  with holy horror.</p>
               <p>This occupation, carried on for years, and looked upon as the natural destiny of a
                  Herringtonian, although it had in some respects rendered them shrewd, brave, and
                  sharp-witted, had not been favorable to the progress of education, and probably a
                  body of people more ignorant of "book-learning," as they contemptuously expressed
                  themselves when speaking of education, was not to be found in Great Britain. It is
                  a well known historical fact, that towards the close of the last century, the
                  Board of Admiralty in London, sent orders to the mayors of all the channel ports
                  to whitewash the land marks in order to render them more readily recognizable to
                  mariners. Herrington church, perched high upon the cliffs, was a well known land
                  mark, and the mayor of Herrington received an order to the same effect as his
                  compeers. His worship was overpowered with conflicting emotions of delight and
                  consternation. Arrant smuggler as he had been, he was elated at the idea of
                  receiving a communication in his official capacity from the Board of Admiralty;
                  but the matter was one of too great importance, in his estimation, to be decided
                  upon without holding a consultation with his civic advisers. The corporation was
                  forthwith assembled to hold a special meeting in the Town Hall, and in a flutter
                  of agitation the mayor handed the official letter to the town clerk, to read.
                  "Reading and writing coming by nature, and being no gift of fortune," as honest
                  Dogberry hath it, was not one of his worship's qualifications.</p>
               <p>The document was read, or rather spelled through by the clerk.</p>
               <p>"We must appropriate a sum of money to this purpose immediately," said the mayor,
                  when the clerk had finished the reading, looking round with conscious dignity upon
                  the assembled civic officers.</p>
               <p>"May it please your worship," said an old alderman, rising<pb n="94-95"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000048"/> from his seat, "there is more room for discussion
                  and reflection in this order than your worship perceives."</p>
               <p>"Ha! what is that?" said the mayor. "To me it seems clear enough. What say you,
                  gentlemen?" addressing the remainder of the Board.</p>
               <p>"Has your worship observed," continued the alderman, "that their gracious
                  lordships have not said what color the church is to be whitewashed?"</p>
               <p>"No," responded half a dozen voices. "We must send to London for further
                  explanation before we proceed. Their lordships have evidently forgot to state what
                  color the church is to be whitewashed."</p>
               <p>The mayor was convinced. He marveled that he had not noticed the omission before,
                  but it might be a mistake of their own. The clerk was ordered to read the document
                  again. No, there was no mention of the color, and forthwith the clerk was directed
                  to draw out a letter of inquiry, to which the mayor and aldermen each affixed "+,
                  his mark," requesting the necessary instructions, to which it is presumed a reply
                  was duly received, for in process of time the church
                  was—<emph>white</emph>washed.</p>
               <p>A story also is told of the Herringtonians, to the effect, that fearful of
                  contagion, once upon a time, when the small-pox was raging violently in a
                  neighboring village, they stretched fishing nets around the town to keep out the
                  horrible disease; but this story is not so well authenticated as the latter, and
                  many persons incline to believe that it is a malicious libel cast upon the
                  Herringtonians by some of their envious neighbors.</p>
               <p>Encounters between the coast-guardmen and the smugglers were by no means of rare
                  occurrence, nor were the magistrates at all prompt in rendering their official aid
                  to the officers of the government in these instances; for, although they professed
                  to frown upon the offence against the laws, even those who no longer traded in
                  contraband themselves could not dispossess themselves of the fellow feeling that
                  make us wondrous drous kind towards certain sins of others. It was not an uncommon
                  sight to witness a stalwart smuggler, who had been captured, led to prison between
                  a file of coast-guardmen with their officers at their head, all with their swords
                  drawn to be in readiness to oppose any attempt at rescue that might be made, and
                  that but for these precautions, would have been made; and as the prisoner passed
                  haughtily along the streets, carelessly smoking his pipe while surrounded by his
                  captors, windows would be thrown up, sometimes those of the houses of the
                  magistrates, and fair ladies would wave their handkerchiefs in sympathy with the
                  shouts of the populace, encouraging the offender against the laws, and bidding him
                  be of good cheer.</p>
               <p>It was in the midst of such a population as this that Gerald Dalton lived from the
                  age of eight to fourteen years, and during the last two years of this period he
                  was free from the salutary restraints that would have been imposed upon him had he
                  regularly frequented a school.</p>
               <p>However, the anxious care of his mother preserved him from the effects of many of
                  the evil influences that might otherwise have operated dangerously upon his young
                  mind.</p>
               <p>That which she most dreaded was the effects of his companionship with boys of his
                  own age, who, not subjected to the moral restraints, nor influenced by the
                  teachings her own boy found at home might counteract her endeavors; and she
                  endeavored, as much as possible, to render his home, and the society he found
                  there, attractive to him.</p>
               <p>In this effort, she in a great measure succeeded, and his evenings were generally
                  spent at home, where he was sometimes engaged in study, and sometimes in reading
                  aloud to his mother and Alice Thornton.</p>
               <p>Gerald, however, had formed a strong attachment of Jemmy Milton, and he was never
                  so happy as when he could catch the old fisherman alone, mending his nets or
                  repairing his boats, and entice him to talk of the strange scenes he had
                     witnessed<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7199-00000049"/> and the perilous adventures
                  he had passed through on the ocean and in foreign lands. Though he was sometimes a
                  little staggered by the fabulous tone of Jemmy's yarns, he generally received them
                  as truth, and often wished that he could witness such strange sights and dare such
                  perils.</p>
               <p>Setting aside the glaring improbability of Jemmy's stories, they were neither
                  dangerous nor immoral. Indeed, in his wildest flights of imagination, it would
                  appear that he endeavored to convey some moral to his listeners, and the
                  kind-hearted though eccentric old man was never so happy himself as when he had a
                  happy group of children round him and witnessed the delight they derived from
                  hearing him tell his wondrous stories.</p>
               <p>Thus two years passed away, and Gerald Dalton and Alice Thornton were each
                  fourteen years old. Gerald, although he had missed the educational advantages
                  possessed by boys more favored by fortune than he had been, was a well informed
                  lad. Mrs. Dalton was a lady of superior education, although reduced in
                  circumstances, as the reader is aware; and in some respects, perhaps Gerald had
                  profited more by his home instructions than he would have done at school, and he
                  had acquired a refinement of manner from the constant society of his mother and
                  Alice, which most favorably distinguished him from the generality of the town
                  boys.</p>
               <p>It was now time that he should be bound apprentice to some trade or profession, or
                  go into some office in which he could learn to maintain himself, and the knowledge
                  of this and the difficulty of finding a place suitable for him was a great source
                  of anxiety and trouble to Mrs. Dalton.</p>
               <p>Gerald had a taste for drawing, and it was his mother's desire that he should make
                  it useful to him, as it would be if he were to become an engraver, and although
                  the boy was willing to follow her wishes, his own fancy leaned to some more
                  adventurous life, he cared little what, provided it gave occupation to his daring
                  spirit. But his mother shrunk from the thought of this; and yet, to place him in
                  the office of a merchant, or the shop of a tradesman, would require a fee beyond
                  her means. She resolved at length, after much thought, to consult with Doctor
                  Knight and the vicar upon the subject.</p>
               <p>One day Gerald had, as usual, when he had a leisure hour to spare from the studies
                  to which Mrs. Dalton kept him confined as closely as she thought advisable,
                  strolled down to the beach in the hope of meeting with Jemmy Milton. He found the
                  old man in the boat-house mending his nets, and whistling merrily the tune of an
                  old sea-song. A mug of beer stood on a bench by his side, on which also lay his
                  pipe.</p>
               <p>"Ah Gerald, my boy," said he, as the youth entered the boat-house, "so you've come
                  to have a chat with old Jemmy, have ye. Well, sit down, take care of the pipe
                  though, don't break that.—There, that'll do. Well, what's the news at home?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing," replied Gerald, who appeared to be in lower spirits than usual. The old
                  fisherman observed this.</p>
               <p>"Why, Gerry, boy," he said, "you seem dull and mopish to-day. You're not sick,
                  eh?"</p>
               <p>"No," replied the youth, "I'm pretty well, Jemmy."</p>
               <p>"Then you should never be down-hearted. I hold it a sin and a shame to be
                  downhearted, in God's world, where there is so much to enjoy, if enybody only
                  takes the right view of things. If it storms to-day, why what's the odds, it's
                  more like to be sunshine to-morrow. No good ever comes o'mopin." And the old man
                  sung in a cheerful voice, a snatch of a song as was his habit often in the midst
                  of a conversation. <q>

               <p>"There's good sound sense in that 'ere ditty, Master Gerald, if the world only
                  knowed it," he said, as he ceased singing.</p>
               <p>"I am not down-hearted without a cause," replied Gerald.</p>
               <p>"Why, what's the matter, boy?" asked the old man; "you said there was nothing the
                  matter at home. Folks all well and hearty, eh?"</p>
               <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7199-00000050"/>
               <p>"Yes, mother is well, and so is Alice; and so were Uncle Ashley's folks when last
                  we heard from them. But, Jemmy, I'm fourteen years old to-day, and it's high time
                  that I ceased to be a burden to my mother. Alice maintains herself by sewing; but
                  here am I, a great lazy fellow of fourteen, without anything to do that will bring
                  me in a penny, or relieve my mother of the charge of supporting me. I ought to
                  maintain her now, not she me."</p>
               <p>"There's some truth in that, Master Gerald," thoughtfully observed the old
                  fisherman.</p>
               <p>"I'd go to sea, or go and seek my fortune somewhere or other, if mother would give
                  her consent," continued Gerald. "By George, I'm almost inclined to go away from
                  home secretly. Mother would forgive me, I know, when she came to know that my
                  object was to assist her and myself at the same time."</p>
               <p>"Not go away from home agin your mother's wish, Master Gerald?" said the old
                  man.</p>
               <p>"Why, what do women know as to what a man ought to do? and I ought to be a man
                  now," said the boy, impatiently. "It would be better for myself; better for
                  mother—and," he added, after a pause, "better for Alice."</p>
               <p>"Master Gerald," said the old man, gravely, "I'm sorry to hear you talk that a
                  ways. I never had a wife, or I should p'raps have been a better and a happier man.
                  I should have had a wife if I had followed the advice of my mother; but I was
                  headstrong, and went a long v'yage to sea agin her wish. <emph>She</emph> wished
                  me to stay in the coastin' trade and marry poor Jane, who's dead and gone years
                  and years ago. They heerd as I was lost, and Jane, agin <emph>her</emph> will,
                  poor thing, married somebody else. I came back, and she took it so much to heart
                  that she'd been and gone, and married a man as she didn't care for, while I was
                  living, that she broke her heart. I vowed arter that as I'd never marry, and I
                  didn't. But Gerald, take an old man's advice as has seen the world and is old
                  enough to be your grandfather. Never speak contemptuous of women. No man ever
                  spoke contemptuous of women without his havin' a bad heart as well as a bad head.
                  God made 'em to be our helpmates, boy. <emph>He</emph> made 'em to be man's
                  earthly support, his encouragement in trials, his comfort in sorrow and
                  affliction, his nurse in sickness, his earliest teacher, his last friend, his
                  mother, his sister, his wife. And without mother, sister or wife, what would man
                  be? Sister or wife, was luck, I never had; but I had a mother, boy, and if she war
                  alive now, or if I <emph>had</emph> been blessed with a wife or sister, mayhap
                  Jemmy Milton wouldn't be the poor unfortunit old vagabone he is now."</p>
               <p>The old man's voice had trembled with suppressed emotion as he spoke, and now, for
                  some minutes, he remained silent, and when he again spoke, it was to repeat his
                  voice of warning.</p>
               <p>"Master Gerald, whatever you do, don't go agin your mother."</p>
               <p>"Nor will I, Jemmy," replied the youth. "I never entertained such a thought; but I
                  wish I had some friend who could persuade mother that it were better for herself,
                  as well as for me, that I should be endeavoring now to make my own way in the
                  world."</p>
               <p>"Well, there is sense in that; there is sense in that," repeated the old
                  fisherman. "Suppose, now, you should get your uncle to speak to her. He's a clever
                  man, Mr. Ashley. I've a great opinion on him myself. S'pose you was to go over now
                  to Sandgate and ax him to come over to Herrington and give Mrs. Dalton a bit of
                  his mind."</p>
               <p>"I have thought of that, Jemmy," replied Gerald, "but I don't think Uncle Ashley
                  would be of much use; Cousin Frederick is as old as I am, and he's at home
                  yet."</p>
               <p>"Ay, to be sure, to be sure," returned the old man. "Still I've lived long enough
                  to know as two heads is wiser nor one. Mr. Ashley and your mother mought put their
                  heads together and summat mought come out o't."</p>
               <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7199-00000051"/>
               <p>"Well, then," said Gerald, "I will go over to Sandgate one day next week, and
                  speak to uncle."</p>
               <p>"And if nought comes, o' that, Gerald, you mought speak to Mr. Pearce, the parson,
                  up at the vicarage, you know, or to Dr. Knight. Both of 'em are real gentlemen,
                  and friends of your mother. I would speak to her myself, but the words of an old
                  wagabone like me wouldn't go for much."</p>
               <p>Gerald coincided with Jemmy's opinion as far as regarded the assertion that his
                  advice would not be such as his mother would be prone to listen to; not that he or
                  his mother thought the honest, eccentric old fisherman a vagabond, but anything
                  that Jemmy might suggest would, as Gerald well know, be of a nature to frighten
                  his mother into the belief that he was urging her son into just the reckless
                  course of adventure she wished him to avoid.</p>
               <p>"Now, I'm goin' to launch my boat, Gerald, boy, and examine the nets I laid last
                  night in the creek," said Jemmy, rising up and putting his tools in the locker.
                  "S'pose you lend me a hand, and mayhap, if I've luck, I'll give ye some fish to
                  take home."</p>
               <p>Nothing could have been more agreeable to Gerald than such a proposition as this.
                  He consented with alacrity, and for the present, the subject of conversation was
                  dropped.</p>

            <div type="chapter">

               <argument>
                  <p>In which it is shown that misfortune still presses upon Mr. Ashley; but he
                     meets with a friend in the hour of need, and goes to London. Showing further
                     now Gerald Dalton accompanied him thither.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MR. ASHLEY had not succeeded so well as he had anticipated in Sang little watering
                  place enough and during the summer season was tolerably well supplied with
                  visitors, and the visitors brought children with them; all this was very fine, but
                  the children came for pleasure and recreation as well as their parents, and did
                  not go to Mr. Ashley's school. With the exception of the few hotels and boarding
                  house keepers, the villagers were all fishermen, smugglers, coast guardsmen, or
                  petty shopkeepers, all of a class that did not care for the education of their
                  children, or if they did, could not afford to pay for it, while the children of
                  the aforesaid hotel and boarding-house keepers, were weekly boarders at Mr.
                  Clarke's school at Herrington. Mr. Ashley's success at Sandgate was limited to the
                  patronage of some half dozen of his former Herrington friends, who sent their
                  children as weekly boarders to Sandgate, and so got them educated for nothing, and
                  boarded for nothing into the bargain, since they paid for neither.</p>
               <p>Gerald Dalton walked our to his uncle Ashley's as he had intimated tot the old
                  fisherman, and after relating his troubles, asked Mr. Ashley's advice.</p>
               <p>"Upon my word, Gerald," was the reply, "I scarcely know what to advise. You are
                  right, quite right, not to wish, at<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7199-00000052"/>
                  your age, to be longer a burden to your mother; It is time, too, that Frederick
                  should be doing something for himself, and he is anxious to do something, poor
                  fellow! but I am utterly unable to do any thing for him."</p>
               <p>"Cousin Fred might help you, uncle, in the school," interposed Gerald, "I only
                  wish I could help my mother with her work."</p>
               <p>Mr. Ashley smiled mournfully.</p>
               <p>"The school, Gerald," he replied, "does not suffice to furnish me with employment:
                  but come, I am going, over to Herrington this afternoon to see Mr. pearce,
                  Supposed you walk over with me if you have rested yourself sufficiently, and ask
                  his advice. Mr. Pearce has often spoken favorably of you to me. He may suggest
                  something."</p>
               <p>Gerald willingly complied, and the uncle and nephew sat our together.</p>
               <p>The object of Mr. Ashley in calling upon the Vicar, was to hold further
                  conversation respecting a matter which had heretofore been discussed between
                  them.</p>
               <p>Ever since the former had resigned the pastoral care of Zion Chapel, he had
                  entertained a desire to unite himself with the Established Church; in fact his
                  ambition was to become a minister of that persuasion: but there stood in his path
                  an insurmountable barrier, he had not received a university education, and this
                  additional one, he had not family or church influence to aid him. Mr. Pearce,
                  however, desirous of assisting him as far as lay in his power, had exerted his
                  influence to obtain for him an appointment as chaplain to one of the colonies;
                  not, be it said, with much hope of success, for he was well aware of the
                  difficulties that interposed themselves in the way of his obtaining even this by
                  no means covetable preferment, even if he would succeed in getting ordained to
                  holy orders; but the vicar had written to one of his friends, who had spoken of
                  the matter to one of the bishops, and as soon as the vicar received the letter
                  notifying him of this, he had sent for Mr. Ashley to call at the parsonage house
                  at his earliest leisure.</p>
               <p>The few miles between Sandgate and Herrington being to pleasant walk along the
                  margin of the cliffs, were soon passed over, and within a couple of hours from
                  leaving Sandgate, Mr. Ashley and his nephew reached the vicarage.</p>
               <p>"I am glad to see you, Mr. Ashley," said the vicar, when his visitors were ushered
                  into his presence by the servant; and you too, Gerald. Pray be seated. Why, what a
                  tall boy you are growing. Do you go to school at Sandgate?"</p>
               <p>"No sir," replied Gerald; "I have been over to see uncle, and we walked back from
                  Sandgate together."</p>
               <p>"Well then, you will both need some refreshment after your walk, and then your
                  uncle and I will have a little talk together and meanwhile, you can go and amuse
                  yourself in the garden."</p>
               <p>Refreshments were ordered, and soon brought in, and a variety of common-place
                  subjects filled up the conversation until they had been partaken of, when Gerald
                  left the room, and Mr. Pearce at once broached the subject on account of which he
                  had send for Mr. Ashley.</p>
               <p>"How does the school succeed, Mr. Ashley?" he asked, by way of preliminary. "Any
                  prospect of an increase?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed, no sir," replied Mr. Ashley; "I shall be compelled to give it up. It is
                  unless endeavoring to carry it on longer. I find it impossible to make both ends
                  meet. In fact, I am getting unavoidably into debt, and my prospects grow every day
                  more gloomy."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to hear that, very sorry," said the kind-hearted vicar; "however, let
                  us talk of other matters. I have received a letter from a friend of mine, a member
                  of Parliament, who is acquainted with the Bishop of ——. He has interested himself,
                  through my representations in your behalf. A meeting is shortly to take place. Let
                  me see—this is Saturday—a meeting will be held this very day fortnight at Exeter
                  Hall in London, which will be attended by several of the dignified clergy, to take
                  into consideration the qualifications of the various candidates for the
                  appointment of chaplain to three or four gov<pb n="104-105"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000053"/> ernment establishments; one, the most eligible, I
                  mean as regards the climate, is in Newfoundland; the others are on the coast of
                  Africa. Your application, sent through me, will be taken into consideration among
                  the rest; but I do not wish to raise high expectations. Some of the candidates
                  have been already ordained, and others have not the impediments to contend with in
                  getting ordained that you will meet with. Still I should not like you to miss the
                  chance, and even if you should not succeed in this matter, there are several
                  schools to be organized by the government, to one of which, I think, in the event
                  of your failing in your principal object, you may succeed in getting an
                  appointment. But it will be necessary for you to be present to occasion. Can you
                  go up to London during the week after next?"</p>
               <p>"The school will be no hindrance," replied Mr. Ashley, "Since I shall close it
                  next Saturday; but"—he hesitated, and the vicar, suspecting the cause of his
                  hesitation, observed:—</p>
               <p>"You will excuse me, I know, Mr. Ashley, for speaking so freely; you would observe
                  that you have not founds sufficient to bear the expenses of the journey?"</p>
               <p>"You have surmised correctly." said Mr. Ashley, the color mounting to his
                  forehead.</p>
               <p>"And I have met the difficulty," continued the vicar. "There is a society in
                  London—you may have heard of it—the object of which is to afford relief to
                  gentlemen of your class who have unavoidably, and through no fault of their own,
                  fallen into poverty. I have obtained for you the sum of thirty pounds through the
                  friend of whom I have spoken, and do not think that in doing this your delicacy
                  has been wounded. Except to the committee appointed to examine into the merits of
                  the cases presented to them, your name and circumstances are unknown."</p>
               <p>Mr. Ashley grasped the worthy vicar's hand, and with tears in his eyes' thanked
                  him for his generous interference in his behalf.</p>
               <p>"Well, well, we will say no more about that," said the vicar. "I am only glad that
                  I have had the opportunity of serving you. I suppose, now, there will be nothing
                  to prevent you have from being at Exeter Hall at the time appointed for the
                  several candidates to meet?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing," returned Mr. Ashley.</p>
               <p>"Then we will say nothing further about the matter at present. By the way," he
                  added suddenly, with the object of changing the conversation, "I have quite
                  forgotten to ask after you family. How are Mrs. Ashley and children?"</p>
               <p>"They are all quite well at present, though my wife is still subject to frequent
                  attacks of illness," replied Mr. Ashley.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to hear that," returned the vicar. "Let me see, Frederick is the name
                  of your oldest boy; I have not seen him for some time; he must be about the age of
                  Gerald, is he not?"</p>
               <p>"Nearly the same age; both have passed their fourteenth year. It is time that
                  Frederick was learning some business. It is wrong for a man in my circumstances,
                  with a family like mine to support, to keep the boy at home so long; but what am I
                  to do?"</p>
               <p>"Very true—very true," said the vicar; "but if you go abroad, you would of course
                  like the body to go with you, and I have no doubt he will be either useful to you
                  there, or something eligible for him will offer itself. Here comes Gerald. What
                  does Mrs. Dalton intend to do with that lad? He is a fine intelligent little
                  fellow."</p>
               <p>"Poor woman," said Mr. Ashley, "she is in the same predicament with myself. She
                  does not know what to do with him; and the boy himself is anxious to be no longer
                  a burthen to her. He would soon settle the question himself if he could have his
                  own way; and, I believe, would go to sea, for he is an adventurous youth; but he
                  is his mother's only child, and she cannot bear the idea of his leaving her to
                  engage in such a perilous avocation. In fact, the boy walked our to Sandgate
                  to-day to advise with me upon the subject."</p>
               <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7199-00000054"/>
               <p>Gerald now entered the room, and the vicar, addressing him, said:—</p>
               <p>"So Gerald, your uncle tells me you want to be doing something for yourself,
                  eh?"</p>
               <p>"Yes sir," replied the boy. "If I were in America, I know I should find plenty to
                  do, young as I am."</p>
               <p>"You are an American by birth, I believe?" said the vicar.</p>
               <p>"Yes sir," answered the boy, proudly, "I am a citizen of the United States;
                  leastwise, I shall be when I'm twenty-one. I shall go to America then."</p>
               <p>The clergy man smiled. "You show, at all events, that you have within you
                  something of the independence of spirit that I have heard attributed to your
                  countrymen," he said. "Your father died in America; did he not?"</p>
               <p>"Yes sir."</p>
               <p>"Yes, poor fellow!" interposed Mr. Ashley, "he did not find there the El Dorado he
                  had pictured before he left England."</p>
               <p>"I know the reason of that," said the boy; "I have heard my mother speak of it.
                  But I should act differently. My father was not educated as I have been."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you are right, Gerald," answered Mr. Ashley.</p>
               <p>"I have not doubt that he is," said the vicar; "but tell me Gerald, what would you
                  do if you had your own way?"</p>
               <p>"Anything that is honest, that would enable me to earn my own living and assist my
                  mother, sir."</p>
               <p>"Bravely answered, my good boy. Always adhere to that resolve—'Anything that is
                  honest.' But what business or profession would you prefer?"</p>
               <p>"I should like to go to sea, very well; but better still to travel in foreign
                  countries; to go all over the world," replied Gerald.</p>
               <p>"Rather an ambitious desire, my boy," said the clergyman, smiling at the reply;
                  "but what does your mother think is best adapted for you?"</p>
               <p>"She would like me to learn to be an engraver, if she had money enough to
                  apprentice me," said the boy. "I should like that pretty well myself, for I like
                  drawing."</p>
               <p>"Would you like to be employed at a picture-dealer's, in London?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! very much! I should so like to go to London, sir."</p>
               <p>"And your mother, would she be willing to let you go to London?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes sir, I am sure she would, if she had means to send me there."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, when you go home to-night, tell her that I will call into see her
                  to-morrow, and we'll talk the matter over. I have a friend in London, a
                  picture-dealer, who, I think, would take you into his employ upon my
                  recommendation. And as to the means of getting there, we'll try and manage
                  that."</p>
               <p>Gerald thanked the clergyman, and soon afterwards his uncle and he wished him
                  good-night, and quitted the vicarage. Mr. Ashley returned home to his family,
                  building <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chateaux en Espagne</foreign> to which he was too
                  much addicted, and already having succeeded, in imagination, in the realization of
                  his hopes; while Gerald was overjoyed at the prospect of getting a situation, and
                  of going to London.</p>
               <p>On the following morning Mr. Pearce called upon the widow—who had already been
                  informed by her son of the topic of conversation between him and the vicar the
                  previous evening and although she was sorrowful at the thought of separation from
                  her boy, as is natural to all mothers, she was grateful to the worthy clergyman
                  for the interest he had taken in her behalf. Mr. Pearce had brought Doctor Knight
                  with him, and after it had been settled that Gerald should go to London, he
                  said:</p>
               <p>"And now, Gerald, I promised you a Christmas box, which I have not yet given you.
                  Here are two sovereigns; they will pay your fare to London, and leave you some
                  pocket money besides. I only hope that you will make a proper use<pb n="108-109"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000055"/> of it, and that you will strive to give
                  satisfaction to your employer."</p>
               <p>"And I will add another sovereign," said the doctor, presenting the boy with the
                  coin.</p>
               <p>Gerald proudly pocketed the coins and returned his thanks to the donor, while the
                  widow was profuse in her expressions of gratitude.</p>
               <p>"Now," said the vicar, "your uncle, Mr. Ashley, intends to visit London in the
                  course of a fortnight. Do you think you can get ready in time to accompany him?
                  Let us hear what your mother says."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dalton thought she could make all necessary preparations by the time
                  specified, and expressed herself to that effect, and shortly afterwards the two
                  gentlemen took leave.</p>
               <p>It was a pretty hard task for the widow to prepare for her son's approaching
                  departure, for though it had been her pleasure and her pride, restricted as were
                  her means, to clothe his respectably at all times, he necessarily required many
                  new garments, which her funds were little able to supply. Nevertheless, by dint of
                  economizing and setting aside for the time being the anticipated purchase of
                  various articles she had intended to have procured for herself, and aided by Alice
                  Thornton, in carefully repairing and alternating old garments, she managed to make
                  up for her boy a respectable wardrobe, or at least to provide him with sufficient
                  clothing to serve him for some months. Perhaps it was well that her time was fully
                  occupied in this employment. Had she been idle, she might have felt more deeply
                  her son's approaching departure. Thus it is that what we consider our misfortune
                  often proves our greatest blessing. And as to Gerald, like most boys of his age
                  about to leave home for the first time, his mind was too much occupied with
                  hopeful anticipations of the future, to allow of its lodging much regret for the
                  present, much as he was attached to his mother.</p>
               <p>The day previous to that on which he was to leave home, he again met Jemmy Milton
                  on the beach. Gerald and Alice had walked out together, leaving Mrs. Dalton to
                  pack up her son's clothing. The widow had desired them so to do. she wished to be
                  for a few hours, on this last day, alone with her own thoughts, to collect her
                  mind, and to think over a thousand things that she wished to speak of when she and
                  Gerald should be alone that last evening at home—and perhaps to pray that her
                  fatherless boy might be protected and guided, now that he was going forth into the
                  world, by Him who has promised to be a father to the orphan, and a husband to the
                  widow.</p>
               <p>Gerald and Alice were in serious conversation when they saw the old fisherman. It
                  was the first time that they, young children as they were, had held serious
                  conversation together.</p>
               <p>The old man came out of his favorite retreat, the boat-house, to meet them.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Master Gerald," he said, "What's this I hear? So you are going away to
                  Lunnun?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Jemmy," replied the boy, "I was coming with Alice, here, to tell you. I
                  did'nt know that you were aware of it."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes," said the old man; "old Jemmy hears everything that's going on; but what
                  be going to do in Lunnun, Master Gerald? It's an awful place for a youngster to
                  drift into."</p>
               <p>"I hardly know myself," replied Gerald. "I am going to a friend of Mr. Pearce's,
                  who has promised, through his recommendation, to take me in his employ. He is a
                  picture-dealer, or something of that sort, I believe."</p>
               <p>"Ha! a picture-dealer. Well, no doubt if so be as Mr. Pearce got you the berth,
                  it's all right; though for the matter o' that, I've heered as paintin's a mighty
                  onsartain trade; but you allers had a notion of paintin', I will say that. Do you
                  recollect the beautiful pictur' of the Herrington hoy—agoin' spankin' down
                  channel—colored, too, like natur."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Alice, laughing, "he showed me that picture; the hull was of a sky
                  blue color, and the sails yellow, and braced different ways, while the position of
                  the red vane showed that she was sailing with a square foresail, right against the
                  wind."</p>
               <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7199-00000056"/>
               <p>"For all that it was a real handsome pictur'," said the old man, "and I've got it
                  at home pasted up over the chimbly-piece ever since. Master Gerald explained as
                  how it was done in perspective, as he called it, and that was how the cutter came
                  to be sailin' agin the wind."</p>
               <p>"Never mind my picture," said Gerald, laughing, yet seemingly a trifle annoyed at
                  Alice's criticism, "and as to my talent for painting, I don't suppose it would be
                  called into request at a picture-dealer, even if I possessed any talent of that
                  kind."</p>
               <p>"Well, come and sit down, both of ye, in the old boat-house," said the old man.
                  "Mayhap it will be a long time before we meet here again; but I shall think of you
                  often, and, haply, you won't forget Jemmy Milton?"</p>
               <p>"I hope not," said Gerald. "You and I have always been good friends. As soon as I
                  get any money I shall send you something from London to remember me by."</p>
               <p>"Don't trouble yourself about that, Master Gerald," said the old fisherman, "but
                  think of your mother, boy, and send her all the money you can spare; that will be
                  the best way for you to get rid on it. Miss Alice won't forget you, nuther, I
                  warrant—will you, Miss?"</p>
               <p>Alice did not reply; she looked serious and thoughtful; the arch merriment which
                  had led her to criticise Gerald's vaunted picture of the cutter, had vanished, and
                  she was evidently grieved at the idea of parting from him.</p>
               <p>They were now seated on the bench in the boat-house, and Jemmy had lighted his
                  pipe, after having taken a drink from a mug of beer which stood on a rude table
                  near him.</p>
               <p>"Lunnun's a wonderful place," said he, after having smoked for a short time in
                  silence. "I have been there myself, though I didn't go much into the city 'cept
                  over to St. Paul's and once to the moniment. I spent most of my time there in
                  Radcliffe Highway and Wapping. There's heaps of bad company and curious company in
                  Lunnun, boy—heaps on 'em. You'll be tempted to drink. Take an old man's advice,
                  and don't give way to drink," and the old man took another swig at the beer as he
                  spoke. "Drink is the ruin of half the young men;" he continued; "don't get the
                  taste of it, boy. I once fell into a pot o' beer, and I took to drink arterwards,
                  and never did no good for myself."</p>
               <p>"You once fell into a pot of beer!" cried Gerald, as he and Alice looked at the
                  old man with astonishment. Gerald was used to Jemmy's marvellous stories, but this
                  assertion eclipsed all he had heard.</p>
               <p>"Aye, but I wasn't so stout at that time as I am now," said the old man,
                  thoughtfully.</p>
               <p>"I should think not," said Gerald, laughing, as he scanned the burly proportions
                  of the old fisherman. "You would have some trouble to get into a beer barrel
                  now."</p>
               <p>"For all that, boy, laugh as you may, I once fell headforemost into a pot o'beer,
                  and this is how it came about. D'ye see, I was then a youngster much about your
                  age. It was my third v'yage to sea. We were bound from Liverpool to Australy, and
                  the ship was a crossing the Indian Ocean, when thick weather came on, and the
                  skipper couldn't take an observation of the sun for a whole week. We had lost our
                  reckoning and didn't know where we were adriftin' to. By-and-by it came on to blow
                  great guns—the hardest gale ever I see, and I have seen and weathered many on 'em.
                  For three days we tossed about, losing all our sails and springing all our spars,
                  every moment expectin' to go down to Davy Jones' locker. The bulwarks were gone
                  and so were the boats, and every-thing that the sea could sweep from the decks,
                  and still there seemed no sign of the gale's abatin'. At last there came a lull,
                  and then suddenly the wind chopped round and blowed ten times harder than ever
                  from the opposite quarter. The ship came up in the wind, broached to and careened
                  over on her beam ends. The skipper shouted to cut away the masts; but he'd hardly
                  got the words out of his mouth when a terrible sea burst over the deck and swept
                  ever living being from the wreck. Down, down, I<pb n="112-113"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000057"/> went, fathoms deep into the dark water. I soon lost
                  all consciousness, for I don't recollect rising to the surface, but when I came to
                  I found myself floating on a spare mizzen topmast spar, to which I was clinging
                  might and main. Nothing of the wreck was to be seen, 'cept here and there a broken
                  spar tossing madly up and down upon the water. The gale, howsomever, had spent
                  itself, and the wind begun to grow less violent, thought the sea was still so
                  rough that I had enough to do to hold on to the spar. Night came on, and with it
                  no hope of relief. I gave myself up for lost, but all that long, dreary night I
                  clung like grim death to the spar. At last daylight came. It was nearly calm, and
                  the sea was much smoother. I looked around in hopes of seeing some of my
                  shipmates; but nothing, now, not even a piece of wreck was to be seen. I strained
                  my eyes into the horizon in hopes of seeing land, and at last I thought I did see
                  a speck in the distance, which might be land, or might be only a cloud. I fixed my
                  gaze upon it, and as the sun rose higher in the horizon, I discovered, to my great
                  joy, that it was land, and in another hour I found that I was slowly drifting
                  towards it. By noon I had got so close to it that I could distinguish the outline
                  of the shore and of the division in the mountain range that formed the
                  back-ground. The current now begun to set in rapidly, and I drifted nearer at the
                  rate of three knots an hour, at least, and by night-fall the spar to which I was
                  clinging drifted on shore. I was so weak that I could scarcely disengage myself
                  from it, and I was sorely bruised as it jerked me to and fro on the beach; but at
                  last I got clear, and crawled up high beyond the beach, and took shelter under a
                  strange tree, which was for all the world like a weed, with its green stem and its
                  broad leaf on the top; but it was full twenty feet high, and the leaf lopped down
                  almost to the ground, and made a very comfortable shade. I was wet and hungry, but
                  withal so fatigued that I soon fell asleep. When I woke, the sun was again high in
                  the heavens, my clothes had dried upon me, and the warmth of the sun was very
                  agreeable but my limbs were so stiff that I could hardly move. I made shift,
                  however, to crawl about and look for something to eat. For a long time I was
                  unsuccessful, though as my limbs grew less stiff from exercise, I must have
                  wandered several miles into the country. What amazed me was to see how big the
                  trees were—a thousand times as tall as that which I had slept under during the
                  night, which was only a mere plant in comparison. They were so lofty that I could
                  scarcely distinguish the uppermost branches. I saw a lot of large round bodies
                  lying about under one of those monstrous trees, of the shape and color of nuts,
                  buts big enough to lodge half a dozen men inside. Presently a monstrous animal,
                  shaped like a squirrel, came bounding past me with one of these large round things
                  in his mouth. He saw me, and seemed to be frightened of me, little as I was
                  compared with him, for he dropped the thing he had in his mouth, and scrambled up
                  one of the monstrous trees. I was so desperately hungry that I dared risk
                  anything, and I walked up and examined the thing he had let fall from his mouth.
                  Sure enough it was a nut which he had cracked, and there was meat enough inside to
                  serve a dozen men for a week. I soon eat a hole in it big enough to effect a
                  lodging, and there I staid for a week, making the nut-shell serve me for my
                  lodging, while the kernel supplied me with food. Water I had in plenty, for
                  several large rivers, as I thought, flowed in every direction around me. I
                  afterwards learnt that they were streamlets, created by the drops of water which
                  trickled from some rocks near by.</p>
               <p>"One day, while I was still lost in amazement at all I saw in this strange
                  country, I saw a great thing in the shape of a man, but as big as a mountain,
                  coming towards me. I was frightened, and crept into my nut-shell, which by this
                  time was getting pretty hollow, for I had consumed the greater portion of the
                  meat. On he came, however, so close that I feared his next step would crush the
                  nut-shell and me with it into atoms.</p>
               <p>"I made a desperate spring to avoid the threatened danger,<pb n="114-115"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000058"/> and 'lighted on his foot, from which I crawled up
                  to his stocking. He wore knee breeches, and I clung easily to the stockings, which
                  were made of stuff like worsted, but as coarse as a cable, and the strands as far
                  apart as the ratlins of a ship's rigging. I was afraid of being shook off as he
                  walked, so I crawled and crawled up until I got hold of the tail of his coat and
                  at last I slid down into one of his pockets, where I lay pretty comfortable, but
                  dreadfully frightened. Away he walked with me, making tremendous stride at every
                  step till I could hear him talking in a voice like thunder to some other person
                  who was speaking quite as loud. I guessed by this that he had got home, and
                  think's I to myself—"Jemmy Milton, my lad, you've got into a fix. S'pose this here
                  mountain should take it into his head to sit down. He'd squash you like a pumpkin.
                  So I crawls up out of the pocket, mounts up his back to his shoulder, and without
                  his observing me, slides down his arm and hides myself in the big cuff of his
                  sleeve. By and by he calls for a pot of beer——"</p>
               <p>"Did he speak English, Jemmy?" said Gerald.</p>
               <p>"To be sure he did," replied the old man. "What other lingo would you have him
                  speak?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know," said Gerald, "only I thought it odd that English should be spoken
                  so far away from England."</p>
               <p>"Don't they speak English in Ameriky, where you were born?" said Jemmy. "Everybody
                  speaks English but Injun savages, and them outlandish Frenchmen; and they'd speak
                  English if they could, but they ain't got savey enough."</p>
               <p>"Go on with your story, Mr. Milton," said Alice, "never mind Gerald."</p>
               <p>"I will, Miss, but Master Gerald, you mustn't interrupt me again with sich silly
                  question. As I was a sayin' he roars out for a pot o' beer, and it was set on the
                  table afore him. He stretched out his hand to take hold of it to take a drink and
                  jerks me right out of his sleeve and I falls plump, head foremost right into the
                  pot.</p>
               <p>"You may be sure I made a splutter. I'd narrowly escaped being drowned in salt
                  water, and I didn't fancy being drowned and suffocated besides in a pot o'
                  beer.</p>
               <p>"He heard me a struggling and splashing and down he puts the pot and raps out a
                  big oath, crying out what on earth's this here in the beer—a pesky cockroach, I do
                  believe. Sally, says he, you've left the bung out of the barrel.</p>
               <p>"No I ain't, father," says another voice, not quite so loud as the old man's, and
                  a mighty deal softer and puttier, and when I heard it I know'd as it was Sally as
                  spoke, and that Sally was the old chap's daughter.</p>
               <p>"He puts his finger into the beer, and draws me out, and when he and Sally seed
                  what I was, my eyes! you should have heerd the screaches of surprise they
                  give.</p>
               <p>"Why, I declare, it's a little man, father!" says she.</p>
               <p>"By George, so it is," says the old man. "Where in the world can he have come
                  from?"</p>
               <p>"I came from England," says I, shaking myself and spluttering, for I was half
                  choked with the beer.</p>
               <p>"And where th——'s England?" says the old man, swearing an oath which I won't
                  repeat.</p>
               <p>"Yes, where's England," says the girl, "I never heerd tell of it in my jography."
                  So I up and told 'em where England was, and how I had got shipwrecked and had
                  drifted ashore on a log, a lived a week in a nutshell, and the old man told Sally
                  to call her mother, and then I had to tell my story over again, and then strangers
                  came in and I told Sally to call her mother, and then I had to tell my story over
                  again, and then strangers came in and I told it again and again every so many
                  times, and they wanted to know all about the countries where the little people
                  lived, and I told them all I knew; but they didn't believe me, I know. They said
                  as I was a <foreign xml:lang="LAT">lusus natural,</foreign> or summat like that,
                  but I wouldn't deny my country and I stuck to it that I was an Englishman. Well I
                  lived there a year or more and saw many strange sights, and might have lived there
                  till now; but I had built me a little boat, just big enough for me to manage
                  cleverly. And I used<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7199-00000059"/> to go out to sea
                  in it for my own amusement, and one day when I was out fishing for shrimps, which
                  were about as big as a large salmon, a gale of wind came on, and I blown off the
                  shore, and should have starved to death, but two days afterwards a ship hove in
                  sight, and they saw my signal and bore down to me and took me aboard. I told them
                  all about the strange country I had lived in, and the big men and women, but they
                  wouldn't believe me. Howsomever <emph>I</emph> couldn't help that, and I didn't
                  care. The ship was homeward bound from China, and I came to England on board of
                  her, and landed at Bristol. I never met with any body since as had been in that
                  country, but I once read of a skipper named Gulliver, or some sich name, who had
                  been cast away on an island where the people was monstrous big, and I ain't got no
                  doubt as it was the same place."</p>
               <p>"Have you no idea whereabouts in the world that country lies," said Alice.</p>
               <p>"No, Miss, not in the least. We was shipwrecked in the Injun Seas, but the ship
                  had been blown leagues out of the regular track of navigation."</p>
               <p>"I never read of such a country in geography, nor heard of its being laid down in
                  any chart," said Alice, demurely, pretending to believe the old man's yarn.</p>
               <p>"Nor I, Miss," he replied; "but jographys aint always to be trusted to, and charts
                  is very imperfect; but I got a liking for beer through that accident, and what I
                  wants to pint out is, that it's dangerous to take the first taste of strong drink;
                  you mayn't like it at first no more nor I did when I fell into the pot of beer,
                  but you gets into the habit of drinking it, and it sticks to you through life:
                  there's the moral of my story."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Gerald, "I am glad you have enlightened me in regard to that, for I
                  should never have discovered otherwise that your yarn had a moral."</p>
               <p>"It has, and a right good one too," said the old fisherman; and then he added
                  abruptly: "When do you go up to Lunnun, Master Gerald?"</p>
               <p>"To-morrow, Jemmy," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"What, so soon?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and that Alice and I must be going home. So I shall wish you good-bye,
                  Jemmy. I shall write to Alice, and she will sometimes read part of the letters to
                  you. You will see that I shall not forget you."</p>
               <p>"Are you a going to take a cat with you to Lunnun?" asked the old man.</p>
               <p>"A cat! for what?" said Gerald.</p>
               <p>"Because I read once in a history that a poor boy went to Lunnun, and all the
                  wealth he had was a cat, and he came to be rich through that cat, and to be thrice
                  Lord Mayor of Lunnun."</p>
               <p>"Whittington, you mean," said Alice.</p>
               <p>"Aye, Whittington; that was the name. He heard Bow Bells say:— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Turn agin Whittington,</l>
                        <l>Thrice Lord Mayor of Lunnun."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> "You take my advice, Master Gerald, and when you hear them ere Bow bells, you
                  say, 'Turn agin Whittington, thrice Lord Mayor of Lunnun.' Mayhap then you will
                  come to be Lord Mayor yourself—same as Whittington did."</p>
               <p>"I hope such good luck will befall me," said Gerald, laughing, "but I fear not.
                  However, Jemmy, I shall recollect your advice."</p>
               <p>"Do boy, do" said the old man as he shook the youth's hand. "You start by the
                  coach to-morrow, you say? I shall be at the coach-office to see you off. Good-bye,
                  and God bless you."</p>
               <p>Alice and Gerald walked slowly homewards, talking earnestly together. Now for the
                  first time they felt the full force of the attachment they bore each other, now
                  when they were about to part for a long time—perhaps forever. So it is with us
                  all. We seldom feel the real value of a friend, even the full strength of the love
                  we bear to those closer and dearer<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7199-00000060"/> than
                  mere friends, till fortune bids up part from them. They exacted many promises from
                  each other, and agreed to write by every opportunity; but in those days postage
                  was expensive—far beyond their means to pay—and they could not hope that their
                  correspondence would be very frequent.</p>
               <p>That last evening at home, Gerald spent in private with his mother; even Alice was
                  not permitted to intrude upon that privacy. Nor will I attempt to penetrate into
                  it. A mother's parting with an only son, and that mother a widow, is of too sacred
                  a nature to be rashly intruded upon or lightly spoken of. It was late—very late,
                  for beyond Mrs. Dalton's usual hour of retiring to rest, when she and Gerald
                  retired to their own rooms that night.</p>
               <p>The family was up betimes in the morning, for the coach started at nine o'clock,
                  and Mr. Ashley was to call for his nephew at eight o'clock. They were seated at
                  the breakfast table when he came; but little had been partaken of by any one; Mrs.
                  Dalton and Alice, and even Gerald himself, were each and all too low-spirited to
                  eat much that morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ashley was invited to join them at the table, but he said that he had
                  breakfasted with his family before leaving Sandgate, and as they had some distance
                  to walk to the coach-office, it was time they were starting.</p>
               <p>Gerald was quite ready, and his mother and Alice said they would accompany him to
                  the office.</p>
               <p>The coach was nearly ready to start when they arrived. It was as well. It is
                  always better to allow of short time for leave-taking. Jemmy Milton was waiting
                  also to bid his young friend farewell and see him off. He held a small parcel in
                  his hand, and as they approached, he came forward to meet them.</p>
               <p>"Good morning, Ma'am," he said to Mrs. Dalton. "So Master Gerald's off to Lunnun
                  to seek his fortune; well, let's hope it'll be a happy one; nothing like hoping,
                  Ma'am; the man as tries and hopes, and if he fails, tries and hopes agin, is the
                  man to get forard in the world, whether by sea or land; and Master Gerald's one of
                  that sort, or I'm much mistaken. I've brought a trifling gift for you, Gerald,
                  lad. It aint much, but something as may be useful and sarve to make you remember
                  the old man by. Arter you was gone, Yesterday, from the old boat-house—you'll
                  remember the old boat-house, Master Gerald—I casts about to think what I could
                  give you for a keepsake, and as last, arter thinking first of one thing and then
                  of another, I hits upon a ditty nag; here it be; it's one as I used to keep for
                  extraordinary occasions when I followed the sea. Thinks I, that there ditty nag's
                  jist the thing for Master Gerald, now he's a going away from home; if it aint
                  ornamental, it's useful. See here; it's well stocked with sail needles and tarred
                  twine, and a palm and every thing useful; and besides them, I've put in a
                  marling-spike and a fid, as I made myself out of a bit of fancy wood I picked up
                  while on a voyage to the South Seas. When you set to work to use this here ditty
                  bag, Gerald my boy, you'll think of the old sailor now laid up in ordinary like
                  the old commodore as the song says: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"The bullet and the gout</l>
                        <l>Had so knocked his hull about,</l>
                        <l>That he never more was fir for sea."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Gerald thanked the honest old man, and received the to him useless gift, but it
                  was all Jemmy possessed to show his good will.</p>
               <p>And now the coachman came out of the hotel, the guard requested the passengers to
                  take their seats, and he and the coachman mounted to their places. There were
                  hurried words, and earnest looks of affection, and tearful eyes. The guard
                  shouted, "All right." The coachman smacked his whip, and the well groomed,
                  impatient horses sprang forward eagerly, glad to find themselves in motion. The
                  coach rattled over the pebbled street, and the passers by looked up with
                  admiration as it dashed proudly along, while from the uplifted windows<pb
                     n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7199-00000061"/> of many a house, salutations and smiles
                  were interchanged between the smart servant maids and the coachman and guards, and
                  soon the rumbling of the wheels and the sound of the horses' hoofs grew more and
                  more indistinct as the coach passed from the rough pavement on to the smooth
                  country road. Another minute, and it was out of sight, and the hoofs of the
                  prancing steeds and the rumbling of the wheels was heard no longer, and a
                  sorrowful group that had waited in the street gazing after the coach with
                  straining and tearful eyes to the last moment, turned away, and departed slowly
                  and thoughtfully, and tearfully homeward.</p>

                  <p>The journey to London, and what befel Mr. Ashley and Gerald in the great
                     metropolis.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MERRILY the coach proceeded on its way when the smooth, level high-road was gained
                  and the cobble-stones of dirty, gloomy Herrington were left behind. Away she went,
                  borne onward by four spanking chestnuts, which seemed to enjoy equally with the
                  coachman, the speed at which they were driven. The high road for several miles
                  skirted the cliffs, affording a glorious view of the channel, the water glistening
                  like molten silver in the bright rays of the morning sun, and the numerous vessels
                  that dotted its surface looking from the heights like toy boats in a miniature
                  sea. The guard sounded his bugle in a cheerful tune, for it was truly inspiriting,
                  that rapid drive, in the early morning, and the coachman whistled an accompaniment
                  to the music. Shakespeare's cliff was just visible in the distance, and some of
                  the passengers, for the coach was loaded outside, discoursed in learned criticism
                  on the crag, made immortal by the genius of the poet, and before long, Gerald, who
                  had felt somewhat low-spirited when Herrington had faded in the distance, soon
                  recovered the cheerfulness natural to boyhood under almost any circumstances.</p>
               <p>It was a novelty to him—a glorious novelty—this rapid travel on the top of a
                  stage-coach. Often, when he had watched it pass him on the road—this very stage—he
                  had envied the passengers seated on the roof, and thought that he would sooner
                  have occupied a position there than have been seated on a<pb n="122-123"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000062"/> throne; and the coachman, so spruce in his attire,
                  so conscious of power, as he held the reins, and guided the movements of the
                  spirited steed—he had often thought a stage-coachman's life, careless, jovial, and
                  free, must be the happiest in the world. And now he was seated behind the
                  coachman, and in his turn looking with conscious pride upon the slowly traveling
                  pedestrians as they passed on their way. Herrington was behind him, and he had
                  parted from his mother and from Alice for the first time, perhaps for a very, very
                  long time; but London, mighty London, with its mysterious wealth and grandeur, was
                  before him, and the sorrows of the past hour were already forgotten in the bright
                  anticipations of the future. How he admired the beautiful scenery; the stage was
                  passing so rapidly that the trees and hedges and farm-houses and barns seemed to
                  be flying from them. It was a glorious living panorama. Seen and enjoyed for the
                  first time, it was a pleasure to be remembered for a lifetime. Oh! how different
                  from the still more rapid, but far less exhilarating travel by rail, in these more
                  utilitarian days. We cannot deny that we have gained much by the progress of
                  science and the inventions of more modern times, but we have lost not a little,
                  too.</p>
               <p>Willingly would Gerald have entered into conversation with his uncle, who was
                  seated beside him on the front seat behind the box, but Mr. Ashley was in little
                  mood to converse, and short answers were all he could obtain in reply to his
                  questions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ashley had enough think of. Under happier auspices he might, and doubtless
                  would, have enjoyed the scenery through which he was passing, although, perhaps,
                  net with the fresh, boyish delight of his nephew; but he was thinking of the
                  ordeal that he had to undergo on his arrival in London, and of his dreary
                  prospects at home; and of the success that might visit him in the future, and of
                  the awful presence of the bishop, before whom he might be called to speak, and
                  alternately hoping, and doubting, and fearing, he had little inclination to go
                  into extacies over the, even to him, unwonted excitement of a stage-coach
                  ride.</p>
               <p>At Canterbury, the gentleman who had occupied the box-seat beside the coachman,
                  from Herrington, alighted, and when the stage had changed horses and again started
                  on its journey, the coachman sat alone in the post of honor.</p>
               <p>He was a happy, jovial, kind-hearted fellow, as were all stage-coachmen of the
                  race gone-by, and he had noticed the bright, intelligent countenance of the lad,
                  and in the absence of a better faze he thought the boy might as well occupy the
                  vacant seat by his side; so, after proceeding a mile or two, he leaned back, and
                  addressing Gerald, said:</p>
               <p>"You seem lonesome, like, young gentleman: p'raps you'd like to come and sit aside
                  of me; if, so, crawl over and take the box seat and welcome."</p>
               <p>Gerald looked at his uncle, as if to ask permission, and observing in his
                  countenance no sign of disapproval, he lost no time in accepting the proffered
                  invitation, and was soon busily occupied in conversation with the coachman.</p>
               <p>"And so you are going to London?" said this functionary, after the youth had been
                  for a few minutes seated by his side.</p>
               <p>"Yes," answered Gerald.</p>
               <p>"For the first time?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," again.</p>
               <p>"On a visit, maybe; have friends there?"</p>
               <p>"Not exactly on a visit." said Gerald.</p>
               <p>"On business then; though a young gentleman like you can hardly be going up to
                  London on business. Going to school, p'raps?"</p>
               <p>"No," said Gerald, "I am not going to school."</p>
               <p>"To be sure not. I might ha' knowed that," said the coachman; "boys don't go to
                  London to school. Going home from school?"</p>
               <p>"Nor going home from school, neither," replied Gerald, "I'm going to a situation
                  in London."</p>
               <p>"Going to a situation in London, eh? Going to begin the world on your own account.
                  Well, I've taken many youngsters<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7199-00000063"/> sters
                  up to London in my time who was going to begin the world on their own account, and
                  I've brought some of 'em back again after years had passed. Some on 'em have done
                  well, some havn't. If it wouldn't be rude, I'd ask what situation you was going
                  to?"</p>
               <p>"I have no objections to tell you," said Gerald. "I'm going to a picture dealer's,
                  in a place they call Bloomsbury, in London."</p>
               <p>"I know the place," returned the coachman. "A nice place enough. A good deal of
                  business done in Bloomsbury. Pictur'-dealer's I should think a very good trade,
                  too. Gent behind, your father?"</p>
               <p>"My uncle," said Gerald.</p>
               <p>"Seems down in the mouth," observed the coachman, giving a cautions glance
                  behind.</p>
               <p>"He's going to London on important business," said Gerald; "that, perhaps, makes
                  him more thoughtful than usual."</p>
               <p>"Where do you intend to put up in London?" asked the coachman.</p>
               <p>"I' m sure I can't say," said Gerald; "wherever the coach stops, I suppose."</p>
               <p>"The coach stops at the Blue Boar, Holborn. Capital inn Can't do better than put
                  up there," said the coachman. "I always stay there myself—good grub and capital
                  ale they keep."</p>
               <p>The conversation, after this introduction of queries and replies—the coachman's
                  curiosity being, apparently, satisfied—grew more general, although Gerald, of his
                  own free will, related his history from his earliest recollections, and launched
                  out into the expression of several hopeful anticipations for the future. And the
                  coachman, in return for this confidence, pointed out the various gentlemen's seats
                  they passed on their journey, and related the history of their families, in which
                  he appeared to be perfectly well posted.</p>
               <p>"So you was born in Ameriky?" said he, after some time.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Gerald.</p>
               <p>"Great country, that, I've heard: you don't remember, much of it, though?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, I do," said Gerald, "I was eight years old when I left, you know. I hope
                  to return there some day."</p>
               <p>"I've heard of many that have done well there," said the coachman. "Provided I was
                  out of a place here, I don't know that I shouldn't like to go America myself. I do
                  hear talk of some new fangled notions of doing away with the pike roads and
                  driving carriages by steam. I don't believe none of it, the thing's impossible;
                  but if it should be the case, coachmen and hosses 'd be used up, and guards, too,
                  for the matter of that; but I hope they'll last my time, at any rate."</p>
               <p>From this subject the conversation diverged upon America, and the coachman was
                  very curious in learning from Gerald all he knew or could recollect having seen of
                  the land of his birth, and by the time they reached Milton, where they stopped to
                  dine, they were as well acquainted and as friendly as if they had known each other
                  for years.</p>
               <p>On leaving Milton, a passenger paid the extra fare for the box seat, and Gerald,
                  of course, though to the mutual regret of himself and his new friend, was
                  compelled to resume his seat beside his uncle.</p>
               <p>It was but a journey of seventy-two miles from Herrington to London, and the stage
                  reached the metropolis at a tolerably early hour in the evening, and as Gerald had
                  been informed, stopped at the yard of the Blue Boar Inn, where his uncle and he
                  proposed to stay for the night, and after a comfortable supper they both retired
                  to rest.</p>
               <p>Both lay for a long time awake, though their mutual wakefulness was owing to very
                  different causes. Mr. Ashley was nervously anticipating the visit to Exeter Hall
                  on the following day. Gerald although somewhat curious regarding his future
                  employer, and anxious to know what duties he would be required to perform, was
                  mainly occupied in anticipating the expected marvels that were to greet his vision
                  on the<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7199-00000064"/> following morning, when London
                  would be revealed to him in all its glory. It was dusk when the coach reached the
                  great metropolis that evening, and he had had but an indistinct view of crowds of
                  people, hurrying to and fro, and brilliantly lighted shops, which the coach had
                  rattled past so swiftly that his curiosity was only whetted instead of being
                  gratified. He thought, too, of his mother, and Alice, and wondered whether they
                  were thinking of him, and how long it would be before he should see them again,
                  and then his heart became sad, and his spirits sunk; but these were but fleeting
                  regrets, and again and again, with all the buoyancy of youth, his thoughts
                  reverted to the anticipated pleasures of the morrow.</p>
               <p>At length both he and his uncle fell asleep, and slept so soundly after the
                  unaccustomed fatigues of the day, that it was a late hour in the morning before
                  either awoke, so late in fact, that Mr. Ashley was obliged to hurry through his
                  breakfast in order to prepare himself to attend the meeting at Exeter Hall, and to
                  forego the idea of accompanying his nephew to Bloomsbury as had been his
                  intention, and Gerald, after packing up a change of clothing in a bundle which he
                  carried under his arm (leaving his trunk at the hotel to be sent after him) set
                  forth to search out his new home. He had the directions on a card—"MR. HOFFMANN,
                  PICTURE DEALER, AUCTIONEER, AND GENERAL AGENT.BROAD ST, BLOOMSBURY." He believed
                  that he should have no difficulty in finding the place, and if he should meet with
                  any, he would only, in his wanderings, see more of London. But a change had come
                  over the face of the city since a few hours before, when on rising from his bed he
                  had run to the window and looked into the streets. Then, although the sun was not
                  shining very brightly, the morning was clear and crowds of people were hurrying to
                  and fro imparting a cheerfulness to the prospect and an aspect of bustling
                  activity new to the youth familiar only with the dulness of a small country town.
                  Within a few hours one of those dense, yellow fogs, peculiar to London, had risen
                  and enshrouded the city obscurity: there was still the same hurry and bustle,
                  indeed it appeared to have increased, for the noise of the carts and carriages,
                  unseen till close at hand, the oaths of the drivers as their vehicles, in spite of
                  all their caution, came into frequent collision, the lights in the shops glaring
                  unnaturally through the greasy vapor, and the shadowy forms of the pedestrians as
                  they loomed up suddenly, like monstrous spectres, and the next moment jostled each
                  other on the side walk, added to the seeming confusion to the eye of a stranger
                  from the country, visiting the city for the first time. Gerald asked a waiter in
                  the hotel, which was the most direct way to Board street, and having received the
                  information he required he started forth intending to take his time and look about
                  him as he went. There was, however, little to be seen, except in the shop windows;
                  but those often arrested the boy's attention, and caused him to stop and admire
                  the showy goods displayed therein until some fresh display again induced him to
                  stop. By and by the fog lifted a little and his attention was so taken up with the
                  novelty of the scene, that he quite forgot the directions given him at the hotel. <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Trudging along, unknowing what he sought,</l>
                        <l>And whistling as he went for want of thought,"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> he walked on for at least a couple of hours, and until his legs begun to grow
                  weary. Then, for the first time, the idea struck him that he must be very near his
                  destination, or else must have wandered far out of his way.</p>
               <p>He spoke to the first good-natured looking person he met, and asked how far he was
                  from Broad St., Bloomsbury.</p>
               <p>"Broad Street, Bloomsbury," repeated the person questioned. "You are a long way
                  from it, my boy—and going quite in the contrary direction. Where have you come
                  from?"</p>
               <p>"From the Blue Boar Inn, Holborn," said Gerald.</p>
               <p>"Why, my little man, you've come a long way out of the<pb n="128-129"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000065"/> way. This is St. Martin's Lane. You must turn back
                  and retrace your steps. You're a stranger to London?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Gerald.</p>
               <p>"So I should think," said the man. "You should have asked your way before you got
                  so far wrong, my lad. However, I'll put you right, as well as I can," and he gave
                  him the necessary directions, advising him, however, to make fresh inquiries every
                  now and then, to make sure he was going the right way.</p>
               <p>Gerald was beginning to feel hungry, however, and he thought he would stop at the
                  first decent looking public house he came to and get something to eat. He still
                  had one of his sovereigns unchanged, and a few shillings besides, saved out of his
                  coach-fare, and he soon found a house respectable enough in appearance, yet not so
                  stylish as to give him the impression that the charge would be beyond his
                  means.</p>
               <p>He walked in, and stepping up to the bar, asked if he could have some bread and
                  cheese.</p>
               <p>"To be sure," said the landlord; "in one minute, sir. Please to walk into the
                  parlor. What shall I send you in to drink—ale or porter?"</p>
               <p>The boy was unused to drink spirituous liquors of any kind, yet he felt so tired,
                  and so much in need of refreshment, that he thought a glass of ale would do him no
                  harm. "Fine Burton ale on draught" was painted in glory letters inside the bar. He
                  had often heard of Burton ale, and thought he should like to taste it; so,
                  regardless of the moral of Jemmy Milton's marvelous story, he ordered a glass of
                  that generous liquor.</p>
               <p>It was soon brought to him, accompanied with a roll and a large slice of Cheshire
                  cheese, and he quickly set to work to satisfy his appetite.</p>
               <p>There were three or four gentlemanly looking men in the parlor to which he had
                  been shown, who were amusing themselves at a bagatelle board, and after a short
                  time one them left his companions and seated himself by Gerald's side. "You are
                  from the country, young gentleman?" said he, addressing the boy.</p>
               <p>"Yes sir," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"So I thought; you have not the appearance of a London boy; besides, you have not
                  the appearance of a London boy; besides, you have a bundle with you. What part of
                  the country do you come from?"</p>
               <p>"From Kent," replied Gerald.</p>
               <p>"Ah, from Kent, eh? I'm well acquainted with Kent. Do you come from the
                  seacoast?"</p>
               <p>"From Herrington," said Gerald.</p>
               <p>"Indeed! I have friends there; perhaps you are acquainted with them. Do you know
                  Mrs. ——, what is the name now—it's at my tongue's end—Mr. ——</p>
               <p>"I am acquainted with Mr. Pierce, the vicar, and with Doctor Knight," said
                  Gerald.</p>
               <p>"The very man. How could I have forgotten the name. Mr. Pearce is an old friend of
                  mine, and so is Doctor Knight. I think I have met you at Mr. Pearce's, but, for
                  the life of me I can't recal your name."</p>
               <p>"My name is Gerald Dalton."</p>
               <p>"Gerald Dalton is it possible? How strange that we should have met here. Why I
                  know your father as well—"</p>
               <p>"My father is dead," interrupted Gerald. "He died in America several years ago. I
                  have an uncle who used to live in Herrington, but he is in London Now."</p>
               <p>"To be sure. How stupid of me—it is your uncle I mean. He is in London, is he? I
                  should like to see him. Martin," addressing one of the gentlemen at the bagatelle
                  table, "this is a nephew of our friend Dalton, of Herrington."</p>
               <p>"My uncle's name is Ashley," said Gerald.</p>
               <p>"Certainly, Mr. Ashley I meant. Your name's Dalton, you see, and I confound the
                  two. But come, your glass is empty, I perceive. Take another glass of ale with me,
                  for old acquaintance sake. You'll join us, Martin? Waiter, three glasses of ale
                  here."</p>
               <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7199-00000066"/>
               <p>"I had rather not take any more ale, thank you," said Gerald.</p>
               <p>"Pooh, pooh! another glass of ale with an old friend won't hurt you. You might
                  drink a gallon of this ale, and be none the worse for it."</p>
               <p>Gerald's long walk through the streets of London had made him very thirsty, and
                  after some further demur, he allowed himself to be persuaded. The ale was brought
                  by the waiter, and the boy drew his purse from his pocket to pay for the
                  refreshment he had called for at the bar, disclosing, as he did so, the sovereign
                  among the loose silver.</p>
               <p>The strangers grew more friendly.</p>
               <p>"The young gentleman doesn't recollect us, Martin," said the one who had first
                  addressed Gerald. "Strange, isn't it?"</p>
               <p>"When were you in Herrington?" asked Gerald.</p>
               <p>"When was it? Let me see—about a year ago, wasn't it, Martin? We put up at the
                  King's Arms Inn. We visited Mr. Pearce several times, and it was there I met you
                  with your father—your uncle I mean."</p>
               <p>"I don't recollect having been at Mr. Pearce's with my uncle at any time, at least
                  until a few days before I left; but it may be so."</p>
               <p>"Of course; it must be so, or how should I have recognized you as soon as you
                  entered the room?"</p>
               <p>Had Gerald thought, he might have recollected that he was not recognized until he
                  himself had told his name; but the ale, a gallon of which might be drunk without
                  any one feeling the worse for it, had already begun to affect him; not so much,
                  however, from its own natural potency as from the effects of a certain powder
                  which, unperceived by him, had been put into his glass by one of his new friends.
                  He answered at random a variety of questions that were put to him; related the
                  cause of his visit to London; talked a great deal of nonsense; dozed off, and
                  awoke with a start; again dozed and awoke, and at last fell fast asleep with his
                  head on the table. He felt a rough hand tugging at the collar of his jacket, and a
                  rude voice called out:—</p>
               <p>"Come youngster, are you going to sleep here all night? We're going to shut up.
                  You must be jogging. Come," and again the rough hand tugged at his collar.</p>
               <p>He looked up; his head was aching dreadfully, and there seemed to be a fog before
                  his eyes. The lamp was burning feebly, and shedding a sickly light over the room;
                  but the light seemed to float in a cloud of mist, and there was a ring round it
                  which danced up and down, and dazzled the boy's eyes as he gazed vacantly at
                  it.</p>
               <p>"Come, are you going to get up?" repeated the rude voice.</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes. Where am I?" said Gerald.</p>
               <p>"Come, that won't do; that's a pretty go. Where are you? Why, you're in the parlor
                  of the Red Lion, and you've been a snorin like vinking for the last three hours,
                  till you've drove everybody out o' the house. Come, jog—don't be a falling asleep
                  again."</p>
               <p>"What's o'clock?" said Gerald. "Oh, how my head aches!"</p>
               <p>"No vonder; you shouldn't get drunk. Vy, it's past twelve o'clock, and time you
                  was home. Come, are you going?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Gerald, looking vacantly around him. "Where—where's my bundle?"</p>
               <p>"How should I know?" said the waiter; "you didn't bring no bundle here as I knows
                  on."</p>
               <p>"But I did," said the boy, pressing his hand upon his heated forehead. It was
                  lying here beside me when I fell asleep. I've been robbed."</p>
               <p>"Hush that now; hush that," said the man; "don't go for to say you've been robbed
                  here. The Red Lion won't stand that, no how. You'd better pay for the half gallon
                  of ale you ordered."</p>
               <p>"I ordered no ale, only one glass that I paid for," said Gerald "I did not finish
                  the second glass the gentleman called for; part of it stands here now."</p>
               <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7199-00000067"/>
               <p>"Well, that's a pretty how-d' ye-do," said the waiter; "first you've been robbed;
                  then you refuses to pay for the ale you ordered. Here, come out and talk to the
                  landlord; he'll soon put you to rights," and again seizing the boy by the collar
                  of his jacket, he dragged him into the bar room, where the landlord was still
                  standing behind the bar.</p>
               <p>"Here's a chap," said the waiter, "who says as he's been robbed in this house, and
                  he refuses to pay his bill."</p>
               <p>"What do you mean by that, you young scamp?" cried the landlord. "How much is it,
                  Tom?"</p>
               <p>"Four-and-six for ale, and two and-six for sandwiches ordered for the coves as
                  left just now afore I waked this chap up—seven shillings in all."</p>
               <p>"You'd better pay it afore I call the watch," said the landlord.</p>
               <p>Poor Gerald, dreadfully frightened at this threat, put his hand into his pocket to
                  find his purse. It was gone; everything that his pocket had contained was gone,
                  and he was penniless.</p>
               <p>"My purse has been stolen, and the bundle I had with me besides," he said.</p>
               <p>"Oh, you're a deep one!" said the landlord. "Take care what you say; don't go too
                  far, or I'll have you arrested for making false charges and injuring the character
                  of my house. Be off with you at once. There, turn him out, Tom, and lock the door.
                  The young vagabond ain't got no money to pay his score," and in spite of his
                  remonstrances, Gerald was violently thrust into the street, and the door locked
                  upon him.</p>
               <p>The heavy fog had turned to rain, and but for the oil lamps the night would have
                  been dark as pitch; as it was, they but served to make the dreariness visible. The
                  streets were deserted, except by a few benighted pedestrians who hurried past with
                  their great coasts closely buttoned and the collars turned up, and these hurried
                  by, taking no heed of the boy's eager inquiries how far it was to the Blue Boar,
                  Halborn, at which hostelry he hoped to find his uncle, who he knew would be
                  anxiously expecting him.</p>
               <p>Drenched with rain, and so sick and stupefied that he thought not whither he was
                  going, or what he was doing; only desirous of finding some shelter where he could
                  lie down and rest and sleep till morning, poor Gerald wandered bewildered along
                  the dark, dirty, dismal streets. He was parched with a consuming thirst; had a
                  house of any kind been open; had only a light appeared in a window telling that
                  somebody was astir within, he would have knocked at the door and asked for a drink
                  of water; but there was none. At last he came in his wanderings to a public house
                  at which horses were accustomed to bait. A horse-trough was before the house, and
                  he drank greedily from it, and then, slightly refreshed, looked around him for
                  some place where he could obtain shelter from the rain and rest till morning.</p>
               <p>There was a stable yard in the rear of the inn, and several carts were standing
                  beneath the shelter of a thatched roof. Into one of these he crept and lay down to
                  sleep, but he had not rested long before he found his limbs grow so stiff that he
                  was afraid if he remained there till daylight he would be crippled. Again he
                  sallied forth into the dark streets, but he had been seen by a watchman, who
                  advanced towards him and collared him.</p>
               <p>"Hallo, youngster!" said he, "what are you doing here this time o'night, lurking
                  about the inn-yard, eh?"</p>
               <p>Gerald, his teeth chattering and his limbs trembling with cold, endeavored to tell
                  his story.</p>
               <p>"A likely tale, that," said the guardian of the night; "a very pretty story to
                  tell; but it won't do. You want a lodging for the night, eh? Well, I'll find you a
                  lodging for the night, and, perhaps, for a good many nights. Come along," and,
                  still retaining hold of the boy's collar, he dragged, rather than led him through
                  the streets until they reached a dark, gloomy building, the doors and windows of
                  which were secured by stout iron bars.</p>
               <p>The watchman rang the night-bell; there was a rattling of<pb n="134-135"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000068"/> bolts and chains, and then the door swang slowly,
                  creaking on its hinges, and Gerald was dragged into a room paved with stone and
                  garnished with handcuffs.</p>
               <p>"Halloa! who have you here, Martin?" said the porter. 'What young thief is
                  that?"</p>
               <p>"A sneak as I catched comin' out of the Bell and Dragon coachyard," replied the
                  man addressed. "Is Mr. Jenkins in?"</p>
               <p>"Ay, I fancy he's in the private office. I seed him there awhile ago."</p>
               <p>"Many in quod to-night?" asked the watchman.</p>
               <p>"A tolerable many; the nights's stormy, and they always comes in pretty thick such
                  nights."</p>
               <p>"Well, tell Mr. Jenkins as I've got a prisoner here as I want him to examine,
                  afore he goes to the cells."</p>
               <p>The porter disappeared in the private office, but shortly returned in company with
                  the sergeant of the watch, who had been designated as Mr. Jenkins. The said Mr.
                  Jenkins was a young man, of rather a jaunty aspect, who did not seem to be
                  particularly pleased at being roused from the comfortable snooze in which he had
                  been indulging.</p>
               <p>"What's the charge, Martin?" he demanded in a surly voice.</p>
               <p>"I found this here young feller a skulking round the yard of the Bell and Dragon,
                  sir, and took him into custody accordingly.</p>
               <p>"What was he doing?"</p>
               <p>"He was a skulking about the yard in a burglarious fashion, sir, and couldn't give
                  no account of his self."</p>
               <p>"Ha! he looks like a young thief—have you searched his person?" said the
                  sergeant.</p>
               <p>"No sir, not yet; mebby he has got the tools about him, though."</p>
               <p>"Well, we'll see," said the sergeant; "come, youngster, empty out your pockets,
                  and let's see."</p>
               <p>The demand was a vain one; poor Gerald turned his pockets inside out; there was
                  nothing in them.</p>
               <p>"Oh, he's sly," said the watchman; "he's dropped the tools when he seed me a
                  comin' to grab him. He's a cute un, he is; anybody can see that."</p>
               <p>Search him thoroughly, and see that he has nothing concealed upon his person,"
                  said the sergeant. "Pull off your boots, youngster. Come, no whimpering, or it
                  'ill be the worse for you."</p>
               <p>Gerald pulled off his boots, his coat, and his vest, at the command of the
                  sergeant, but all their scrutiny was to no purpose, nothing could be found upon
                  him.</p>
               <p>"Let's hear what you've got to say for yourself," said the sergeant, addressing
                  the boy, after the fruitless search had been concluded.</p>
               <p>Gerald repeated the story he had already told the watchman. "So you think I
                  believe that, do you?" said the sergeant. "No, no, my boy. I'm too well used to
                  deal with such chaps as you. You want a lodging, eh? Well, I'll find you a lodging
                  free gratis to-night, and to-morrow, and perhaps you'll get handsomely furnished
                  lodgings for some months to come—meat and drink provided at the expense of the
                  city, nothing at all to do for it but just to step up and down on the tread-mill.
                  Nice pleasant exercise, with a job now and then at picking oakum, by way of
                  change. Take him down to the cells, and lock him up till morning," addressing the
                  porter. "Come, be off, no blubbering, and see, if anybody else comes in, you just
                  lock 'em up till daylight, Nixon, and don't trouble me again, unless it's
                  something very particular."</p>
               <p>The sergeant returned to the private office, and Gerald was led by the porter of
                  the watch-house along a narrow damp passage and down a flight of dismal stone
                  steps, and then along another passage, with cells on either side, and into one of
                  the furthest of these he was thrust, the key was turned upon him, and he was left
                  in utter darkness: but not alone; heavy snoring betrayed to him the fact that he
                  had more than one companion in misery, but, whoever they were, they had not<pb
                     n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7199-00000069"/> been roused by his entrance into the
                  foul den, and though Gerald shuddered when he heard the click of the heavy lock
                  and the clank of the rusty bolts, as they were drawn by his jailor, he was so
                  wearied in body and mind that he, too, was soon asleep, and happily oblivious of
                  his wretched condition.</p>
               <p>When he awoke, with his bones chafed and sore from lying upon the rude bench which
                  had served him for a couch, the feeble rays of daylight were just struggling in
                  through the grated bars of the cell, making its desolation visible. His companions
                  in wretchedness, a man—as he now saw by the dim light—past middle age, and a youth
                  about twenty years old, were still sleeping, but from their restless tossing to
                  and fro on their hard resting-place, it was evident that they would soon awake.
                  Gerald, as he looked at their repulsive features, dreaded the moment when they
                  should awake and realize the face that another occupant had shared their cell
                  during the night. Both were squalid in appearance, and meanly dressed, and the
                  head of the elder prisoner, whose hat had fallen off in his sleep, was perfectly
                  bald, or, rather, closely shaven, for the better convenience of disguising himself
                  with a wig. His features were coarse and singularly ferocious, and the general
                  expression of his countenance was not improved by a stubbly heard of three or four
                  days' growth, growing high up on his cheek-bones. The younger man was not so ugly;
                  but vice and dissipation had already stamped his visage with their indelible
                  marks.</p>
               <p>Presently the elder prisoner stretched his arms above his head, and yawning
                  frightfully, opened his eyes, at the same time pushing the younger man, who was
                  sleeping by his side, and with an oath bidding him rise.</p>
               <p>Both lazily sat up on the bench and then for the first time saw their fellow
                  prisoner, whose general aspect, with his clothes soiled and dried upon him, was in
                  few respects much better than theirs.</p>
               <p>"Hillo! who the dickens have we here?" said the elder prisoner, making a mock
                  eye-glass with the thumb and forefinger finger of his left hand, and peering
                  through it. "An interloper during the night, eh? Ho, youngster, what are you in
                  for? You're a stranger. What lay are you on?"</p>
               <p>Gerald told his story in as few words as possible, and expressed a hope that he
                  would soon be released from the cell and taken before a magistrate, when he felt
                  assured he should be permitted to go free.</p>
               <p>"Gammon!" exclaimed the younger of his companions. "Stash that. You can't come
                  that ere move over us. Don't sneak, but say at once what dodge you're in for?"</p>
               <p>Gerald was too shocked to reply, and his two companions commenced talking to him
                  in their jargon; but finding he would not or could not understand them, they
                  cursed him for a sneak, and busied themselves with talking over their own affairs
                  and making various conjectures relative to their chances of escape when brought up
                  before the "beak," as they termed the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Happily for Gerald a great portion of the jargon in which this conversation was
                  carried on was unintelligible to him, and in the course of an hour the cell door
                  was opened and the prisoners were ordered to go up stairs and prepare to join a
                  procession composed of the tenants of the adjoining cells to march to the
                  Guildhall, and appear before the sitting magistrate.</p>
               <p>Poor Gerald had now to submit to the indignity of being handcuffed to a youth of
                  about his own age, and then in company with some twenty others, to parade through
                  the streets to the court of justice. His companions of the past night were both
                  committed to take their trial for burglary and marched off to Newgate prison, and
                  then Gerald was called upon.</p>
               <p>"What charge is against this boy?" asked the magistrate.</p>
               <p>"I found him, please your worship," said the watchman who had arrested him,
                  "skulking suspiciously about the stable yard of the Bell and Dragon, and he
                  couldn't give no account of him self, so I took him into custody."</p>
               <p>"Did you find any property upon him?" inquired the magistrate.</p>
               <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7199-00000070"/>
               <p>"No, your worship. He told a cock and bull story, as how he'd been robbed at a
                  public house, which he didn't know the name of, nor the street, which was
                  suspicious, so I took him to the watch house for a vagrant."</p>
               <p>"What have you got to say for yourself, my lad?" said the magistrate, addressing
                  Gerald. "How came you to be wandering about the streets at midnight, without any
                  apparent object?"</p>
               <p>Again Gerald told his story, and this time to a better purpose. The magistrate
                  listened attentively and scrutinized him closely while he was speaking, and when
                  he had concluded, said:—</p>
               <p>"I think, my boy, that you are telling the truth. I hope so, at least, and I shall
                  discharge you and direct one of the officers of the court to accompany you to the
                  Blue Boar, where you say your uncle is staying, but let this be a warning to you
                  not to fall again into bad company. You can go, and you, officer," addressing a
                  man who stood near, "accompany him to the inn at which his uncle is stopping."</p>
               <p>Gerald thanked the magistrate and left the Guildhall in company with the officer,
                  and in the course of half an hour, found himself at the inn add in the presence of
                  his uncle, who had been to Broad street early that morning to see him, and
                  learning that nothing had been heard of him there, had become greatly alarmed
                  concerning him, and had conjured up all sorts of terrible fancies. He was so glad
                  to see him that he forgot to scold him, and Gerald, after changing his clothing
                  and making a hearty breakfast, retired to his bedroom to rest himself after the
                  fatigues of the last eventful twenty-four hours.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ashley, who had again to appear at Exeter Hall that day, extorted a promise
                  from his nephew that he would not leave the inn till his return, when he would
                  accompany him to Broad-street, and having done this, he started for the Hall.</p>
               <p>It was late in the afternoon when he returned, in excellent sprits, for thanks to
                  the exertions of his friends, his application had been successful, not certainly
                  to the full extent of his hopes, for he had been informed by the bishop that were
                  insuperable objections to his being ordained as a minister of the Established
                  Church, the chief of which were the want of an University education, (although he
                  had learnt quite as much Greek and Latin, and Theology, at Hackney college, as he
                  could have learnt at Oxford or Cambridge,) and the fact of his once having
                  occupied the position of a dissenting minister. However, to oblige his good friend
                  the member of Parliament, the bishop had stretched a point, and had promised him
                  the appointment of Teacher Superintendent over the new Mission School in the
                  island of Ceylon, and he was to sail for that distant island with his family in
                  two months from that day.</p>
               <p>Sanguine as usual, Mr. Ashley thought not of the difficulties that still lay in
                  his way: of the expenses he should have to incur, though his passage out to the
                  colony would be paid by the Society, nor of the distance from home of his place of
                  destination. India was to him a land of wealth and promise, and his fancy pictured
                  his young family happily provided for by fortune in that distant land.</p>
               <p>It was too late to go to Broad-street with his nephew that evening; besides he had
                  to write home to his wife and to Mr. Pearce, though he was too much excited with
                  his success to do either properly, so the visit to the picture dealer's was
                  deferred until the following morning.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Which relates how Mr. Ashley went to Ceylon, and treats of a mystery hereafter
                     to be explained.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS soon as they had taken breakfast the next morning, Mr. Ashley and Gerald set
                  out for the picture-dealer's in Broad-street, Bloomsbury, Gerald taking his trunk
                  with him, it, as well as his pocket, being much lightened in consequence of the
                  mishap that attended his first day's ramble in London. Mr. Ashley, having hired a
                  hackney coach, they soon reached their destination, and Gerald was kindly welcomed
                  by Mr. Hoffmann.</p>
               <p>It was a strange place in which he found himself. Mr. Hoffmann had been called a
                  picture-dealer by Mr. Pearce, and so he was, truly; but he was a dealer in almost
                  everything under the sun besides. His long, dark, gloomy shop contained a
                  heterogeneous collection, such as could be found in no other place but just such a
                  shop. in London. And the proprietor, eccentric in manners and appearance, was just
                  the personage one would have pictured as the owner of such a singular collection
                  of goods. Mr. Hoffmann was verging towards his seventieth year, but was hale and
                  hearty as a man of fifty. He still adhered scrupulously to the costume of the day
                  when he was a young man. A cocked hat, a long skirted coat with wide cuffs, a
                  waistcoat, the flaps of which reached nearly to his knee, knee-breeches, black
                  worsted stocking, and square-toed shoes with immense silver buckles, completed his
                  attire. Hair powder he had banished, as appertaining to the frivolity of youth,
                  but he still cherished with pride a queue or pigtail, tightly rolled up in black
                  silk ribbon, and sometimes very greasy in appearance. He was of German descent, as
                  his name implied, but his grandfather had settled in England early in life, and
                  therefore all traces of the German, except the patronymic, had departed from the
                  grandson.</p>
               <p>He had commenced life as an auctioneer, but had soon given up the trade of selling
                  other people's goods, alone, and taken to buying and selling anything and
                  everything by which he thought he could turn an honest penny. His shop and the
                  extensive warerooms beyond, did contain several pictures of great in value, but
                  these were swallowed up and lost to sight in the collection of household and other
                  furniture, which, with ancient armor, hardware and china vases, fire-arms and
                  swords and daggers, from the slender blade and ornamented hilt of the officer's
                  side arm, to the heavy, rusty Andrew Ferrara, from the Turkish cimetar to the
                  Malay cresse—fashioned in Birmingham. Nor were musical instruments wanting, from
                  the old-fashioned spinnett and harpsichord to the modern piano-forte, from the
                  fife to the kettle-drum. In fact, there were few things that could be named that
                  could not be found in Mr. Hoffmann's collections, and not a day passed that he did
                  not attend some auction and add still to his strange miscellany. The wonder only
                  was, what he did with them; to whom he sold them again; who could purchase from
                  such a collection of oddities! For sell them he did, to a certainty; aye, and make
                  money by the transaction, too; for Mr. Hoffman was a wealthy man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ashley shortly took leave of his nephew, he being anxious to return home to
                  Sandgate and make preparations for the dust from his shoes upon Sandgate and
                  Herrington, which had been fraught with so much inhospitality to him and his; and
                  the remaining portion of the day Gerald spent in looking around the store and
                  seeking to make himself acquainted with its singular and miscellaneous
                  contents.</p>
               <pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7199-00000072"/>
               <p>The next morning he was informed of the nature of the duties required of him,
                  which were chiefly confined to taking charge of the shop while Mr. Hoffmann was
                  out seeking to increase his store, and keeping the more valuable articles free
                  from dust and dirt. He had little or nothing to do with pictures or paintings, as
                  he had anticipated, and as may be supposed, was not too well satisfied with his
                  employment; but he did his duty faithfully, and succeeded in gaining the
                  confidence of his employer, and better still, in gaining the favor of the old
                  lady, his wife, who, having no children of her own living, became much attached to
                  the boy.</p>
               <p>In this employment Gerald remained for three years, only once during that period
                  paying a brief visit to his mother and Alice Thornton, at Herrington.</p>
               <p>A few months prior to this visit a stranger, apparently about forty years of age,
                  gentlemanly in manners and appearance, and sunburnt, as if he had spent a portion
                  of his life beneath the burning sun of a tropical clime, arrived in Herrington,
                  and put up at the King's Arms, then the principal hotel in the town.</p>
               <p>The morning after his arrival he called upon the vicar, and made various inquiries
                  respecting Alice Thornton. There was something in his manner that did not
                  altogether satisfy the vicar, but he brought a letter from Mr. Ashley, whom he had
                  met in Ceylon, and who, although he had found many unexpected drawbacks, was, it
                  appeared, tolerably well satisfied with his position abroad, in which letter the
                  stranger, Mr. Craddock, was highly spoken of; consequently, the vicar freely gave
                  him such information as he required, and as lay in his power to give. He, however,
                  advised him to call upon Mrs. Dalton, with whom Miss Thornton was still residing,
                  where he could learn more from her respecting the young lady than it was in his
                  power to tell.</p>
               <p>This Mr. Craddock promised to do, and left the vicarage with, as Mr. Pearce
                  supposed, the intention of calling upon Mrs. Dalton. But that evening Alice, who
                  had been out walking ing upon the cliffs, did not return home, and the stranger
                  had on that afternoon paid his bill at the King's Arms, and stating that
                  unexpected business called him to London, had hurriedly taken his departure.</p>
               <p>The Widow Dalton was greatly disturbed at the strange disappearance of Alice, whom
                  she loved as a daughter. The general belief, when her absence became known in the
                  town, was that she had fallen from the cliff, and the beach and brushwood was
                  searched for miles, but no traces of her could be found. Then, after the lapse of
                  a few days, some of the coast-guards-men recollected that they had seed a young
                  woman, answering Alice's appearance, walking with a gentleman on the cliff. They
                  had turned off into the highroad, and shortly afterwards the sound of carriage
                  wheels was heard—and people shook their heads and said that Alice had been
                  forcibly abducted by the strange, foreign-looking gentleman who had stopped at the
                  King's Arms, and had been spirited off to London or to foreign parts. Nay, some
                  went so far as to say they believed the stranger was the "gentleman in black,"
                  unmentionable by his proper name to ears polite, and that Alice had met with a
                  more terrible fate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pearce called upon Mrs. Dalton, and related the conversation he had held with
                  the stranger, and he alone came to the more sensible conclusion that no harm was
                  intended the young lady, but that probably the stranger was relative, who had some
                  urgent reason for his conduct.</p>
               <p>However, he advertised for the young lady in vain, and at last both he and the
                  widow came to the conclusion to write to Mr. Ashley at Ceylon, and learn, if
                  possible, who this Mr. Craddock was, that had been so intimate with him abroad,
                  and also whether Alice had any relations living that Mr. Ashley was aware of. It
                  would, of course, be many months before an answer could be received from Mr.
                  Ashley, but it appeared to be the only resource left to Mrs. Dalton. No one
                  grieved more at this sudden and strange disappearance of Miss Thornton<pb
                     n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7199-00000073"/> ton than Gerald, who had, until
                  latterly unknown to himself, nourished a secret attachment for the playmate of his
                  childhood.</p>
               <p>He believed that she had been carried away by the stranger, who had made so brief
                  a sojourn in Herrington, and though he had no idea to what part of the world she
                  had been carried, if, indeed, she were not still in England, he cherished the
                  Quixotic idea of setting out in search of her, if, when the expected letter
                  arrived from Ceylon, Mr. Ashley furnished no information regarding her.</p>
               <p>The duties which Gerald was called to perform in Mr. Hoffmann's warehouse of
                  miscellanies, were not such as suited his ambition, although he endeavored to
                  please, and succeeded, in performing them satisfactorily. He longed for a wider
                  sphere of action, a greater scope for the development of his adventurous nature,
                  but how to escape from the irksome drudgery to which he was subjected, he knew
                  not; and still he did not wish to leave England until news should come from Mr.
                  Ashley, in India.</p>
               <p>During his late visit to Herrington he had been sorely troubled to witness the
                  failure in his mother's health. The confinement necessary in the arduous
                  employment in which she was engaged, had undermined her constitution, always
                  delicate, and it was evident to him that her life depended upon her cessation from
                  the irksome and incessant toil at her needle, to which she was subjected.</p>
               <p>Gerald was now in the eighteenth year of his age, and he looked fully three years
                  older, and yet he had no power to render her any assistance. His board and
                  lodging, and a sufficient pittance to enable himself to provide himself with
                  clothing, was all that he earned at the warehouse. Nor did he perceive any
                  immediate prospect of bettering his position. Before he could enter upon the study
                  of any congenial and remunerative profession, a large fee would be demanded of
                  him, and then several years of serve study would be necessary before could earn
                  anything for himself. He was naturally interested in the land of his birth, and
                  when he read or heard of the success which attends industry in the United States,
                  he earnestly longed to return thither and try his own fortune in that young and
                  energetic country. To be sure, his father's endeavors while there had failed; but
                  the boy, born in poverty and tutored in early life to privation, and in the
                  knowledge that his success in life must depend upon his own exertions, knew
                  perfectly well the rock upon which the hopes and endeavors of his father had
                  split. Could he go back to America with his mother, he believed he would soon be
                  enabled by his own exertions to maintain himself and his parent in comfort, and so
                  relieve her from all further labor. Had he been quite alone in the world, he would
                  have worked his passage to America, and trusted to his own energies for support,
                  when he reached the EI Dorado of his youthful imagination. Had his mother been
                  well in health, or even provided with some less irksome means of obtaining her
                  living, he would have sought from her permission to go and seek his fortune, in
                  the hope of soon being able to send for her to rejoin him; but in the present
                  precarious condition of her health he dared not think further of the matter.</p>
               <p>He spoke to the vicar, who was still very friendly, on the subject, and Mr. Pearce
                  promised to assist him in his plans.</p>
               <p>"Your mother has been carefully nurtured and well-educated, Gerald," he said, when
                  the youth introduced subject, "perhaps if I caused an advertisement to be put in
                  the <title>London Times,</title> she might obtain a situation as governess. At all
                  events, there is no harm in trying."</p>
               <p>"I would willingly do so, but I have not the means," was Gerald's reply. "I know
                  that advertising is very expensive."</p>
               <p>"You speak truly, it is so," said the vicar; "but I have no objection to lend you
                  the trifle that will be required; some day you will be enabled to repay me, I
                  know, and if not—"</p>
               <p>"If I live you shall be repaid, sir," interrupted Gerald. "I can never forget your
                  kindness."</p>
               <pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7199-00000074"/>
               <p>"Don't mention that, my boy," replied the vicar. "I know you are grateful, and
                  that is enough; but don't be too sanguine; there are so many persons seeking
                  situations of a similar description; and then, in some of these situations, the
                  labor required is even greater and more irksome than that in which your mother is
                  now engaged, and the remuneration a mere pittance. But we will see what can be
                  done. How long do you remain here?"</p>
               <p>"I have permission from Mr. Hoffmann to stay a month, sir; I have been home a week
                  to day."</p>
               <p>"Very well; you needn't say anything to your mother; I will write an advertisement
                  out and send it for insertion, to London, to-morrow."</p>
               <p>Gerald thanked the worthy clergyman, and after conversing for some time on other
                  matters, returned home.</p>
               <p>The advertisement was duly forwarded, and inserted for a week, and at the
                  expiration of that time, three answers were received by Mr. Pearce; but, as he had
                  anticipated, not one of them was suitable. They required the possession, by the
                  advertiser, of every conceivable accomplishment, and demanded, also, the control
                  of her whole time; insisted, in fact, that for less than the wages of an upper
                  servant, she should perform the joint duties of a servant and a governess. Out of
                  the three, there was not one that could have been chosen in preference to
                  another.</p>
               <p>Dr. Knight, who was attending the widow professionally, and who delicately
                  insisted, for friendships' sake, in giving advice and sending medicine
                  gratuitously, was privy to the endeavors the vicar was making to serve her, and he
                  called at the vicarage one morning, for the express purpose of seeing Mr. Pearce,
                  upon the subject.</p>
               <p>"Young Dalton," said he, after having informed the vicar of the object of his
                  visit, "has told me that you have been unsuccessful in your endeavors to obtain a
                  suitable situation for his mother, as a governess. Poor! he looks very
                  crest-fallen about it."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said the vicar. "The advertisement has been answered, but the situations
                  that offer themselves are not such as would suit. They would entail server toil
                  than she has to perform at present. And yet something ought to be done for her. I
                  have not seen her for some time past; but I called after Gerald told me of her
                  failing health, and was really shocked at her altered appearance. What do you
                  think of her case, doctor?"</p>
               <p>"She is very unwell," replied Doctor Knight, "and if she remains here she will not
                  live another year. The air of the sea coast is too keen for her."</p>
               <p>"She is not, I trust, dangerously ill? said the vicar.</p>
               <p>"Not exactly so at present," returned the doctor. "Change of air and change in her
                  mode of life may do wonders; but she is not strong, and will scarcely live to wear
                  gray hairs on her head."</p>
               <p>Has she no friends at all, who, if they were aware of her condition, would be
                  willing to serve her?" said the clergyman.</p>
               <p>"I never heard Mr. Ashley say anything in relation to her, except that she was his
                  sister-in law, and that her husband died in America."</p>
               <p>"You were intimate, I believe, with Mrs. Ashley's family before her marriage?"</p>
               <p>"Not very intimate," replied the doctor, "but I was slightly acquainted with Mr.
                  Dalton—Squire Dalton, as he was called. I was studying medicine at the time, and
                  once attended a party given at Dalton Hall. Mr. Dalton was then supposed to be a
                  wealthy man. His son, who subsequently married the present Widow Dalton—a very
                  worthy, excellent young man he was—was then at college. The old gentleman died
                  completely bankrupt soon afterwards, and in the course of time I heard that young
                  Dalton had married a poor but amiable and highly accomplished girl, who was
                  dependant upon a miserly churl of an uncle, and that Miss Dalton had married a
                  young and penniless dissenting minister. That was all I knew about the family
                  until I came to Herrington to practice my profession, when,<pb n="148-149"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000075"/> through my former slight intimacy with Mrs. Ashley,
                  I became acquainted with her husband. From him I heard that the old miser had been
                  glad enough to get his ward off his hands—the marriage, I believe, was
                  clandestine—and had shortly afterwards married his housekeeper—a low-minded,
                  vulgar woman—and dying a year or two afterwards, he left her the whole of his
                  property. She married a second time, and left that part of the country—so I
                  suppose it would be useless to seek assistance from <emph>her,</emph> even if we
                  knew where she is to be found. She had, for interested motives, always disliked
                  the young lady; and as to Mr. Ashley's relatives, they all forsook her, when,
                  after her father's death, she married her present husband.</p>
               <p>"Poor thing" exclaimed the vicar. "Then, I suppose, we needn't look for any
                  assistance from them?"</p>
               <p>"I fear not," returned the doctor. "But I am forgetting my object in making this
                  call. Looking over the <title>London Times</title> yesterday, I saw this
                  advertisement, and I thought that possibly it might suit Mrs. Dalton, though it is
                  nothing to boast of;" and taking the paper from his coat-pocket, he handed it to
                  the vicar, who read as follows:</p>
               <p>"The rector of a parish in the country of Huntingdon, who has established, at his
                  own expense, a boys' and girls' school in the village in which his church is
                  located, is desirous of securing the services of a competent school-mistress for
                  the latter school. He would be happy to make an engagement with a widow lady who
                  had become reduced in circumstances, but has had the advantages of a good
                  education. The duties will be light, and of course the tuition will be confined to
                  common English education, plain sewing, &amp;c., but the advertiser would give the
                  preference to a person superior to the ordinary run of village school-mistresses.
                  The salary will be ¥30 a year, house, coal, and candle free. Address the Rev. Wm.
                  Davis, Morley's Hotel, Charing Cross, for one week, stating qualifications, and
                  giving proper references. None other than persons of acknowledged piety need
                  apply."</p>
               <p>"The very thing," said the vicar, when he read the advertisement. "I know Mr.
                  Davis by reputation. He is a most worthy man, and possessing an independent income
                  of his own, he devotes the whole of his income from the rector-ship to charitable
                  purposes. I will write to him immediately. Mrs. Dalton is exactly fitted for the
                  situation."</p>
               <p>"Of what parish has he the charge?" asked the doctor.</p>
               <p>"Let me think," said the vicar. "Abbot, ah! Abbotsford, in Huntingdonshire, that's
                  the place; but we must write to Morley's Hotel, in London, you know.'</p>
               <p>"Of course," returned the doctor, "and then we must devise some method of
                  transporting the widow there."</p>
               <p>"You forget that we don't know that we shall succeed yet," said the vicar, smiling
                  at the doctor's impetuosity.</p>
               <p>"To be sure, so I did. I took the thing for thing for granted, seeing you so
                  earnest," replied the doctor; "but if you do succeed, I'm not a rich man, as you
                  know, but I'll willingly advance the money she will need to carry her there."</p>
               <p>"Only half, my good friend," said the vicar, grasping the doctor's hand, "only
                  half; I'll bear my share.</p>
               <p>"Be it so, then," returned the doctor.</p>
               <p>"And we can say," continued the vicar, "that we lend her the money, and that her
                  son will repay us some day, as he will, you know, if it ever lies in his
                  power."</p>
               <p>"Exactly," said the doctor; "Mrs. Dalton is very sensitive, and it won't do to
                  hurt her feelings."</p>
               <p>"Certainly not," returned the vicar; "but now, I think, I'd better write at once,
                  in time for the mail which leaves to-night."</p>
               <p>"I think so," said the doctor, and so it was arranged, and shortly after the
                  doctor took his leave.</p>
               <p>In three days the vicar received a letter from Mr. Davis in reply to his own. It
                  was satisfactory in every particular. The recommendation of Mr. Pearce," wrote Mr.
                  Davis, "was all that could be required." And, moreover, both the vicar and the
                  doctor were relieved from the expense their benevolence<pb n="150-151"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000076"/> was about to entail upon them, Mr. Davis
                  voluntarily taking it upon himself to defray the expenses of bringing the widow to
                  Abbotsford, where she was expected in a fortnight.</p>
               <p>This was just the space of time that yet remained to Gerald in Herrington, and the
                  same day that the letter was received from Mr. Davis, the vicar and the doctor
                  called together at Mrs. Dalton's lodgings, and told her the good, though
                  unexpected news, for Gerald had received strict injunctions not to mention to his
                  mother anything about the advertisement, lest expectations should be raised which
                  would not be realized.</p>
               <p>The prospect of the removal from Herrington and the keen sea air, to a quiet
                  village in one of the midland counties, was very grateful to the widow. She could
                  not sufficiently express her thanks to the kind friends who had so generously and
                  disinterestedly interfered in her behalf, and her obligations to the vicar were
                  further increased by his writing to Mr. Hoffman and obtaining permission for her
                  son to accompany her on her journey and see her quietly settled at Abbotsford.
                  Gerald had several interviews with his old friend, Jemmy Milton, during his stay
                  at Herrington. The few years that had passed over the old man's head since Gerald
                  left for London, had made no perceptible difference in his appearance. He was as
                  loquacious as ever, and as fond of the marvellous. Poor as he was, he took the
                  world lightly, and envied no man. But a great change had come over his brother,
                  the Deacon. He had lost his wife and his only son, and was now a lonely, wretched
                  old man, feeble in health, and more querulous than ever, while his avarice had
                  grown upon him to such an extent that wealthy as he was, he was said to deny
                  himself the commonest necessaries of life.</p>
               <p>"I am going away to-morrow, Jemmy," said Gerald, the day before Mrs. Dalton was to
                  leave for Abbotsford. He had met the old man on the beach, and knowing well that
                  nothing would please him better, he added:</p>
               <p>"I'll take a sail in your boat this afternoon, Jemmy. It may be long before I have
                  another opportunity."</p>
               <p>"With all my heart, Master Gerald," was the old fisherman's reply. "It's just I
                  was a going to ax you to do. But Lor' bless ye, don't say you'll never have
                  another opportunity. We'll have a plenty of sails together, yet please God. But
                  where are you a going to, back to Lunnun"</p>
               <p>"After I have seen my mother safely lodged in Abbotsford, Jemmy."</p>
               <p>"Then you be agoing with her? I'm main glad o' that. She'd feel awful lonesome
                  like going alone, by herself."</p>
               <p>"It's very kind of my employer to grant me permission," said Gerald," and still
                  kinder on the part of Mr. Pearce that he wrote to him to ask it."</p>
               <p>"Aye, Gerald, my boy; he's a good man, the parson. I wish there was a many like
                  him and Doctor Knight, and that all had lots of money. What a might sight of good
                  they'd do."</p>
               <p>"No doubt they would, Jemmy," said Gerald. "You're right there; but it's strange
                  that those who have the inclination to do the most good with money, are seldom
                  blessed with a superabundance of it."</p>
               <p>"Strange it is," returned the old fisherman; "but depend upon it it's all right.
                  Sarcumstances alters cases, and oftentimes a man who's got a heart as soft as a
                  soaked sea-biscuit while he's poor, grows to be as hard as a grindstone when he
                  gets rich. Why, I know'd a skipper once who sailed in the Portugal trade. He was
                  as good-hearted a man as ever trod a deck, and he used to complain of the grub the
                  owners put aboard for the men afore the mast, and to send 'em small stores out of
                  his own private stock, and he'd never let a chap want a chaw of 'bacca while he'd
                  got a roll of pig-tail or a stick of nigger-head left himself; but bym-by an old
                  uncle of his'n changed to die and leave him a brig of his own, and he turned out
                  arter'ards to be one of the skinniest old villains as ever sent a ship to sea
                  badly found. No, master Gerald, don't grumble at the ways o' Providence, but leave
                  it to its own actions<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7199-00000077"/> tions. It's the
                  poor you'll find, as is the best friends and has the feelingest hearts for the
                  poor."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you are right, Jemmy," replied Gerald; "but somehow or other it upset my
                  philosophy."</p>
               <p>"Then let philosophy alone, boy," said the old man, "and take to observation,
                  while you wait for experience, and when you gets to be as old as I be, you'll find
                  as Providence was right and philosophy wrong. But how do you like Lunnun? Of
                  course you've seed Wapping and Radcliffe Highway, and Limehouse and Poplar, and
                  all them parts? Ah! many's the jolly spree I've had there."</p>
               <p>"I have only once or twice visited the places you speak of," said Gerald; "and I
                  can't say they impressed me very favorably when I did visit them."</p>
               <p>"No!" exclaimed Jemmy, evidently very much surprised at what he considered
                  Gerald's want of taste. "But you've been to the top of the monument and inside St.
                  Paul's cathedral?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have," said Gerald.</p>
               <p>"And there was summit to see there?"</p>
               <p>"Undoubtedly they are worth a visit from a stranger, but I am busily occupied in
                  quite a distant part of the city, and during the three years I have been in London
                  have had little opportunity for sight-seeing, and little money to spend when I had
                  opportunity."</p>
               <p>"What sort of business are you employed in, may I ask?" said Jemmy.</p>
               <p>"I am employed in a warehouse, buying, selling, and arranging rubbish of all
                  kinds," replied Gerald.</p>
               <p>"Do you like that sort of work?" asked Jemmy.</p>
               <p>"Like it! I'm as sick and tired of it as I can well be," replied Gerald. "If it
                  wasn't for my mother's sake, I'd run, away and go to sea, or go to America, where
                  I was born, if I could, an try my fortune there."</p>
               <p>"The sea's a hard life," said the old man; "but I can't blame you, boy. It comes
                  hard to a lad of spirit to be wasting ing his time behind a counter. And then
                  there's fresh air and grand sights to be seen on the ocean, after all. But you're
                  right, boy, you're right, to think of the old woman. Don't go agin her, Gerry, if
                  you wants to have luck in this world, and to mount up'ards when your time
                  comes.'</p>
               <p>"I wish I could emigrate with my mother to the United States," said Gerald, in
                  reply.</p>
               <p>"Aye, that's a mighty fine country," said Jemmy; "I've been on that coast. That's
                  where the sea-sarpent cruises about."</p>
               <p>"The sea-serpent! What is that?" asked Gerald.</p>
               <p>"A great fish, half eel, half sarpent," replied Jemmy, "only a monstrous sight
                  bigger than any whale as ever spouted."</p>
               <p>"Did you ever come across it?" inquired Gerald, anticipating one of the old man's
                  yarns.</p>
               <p>"Aye, did I?" returned the old fisherman; "and I'd sooner fall in with an enemy's
                  line of battle ship, or encounter the heaviest gale that ever blowed, than fall in
                  with the sea-sarpent agin.'</p>
               <p>"How was it?" asked Gerald.</p>
               <p>"Why, d'ye see, I was second mate aboard one of the smartest little schooners that
                  ever traded between Halifax and New York. I'd been in her three v'yages, and on
                  the fourth, when we had been three days at sea from Halifax, and was every moment
                  expecting to see land, for we'd had a spanking run, just as night came on, it fell
                  calm, and the skipper took to swearing so awful that we thought some harm'd come
                  of it afore morning, and so there did. About eight bells, it being my morning
                  watch, I'd just relieved the chief mate, and was leaning over the taffrail,
                  watching the schooner, as she heaved up and down on the water, for there was a
                  great swell on, when I sees the cat's-paws astarn. I know'd as a breeze was a
                  comin', and I went down and called the skipper. Up he comes in a minute, but not
                  so fast as the breeze com'd up astarn.</p>
               <p>"'Set all sail,' he shouts; 'I'l drive her into port or into h—l, if the d—l's
                  after me before the day's out.'</p>

               <p>"You see, he'd a cargo of shingles aboard, that he expected to get a good market
                  for, for there was a demand for them in the States, and four other vessels was a
                  coming up only a few day's sail astarn, likewise with shingles aboard.</p>
               <p>"The breeze freshened up, as if the d—I had heard him, and was going to give us a
                  taste of his power, and by the time the sails were trimmed we were spanking along
                  full eight knots an hour, when, just as daylight began to glimmer in the sky, the
                  man at the wheel says to me—</p>
               <p>"'You'd better look out, make, that's a squall working up to leeward.'</p>
               <p>"I looked toward the direction he pointed out, and there, sure enough, was a cloud
                  rising, as black as thunder, and rushing towards us like a whirlwind.</p>
               <p>"'Let go the tops'l haliards,' I shouted out, without waiting for the skipper to
                  give the order.</p>
               <p>"'Keep all fast,' says he; 'don't stir tack or sheet, if it blows the d—I himself
                  and all his imps.' But he'd scarce got the words out of his mouth when down comes
                  the squall, takes the schooner all aback, carries away our sails clean out of the
                  bolt ropes, like as if they were so much tinder, and whips the foremast overboard
                  as if it had been a reed snapped asunder. Afore we had time to clear the wreck,
                  the squall had passed over, and the ship lay again almost becalmed on the
                  water.</p>
               <p>"'There's a Jonah aboard this here craft,' says the skipper, 'and I wish with all
                  my heart he was in the whale's belly. We've lost our chance of a good market for
                  the shingles now,' and he set to a swearin' agin as if he was possessed.</p>
               <p>"'Land ho!' calls out a man from the mast-head.</p>
               <p>"'Where away?' cries the skipper.</p>
               <p>"'Dead to leeward,' says the man.</p>
               <p>"'Dead to leeward be ——.' says the skipper, in a towerin' passion. 'There aint no
                  land within a thousand miles in that quarter.'</p>
               <p>"But sure enough there was a long, low, black ledge of rock, apparently,
                  stretching away for miles, the near point of it close to us, and we drifting right
                  upon it, for our rigging was hampered, and we had no command of the schooner's
                  helm. Presently, the skipper shouts out—</p>
               <p>"That aint no land, or my name ain't Peters, one or t'other,' says he, and we all
                  looked and seed the thing, whatever it was, though the glimmer—for it warnt yet
                  full daylight—a rearin' up its monstrous head and a openin' its jaws wide enough
                  to swallow down a hogshead without making two gulps, while faraway its body was a
                  writhin' like a snake, and the fins was a movin' in all directions, like as if it
                  was mad with fury.</p>
               <p>"'That the sea sarpent!' cries a chap from Nantucket, who'd seed the monster once
                  afore, and before any one had time to speak another word, he struck us with as
                  much force as if we'd run on a rock, staving in our larboard bulwarks and knocking
                  everything adrift on the deck.</p>
               <p>"Presently we shoved off, and found the schooner was filling with water. We had
                  just time to take to the boats and get clear of the wreck when she went down, head
                  foremost, for we had pig iron ballast aboard, and the shingles warn't no use to
                  keep her afloat. All the time there was the sea sarpent bobbin, and writhin' away
                  at a distance; but it didn't come in chase of us, as we feared, and fortunately it
                  had fallen quite calm agin, so we pulled away with all out might to give it a
                  clear berth. After a while we mustered the hands to see whether any one was a
                  missing, and, sure as fate, the skipper wasn't to be found; he was gone, with all
                  his sins upon his head.</p>
               <p>"We were picked up by a bring that came in hail about night-fall, and carried into
                  New York, and that's how I came to see the sea sarpent."</p>
               <p>"It might have been a sunken rock, not laid down in the charts, that you struck
                  the edge of," said Gerald. "I have read of such things."</p>
               <p>"So folks always says, who won't believe in special providences,' said Jemmy. "The
                  skipper of the brig he had<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7199-00000079"/> passed a
                  shelve of rock, with seaweed growing upon it, early in the morning, and he would
                  have it that was what we thought was the sea sarpent."</p>
               <p>"Most likely it was, Jemmy," said Gerald.</p>
               <p>"No, master Gerald, no. It was the sea serpent as sure as I' m Jemmy Milton, and
                  the moral of the story is, "don't call on the old 'un to help you, or p'raps he'll
                  take you at your word, and come when you don't want him"</p>
               <p>"A moral, as usual to your yarns, Jemmy," replied Gerald.</p>
               <p>"To be sure," said the old fisherman; "if there warn't a moral to be larnt, how
                  came the skipper to be the only man as was lost?"</p>
               <p>They were now approaching the pier, and shortly after they landed, and Gerald,
                  bidding the honest old man farewell, returned home to prepare for his journey on
                  the morrow.</p>
               <p>He found Dr. Knight and the vicar at the house, both of whom, notwithstanding the
                  generosity of Mr. Davis, insisted upon forcing a small sum of money on the widow,
                  to be paid by Gerald at some future day, and the vicar promised, should he receive
                  a letter from Mr. Ashley, giving any information respecting Alice Thornton, to let
                  Gerald and Mrs. Dalton know immediately.</p>
               <p>The tow gentlemen soon left them, after kind wishes had been mutually expressed,
                  and everything having been arranged for the journey in the morning, Mrs. Dalton
                  and Gerald retired for the night.</p>
               <p>At an early hour on the following day they were on their way to the widow's new
                  home at Abbotsford, at which place they arrived after a day and a night's travel.
                  Mrs. Dalton was kindly received by the rector, and lodged with her son in his
                  house, until her cottage was ready for her. Gerald remained just long enough to
                  see his mother comfortably installed in her new residence, and then he returned to
                  his employer in London.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Descriptive of Gerald's feelings when he returned to London.—Also of what Mr.
                     Ashley wrote from Ceylon.—And of a bright my which shed a light over Gerald's
                     gloomy prospects.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MORE moodily than ever did Gerald return to his duties in London after having seen
                  his mother comfortably settled at Abbottsford.</p>
               <p>Several times during his visit he had drawn his conversation with her to the
                  subject of going abroad, for, as he told her, he felt that without influential
                  friends to aid him and push him forward in England, he would be bowed down to
                  years, if not to a lifetime of drudgery. America, his native land, was the land of
                  his hopes, and there he wished to go; alone and unaided, if he could find no one
                  to assist him forward; and he built up flattering anticipations of the day, not
                  far distant, when he should be enabled to send for his mother to rejoin him there,
                  and live with her in a position of comparative affluence, such as she had been a
                  stranger to since the hapless hour when she bad first quitted her native shores.
                  But Mrs. Dalton lent an unwilling ear to his persuasions, Knowing, as she did, the
                  causes of the ill-success of her husband in the United states, she still shrunk
                  from the idea of her more energetic son going there alone and unbefriended, nor
                  would she listen to his expressed desire to seek his fortune elsewhere. Only one
                  concession could Gerald obtain; it was this: She would have no objection to his
                  going abroad, though<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7199-00000080"/> she would rather
                  that, while she lived, he remained in England, provided he went in some ostensible
                  situation. If he could procure that, she promised to give her consent; otherwise,
                  she charged him, with tears in her eyes, not to leave her, and Gerald, quite
                  overcome at the sight of her grief, promised that he would not.</p>
               <p>On one occasion Gerald introduced the subject of Mr. Brower's conversation in the
                  stage-coach during the journey from Liverpool to Derby, which had made such an
                  impression upon his memory at the time, young as he was, that he had never
                  forgotten it. But Mrs. Dalton treated the matter lightly. She had once, some years
                  before, written a letter, unknown to her friends, to the address of that gentleman
                  in Liverpool, and receiving no reply, (Mr. Brower, in fact, had returned to the
                  United States,) she had arrived at the conclusion that what he had said in regard
                  to the probable future value of the waste land, the title-deed of which she still
                  held, was merely one of the sanguine dreams in which she knew that Americans were
                  apt to indulge. Gerald said he should write to Cincinnati. He could do so, if he
                  pleased, was Mrs. Dalton's reply, but it would be useless; and Gerald did not
                  write.</p>
               <p>Four months passed away without any material change. At the expiration of that
                  period, Gerald received a letter from Mr. Pearce, inclosing one bearing the Ceylon
                  post-mark from Mr. Ashley.</p>
               <p>Gerald eagerly opened it, hoping that it might contain some news of Alice
                  Thornton, whose image, since her singular disappearance, as it was supposed with
                  the mysterious stranger, though others thought she had fallen accidentally from
                  the perpendicular cliffs into the sea beneath, had ever been present to his
                  memory; or at least hoping that it would furnish some account of her parentage,
                  for neither he nor Mrs. Dalton knew more than that she was the daughter of a
                  fellow-student of Mr. Ashley's, whom he had protected since her father's
                  decease.</p>
               <p>The letter was addressed to Gerald. (It appeared that a packet had been received
                  from Mr. Ashley containing letters for Mr. Pearce, Dr. Knight, and Mrs. Dalton and
                  her son.) It ran as follows:</p>

                              Although we know that many changes may have taken place since the
                              letters we receive four months after they were written were penned,
                              still, for the time being, their perusal seems to unite us together
                              again. None can know, but those who are separated by so many thousand
                              leagues of ocean, how fondly we gaze upon the well-known hand-writing,
                              and how we treasure every kind expression—every proof that we are not
                              forgotten by those, still so dear to <emph>us,</emph> whom we have so
                              long parted from. It is only after we have read them and talked over
                              them again and again, that we recollect that amidst the continual
                              changes that are occurring, things may be very different at the time
                              we read from what they were when our friends wrote. Let us hope,
                              however, that at least matters have not changed for the worse, and
                              comfort ourselves with the knowledge that there is a kind Providence
                              watching over us all, and that whatever occurs, we are in its care,
                              and under its guidance.</p>
                           <p>"I have learned with great pleasure that you are so happily situated

                  say so if he knew how I detest sticking day after day in this dull shop." But he
                  read on.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"I am also glad to hear that your mother, and yourself and all my kind friends
                     in Herrington were well at the date of the writing. My earnest hope, and that
                     of your aunt and cousins, is, that you still remain so.</p>
                  <p>"We are very comfortable here. It is a delightful place to<pb n="160-161"
                        xml:id="VAC7199-00000081"/> reside in. If we had only our friends in England
                     with us, we should be quite contented to spend the remainder of our lives here.
                     We are living in a very pretty and commodious 'bungalow,' (that, Gerald, is the
                     name they give to what you would term a villa in England.) Our place is about
                     three miles from the city of Columbo. I am at the head of a Government school
                     establishment, and I have about two hundred native children, boys and girls, to
                     instruct. Of course, I am assisted by several teachers, only two of whom are
                     English; the others are native Cingalese; but they make excellent instructors,
                     and the children are, generally speaking, very apt and docile. All are, at
                     least nominally, Christians. I have almost perfectly mastered the Cingalese
                     language, which is by no means difficult to attain by careful study. Your
                     cousins, Frederick and Henry, both speak it well enough to converse with ease
                     with the natives, though many of these speak English intelligibly and all the
                     children in the school learn English. Your aunt, however, does not succeed at
                     all in acquiring the Cingalese language, and she has consequently great
                     difficulty in managing the servants.</p>
                  <p>"By the way, speaking of Frederick and Henry—they are grown to be quite young
                     men now—I must tell you that they have become quite adepts at hunting, not
                     hares and rabbits, and foxes, and the small game you hunt in England, but elks
                     and wild boars, with which the country abounds. Frederick has been once at an
                     elephant hunt, and though the sport is somewhat dangerous he was highly
                     delighted with the excursion, which enabled him to see a great deal of the
                     beautiful country. I have a promise from the bishop to procure Frederick, who
                     has been studying medicine out here, an appointment as assistant surgeon on
                     board one of the East India Company's cruisers. He is delighted with the
                     prospect, Henry assists me in the school. The girls are quite well, and growing
                     nicely. All your cousins, with their mother, unite with me in sending you the
                     kindest regards. I must not forget to inform you that you have two other
                     cousins, twins, both girls, born since we have lived here. My little Cingalese
                     pets, I call them."</p>

               <p>Gerald could not forbear a smile as he thought how the very few little
                  disagreements that used to occur between his uncle and aunt were generally on
                  account of his aunt's jealousy respecting the first pair of twins. But since now
                  their circumstances appeared changed for the better, he thought, perhaps, the
                  cause of that needless jealousy on the part of his aunt was removed and again he
                  resumed his reading.</p>

                              little Alice. Mr. Pearce wrote me the particulars, and spoke of a
                              gentleman who is suspected to have been in some mysterious way
                              instrumental in her abduction. That gentleman was a Mr. Craddock.</p>
                           <p>"He never directly told me so, and yet I have some reason to believe
                              that he has been an officer in the Indian army. He has friends or
                              relations in the United States or Canada, and talked of visiting them
                              after he had visited England. He spoke several times of Mr. Thornton,
                              Alice's father, my old college chum Hackney, and said he had known him
                              as a boy, and had been much attached to him, but having quitted
                              England for America at an early age, and subsequently resided in
                              India, they had never met after their schoolboy days. He knew,
                              however, that poor Thornton had married, and that his wife had died:
                              also, that he had left a daughter in my charge.</p>
                           <p>"He had seen my name mentioned as having been appointed to this
                              school, in one of the Calcutta newspapers, and that, he said, was the
                              reason that he visited Ceylon before he returned to England. He
                              thought that the daughter of his old school-fellow might perhaps have
                              come to Ceylon with my family, and he much wished to see her. He made
                              many enquiries respecting her, and that was the way I came to give him
                              a letter<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7199-00000082"/> of introduction to
                              Mr. Pearce. I thought he might wish to serve poor little Alice, and I
                              had reason to believe that he was a man of considerable wealth. In
                              manners and appearance he was thoroughly a gentleman, and a man
                              apparently of education and of great intelligence. He had evidently
                              travelled much, and talked, after visiting America, of returning again
                              to the <emph>East Indies,</emph> I had some suspicion that he was a
                              relative of Alice's, and once I asked him the question.</p>
                           <p>"He replied evasively, and I made no further inquiry. These several
                              circumstances lead me strongly to suspect that he is in fact privy to
                              Alice's disappearance, and that the poor child did not meet with any
                              fatal accident, as Mr. Pearce partially hints might have been the
                              case. I trust it is so, and that we shall hear of our dear little girl
                              again, for I do not think, from the appearance of Mr. Craddock, that
                              he is a man who would harm the <emph>child.</emph> There is some
                              mystery in the matter which time will perhaps disclose. Let us hope,
                              at least, that it will.</p>
                           <p>"I have written Mr. Pearce more fully in relation to these matters. He
                              asked for some information regarding Mr. Thornton. I have none to
                              furnish him with beyond the facts I have already stated to you. I
                              don't think poor Thornton had any relations in England. His wife was a
                              Spanish lady from the island of Cuba, and she died shortly after Alice
                              was born, and poor Thornton, who died when Alice was only three years
                              old, left her, on his death-bed, to my care. I promised him faithfully
                              that she should be to me as a daughter, and I feel that I am to blame
                              in having parted with her, although under the circumstances it was
                              unavoidable.</p>
                           <p>"Let me hope, however, that when next I hear from you, you may have
                              heard some good tidings of the dear lost one, or that she has been
                              restored to you; that hope is all that is left.</p>
                           <p>"I have written you a long letter, my dear nephew, and must now close.
                              I have been writing to your mother, and Mr. Pearce and yourself, the
                              greater portion of this day.</p>
                           <p>"God bless you, Gerald. I could wish that you and your mother were out
                              here with us. You are doubtless contented at home; but there are
                              opportunities out her for young men, far superior to those to be found
                              in England, especially if they have no partonage to advance their
                              interests.</p>

               <p>Gerald read this letter amid a variety of conflicting feelings. He was glad to
                  hear that his uncle and the family were so happily situated in their far off home
                  in the Cinnamon Isle: but it was with impatient regret that he read that portion
                  of the letter which alluded to his supposed happiness and contentment in England.
                  He heard with feelings akin to jealousy of his cousin's promised appointment in
                  the East India Company's navy, and it was with deep sorrow, not however unmixed
                  with hope, that he read the part which alluded to Alice Thornton. But the
                  information respecting Mr. Craddock, while it disabused his mind of the suspicious
                  he had partially entertained, that some dreadful accident had befallen her, seemed
                  to render her disappearance a matter of greater mystery than ever. He now had not
                  the slightest doubt that she had been carried away by Mr. Craddock; but why the
                  affair had been effected so secretly; why Alice had not come home and informed her
                  friends; or rather why Mr. Craddock had not done so, and given some reason for his
                  strange action towards her, was a mystery he could not fathom. Again, the letter
                  gave no clue whatever to the whereabouts of Mr. craddock. He might be in Canada,
                  or the United States, or perhaps in Cuba, or he might have returned to the East
                  Indies!</p>
               <p>Poor Gerald! he was more in a maze, and more discontented and wretched than
                  ever.</p>
               <p>At length a gleam of hope shed its bright rays over his prospects. Mr. Hoffman,
                  who was really greatly attached<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7199-00000083"/> the
                  youth, was well aware, although Gerald had never complained in his hearing and had
                  always striven to appear cheerful and contended, that he longed for some more
                  active employment. Mr. Hoffman was, as the reader is well aware, a somewhat
                  eccentric individual. One of his characteristics was that he never appeared to
                  take any active interest in any one. He blamed severely when blame was merited,
                  but it was a maxim with him never to praise any one for doing their duty. That he
                  considered every body was bound to do so, and although he had written to Mr.
                  Pearce in high terms of Gerald's conduct, the only means the young man possessed
                  of knowing that his employer was satisfied with his behavior, beyond what the
                  vicar had intimated to him was, that he seldom or never found fault with him.</p>
               <p>He had some strange speculative fancies, and was forever contriving some novel
                  scheme to advance his fortunes, and it was a singular proof of his tact and
                  foresight that amidst the multiplicity of his business he rarely failed in
                  anything he undertook.</p>
               <p>One evening about three months after Gerald had received the letter from his
                  uncle, just as he had put up the shutters and was about closing the shop for the
                  night, Mr. Hoffman told him that he wished to see him in his library, an old
                  fashioned apartment, which he dignified by that name, and in which he had
                  collected, as a stranger would have thought, al the old, odd volumes that he could
                  pick up at the old bookstores or in the auction rooms of London.</p>
               <p>Gerald promised to attend, and a few minutes after, wondering what could be the
                  cause of the unwonted summons, he went up stairs to the apartment, and tapping at
                  the door was requested to come in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hoffmann was seated at a table with an old lamp before him, a relic of ancient
                  times that he had picked up somewhere in the course of his perigrinations, and
                  which might have been manufactures for some monkish cloister in the Middle
                  Ages.</p>
               <p>He was busily examining a file of papers, seemingly accounts of sales and similar
                  documents.</p>
               <p>"Ah! it's you? take a seat, Gerald," he said, as the young man entered.</p>
               <p>Gerald did as he was requested. For some minutes the old gentleman continued his
                  examination of the file of papers; then folding them up methodically, and
                  carefully laying them aside, he said bluntly, "Gerald, you are not satisfied with
                  your situation here."</p>
               <p>"Really, sir," stammered the young man, "I-I-I—"</p>
               <p>"Don't prevaricate, sir; there is nothing I detest so much as prevarication," said
                  the old gentleman. "Above all things I like candor. I have observed for a long
                  time past, nay, I may say, ever since the first year that you came here, that the
                  situation you hold in my employ is one that is distasteful to you."</p>
               <p>"I could certainly wish for some more active employment, sir," said Gerald; "I
                  could wish also for some employment in which I could do something for my mother;
                  but I can conscientiously say that since I have been in your employ I have done my
                  duty as far as lay in my power."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes," returned the old gentleman; "you have done your duty, and it was your
                  duty to do it. I have no fault to find with you for that, neither do you deserve
                  any praise for it. We are all sent into the world to do our duty towards each
                  other—you have done yours towards me; it is now my turn to do mine towards
                  you."</p>
               <p>Gerald sat silent, not knowing indeed how to reply, and greatly wondering what the
                  old gentleman meant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hoffman continued:—</p>
               <p>"I say it is now my turn to do my duty towards you. You are quite right in wishing
                  to assist your mother now, at your time of life. That is a very material part of
                  your duty; you might have done so before—I might have put you in the way of doing
                  so, but to no good purpose while you were so young. You never would have got
                  forward in the world if you had been left to yourself at too early an age.</p>
               <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7199-00000084"/>
               <p>"Now you have been thoroughly trained in my shop. You have had to stick close to a
                  business that you did not fancy, and to bear confinement, because as a boy who had
                  his own fortune to carve out in the world, it was your duty to bear with that
                  which was distasteful to you, if by so doing you could serve the interests of your
                  employers and gain friends that might be of service to you thereafter."</p>
               <p>"I am grateful for the good opinion you have of me, sir," said Gerald.</p>
               <p>"I did not say that I had any special good opinion of you," continued the old
                  gentleman. "You have done your duty so far, and I hope you will continue to do it
                  as faithfully throughout your life. You want more active employment, and if I
                  don't mistake you will have no objection to see a little of the world outside of
                  smoky London. I want the services of an active, trustworthy young man to go
                  abroad. Are you willing to accept the offer I am about to make to you? If so, the
                  matter is settled."</p>
               <p>Gerald's heart leaped to his throat at the idea of going abroad, whither, he cared
                  little. He thought of his mother at Abbottsford; but then he recollected that she
                  had promised to give her consent, should he at any time meet with a situation of
                  responsibility and trust.</p>
               <p>"I think I am willing and ready to accept any offer you may make me, sir," he
                  replied; "but you have not yet told me what it is you have in view."</p>
               <p>"No! to be <emph>sure.</emph> I <emph>have</emph> not. I was forgetting
                     <emph>my</emph> duty, young man, in hurrying on so fast. Well, then, the matter
                  I have in view is this. I have, as you know, a large collection of old and
                  valuable engravings and paintings, and a variety of knick knacks of various
                  descriptions, which I have been informed will sell to great advantage in the East
                  Indies, where there is a demand now for such things. I was thinking of sending
                  them there. My friend, Mr. Grimsby, the tobacconist, also has been talking to me
                  about the feasibility of establishing an agency in Calcutta for the sale of his
                  celebrated eye snuff. You know he has agencies in almost every part of the world.
                  I have spoken to him concerning you, and he is desirous of entrusting you with the
                  task. Another friend of mine is also about to send a large quantity of hardware to
                  the East Indies, and I have talked with several gentlemen besides who are sending
                  goods out in the same ship, about employing you as supercargo. Would you like to
                  undertake the responsibility?"</p>
               <p>"I can never be sufficiently grateful," replied Gerald, who was quite elated at
                  the prospect opened to him.</p>
               <p>"There is nothing to be grateful for," returned the old gentleman. "You have a
                  certain duty entrusted to you, and you will oblige us in doing it properly, to the
                  best of your ability, as we shall oblige you by sending you out in charge of our
                  goods."</p>
               <p>"I shall certainly do all that lies in my power to serve you," said Gerald, "and I
                  most cheerfully accent your offer."</p>
               <p>"Well, then," said the old gentleman, "We will consider the matter settled. I knew
                  very well, beforehand, that you would jump at the offer, and engaged another
                  shopman in your place. You can run down to Abbottsford and see your mother, if you
                  like. Start to-morrow if you can get ready. The ship sails in three weeks; you
                  must be back in a fortnight from to-morrow and then direct all your attention to
                  your new duties."</p>
               <p>Gerald assured the old gentleman that he should be ready to start for Abbottsford
                  on the following morning, and thus be the bearer in his own person, to his mother,
                  of his rising prospects; and Mr. Hoffmann, considering in his off-hand way that
                  all the preliminaries had been settled, closed the interview.</p>
               <p>Gerald retired to his room; but not to sleep. His thoughts were too much occupied
                  with the prospect, so long and so earnestly desired, that had now so strangely
                  opened to him; bright visions of the future passed rapidly before him, while at
                  the same time thoughts of his mother and of the way in which she would receive
                  the, to him, gratifying intelligence, would recur to his mind; but he flattered
                  himself that the first regret over, she would rejoice with him over his good
                  fortune.</p>
               <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7199-00000085"/>
               <p>It was far in the night ere he closed his eyes, and then he dreamed of startling
                  and perilous adventures in the East; of Vishnoo and Bramah, and the Car of
                  Juggernaut, and Hindoo temples and cinnamon groves; and of all the marvels of the
                  "Arabian Nights," and of tiger and elephant hunts in Ceylon, and of all he had
                  read or heard of the land of gorgeous romance—the rich and gorgeous land of the
                  East. And yet when he awoke in the morning, so restless had been his slumbers,
                  that it still wanted an hour to his usual time of rising.</p>
               <p>He sprang from his bed and commenced to make preparations for his journey to
                  Abbottsford. He was soon ready, and after having partaken of a hasty breakfast, he
                  bade a temporary farewell to Mr. and Mrs. Hoffman and with a light heart walked to
                  the coach office and was soon being borne towards Huntingdonshire as rapidly as
                  four horses could carry him.</p>
               <p>It was late in the evening when he reached St. Ives, from which place he had to
                  walk the distance of two miles to Abbottsford, at which place he arrived just as
                  Mrs. Dalton was preparing to retire to rest. She was overjoyed to see her son. The
                  visit was of course quite unexpected, and after the first mutual congratulations
                  were over, Gerald lost no time in acquainting her with the object of his visit,
                  and of his anticipated departure from India. Sorely as Mrs. Dalton grieved at the
                  idea of his leaving her, and tempting the dangers of the sea and the perils of a
                  foreign clime—dangers and perils much exaggerated by her too vivid imagination—she
                  had too much good sense to raise any objections to a course which promised to be
                  of so much advantage to her son, and indeed to her also, for Mr. Hoffmann, before
                  Gerald's departure in the morning, had informed him that his salary would be
                  liberal, so she gladly yet tearfully gave her full consent. Long after the widow's
                  usual hour of retiring, did she and Gerald sit in earnest conversation that night
                  and the hour of midnight had passed away before the widow and her son retired to
                  rest.</p>
               <p>On the following morning, Gerald wrote to his friend the Vicar of Herrington, and
                  to Dr. Knight, to inform them of his good fortune; and he also wrote a few lines
                  to his old friend and companion, Jemmy Milton, whom he was well aware would be as
                  happy to hear of his rising prospects, and especially that he was going to see the
                  world—a favorite expression of the old fisherman's—as was he himself.</p>
               <p>Letters in reply were duly received from Dr. Knight and the Vicar, congratulating
                  the young man on his prospects, and also a letter from Jemmy Milton; but this last
                  being a curiosity in its way, shall occupy a place in the following chapter.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Jemmy Milton gives Gerald some good advice in a letter.—And Gerald takes
                     possession of an invoice of rare and curious merchandise, to do the best he can
                     therewith.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>JEMMY MILTON'S letter was written on a sheet of superfine Bath post paper,
                  gilt-edged; but the glories of the white smooth sheet were somewhat dimmed by the
                  awkward, square method which had been adopted in folding it, and by the sprawling
                  seal of pitch, stamped with a thumb mark; nevertheless, it was with no little
                  gratification that Gerald received this proof of his old favorite's regard for
                  him, for he knew that nothing but the strongest feeling of friendship could have
                  put the idea of sending a letter into Jemmy's head.</p>
               <p>The letter was not dated. Jemmy probably did not think it worth while to brother
                  himself with such trifling conventionalities as dates, but commenced at once in
                  the most approved and time-honored style of syntax, to wit:</p>

                           <p>"This comes hopping to find you well, as it leaves me at present. I
                              have got a chum, Tom Fletcher, as you are acquainted with, seeing as
                              you've often met him in the boathouse 'long o' me, to write this here
                              letter, cos it's so long since I tuk a pen in my hands, never since I
                              larned down strokes and hooks and hangers at dame's school, that
                              writing 'ud come arkard to me now; besides, my fingers is grow'd too
                              stiff; but Tom can write like schoolmaster. He would make me put this
                              in, thof I didn't want to, Master Gerald. I heered yesterday terday
                              from Mr. Pearce, who I met a walking on the pier, as how you was a
                              going to the Injees to seek your fortin. Good luck to you, my boy, and
                              I hope you'll find it, as I ain't got no doubt as you will, if you
                              seeks it arter the right fashion, and follers the advice as you've had
                              larnt you by the vicar, and your mother and me. Jemmy don't know where
                              Injee is seeing that he has never been there any more than me; but
                              it's a long way off, no doubt—may be in China—may be 'tother side of
                              'Merrica; but wheresomever it be, I know as it's a mighty fine place,
                              full of goold, diamonds and precious stones, for we've read that 'ere

                              the way, and many a fine lad's been wrecked on 'em for want o' keeping
                              a bright look out. Above all, Gerald, my boy, don't be tempted by the
                              marmaids; you've come to an age, now, when you're like to be 'tacted

                               avoid 'em, boy; take am old man's advice and give 'em a wide
                              berth, as a good skipper would a lee shore on a dark night, though
                              there's syringes on shore as well as at sea. They are the strange
                              women that King Soloman speaks on in the Book of Proverbs, who have
                              cast dpwn many wounded, and I have seen many strong men slain by 'em.
                              Sarch the Scripturs for that 'ere text, Gerald, my boy. When you gets
                              to Injee, may be you'll larn summat of poor little Alice. The vicar
                              tells me as how Mr. Ashley ain't seed nought on her, and dont't know
                              the genelman in black as tuk her away. In old times there used to live
                              lots o' giants and ogres, and wizards as used to run away with
                              beautiful maids and keep 'em in captivity till some adventurous knight
                              like Jack the Gaint Killer or King Arthur of the Round Table conquered
                              'em and restored the maiden to her friends, when in coorse the gallant
                              knight married the lady, and they had a regular jolly time on't. I've
                              read that 'ere in books as long ago as I can recollect, and I oncet

                              I'm thinkin' you won't mind the penalty of splicing the lass for your
                              trouble. Jemmy Milton wishes me to present his best respects to your
                              mother, and I'm glad to larn from the vicar that she in so nicely
                              settled in Abbottsford, where the vicar says she is gone to.</p>
                           <p>"Mayhap you'd like to hear some'at about the old place, seeing it'll
                              p'raps be many years afore you see it agin—and then I and Tom, too,
                              will p'raps have shipped on our last v'yage to etarnity. Last Monday
                              was quarter day, and as usual we had a jolly time arter I drew my
                              quarter's pay from my brother, the deacon, and what d'ye think,
                              Gerald; they got up a surprise for me while I was gone up to get the
                              rhino. I knows as how Tom Fletcher was at the head of it. Cos it's
                              just like him. I was'nt though; it was a regular round robin among us
                              all; but Jemmy will have it so, and insists upon my writing it down.
                              He'll spell through the letter arterards, so in it goes: they'd been
                              and guv the old boat-house a fresh coat of coal tar, and painted the
                              door and winder frames green, and put in a new bench and two new
                              stools. I hardly know'd the old place again, it looked so comfortable
                              and cosy, and Tom Fletcher stood a keg of hollands' hisself—I did;
                                 <emph>that's true;</emph> and didn't we have a merry night on't! We
                              got so happy talkin of old times; and you was'nt forgotten, Gerald,
                              nor your uncle, nor your mother, that it being late afore the keg's
                              was empty, we reckoned as we would'nt go home till morning, and so we
                              slept in the boat-house, and when we woke up in the morning, we was
                              all layin under the table and about the floor, in all sorts o' rum
                              attitoodes. Gerald, my boy, let me give you one more piece of advice,
                              in which Tom Fletcher jines—so I do, with all my heart: don't give way
                              to drink when you gets to Injee; I'm told they drinks awful there, and
                              poisons theirselves with liquor and then lays it tot the climate;
                              recollect the yarn I oncet told you, that had the moral at the tail

                           <p>My brother, the deacon, is a growin' more miserly than ever. He half
                              starves hisself so as to save his money; though what he's agoin' to do
                              with it I don't know, since when he dies he bain't got chick nor child
                              to leave it to. God bless you, Gerald; and pilot you safe over the
                              stormy ocean and bring you safe back home agin—so no more at present

               <p>Gerald was much amused with this letter, although he found some difficulty in
                  deciphering it, as much on account of the false orthography as from the ambiguous
                  phraseology. He wrote a reply, assuring the old man that he should strive not to
                  forget him nor his teachings, and should take especial care to avoid being seduced
                  by the siren voices of the mermaids he might fall in with in his voyage. He also
                  replied to the letters he had received from his other friends at Herrington, and
                  wrote to his uncle informing him that he was about to visit the East Indies, and
                  as it was optionable with him to return home on board any vessel he pleased—if he
                  found that it wouldn't occupy too much of his time, he should visit Columbo.</p>
               <p>Time, on the occasion of such a visit as this that Gerald had paid his mother,
                  always flies swiftly: the fortnight soon expired, and greatly to his mother's
                  grief, though she strove to hide it, and indeed to his own deep regret when the
                  hour of parting came, Gerald returned to London</p>
               <p>On his arrival at Board street, he discovered that, as is usually the case, the
                  vessel would not sail at the time appointed, and that it would be at least three
                  weeks before her lading would be completed. However, this was little time enough
                  for him to make himself acquainted with the duties that would be required of him,
                  of which, to say the truth, he knew very little.</p>
               <p>Just at this time, the East India Company had opened a new territory, as they had
                  often done before, have done since, and will do again, so long as an inch of
                  ground remains in the possession<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7199-00000088"/>
                  session of the Native Rajahs. Joshua was the first fillibuster on record, who felt
                  himself constrained to fulfil a "manifest destiny;" but he has been improved upon
                  since, and by none of his imitators with greater effect than by the Honorable East
                  India Company, which is perpetually finding itself called upon to conquer the
                  natives surrounding its broad lands, and teach them the blessings of civilization
                  and religion, thereby adding by this good work greatly to its own influence,
                  wealth and prosperity.</p>
               <p>There had been a time of severe commercial distress in India, but the crisis had
                  passed away, and with the acquisition of new territory a reaction had taken place,
                  and speculation was rife. The mania had reached England, and merchants and
                  tradesmen of every class were looking towards the East, with all the eagerness
                  that in later years they have looked towards California and South Australia. Every
                  body who had any business that could be extended abroad, was sending goods and
                  establishing agencies in India.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hoffmann, like most London tradesmen, belonged to a club, composed of
                  tradesmen like himself, or rather he and a dozen others of his class were
                  accustomed to meet together nightly in the back parlor of a snug public house, and
                  there to talk over business and politics, while they smoked their pipes and sipped
                  their hot brandy and water.</p>
               <p>Naturally enough, a short time before Mr. Hoffmann had spoken to Gerald relative
                  to going abroad, the conversation at one of these nightly meetings had turned upon
                  India, and the opportunities that offered themselves of making money there.</p>
               <p>"I should'nt mind sending out a venture," said one, laying aside his long clay
                  pipe, and looking solemnly round at the company, "provided I knew how to manage
                  it. I should think a dozen cases or so of English pickles and hams, and such like
                  articles would sell well just now. The officers, you see, will be going with their
                  families to the new territory, and they will be glad to purchase such luxuries,
                  and pay a high price for them too, I'll be bound."</p>
               <p>"No doubt of it, neighbor Feldwick, no doubt of it," observed Mr. Grimsby, the
                  celebrated tobacconist and snuff manufacturer, addressing his friend who had first
                  spoken, who was in the "Oil and Italian" line. "And I have a great idea that my
                  eye snuff would make me a small fortune, if I could establish an agency in India.
                  The Opthalmia, I understand, is very prevalent in the sandy plains of the East.
                  I've had serious thoughts of attempting such a thing."</p>
               <p>"Cheap, gay calicoes are in great request amongst the half naked savages of newly
                  opened territories, I have been told," chimed in a Manchester warehouseman. "The
                  market is dull here just now, and I have several cases of unsaleable goods in my
                  warehouse. I shouldn't wonder if I made a good job by sending them to India. Might
                  perhaps establish a permanent trade there."</p>
               <p>Several others spoke to a like purport. Mr. Hoffmann had said nothing; but he had
                  continued smoking sagely, and was thinking deeply. He had several boxes of copper
                  plates of old engraving, and books upon books of old engravings taken from the
                  copper plates, which he picked up at the sale of the effects of a virtuoso several
                  years before, and these had been lying unsaleable and lumbering up his store-rooms
                  ever since. He might, he thought, dispose of them in India. No doubt the officers
                  and civilians about to establish themselves in the new territory would like to
                  carry with them reminiscences of the arts and refinements of home: besides he had
                  many other articles useless in London, which might be disposed of advantageously
                  abroad.</p>
               <p>The whole party, having given expression to these sentiments, sat for some time
                  smoking in solemn silence. was at length broken by Mr. Grimsby:—</p>
               <p>"I will, by George," he said, striking his fist upon the table, with a force that
                  set all the glasses ringing.</p>
               <p>"And so will I," said Mr. Feldwick, the Oil and Italian warehouseman, accompanying
                  the assertion with a similar forcible demonstration.</p>
               <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7199-00000089"/>
               <p>"Gentlemen," observed Mr. Hoffmann—he was the only person present who had not
                  hitherto spoken—"I should like to join you. We may make up a venture between us;
                  but there is one requisite that you seem to have forgotten."</p>
               <p>"What is that?" cried half a dozen at once.</p>
               <p>"We shall want somebody to look after our joint stock. If we ship it to India
                  without having made this provision, among the vast quantity of goods going there
                  just now it will stand a chance of being overlooked; at any rate it is not likely
                  to be establishing agencies abroad, some one must be deputed to act in such
                  transactions,"</p>
               <p>"To be sure; you are quite right, neighbor Hoffman," said the tobacconist; "but
                  who can we get. Do you know of any suitable persons? A young man, for instance,
                  who will undertake the duties of a supercargo, cheap?"</p>
               <p>"I think I do," returned Mr. Hoffmann. "You know my young man, Gerald Dalton,
                  friend Grimsby? The lad has a great desire to go abroad, and he is a good lad, and
                  may be trusted."</p>
               <p>"And he will be reasonable as to salary?" said Mr. Grimsby.</p>
               <p>"Yes. perfectly so. We will give him a small commission on the sales, and a trifle
                  of salary besides. What do you say gentlemen, to our clubbing a venture, and
                  sending Gerald out with it?" said Mr. Hoffmann, addressing his friends around the
                  table, all of whom had been listening attentively to the conversation that had
                  passed between him and Mr. Grimsby.</p>
               <p>"I like the idea, for one," said the Manchester warehouseman.</p>
               <p>"And I," said another, and another, and before the party separated that night it
                  was arranged that each should contribute a portion of a common "venture," to be
                  placed under the care of Gerald Dalton, by him to be sold in the East Indies to
                  the best advantage.</p>
               <p>In a very few days after this arrangement the goods to sent were picked out and
                  packed, and it having been ascertained that the Seringapatam Indiaman would sail
                  in a few weeks for Calcutta and that she yet had room for a considerable amount of
                  cargo, sufficient freight accommodation was secured on board her; and then Mr.
                  Hoffmann, who was well aware that Gerald would be glad of the opportunity that
                  would be thus afforded him of seeing the world, spoke to him on the subject in the
                  manner I have heretofore related.</p>
               <p>The period that had yet to elapse before the Indiaman was to sail, was spent by
                  Gerald in making himself acquainted, us far as lay in his power, with the nature
                  of a supercargo's duties. He did not fear that he would find them very difficult,
                  still he had little or no notion of trade, and it was his earnest desire to render
                  a satisfactory account to his employers on his return.</p>
               <p>It had been settled that he was to receive a small per cent-age on the sales that
                  should be made, and a salary of fifty pounds and his passage out to India and back
                  again secured. Twenty pounds out of the fifty he resolved should go to his mother;
                  the other thirty he would probably have ample necessity for himself. In addition
                  to this, if he were very successful in his undertaking, he was to receive a bonus,
                  according to the liberality of his employers, at the termination of the
                  voyage.</p>
               <p>Twenty pounds were paid him in advance, to aid in supplying his outfit.</p>
               <p>It was a curiously heterogeneous collection of goods that he found himself in
                  charge of when the day of shipment arrived: perhaps never supercargo before had
                  been placed in charge of a more singular selection of marketables, or
                  unmarketables, as the venture might prove, and the articles were invoiced at
                  almost fabulous prices, so sanguine were the senders of the demand for goods of
                  all kinds that would exist in India.</p>
               <p>The following is a copy of the invoice that was presented to the young man, after
                  the goods had all been shipped.</p>

               <p>"Queer articles of merchandise, some of them" muttered Gerald to himself as he
                  read over the invoice. "But I suppose they'll find a ready sale in India, or they
                  wouldn't send them out. Let me see," and he cast up the separate invoices (Of
                  course the estimated value in London was not known to him.) "Mr. Grimsby, ¥112
                  10s.," marking the amount down in pencil on the margin of the invoice. "A small
                  venture that of old Grimsby's; but eye-snuff enough, I should think, to supply the
                  East Indies with the article for a quarter of a century; but then the old chap
                  counts on getting an agency for the whole East established. Well, we'll see. What
                  next?"</p>
               <p>Again he summed up.</p>
               <p>"Messrs. Feldwick &amp; Co., ¥760. That's something more respectable, but a droll
                  assortment. What the mischief can they want with so many clasp-knives in India?
                  They must be quite out of the article. Ha! Atkins, ¥2,580," marking down the
                  amount. "That's something like. Then there's old Dawson, 291 10s.; moderate again.
                  And Dobbs, ¥131; still more moderate. Then comes Mr. Hoffmann. What's he sent, I
                  wonder? Good gracious!" he exclaimed, looking over the articles enumerated, "what
                  on earth will they de with them in India? I suppose, though, it's all right—¥866
                  8s. That amounts, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">in toto,</foreign>" adding up, "to
                  ¥4,741 8s., and my discount, 7 per cent. on the sales, provided I don't get higher
                  prices than they are invoice at, which I ought certainly to do, will amount to
                  ¥330, and ¥30 to receive when I return, for salary, ¥360; quite a fortune! Hurrah!
                  Why, I shall be a rich man all at once. Won't I go down to Abbottsford and make
                  mother all right? And then, if I <emph>should</emph> fall in with Alice, or hear
                  anything of her! It would be glorious!"</p>
               <p>He sat for some time thinking of the past and dreaming of the future, till
                  suddenly recollecting that it was getting late, and he had to be up betimes in the
                  morning to meet Mr. Hoffmann, and had several letters to write to his friends, as
                  the mail was to leave Calcutta on the following Thursday. (It was now Monday); he
                  rose from his reverie, and taking his candle retired to rest.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>In which it is told how Gerald went to India, and what occurred during the
                     voyage, and after he arrived at Calcutta. Also details of many other
                     interesting incidents.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ALL was now ready for sea on board the Seringapatam East Indiaman. The ship had
                  handled out of the East India dock, and lay in the stream opposite Blackwell,
                  awaiting the captain's return from the city, and passengers and seamen were
                  hurrying on board, having, as is ever the case, waited till the last moment.</p>
               <p>Gerald had written his last letters home, for a long time, at any rate, and had
                  requested that the replies to these letters might be addressed to him at the
                  ship's consignees at Calcutta, at the same time promising himself to write thence.
                  The day before, he had held his parting interview with Mr. Hoffmann, and was now
                  busily occupied in arranging the narrow stateroom that he was to occupy during the
                  voyage. This was not a very difficult task, inasmuch as there was a room for
                  nothing but a small trunk, besides the state-room furniture, consisting of a
                  fixture bed-place, a camp stool, and a ledge with a hole in it for the reception
                  of a ewer and basin: so this task completed he went on deck to escape the
                  confusion in the cabin, though there was little to gain by the movement, for the
                  deck was equally as crowded, and equally as much confusion reigned there. He,
                  however, walked aft to the taff'rail, so as to be as far out of the way as
                  possible, and gazed with curiosity up the busy scene, wondering if it were
                  possible that things could ever be arranged and put in order, and then thinking of
                  his mother, and wondering if she then were thinking of him, and wishing that he
                  possessed only for an hour the magic carpet of Arabian story that carried its
                  fortunate possessor whither-soever he wished the instant the wish was formed—that
                  he might again see her before he sailed.</p>
               <p>Soon after the captain and pilot came on board together, the anchor was hove up:
                  all persons that belonged ashore were ordered to leave the vessel: the steam-tug
                  was lashed alongside, and the Seringapatam, with her decks still in a state of
                  apparently inextricable confusion—for if a ship were to remain in port a month
                  after she was ready for sea, the decks never would be otherwise—was towed out to
                  the mouth of the river.</p>
               <p>Gerald remained on deck till dark, and then sought his stateroom, for he had
                  little appetite for the first meal at sea, which was hurriedly prepared by the
                  steward for such as were desirous of partaking of it, and lying down with his
                  clothes on, in spite of the many thoughts that crowded themselves upon his mind,
                  was soon asleep.</p>
               <p>When he awoke in the morning, he knew by the rolling motion of the vessel that she
                  had passed beyond the mouth of the river, and was now fairly at sea in the
                  channel. A slight sensation of nausea at the stomach, occasioned by the
                  unaccustomed motion and the close smell of the cabin, caused him to hasten on deck
                  to breathe the fresh air.</p>
               <p>A miraculous change had taken place during the night. The dirty lumbered decks
                  were cleaned, and everything was in its place, while the decks just washed down by
                  the morning watch, were as clean as the floor of an uncarpeted drawing-room. The
                  wind was fair, and the ship was sailing fully eight miles an hour, the steam-tug
                  having cast adrift from her three or four hours before. They were rapidly passing
                  the coast, and Gerald, who soon recovered from his temporary sensation of nausea,
                  inquired of the officer of the deck what part of the coast it was they saw.</p>
               <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7199-00000093"/>
               <p>"The North Foreland," replied the mate. "That town you see there a little ahead,
                  to leeward, is Ramsgate."</p>
               <p>"When shall we reach the South Foreland?" inquired Gerald.</p>
               <p>"In the course of a couple of hours, if this breeze holds, as it seems likely to
                  do," returned the mate, "we shall be off Dover. That point there looming up ahead
                  is the South Foreland."</p>
               <p>Gerald looked towards the point of land indicated by the mate with great interest.
                  With the coast from Dover to Herrington he was well acquainted the, latter town
                  being but a few miles distant from the former, and he resolved not to retire from
                  deck until Herrington was passed. He mentioned to the mate that his boyhood had
                  been spent in Herrington, and begged him to tell him when they approached it.</p>
               <p>"I will have you called when we reach Dover," said the mate; "meanwhile as the
                  bell is ringing for breakfast, you had better go down to the cabin. You will have
                  plenty of time to get your breakfast."</p>
               <p>Gerald, who had eaten nothing the evening before and whose appetite had returned
                  while breathing the sea air, thought this very good advice, and descended into the
                  cabin to take his first meal on board the Indiaman.</p>
               <p>There was a poor account of passengers at the table although he had observed on
                  the previous evening that all the state rooms were occupied; but many were already
                  sea sick, and others fatigued with their exertions the day before, had not felt
                  inclined to get up to breakfast.</p>
               <p>In half an hour Gerald was again on deck.</p>
               <p>"We are passing the South Foreland now," said the mate, as he stepped upon the
                  poop deck. "That's Dover you see there on the starboard bow. Take the spyglass and
                  you will be able to see the Castle quite plainly; in another hour or less we shall
                  be abreast of it."</p>
               <p>In the course of that period the town of Dover was passed, and Gerald watched with
                  breathless interest the line of coast, every inch of which he knew from that town
                  to Herrington—the church of which—that church which the reader will recollect had
                  once been <emph>whitewashed</emph> by order of the Board of Admiralty—he could
                  already discover, perched high, seemingly, upon the very verge of the cliff. Soon
                  the vessel was abreast of the church, and then the town of Herrington, and the
                  parsonage house of the good old vicar, situated near the church, were distinctly
                  visible.</p>
               <p>He could even see the people walking on the cliffs, and he pleased his fancy by
                  imagining that one figure, walking on the cliff near the church, was Mr. pearce,
                  who he knew was fond of strolling in that spot and watching the vessels passing
                  beneath. He recollected every thing that had befallen him in Herrington. He
                  recognized the favorite haunts where he had been wont to stroll with Alice, and he
                  fancied he could even discover among the numerous huts on the beach the famous
                  boat-house of his old friend, Jemmy Milton—and he wondered whether the quaint old
                  man was on the beach watching the indiaman as she sailed swiftly by.</p>
               <p>But the wind began to freshen and the motion of the vessel to grow more violent,
                  and Gerald, used though he had been to sail out in Jemmy's fishing boat, began to
                  feel a strange sensation in his stomach, and shortly became so sick that he was
                  glad to retire to his state-room.</p>
               <p>The breeze remained favorable for several days, and the Seringapatam made a rapid
                  passage down channel and through the Bay of Biscay, where stormy weather and
                  adverse winds detained her for a week; but the weather again clearing up and the
                  wind veering round to the Northward, the ship again made rapid headway, and the
                  latitude of the North East Trades was reached in a wonderfully short time after
                  leaving port.</p>
               <p>Gerald had quite recovered from his sea sickness before the vessel was well clear
                  of the channel, but the Trade winds were reached before the majority of the
                  passengers showed themselves<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7199-00000094"/> selves
                  upon deck; but after this period every body seemed happy; the regrets at leaving
                  home were forgotten, and the future beamed cheerfully before them.</p>
               <p>The passengers on board the Seringapatnam being in no way connected with my story,
                  I shall pass them over very cursorily. They comprised the customary class of
                  passengers to be found on board an outward bound Indiaman. There were two young
                  ladies, East Indians by birth, being the daughters of a resident Judge, who had
                  been at school at Brighton, and now, under the charge of a governess, were
                  returning to India to their parents; there was an elderly young lady, going to
                  India, it was said, to visit her brother, who held an appointment in the Company's
                  service; perhaps this was true, but the first mate, who was a bit of a wag,
                  informed Gerald that he thought it was not altogether sisterly affection that had
                  prompted her to undertake the voyage. He believed that she was going out in the
                  hope of catching a husband, in the shape of some jaundiced, liver-diseased
                  official of the Company, whose yellow gold would compensate for his
                  yellow-skin—the elderly young lady having reached some years before, the age when
                  ladies are laid on the shelf and labelled "unmarriageable" in England. The mate
                  furthermore said he had never made a voyage that one or two ladies of her class
                  had not gone out as passengers, and what is more the chances were more than even
                  that they succeeded in bringing down their game. There was a bilious looking major
                  returning from a three years' furlough, and two young cadets from the Cadet's
                  College at Croydon, who, fresh colored and full of life, spirit and hope, were
                  going out to India to become in time as yellow and bilious as the major. There was
                  a chaplain and his wife going to join the garrison at Cawnpore, and a young doctor
                  going to Calcutta to take the post of assistant surgeon in the garrison of Fort
                  William; these, with Gerald, comprised the list of passengers on board the
                  Seringapatam.</p>
               <p>Nothing worth recording happened on the passage—the vessel met with the usual
                  share of fair and foul weather; fell with a gale off the Cape of Good Hope; went
                  into Table Bay to replenish her supply of water and to obtain fresh provisions,
                  and in seventy-six days after passing the Land's End entered the mouth of the
                  Hooghly River, and came to an anchor at Diamond Harbor the same day. Thence the
                  passengers took passage in a steamer for the city of Calcutta, the ship being of
                  too heavy a draught of water to pass over the william's and Mary flats, further up
                  the river.</p>
               <p>Gerald and the other passengers who had not been in India before admired the
                  novelty of the scenery as they sailed past it; sometimes seeming, in the tortuous
                  windings, to be enclosed on a lake, encompassed on all sides by a tangled forest
                  of impenetrable jungle, and then, suddenly emerging by an outlet only visible when
                  they were close to it, the scene would open upon a native Hindoo village, with its
                  grotesque temples dedicated to the worship of Vishnoo or Bramah, each surrounded
                  by a railed enclosure in which grazed perfectly at his ease provided for for life
                  and honored as a god, the sacred bull. At night the steamer came to an anchor, and
                  then when all else was still might be heard the shrill bark of the jackal, or the
                  hideous shriek of the hyena, roaming the jungle for their prey, and the sharp cry
                  of the owl and night eagle engaged in the same predatory occupation. By the noon
                  the next day the far famed Garden Reach, where are situated the "bungalos," or
                  villas of the wealthy merchants and high officials of the government, with their
                  sloping lawns richly ornamented with tropical shrubbery and brilliant flowers,
                  reaching to the water's edge, was in sight, with the Botanical Garden on the other
                  hand—and in another hour the steamer was at anchor near Chand-paul Ghaut and the
                  City of Palaces, the proud, queen city of British India lay open to the curious
                  and admiring gaze of the strangers from a far distant shore.</p>
               <p>The passengers were soon landed in one of the numerous <foreign>dingie
                     wallahs</foreign>, or small canoes manned by Lascars, who ply for fares with
                  unceasing pertinacity, and who manage their fragile<pb n="188-189"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000095"/> barks with admirable dexterity, and Gerald seeing
                  all the other passengers leaving, asked the captain's advice as to how he should
                  act.</p>
               <p>"Have you no letters of introduction?" asked the captain in a tone of
                  surprise.</p>
               <p>"No," answered Gerald.</p>
               <p>"That's bad—very foolish indeed; you can't go to an hotel. Nobody does here who
                  has any regard for his own position. If it were known that you did so, you would
                  injure your prospects immediately. However, since it is so, you can't do better
                  than accompany me to my consignee's house. I'll vouch for you, and you'll get a
                  bed for the night, and for a week if you like; but you'll want a servant."</p>
               <p>"A servant!" said Gerald, somewhat alarmed at the thought of the expense such an
                  appendage would entail.</p>
               <p>"Of course," said the captain, "Every one must have his body servant here."</p>
               <p>"How much will it cost?" said Gerald.</p>
               <p>"Oh, a mere trifle, half a rupee a day will hire a first class one, and the
                  beggars find themselves."</p>
               <p>"Oh!" exclaimed Gerald, considerably relieved.</p>
               <p>"Here, Lall," said the captain, addressing a tall, handsome Hindoo who stood near
                  and whom he appeared to recognize.</p>
               <p>"You want Sahib, eh?"</p>
               <p>"Achah Sahib," (yes master) replied the Hindoo, whose forehead was ornamented with
                  a red and white streak to mark his caste.</p>
               <p>"Then here's a Sahib wants to hire you," continued the captain, "How much wages
                  you ask, eh?"</p>
               <p>"Me first rate fellow; hab plenty, too much
                  <foreign>chit,</foreign>"(recommendations)replied the man.</p>
               <p>"Confound your <foreign>chits,</foreign> and as to your being a good fellow, I
                  suppose you're about on a par with the rest. However," turning to Gerald, "I know
                  the fellow, so you had best engage him. How much do you ask a month?" again
                  addressing the man.</p>
               <p>Twenty-five rupees, my price," said the Hindoo.</p>
               <p>Twenty-five d——s," exclaimed the captain. "This Sahib'll give you twelve rupees a
                  month; now say if you're willing to hire, if not be off with you."</p>
               <p>"Me take," said the Hindoo, submissively, and forthwith he was installed in
                  Gerald's service, while he should remain in Calcutta.</p>
               <p>"Now the dingie wallah's alongside, lets go ashore," said the captain. "By the
                  way, you'd better take half a dozen changes of clothing with you. You'll need 'em,
                  unless you mean to come on board again early in the morning."</p>
               <p>Gerald contented himself with three shirts and the like number of pairs of white
                  trousers, and putting them into his carpet bag, stepped into his boat, and was
                  soon landed on the esplanade just at the time the equipages of the merchants,
                  officers of government, and wealthy natives were arriving filled with occupants
                  about to take their customary evening promenade. The young man thought as he gazed
                  at the handsome vehicles and the gaily attired occupants, that he had never
                  witnessed so magnificent a sight, the varied dresses of the Parsee, Hindoo,
                  Musselman, and Armenian merchants, adding a never ceasing variety to the brilliant
                  scene; but he had little time to admire the ever changing diorama; the captain was
                  in a hurry to reach the residence of his consignee, and they walked rapidly along
                  the Cheringhee Road until they came to a spacious house, which the captain
                  informed Gerald was the residence of Mr. Thompson, the merchant to whom the
                  greater portion of his cargo was consigned.</p>
               <p>Gerald was astonished at the size of the house, and the troops of servants clad in
                  white dresses, who received the captain and himself as they had been persons of
                  the highest dignity, and through the rank formed by the bowing groups, they passed
                  to the apartment in which they were received by the merchant, to whom the captain
                  introduced his young companion.</p>
               <p>The young man was kindly received and the circumstance<pb n="190-191"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000096"/> of his visit having been explained, he was
                  hospitably pressed to make his home at Mr. Thompson's house, as long as it was
                  convenient to him, and in the course of the evening. Gerald having partially
                  explained to the merchant the nature of the merchandise entrusted to his care, the
                  latter gave him the names of two or three native merchants, who would be most
                  likely to do business with him. "But," he said, "I am very sorry that I cannot
                  afford you much encouragement, young gentleman. I really can't understand what
                  possesses the people at home. Our markets are overstocked with goods of every
                  description already. Indeed they have been so for the last three months, ever
                  since the first returns from England after the news had reached there of the
                  reaction that has taken place in business. However, if your merchandise is first
                  class as they say here, A No. 1, you may perhaps get a fair price."</p>
               <p>Gerald was greatly disappointed with this intelligence; but having resolved to do
                  his best for his employers, and thinking it the wisest plan to lose no time, lest,
                  as ships were almost daily arriving, matters might become still more unfavorable,
                  he hired a palankeen next morning, and guided by his Hindoo servant, proceeded to
                  the residence of M. De Sylva, a native Portuguese merchant who, he had been
                  informed was one of the most substantial and trustworthy of the class of merchants
                  with whom it would be necessary for him to deal.</p>
               <p>Mr. De Sylva resided on the confines of the native town, but half an hour's brisk
                  ride in the palankeen borne by two stout coolies carried him to the merchant's
                  residence.</p>
               <p>It was situated near the bazaar, and the locality presented much the appearance
                  that Chatham street, New York, or Monmouth street, London, would present, were
                  these choice Hebrew localities transplanted to a tropical clime, and invested with
                  the peculiarities incidental to an oriental city. Merchandise of every conceivable
                  description was openly exposed for sale, and the passers by were urged and
                  persuaded to purchase with a degree of pertinacity unknown even in the localities
                  alluded to.</p>
               <p>One of the largest of these shops was occupied by Mr. De Sylva. The merchant was
                  at home, and Gerald having introduced himself, told the nature of his business,
                  and furthermore, informed the merchant that he had been recommended to apply to
                  him by Mr. Thompson. Mr. De Sylva was all anxiety to see the goods, and urgent in
                  his protestations that he would pay a higher price and deal more honestly by the
                  seller than any of his fellow-merchants. He was a small man nearly as darkly
                  complexioned as a Hindoo, but possessing regular European features, and an almost
                  effeminate expression of countenance; yet those who regarded him attentively,
                  might readily perceive the cunning of the paltry peddler in the sharp yet cautious
                  expression of his eye. He spoke English fluently.</p>
               <p>"When shall you have your merchandise ready?" he asked of Gerald.</p>
               <p>"In the course of a day or two," the young man replied. "The captain says he shall
                  commence discharging as soon as the ship is towed up to the city. That will be
                  to-morrow, and next day I hope to have my goods landed, and after they have passed
                  the Custom House, I presume there will be no further difficulty."</p>
               <p>"None at all, sir," said Mr. De Sylva. "Have you a copy of the invoice, that I may
                  look it over?"</p>
               <p>"I have but the original copy," said Gerald, "and that, it will be necessary for
                  me to show at the Custom House; but I will make another copy this evening, and
                  bring it you to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"Do so," said the merchant. "I am sorry you have it not with you to-day, in order
                  that I might lose no time in ascertaining in what manner I may best dispose of the
                  goods. In case I should not be able to purchase the whole, I might show the
                  invoice to my fellow-merchants, and what does not suit me may suit them."</p>
               <p>"I am greatly obliged to you," said Gerald.</p>
               <p>"By-the-bye, shall you stop on board the Indiaman asked Mr. De Sylva.</p>
               <pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7199-00000097"/>
               <p>"No," replied Gerald. "For the present, Mr. Thompson has kindly offered me a home
                  at his house; but I cannot long trespass upon his hospitality."</p>
               <p>"Why not come and stay with me?" said Mr. De Sylva. "I have a large house and half
                  a dozen rooms at your service, and my servants are your own. As we are about to do
                  business together it is but fair that you should take up your abode at my house.
                  It is the custom of the country," he smilingly added after a pause.</p>
               <p>Gerald thought it would be more desirable were he to accept the invitation so
                  freely given. He naturally felt that he was intruding upon Mr. Thompson, and as it
                  was the custom of the country for those with whom one was doing business to play
                  the part of a host, he readily consented to Mr. De Sylva's proposal.</p>
               <p>In the course of the day, notwithstanding the consignee pressed him to remain
                  assuring him that he was not inconveniencing himself nor his family in the
                  slightest degree, Gerald removed his few effects to the house of the Portuguese
                  merchant, and took up his abode there, and in the cool of the evening, Mr. De
                  Sylva offered to take him out his buggy to ride on the esplanade</p>
               <p>"You have no private venture of your own besides the merchandise entrusted to your
                  care?" said the merchant, interrogatively, in the course of the drive.</p>
               <p>"Not exactly," replied the young man; "at least nothing of consequence. I have a
                  case of dried bullock's tongues, some three hundred or so, that's all."</p>
               <p>This case of tongues had been purchased at a bargain by Mr. Hoffmann, two days
                  prior to the sailing of the Seringapatam, and had been presented by him to Gerald
                  for his own private benefit, Mr. Hoffmann telling him that as they would probably
                  be considered a rare delicacy in Calcutta, he ought to get at least half a guinea
                  apiece for them.</p>
               <p>"Bullock's tongues!" exclaimed Mr. De Sylva. "If it was not your own special
                  venture, I could put you in a way to make more of them than you can do by selling
                  them."</p>
               <p>"In what manner?" asked Gerald. "If I can in any way benefit my employers, I will
                  not allow my own interests to stand in the way of doing so."</p>
               <p>"By giving them away, or, at any rate, by so disposing of a portion of them. They
                  will be considered a great delicacy here, and a little well considered liberality
                  opens men's hearts. I should advise you to make a present of a few to each of the
                  merchants whom I will point out to you, and whom I consider likely to deal with
                  you, for you know that I, although a merchant, am likewise a commission agent for
                  others, and it is only by the exercise of the latter profession that I can hope to
                  dispose of all your merchandise for you, thought I will take a large portion, it
                  is likely, upon my own account."</p>
               <p>"I shall be happy to place the entire stock at your service, Mr. De Sylva," said
                  Gerald, "reserving only half a dozen which I intend to give to Mr. Thompson, and
                  another half dozen that I shall present to the captain of the Seringapatam."</p>
               <p>"A hundred or so will be sufficient." said the merchant, "and the remainder, after
                  we have both served our turn, as I trust we shall do, I will gladly purchase from
                  you at a fair market price."</p>
               <p>Gerald readily consented to this arrangement, and the buggy was drawing up at Mr.
                  De Sylva's residence; he and Mr. De Sylva alighted and entered the dwelling.</p>
               <p>Dinner was ready, and the Portuguese merchant played the host to admiration. His
                  hospitality appeared to be unbounded and Gerald congratulated himself on having
                  fallen in with so honest and gentlemanly a man.</p>
               <p>After dinner Mr. De Sylva observed that they might as well, to prevent mistakes,
                  ratify the verbal agreement that had passed between them, and Gerald consenting,
                  and agreement was drawn out and mutually signed, to the effect that Gerald Dalton,
                  agent for Mr. Hoffmann and others, did appoint Carlos<pb n="194-195"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000098"/> Sylva, merchant of Calcutta, sole agent for the
                  sale of the merchandise belonging to the aforesaid Hoffmann and others, now on
                  board the Seringapatam East Indiaman from London, and lying at anchor in the port
                  of Calcutta. And this matter settled, the gentlemen lighted their cigars and
                  adjourned to the verandah, to smoke and chat and enjoy the cool air of the
                  evening.</p>
               <p>In a day or two the goods in charge of Gerald were landed, and taken to the Custom
                  House, whither he himself also proceeded to hasten them through the necessary
                  forms to be observed before the heterogeneous merchandise composing the venture,
                  from the sale of which such extraordinary profit was anticipated, was free to
                  enter the Calcutta market.</p>
               <p>Gerald was somewhat annoyed at the mysterious nods and smiles that passed between
                  the Hindoo clerks, and at the seemingly facetious remarks that they made,
                  occasioning an interchange of knowing glances; but as he could not understand the
                  language in which these remarks were uttered, he remained in ignorance of the
                  cause of this singular facetiousness on their part.</p>
               <p>However, they were accommodating enough to pass the goods without giving any
                  unnecessary trouble, and glad to have got through this difficulty, Gerald lost no
                  time in hiring a bullock cart to convey his treasures to Mr. De Sylva's bazaar, as
                  he had been directed; hiring at the same time a palankeen and bearers in which he
                  accompanied the cart to the bazaar.</p>
               <p>He found Mr. De Sylva anxiously looking out for him, and by the merchant's
                  direction the goods were unloaded from the cart, and placed in the store.</p>
               <p>"Now, my good friend," said the merchant, "suppose we take some slight
                  refreshment; the day is very sultry, and you must be fatigued. Brandy pawnee lao,"
                  (bring brandy and water)he added, speaking to a servant.</p>
               <p>"I thank you," said Gerald, "but I am afraid to drink spirits so early in the
                  day."</p>
               <p>"A glass of claret then? Bring claret, too."</p>
               <p>"I have no objection to that," said Gerald, "for I feel the heat excessive and am
                  very thirsty."</p>
               <p>The merchant helped himself to brandy and water, and the young man to claret; and
                  having rested himself, Gerald expressed a desire to proceed at once to
                  business.</p>
               <p>"I have brought you a copy of my invoice," he said. "Yesterday I gave you some
                  idea of the merchandise I have under my charge; perhaps you will look over the
                  invoice and consider what can be done meanwhile I will see the goods unpacked,"
                  and leaving the merchant sitting in the verandah of his house, Gerald went into
                  the store to superintend the opening of the cases.</p>
               <p>He returned in a short time and inquired of the merchant whether he would like to
                  go with him and examine the goods.</p>
               <p>Mr. De Sylva assented, and they went back to the store together.</p>
               <p>"Rather a curious assortment of goods you have, Mr. Dalton," said the merchant,
                  looking alternately at the invoice he held in his hand and at the cases before
                  him, and occasionally lifting out and examining a portion of their contents.</p>
               <p>"Saleable, I hope?" said Gerald, interrogatively.</p>
               <p>"I hope so. We will do the best we can with them; but, my dear sir, they are
                  invoiced at a very high figure. Eye snuff! what sort of snuff is that?" he said
                  inquiringly.</p>
               <p>"That's really more than I can tell you till the cases are opened," said Gerald,
                  "although now I think of it, I believe I have a sample package in my trunk. I
                  know, however, that it has long had an immense sale in England."</p>
               <p>"Hem!" muttered the merchant, running over the contents of the invoice—"Parmesan
                  cheese—very good; I have no doubt that will do. Pickles," shaking his head. "A
                  mistake, sir; English pickles have a slow sale here. We have so many varieties of
                  our own; besides the market is overstocked. What's this—oh! curtain chintz; that
                  may do. Calicoes.</p>
               <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7199-00000099"/>
               <p>spades, rakes, hatchets—ah! I perceive, in these crates, eh? Well, very good,
                  they'll find a ready sale in the Native Bazaar. Crockery—hem! What's this?
                  Two—two—"</p>
               <p>"Two cremona violins," explained Gerald, looking over the merchant's shoulder at
                  the invoice.</p>
               <p>"Hem! and ban—ah! banjos. What are they?"</p>
               <p>"Some kind of musical instrument. A new invention I think."</p>
               <p>"Ha! one harpsichord; one spinnett—"</p>
               <p>"You know what they are?" said Gerald.</p>
               <p>"Not exactly," returned the merchant. "A new kind of instrument?"</p>
               <p>"By no means," replied the young man, "old enough in all conscience; but the
                  gentleman who sent them thought they might sell to advantage in India."</p>
               <p>"Bottle corks, labelled; Turkish cimeters; engravings; copper plates; one suit of
                  ancient armor complete, except the visor!" continued the merchant. "Why, my good
                  sir, this last assortment is a singular one indeed. I am afraid it will not be a
                  very profitable speculation to the owner."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to hear that," said Gerald, "for he is a good friend of mine. I should
                  regret that he should be a loser by my coming to India. How do you intend to
                  dispose of them? What do you propose to purchase yourself?" he continued after a
                  pause, observing that Mr. De Sylva remained silent.</p>
               <p>"I would take the hardware and cutlery," said the merchant; "but there is too much
                  of the latter for my purposes. I should advise you to permit me to dispose of the
                  whole lot of goods by auction, and I will buy in what I want; but you have
                  invoiced them far too high, indeed. To sell them, any of them indeed, at anything
                  like the prices in the invoice, you would have to store them for months, paying
                  high storage the meanwhile; though it <emph>may</emph> go at auction, it can
                  scarcely be sold in any other way."</p>
               <p>"I will think about it," said Gerald in a tone of disappointment ment. "I have to
                  go on board the Seringapatnam this afternoon, and on my way I will call on Mr.
                  Thompson and ask his advice. Meanwhile I will call on Mr. Thompson and ask his
                  advice. Meanwhile I will leave you to examine the goods more closely after they
                  are unpacked," and wishing the merchant good day, and promising to return in the
                  evening, he ordered his servant to call the bearers, who had lain themselves down
                  on the matting in the outer office to sleep—coolie fashion. He then got into the
                  palankeen and requested his servant to direct the bearers to stop at Mr.
                  Thompson's house in the Cheringhee Road.</p>
               <p>Arrived there, he requested to see the consignee, and on being introduced to him,
                  related the adventures of the morning, expressing his disappointment at the
                  appearance of things, and concluded by asking his advice how to act.</p>
               <p>"Have you the invoice with you?" asked the merchant.</p>
               <p>"It is here," said the young man, drawing the original invoice from his
                  pocket.</p>
               <p>The merchant took it, and glancing over the contents said:—</p>
               <p>"I must observe, young gentleman, that the parties who selected these goods could
                  have had little knowledge of the description of goods most suitable for this
                  country; and it is no fault of yours, but the prices at which the articles are
                  invoiced are positively outrageous. I should advise you to do as Mr. De Sylva
                  proposes, and let the goods be sold by auction as soon as possible.'</p>
               <p>"By auction!" exclaimed Gerald, catching his breath as his high flown
                  anticipations of obtaining a liberal per centage for his own share vanished. "I
                  shall obtain but a very low price for the goods at auction?"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you will do better than by selling them in any other way," replied the
                  merchant. "We dispose of immense quantities of goods in that manner here, and
                  sometimes obtain very good prices. I have sold entire cargoes by auction."</p>
               <p>"Is Mr. De Sylva a good man to trust the sale to?" inquired<pb n="198-199"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000100"/> quired the young man, his opinion of the Portuguese
                  merchant having undergone considerable modification, on account of his manner that
                  morning.</p>
               <p>"Quite as good a man as you can find among his class," replied Mr. Thompson.
                  "These Portuguese merchants are a sorry set; but they are necessary. In your case
                  you have no alternative but to trust to him. You must look sharp after him; but he
                  has a better reputation than most of his class."</p>
               <p>"Suppose I leave the goods in store for future sale?" said Gerald.</p>
               <p>"They would in that case probably remain there until they had to be sold by
                  auction to pay for the storage," replied the merchant. "If you take my advice, you
                  will dispose of them as soon as possible; you may not do so very badly after
                  all."</p>
               <p>Gerald thanked the merchant for the information he had given him, and descending
                  to the street, entered the palankeen and went on board the vessel, where a portion
                  of his luggage still remained.</p>
               <p>Descending to the cabin, he entered his state-room and unlocking his writing-desk,
                  took out the letter of instructions Mr. Hoffmann had placed in his hands the day
                  the vessel sailed from London, and read it carefully.</p>
               <p>In it he was instructed to <emph>sell at all hazards;</emph> to get as high prices
                  as possible, but to sell; and if he thought it advisable, provided he could obtain
                  the assistance of some competent person to direct him in the choice of goods, he
                  was left at liberty to invest the returns from the "venture" in the purchase of
                  such articles as would command a sale in England.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Sell</emph> at all hazards!" he muttered. "As they say in New York, 'I
                  guess I'm sold.' Well, I suppose I had better follow Mr. Thompson's advice. What
                  on earth induced them to send out such a pack of rubbish? It would serve them
                  right if I were to turn the tables upon <emph>them.</emph> I've a good mind to
                  invest the proceeds in maize or some such stuff, or to send home a cargo of
                  monkeys. However, it's no use grieving over a bad job. I'll go back to De Sylva,
                  and tell him to dispose of them to the best advantage he can, and trust to
                  chance."</p>
               <p>Having thus made up his mind, he went on shore, and returning to the residence of
                  the Portuguese merchant, told him that he should leave everything in his
                  hands.</p>
               <p>"There will be a great auction sale in the native bazaar tomorrow," said the
                  merchant. "If you are agreeable, I will send the goods there, and we'll have them
                  put up at once, the first thing as soon as the auction commences."</p>
               <p>"As you think best," replied the young man, carelessly.</p>
               <p>At an early hour on the following morning, Gerald went to the bazaar. His
                  merchandise was already there, and as his only desire now was to get rid of it as
                  quickly as possible, he was glad to learn from Mr. De Sylva, who handed him a list
                  filled with hieroglyphics that he could make neither head not tail of, that the
                  sale of his goods would commence the auction.</p>
               <p>He looked cursorily around at the throng of persons assembled; it was a motley
                  crew, comprising Mussulmen, Hindoos of every caste Parsees, Jews, Armenians,
                  Chinese, and, as he thought, representatives of every Oriental nation or tribe;
                  but not a single European was present. The confusion of tongues could not have
                  been greater at the Towel of Babel. Every body was vociferating loudly, either in
                  their own peculiar language, or in the native Bengalee common to them all; but of
                  course not a word was intelligible to the young man.</p>
               <p>"They are going to begin. How would you like the goods put up?" said Mr. De
                  Sylva.</p>
               <p>"Just as you please," replied Gerald.</p>
               <p>"You have no choice? There is nothing you would wish to dispose of in preference
                  to the rest of the goods?"</p>
               <p>"No," was the reply, "I can't understand a word that's said; and I don't
                  understand your system of selling. So, go ahead, and do the best you can."</p>
               <p>The goods were brought forward and put up promiscuously<pb n="200-201"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000101"/> ly, and to Gerald's great delight, they appeared to
                  go off tolerably well. At all events they were sold with great rapidity. There was
                  much merriment, in which the young man could not help joining, although he could
                  not understand the jokes that passed, when the elegant and well selected
                  assortment of Mr. Hoffman was exhibited. The bottle-corks were cast aside with
                  contempt; but a chinese bid readily for the banjos, and also bought the eye snuff,
                  and an old Bramin bought both the violins; the harpsichord was sold to an
                  Armenian, and the Spinette to a Jew, who also purchased the engravings and
                  copperplates. The suit of armor stuck for a long time, and when the bids did
                  commence, they appeared to be very slow; but at length this also was knocked down
                  to the Chinese, and M. de Sylva then descended from his rostrum, and with a smile
                  informed the young man that the sale of his goods was concluded.</p>
               <p>"How much has the entire lot brought?" he inquired.</p>
               <p>"That I cannot tell you just now, the sale has been so mixed up. I have bought in
                  a good many things myself. We will arrange all that hereafter. Shall we retire or
                  would you like to stay and watch the proceedings?"</p>
               <p>"I have seen enough," said Gerald.</p>
               <p>"Then we will leave," and the portuguese, and the young men retired together from
                  the bazaar.</p>
               <p>"By the by," observed Gerald, "the tongues—I did not notice that you put up the
                  tongues."</p>
               <p>"I have reserved them for myself," said the merchant. "I shall offer you six
                  rupees apiece for the hundred that remain."</p>
               <p>"How much is that equivalent to?"</p>
               <p>"To twelve shillings of English money,"</p>
               <p>"Why that is more than they are invoiced at," said Gerald, in a tone of
                  surprise.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I wish you had more of them. I would give you the same price for them."</p>
               <p>"And only one hundred was left out of the three hundred contained in the
                  package?"</p>
               <p>"Only one hundred. You know you consented to my giving away a quantity of them. I
                  distributed them among the merchants you saw at the Bazaar. It was a famous
                  thought and went a great way towards putting them in good humor. You saw how
                  readily they bid for your merchandise. Then there were six that you wished to be
                  reserved for your friend the consignee, and six for the captain of the
                  Seringapatam."</p>
               <p>"Well, it can't be helped," said the young man, but he thought to himself, "it
                  seems that the very articles that I could have sold to advantage, I have foolishly
                  disposed of in another way. A pretty kettle of fish I've made of it, any way."</p>
               <p>"It will take me some time to arrange the particulars of the sale," said the
                  merchant when they had reached his residence.</p>
               <p>"You were saying that you wished to establish an agency for the sale of eye snuff
                  in the city. I saw Whampooa, the Chinese merchant leave the Bazaar. He bought most
                  of the snuff—suppose you see him. He speaks English. I don't think you will do any
                  thing that way; but he may be willing to make some arrangement. I will give you
                  his directions. He lives in the Dobie Tollah. Your servant will know the place,
                  and when you return in the evening, we will settle up matters in regard to the
                  sale."</p>
               <p>Gerald consented to this arrangement, and desiring his servant to hire a
                  palankeen, he took with him the presents he had reserved for the consignee and the
                  captain, intending to deliver them after he had called upon the Chinese merchant,
                  and set out for Whampooa's residence.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Which tells of the result of the auction sale, and what happened afterwards,
                     and also shows that justice is awake to her interests in India as well as in
                     Europe and America.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>GERALD found Whampooa, the Chinese merchant, busily engaged in examining his new
                  purchases, which he had already removed from the Bazaar to his store.</p>
               <p>He was taking the suit of armor to pieces, several of his Chinese friends watching
                  the operation with looks of unequivocal astonishment. They looked at the young man
                  with an expression of mingled wonder and dismay, and he was soon satisfied from
                  their questions that they believed the armor to be the image of one of the
                  Englishmen's gods, and they expressed a sort of superstitious horror at the idea
                  of his having sold it and afterwards come to witness its desecration by the hands
                  of strangers. What the Chinese were going to do with it Gerald could not
                  conceive.</p>
               <p>The whole party was indulging freely in the eye snuff, its pungency causing the
                  tears to run down their cheeks as they incessantly snuffed large pinches of the
                  fragrant mixture; but when the young man explained his errand to the merchant, and
                  he in turn explained it to his friends, the whole group burst into uncontrollable
                  laughter, and the snuff getting into their eyes and down their throats, a
                  ludicrous scene of coughing, spitting and swearing heartily, in approved Chinese,
                  ensued, which looked so irresistibly comical that Gerald could not longer maintain
                  his gravity, and greatly to the indignation of the party, he in his turn laughed
                  louder than the rest.</p>
               <p>Quiet being at Length restored, Whampooa explained to him that his friends were
                  amused at the idea of establishing an agency for the sale of eye snuff in
                  Calcutta, when he had purchased enough of the mixture to last for a life time.
                  Gerald had already spoken to the consignee on the subject, and he had given him no
                  encouragement, so, after hearing what the Chinese merchant had to say, he arrived
                  at the conclusion that this scheme was also a failure, and he resolved to trouble
                  himself no more about it.</p>
               <p>He left the store, and after taking a ride through the city for an hour and
                  looking about him, he returned to the residence of the Portuguese merchant, who,
                  having made up the accounts of the sale, was ready to receive him.</p>
               <p>"I hope, Mr. Dalton, you will be satisfied," he said, when the young man entered
                  the store. "We have not quite come up to the invoice prices, but I think we have
                  done pretty well. Pray sit down and let us examine the accounts together."</p>
               <p>"How much is the sum total?" said Gerald.</p>
               <p>"Seven thousand four hundred and twenty-seven rupees, paid in cash. Deducting my
                  commission, it leaves you seven thousand two hundred and nineteen rupees."</p>
               <p>"That is in English money—!"</p>
               <p>"About seven hundred and twenty pounds!" explained the merchant.</p>
               <p>"How much?" said the young man, in a tone of such angry astonishment that the
                  merchant started in his seat.</p>
               <p>"About seven hundred and twenty pounds," he repeated.</p>
               <p>"Do you know the sum total of the invoice?" sternly demanded the young man.</p>
               <p>"Assuredly," replied Mr. De Sylva, who had recovered from his momentary alarm, and
                  looking at the invoice which was on the table before him, he read:—"Four thousand
                  seven hundred and forty one pounds."</p>
               <p>"And yet," thundered Gerald, "you have the assurance to tell me that we have done
                  pretty well. Why you have not<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7199-00000103"/> sold the
                  goods for one-sixth of the invoice prices. I have been swindled, grossly
                  swindled."</p>
               <p>"Hush, hush, young gentleman," coolly replied the merchant. "You must not use such
                  language as that. It will not do here. Did I not warn you that much of the
                  merchandise was unsaleable, and that all was badly selected."</p>
               <p>"I do not deny that," said Gerald, "but to dispose of it for such a contemptible
                  price as this; it is too bad."</p>
               <p>"Have I not your written order to dispose of your merchandise by auction, at the
                  earliest opportunity, for such prices as I could obtain?"</p>
               <p>Gerald could not deny this, so he remained silent.</p>
               <p>"If you are dissatisfied," continued the merchant, "I am quite ready to return you
                  the goods I have purchased on my own account, after deducting a fair sum for my
                  trouble."</p>
               <p>This offer Gerald felt was adding insult to injury; but he was aware that he had
                  been too precipitate, and that he could not help himself. As to taking back the
                  portion of the merchandise in the possession of the Portuguese, that he knew would
                  be folly; he had nowhere to store it; knew not how to dispose of it, and would
                  only suffer greater loss.</p>
               <p>"It's done and can't be helped," he said, "though I have a poor account to render
                  to my employers. Let me see how the goods have been disposed of, at any rate, in
                  order that I may know how to divide the miserable receipts, and apportion the
                  proper share to each."</p>
               <p>"That, I fear, will be impossible," said the merchant.</p>
               <p>"How impossible?"</p>
               <p>"Because no single article has been sold separately. Those who have purchased bid
                  for the goods in lots; for instance, here is Ram Chowdah, lot No. 4, two fiddles,
                  I box cutlery, 2 pieces of calicoes, 6 cases of eye snuff, and I case of
                  pickles—97 rupees. How can I possibly tell what was the individual amount paid for
                  any one article, or any one description of articles?"</p>
               <p>Gerald was perfectly confounded; he knew not what to do, or say—and for some
                  minutes he sat the very image of perplexity. At length rousing himself, he
                  requested Mr. De Sylva to pay him over the amount due him.</p>
               <p>"With pleasure," said the merchant; "seven thousand two hundred and nineteen
                  rupees, and six hundred rupees, being the sum I offered for the package of one
                  nineteen rupees. Here is the money; I had it counted out for you, in notes on the
                  Bank of Calcutta, before you returned. Will you please to sign this receipt?"</p>
               <p>Gerald did so, and putting the money into his pocket book, bade the merchant good
                  day; and calling his servant, procured a palankeen and desired to be taken to the
                  ghaut at which the Seringapatam lay moored, being resolved to remain no longer the
                  guest of a man who had, as he felt, so shamefully deceived him.</p>
               <p>It was late in the evening and quite dark before he arrived at the ghaut, and
                  dismissed the palankeen bearers; the clouds had been gathering overhead during his
                  journey from the Portuguese merchant's store, and there was every symptom of an
                  approaching storm.</p>
               <p>Lall, the servant, was evidently uneasy and anxious to get under shelter; but
                  Gerald, who had never yet experienced a tempest in the tropical latitudes, treated
                  the matter lightly and walked leisurely and in deep thought along the wharf to the
                  landing place where he expected to find a native passage boat in which he could
                  get on board the ship.</p>
               <p>"Hurry, Sahib, hurry; rain come." said Lall, and while he spoke, the first great,
                  warning drops began to fall. Gerald cast a glance upwards, and even his
                  inexperienced eye could discover sufficient warning of the coming storm in the
                  jetty blackness of the sky, and in the oppressive atmosphere. He quickened his
                  steps, and on reaching the landing called loudly to the <foreign>dingie
                     wallahs,</foreign> whom he could hear vociferating sharply at a short distance
                  from the ghaut where a number of dingies were lying at anchor; but he received no
                  response.</p>
               <pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7199-00000104"/>
               <p>By this time the wind had risen, and the rain began to fall rapidly; in another
                  minute it was pouring in torrents, apparently a continuous stream of water let
                  down from the sluice-gates of the heavens with a force, inconceivable to those who
                  have not witnessed such a deluge.</p>
               <p>Lall united his voice with that of his master and shouted loudly in Bengalee for
                  boat, but still there was no response to the call. The dingie wallahs, at another
                  time troublesomely pertinacious in their endeavors to procurs, had sheltered
                  themselves from the rain in the small cabins of their fragile boats, and cared not
                  to encounter the storm.</p>
               <p>"By George! this will never do; I'm as if I had been standing up to my neck in
                  water, already," said Gerald. "Lall, we must seize one of those dingies, and pull
                  on board ourselves."</p>
               <p>"How can get 'em, Sahib," said the servant, his teeth chattering with fright and
                  cold.</p>
               <p>"There is one we can spring on board of further down the ghaut," said Gerald; "the
                  stern is close in shore. I could see it quite plain through the last flash of
                  lightning."</p>
               <p>They bent their steps in the direction Gerald had pointed out, the young man
                  taking the lead himself, and the servant almost paralyzed with fright, tremblingly
                  following his master. It was only a few yards distant, yet the rain was so
                  blinding, and the night so dark—the darkness seeming to deepen after every
                  successive vivid flash of lightning, that they found great difficulty in reaching
                  the spot. However, having succeeded, Gerald sprang on board, and the Hindoo
                  followed him, falling over the stern-post of the dingie in the attempt, and
                  grazing his shins so severely that he yelled with agony. The dingie-wallahs heard
                  them, and protested wrathfully against the seizure of the boat; but Gerald did not
                  heed them, and they did not offer to come out from their shelter. Gerald, assisted
                  by the Hindoo servant, soon succeeded in weighing the light anchor, and then each
                  taking a paddle, a few strokes brought the alongside the ship, which lay at no
                  great distance from the wharf. Gerald and the servant stepped on the accommodation
                  ladder, and soon reached the deck, leaving the dingie to drift from alongside.</p>
               <p>The dingie-wallahs, however, although they had allowed the boat to be unmoored,
                  and had made no resistance when it was paddled away from the ghaut, had no idea of
                  leaving the ship without receiving the boat hire, and scarcely had Gerald and his
                  servant reached the deck before three naked, athletic fellows followed them, and
                  with loud vociferations and threatening gestures, demanded their pay.</p>
               <p>"I shan't give you a singly piece," said Gerald, when the servant had interpreted
                  the demand made upon his purse. "You refused to put me on board the ship, and you
                  may get your pay the best way you can."</p>
               <p>The head man among them approached, apparently with the intention of laying
                  violent hands upon him, which, Gerald perceiving, avoided by a dexterous movement,
                  and closing with him, hurled him over the ship's side into the water. The other,
                  seeing the fate of their leader, descended rapidly into the boat, which still lay
                  alongside, and their companion having scrambled on board, they paddled rapidly
                  towards shore, vociferating loudly and threateningly the whole distance.</p>
               <p>"They gib Sahib too much trouble to-morrow," said the servant.</p>
               <p>"Pooh!" exclaimed Gerald; "let them do what they like.</p>
               <p>"It was their duty to paddle us on board, and as they refused to do so, we were
                  justified in taking the boat."</p>
               <p>The rain was still descending in torrents, and all the crew were under shelter;
                  even the anchor watch were not to be seen.</p>
               <p>Gerald walked into the cuddy, and, after some time, succeeded in rousing the
                  steward; a light was procured, and he and the servant proceeded to change their
                  drenched clothing.</p>
               <p>When the young man took off his thin linen jacket,<pb n="208-209"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000105"/> thought for the first time of his money, and
                  putting his hand into his pocket, he drew forth his pocket-book thoroughly
                  saturated, and on opening, found all his bank notes reduced apparently to the
                  consistence of pulp. To have attempted to separate them would have been to destroy
                  them altogether, if indeed they were not already valueless. There was no help for
                  it but to lay them aside till morning, and then to endeavor to dry them in the
                  sun, and separate them, if possible.</p>
               <p>Vexed as he was, Gerald was so fatigued with the excitement, and disappointments
                  and mishaps of the day, that he flung himself on the mattress in his state-room,
                  where he soon forgot all his master, and both slept soundly till morning.</p>
               <p>Gerald's first thought, on waking in the morning, was about his money. It was a
                  melancholy sight to look at; but after an hour's exposure to the sun, the mass of
                  pulp was perfectly dry, and with the assistance of the steward, he proceeded to
                  separate it: this was a difficult, and for some time, apparently, a hopeless task;
                  but at length, with great care and patience, they succeeded in detaching the notes
                  with tolerable success, although three or four, amounting in value to nearly two
                  hundred rupees, were completely destroyed, and valueless, and a great number were
                  so disfigured that the young man though it advisable to go with them immediately
                  to the bank and get them exchanged.</p>
               <p>He was just on the point of stepping over the ship's side to go on shore, when a
                  police boat came alongside and a native officer stepped on board, accompanied by a
                  dingie wallah, who pointed out Gerald to the policeman, upon which the latter
                  handed the young man a warrant from a magistrate charging him with illegally
                  seizing a dingie, loosing it from its moorings against the wish of its owner, and
                  paddling it alongside the ship, and subsequently casting it adrift, after refusing
                  to pay the boatman; furthermore, with offering violence to the said boatmen and
                  forcibly throwing one man overboard, there by bruising and otherwise injuring him
                  severely and endangering his life.</p>
               <p>There was nothing for it but to accompany the officer to the police court, where
                  the magistrate was then sitting.</p>
               <p>"What is this charge?" said the magistrate, when the young man was brought before
                  him.</p>
               <p>The officer explained, and the dingie wallah whose arm was bandaged and who
                  pretended to be in great pain, added his complaint.</p>
               <p>"This is a very serious affair, young man," said the magistrate. "Do you wish an
                  interpreter to explain the charge made by the dingie wallah?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir," replied Gerald, "I did seize the boat and I confess to throwing the man
                  overboard, after he had assaulted me."</p>
               <p>"But you refused him payment for the use of his dingie after having taken it
                  against the will of the crew."</p>
               <p>"I did, sir, and I will explain the reason why I did so," and Gerald then told a
                  straightforward story to the magistrate, explaining the whole affair. "You had
                  some cause to feel annoyed, young man," said the magistrate when he had concluded
                  his story, "but that gave yon no right to act as you did. At that late hour of the
                  night the boatmen were not compelled by law to let their boat out for hire, and
                  your subsequent conduct on board the ship is altogether unjustifiable. The natives
                  must be protected. You will pay a fine of fifty rupees to the court, fifty rupees
                  to the man you have injured. In addition to this, the expenses of the warrant and
                  the fee to the officer who made the arrest will amount to ten rupees. You must pay
                  two hundred and ten rupees or go to jail for two months."</p>
               <p>Gerald paid the money without saying a word and left the Court. He then proceeded
                  to the bank, and after much difficulty, many objections being made, he succeeded
                  in changing the money he had left, reduced now by four hundred rupees,<pb
                     n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7199-00000106"/> two hundred having been mulcted by the
                  court, and two hundred more having been utterly destroyed by the rain.</p>
               <p>He then returned on board the ship in no very amiable frame of mind, and seating
                  himself at the table in the cabin, commenced to write to Mr. Hoffmann in relation
                  to the ill-starred "venture," as follows:—</p>

                           </opener>
                           <p>Dear Sir: I arrived safely at this port, a few days since: I left the
                              ship at Diamond Harbor, in company with captain and passengers, the
                              vessel drawing too much water to allow of her crossing the flats,
                              between that port and the city. However, she was speedily lightened of
                              a portion of her cargo, and towed up to the city on the following day.
                              I lost no time in making inquiry with respect to the best method of
                              disposing of the merchandise entrusted to my charge. The captain
                              introduced me to his consignee, and this gentleman advised me to
                              dispose of the goods to a native merchant named De Sylva. I
                              immediately sought out this person, and after having introduced myself
                              to him, and stated the nature of my business, requested to know if he
                              were willing to become a purchaser. He recommended a sale by auction—a
                              method of disposing of goods very prevalent here. Having confidence in
                              his integrity—for which too ready confidence you will doubtless blame
                              me severely—I assented to his proposals, and signed an agreement to
                              that effect. When however, he looked over the invoice and read the
                              description of the goods he pronounced the greater portion unsaleable,
                              except at a ruinous loss. Not knowing how to act, I again had recourse
                              to the consignee, Mr. Thompson, also referring him to the invoice. His
                              opinion was the same as Mr. De Sylva's. He recommended me to allow Mr.
                              De Sylva to dispose of them at the very earliest opportunity, cheering
                              me with the information that very earliest opportunity, cheering me
                              with the information that goods sold by auction sometimes brought high
                              prices. Accordingly I left the matter in De Sylva's va's hands. A
                              native auction sale was to come off the next day, and it was arranged
                              that my merchandise should be first brought to the hammer, and knocked
                              down to the highest bidder.</p>
                           <p>"It sold readily. It was <emph>knocked down</emph> with vengeance, and
                              you and I and all of us were sold with the goods.</p>
                           <p>'I am almost afraid to furnish you with the results of the sale, but
                              it is necessary that I should do so. Your goods, in toto, were
                              invoiced at ¥4741 8s., which in the currency of this country may be
                              estimated at about 47,000 rupees. The entire bill, the little venture
                              you were king enough to present me with in the bargain, was sold for
                              7819 rupees, or about ¥781—leaving a trifling balance against us of
                              ¥3,960, or thereabouts. You may thinks I am writing flippantly; but I
                              grow reckless when I think of the sacrifice, and cannot help it. The
                              worst of it is, I have been told, since the goods were sold, that
                              taking into consideration the peculiar character and the quality of
                              the assortment, they went off very favorably! The fact is that a gross
                              mistake was made in selecting the articles. Nearly all are almost
                              unmarketable here, and those which are not, the market is already
                              glutted with. The case of preserved tongues would have sold at a
                              higher rate than it was invoiced at; but I made a gross blunder in
                              giving most of the tongues away, in order, as I was led to anticipate,
                              that the other merchandise would sell more favorably. A pretty mess I
                              have made of it, as you will perceive. This, however, is now all. Out
                              of the gross proceeds there is yet ¥40 to be deducted, I having had to
                              pay—20, or 200 rupees for kicking a rascally Coolie overboard, and ¥20
                              more having been ruined in consequence of the money which was paid in
                              bills, having got wet in a rain storm, which came near drowning me,
                              and which nearly rendered the whole of the paper trash valueless. One
                              hundred rupees I shall retain for my own use. You must perceive that
                              this is necessary, for I cannot leave myself utterly penniless in a
                              strange land. The residue, amounting to ¥731, I shall transmit to
                                 London<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7199-00000107"/> by means of a
                              bill of exchange. With regard to the division of this sum, all I can
                              say is, that it must be left to your own judgment. The sale was
                              effected in must be left to your own judgment. The sale was effected
                              in such a complicated manner (and I, not knowing a word of the
                              language was unable to interfere) that it is quite out of the question
                              for me to give any idea as to the amount received for any one
                              package—fiddles any eye-spades, and calicoes, pictures and pickles,
                              hard-ward and crockery, were all jumbled articles sold for, I cannot
                              therefore say, but I believe for very little. The natives have no idea
                              of the fine arts, though the banjos appeared to tickle the fancy of
                              the Chinaman who bough them. This fellow also bough most of the
                              eye-snuff, and the suit of armor, in one lot, I was told, and De Sylva
                              says that the fellow is going to make a god—a goss, I believe they
                              call it—out of the armor. I called upon him, after the sale, in order
                              to try to establish an agency here for Mr. Grimsby, but he laughed at
                              the idea, and said there was enough snuff here now, to last for a
                              quarter of a century. So that endeavor fell through.</p>
                           <p>"Independently of the bad selection that was made, you labored under a
                              great mistake in believing that there was a great demand for goods
                              here. There is nothing of the kind. Most of the articles sent our from
                              England, can be purchased here for less than they can be bought in
                              London; and as to investing the money I have received in goods, that
                                 <emph>may</emph> find a sale in England, to tell the plain truth, I
                              am afraid if I attempt such a thing. I shall make another blunder. I
                              know that you will all be very angry, but I have done the best I
                              could, and cannot help the result.</p>
                           <p>"I shall not return home in the Seringapatam, but I have not yet
                              decided what I shall do; indeed I scarcely know what I can do. Should
                              I ever be in a position to indemnify you for the losses you have
                              sustained, you will. perhaps see me again; if not, I shall probably
                              never return to England.</p>
                           <p>"I should like you to write to me, at all events; and if you direct
                              the letter to the care of Mr. Thompson, merchant, &amp;c., Cheringhee
                              Road, wherever I may be, it will reach me, as I shall leave directions
                              with him to forward it to me.</p>

               <p>Having finished this task, Gerald applied himself to writing a letter to his
                  mother, in which he briefly informed her of the result of his adventure, and told
                  her that he had resolved to remain abroad for some time, in hopes of retrieving
                  this misfortune. He begged her not to grieve on his account, since he hoped that
                  all would be well in the end, and assuring her of his unalterable respect and
                  affection, he promised faithfully to write again, and let her know where he was,
                  and what he was doing, as soon as he himself arrived at any conclusion. In a
                  postscript, he requested her to let him know whether anything had yet been heard
                  of or from Alice—intimating further, that is such were the case, it would have
                  tendency to hasten his return.</p>
               <p>He also wrote to the vicar, giving him a brief account of his proceedings; and
                  then hastening on shore, he went to the bank, and procured a bill of exchange on
                  London, for the amount mentioned in Mr. Hoffmann's letter. After which, having
                  deposited his letters in the post-office, he strolled listlessly along the
                  streets, attended by his servant, in the direction of the esplanade, pondering as
                  he walked, upon his prospects, and endeavoring to come to some conclusion
                  regarding his future proceedings. <q>

                  <p>A very short chapter, which shows how pride sometimes overcomes right and

               </argument>
               <p>WHILE strolling along the esplanade, gazing listlessly upon the river and its
                  motley show of vessels of every description, and of every nation, from the heavy
                  English East Indiaman to the picturesque Malay prou, Gerald met, accidentally,
                  Captain King, of the Seringapatam.</p>
               <p>"Ah! Mr. Dalton," was the captain's exclamation: "glad to see you; why your
                  thoughts appear to be wool-gathering; what is it so earnestly engages your
                  attention on that particular spot on the river upon which your eyes have been
                  fixed so attentively for the last five minutes?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing, captain, nothing," replied the young man. "My thoughts, as you say, were
                  wool-gathering just then; I'm thinking what I shall do next."</p>
               <p>"How do you mean!"</p>
               <p>"I mean where will be my next destination."</p>
               <p>"Why, you will of course return to London with me on board the Seringapatam."</p>
               <p>"No," replied Gerald; "I have made up my mind not to return to England, just
                  now."</p>
               <p>"Pooh! pooh!" said the captain; "you are disheartened at the failure of the
                  'venture' you had in your charge."</p>
               <p>"You have heard then," said Gerald, "of the ridiculous sacrifice I have been
                  compelled to make?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I heard of it just now, from Mr. Thompson, but I could have told you as much
                  during the passage out. I once got sight of your invoice, and I knew as soon as I
                  read it, that your venture would prove a failure; but it's no fault of yours. It
                  serves the simpletons right who dispatched you with such a pack of rubbish."</p>
               <p>"Why did you not warn me of the result?" asked the young man.</p>
               <p>"There was no occasion to do so. It would have discouraged you, and answered no
                  purpose. 'Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof,' is a text I've often heard
                  my old mother repeat, and it's a maxim I generally allow to guide me. But it's
                  folly for you to take the matter so much to heart. You've done the best you could
                  do; it's no use sighing over what can't be helped. Cheer up, forget all about it,
                  and make your home aboard the ship, 'till we sail, and then return with me to
                  London."</p>
               <p>"No," replied Gerald, "my mind is made up on that point. I shall not go back to
                  the drudgery of the shop again, I promise you."</p>
               <p>"A wilful man must have his way," said the captain: "however, what do you intend
                  doing?"</p>
               <p>"That I don't know yet," replied Gerald. "I have been thinking of going to Ceylon.
                  I have relations there; the difficulty is to find a ship that's going to that
                  island."</p>
               <p>"Ships occasionally sail for Ceylon from here," replied the captain, "and if you
                  can wait long enough, as you have friends in Ceylon, and will not return to
                  England, I don't know that it isn't the wisest thing you can do; but you'll find
                  the passage-money come pretty high."</p>
               <p>"I know that," said Gerald; "but that doesn't trouble me much. I have very little
                  money, but I'll work my passage, some way or other; get a berth as steward, or
                  assist the cook, or anything that comes to hand."</p>
               <p>"You'll not find that very agreeable," said the captain, "particularly as you
                  haven't been used to it; but if that be your resolve, I think I can manage the
                  matter for you. The<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7199-00000109"/> Firefly is going to
                  sail in the course of next week for Borneo and the Phillipine Islands, and on her
                  return, she will sail for Trincomallee. At what part of the island do your
                  relatives reside?"</p>
               <p>"At Colombo," said Gerald.</p>
               <p>"Ah, that's on the western side. However you can easily get to Colombo from
                  Trincomallee. Would you like to go the voyage?"</p>
               <p>"I should like nothing better," responded Gerald.</p>
               <p>"Well, then, I know the owners and the captain, and if you have no objections to
                  take the berth of steward, though I warn you, you won't fancy it, I think I can
                  procure it for you."</p>
               <p>"I will accept it, gladly," responded the young man.</p>
               <p>"Go aboard the ship, then, and sleep to-night, I shall be aboard after tiffin
                  to-morrow; meanwhile I'll see the owners and the captain, and when you meet me
                  again, I'll let you know what success I have met with."</p>
               <p>Gerald thanked the captain, and the latter excusing himself, by saying that he had
                  to meet the consignee, left the young man to enjoy his walk and his ruminations
                  alone.</p>
               <p>It was not customary for any person but the mates and the crew to live on board
                  the ship, but Gerald was very glad to embrace the captain's offer. He did not
                  choose to quarter himself any longer on Mr. De Sylava, and he felt a degree of
                  repugnance to trespassing on the hospitality of the consignee, and yet his stock
                  of money was insufficient to enable him to maintain himself at even the wretched
                  apologies for hotels that were then to be found in Calcutta, kept by natives of
                  the lowest class, and frequented only by sailors out of employment. He strolled
                  about till nightfall, and then hired a boat and went on board the Seringapatam,
                  having in the first place, greatly to the regret of the native servant he had
                  engaged, paid him his wages, and discharged him.</p>
               <p>At the appointed hour the next morning, the captain came on board.</p>
               <p>"I have seen the owners of the Firefly," he said, addressing Gerald, as soon as he
                  saw him; "and the captain, too. The owners make no objection, and the captain is
                  willing to receive you as his steward. The vessel sail this day week, and you can
                  go on board and commence duty at once, if you choose. The vessel, however, returns
                  to Calcutta before sailing for Ceylon."</p>
               <p>"I don't care for that," said Gerald. "How long does the captain expect to be
                  absent on this cruise?"</p>
               <p>"Probably six, eight, or ten months. It's impossible to say, as he is going on a
                  trading voyage among the island."</p>
               <p>"That's all the better," said Gerald; "I have written letters to England, and I
                  expect answers to arrive at Calcutta in the course of eight months. I will join
                  the Firefly to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"As you please," responded the captain; "but think once again before you make the
                  engagement, whether you had better not return to England with me."</p>
               <p>"As I have told you before, my mind is made up on that point," said Gerald.</p>
               <p>The captain turned away to give some directions to the chief mate relating to the
                  ship, and Gerald descended to the cabin to pack up is clothes, and prepare for his
                  new situation.</p>
               <p>The next day he joined the brig Firefly, signed articles, and his name was duly
                  enrolled in the list of the crew, which consisted chiefly of Lascars and Malays;
                  and the week afterwards the vessel sailed for Borneo, Gerald having left
                  directions with Mr. Thompson to receive any letters that might arrive for him from
                  England, and to retain them until the return of the Firefly to Calcutta.</p>
               <p>It was not without feelings of regret, after all, that the young man passed the
                  Seringapatam, in the brig, as the latter was being towed down the river. It was
                  like placing a gulf between himself and his mother, over which it might be long
                  ere he could cross—which he might never cross again. It was separating the last
                  link which bound him to home—for England<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7199-00000110"
                  /> land was home to him, although it was not his native land. He thought, too, of
                  Alice, and what little prospect there was of his seeing her again; but his pride
                  was too great to allow of his returning home, unsuccessful; and though he knew
                  that he was acting wrong, he felt that the die was cast, and now he was a wanderer
                  indeed.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Which related to Alice Thornton, and lifts the veil, without however,
                     explaining the cause of her mysterious disappearance from Herrington.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>LEAVING Gerald to purse his wandering course, I will make a retrograde movement
                  and bring back my story to the date of Alice Thornton's disappearance from
                  Herrington.</p>
               <p>As the reader is aware, she was strolling along the pathway on the cliffs on the
                  day in question, and was just thinking of returning homewards, when she heard
                  footsteps behind her, and looking back, she saw a gentleman approaching her. She
                  stepped aside in order to give him room to pass; but he slackened his pace and
                  addressing her, asked if her name was not Alice Thornton,</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," she replied, surprised at the question being put to her by a person
                  she had never before seen, and somewhat alarmed, although the stranger's
                  appearance was gentlemanly and his manner respectful.</p>
               <p>"I thought so from your strong resemblance to your mother," continued the
                  stranger, "You don't know me? How is it possible you should, poor child?" he
                  added, "when you have never before seen me? Did you ever hear your father speak of
                  your uncle, your mother's brother? I am he."</p>
               <p>"I have not," replied Alice. "My father died when I was little more than an
                  infant, and my mother I don't recollect."</p>
               <p>"True, true," said the stranger, "but you know what was your mother's maiden
                  name?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, it was Craddock, I believe. I don't know that I<pb n="220-221"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000111"/> was ever told so, but I have a locket that belonged
                  to my mother. It is all I possess as a memento of her, and Craddock is engraved
                  upon it."</p>
               <p>"It contains two locks of hair, plaited together," said the stranger. "Will you
                  permit me to see it? Have you it with you?"</p>
               <p>Alice hesitated for some moments. She knew the stranger could employ force in that
                  lonely place, if he chose: but his manner was so respectful, his appearance so
                  engaging, that she did not fear this, and yet she hesitated to draw forth the
                  locket and show it to a total stranger.</p>
               <p>The gentleman observed this hesitation. "You think me rude. I appear so," he said,
                  "in making such a request: do as you please, I shall not urge the matter; but as I
                  have told you, I am your uncle and the brother of your deceased mother. The hair
                  in that locket consists of mine and hers."</p>
               <p>Alice drew forth the locket and unfastening the ribbon by which it was attached to
                  her neck, placed it in the stranger's hands.</p>
               <p>He took it, and touching the spring, gazed long upon the relic within: "Poor
                  Alice!" he said, with visible emotion, as, clasping the trinket again he restored
                  it to the young lady.</p>
               <p>"I have called upon the vicar of this parish, to-day," he continued, after a
                  pause. "I brought a letter to him from Mr. Ashley with whom you lived after your
                  father's death."</p>
               <p>"Have you lately come from India?" said Alice, interested in what the stranger had
                  said, and asking a question for the first time.</p>
               <p>"I have. It is just five months ago since I left Colombo, where Mr. Ashley is now
                  settled."</p>
               <p>"Was he well? and his family, were they all well?" said Alice.</p>
               <p>"All well, and very comfortably settled when I saw them, "replied the
                  stranger.</p>
               <p>They had turned off from the narrow path on the cliff and were now approaching the
                  high road to Dover.</p>
               <p>"You are fond of walking, I think," returned the gentleman. "You have yet a long
                  walk before you, to Herrington."</p>
               <p>"Only about two miles," replied Alice. "It is nothing. I am accustomed to
                  walking."</p>
               <p>"Nevertheless, a ride would not perhaps be unacceptable. I have a carriage in
                  waiting close by, which I quitted half an will return to Herrington together."</p>
               <p>Half afraid of she knew not what, and yet unwilling to refuse the invitation given
                  in so kind a manner, Alice hesitatingly allowed the stranger to assist her into
                  the carriage, which they had now reached, and which she observed was a
                  post-chaise. The gentleman followed, and the post-boy mounting his horse, they
                  started off in the direction of Herrington: but instead of turning of when they
                  reached the by-lane which led to Herrington, the post-boy continued to follow the
                  high road.</p>
               <p>Sometime elapsed before Alice discovered the mistake, as she supposed, the
                  gentleman having kept her in conversation: but at length she remarked that they
                  had passed the by-lane, and were going in the opposite direction from
                  Herrington.</p>
               <p>"I Know it, Alice," replied the gentleman. "You will allow me to call you Alice, I
                  hope, for you are my niece, and will be to me henceforward. I trust, a daughter. I
                  am going to Dover."</p>
               <p>"I Must return to Herrington," said the young lady, much alarmed. "Mrs. Dalton
                  will be expecting me, and willl be alarmed at my absence. Permit me to alight
                  here, or if you are indeed my uncle, return with me to Herrington, and call on
                  Mrs. Dalton. She will be glad to see you."</p>
               <p>"Not to-night, Alice. You must go with me to Dover. There are reasons for my
                  acting thus, which by and by will be explained to you, and which will be
                  satisfactory."</p>
               <p>"I must return to Herrington," said Alice. "It is cruel, unmannerly, ungentlemanly
                  to deceive me thus," and as she spoke has endeavored to unfasten the door of the
                  post-chaise.</p>
               <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7199-00000112"/>
               <p>"Alice," said the gentleman, arresting her hand, "are you mad? If you were to
                  spring from the carriage while it is going at the rapid pace, you would kill
                  yourself instantly. No harm is intended you will one day be grateful. You
                     cannot—<emph>must</emph> not leave the carriage or escape from me. I have
                  returned from India expressly to find you, and a fortune depends upon my
                  endeavors. I will tell you this much,—Alice, you are an heiress."</p>
               <p>The young lady looked wildly round. She saw that escape was hopeless. They might
                  ride for miles on that country road at that hour, without meeting with any one
                  able to render her assistance if she were to call for it, or if her cries could be
                  heard. She trembled with fear and agitation, alternately threatening and
                  imploring, and at length did what most young ladies in her situation would have
                  done, burst into a passion of tears.</p>
               <p>Her uncle, Mr. Craddock, for such he, in fact, was, spoke to her kindly, and tried
                  every means to console her, but in vain. Her only hope was in making her escape,
                  and throwing herself on the protection of the first person she met when the
                  carriage should stop at Dover.</p>
               <p>But the town was reached and the post chaise rattled along the streets, past the
                  hotels, and down to the piers, at which the French packet was lying. Here it
                  stopped, and the post-boy alighted and opened the door, Mr. Craddock having in the
                  meantime warned his niece that resistance would be useless.</p>
               <p>He alighted from the vehicle and held out his hand to assist the young lady in her
                  descent. She also alighted and looking around saw only the crowd of seamen and
                  laborers putting the last packages of luggage on board the packet which was just
                  about to sail. All were too busy to heed her had she called upon them to do so;
                  there was too much confusion and noise had she attempted to call, to allow of her
                  voice being heard. Mr. Craddock guarded her very closely, as he led her on board
                  the vessel; but his precaution was needless; before she reached the deck he felt
                  her weight fall heavily upon his arm—the poor girl had fainted. He appeared to
                  have anticipated this, for he remarked to the captain of the packet as he bore her
                  tenderly across the deck and into the cabin, that this was the sick lady for whom
                  he had engaged a passage to Calais, the day before, and he requested that
                  functionary to lead him to the most comfortable cabin that was disengaged.</p>
               <p>The captain and crew, waiters and servants, were all French, as were the majority
                  of the passengers, and Alice after having been carried to the cabin was attended
                  by a French stewardess, whose care, assisted by the attentions of Mr. Craddock,
                  soon restored her to consciousness. Her uncle remained with her for a couple of
                  hours, during which period the packet had put to sea. He urged her by every
                  persuasion he thought likely to console her, to calm her unavailing grief,
                  assuring her again and again, that it was for her welfare he was acting; but at
                  length, growing weary of his useless efforts, he left her in charge of the
                  stewardess and went upon deck.</p>
               <p>The woman's countenance and actions showed that she suspected something was wrong;
                  but Mr. Craddock had quieted any scruples of conscience she might have felt with
                  the present of a heavy fee; and even had she been inclined or able to serve the
                  young lady, communication was impossible, since neither she nor Alice understood a
                  word of each other's language. However, she was kind and attentive—even
                  officiously so—and Alice after weeping in silence for hours at length wept herself
                  to sleep.</p>
               <p>When she awoke in the morning the packet, which had "lain to" during a greater
                  portion of the night, in consequence of the foggy weather, was being moored
                  alongside the pier at Calais.</p>
               <p>The first act on the part of Mr. Craddock after having procured an apartment and
                  ordered breakfast to be prepared at the Hotel d' Angleterre, was to procure a
                  supply of such necessary<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7199-00000113"/> articles of
                  clothing, as Alice needed to secure her comfort during the remainder of the
                  journey that lay before her, of which Calais was only the first stage. These
                  articles were procured without regard to expense, and after breakfast Mr.
                  Craddock, who seemed anxious to exert every effort to reconcile his niece to her
                  abduction from home, proposed a walk round the town, at the same time he placed a
                  well-filled purse in her hands, telling her not to spare the money, but to
                  purchase anything that pleased her fancy, regardless of the cost. Alice refused
                  the purse but accepted the clothing, which she really needed, since, as the reader
                  is aware, she had been carried from some with no articles of attire beyond what
                  she put on for an afternoon's walk; besides, the dress she wore was not of a
                  material that corresponded with the gentlemanly habiliments of her uncle. This
                  fact at this time, probably troubled Alice very little; but doubtless it had its
                  weight with Mr. Craddock.</p>
               <p>The young lady begged for permission to write to Mrs. Dalton, and to let her know
                  the circumstances connected with her disappearance; or at least to let her know
                  that she was alive and well and that no accident had befallen her. But this
                  petition was peremptorily refused. It would serve no purpose he said. It would
                  only cause greater anxiety. By and by she should write, when they had reached
                  their journey's end, but not now.</p>
               <p>After dinner the diligence was to start for Pairs. Mr. Craddock had engaged the
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coupe</foreign> for himself and his neice, and before
                  nightfall they were several leagues on their way to the French capital. Amiens was
                  reached in time for breakfast on the porte St. Denis and the travellers were in
                  Pairs.</p>
               <p>Mr. Craddock remained at the capital several weeks, in order to afford his young
                  charge every opportunity of visiting the most attractive sights. The
                  Louvre—L'Eglise de la Madeline—Pere la Chaise—the Luxembourg—Versailles—everything
                  that was worth visiting in the city and its environs was visited, and Mr.
                  Craddock, who spoke the language perfectly, and who had once resided for some
                  months in Pairs, proved himself a valuable and interesting cicerone. His manner
                  was so uniformly kind to his niece, and his desire to please her so apparent, that
                  the young lady gradually resumed her customary, cheerfulness, and learnt to take
                  pleasure in her uncle's society, although she still continued to beseech him to
                  allow her to write to Mrs. Dalton, telling him that if she were allowed that
                  privilege, she would be quite contented to remain with him; but to all her
                  requests and remonstrances, in relation to the subject, he turned a deaf ear,
                  merely telling her that by and by he should do so, but not now—he had reasons that
                  would one day explain for his actions. Neither had he yet informed her of the
                  cause which had led him to act so mysteriously in carrying her from her home. All
                  she was told was, that she was an heiress, but that peculiar circumstances in
                  relation to the wealth that would one day be her's, required this secrecy.</p>
               <p>At length they left Paris for Orleans, at which place Mr. Craddock informed his
                  niece he intended to leave her at school for a year or two, while he went abroad
                  upon urgent business.</p>
               <p>"You know, Alice," he said, "that your education has necessarily been limited.
                  When I say this, I mean that you have not been taught those accomplishments which
                  will be essential to you in the social position in which you will be essential to
                  you in the social position in which you will hereafter be required to move. So far
                  as regards a plain, substantial, useful education, Mrs. Dalton has done has done
                  her part well. One day you shall have the pleasure of recompensing her for her
                  care and affection."</p>
               <p>Whenever any allusion was made to Mrs. Dalton, Alice was always deeply affected.
                  Her uncle told that she ought strive to conquer this feeling. Mrs. Dolton, as well
                  as Mr. Ashley, had been kind to her, said; they had been very kind, and merited
                  her warmest gratitude, but they were not any way related to her, and she must
                  strive to form new and closer attachments.</p>
               <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7199-00000114"/>
               <p>She often thought of Gerald, and wondered whether he thought so much of her, and
                  whether he lamented her mysterious disappearance. "Is he still in London," she
                  would ask herself, "or has he returned again to Herrington? Shall I
                     <emph>ever</emph> see him again?" but she had never mentioned his name to Mr.
                  Craddock.</p>
               <p>Gerald had given her a miniature of himself the day before he left Herrington for
                  London: it was a cheap thing enough, and had been taken in the United States when
                  he was about four years of age. If it had been like him then, it bore very little
                  resemblance to him as Alice had last seen him; still she cherished the trifle, and
                  always wore it in her bosom.</p>
               <p>One day, while she was still in Paris, her uncle came unexpectedly into the room
                  in which she was seated. She held the miniature in her hand, and was gazing at it
                  earnestly—so earnestly, that she was not aware of his approach until he stood
                  behind her chair. A tear had fallen from her eyelid, and partially obscured the
                  portrait. It was the first time her uncle had seen it, and after standing behind
                  the chair for a few moments, he said:—</p>
               <p>"What have you there, my love, that so interests you? whose portrait is that?"</p>
               <p>Until he spoke, Alice had been unaware of his presence. She started, blushed, and
                  replied that it was a miniature of Mrs. Dalton's son, Gerald.</p>
               <p>A frown, such as she had never before seen upon her uncle's face, corrugated his
                  brow, and he turned pale with anger. "Give it to me," he said—"I insist upon your
                  casting away such silly baubles—give it to me, instantly." Alice was frightened,
                  and starting from her chair, and confronting her uncle, she looked up in his face,
                  holding her breath, her face as pale with affright as his with passion.</p>
               <p>Perceiving her terror, and fearing he had gone too far, and had undone that which
                  he had been for weeks attempting to do—to gain her confidence and affection, he
                  said, in a milder tone:—</p>
               <p>"I am not angry, Alice; but you know, my love, that I wish you to forget these
                  people; but you can keep the bauble if you choose, only do not, for appearance
                  sake, wear it round your neck. Let me see it, if you please."</p>
               <p>Alice took the ribbon to which it is confined, from her neck, and handed him the
                  miniature.</p>
               <p>"A child, a mere child," he said, after looking at it. "I knew that Mrs. Dalton
                  had a son in London, but he is much older than this." "Yes, uncle," said Alice;
                  "he is about the same age as I am. That portrait was taken in America, when he was
                  a child."</p>
               <p>"I have never spoken to you, Alice, of Mrs. Dalton's son," said her uncle,
                  "because I thought you were almost a stranger to him, and could have no interest
                  in him; besides, I did not wish to keep alive these old recollections which your
                  present prospects call upon you to obliterate from your memory. The boy went to
                  London a long time ago, did he not?"</p>
               <p>"Only a few months since, uncle," said Alice. "He gave me this as a keepsake, when
                  he was about to leave Herrington."</p>
               <p>"And you have worn it round your neck ever since?" said Mr. Craddock, with
                  difficulty restraining his anger.</p>
               <p>"Yes, uncle."</p>
               <p>"My love, you must lay it aside; keep it if you like, but do not wear it about you
                  any longer. It is foolish and improper—quite unbecoming. He is no relative of
                  yours, and probably you will never meet him again. Should you meet, it will be in
                  a social position so entirely different to that which you held mutually when you
                  last saw each other, that intimacy would be no longer proper. Oblige me in this
                  matter, and I will replace the paltry trinket with something far more
                  valuable."</p>
               <p>Fearful of her uncle's anger, and feeling she was altogether in his power, Alice
                  consented to place the miniature in her drawer. Her uncle kissed her, and that
                  same day presented her with a miniature of a handsome boy, set in brilliants.—</p>
               <pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7199-00000115"/>
               <p>"There," he said, "I have kept my promise; wear that Some day youy may meet the
                  original."</p>
               <p>"Who is it, uncle," asked she.</p>
               <p>"Never mind now," he replied smiling. "I have much to explain to you by and by.
                  When we do come to an explanation, you shall know who that miniature
                  represents."</p>
               <p>Nothing further was said upon the subject at that time. The costly gift occupied
                  the place of Gerald's miniature round Alice's neck; but her uncle might not have
                  been so well satisfied as he appeared to be, had he been present in her little
                  bed-room when retired for the night, and seen with what affection the discarded
                  miniature was taken from its secret hiding-place, and kissed, and wept over, and
                  with what carelessness, nay, almost contempt the costly locket he had presented
                  her with was thrown off, without a look being deigned at the miniature, and yet it
                  represented a beautiful dark, complexioned, curly headed boy, much handsomer than
                  Gerald.</p>
               <p>However, while seated in the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coupe</foreign> of the
                  diligence, on their way to Orleans, Mr. Craddock carelessly renewed the
                  subject.</p>
               <p>"What is the name of this boy of Mrs. Dalton's?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"Gerald, uncle."</p>
               <p>"And I suppose you that trinket I saw you with the other day?"</p>
               <p>"gave him a sixpence with a hole in it, it was all I had to give," said Alice.</p>
               <p>"And both of you promised to keep these <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >souvenirs</foreign> as long as you lived, I'll be bound."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," replied Alice, innocently.</p>
               <p>"I thought so," replied her uncle, smiling, "I warrant that Gerald's sixpence was
                  spent for cakes or candy before he had been a week in London, though. Well, boys
                  and girls will do such things: but you must forget all about him now, as he has
                  doubtless long forgotten you."</p>
               <p>Alice did not reply. She did not believe that Gerald had forgotten her, but she
                  did not wish to offend her uncle, and with an adroitness beyond her years, she
                  changed the subject of conversation, and Gerald's name was not again
                  mentioned.</p>
               <p>The journey to Orleans occupied two days, and on arriving at that beautiful city,
                  Mr. Craddock engaged handsome apartments at a hotel for himself and his niece; and
                  in the course of the following week, placed her at school, in a convent, near the
                  city, at which the daughters of some of the most wealthy families in the province
                  were receiving their education. He desired that she should be taught and more
                  fashionable accomplishments, paying a very high price for her tuition, in advance.
                  He should be absent, he said for a year, at least, probably more; but if he did
                  remain longer away, the sum necessary for another year's tuition should be
                  promptly forwarded. No expense was to be spared, and his niece was to have the
                  utmost care and attention paid to her. None of the young ladies were allowed to go
                  beyond the convent grounds, unless sent for by their parents, nor was any
                  communication permitted with any person outside the convent. Mr. Craddock was very
                  peremptory in his orders that his niece should not be allowed to send any letters
                  to any one. "She is an orphan," he said to the Superior, "and has no friends with
                  whom I wish her to communicate. You will see that my wishes in this respect, are
                  strictly adhered to?"</p>
               <p>The promise was readily given: indeed, the Superior said that no letters were
                  allowed to be written by the young ladies except to their parents, and then the
                  contents of these letters were subjected to an examination by herself.</p>
               <p>"That is all I require," he replied. "Do your duty towards the child and you shall
                  have no cause to repent having done so."</p>
               <p>Before parting with his niece Mr. Craddock presented her<pb n="230-231"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000116"/> with a most liberal allowance of pocket money,
                  bidding her not to spare it, when, as was the case at certain seasons, female
                  peddlers were admitted within the convent grounds, for the gratification of the
                  young ladies. Alice was very anxious to know where her uncle was going; but all
                  the information she could obtain from him was very vague. "It is more than I can
                  say myself, my love," he said. "To the West Indies first, and then perhaps to the
                  United States. If I return direct But it is not improbable that I may go to India
                  again, in which case, I shall be absent for a much longer period: but you will be
                  well provided for, be this as it may."</p>
               <p>Alice was sorry to part with her uncle, for she was friendless in the world. and
                  he had used every endeavor to gain her affections, and in no instance had thwarted
                  her wishes since the day he had carried her from home, except in refusing to allow
                  her to correspond with Mrs. Dalton, and on occasion when he discovered in her
                  possession the portrait of Gerald Dalton.</p>
               <p>He was twelve months absent, and during that period she was a splendid prisoner
                  within the walls of the convent: still she was not unhappy. She enjoyed the
                  society of young ladies of her own age, had every opportunity afforded her to
                  progress in a variety of pleasing studies, and the grounds of the convent were
                  spacious. Well planted and supplied with everything requisite to the health and
                  amusement of the pupils. Only two things troubled her. She still sighed for a
                  opportunity of writing to Mrs. Dalton, and still cherished the recollection of
                  Gerald, and longed to know whether he cherished as fond and faithful a
                  recollection of her.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>In which the scene is changed, and some strange things occur after a strange
                     fashion.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AGAIN I change the locality of my story. Five years had elapsed since the
                  conversation, recorded in one early chapters of this narrative, had taken place
                  between Mrs. Dalton and Mr. Brower in the stage-coach, on their journey from
                  Liverpool to Derby, no the occasion of that lady's return to England from the
                  United States, when that gentlemen went back to America with the intention of
                  permanently residing there.</p>
               <p>He had written according to promise, to his brother at Cincinnati, a few weeks
                  after he had given the promise; but, little notice had been taken of his inquiries
                  respecting the piece of waste land that still remained the property of Mrs.
                  Dalton.—His brother had merely said, "The land you speak of, George, is really of
                  no value whatever, I would not have it as a gift. You are sanguine in your
                  anticipations of its future value. It may become so, as we advance in our internal
                  improvements; but I see no reason at present, to believe that it will be worth the
                  trifling taxes levied upon it, in our time or that of the widow," and Mr. Brower
                  had read the letter, and thought no more about it. But when he returned to the
                  United States and went to Cincinnati, his native city, he saw ample reasons to
                  believe that his anticipations would be realized sooner even than he expected.
                  Cincinnati was growing rapidly in size and<pb n="232-233"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000117"/> wealth. It had already acquired the proud
                  appellation of the "Queen city of the west." Canals were being constructed, and
                  already railroads that would intersect the state in all directions were seen in
                  the dim perspective. Before he had resided at home two years, he saw enough to
                  convince him that it would be a profitable investment were he to make the widow a
                  handsome offer for the land, even if it should be idle for years. He accordingly
                  wrote to Mr. Ashley's address in Herrington, which he still retained in his
                  possession, inclosing a letter for Mrs. Dalton, in which he honestly told her what
                  he thought of the property, and asked if she were inclined to sell it.</p>

                           <p>"I know not," he wrote, "whether you or your son have any idea of
                              returning to America. If you have I would not advise you to dispose of
                              this property. But if not, I will willingly purchase it from you at a
                              price fully equal to that which your late husband paid for his whole
                              farm. For two or three years yet, it will be no value tome; perhaps
                              for longer. It may be ten years before it is valuable; but the day
                              will come when it will be rented for wharfage and storage purposes,
                              and it will return a handsome income to its possessor. I am willing at
                              once, to take it off your hands. At the same time I will inform you
                              that it is believed that the owner is dead, as no claim has been made
                              upon it for years; the barn that stood upon it has been sold to pay
                              the arrears of taxes, and several squatter having settled upon
                              it—laborers on the canal—the State will probably shortly lay claim to
                              it; of course by proving your title deed, you can it any time reclaim
                              it; I would recommend you to empower me to hold it in your name.
                              Please advise with me at your earliest convenience—remember me to my

               <p>This letter reached England some time after Mr. Ashley had sailed for Ceylon; and
                  after having been returned to the dead letter office, in London, and lying there
                  for a long time, it was on the point of being returned to the writer, when by some
                  means Mr. Ashley's address became known, and it was mailed to the East Indies, but
                  it was again delayed, having, through some blunder, been sent to Singapore instead
                  of Ceylon, It was returned to England, and again re-mailed to Colombo, and finally
                  receive by Mr. Ashley nearly three years after it was written, and encumbered with
                  postage charges to a very large amount. Even then he knew nothing of the contents
                  of Mrs. Dalton's letter, the envelope in which it was enclosed merely instructing
                  him to forward the letter to Mrs. Dalton's address, and stating that it came from
                  Gerald Brower. Mr. Ashley puzzled his brains for some time in the endeavor to
                  recollect who Gerald Brower was; and at length recalled to mind his
                  fellow-passenger in the stage-coach, some years previous. All that remained to him
                  was to re-mail the letter again to Mrs. Dalton, who did not receive it until
                  Gerald had sailed for India.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Brower having no reply to his letter, either from Mr. Ashley or the
                  widow, or her son, supposed them to be dead, or removed, as was the case, to some
                  other locality and he had acted in the matter upon his own responsibility. Having
                  informed the proper authorities of all that he knew in relation to the owners of
                  the property, and stated that he believed them to be dead—he had rented it of the
                  State, which held it in trust for the rightful owner. The canal which passed near
                  it was already nearly completed, and storehouses and wharves were already in the
                  course of erection upon it. It already paid a handsome rental, and bade fair in
                  the course of a few years more to become very valuable property.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dalton, upon the receipt of the letter, wrote to Mr. Brower, thanking him for
                  the trouble he had taken, but declining<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7199-00000118"/>
                  clining to give any decisive answer until she had advised with her son, who she
                  wrote, was in the East Indies, but whom she expected home in the course of six or
                  eight moths.</p>
               <p>Greatly to her surprise and gratification, she received a second letter from Mr.
                  Brower, in the course of three months, enclosing a bill of exchange for the value
                  of the rents already received by the State, and asking her for a power of
                  attorney, by which he might act in her behalf for the future. His anticipations,
                  he wrote, promised to be more than realized and he no longer advised her, since
                  son was living, to dispose of the property. His request was thankfully complied
                  with by the widow, who looked from abroad. It was but a short time after this that
                  she received a letter from him, informing her of the unfortunate result of his
                  visit to Calcutta, and of his intentions to remain for some time in the East
                  Indies.</p>
               <p>She wrote to him, that she had heard form Mr. Brower, and had some good news to
                  communicate to him when she saw him. She was silent with regard to its character,
                  for she knew Gerald's impetuous disposition, and was fearful if she told him all,
                  that he would take it into his head to go to America before he returned home to
                  her. Her over caution defeated itself, as will be seen hereafter.</p>
               <p>Shortly after this she also received a letter in the well remembered handwriting
                  of Alice Thornton. It bore no date, but was stamped with the Paris post-mark, and
                  ran as follows:</p>

                              for more than twelve month at school in the interior of this country,
                              during which period I have had no communication with any one outside
                              the institution in which I received my education. It is only at my
                              urgent request before leaving France for another country, which I am
                              not permitted to name, that I another country, which I am no permitted
                              to name, that I have obtained permission to write at all; and now I am
                              writing under the eye of a relative, who will read my letter before I
                              seal it—indeed, it is party from hi dictation that I am writing. Some
                              day he tells me you shall know all, but not now. It is only within the
                              last month, since I have left school, that the causes which led to my
                              removal from your charge have been explained to me; still do not think
                              that I am unhappy, or that beyond my inability to write to you before,
                              I have any cause to complain. I am indeed rich in this world's goods,
                              or at least I shall be, in the course of time, if I live. Meanwhile, I
                              am abundantly supplied with money, in proof of which I in-close you
                              the accompanying trifle, which I am promised shall be transmitted to
                              you, annually. I shall probably write to you again, but I am not
                              permitted to give you any clue to my place have left Pairs before you
                              receive this.</p>

               <p>The trifle enclosed in the letter was a fifty pound Bank of England note.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dalton read the letter again and again, with the utmost interest: but
                  although she was delighted to know that Alice still lived, it was with feelings of
                  the deepest regret that she heard from her own hand that she would probably never
                  see her again. So far from explaining the mystery connected with<pb n="236-237"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000119"/> her disappearance, the letter, only rendered it
                  deeper, ad left no a hope of future explanation.</p>
               <p>Another thing also distressed the widow. Alice had made no inquiries after Gerald.
                  She had not even mentioned his name!</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dalton was not of course aware that she had been forbidden to do so, and
                  knowing how deeply Gerald mourned her loss and how fondly he still loved, her she
                  thought this apparently purposed omission heartless and cruel. She resolved to say
                  nothing to Gerald about it until his return, further than to inform him her next
                  letter of the fact that Alice was still alive and had written to her.</p>

                  <p>Misrepresentations and their results. The evil effects of false pride again
                     exemplified.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>GERALD was absent for nine moths on the voyage amongst the Islands of the Indian
                  Archipelago. During this period he visited Borneo, the Phillipine Islands,
                  Singapore, Pulo Penang, and a score of is Islands of lesser note. Had his mind
                  been easy in relation to matters at home, the voyage, notwithstanding the menial
                  situation he held, would have been an interesting one to him. In many respects it
                  was so after all. He had shown himself active and willing, and it soon becoming
                  apparent that he had received a better education than usually falls to the lot of
                  common seamen, his captain who was not overstocked with education himself,
                  released him from much of the menial drudgery which he would otherwise have been
                  compelled to perform, and appointed him duties of importance and trust, especially
                  when the brig was at anchor or lying off the islands. He had called at Borneo for
                  the purpose of purchasing wild horses for sale in the Phillipines, and Gerald was
                  generally deputed to exercise the office of ship's clerk and to keep an account of
                  the expenditures and of the amount of the sales that were made, and in this duty
                  he acquitted himself so well that at the expiration of the voyage, on the
                  commendation presented him with a considerable addition to his wages, and offered
                  him the situation of supercargo during the next voyage to ceylon. It was Gerald's
                  intention to remain for some time with his uncle at Colombo, provided the<pb
                     n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7199-00000120"/> he found himself well received, and he
                  represented this to the owners and received their permission to leave the brig at
                  Trin-comallee, and to proceed thence top Colombo. His wages, with the compliment
                  he had received and the commission he hoped to make on arriving at Ceylon, would
                  place him in possession of a considerable sum of money and he was gratified to
                  think that, at any rate, he would not visit his relatives as a beggar, intruding
                  upon their hospitality.</p>
               <p>His great anxiety, however, on returning to Calcutta had relation to the letters
                  he expected to find awaiting him there, and he lost no time in calling upon Mr.
                  Hoffamnn, one from his mother, and one from the Vicar of Herrington.</p>
               <p>It was with a beating heart that he opened the second letter; but it s contents
                  threw him into an agony of grief and rage.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dalton had received a letter from Mr. Hoffmann, before she had written to her
                  some, and it was evident to Gerald that the unfortunate results which had attended
                  the sale of the merchandise entrusted to his charge, had been grossly
                  misrepresented to hi mother.</p>
               <p>The letter was couched in affectionate language, and he was earnestly entreated to
                  return home, when all, she said, would be forgotten and forgiven. She was sorry
                  that he had been led astray, nut she hoped he had not intentionally done wrong,
                  She believed that he hod been duped by designing persons, and so had yielded to a
                  temptation that he could have strength to resist in future; and she thought if he
                  were to write penitent letter to Mr. Hoffmann, he would look over what was passed
                  and could not be recalled, although she heard that his friends had suffered a
                  heavy pecuniary loss. The letter concluded with earnestly earnestly entreating him
                  for his mother' sake, to recollect the lessons he had received from in his
                  childhood, and the prayers he had been taught to repeat at his mother's knee; and
                  she begged him earnestly to pray that henceforward he might be enabled to resist
                  temptation or to fly from its first approach—but erring or penitent, he was
                  assured that he still possessed, and would ever continue to possess his mother's
                  fondest affection.</p>
               <p>Gerld fairly gnashed his teeth with rage ad distress when he had finished the
                  perusal of this letter. "All will be forgotten and forgiven!" he said. "This from
                  my mother. A curse fall on those who have endeavored turn her against me, The
                  fools! they were alone to blame in sending out such a lot of trash, and in
                  greedily affixing such absurd prices to their useless merchandise. I did my best,
                  God knows, and if I failed, it was thorough no fault that I could avoid, except
                  that of placing too much confidence in their judgement, and in De Sylva's
                  probity.</p>
               <p>"But this letter has fixed me in my resolve. I will not return home, until I have
                  brought them, aye, and my mother too to confess that I have been grievously
                  wronged."</p>
               <p>He had scarely patience to read Mr. Hoffmann's letter. It was full of
                  recriminations and not only charged him, indirectly with having sold the goods at
                  higher prices than he had rendered an account of, and of making use of the money
                  for his own purposes; also with writing with a degree of levity and flippancy,
                  after having so recklessly robbed those whose chief motive had been to befriend
                  him and advance his interest. It was signed by very one of the persons whose goods
                  had been entrusted to his care.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pierce's letter, like that written by his mother, was couched in a strain of
                  mingled warning, commiseration and regret, having evidently been penned rather in
                  sorrow than in anger—that wounded the feelings of the young man far more than the
                  angry and reproachful letters, and would perhaps have turned home, as they urged
                  him to do, had not the bitter invective of Mr. Hoffmann excited his anger to such
                  a degree that when his thought again recurred to it, he strove<pb n="240-241"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000121"/> to banish from his mind every feelings of regret,
                  and almost felt inclined, since his actions had been so misinterpreted, to give
                  late employer some good cause for condemnation: better thoughts, however, happily
                  prevailed over his first feelings of pride and passion, although he was more than
                  ever determined to becoming an alien to his home until those who had judged him
                  wrongfully, freely acknowledged their injustice.</p>
               <p>The only reply he deigned to Mr. Hoffmann was to obtain from the Portuguese
                  merchant an account of the sale, <emph>in Hindoostane,</emph> and to transmit it
                  without further explanation than the insulting statement that he had sent him a
                  bill of the prices obtained for the goods, and he and his friends might make the
                  best they could of it.</p>
               <p>To the vicar and his mother he wrote briefly, and with some bitterness of feeling,
                  though he said that he believed they had been misled by the false representations
                  of Mr. Hoffmann, and he informed the latter that she probably would not see him
                  again until she was satisfied that he had been harshly treated and unjustly
                  suspected.</p>
               <p>It would have been, well, if amidst the bitter and vindictive feelings of pride
                  and obstinancy which agitated his bosom, he had recollected the advice of honest
                  Jemmy Milton, given him on the beach, on the occasion of his first visit to
                  Herrington, after he had quitted that town to go to the situation procured for him
                  in London: "Don't go agin your mother, Gerry, if you wants to have luck in this
                  world, and to mount up'ards when your time comes."</p>
               <p>Having again requested Mr. Thompson to retain any letters that he might receive
                  for him, until sent directions where they were to to be forwarded, he sailed a
                  supercargo on board the Firefly, for Trincomallee.</p>

                  <p>In which Mr. Craddock makes a long and strange explanation, which Alice listens

               </argument>
               <p>SOME eighteen months after Alice Thornton had been abducted from Herrington, a
                  middle-aged gentleman, and a young lady, who might well have passed for eighteen
                  years of age, but who was in reality nearly twenty, were seated, one evening in
                  the verandah of one of the graceful country seats that are scattered along the
                  coast in the vicinity of Havana, in the Island of Cuba. The villa was situated in
                  the centre of a delightful sugar plantation, which covered a hundred
                     <foreign>cabalerias</foreign> of land. The grounds immediately surrounding the
                  dwelling planted with shrubbery and with ornamental trees, among which, the royal
                  palm, the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">oreodoxia regia</foreign> of Humboldt, was
                  conspicuous; its, fresh glossy green leaves contrasted beautifully with its
                  whitish-brown trunk;. orange and lemon trees, whose rich sweet-scented blossoms
                  filled the atmosphere with their grateful perfume, and glowers of every variety in
                  bud and blossom, gave additional beauty and sweetness to the landscape. The cool
                  evening breeze was blowing gently from seaward, and wafting the perfume of the
                  flowers into the verandah, the view from which was so gloriously beautiful, that
                  the young lady uttered an involuntary exclamation of delight.</p>
               <p>The gentleman, who had for some minutes been observing her in silence, appeared
                  pleased with this evidence of admiration on the part of his youthful
                  companion.</p>
               <p>"It is, indeed, beautiful, Alice," he said; "and all this broad land will one day
                  be yours."</p>
               <pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7199-00000122"/>
               <p>"Mine, uncle!" exclaimed the young lady.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Alice, yours, on the day that you complete your twenty-first year, provide
                  you do not, in one respect, thwart my wishes."</p>
               <p>Alice made no reply, although Mr. Craddock waited some moments in expectation;
                  but, at length he continued:—</p>
               <p>"I promised you, my love, when I took you from the convent school, at Orleans,
                  that when we arrived in Cuba, I would explain the causes which led me to seek you
                  out in England, and more fully to take such an interest in your welfare. Of
                  course, as your existing to some extent; but you must be well aware that I have
                  had other reasons, or I should not have adopted so singular a method of carrying
                  out my views. We have been now three weeks in Cuba. In the course of a few days I
                  expect your cousin, George, to arrive from Jamaica. I sent for him the day after
                  we landed, and I will, this evening, relate to you, if you please, the history of
                  your family of which, in consequence of the early death of your parents, you
                  appear to have remained ignorant."</p>
               <p>Still Alice remained silent. She appeared to dread the story, which she was yet so
                  anxious to hear.</p>
               <p>Mr. Craddock seemed to consider her silence a token of consent, and thus
                  continued:</p>
               <p>"You are not aware that your mother was born on this Island?"</p>
               <p>"Of course not. How should you have known, if your former friends in England never
                  knew anything of your mother's family? It was foolish of me to ask you the
                  question. Such, however, was the case; she was several years younger than I, and
                  was born here shortly after I came here with my father and mother from
                  Ireland.</p>
               <p>"Your father, I knew when a boy; he having also came here with his parents from
                  England about the same time. His father and mine were engaged by the Cuban
                  Government as Surveyors and Civil Engineer; but Mr. Thornton died of yellow fever,
                  and his wife followed him to the death of hr husband. My father and mother took
                  him into the family after the death of his parents, and he and I were educated to
                  gether here, until, at the age of fourteen,. we both went to England, he to a
                  grammar school, and I to the Cadet's College at Croydon. My father, who had some
                  influence with the East India Company's Directors, having procured me the promise
                  of a military appointment in the East India Company's service. At the age of
                  sixteen, I left England for the East Indies, and did not again return to England
                  until the period I met with you at Herrington.</p>
               <p>"Your father after he quitted school, when eighteen years of age, returned to
                  Cuba, and resided there a year. He had succeeded in gaining the affections of your
                  mother, my sister; but her parents being opposed to their union, they were married
                  clandestinely. Henry Thornton, your father, having secretly followed Alice, your
                  mother, to Jamaica, whither she had gone on visit to some friends, and there he
                  succeeded in getting the marriage ceremony performed.</p>
               <p>"Your grandfather was greatly irritated when he heard of this act of disobedience
                  on the part of his daughter. He refused to received or even to see the newly
                  married pair, and declared his intention of discarding his daughter. All your
                  grandmother's endeavors to bring about a reconciliation, although she was herself
                  opposed to the match, were of no avail, and your father and mother sailed for
                  England; your father, who was always seriously inclined, intending to study at oe
                  of the colleges with a view of becoming a minister of the gospel. He had 500 which
                  had been left him by his mother, and this sum constituted his whole fortune.</p>
               <p>"Shortly after their arrival in England, your were born,<pb n="244-245"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000123"/> and within a few months your mother died. She had
                  been much grieved with the anger of her father; this grief, no doubt hastened her
                  death.</p>
               <p>"Your father died when you were about three years of age, and Mr. Ashley, who had
                  been his fellow student at college, but who had married and taken holy orders,
                  adopted you into his family. From that period until I took you from England you, I
                  presume, recollect all that occurred.</p>
               <p>"Your mother had frequently written to her parents, but her letters had not been
                  answered. After her death your father wrote them the sad intelligence, and to this
                  letter he received a reply, requesting him to send you to Cuba, and on his
                  compliance with this request, promising to provide comfortably for him; but
                  otherwise declining any further correspondence.</p>
               <p>"From that date no more letters passed between them.</p>
               <p>"My parents, your grandfather and grandmother, wished me to wed the daughter of a
                  neighboring planter; and after I had been some years in India, I received a letter
                  requesting me to obtain a furlough, and return home and marry this young lady.</p>
               <p>"The letter reached me too late. I had already married the daughter of one of the
                  captains of the regiment to which I belonged. I had known Donna Julia, my
                  affiance, on this island, when a girl, and I knew that it had been the wish of the
                  parents of both of us that we should be married when we arrived at the proper age;
                  but I had never cared for her, though she was a beautiful and amiable girl, nor, I
                  believe had she cared for me—probably because we had been always told that we were
                  to marry each other. Still had I not fallen in with the lady whom I married, I
                  should not have opposed the wishes of my parents.</p>
               <p>"My father was very much exasperated when he heard that his designs for his
                  children had again been thwarted. He was a man of very irritable temper, and he
                  wrote me a letter telling ing me that he had altogether cast me off and erased my
                  name form his will.</p>
               <p>"I was sorry for this, not, however, in a pecuniary point of view, for I was young
                  then and careless of money; besides I was rising in my profession, and my
                  father-in-law was a man of considerable wealth; but I deeply regretted having
                  offend my parents, although I would not have undone what was done, even if I had
                  possessed the power. I wrote to my father and mother expressing my sorrow, and
                  begging to be restored to favor; but I received no reply; before the letter
                  reached them both had died. The executor of the estate, however, wrote to inform
                  me that my name had been erased from the will, and the name of Alice Thornton, the
                  daughter of Henry Thornton and Alice Craddock substituted in its place as sole
                  heir. He endeavored to console me, however, by informing me that the title to the
                  property was contested by the heirs of a former possessor, and that a long course
                  of litigation would ensue, and that in all probability the result would be the
                  loss of the estate to my family.</p>
               <p>"Several years elapsed, during which period your Cousin George was born. I
                  continued to take an interest in whatever occurred in Cuba, and occasionally
                  received the Havana newspapers, in which, from time to time, at long intervals, I
                  read the tedious proceedings of the legal contest between my father's executor and
                  the rival claimants.</p>
               <p>"At last, a short time before I quitted India, to my surprise I received a
                  newspaper from which I learnt that the claim had been decided in favor of the
                  heirs of Mr. Craddock. The will was published, and an advertisement inserted
                  calling for information of Alice Thornton, grand-daughter of William and Alice
                  Craddock, formerly fo Dublin, Ireland, and subsequently of Regla, in the Island of
                  Cuba, and of William Craddock, of the Hon. Company's service, son of the aforesaid
                  William and Alice Craddock, supposed to be in the East Indies.</p>
               <p>"The Will I read carefully. It was to the following effect. To wit:</p>
               <pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7199-00000124"/>
               <p>"The property, consisting of this estate and another of equal value on the south
                  side of the island, was left to Alice Thornton and her heirs forever; provided, In
                  the case of William Craddock having male issue living, the said Alice Thornton
                  wedded one of the said male issue. In case of her refusal or decease, the property
                  was to fall to the said William Craddock personally."</p>
               <p>"I knew that you, my love, had been adopted by Mr. Ashley, and some short time
                  before this I had read in the Bengal newspapers of Mr. Ashley's appointment to an
                  Educational post in Ceylon.</p>
               <p>"My term of service in India had expired, and my wife having died some years
                  before, I had sent my son George to Jamaica to receive his education, as I have
                  friends there, and having no ties to bind me to India, I had resolved to return to
                  England and send for my son to rejoin me from Jamaica. This welcome and unexpected
                  intelligence however altered my plans, and I went to Ceylon to seek for you. I
                  found Mr. Ashley and heard from him that you were residing at Herrington, in
                  England, with one Mrs. Dalton. Mr. Ashley was very eager in his inquiries as to
                  the cause of my anxiety regarding you, but I had no desire to give him all the
                  information he sought, and in some respects I plead guilty to having misled him. I
                  however, returned to England and you know the rest.</p>
               <p>"My object in acting as I have done I need scarely explain further. I heard from
                  Mr. Ashley that Mrs. Dalton had a son about your own age, and I feared the
                  consequences of your being together, knowing how much depended upon your marriage
                  with your cousin George, and I feared there might be delay and difficulty if I
                  sought Mrs. Dalton and demanded that you should be given up to my
                  guardianship.</p>
               <p>"Again, I wished you to be entirely separated from your former friends, and I
                  think, now I have explained my motives, you will confess that I was right.</p>
               <p>"I was glad to find that you never mentioned the name of Mrs. Dalton's son.</p>
               <p>"Only once I was annoyed at seeing in your possession a miniature which he had
                  given you. You know that I replaced it with another—the portrait of your Cousin
                  George. I hope that the silly bauble I complained of has long ago been destroyed
                  and forgotten. In a few days you will see the original of the miniature you have
                  since worn.</p>
               <p>"I forgot to say that while you were at school in France, I visited Cuba and
                  obtained possession of the will and saw that everything was settled. It is your
                  fault if on your twenty-first birth-day, you do not inherit the beautiful estate
                  upon which we now reside; but it is growing late, my love, and the night air is
                  somewhat chilly, and you are not yet accustomed to the climate. You had better
                  retire to rest. Good night and pleasant dreams attend your slumbers."</p>
               <p>Mr. Craddock rose from his seat, and lighting a cigar, commenced pacing leisurely
                  up and down the verandah, and Alice, wishing her uncle good night, acceded to his
                  request and retired to her apartment.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>In which the reader obtains some inkling of the motives which actuated Mr.
                     Craddock, and in which Alice and her cousin came to a mutual understanding.
                     Showing also what was the result.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>"My uncle speaks kindly and disinterestedly," soliloquized Alice, as she laid
                  aside the miniature she had withdrawn from its hiding-place, and carefully locked
                  the drawer; "still I cannot understand his motives. Surely it is a singular
                  disinterestedness which would lead him to urge me to consent to marry my cousin,
                  whom I have not yet seen, when, by my refusal, would secure the whole estate to
                  himself. What need of this secrecy if the Will be worded as he says it is? I shall
                  displease rible in his anger; but I will ask to see this Will. He cannot refuse me
                  that permission—It is my right; and then I shall know better how to act. As to my
                  cousin George, he is handsome, if the miniature my uncle gave me, resembles him;
                  and he is said to be amiable and intelligent, but I know I shall hate him,
                  notwithstanding. My uncle can have no legal authority over me, and he shall not
                  force me to marry against my inclination."</p>
               <p>She sat for hours deeply absorbed in thought; then undressed, and got into bed,
                  and fatigued as she had been with the unwonted exertions of the previous day,
                  during which, in company with her uncle, she had ridden over the plantation, and
                  extended the jaunt far into the interior of the island, she soon fell asleep, but
                  her slumbers were disturbed and restless—her dreams took the color of her wakeful
                  thought. She was again in England, walking on the sea-beach, near Herrington, with
                  Gerald—again standing in the court-yard of the inn, bidding him farewell, as the
                  stage drove away from the yard—again she passed through the agonies of mind
                  consequent upon her abduction from her friends—she was again on board the Calais
                  packet—in Paris—in the convent school at Orleans; yet amidst all these changing
                  visions, her cousin George and her uncle were present, urging her to consent to a
                  union, against which her heart revolted.</p>
               <p>Then a change came over the spirit of her dream. She saw before her an old trunk,
                  which a strong curiosity prompted her to open and to examine the contents, but it
                  was locked, and the key was not to be found. She tried all the keys she had in her
                  possession, and the last one on the bunch fitted the lock. She opened the trunk,
                  and there lay the Will. She started and looked up in his face; there was the same
                  fearful scowl on his visage, that only once or twice she had seen, yet which had
                  struck terror to her heart. He laid his hand upon her shoulder, as if about to
                  drag her away forcibly. She screamed, and awoke to find her French maid standing
                  by the bed-side. It was her touch which had awakened her.</p>
               <p>"Levez vous ma'mselle," said the young woman, who was accustomed to make very free
                  with her mistress. "II est trestard, le dejeuner est servi."</p>
               <p>"Quelle heure est il, done? Minette," said Alice, springing out of bed.</p>
               <p>"II est sept heure, ma'mselle, mais vous paraissez indispose ce matin. Est-ce que
                  vous n'avez pas bien dormi, vous?"</p>
               <p>"Pas trop bien Minette, j'ai fait des reves affreux. Je crains de m'etre trop
                  fatigué, hier, mais dites a mon oncle que je descendrais toute de suite."</p>
               <pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7199-00000126"/>
               <p>Minette quitted the chamber to carry the message to Mr. Craddock, who was
                  impatiently waiting at the breakfast table for his niece's appearance, and Alice
                  having hastily made her morning toilet, shortly joined her uncle, who was, as
                  usual, all courtesy and attention. He did not make any allusion to the
                  conversation of the previous evening, and Alice had been so terrified with her
                  dream, that she did not dare to introduce the subject of the Will, as she had
                  resolved to do, before she slept.</p>
               <p>After breakfast, her uncle proposed a ride in a different direction from that they
                  had taken the day before. To this arrangement Alice willingly consented, and on
                  their return, Mr. Craddock exerted himself to find other amusements for her. Thus,
                  with reading, music, and conversation, the time would have passed pleasantly
                  enough had not Alice been possessed with a foreboding that some trouble was
                  hanging over, which might descend at any moment, and she dreaded, while she
                  anxiously looked for the arrival of her cousin from Jamaica.</p>
               <p>A few mornings after, she was again awakened from her slumbers by Minette, whose
                  countenance sufficiently expressed that she was the bearer of what she thought
                  would be welcome intelligence.</p>
               <p>"Ma'mselle does not know that a surprise awaits her, en bas," she said, in the odd
                  mixture of French and English, which she was accustomed to use when she imagined
                  she was speaking the latter language—"all same comme un natif," as she was used to
                  say.</p>
               <p>"No, Minette; what is it?" inquired Alice.</p>
               <p>"Mam,'selle's cousin, George, has arrive. Ah! he is so fine, un si bel homme; but
                  ma'mselle is not overjoyed."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, I am very glad, Minette," said Alice, though her pale face denied her
                  words.</p>
               <p>"Haste, then, et vous habillez vous ma'mselle, Mr. Craddock et votre cousin, await
                  le dejeuner."</p>
               <p>"I will soon attend them, Minette. You can tell them so. I shall not need any
                  assistance to dress."</p>
               <p>Minette went down stairs with her message, and was soon followed by Alice, who, on
                  tapping nervously at the door of the breakfast-room, was received by her uncle,
                  and presented to the cousin, of whom she had heard so much.</p>
               <p>The young man rose from his seat, and advancing, took his cousin's hand; at the
                  same time expressing his pleasure in seeing her.</p>
               <p>He was a remarkably handsome youth of about the same age as Alice, and had she met
                  him under any other circumstances, she could scarcely have helped being pleased
                  with him, but now her expressions of pleasure were constrained, and she was so
                  nervous that it was with difficulty she could maintain the appearance of
                  satisfaction that she felt herself called upon to assume.</p>
               <p>She would have recognized him any where from his resemblance tot he miniature,
                  although he was now a young man, and that was the portrait of a child; but there
                  were the same earnest dark eyes, and black curling hair, and oval contour of
                  visage, and the same clear olive complexion which he had inherited from his mother
                  who was of Creole descent, Captain Fortesque having married into a Hindoo family
                  of high caste, and considerable wealth, that had embraced Christianity.</p>
               <p>After breakfast Mr. Craddock proposed that the young people should ride out
                  together, and that Alice should enact the part of <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >cicerone</foreign> to her cousin, as he had business of importance on hand
                  which would require his attention at home.</p>
               <p>Alice could not well have objected even had she been desirous of so doing, and
                  together they rode over the plantation. During the ride she found that her
                  cousin's good qualities had not been misrepresented. He was refined, intelligent,
                  and conversationable, and, so far as she could judge, appeared to possess an
                  excellent disposition. They both returned from their ride in good spirits, and Mr.
                  Craddock, who watched his niece narrowly though cautiously, appeared to be
                  perfectly satisfied with his experiment in bringing them together. From that
                     period,<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7199-00000127"/> for the month George
                  remained at home, he always accompanied her in her rambles, and assisted in her
                  amusements and recreations within doors. Mr. Craddock although he occasionally
                  joined the party, still professing to be closely engaged in business.</p>
               <p>At the end of this period George Craddock was to return for twelve months to
                  Jamaica After breakfast the day before his departure from Cuba, his father desired
                  him to attend him to his study.</p>
               <p>"I trust you will be able to dispense with your customary jaunt this morning.
                  Alice," he said, smilingly addressing his niece. "You know George leaves us
                  to-morrow, and I have some little affairs of business to arrange with him."</p>
               <p>Alice willingly assented, and Mr. Craddock and his son adjourned to the study,
                  leaving the young lady in the breakfast saloon.</p>
               <p>"George," said Mr. Craddock, when they were seated in the study, "you return
                  to-morrow t Jamaica for twelve months, and at the end of that period you will come
                  back to remain here. It is my wish that you should marry and settle down on the
                  estate. Have you any objection to make to this arrangement?"</p>
               <p>"None, whatever, sir," replied the young man, "provided the lady whom I marry
                  shall be one of my own choosing."</p>
               <p>"Then," said Mr. Craddock, "I think there is no difficulty to be anticipated. You
                  have been much in the company of your cousin Alice since you have been here, and
                  from what I have observed I have no reason to believe that she is distasteful to
                  you. She is the young lady whom I hope to see your wife as soon as you have both
                  obtained your majority. What say you to this arrangement?"</p>
               <p>The young man made no reply.</p>
               <p>"Answer me, George," continued his father, observing his son's hesitation. "Have
                  you any objection to make to my proposition?"</p>
               <p>"The young lady, herself, may object, sir," replied the youth.</p>
               <p>"That is not to the point, George. Although if that be all I do not think there is
                  much probability of it. You, I presume, have no objection. I therefore shall
                  myself speak to Alice, in your presence, this afternoon, and shall then leave you
                  together. I shall consider the matter settled. This is all that I wished to speak
                  to you about. You can now go and rejoin Alice. After dinner I will see both
                  together."</p>
               <p>"I beg, sir," said George, "that you will not introduce the subject before Alice.
                  At least, not in my presence."</p>
               <p>"And pray, why not, sir?" said Mr. Craddock.</p>
               <p>"Because, father, we have already spoken of it."</p>
               <p>"Oh ho!" exclaimed Mr. Craddock in high glee, "you have been beforehand with me,
                  eh? Well I might have anticipated that, and I am glad of it. It will save a great
                  deal of trouble; but I don't see why I should be debarred from a knowledge of the
                  arrangements that you young folks have arrived at."</p>
               <p>"We have not made any arrangements, sir," said the young man, much
                  embarrassed.</p>
               <p>"Well, then, so much the more reason, George, that I should assist you give my
                  sanction to your engagement. I do not particularly desire that you shall be
                  married before you have reached the age of twenty-one still, if you are both
                  agreeable, I will not interpose any obstacle to a more speedy union."</p>
               <p>"You mistake me sir," said the young man, "We have entered into no engagements,
                  nor have we thought of anything of the kind."</p>
               <p>"What do you mean, then, sir, by saying that you have conferred together upon the
                  subject?" inquired Mr. Craddock in an angry tone. "You sir, I presume," he
                  continued sarcastically, "have no prior engagement? and the young lady I think I
                  can answer for myself."</p>
               <p>"Father," said the young man, "since I have been here I have spent much of my time
                  with my cousin Alice, and I acknowledge to have seen much to admire, much to love
                  in her<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7199-00000128"/> character and disposition. I
                  have admire her and should perhaps have learnt to love her, had she not intimated
                  to me one day—the second day we spent in each other's company—when I playfully
                  introduced the subject of marriage, that her affections were already engaged. She
                  said it might seem like boldness on so short an intimacy as ours to make such a
                  confession but she had particular reasons for so doing, and I then informed her
                  that I too entertained a partiality for a young lady whom I had met in
                  Jamaica."</p>
               <p>"Upon my word, sir," said Mr. Craddock, "this is a very pretty mutual confession,
                  and who pray, is the young lady of whom you speak?"</p>
               <p>"Miss Mary Barton, sir, the daughter of the Deputy Commissary General at
                  Kingston."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! and you have proposed to her?"</p>
               <p>"No sir, I have seen her but a few times and might have transferred my partiality
                  to my cousin Alice, had she not confided to me what she had done. As regards Miss
                  Barton and myself, I should not have thought seriously of asking her hand without
                  first informing you."</p>
               <p>"Very dutiful, indeed, sir! but permit me to ask you one more question. What is
                  the name of the gentleman to whom your cousin Alice has engaged her
                  affections?"</p>
               <p>"Father, I cannot reply to that question. It would neither be honorable nor
                  delicate in me to do so."</p>
               <p>"But I know who he is," said Mr. Craddock, in a towering passion. "His name is
                  Gerald Dalton. A paltry tradesman's apprentice in London—a beggar, and worse for
                  aught I know; but she shall never see him again if I have to shut her up in a
                  convent for life; and you, sir, discard all idea of marrying this Mary
                  Barton—whoever she be. It is my wish, my demand that you wed your cousin Alice
                  Thornton, and if I am disobeyed, you know me well enough to fear my anger. I shall
                  disown you as my son—and not one dollar of my property shall ever be yours. You
                  shall become a beggar, sir,—a beggar, spurned from your father's door, if you
                  venture near to ask an alms——"</p>
               <p>"I hope, sir," said the youth, his indignation aroused by this tirade of
                  passionate abuse, "that I have ability and energy enough to earn my own living,
                  even if I were visited with the severe displeasure you threaten, and if such
                  should not be the case I would not seek charity at the door of my father's
                  house."</p>
               <p>"Silence, sir," thundered Mr. Craddock, "leave my presence and think over what I
                  have said, and when you have come to a wiser conclusion we will speak of this
                  matter again. Meanwhile, I will deal with this disobedient girl."</p>
               <p>The young man left the room without replying, and Mr. Craddock shortly after rang
                  for the attendance of a servant, whom he ordered to request Miss Thornton's
                  immediate attendance in the study.</p>
               <p>Alice, who had entertained some suspicion of the cause of the private interview
                  between her uncle and cousin, received this message with ill disguised alarm.</p>
               <p>"Where is Senor George?" she demanded of the servant in the best Spanish she could
                  master.</p>
               <p>"Jo no se' Senorita," replied the negro. "He has just left Senor Craddock's room.
                  The Senor wishes to see the Senorita immediately."</p>
               <p>Alice obeyed the mandate and went immediately to the study.</p>
               <p>"Come in," said Mr. Craddock, in answer to her faltering tap at the door. The dark
                  frown was on his brow when the young lady entered; but her endeavored to assume
                  his usual suavity of manner, as he rose and offered her a chair.</p>
               <p>"I have sent for you Alice, my love?" he said, "to ask an explanation of a
                  conversation which, I am informed by my son George, took place between you and he
                  a day or two after his arrival from Jamaica."</p>
               <p>"I do not know, uncle, to what you particularly refer,"<pb n="256-257"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000129"/> tremblingly replied the young lady, "we have
                  discoursed on so many and such different subjects."</p>
               <p>"Alice," said Mr. Craddock, sternly, "this is subterfuge on your part. You well
                  know to what conversation I allude. We have spoken together upon the subject ere
                  now. However, since your bashfulness perhaps, prompts you to pretend ignorance, I
                  will explain that to which I refer. It was a conversation relative to some special
                  engagement you had made, with a view hereafter to matrimony. Rather a delicate
                  subject, allow me to inform you, to be the theme of conversation between two young
                  people like you and George."</p>
               <p>"I cannot explain, uncle, indeed," replied the young lady. "But a few words were
                  said by either of us, and my cousin it appears, has informed you of their
                  import?"</p>
               <p>"He has, Miss," said Mr. Craddock, losing his assumed patience and good temper. "I
                  only sent for you that I might have his words corroborated from your own lips. I
                  know perfectly well who the person is to whom you alluded. It is that beggar
                  Gerald Dalton, with whom you had the misfortune to be brought up in early life,
                  before I rescued you from your low associations in Herrington. I have been led to
                  hops that your good sense had long ago led you to forget them, and him. When I
                  permitted you to write to Mrs. Dalton, and to send her a bank note, I trusted that
                  henceforward all communication between you would cease except the annual gift
                  which I promised you you should transmit her. Since, however, you have thus abused
                  my generosity, I shall withdraw that favor. You know that I wish you to marry your
                  cousin. You are aware of the benefits that will accrue to yourself by so doing;
                  and I am resolved, on my part, that my wishes shall be carried out, or I will take
                  other measures that will punish you for your contumacy and prevent you from ever
                  again seeing or even holding communication with any of the low-bred set who have
                  gained such an ascendancy over you. George leaves for Jamaica to-morrow. I give
                  you till then to make up your mind; after that I shall decide for myself, and my
                  decision will be irrevocable."</p>
               <p>"Uncle," said Alice, finally, "my decision is already made, and my cousin George,
                  whom I highly esteem, is aware of it. It is needless for me to explain it to you
                  since you already know to what I allude."</p>
               <p>"Think over what I have just said, Alice," continued Mr. Craddock, striving to
                  control his rising passion. "Perhaps to-morrow your good sense will induce you to
                  change your mind. Think of your loss of fortune; of the indigence that awaits you
                  if you continue to oppose my wishes for your welfare; and then let me know, if you
                  still continue to cherish affection of one who has doubtless, ere this, forgotten
                  that you ever existed. You have your choice, fortune and happiness, and my favor,
                  or my repudiation, and poverty, and wretchedness—"or, dropping his voice, "what is
                  perhaps still less endurable—life-long seclusion."</p>
               <p>"Uncle," replied Alice, gaining courage from despair, "you have told me of a Will,
                  dictated by relatives whom I never saw nor heard of, until their names were
                  mentioned by you, who have made me the heiress to a large fortune if I consent to
                  arrangements, which I might once perhaps have been induced to consent to, but
                  which I never can consent to now. If I fail to comply with the requirements of
                  this Will, I have been told that my cousin George and you will be the gainers.
                  Why, then, do you urge this matter upon me? You have carried me away from those
                  whom as a child I learnt to love. You have denied me the poor consolation of
                  communicating with them. Only once have I been permitted to let them know that I
                  am still living. I have never seen this Will. If it be in your possession, permit
                  me to peruse it, and if it really demand such a sacrifice on my part, I am willing
                  to make it, and you and George can lawfully claim the estate. Why seek to coerce
                  me thus, when it is to your benefit, that I should disavow openly my intention of
                  fulfilling its requirements. Again, I<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7199-00000130"/>
                  say, let me read the Will and I will cancel my right to any portion of the
                  property, and gladly return to England."</p>
               <p>"And to poverty and the home of a London shopman," sneeringly replied Mr.
                  Craddock.</p>
               <p>"To poverty if necessary," replied Alice; "but this need not be. Gerald Dalton
                  possesses energy and spirit, and is not destitute of education. His lot need not
                  necessarily be one of poverty."</p>
               <p>"Very romantic indeed!" said Mr. Craddock; "but you forget that in England, a lad
                  like Gerald, of humble birth, has little opportunity of making his way in the
                  world. As to your modest request to read the Will, I plainly tell you, I shall
                  refuse it. I have the Will in my possession. Whatever be my object in forcing you
                  into the possession of fortune to my detriment, I shall not explain to you. As
                  your natural guardian, for you have no relatives but George and myself living,
                  your are wholly in my power, and that you must have known long ago. However, you
                  will think better of this contumacy. I will not hear another word now. To-morrow I
                  shall expect your reply; and the whether it involve your happiness or misery, will
                  depend upon your own good sense. For the present I wish you good-day."</p>
               <p>Alice rose, and quitting the room, retired to her own apartment, where she spent
                  the remainder of the day, until summoned to the dinner table, where she met her
                  uncle and cousin. Mr. Craddock had entirely effaced all semblance of ill-humor.
                  His conduct was as kind and courteous as ever; but as soon as the meal was
                  finished, he retired, saying with a smile, "I shall leave you two young people to
                  amuse each other this evening. I have some matters on hand which require my
                  attention."</p>
               <p>The subject of conversation between Alice and her cousin during the evening
                  naturally turned upon the stormy interviews with Mr. Craddock in the morning. The
                  young man frankly promised to support his cousin's cause, against his father, and
                  Alice resolved that whatever might be the consequence, she would not swerve from
                  her resolve.</p>
               <p>On the morrow, only a few hours before the vessel on board of which George's
                  passage to Kingston was taken, and ready to leave the port of Havana, Mr. Craddock
                  held an interview with his son and niece together. Both adhered to their expressed
                  resolution of the previous day. Mr. Craddock flew into a towering rage; but his
                  passion was of no avail in shaking the resolve of his son and niece. Alice bade
                  her cousin a kindly farewell; but the excitement of the past two days had been too
                  much for her, and she became so unwell that her maid was summoned to assist her to
                  her room; and Mr. Craddock accompanied his son to the schooner.</p>
               <p>"George," he said, after they had reached the vessel, "I leave you here. You have
                  my command to forgo any further communication with the young lady of whom you
                  spoke to me the other day. I have no doubt you will hereafter think better of what
                  I have said. You have a twelve-month before you. I am content to wait that time. I
                  then Alice changes her mind will you promise to comply with my wishes?"</p>
               <p>"If my cousin, sir, freely and of her own accord alters her resolution, and is
                  willing to accept me, as a suitor, I will; but without her free consent be
                  obtained, I will make no promise."</p>
               <p>"Be it so, obstinate boy," said Mr. Craddock, as he shook hands with his son and
                  wished him a pleasant passage. He waited on the quay till the schooner was
                  underweigh and then returned homewards.</p>
               <p>"It will go hard," he muttered to himself, as he turned away, "if I cannot before
                  a twelvemonth passes by, control that stubborn girl to my will. I have been too
                  easy with her hitherto."</p>
               <p>For several days Alice remained seriously unwell, and during this period her uncle
                  was assiduous in his attentions. All his former kindness of manner returned, and
                  he never once made allusion to the cause of their estrangement; but it was<pb
                     n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7199-00000131"/> the calm which precedes a tempest. Soon
                  after she was restored to he accustomed health, she was again subjected to
                  persecution and urged to comply with her uncle's desires, and on her repeated
                  refusals to alter her resolve, she was treated with a degree of harshness to which
                  she had been hitherto a stranger. Four months of the twelve months' probation
                  passed by and Mr. Craddock had been unable to gain a single point. He now came to
                  a desperate resolution. Alice had for three months been forbidden to leave the
                  house or to hold communication with any one but her maid Minette. Mr. Craddock now
                  engaged a passage to France for himself, his niece, and her maid without informing
                  Alice of his intentions. She knew nothing of the contemplated voyage until the day
                  before the vessel was to sail for Havre de Grace. when her uncle came to her room
                  and ordered her to prepare for a voyage to Europe.</p>
               <p>"A voyage to Europe, uncle? Where are we going?" she asked, a faint gleam of hope
                  arising in her mind that her uncle had relented and was going to return her to her
                  friends in England.</p>
               <p>"To France—to Orleans, where you were at school, some months since," was the
                  reply.</p>
               <p>"Am I to remain there?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"That you will know when you arrive in France," was the reply. "We sail to-morrow,
                  so you have little time enough to get ready."</p>
               <p>Although this sudden proposition for departure astonished Alice, any change from
                  her late monotonous life was welcome; besides even in France, she would be nearer
                  the friends she so ardently longed to see again. Minette was overjoyed at the
                  prospect of returning to her own country, and both she and her mistress set to
                  work with alacrity in making the busy preparations necessary on so short a notice.
                  At the cost of a night's rest all was in readiness on the following morning, and
                  before sunset on that day they had passed the Moro Castle, and were on their way
                  to Europe.</p>
               <p>In less than six weeks the vessel entered the port of Havre, and Mr. Craddock
                  immediately set out for Paris without allowing his niece a days' rest at Havre, to
                  recruit after the fatigues of the voyage.</p>
               <p>At paris, greatly to the regret both of Alice and Minette, the latter was
                  discharged, Mr. Craddock informing her that her young mistress would have no
                  longer occasion for her services, and two days after Alice was once more in the
                  city of Orleans. Without even stopping here at a hotel, beyond the time necessary
                  to obtain a meal and make the necessary changes of attire after the rapid journey
                  from Havre, for they had rested but a few hours in Paris, Mr. Craddock hired a
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">fiacre</foreign> and proceeded to the convent where
                  Alice had formerly been placed at school. Arrived there, he had a long and secret
                  interview with the superior, at the conclusion of which, Alice was summoned and
                  informed that she was again placed as a boarder in the convent.</p>
               <p>"I shall remain for three months in Paris, Alice," he said to his niece. "If
                  before that time expires you change your mind and are willing to conform to my
                  wishes, the Superior will let me know, and I will come immediately and take you
                  back to Havana. After that you will never quit the convent. You now know the
                  alternative that awaits you. If you are not capable of acting with a due regard
                  for your own welfare it is well that others should act for you. Farewell, and let
                  me hope that better thoughts will prevail over your perverseness and obstinacy of
                  disposition."</p>
               <p>Alice was overcome with terror. She had fainted in the arms of one of the
                  attendants and had not heard her uncle's concluding words. He hastily left the
                  room, as if fearful of trusting to his own strength of purpose, and after holding
                  another long conversation with the superior he quitted the convent and before
                  nightfall was on his way to the French capital.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>In which the hero of the story is found to have made a more successful voyage.
                     He visits old friends and receives more good advice, partially meets the usual
                     fate of good advice, and accepts the offer of a novel situation.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>GERALD'S voyage to Ceylon was a successful one. He had acquired a knowledge of
                  business in the hard school of experience, and he was acting in behalf of men who
                  were themselves experienced in their own peculiar business matters. His trip on
                  board the Firefly was in every way successful. The goods under his charge were
                  profitably disposed of at Trincomale, and according to previous arrangement he
                  left the ship there to proceed to Colombo, where his uncle Ashley and his family
                  resided. He had, as the reader is aware, more in view than the single object of
                  visiting his uncle's family. He still entertained the hope, that the stranger who
                  was believed to have abducted Alice Thornton from her home, and who had visited
                  Colombo, as it appeared, with the sole object of obtaining information of her, was
                  some relative of hers and that by this time Mr. Ashley might have heard either
                  from him or from Alice. Perhaps, he thought, as this person, according to my
                  uncle's letter, had some idea of again visiting India, he may have returned,
                  taking Alice with him. I may find her at my uncle's house. With this lively hope
                  animating him, he set about the preparations for his journey with an alacrity and
                  cheerfulness to which, since he had received the harshly written letters from
                  England, relating to his disastrous business speculations in Calcutta, he had been
                  a stranger.</p>
               <p>He had a sufficient supply of money at his command, and he determined to make the
                  journey overland, although the distance was full two hundred miles, and even then
                  he would be compelled to travel, and he would have to cross a lofty and difficult
                  mountain range; but one of his objects was to visit the famous Adam's Peak, and he
                  was not to be deterred by trifling obstacles from undertaking a journey which
                  promised to abound in incident and hardy adventure.</p>
               <p>Kollar was his first resting-place, and thence he proceeded to Kandy, the ancient
                  capital of the once independent kingdom of that name. From this city, which he
                  found little more than a heap of ruins, retaining few vestiges of its former
                  populousness and wealth, he proceeded on the direct route towards the chain of
                  mountains of which Adam's Peak is the crowning point and the centre. The journey
                  was a tedious and harassing one, but the tedium was relieved with chasing the
                  novel and noble game which was to be found by beating about, under the direction
                  of the native guides, at every one of the numerous resting places. Finally, after
                  several days' journey, through forest and jungle, and across swamps and morasses,
                  occasionally obtaining a trifling relief from the fatigue of foot travel, or the
                  scarcely less fatiguing and still more wearisome travel by ox wagon—by sailing in
                  a canoe down one or other of the numerous narrow and shallow rivers that intersect
                  the country in every direction—he reached the peak, and resting at the base for a
                  day to recover from the fatigue of the previous travel, he spent another day in
                  ascending and descending the mountain, and enjoying the splendid view from the
                  summit; and this feat accomplished, the remaining portion of the journey to
                  Colombo was much less fatiguing, the roads as they approached that capital
                  becoming gradually better and more commodious for travelling. Twenty-four hours
                  after leaving the peak, the bastions of the city were in view, and the young man
                  felt his heart leap with joy at the prospect of again seeing the friends from whom
                  he had been so long separated.</p>
               <pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7199-00000133"/>
               <p>His uncle had received no intimation of the visit, nor did he know in what
                  direction from the city the Mission school, of which he had the charge, was
                  situated. However, this was a matter of small moment, as he had no doubt he could
                  readily find Mr. Ashley by making inquiry when he entered the city. He was even
                  saved this trouble, for on reaching the <foreign>pettah,</foreign> or inner town,
                  almost the first thing that attracted his attention was a crowd of Europeans
                  coming out of a building, which he was informed was the public library, that day
                  opened for the first time. It struck him that it was not improbable that his uncle
                  might be amongst this crowd, and he advanced towards it. He was correct in his
                  judgment. Mr. Ashley, looking somewhat yellow in complexion, but otherwise little
                  changed since Gerald had parted with him London, more than three years before, was
                  coming down the steps of the building just as he reached it, and behind him was a
                  youth whom Gerald had no difficulty in recognizing as his cousin Henry. He
                  advanced towards them, and taking his uncle by the hand, asked him after his
                  health.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, sir I'm pretty well," replied Mr. Ashley, "but you have the advantage
                  of me. I really cannot recall your name, though, it strikes me that I have seen
                  your features somewhere before."</p>
               <p>"Why, it's Cousin Gerald Dalton, father," said Henry Ashley, advancing and shaking
                  the young man heartily by the hand.</p>
               <p>"Gerald! what, Gerald Dalton!" exclaimed Mr. Ashley. "Dear me—Gerald Dalton. Why,
                  who would have thought of seeing you here? Welcome, welcome, my boy. I never
                  should have known you. Bless me! how you have grown, and so changed too, so stout
                  and brown, and in a sailor's dress. We see so many sailors here, that I took you
                  for the mate of one of the ships in port."</p>
               <p>"I knew Gerald, the moment I saw him," said Henry.</p>
               <p>"Well, never mind," continued Mr. Ashley, "we are going home to dine. My bungalow
                  is a mile or so beyond the suburbs of the city. You must come with us, and
                  enlighten us as we walk as to how you came to drop down so unexpectedly in our
                  midst. How surprised and delighted your aunt will be to see you."</p>
               <p>"Are my aunt and cousins all well?" said Gerald.</p>
               <p>"All quite well. The climate really agrees with us famously. You know your aunt
                  was very subject to nervous attacks at home, in England. She has quite got over
                  them now. Never has had a day's sickness since she has been here and, by the bye,
                  you will have two new cousins whom you have not yet seen—twins, and as pretty a
                  pair of little girls as ever were seen."</p>
               <p>"You spoke of them, sir, in your letter respecting the stranger who visited you to
                  make inquires respecting Alice Thornton."</p>
               <p>"Ay, I dare say I did; but I had forgotten. They were born, I recollect now,
                  sometime before I wrote that letter; but you remind me of Alice, poor, dear child!
                  I hope you have received some intelligence of her or from her before this?"</p>
               <p>"None, sir," replied Gerald, "not a word. I was in hopes that you might have heard
                  of her."</p>
               <p>"No, Gerald, no. I have heard nothing. poor child! I ought not to have left her in
                  England. I should have brought her to Ceylon with me. I feel that I have
                  grievously failed in the fulfilment of my promise given to her father on his
                  deathbed; but I acted for the best."</p>
               <p>They walked on for some time in silence, Mr. Ashley thinking of the probable fate
                  of Alice, and Gerald keenly disappointed in his hope of at least hearing something
                  of her from his uncle, though that hope had rested on a fragile foundation.</p>
               <p>Henry Ashley was the first to break the silence and interrupt the painful current
                  of thought.</p>
               <p>"You have not yet told us, Gerald, how you came to find us out in this out-of-the
                  way part of the world," he said. Thus<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7199-00000134"/>
                  reminded of his mission, Gerald briefly recapitulated his adventures since leaving
                  home, omitting, however, for the present, the unfortunate, though somewhat
                  ludicrous result of his first adventure in Calcutta. "But where is Frederick? you
                  have said nothing about my cousin Frederick," he said, when he had concluded his
                  story.</p>
               <p>"Do you see that cruizer lying out there in the harbor, with the pendant flying at
                  the main-royal mast head?" said Henry pointing in the direction of the vessel.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Gerald.</p>
               <p>"Frederick is on board of her. She is a new frigate belonging to the East India
                  Company, and Fred. has just got an appointment as Assistant Surgeon in the
                  service. He has already been one cruize on board the Goa brig and has lately been
                  removed to the frigate. We expect him at home to-night. But have you embraced the
                  profession of a sailor? One would think so to look at your rig."</p>
               <p>"Not exactly so," replied Gerald, "though for anything I know, at present, I may
                  do so; but I will relate my adventures more fully when we get home and I have had
                  something to eat, for I am really quite hungry as well as tired, after my journey.
                  It is no trifle to undertake to travel overland from Trincomale."</p>
               <p>"Not when you are unused to travelling in the jungle, and through the forest,"
                  replied Henry; "but we don't think much of the trip here; however, here we are
                  nearly home. You see that pile of buildings, there, to the left, just beyond that
                  grove of cinnamon trees: that's the mission school, and the house beyond, standing
                  amidst the plantation is our bungalow, and a very pretty place you'll say it is
                  when you get there and have rested yourself and had time to look about you."</p>
               <p>"You intend to remain with us for some time, Gerald, of course?" said Mr Ashley.
                  "A visitor from so great a distance must not pay a mere passing visit."</p>
               <p>"That will depend upon circumstances," replied Gerald. "I have no immediate
                  engagement, nor have I determined exactly what to do. I wish to visit the United
                  States; but I shall in the first place return to Calcutta."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, if your time is your own," said Mr. Ashley "you can surely spare us a
                  portion of it, after so long a separation; but here we are close home; the
                  cinnamon grove conceals the school-house now, but you can hear the hum of the
                  children's voices, and here, I declare, is your aunt and little Emma with her,
                  coming to meet us. They have seen us from the house, and have been wondering, no
                  doubt, who the stranger is accompanying us. How surprised your aunt will be when
                  she finds out who it is."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Ashley had now approached close to the party.</p>
               <p>"I have brought a stranger from England, to share our hospitality, my dear," said
                  Mr. Ashley, presenting Gerald to his wife.</p>
               <p>"I am glad to see you, sir," said Mrs. Ashley, extending her hand to the young
                  man. "Any person from England is welcome and doubly so when he brings intelligence
                  of the friends we have left behind us. Are you from our part of the country—from
                  Kent, sir? Why, bless me! it can't be possible. Yes, it is Gerald Dalton. Why,
                  Gerald, my dear, who would have thought of seeing you out here?" and the
                  affectionate little woman embraced him as ardently as if he had been one of her
                  own children restored to her after a long absence.</p>
               <p>Eager inquiries were again made after absent friends, although Gerald could
                  furnish little information on that score since he had been very little in
                  Herrington since Mr. Ashley had left, and again the mysterious disappearance of
                  Alice Thornton was the subject of regretful comment.</p>
               <p>However, dinner was served and waiting the return of Mr. Ashley and his son from
                  the city, and soon all were seated at the meal, to which Gerald did ample
                  justice.</p>
               <p>"You will take up your abode with us, of course," said<pb n="268-269"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000135"/> Mrs. Ashley while dinner was progressing. "Where
                  have you left your luggage?"</p>
               <p>"At the hotel at the entrance of the inner town," replied Gerald. "of course I
                  intended to put up here, if you had room for me, and I left orders to have it sent
                  to your residence. You see that I was determined that you should be my hosts for
                  one night whether you had accommodations or not," he laughingly added.</p>
               <p>"Quite right. Where else should you put up while we have a roof to shelter you,"
                  answered Mrs. Ashley. "Mr. Ashley is going to send the bullock cart to the city to
                  bring home some marketing this afternoon, and the driver can call at the hotel for
                  your effects. If you trust to their being sent on, you may wait a week."</p>
               <p>"At the end of which period, I expect to be on my way back to Calcutta," said
                  Gerald.</p>
               <p>"Nonsense. Who would ever think of paying so short a visit as that. You must stop
                  with us a month at least," said Mr. Ashley. "Besides there is no ship now in port
                  bound to Calcutta. Frederick will be up here in the course of an hour or so and he
                  will be rejoiced to see his old playmate."</p>
               <p>"That he will, indeed," observed Mrs. Ashley. "How well he looks in his uniform,"
                  she added, with a mother's pride.</p>
               <p>"You'll stay with us a month, won't you, Gerald?" said Henry.</p>
               <p>"Since as it seems you are determined to insist upon it," said Gerald, "and as I
                  may perhaps have letters sent on here from Calcutta in the course of that time, I
                  suppose I must consent."</p>
               <p>"Well, then that matter is arranger," said Mrs Ashley, "so we'll say no more on
                  the subject. Now, if you like, I will show you to a room, which you can
                  appropriate to yourself. Probably you may wish to rest awhile, and we will call
                  you when Frederick comes."</p>
               <p>Gerald readily assented to this arrangement, and having been shown to an apartment
                  and provided with a change of linen clothing, till his luggage should arrive, he
                  threw himself upon the cool, cane lounge, and soon fell asleep. Towards sunset he
                  was awakened by his cousin Henry who ran into the room to tell him that Frederick
                  had come and was extremely anxious to see him. He quickly roused himself and
                  making a rapid toilet, joined his uncle and cousins in the verandah. Frederick had
                  grown so tall and looked so different to the boy he had known him, in his naval
                  uniform, that Gerald confessed he would not have recognized him so readily as he
                  had his brother Henry, and he almost envied him his good fortune when he saw him
                  looking so manly and handsome. Mrs. Ashley soon joined the party and the evening
                  was spent in talking of home and old friends, and in listening to a more detailed
                  account of Gerald's adventures, and in speculation as to the fate of Alice, to
                  whom all the family had been greatly attached.</p>
               <p>The Mysore, the new frigate to which Frederick was attached, was going to remain
                  in port for four or five weeks, when she was bound to Bombay, and as there was a
                  greater probability to Gerald's finding a vessel bound to Calcutta at Bombay than
                  at Colombo, where he might wait for months, the young surgeon pressed his cousin
                  to remain until the frigate sailed, and take passage with him.</p>
               <p>"I would have no objection to go to Bombay," replied Gerald, "provided, in the
                  meantime, no vessel sails for Calcutta; but the Company's cruizers do not carry
                  passengers, and I cannot get any appointment on board a vessel of that
                  description."</p>
               <p>"I think I can manage that," replied Mr. Ashley. "The captain of the frigate is a
                  friend of mine, and at my request, will, I have no doubt, gladly give you a
                  passage."</p>
               <p>"And you can mess in the ward room, with the officers," said Frederick. "You will
                  find them a capital set of fellows,"</p>
               <p>"If you think it can be managed, I am agreeable," said Gerald, "and shall be
                  greatly obliged to you, for I should like to visit<pb n="270-271"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000136"/> Bombay. It seems," he added, "that may every wish
                  is to be anticipated."</p>
               <p>"We don't often have visits from our relatives in England," said Mrs. Ashley. "We
                  must make the most of them when they do come."</p>
               <p>The next morning Gerald was shown around the Mission, and he afterwards
                  accompanied Mr. Ashley and his cousin Frederick on board the Mysore, where he was
                  introduced to the commander and an offer of a passage to Bombay freely tendered.
                  The crew were all in good health, and as Frederick in consequence had very light
                  duties to perform, the commander at the further request of Mr. Ashley, readily
                  gave him leave of absence for a fortnight on account of the arrival of his
                  relative from England, and it was arranged that a series of athletic amusements,
                  peculiar to the island should be gotten up for Gerald's entertainment. Elk and
                  wild boar hunts were devised and if practicable it was resolved that Gerald should
                  witness an elephant hunt before he left.</p>
               <p>All these arrangements were successfully carried out, and the time passed away
                  agreeably, the evenings, when it was not necessary for the enthusiastic huntsmen
                  to encamp out all night, being spent in conversation at home, where Gerald
                  succeeded in making himself an established favorite with his younger cousins, the
                  duplicate twins.</p>
               <p>When narrating his adventures since leaving Herrington, the young man had
                  refrained from making any allusion to the letters he had received from Mr.
                  Hoffmann and his mother and the vicar in reply to his account of the sale of the
                  goods. But one day while walking out with his uncle, neither of his cousins being
                  present, he spoke of those letters and stated his intention not to return home
                  until of their own accord his friends had expressed regret for their conduct and
                  for the expressions they had made use of when writing to him.</p>
               <p>"You are acting wrongfully, Gerald," said Mr. Ashley, when he had listened to his
                  nephew's explanation and exculpation tion of his own conduct. "I have no doubt
                  that you feel keenly the misinterpretation that has been put upon your action in
                  this matter. I truly believe that you did the best you could for your employers;
                  and you know that we all have laughed over the description of the collection of
                  oddities that your friends sent out to India for sale. It is only a wonder to me
                  that you disposed of many of the goods in any way whatever; but by remaining
                  abroad you give Mr. Hoffmann and his friends reason to believe that they are
                  justified in condemning you. You can procure a letter from the consignee of the
                  Seringapatam, who, you say, told you that the goods were unsaleable, which will go
                  along way towards exculpating you, and you can show that letter yourself to Mr.
                  Hoffmann, and convince him that he has done you injustice. If he is a reasonable
                  man, he will readily confess that he has wronged you. I do not attempt to palliate
                  his conduct in misrepresenting you to your mother and your friends at Herrington;
                  but you are yourself committing a grievous wrong, a wrong that you will one day
                  deeply regret having committed, in allowing your indignation to fall upon the
                  vicar and upon your mother. They have been misled, and as you say their letters
                  were written in sorrow not in anger, you are obstinately maintaining a false
                  position by your present conduct, when a proper course of action would soon
                  reinstate you in the good opinion of all. Be guided by me an act as I have advised
                  you. How long is it since you have written to your mother?"</p>
               <p>"After I returned from the islands, I then wrote in reply to letters I found
                  awaiting me in Calcutta, sir," replied Gerald.</p>
               <p>"Then write to her again from this place; tell her that you are sorry for the
                  harsh expressions you permitted to escape from your pen in the moment of
                  indignation, and promise to return home as soon as convenient. Remember, Gerald,
                  she has no one but you to care for in this world, since poor Alice<pb n="272-273"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000137"/> has been from her, and Alice could never have been
                  to her what you are and ever must be while she lives. Beg her to forgive your
                  petulance and passion, and I promise you, you will feel happier when you have done
                  this; and when you return to Calcutta, obtain a justification of your conduct from
                  responsible persons there, and write to Mr. Hoffmann. You need not humble yourself
                  in doing this but if he be a man of correct feeling your letter will humble him,
                  and when he sees you again he will readily acknowledge his injustice and be more
                  desirous of serving you than before you left England."</p>
               <p>"I will follow your advice in regard to my mother, uncle," said Gerald, who had
                  been much affected with the first portion of his uncle's remarks, "but," and his
                  voice changed its tremulous tone, to one of deep and scornful indignation, "to Mr.
                  Hoffmann I will not write again until he shall first freely acknowledge the grow
                  wrong he has done me. I could sooner pardon his abusive letter to me than his base
                  conduct in endeavoring to represent my conduct in a false light to my mother and
                  to Mr. Pearce."</p>
               <p>"He did not know he was doing so in the heat of his anger at having suffered such
                  a loss, Gerald," mildly replied Mr. Ashley.</p>
               <p>"<emph>He</emph> suffer loss, in the trash! the unsaleable rubbish he placed in my
                  charge!" cried Gerald, "he was more than paid by his share of the paltry
                  remittance I sent home."</p>
               <p>"But others did through him, if he did not, Gerald," said Mr. Ashley, "and he
                  himself no doubt fancied that he had also suffered with them."</p>
               <p>"Then let him of his own accord discover that he was wrong," said the young man.
                  "I have resolved never to write to him again until he writes to beg
                     <emph>my</emph> pardon for the wrong he has done me."</p>
               <p>"You will regret this obstinacy and pride, Gerald."</p>
               <p>"I cannot help it, uncle. I will not humble myself to that man nor to his
                  associates. I will write to-morrow to my mother ther and dispatch the letter by
                  the next mail that leaves this place for England. I acknowledge that I have acted
                  hastily and unkindly in condemning her and I am sorry that I sent it; but write to
                  Mr. Hoffmann! <emph>never!</emph>"</p>
               <p>Mr. Ashley forbore to press the subject further, and on the following day Gerald
                  wrote to his mother a long letter, full of expressions of affection and kindness,
                  and though he did not promise to return home immediately, he said that he would
                  write by every opportunity. He begged her to forgive any unkind expression she
                  might have discovered in his last letter, for he had scarcely knew what he had
                  written, his mind at the time of writing had been so agitated, and he enclosed in
                  the letter a draft for¥20, out of the profits of his late successful voyage from
                  Calcutta to Ceylon, as a proof that he was doing well, and of his desire that she
                  should share his good fortune.</p>
               <p>This duty done, he acknowledged to his uncle that he felt his mind relieved of
                  half its burden</p>
               <p>The day was now nearly at hand on which the Mysore was to sail for Bombay, and
                  yet, although one mail had arrived from Bengal, he had received no letters from
                  the consignee, whom he had directed to send to Colombo any letters that he might
                  receive from England, directed to Gerald Dalton. But on the morning on which the
                  frigate got underweigh, a second mail arrived, bringing the letter from Mrs.
                  Dalton, containing information of the brief letter she had received from Alice and
                  also informing her son that she had heard from Mr. Brower. This letter as the
                  reader is already aware should have reached Gerald sooner, but various causes had
                  united to delay its earlier arrival at its destination.</p>
               <p>This letter Gerald did not receive until the frigate had left the port of Colombo,
                  the mail having been brought on board by the pilot, consequently Mr. Ashley was
                  ignorant of its tenor.</p>
               <p>It had, however, the opposite effect to that which the widow had hoped for. "I
                  would go to the United States and see this<pb n="274-275"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000138"/> Mr. Brower at the earliest opportunity," he said,
                  after having read the letter to his cousin, "but I have an idea that this man
                  whoever he be, who has obtained this strange control over Alice intends to bring
                  her out to India. He expressed some intention of returning here, to your father,
                  you recollect. I shall therefore remain here longer than I anticipated. I will
                  find Alice if possible, and if my endeavors are fruitless, I will then visit the
                  United States, and return thence to England, and mother and I will go back to
                  America and settle there."</p>
               <p>The young surgeon was of the same opinion as his cousin, respecting Alice,
                  although he said Gerald's chance of discovering her was a very feeble one. There
                  was, he said, no satisfactory proof that the person who had assumed the strange
                  guardianship over her would return to India. Still the remark he had made to Mr.
                  Ashley led to that inference.</p>
               <p>Gerald, on the arrival of the mysore at Bombay, wrote to his mother again,
                  informing her of his resolution, and giving her his reasons for having formed
                  it.</p>
               <p>The Captain's clerk of the Mysore had died on the passage from Colombo to Bombay,
                  and on the arrival of the frigate at the latter port, the Captain offered the
                  situation to Gerald. The offer was readily accepted, and thus the young man found
                  himself duly enrolled as one of the crew of the Company's cruizer.</p>

            <div type="chapter">

               <argument>
                  <p>Showing how the noble Dane was right when he said, "There are more things in
                     Heaven and Earth, Horatio, that e'er were dreamed of in our philosophy."</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AFTER lying a few weeks in the port of Bombay, and having been on a short cruise
                  up the Persian Gulf, the captain of the Mysore received orders to sail for the
                  Yellow Sea. This order was received with joy by all on board, for officers and
                  crew were alike tired of lying in a port possessing so few fascinations as Bombay.
                  Gerald was delighted at the prospect of a change of scene although his present
                  post afforded him little opportunity of hearing of Alice or her self-constituted
                  guardian, even if e should have returned to India, and have brought her with him.
                  Another matter occasioned the young man no little annoyance. He knew not how he
                  should get possession of the letter which he expected to arrive in the course of a
                  few months from his mother in reply to that which he had written her from Colombo.
                  He had requested it to be directed to him, in the care of his uncle Ashley,
                  anticipating the return of the frigate to Ceylon, and this voyage of indefinite
                  duration to the coat of China rendered the receipt of letters from any part of the
                  world very uncertain. His only resource was to wait with patience until the cruise
                  should expire, when the Mysore would either return to Colombo, or sail for some
                  port from which he could communicate with Mr. Ashley and request his letters to be
                  forwarded to him.</p>
               <p>In due time the frigate reached her cruising ground and there sailing and
                  countersailing, backwards and forwards along the Chinese coast, sometimes
                  stretching off to the Phillipine<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7199-00000139"/> Loo
                  Choo Islands, occasionally going into some minor port on the coast, the Mysore
                  remained on the station for two months: that short period appearing to have
                  lengthened itself into two years, so speedily did the crew tire of their new
                  cruising ground and long to return to some more hospitable station; such strange
                  beings are sailors and so prone to tire of that which but a short time before they
                  looked forward to with delight.</p>
               <p>It was therefore with no little gratification that in falling in with the
                  commodore's ship of the squadron, off Canton, they heard orders given to sail for
                  Singapore and there await fresh orders from Bombay.</p>
               <p>Communication could be readily had t Singapore with Bombay, Calcutta, or any other
                  part of the East Indies, still from the nature of the orders he had received, the
                  captain of the frigate had every reason to expect a long detention in the harbor
                  of that beautiful and thriving dependency.</p>
               <p>The island was reached within a fortnight after the vessel's prow had been turned
                  westward. The officers freely visited the shore and partook of the hospitalities
                  of the merchants on the island, and the crew were allowed shore-leave at stated
                  intervals, those remaining on board being employed in refitting and tarring the
                  rigging and painting the ship, which had suffered severely from the tempestuous
                  weather so often encountered in the Yellow Sea.</p>
               <p>The business alacrity everywhere visible on shore, the many attractive rides and
                  drives over the island, the frequency of the entertainments given by the merchants
                  and dignitaries, and the lively scene in the harbor, where lay vessels of evey
                  European commercial nation, and Chinese junks in almost countless numbers; the
                  abundance and cheapness of fresh fruits and vegetables, and the delightful climate
                  of this little tropical paradise, rendered the change from the solitary cruise
                  from which they had lately returned doubly grateful, and every one on board
                  participated in the general feeling of gladness.</p>
               <p>Gerald immediately upon the ship's arrival had written his uncle, at Colombo, and
                  to Mr. Thompson, at Calcutta, requesting that any letters that might be awaiting
                  him should be forwarded to him at Singapore, and this task accomplished, he
                  entered freely into the pleasures of the hour, and endeavored to nerve himself
                  with patience to await the long time that must yet elapse before he could hear
                  from his friends.</p>
               <p>In spite of all his endeavors a singular presentiment of some coming evil haunted
                  him to such a degree that he could not shake it off. His situation as captain's
                  clerk relieved him from the duty of keeping the customary anchor-watch while in
                  port, but he generally remained up during the first watch, conversing with the
                  officer in charge of the deck, for it he retired early to rest, the strange
                  foreboding of approaching evil which occupied his mind, led to frightful dreams
                  which surrounded his walking hours, when not actively employed. He spoked to his
                  cousin on the subject but Frederick merely endeavored to laugh him out of his
                  gloomy conceits.</p>
               <p>"Pooh, pooh! my dear fellow," he would say, "you are suffering under a slight
                  attack of hypochondria. You should take more exercise. Your occupation of quill
                  driving is too sedentary. You must not permit your mind to brood over silly
                  fancies. You are too anxious about those letters you are expecting. I have not
                  heard from home since we left Colombo. and yet I do not worry myself about things
                  I cannot help. In the course of a few days we shall hear from Ceylon and Calcutta
                  too, and then I warrant you'll find everything right."</p>
               <p>"I trust so," Gerald would reply.</p>
               <p>"Then think so. It's never any use foreboding evil. It's bad enough when it comes;
                  but all the lighter for coming without being anticipated. The anticipation is
                  generally worse than the reality." And so Gerald endeavored to school himself to
                  think, but still all his efforts were fruitless, and he grew more desponding every
                  day, as the time drew near when a reply might to expected to the letter he had
                  despatched to his Uncle Ashley.</p>
               <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7199-00000140"/>
               <p>One day the officers of the Mysore gave a party on board to the merchants and
                  their ladies. Everything had passed off pleasantly, and Gerald who had joined in
                  the dance several times during the evening, felt his spirits much revived. It was
                  near midnight when the guests left the frigate, and after they had gone Gerald
                  walked the deck for some time, smoking a cigar and talking with his cousin.</p>
               <p>"I think you were right, Fred," he said, "when you told me, the other day, that I
                  did not take sufficient exercise. I feel better to-night than I have done for a
                  long time, not that my bodily health is improved, for it is always good; but I
                  have taken a great deal of violent exercise to-night, and I feel much more
                  cheerful than I have done since we entered this port."</p>
               <p>"Of course you do," returned Frederick. "You wanted exercise, nothing more. You
                  were beginning to feel a little home-sick. I have felt so myself at times; but
                  now, take my advice, and don't overdo the thing. Go below and turn in at once, and
                  to-morrow you'll find yourself quite another being."</p>
               <p>The young men descended to the wardroom together, and Frederick retired to his
                  hammock; but Gerald, not feeling sleepy, seated himself on a stool, opened his
                  chest, and taking out a book, commenced reading. The book he had chosen out of the
                  few that the chest contained, was a volume of the Pilgrim's Progress, which had
                  been given him by his mother a day or two before he had left Abbottsford for
                  London. It was among the latest souvenirs from her that he possessed.</p>
               <p>On the fly leaf his name was written in her hand-writing, and beneath was a
                  quotation from Cowper—her favorite poet.</p>
               <p>Gerald's eye on opening the volume chanced to fall upon this verse: <q>

               <p>Gerald, at Mrs. Dalton's request, had read this entire poem of Cowper's, "On the
                  Receipt of his Mother's Picture," during the afternoon of the day on which she had
                  presented him with this little memento, and when placing the book in his hands
                  before he retired to rest, she said:</p>
               <p>"Gerald, in a few days you will be on the ocean, bound to a distant country. I
                  sincerely hope we shall meet again, my son; but, perhaps, it may not be. If not—if
                  before you return to England I shall have passed into the tomb, and if the
                  disembodied spirit be permitted to watch over the welfare of those whom they have
                  loved on earth, my spirit will be ever hovering around you, Gerald, until yours
                  rejoins mine in a better world. It is a gloomy fancy that has possessed me this
                  evening, Gerald; lowness of spirits, occasioned by your approaching departure and
                  my own poor health, I suspect has been the cause of it, and I will try to overcome
                  it: but, Gerald, I have written a stanza from the poem you read aloud to-day in
                  the fly leaf of this book, and should I be removed hence before we meet again,
                  when your eyes read those lines, cease to grieve for me, but rather believe that I
                  am happier in heaven than I have been here, and am only waiting, to complete my
                  happiness, for you to rejoin me."</p>
               <pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7199-00000141"/>
               <p>"You must not give way to these melancholy feelings, mother," answered Gerald. "I
                  shall not be very long absent; the probability is, that I shall see you again,
                  sooner than of I were going to remain in London. You are much improved in health
                  since you have resided at Abbottsford, and when I return to England, I hope to
                  find your health completly restored."</p>
               <p>Gerald had never opened this book from the day he left England until now, and as
                  he read the lines and recalled the conversation to which they hd given rise, his
                  heart smote him for the disregard he had paid to his mother's entreaties to return
                  to England as soon as possible. He thought of the unkind letter he had written
                  from Calcutta, and again he seemed to hear his Uncle Ashley's warning voice
                  saying, "Gerald, you will one day deeply sorrow for having allowed your
                  indignation to fall upon your mother."</p>
               <p>Instead of reading the volume, a strange fascination, that he could not withstand,
                  fixed his gaze upon these lines, traced by his mother's hand.</p>
               <p>How long he sat in this position, he declared, subsequently, that he did not know:
                  hours must have passed, although they seemed but minutes. He was still gazing upon
                  the page, when the lines grew indistinct, as if some shadow had passed over them.
                  The fascination that had fixed his gaze was gone, and raising his head, he
                  endeavored to discover the cause of the shadow which had suddenly obscured the
                  page. Before him was a thin yet palpable mist, in the midst of which he fancied he
                  could discern the shadowy outline of a human form. He was again fascinated, and
                  was unable to withdraw his gaze; the mist slowly dissolved, and the figure grew
                  more distinct. Soon he could plainly distinguish the form of his mother, clad in a
                  plain white robe, that might have been a shroud, and then the features became
                  visible, at first shadowy and indistinct, then more and more clearly defined,
                  until the mist had entirely disappeared, and his mother's figure stood erect
                  before him, one hand pointing upwards, the other with the fore finger outstretched
                  stretched, pointing to the open page of the volume upon his knee. The features
                  were those of his mother as he had last seen her, but the face was pale and
                  death-like, and the expression of the countenance was a sad and sorrowful, yet
                  beaming with love and pity. Soon as he gazed, essaying to speak, yet unable to
                  give utterance to a word—the expression of the countenance changed to one of
                  thankfulness and gratitude—a sweet, gentle smile, lighted up the pale face, and he
                  heard his mother's well-remembered voice, saying, as her finger still pointed to
                  the page—"Remember, Gerald, remember!" and in a moment the figure vanished from
                  his sight.</p>
               <p>He started like one awaking from a frightful dream. It was not long past midnight,
                  when he had seated himself in the cabin, but the faint glimmer of day was beaming
                  in through the skylight, and the solitary lamp, by the light of which he had
                  intended to read, was flickering feebly in the socket. His brow was bathed in a
                  cold, clammy sweat, and his frame shuddered with cold. He could hear the deep
                  breathing of the other occupants of the wardroom,—all were yet sleeping soundly.
                  At first, he thought he had been sleeping and dreaming himself, but still he sat
                  upright, with the chest-lid open before him, and the open volume lying upon his
                  knee, in exactly the same position in which he had placed it hours before. Had he
                  stirred a single inch, it must have fallen to the floor; besides, the impression
                  left of his mother's figure and features, and the sound of her warning voice, and
                  the gentle smile which had succeeded the first mournful gaze was all too vivid to
                  have been effected by a dream. For some moments he still felt the spell upon him;
                  then he rose, placed the book in the chest, closed the lid, extinguished the last
                  faint glimmer of the flickering lamp, and threw himself, dressed as he was, into
                  his hammock. A strange sense of weariness oppressed him, and he was soon asleep.
                  Then he dreamed indeed. He was home again, in Abbottsford; he had alighted from
                  the stage; at the corner of the lane, which led to the village<pb n="282-283"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000142"/> lage from the high road, and with a joyous heart
                  trudged gaily on, intending to give his mother a happy surprise, for she knew not
                  of his coming. And now the village was in sight; he could see the turret of the
                  little village church peeping over the horse-chestnut trees, which surrounded and
                  shaded the sacred structure. The birds were chirping sweetly amidst the budding
                  foliage of the trees and hedges, for it was the season of early spring, when
                  nature puts forth her gayest garments. Suddenly the deep toll of the church-bell
                  struck solemnly upon his ear; his gaiety and joyousness had fled. He hurried on,
                  until he met with a villager—one whose features he seemed to recollect and yet
                  whose name he could not recall. With the strange inconsistency of a dream the
                  figure and features seemed to be those of Mr. Pearce—then of Jemmy Milton—then of
                  his uncle Ashley. Again the bell tolled mournfully, and approaching the village,
                  he asked the cause of this death-peal.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Dalton died last night," replied the person addressed.</p>
               <p>A faint sickness came over the young man, and he felt as if he would have fallen
                  to the earth; but recovering himself, he turned to ask further questions—the
                  stranger had vanished.</p>
               <p>Again the scene changed; he was still at Abbottsford, but the beautiful spring
                  morning had passed away, and the wind blew keen and chill, whistling dolefully
                  through the young leaves on the tress, a fitting accompaniment to the mournful
                  sound of the church bell which was still tolling. The sky above was gloomy and
                  lowering, and people passed by him hurriedly. their eyes cast sadly upon the
                  ground. All were hastening in one direction, and in that direction he turned his
                  steps. It led him into the church-yard, and just as he entered the gate, a
                  mournful procession was leaving the church. A coffin covered with a pall, and
                  preceded by a clergyman in his black gown, was carried between four bearers, the
                  pall supported by school children. Two and two together, several adults, male and
                  female, clad in sombre garments, followed immediately behind; and then, also, two
                  and two together, followed the children the neighboring parish school, clad in
                  white garments, with black sashes round their waists. Some were weeping; all wore
                  a look of sadness as they slowly passed on towards an open grave at some short
                  distance from the church, and situated deep in the shadow of the chestnut grove.
                  The clergyman halted at the head of the grave, and read the burial service, and
                  anon the voices of the children who stood around burst forth in a mournful chant.
                  Then the coffin was lowered into the grave. He heard the hollow rattle of the
                  earth as it was east upon the coffin by the grave-digger, and the solemn tone of
                  the clergyman's voice as he repeated the words:— <q>
                     <l>"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust."</l>
                  </q> He had stood spell bound during the ceremony; when all was over, he found
                  words to speak, and turned to ask a question of some one of the mourners, but all
                  had vanished except the sexton. He stood alone with him.</p>
               <p>"Whose funeral is this?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"Where have you come from that you do not know?" was the reply. "'Tis Mrs.
                  Dalton's the village schoolmistress's. Ah! poor thing, she was a good body, and
                  sorely she sorrowed that her son was not by her to close her dying eyes."</p>
               <p>"I am Gerald Dalton!" he replied, and the man seized him firmly by the shoulder.
                  He struggled to extricate himself, and awoke to find Frederick Ashley standing by
                  the side of his hammock, shaking him roughly.</p>
               <p>"Are you going to lie in your hammock all day long?" he cried. "It's nearly seven
                  bells. Breakfast will be ready directly, and hammocks have been piped up long ago.
                  Come, rouse up. We have arranged a party to go and see a tiger hunt; the brutes
                  have swam over from the main land, and have been playing the d—l with the Chinese
                  laborers on the plantations; the merchants have collected a lot of coolies, and
                  are going to turn out <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en masse</foreign> for the hunt.
                  Come, make haste, or you will be too late."</p>
               <pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7199-00000143"/>
               <p>Gerald sprang from his hammock, performed his ablutions, changed his clothes, and
                  sat down to the breakfast-table, but he was unable to eat a mouthful.</p>
               <p>"Why, Gerald, what ails you this morning?" asked Frederick. "You look as pale as
                  the ghost in Hamlet, and only last night you were boasting of being so well."</p>
               <p>"I am not sick," replied Gerald, "but I have no appetite this morning, and don't
                  care for any breakfast."</p>
               <p>"The very way to get sick in this climate, not to eat in the morning," said
                  Frederick, helping himself to another roll. "But you'll soon have an appetite if
                  you join the hunt to-day. We are going to take provisions with us."</p>
               <p>"I must beg to be excused from joining you," said Gerald.</p>
               <p>"Pooh! What nonsense. You've got into your old tantrums upon your joining us for
                  the benefit of your health. We go to-day up to Mr. Morley's plantations, and wait
                  there till night-fall, when the tigers come out of the jungle, and then we shall
                  set out in chase. We shall have a grand and exciting time of it."</p>
               <p>Again Gerald begged to be excused, and his cousin, noticing his agitation, forbore
                  to press his further; but after breakfast, when the party had gone on deck, he
                  stepped up to him and kindly inquired what ailed him. Gerald for some time refused
                  to explain, but at length he yielded to his cousin's pressing questions, and
                  relating the singular waking vision of the previous night, and the subsequent
                  equally singular dreams.</p>
               <p>"Nonsense, my dear fellow," said Frederick, "waking visions, indeed! that was a
                  dream as well as the others. You are allowing yourself to become the victim of a
                  morbid imagination, Gerald, and you must shake off these fancies, or you will
                  become a confirmed hypochondriac."</p>
               <p>"It could not have been a dream," said Gerald, "the impression it left left was
                  too vivid, it was not like those other dreams which followed; besides I could not
                  have slept for hours with an open volume lying on my knee and myself sitting
                  upright, without any support, on a camp-stool. The thing's impossible."</p>
               <p>"Not at all impossible," said Frederick, "we can sleep in strange attitudes
                  sometimes. Why, I've slept on horseback while out hunting in Ceylon, before now,
                  and held the reins and guided the horse as cleverly as if I had been broad
                  awake."</p>
               <p>"What is the day of the month?" asked Gerald.</p>
               <p>"The 18th of April," replied Frederick.</p>
               <p>"And at what hour does the daylight begin to appear in the morning?"</p>
               <p>"About six o'clock."</p>
               <p>"I shall note the day of the month down," said Gerald. "I am certain that I saw
                  something more than a mere dream last night."</p>
               <p>"Well, I see you won't be convinced, and an obstinate man—and you are a deuced
                  obstinate chap, you know, Gerald—must have his own way, as the old adage says.
                  After all, Hamlet was right when he said "There is more in Heaven and Earth,
                  Horatio, than e'er ws dreamed of in our philosophy," but you are fretting now
                  about letters from England when you know it is only about four months since you
                  wrote to your mother from Colombo, and she can scarcely have done more than
                  received the letter yet, certainly there has not been time for you to receive a
                  reply to it."</p>
               <p>"No, but still I cannot help this strange foreboding that has come cross my
                  mind."</p>
               <p>"And which is the cause of nightmares and frightful dreams, and indigestion, and
                  loss of appetite, and evils of all sorts. Come," he added, after a pause,
                  observing Gerald's irresolution, "you must join us to-day. The exercise and
                  excitement will shake off these gloomy fancies," and Gerald at length suffered
                  himself to be persuaded, and promised to join the party.</p>

                  that insignificant little seaport been swallowed up by the ever-encroaching sea,
                  and forever blotted out from the world; the map of Europe would have needed no
                  modification, and even the map of the small island of Great Britain would have
                  required little perceptible alteration, and yet, during the brief period in the
                  course of this narrative that has been occupied in the description of events that
                  occurred in distant localities, a circumstance had occurred in Herrington which
                  had very much excited the little community and had been food for the gossips and a
                  matter of grave speculation to the sages and of the town. Deacon Milton, its
                  wealthiest, and one of its oldest inhabitants, had died, full of years and
                     <emph>honors,</emph> "deeply lamented by all the residents of the borough of
                  which he had so long been a prominent and influential member," so said the
                  minister of Zion chapel, who filled the post, once occupied by Mr. Ashley, when he
                  preached the funeral sermon on the following sabbath.</p>
               <p>"So old Thomas Milton has dropped off at last; well, he was a close fisted old
                  fellow; but it seems as if one of the props of the town had fallen, we have been
                  so used to see him taking his walk as regular as clock-work, from his house to the
                  Town Hall. He was a man of substance. I wonder who'll get the old fellow's money;
                  not that ne'er-do-well brother of his, surely," said the majority of the
                  towns-people who had no particular interest in the chapel of which he had been the
                  wealthiest member, and, "so old deacon Milton's gone, I wonder who'll get his
                  money, he must left a pretty penny behind him;" echoed a hundred gossips, over the
                  tea-table, the day that the tidings had gone forth that old Deacon Milton was no
                  more.</p>
               <p>Jemmy Milton, the old sailor the fisherman was, so far as was known, his only
                  living relative, consequently, the only person who had any natural claim to his
                  late brother's wealth; but, few persons thought that the deacon had left his
                  property unrestrictedly to his brother. There had never existed any fraternity of
                  feeling between them, and beyond an ordinary recognition, a nod of the head, and a
                  brief good-day when they met, they had held no intercourse with each other,
                  excepting on the occasions when Jemmy went to the deacon's house, four times a
                  year, to receive his quarterly dole of salary. The leading members of the chapel
                  thought a large portion of his money would be found to be left to the chapel, some
                  of them thought that they might themselves come in for an individual share—as a
                  token of the long friendship that had existed between them and the deceased.
                  Others believed it not unlikely, now that the deacon could no longer enjoy the
                  contemplation of the wealth he was too niggardly to spend, even for his own
                  comfort and gratification, that he had bequeathed at least some portion of it to
                  the public charities of the town, or to the poor among the congregation of his own
                  chapel, or, perchance, to the endowment of some beneficent institution that might
                  be a lasting monument to his memory—there were the charitably inclined; others
                  said that the ghost of the deceased deacon would haunt the town if the money were
                  thus scattered that he had amassed with so much pains and hoarded with so much
                  care, and hinted that it would be discovered,<pb n="288-289"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000145"/> when his will came to be examined, that he had
                  devised some scheme to carry his treasure with him to the tomb, or, at least, had
                  given directions that it should be expended in the erection of a splendid monument
                  over his grave. These were the decidedly uncharitable.</p>
               <p>All these calculations, however, were doomed to disappointment. It was soon known
                  that the vicar of the parish, with whom the deacon had never been on terms of
                  close intimacy, was the executor of the deceased, and that Jemmy Milton was the
                  sole legatee. With the exception of Dr. Knight's fee for his medical services,
                  calculated to the utmost degree of nicety, for the deacon had preserved his
                  faculties unimpaired until a few hours before his death, and had only probably
                  sent for the vicar the day before it occurred, and five pounds bequeathed to the
                  vicar, for the purchase of a new gown, as some compensation for his trouble in
                  accepting the office of executor—all the property bequeathed, without restriction,
                  to his brother, and thus Jemmy Milton found himself in the unexpected possession
                  of ten thousand pounds sterling—a mint of wealth in the eyes of the good people of
                  Herrington.</p>
               <p>Much and grievous disappointment was felt at this natural and just disposal of his
                  property by the deacon, and no little indignation was openly expressed by those
                  who had hoped to profit by the death of the deceased miser, whose memory was now
                  most sorely traduced by those who had most fawned upon him, while living.</p>
               <p>The matter, however, after having been the main topic of conversation and the
                  chief source of gossip for a season, passed at length into oblivion, and with it,
                  the deacon himself, who, living as he had lived in Herrington. had left no real
                  friend to mourn his loss—no widow or orphan to bless and revere his memory.</p>
               <p>This sudden accession to wealth was the source of great trouble to Jemmy Milton.
                  The deacon's property was nearly all in ready money. He had amused his fortune, in
                  the first instance, by smuggling, in which nefarious profession he had been very
                  successful in early life, and he had, subsequently, increased it by lending out
                  small sums at usurious interest to the needy among the townspeople and the farmers
                  in the vicinity; but, in his later years, he had grown so cautious and so fond of
                  retaining his money in his own possession, that he had called in his loans, and
                  deposited the money in an iron safe, set into the wall in the bedroom in which he
                  slept, the key of which was tied to a string worn round his neck. No one in the
                  town, however, was aware of this, he had managed his affairs with so much secrecy;
                  and, although it was known that he had withdrawn his money from the Herrington
                  bank, he had managed to cause it to be generally believed that he had deposited
                  it, for greater security, in a bank in London. To London the money had been
                  transmitted, by the advice of the vicar, shortly after the deacon's death, and,
                  after the funeral had taken place, Jemmy, clad for the first time in his life, in
                  a new suit of black broadcloth, had gone himself up to London as he sid, to look
                  about him a bit, and traverse his old cruising ground, Ratcliffe Highway and
                  Wapping, and work off the melancholy, for the old deacon, though his brother had
                  never encouraged any fraternal feeling, had been his brother still, and he was
                  now, as he said, an old hulk, left quite alone in the world.</p>
               <p>However, Jemmy soon returned from London and took up his quarters at his former
                  lodgings, the cottage of a middle aged widow left with a large family of children,
                  her husband having been drowned at sea two or there years before the deacon's
                  decease. Jemmy had lived with the family, the widow's husband having been an old
                  shipmate of his, for several years, and after the husband's death he had still
                  continued to reside with the window.</p>
               <p>Immediately upon his return from London he had doffed his mourning suit, merely
                  reserving the crape around his hat, and had resumed his old, seaman's garb, for,
                  as he said, in that "long toggery," he felt like a craft whose backstays had been
                     set<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7199-00000146"/> up too taut, and that
                  consequently jerked terrible hard in steering.</p>
               <p>A few days, after his return to Herrington he called upon Mr. Pearce, at the
                  vicarage. At the vicar's request he was shown by the servant who admitted him into
                  the study.</p>
               <p>"Ha! Mr. Milton," said the vicar, "how are you to-day? I thought you were in
                  London. I had no idea that you would return so soon. But take a seat, my old
                  friend, take a seat," and he handed a chair to his visitor.</p>
               <p>"Thank'ee sir," replied Jemmy taking the proffered seat, "I am quite well, and I
                  hope you are the same. I came back from Lunnun near a week ago. Couldn't find any
                  pleasure there, sir, Wapping and Ratcliffe highway ain't what they used to be, but
                  I beg pardon, sir. ou'll excuse this 'ere toggery as I've got on, but I could'nt
                  stand that 'ere swaller-tail any longer. I was like as if I was in the bilboes,
                  when I wore it. Mayhap I should have enjoyed myself better in Lunnun if I'd ha'
                  gone up there in Christian-like toggery, axing your pardon for speakin' so
                  bold."</p>
               <p>"Not at all, not at all, Mr. Milton," said the vicar, "every one has a perfect
                  right to dress as he pleases, and it is only natural that you should feel most at
                  ease in the attire to which you have been accustomed all your life."</p>
               <p>"I should like, Mr. Pearce," said the old man, "that you'd call me Jemmy. It's the
                  name as I've been used to and like the old duds, it seems to fit me best. I hardly
                  know who the folks mean when they 'dresses me as Mr. Milton."</p>
               <p>"Jemmy, then, if you please," said the vicar, "although I believe I have generally
                  addressed you as Mr. Milton."</p>
               <p>"To be sure, sir, you have, and I didn't mind it from you in old times, seeing as
                  you was the reverend. But every one calls me so now. It's <emph>Mister</emph>
                  Milton here, and <emph>Mister</emph> Milton there, till I'm well a nigh crazed.
                  But I've taken the liberty of callin' to ask some advice of you, sir."</p>
               <p>"What is it, Jemmy, since so I must designate you?" said' the vicar. "I shall be
                  happy, I'm sure, to afford you any ad vice to the best of my ability."</p>
               <p>"It's about this here money that my brother left me, sit," said Jemmy, "it's a
                  great trouble to me, sir."</p>
               <p>"It is a talent entrusted to your care which it is your duty to put out at
                  interest," replied the vicar.</p>
               <p>"That's what ever body tells me," said Jemmy. "<emph>Mister</emph> Milton," says
                  they, "You should put that there money out to good interest, and one advises this,
                  and t'other that, till I'm a'most crazed. Lor' bless you, sir, axin' your pardon,
                  there's more than I can spend, without puttin' it out to interest, if I was to
                  live to be as old again as I am now."</p>
               <p>"You mistake me, my friend," smilingly replied the vicar. "Although the advice
                  given is still good in a worldly point of view. When I spoke of putting the talent
                  entrusted to your care out at interest, I meant that it was your duty so to use
                  it, as to benefit your less fortunate fellow creatures, and so obtain hereafter
                  the reward that is promised to those who assist the sick and needy for the love
                  they bear to him who gave them their abundance."</p>
               <p>"You talk reasonable, sir, in that, but it puts me out of patience to hear folks
                  tellin' on me, to make the most of my money, as if money was every thing to an old
                  man like me, who has lived on fifty pounds a year and though it wealth. Besides
                  Jemmy Milton ain't such a fool as not to see, as these folks has their own ends to
                  sarve."</p>
               <p>"What have you thought of doing, Jemmy? How have you concluded to dispose of your
                  recently acquired wealth?" asked the vicar.</p>
               <p>"Why, sir, I'm an old man, and can't reasonably expect my worn out timbers to hang
                  together many years longer. I can't think of changing my mode of living, for I
                  shouldn't be happy any other way. I have been thinking, sir, I ought to make a
                  will."</p>
               <p>"And a very good thought too, Jemmy," said the vicar. "By-the-by, what is your
                  age?"</p>
               <p>"Dues your reverence know what age they put on my brother's coffin?" asked
                  Jemmy.</p>
               <pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7199-00000147"/>
               <p>"Seventy-two years and nine months, I believe," replied the vicar.</p>
               <p>"Well then, I've always heerd that I was four years younger than Tummas. That
                  makes me to be——</p>
               <p>"Sixty-eight years old," said the vicar.</p>
               <p>"'Xactly, sir; very good. Now a man as has seed hardships, and is sixty-eight
                  years old, can't expect to live many years longer. I feels old age a creepin' over
                  me now. The rheaumatis' troubles o' nights, and I feels aches and pains in my
                  limbs, specially in the great toe as got frost-bit, and was amputated when I was
                  on board a North Sea whaler twenty-five years ago. That ere great toe trouble me
                  terrible, sir."</p>
               <p>"I hope you'll live to see many more years yet, Jemmy," said the vicar, smiling at
                  the old man's singular conceit. 'You're a hale, hearty man for one of your years;
                  still, it is a prudent thought of yours to make your will while in sound health of
                  body and mind. When do you think of setting about it? I shall be happy to afford
                  you any assistance you may require."</p>
               <p>"There's a many as advises me agin it, sir," continued Jemmy. "They says that when
                  a man makes his will, it's a sure sign as he's a goin' to slip off the hooks;
                  'specially the widdies and old maids goes agin it. I was a talkin' about it over
                  at my lodgings the night arter I come from Lunnun, and Peggy Nelson, she as I
                  boards with, had axed six or seven women-folk of her acquaintance to tea to meet
                  me and welcome me home agin, as she said. After tea, they all begins to pitch into
                  me about my money, and to 'gratulate me, as they says, on comin' into the deacon's
                  fortun'. Says I, 'yes, it's a great sight of money for an old man to fall
                  alongside of, and I'm thinking as I ought to make a will.'</p>
               <p>"'Lauks,' says they. all at a time, 'I hope you'll remember your old friends then,
                     <emph>Mister</emph> Milton?' And then, says one, 'To think of
                     <emph>Mister</emph> Milton a calling of hisself an old man, Peggy, when I
                  warrant me there's many a young 'ooman as' be glad to set up her cap at him sooner
                  than at half the men as calls theirselves young, let alone the widdies,' says she;
                  and then chimes in another, 'For my part, I never fancy a man when he's too
                  young.' She was an old maid, precious near as old as I be, and she says, 'I allers
                  turned my face agin very young men, and I've had a many offers. No, no, give me a
                  sober, steady man, in the prime of life'—squintin' awful at me—'one as has got
                  over the follies of youth, and as is a good purvider.'</p>
               <p>"After they wor all gone, Peggy Nelson fetched out a bottle of holland's, and
                  brewed a couple of glasses of hot toddy, and, says she, '<emph>Mister</emph>
                  Milton'—she always called me Jemmy afore, and I knowed as how summut was
                     commin'—'<emph>Mister</emph> Milton,' says she, 'them folks as is gone talks a
                  good deal of nonsense; but, Lor' bless ye, they means nought. Still,' says she,
                  sittin' up closer alongside of me, "there be some truth in what they says. You're
                  a man of substance now,' says she, 'and you'll find the need of somebody to buss
                  you, and take care on ye, and make you comfortable, though I don't say anything
                  agin my neighbors, But I can't say as I think any of them would be the woman as
                  'ud make you a good wife;' and then she sipped her toddy, and axed me if mine was
                  sweet enough, and pressed me to drink it up and have some more; and when she'd
                  mixed me the second glass, she sits for some time silent, squintin' at me now and
                  then, and a droppin, of her eyes when I chanced to look at her, like a young gal
                  of sixteen. At last, she says:</p>
               <p>"It <emph>was</emph> terr'bl dull when you was up there at Lunnun, Mr Milton.'</p>
               <p>"'I wish, Peggy, you'd call me Jemmy, as is my nat'ral name,' says I.</p>
               <p>"'It's the name I love to call you by,' says she, 'but I thought, now you'd come
                  in fortun', as it would be disrespectful-like; but since you wishes it, I
                     <emph>will</emph> call you Jemmy. It <emph>was terr'bl</emph>' dull when you
                  was up at Lunnun, Jemmy,' she repeats, a winkin' at me agin.</p>
               <pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7199-00000148"/>
               <p>"'I found it dull,' I says; 'I was main glad to get home agin, Peggy.'</p>
               <p>"'No! Was you, now?' says she. 'Well. and it's astonishin' how the children took
                  on after ye. 'When'll feyther come back, mammy?' says little Molly. And, 'I shall
                  be so glad to see feyther agin,' says Bobby. You know they all call you feyther,
                  Jemmy?'—a winkin' at me agin—'for you was always so good to them; just as kind as
                  their own poor feyther,' and Peggy put her apron to her eyes and begun to rub 'em
                  till they got as red as if she'd a been peelin' ingyens; but she soon put it down
                  agin, and goes on; 'you was always a bringin' on 'em apples and shrimps and perry
                  winkles,' says she; 'and your face was always so smiling and good-natured, that
                  you reminded me of my own good man that's dead and buried in his salt sea grave,'
                  and up went the apron agin. 'He was a good man,' says she, 'and please God, while
                  he lived, I made him a good wife, and we had a large and interestin' family of
                  children. Ah! Jemmy Milton, it ain't till a body's been married and is left a
                  disconsolate widdy, that they feels what was the happiness of a married life,' and
                  she began a winkin' at me worser than ever.</p>
               <p>"Howsomever, I said nought that night, and when I refused to have any more toddy,
                  she got up and bid me good night, as affectionate like, as if I was a goin' to be
                  drownded myself the next day.</p>
               <p>"When I got to my own room and turned in, I says to myself, 'Jemmy Milton,' says
                  I, 'there's materomony in this here drift of wind; them old maids and disconsolate
                  widdys didn't come to tea last night without some reason of their own; and Peggy
                  Nelson wasn't a talkin' about the children, and of my bein' like a feyther to 'em
                  and a winkin' at me, and a wipin' her eyes with her apron, for nought. Now, Jemmy,
                  don't you be a driftin' into materomony at your age, like a ship 'ithout a pilot,
                  that's lost her steerage-way, after having lived true to poor Jane's memory so
                  long.' And then I began to think it was terr'ble lonesome-like lying in bed alone,
                  and how I'd read in the bible, that David, when he got old, got a young wife to
                  keep him warm, and take care on him; and thinks I, I'll call on the vicar in the
                  morning and ax him, and take his advice on the subject, but I felt too
                  bashful-like, and I put off calling; but the next day and the next, I had to
                  submit to the same persecution, 'till I got fidgetty, and to think that a wife
                  wouldn't be such a bad thing, after all, and Peggy's a good-looking woman for her
                  years, and made a good wife to Jack Nelson, so at last I made up my mind to ask
                  your reverence's advice about materomony and the makin' on a will."</p>
               <p>The vicar had listened patiently to Jemmy's long story without speaking a word,
                  though he occasionally smiled at some odd conceit of the narrator's; but when he
                  had concluded, he said:—</p>
               <p>"With respect to the subject of matrimony, Jemmy, I have nothing to say, though if
                  you insist upon my advice, I should say, since you have lived so long single, at
                  your age I think you would be running a great risk in taking a wife. These ladies,
                  it seems, never pressed you thus before; it is your money that is the temptation
                  now."</p>
               <p>"To be sure it is, sir," said Jemmy, "axing your pardon for interrupting you, sir;
                  and I'll still remain true to my poor Jane's memory. But about the will, sir?"</p>
               <p>"I was about to say in regard to that subject," resumed the vicar, "that I think
                  it will be a very sensible action on your part. If I were in your place, I would
                  set about it immediately."</p>
               <p>"So I will, then," said Jemmy; "but there won't be any need on calling in a
                  lawyer?"</p>
               <p>"Not necessarily, so that the will is drawn out and signed in the presence of
                  witnesses, although, to be sure that no errors are made, it might be as well to
                  get a lawyer to draw out the document."</p>
               <p>"It'll be so plain, I shall make no errors, sir," said Jemmy,<pb n="296-297"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000149"/> "and I'll do without a lawyer, if possible: I never
                  liked 'em, at sea nor ashore—the breed's bad; a sea-lawyer is a curse aboard of a
                  ship."</p>
               <p>"I presume you can to without," said the vicar, smiling at the old man's
                  prejudices.</p>
               <p>"Can't is be done at once, sir?" asked Jemmy.</p>
               <p>"I suppose so," answered the vicar. "Have you the premises drawn out?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know what you mean, sir?" replied the old man; "but if you'd be kind
                  enough to write down what I say, I'll be obliged to you, and you can be the
                  witness."</p>
               <p>"We shall require another, I believe," rejoined the vicar, "though I am so
                  ignorant of the necessary forms, that I cannot be sure that such is the case."</p>
               <p>"Draw it out, and I'll get Doctor Knight to call with me to-morrow, and sign it,"
                  said Jemmy.</p>
               <p>"I will, if you require it," said the vicar, and taking a quire of paper from his
                  desk, and his pen in his hand, he wrote at Jemmy's dictation, making his own
                  amendments to the style and syntax, as follows:—</p>

                  that'ere trap to catch me in the bonds o' matermony, but Peggy Nelson'll be

               <p>"Good day, Jemmy," replied the vicar, and the old man left the parsonage.</p>
               <p>Many months passed away before Jemmy was allowed any peace—at least so he
                  averred—by the antiquated spinsters and disconsolate "widdys," who were eager to
                  entice him into their toils, but he prove obdurate and resisted all their
                  blandishments, and at last they gave up the idea of bringing him to their feet,
                  and Jemmy was allowed to smoke his pipe and drink his beer in peace in his
                  favorite retreat at the old boathouse on Herrington beach.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Explaining how Minette manages to procure an interview with Alice, at the
                     Convent at Orleans, and showing the result of the interview.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MINETTE, the waiting-maid of Alice Thornton, whom Mr. Craddock had discharged in
                  Paris, after his return with his niece from Cuba, had been engaged after Alice had
                  left the convent school expressly to attend her during the voyage to the West
                  Indies. She was a native of the French capital, and had passed through various
                  grades, from a singing girl in the street, to a flower vender, and thence to
                  become a children's "<emph>bone.</emph>" Her agreeable and intelligent appearance
                  had attracted the notice of Mr. Craddock, and he had offered her good wages to
                  accompany his niece. It had required some persuasion on the part of Mr. Craddock
                  to induce Minette to leave her dear Paris, but ambition at length prevailed over
                  inclination, and Minette found herself promoted to the post of ladies' maid, the
                  acme of her ambition, until, in the course of a few years more she should marry
                  some student or painter from the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Quartier Latin,</foreign>
                  and settle down as a married woman, for life. Nor was this latter altogether a
                  vague idea on the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">une affaire de la cœur</foreign> on
                  hand, which promised to ripen into marriage, the object of her admiration being a
                  young artist, who was copying at the Louvre, and living and working cheerfully on,
                  in the hope of one day securing fame, fortune, and Minette; and when the young
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">soubrette</foreign> had engaged to attend Ma'mselle
                  Alice, she had been partly tempted to undertake the voyage and forego the delights
                  of Paris for a season, in hopes that the wages she would save<pb n="300-301"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000151"/> would help to forward the happy consummation to
                  which both she and Armand both looked forward with much impatience and not a
                  little anxiety.</p>
               <p>Minette possessed most of the virtues and frailties of her class. She was capable
                  of strong attachment to those who treated her kindly, and at the same time prone
                  to resent, without particular regard to the means she employed, any slight that
                  she believed she had received. She had become much attached to Alice, who,
                  perhaps, for want of any other female friend to converse with, had made her her
                  confidant. During her residence at the convent school, Alice had acquired a fair
                  acquired a fair acquaintance with the French language, nothing else being spoken
                  by her teachers and daily companions, and from subsequently conversing in that
                  language with tolerable fluency. the most shrewd and cautions often overreach
                  themselves, and Mr. craddock was little aware that in engaging this humble French
                  waiting-maid, he was opening the way to the eventual discovery and overthrow of
                  his scheme of aggrandisement. It had never struck him, singular as it may appear,
                  that Alice would ever make a confidant of her maid, or that a simple <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">soubrette</foreign> could, by any possible means, defeat the
                  object of his ambition.</p>
               <p>Minette was glad to return to <foreign xml:lang="FRA">la belle France,</foreign>
                  yet she would willingly have remained for a longer period in the service of her
                  young mistress; the object of her service was not yet attained; her purse had not
                  yet acquired the plethoric fulness that she wished to see. She had heard enough of
                  Alices history to suspect that something was wrong, though, as Alice herself was
                  ignorant of the real object of her uncle, the waiting-maid, of course, could not,
                  with all her shrewdness, divine the cause of his actions. She knew, however, that
                  Ma'mselle Alice had been sent to school at a convent, in Orleans, and that she was
                  not permitted to correspond with her former friends. She knew that Alice cherished
                  a secret affection, and this excited her sympathies, and she saw, on parting with
                  her young mistress, that she was overpowered by some secret grief, and she
                  earnestly inquired its cause. Mr. Craddock was present, and in no gentle mood at
                  the time. He reproved her harshly for what he called impertinent curiosity, and
                  told her that as he had paid her her wages, she might depart as soon as possible;
                  neither he nor Miss Alice had further occasion for her services.</p>
               <p>Minette stole one glance at Alice. The sad smile of farewell on her lips, while
                  the tears filled her eyes, touched the heart of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >soubrette,</foreign> and the harsh words of Mr. Craddock had deeply wounded
                  her pride. She smiled at Alice in return—a smile full of deep meaning—and then
                  haughtily throwing back her head, she retreated from the room with the stately
                  step of a duchess.</p>
               <p>"Ha!" she exclaimed, as soon as she was out of hearing, "Quelle hauteur, sur la
                  part de cet Monsieur Craddock, je suis pauvre, ha! Je ne besoin pas que les gages.
                  Cést assez, mà'mselle sera vengè."</p>
               <p>Minette lost no time in seeking out Armand. He had been successful, and was elated
                  with pride. HE had painted a picture which had gained the prize at the last
                  distribution. This success had procured him several orders, and he had earned
                  since Minette had quitted Pairs what appeared to him a large sum of money. He
                  urged upon her their immediate union.</p>
               <p>"No so fast, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon cher Armand,</foreign>" replied Minette,
                  submitting herself, however, with a good grace to her lover's caresses.</p>
               <p>You have yet a task to accomplish; that done, I will be your wife."</p>
               <p>"What is that?" demanded Armand in great surprise. Minette related what had passed
                  when she parted from her young mistress.</p>
               <p>"The poor child is betrayed, Armand," she said. "I know not; she knows not whither
                  she is going; but she has been to the convent school at Orleans, I believe her

                  perhaps to immure her forever in the convent, so that she shall never marry him
                  she loves. Think of that, Armand. Is it not terrible?"</p>
               <p>"But what can I do, Minette?" said Armand, who by no means fancied the idea of
                  deferring their union until he had accomplished the seemingly hopeless and
                  Quixotic task of delivering a young lady from a convent. "I cannot release the
                  poor lady."</p>
               <p>"Ah, Armand, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">comme vous etes nigaud!</foreign>" said
                  Minette, playfully patting her lover's cheek. "Who said, <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >mon petit,</foreign> that you were to deliver the young lady from the convent?
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Mon dieu!</foreign> I don't know that she is going
                  there. I have only my suspicious. You must learn, Armand."</p>
               <p>"But how, Minette"?"</p>
               <p>The thing is simple. We will wait awhile. I already know, however, that Monsieur
                  has taken two places in the diligence for Orleans to-night. That strengthens my
                  suspicions. In the course of a week, you will accompany me to that city. You have
                  that pretty painting of the holy family nearly finished?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Armand, glancing at the picture on his easel, and wondering what
                  that had to do with the question at issue.</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Ma foi!</foreign> Armand, you must give me that picture
                  as a last gift for my sister."</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Que diable!</foreign> I don't understand," said Armand.
                  "What give you my picture which will bring me two hundred francs?"</p>
               <p>"And I am not worth that sacrifice?" said Minette, pouting prettily.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and a thousand more," said Armand; "but what will that effect?"</p>
               <p>"We will go together to Orleans, Armand, you and I, and I will go to the convent
                  and learn from the porteress, by means of a trifling bribe, whether a young lady
                  answering the description of Ma'mselle Alice, who was formerly at school there,
                  has returned."</p>
               <p>"And then?" said Armand.</p>
               <p>"Why then, I will take the picture and ask to see the superior. I shall be
                  admitted,. I will then say that I have called to see my sister for the last time
                  before she takes the veil, and wish to give, in her name, this picture of the holy
                  family to the convent. It is superb, Armand. You will one day be a great painter,"
                  continued Minette with-directed flattery. "And the offer will be accepted; for the
                  sake of obtaining the picture, I shall be permitted to see <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >Ma'mselle.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"And what object will that effect" said Armand, still undecided.</p>
               <p>"I will learn what are the names of her friends in England. A whisper will tell
                  me, and I shall recollect well. I am quick at such things. Ma'mselle never told me
                  yet, for fear of her uncle. She will tell me now, if things be as I fear, and then
                  you, Armand, who are so clever, and can do everything, shall write to her
                  friends—to her lover, perhaps, and he will be so rejoiced, he will pay you more
                  than two hundred francs for the loss of your picture."</p>
               <p>This last suggestion was cleverly thrown in by the shrewd <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >soubrette,</foreign> and went somewhat to reconcile Armand to the loss of his
                  painting. After considerable demur, he suffered himself to be persuaded by his
                  mistress, and consented to the arrangement, although he still asserted that he
                  considered it an absurd scheme.</p>
               <p>However, the painting was finished, and week after this conversation, Minette and
                  her lover were in the city of Orleans.</p>
               <p>Minettee soon ascertained that her suspicions were correct, and that Alice was in
                  the convent, and by the promise of another bribe to the porteress, she obtained
                  permission to call again on the following day, when the porteress promised to
                  introduce her to the superior.</p>
               <p>Minette was there at the hour appointed, and after waiting for a short time, was
                  presented to the superior. She carried the painting, set in a neat frame, and
                  carefully wrapped in canvas, under her arm.</p>
               <pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7199-00000153"/>
               <p>"What do you wish to say to me, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ma chere?</foreign>"
                  demanded the superior.</p>
               <p>"I have called, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">madame,</foreign>" said Minette, "to beg
                  permission to bid adieu to my sister Alice, who came last week to this convent.
                  You will not refuse me, Madame? I shall then never see her again."</p>
               <p>"The young lady Alice, who will soon change the name she has been known by in the
                  world, has no sister, I have been informed," said the superior.</p>
               <p>"No, madame," said Minette with admirable presence of mind, recovering herself
                  from the blunder she saw she had made, "I am not her sister, madame, but we have
                  been friends, and I love her as a sister. I was far away, in Paris, when she came
                  here, and I have come all the way to see her once more you will not refuse me that
                  little pleasure, Madame?"</p>
               <p>"It is against the rules," replied the superior, who however, was touched by the
                  proof of affection that had induced a young girl to travel all the way from Paris
                  to see her friend once again. The asceticism of the convent had not altogether
                  destroyed, though it had deadened the sympathies of her woman's heart. However,
                  she till hesitated. "What have you there?" she asked sharply, and with some degree
                  of suspicion in her tone.</p>
               <p>"A picture," said Minette, undoing the parcel, "which I have to offer to Madame,
                  on behalf of my sister Alice, as you will permit me still to call her."</p>
               <p>"It is very beautiful!" said the Superior, admiring the painting, which Minette
                  had taken from its covering and exposed in a good light, "and I thank you, my good
                  girl; but, I forgot, Sister Alice is English and you are French. How came you to
                  be acquainted with her?"</p>
               <p>"I and Alice have travelled much together, madame," replied Minette. "It is no
                  reason because our countries are different that we should not be friends and
                  sisters."</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Bein!" replied the Superior, "I will break through the regulations
                  for once. You shall see sister Alice, but it must be in my presence."</p>
               <p>"I am content," replied Minette.</p>
               <p>The Superior summoned an attendant and in the course of a few minutes Alice
                  appeared. The moment she Minettee she rushed into her arms. All distinction of
                  social position was forgotten in her joy at seeing a friendly and sympathizing
                  face again.</p>
               <p>The Superior was overcome by this exhibition of feeling. She relaxed her severity
                  of countenance, saying:—</p>
               <p>"You can walk together on the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">parterre,</foreign> in front
                  of the hall, my children, and I will remain here; then you must bid each other
                  farewell."</p>
               <p>This was more than Minette had dared to hope. The two went into the garden, and
                  Minette hastily explained to Alice the object of her visit. "You must tell me now
                  what you have so often feared to tell; you will have no other opportunity she
                  said.</p>
               <p>They saw that their movements were closely watched by the jealous superior, and
                  Alice strove hard to render the name and address of Mr. Pearce familiar to the
                  lips of Minette, but the case appeared almost a hopeless one to her French organs
                  of articulation. At length Minette observed that the superior's back was
                  turned:—</p>
               <p>"Write, Mam'selle," she said huriedly, "here is pencil; and paper. I came provided
                  for all emergencies." And Alice hastily and tremblingly wrote the address, "Rev.
                  Mr. Pearce Herrington vicarage."</p>
               <p>"That is all I can do," she said, handing the slip of paper to her humble
                  friend.</p>
               <p>"And it is enough, if this <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Monsieur</foreign> be living,"
                  said Minette. "Adieu, I see the Superior is beckoning to us; the half hour is
                  expired; be of good courage, mam'selle, you shall soon, <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >plait à Dieu!</foreign> be delivered from this place."</p>
               <p>Adieus were interchanged, and soon Minette was again beyond<pb n="306-307"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000154"/> yond the convent walls. Fearful of discovery she
                  and Armand set out that night for Paris, and on their arrival there Armand at the
                  dictation of his mistress wrote a letter in French to Mr. Pearce explaining all
                  that it lay in Minette's power to explain. The letter was duly received, and read
                  by the vicar with the utmost amazement and indignation. He immediately wrote to
                  Gerald, enclosing a copy of the French letter, expressing his opinion that some
                  fraud had been or was about be perpetrated, and his belief that the letter was
                  authentic. Gerald's address was still at the Cheringhee Road, Calcutta, and
                  thither the letter was directed to him, and a duplicate was also sent to Mr.
                  Ashley in case the young man should have left Calcutta, and have visited Colombo,
                  which Mr. Pearce did not consider at all improbable.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Meloncholy news and its results.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>LETTERS came at last from Colombo and Calcutta, but there was no news from
                  England, and Gerald's despondency increased notwithstanding the endeavors of his
                  cousin to cheer him.</p>
               <p>"Why give to this anxiety, Gerald?" he said, "you know the old adage, 'No news is
                  good news." Had anything serious occurred you would have been written to by some
                  one or other. But your last letter has little more than reached home. Cheer up,
                  you will get a reply to it in good time and all will be well."</p>
               <p>And Gerald was fain to confess, that he had no reason to give for his despondency
                  beyond the impression left on his mind by the singular dream he had dreamed,
                  shortly after the frigate had cast anchor in the port of Singapore—and the waking
                  vision, as he still persisted in terming it, which had preceded it. He endeavored
                  to drive away his melancholy, by entering into all the amusements of his brother
                  officers with alacrity; but the effort was a vain one. If he succeeded during the
                  day in banishing these forebodings of evil form his mind, they returned at night
                  with redoubled intensity, and he was glad, when, at the expiration of another
                  month, orders were received for the frigate to proceed to Bombay, and,
                  subsequently, to cruise in the Arabian Sea. He though that any change were
                  preferable, that by calling his attention to fresh scenes, might serve to dispel
                  the gloom that burthened his spirits.</p>
               <pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7199-00000155"/>
               <p>For five months the frigate remained in the Bombay station, and then returned to
                  Colombo.</p>
               <p>As soon as was practicable, after the vessel was brought to an anchor, Frederick
                  and Gerald obtained permission from the Captain to go on shore and visit their
                  friends.</p>
               <p>Letters were now awaiting Gerald. He started with horror on perceiving that the
                  superscription on both was in the handwriting of the vicar of Herrington, and that
                  both were scaled with black wax, and staggered back to the cane sofa from which he
                  had risen when the letters were handed to him by his uncle, as if he had been
                  shot. The letters had fallen from his hand, and were picked up from the floor and
                  re-presented to him by his cousin, Henry.</p>
               <p>"Read them," he gasped, addressing his uncle, "I dare not."</p>
               <p>Mr. Ashley received them from him, and broke the seals. The first one opened was
                  from Armand, the lover of Minette, with postscript at the bottom of the page
                  explained the cause of the black seal.</p>
               <p>"Since this was written," wrote the vicar, "I have received sad news from
                  Abottsford. Your mother is no more. I was about to dispatch this letter to the
                  post, when I received intelligence of her death. I shall detain it a few days,
                  until I hear further from the Rev. Mr. Davis, who has promised to write me, at
                  greater length."</p>
               <p>The second letter was also from the vicar, and furnished a brief account of the
                  details received from the Rector of Abbottsford, following which, was some other
                  information of a nature calculated greatly to interest the young man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ashley read both these letters in silence; but from the expression of his
                  countenance, Gerald readily divined the nature of the communications.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to say that these letters bring sad intelligence from home, Gerald,"
                  he observed, making an effort to control his own agitation. "Your poor mother is
                  dead——"</p>
               <p>"I knew it—I knew it," replied Gerald, and turning to Frederick, who stood by he
                  said almost fiercely: "Was I not forewarned of this? Will you now deny that I was
                  not wide awake when I saw that vision?"</p>
               <p>Frederick made no reply. He was himself too much shocked to speak.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ashley was about to place the letters again in his nephew's hand; but Gerald
                  motioned him back.</p>
               <p>"Not now, uncle;" he said, "please, not just now. Will you lay them on the table—I
                  will read them another time—another time."</p>
               <p>He spoke so wildly, and his countenance had assumed so strange an expression that
                  Mr. Ashley became alarmed.</p>
               <p>"You are ill, Gerald," he said, kindly, "the shock has been too much for you; but,
                  there is other news contained in these letters which you will be glad to
                  learn."</p>
               <p>"Not now, uncle; not now," repeated Gerald, "I will soon retire to my room, and
                  read the letters alone—Frederick—Henry—will you bring me a glass of water, I feel
                  faint."</p>
               <p>His cousins hastened to comply with his request; but before the water was brought,
                  he had fainted, and lay in a state of unconsciousness on the sofa.</p>
               <p>"Poor fellow!" exclaimed Mrs. Ashley, as she untied his cravat, and, assisted by
                  her husband, endeavored to restore him to himself. "It is a dreadful blow,
                  indeed." She applied the customary restoratives, and in a few minutes the young
                  man opened his eyes and glared wildly around him. Mrs. Ashley put the glass of
                  water to his lips and he drank it greedily. Then passing his hand over his brow,
                  as one bewildered, or who has awakened from a frightful dream, he said, "Ha!
                  recollect now—my mother is dead, you say—I knew it—I knew it, months ago, yes,
                  months ago."</p>
               <p>Mr. and Mrs. Ashley were alarmed; they thought his reason<pb n="310-311"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000156"/> had become unsettled. He again fixed his gaze upon
                  his cousin, Frederick, in a manner so peculiar, that they looked at the young man
                  for an explanation, when Gerald suddenly cried; "Answer me one question,
                  uncle—when did this happen; when did my mother die?"</p>
               <p>"Shortly before midnight on the 17th of March," replied Mr. Ashley.</p>
               <p>"Frederick," said Gerald, "you recollect I told you it was at six o'clock on the
                  morning of the 18th of March just at the break of day, when the vision vanished,
                  and I become conscious that I had sat for hours, in fact, during the whole night
                  before my chest in the Cabin. That was the exact hour of my mother's death,
                  allowing for the difference of time between England and Singapore. I will go to my
                  room, now," he continued, "if you will assist me there; I feel so weak. I will
                  take these letters with me and read them, alone, by and by."</p>
               <p>Mr. Ashley and his son assisted him to the room, and offered to stay with him but
                  he declined the offer.</p>
               <p>"Do not be alarmed," he said in reply to their expressions of fear least he might
                  again be taken ill. "I shall not faint again. It was the effect of the shock
                  received so suddenly. I would rather be left quite alone."</p>
               <p>His request was acceded to; but Mr. Ashley, before he left him, informed him that
                  one of the letters contained some interesting information relating to Alice
                  Thornton.</p>
               <p>For a moment his eye brightened and his animation appeared to be restored; but he
                  speedily relapsed and reiterated his desire to be left alone.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Ashley and Frederick returned to the apartment in which they had left
                  Mrs. Ashley and Henry, he explained to the astonished group the cause of the
                  strange observations that his cousin Gerald had made, and related the particulars
                  of the singular vision that had occurred to him in the harbor of Singapore.</p>
               <p>"It is indeed a strange coincidence," observed Mr. Ashley.</p>
               <p>"I have heard of such things, but never before had any evidence of their actually
                  occurring."</p>
               <p>The unexpected intelligence of Mrs. Dalton's death, shed a gloom over the Whole
                  family and deteriorated from the delight they would have otherwise experienced on
                  hearing that news had been received of Alice Thornton, though, in fact, Mr. Ashley
                  was ignorant of the nature of the intelligence; the copy of Armand's letter,
                  having been directed to Gerald, was of course left unread by Mr. Ashley, who only
                  gained his knowledge from the inference he drew from the allusions made to the
                  subject by Mr. Pearce in the envelope. It was a sorrowful evening to all and a sad
                  damp to the pleasure that the visit of the young men would otherwise have
                  afforded, although Mr. and Mrs. Ashley had anticipated bad news when the letters
                  with the black seals had been received.</p>
               <p>They sat up far beyond their usual hour of retiring, talking over the subject and
                  recalling to mind the latest conversations they had held with the deceased, before
                  quitting England.</p>
               <p>Poor Gerald passed a sleepless night: he sat in his room for an hour before he had
                  courage to peruse the letters; but he summoned resolution at last. The letter from
                  the vicar having special allusion to Mrs. Dalton's death, supplied the young man
                  with the information received from Mr. Davis, who had written to the effect that
                  Mrs. Dalton had been for a long time ailing, but that her death occurred very
                  suddenly, she having been confined to her bed but for a day or two. Latterly, he
                  wrote, she had expressed great anxiety with respect to her son, whom she had not
                  heard from for a long time. She feared that he was sick; perhaps that he had died
                  in a foreign land, with no one near him to soothe his last moments, and to listen
                  to his dying words. The day before her death, her mind wandered considerably, and
                  in these moments of unconsciousness she talked of him incessantly, sometimes
                  tenderly upbraiding him for not writing; sometimes talking to him, as if he were
                  present, and lavishing endearing epithets upon him; while<pb n="312-313"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000157"/> other times she addressed him earnestly and
                  sorrowfully, as if she feared alike for his spiritual and bodily welfare. Only an
                  hour or two before her death, the postman of the village had arrived with the
                  mails, and a letter was brought to the rectory-bearing the East India post mark.
                  Mr. Davis at once surmised that it was from Gerald, and he had himself been the
                  bearer of it to the dying woman. A messenger arrived at the rectory at the very
                  moment he was leaving the house, requesting his immediate attendance. It was not
                  until then that he was aware that her end was so nigh at hand. When he reached the
                  little cottage in which she lived, the doctor informed him that he had only just
                  arrived in time to see his patient alive. Consciousness had returned, and she was
                  talking sensibly with those around her. The moment he entered the sick chamber,
                  the dying woman appeared to divine the object of his visit.</p>
               <p>"You bring me news of my boy, of Gerald?" she said interrogatively. "I feel that
                  it is so. God has heard my prayers and a letter has arrived from my boy; I shall
                  again hear of him before I close my eyes forever to this world."</p>
               <p>Mr. Davis wrote that he could in no way account for this singular <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">presentiment,</foreign> as the dying woman could have had no
                  knowledge of the postman's arrival, since he came at very irregular periods, much
                  less could she have known that the East India mail had reached England, or that he
                  had received a letter from her son.</p>
               <p>He had made no remark at the time, but had taken the letter from his pocked and
                  placed it in her hand; subsequently, however, he learned from the young woman who
                  attended her, that suddenly rousing herself from a condition of stupor into which
                  she had fallen, talking wildly to her son, as if he had been present, she said:
                  "it is so; my boy has not forgotten me. Send for Mr. Davis; tell him to hasten,
                  for I have not long to live." A messenger had been immediately dispatched, and had
                  met the clergyman as he was leaving the rectory.</p>
               <p>The wasted fingers of the dying woman moved nervously as she strove to break the
                  seal. "I cannot—I cannot," she said, letting the letter fall from her hand. "Pray
                  open—the letter—and—read it—for me—" she added, addressing the rector, in
                  faltering accents, gasping at each word for breath. "Quick—quick—I have but a few
                  moments to spare; I am summoned—even—now."</p>
               <p>The clergyman hastened to obey. He read the letter aloud, but the senses of the
                  dying woman were already failing her. "Louder," she murmured feebly;
                  "louder—closer to my ear. Let me—not lose a word;" and bending his head to her ear
                  as closely as possible, the clergyman again commenced the letter, and read it to
                  the end. "Thank you—thank you," she murmured. "Thank God! Now pray with me, I have
                  but a few moments left."</p>
               <p>The clergyman knelt in prayer with all present, and when he rose from his knees,
                  consciousness had again fled from the dying woman. She lived yet for an hour, but
                  made no sign or motion 'till a few moments before the spirit departed from her.
                  Then a smile of love and tenderness passed across her wan features, and feebly
                  raising her head, she stretched out her thin fore-finger and uttered the word
                  "Remember." The hand fell heavily upon the bed, and her spirit had flown to the
                  eternal world.</p>
               <p>The clergyman, after eulogizing the character and speaking of the many Christian
                  virtues of the deceased, furthermore wrote that he had taken measures to provide
                  for the funeral, and that Mrs. Dalton had expressed a desire, a short time before
                  her death, to be interred in one particularly secluded spot in the village
                  church-yard, and that he should see that her wish was carried out.</p>
               <p>He would, he added, place a tomb-stone over the grave, at his own expense, but he
                  had thought, that in the event of her son returning to England, the young man
                  would wish to perform himself this act of filial pity; he, therefore, should
                     leave<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7199-00000158"/> that for the present, until he
                  heard from the young man in question.</p>
               <p>In the latter portion of the letter, Gerald found some intelligence, which under
                  other circumstances would have given him pleasure, but which now only increased
                  his distress and added to his bitterness of feeling. It was to the effect that Mr.
                  Hoffmann had receive his second letter from India, and had seen the captain of the
                  Seringapatam, and that he was now satisfied that he had judged the young man too
                  hastily. He asked his forgiveness for what had passed, and urged him to return
                  home,</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Gerald, bitterly: "Return home, now. It is your injustice that has led
                  to all this misery. I shall never return home again."</p>
               <p>He laid the letter aside, and opened that from the vicar relating to Alice. The
                  letter from Armand had been copied in the original language. Gerald was a very
                  poor French scholar, but with some difficulty, he managed to gather its purport.
                  His plans were altered, "Yes," he muttered, "I will return to England, and find
                  Alice, if she be living, and avenge her wrongs. She is all I care to live for now,
                  And then we will go to America together; I am weary of England, of India, of all
                  the world. but my native land shall be my future home."</p>
               <p>The information contained in this last letter seemed to distract his thoughts, in
                  some degree, from the sad intelligence contained in the former one, although he
                  now blamed himself severely for giving way to the obstinacy and pride which had
                  led him to remain in India. "Had I subdued that," he said, "I should probably have
                  myself closed my mother's dying eyes."</p>
               <p>Morning dawned, and found him still sleepless; but weary Nature at length gave
                  way, and he fell into an uneasy slumber, from which an hour afterwards he was
                  awakened by the voice of Mrs. Ashley, who came to ask how he had passed the night,
                  and to condole with him upon his loss. At her earnest persuasion, he descended
                  with her, and joined the family at the breakfast table, where he expressed to his
                  uncle his intention of immediately returning to England, if by any means he could
                  quit the frigate on so short a notice.</p>
               <p>"I don't think you will find any difficulty in doing that," said Frederick. "My
                  father will explain to the captain your object in desiring to return and I have no
                  doubt he will give his consent readily."</p>
               <p>That same day the captain's consent was obtained and the young man tendered his
                  resignation, as a matter of form. A vessel was then in port, taking in a cargo for
                  Bombay, to which port Gerald resolved to go, as thence he would be sure to find
                  vessels at all seasons bound to England, and in the course of a week he was on his
                  way thither, and almost immediately after his arrival, he took passage on board a
                  vessel bound to Liver pool.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Gerald arrives at Liverpool, and proceeds to Herrington.—His interview with the
                     vicar.—More news of Alice.—Gerald's plans.—A voyage to Cuba.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE bark Laurel, on board which Gerald had sailed from Bombay, arrived at
                  Liverpool after a favorable passage of ninety days, and, allowing himself no time
                  for rest, the young man immediately took the railroad cars, then but a few years
                  in operation, for London, whence he proceeded by stage to Herrington, and on the
                  very night of his arrival at the latter place, notwithstanding the lateness of the
                  hour, he walked to the vicarage to seek Mr. Pearce.</p>
               <p>The vicar was reading in his parlor, when the servant announced the young man's
                  presence.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Gerald Dalton, from India, is waiting in the hall, and wishes to see you,
                  sir."</p>
               <p>"Bless me!" exclaimed the vicar, closing his book and starting from his chair.
                  "Show him up directly, Thomas. Stay, I'll go myself. Who'd have thought it? What a
                  surprise! Gerald come back!" and giving vent to a dozen similar ejaculations, the
                  worthy vicar hurried down stairs and met Gerald in the hall.</p>
               <p>"Welcome back, Mr. Dalton! Welcome back, Gerald!" he said, seizing the young man's
                  extended hand, and shaking it warmly and vigorously, giving one of those hearty
                  shakes that tell one more plainly than words can express, that the welcome
                  extended is a heartfelt one. "Come up stairs, my boy; come up stairs. When did you
                  arrive? Why didn't you write and let me know that you were coming? Bless me! who'd
                  have thought of seeing you to-night? And how stout you've got; and so brown, I
                  should scarcely have know you. Take a seat; take a seat. No apologies." (Gerald
                  had apologized for his dusty, travel-soiled appearance.)</p>
               <p>And the young man took the proffered seat, and after asking several questions and
                  replying to various inquiries, at once broached the main object of his visit.</p>
               <p>"I need scarcely explain, sir," he said, "that the reason of my leaving India so
                  soon after I received your letter, has been to prosecute inquiries respecting Miss
                  Alice Thornton. Have you heard any further news of her?"</p>
               <p>"I have received two letters since, from the young Frenchman," replied the vicar,
                  "and I really begin to believe that there has been some extraordinary foul play at
                  work, more especially as Dr. Knight paid a flying visit to Paris a month or two
                  since with the express object of seeing the young man. He is an artist, and the
                  doctor says appears to be a very worthy, intelligent young fellow. He also saw the
                  young woman, Minette, who asserts that she served Alice in the capacity of
                  waiting-maid in the island of Cuba, and she appears to be a very decent young
                  female, with all the sprightliness and energy of purpose peculiar to a French
                  girl, when her interest is excited in some special object."</p>
               <p>"And this man, Mr. Craddock, what of him, sir? Has anything been heard of
                  him?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; Doctor Knight saw him in Paris, but did not make himself known; and Minette
                  writes in her last letter, received only a few weeks since, that he is still in
                  that city."</p>
               <p>"Has anything transpired, sir, that can furnish a clue to his motive in thys
                  persecuting Miss Thornton?" asked Gerald.</p>
               <p>"There it is," continued the vicar; "the letters from Armand are so ambiguous in
                  style. The writer evidently knows little or nothing about the matter himself;
                  indeed, he and the young woman both said as much to Dr. Knight, that one scarcely
                  known what steps to take. All we can be certain<pb n="318-319"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000160"/> is, that the poor young lady has suffered
                  persecution. I have no doubt some pecuniary matter is involved—and she is now, and
                  has been for some time past, immured in a convent, near Orleans. I have no doubt,"
                  continued the vicar, with a Protestant clergyman's holy horror, at the bare
                  thought, "that Mr. Craddock's purpose is, if she refuse to consent to some
                  arrangement or other, which we are all ignorant of, to compel her eventually to
                  take the veil. Minette, the waiting-woman, however, has given a slight inkling of
                  the cause of this persecution: She says that she thinks—she is not certain—but she
                  thinks, that Mr. Craddock, who is her uncle, as I informed you in my letter,
                  wishes to force her to consent to marry his son—her cousin."</p>
               <p>"But," said Gerald, "is there no possibility of taking immediate measures to
                  procure her release? Can it be possible that a young English girl can be lawfully
                  carried off and immured in a jail, for it is little better—nay, in some respects
                  much worse!"</p>
               <p>"I fear not," replied the vicar, "unless we have some good grounds for our
                  interference. You see this Mr. Craddock is her uncle, her only known relative
                  living, and Alice, yet wanting some months of her majority, he is in fact, her
                  natural guardian, so I have reason to believe the law would render it. By
                  interfering too rashly, we might fail in our object altogether."</p>
               <p>"Good heavens!" exclaimed Gerald, "Is there no clue that we can weave a plan of
                  action upon? Is the poor girl to remain subject to the tyranny of this man?"</p>
               <p>"I think there is, Gerald," continued the vicar, "but it will require time, and
                  involve considerable expense and trouble——"</p>
               <p>"I have sufficient money, sir," interrupted Gerald, "to serve me a year, and
                  trouble as regards this matter, I shall not heed; but time is the mischief—while
                  we are wasting time, this man may force Alice into his views; but, I beg your
                  pardon don—what is the clue to the cause of this infamous coercion, of which you
                  speak?"</p>
               <p>"It is this," replied the vicar, "I have observed that there is good reason to
                  believe that the object of the persecution is of a pecuniary nature. I don't see
                  what other motive Mr. Craddock could have in seeking to coerce his niece. Now,
                  listen; he took the young lady to Cuba, and there, according to the French
                  waiting-maid, endeavored to force her to we his son. Minette also says, thereby
                  corroborating the impression of Mr. Ashley, that Alice has told her more than
                  once, that her mother was a native of Cuba, though of English parentage. The
                  plantation upon which Mr. Craddock resided in Cuba, is said to be a very extensive
                  and valuable estate; putting these things together, I am led to the conclusion,
                  that the property, of right, belongs to Alice, and that by obtaining his niece's
                  consent to marry her cousin, Mr. Craddock hopes to bring the estate into his own
                  or at least into his son's possession. I can see no other motive for the
                  persecution, and I think the argument I have advanced is a plausible one."</p>
               <p>"I think so too, sir," said Gerald, eagerly; "but now to act in such a case, that
                  is the question. I will go myself to Cuba."</p>
               <p>"That is exactly what I was going to propose," said the vicar; "but you must see
                  your way clearly first. The Cuban government is a very jealous one; one
                  ill-advised step might spoil all. I have been speaking to Knight upon the subject,
                  and he agrees with me that some one interested in the young lady ought to go to
                  Cuba, and probe the subject to the bottom; but Mr. Craddock must remain in
                  ignorance of any such action having been taken. You are the best person to go; but
                  you will require letters of introduction and vouchers of respectability. Now
                  Knight is acquainted with one of the members of a Spanish mercantile firm in
                  Liverpool, and the house has a branch at Havana. He can procure you letters from
                  his friend to the partners in Cuba, and they will advise you how to act when you
                  arrive there. I believe that there is a will leaving<pb n="320-321"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000161"/> this property to Alice from one of her maternal
                  relatives, and that her uncle has unlawfully obtained possession of it, with the
                  object of accomplishing certain ends of his own. I am not sure that this is the
                  case; but you will allow that circumstances point that way."</p>
               <p>"Undoubtedly," eagerly replied Gerald, jumping at once to the conclusion he had
                  arrived at in his usual sanguine manner.</p>
               <p>The vicar smiled at the young man's impetuosity:</p>
               <p>"Don't be too sanguine, Gerald," he said, "we may be all wrong; but to-morrow
                  morning we will see Dr. Knight together, and arrange the matter, I trust,
                  satisfactorily."</p>
               <p>The conversation then took another turn and Gerald spoke of his mother, and of the
                  remorse he had felt and still continued to feel at his wilful, obstinate
                  conduct.</p>
               <p>Whatever Mr. Pearce might have thought, he "forbore to chide," rather endeavoring
                  to console the young man, by speaking of the consolation Mrs. Dalton experienced
                  in her dying hour, from the letter which had so opportunely arrived.</p>
               <p>This was touching a tender chord in Gerald's breast. It brought to his
                  recollection the singular vision he had seen, and he related the circumstances to
                  the vicar.</p>
               <p>"It was indeed strange," said the latter, when he had heard the story. "I have,
                  however, heard of such things, though it is impossible to explain them
                  satisfactorily. It would seem to be conclusive that there is a subtle magnetic
                  attraction by which we are sometimes enabled to hold spiritual communion together,
                  altogether independent, of the body; but these things are beyond our feeble
                  comprehension; perhaps, after all, it was but a dream, although the coincidence
                  was singular. Are you going down to Abbottsford.?"</p>
               <p>"Not now," replied the young man. "The visit would unnerve me, and render me unfit
                  for the task I have to perform. I must visit the grave of my mother alone, with my
                  mind free from any other anxiety. When I return from Cuba, I shall go thither and
                  render the last service to her memory which I have hitherto been unable to
                  perform. But it is growing very late, and I am keeping you up beyond your unusual
                  hour of retiring. I will now wish you good night, and to-morrow I will see you
                  again."</p>
               <p>"Why not remain here to-night? I have a spare bed at your service."</p>
               <p>"I thank you," replied Gerald, "but my luggage is at the King's Arms, and as you
                  perceive, I have not yet made any alteration in my attire, I was so anxious to see
                  you. I had better return in the inn to-night."</p>
               <p>"As you please," replied the vicar. "If you are resolved to go, good night."</p>
               <p>"By the by," said Gerald, as he took his hat from the table near him. "I had
                  almost forgotten to inquire after my old friend Jemmy Milton. I hope the old man
                  is well."</p>
               <p>"Quite well, only that he is beginning to feel the infirmities of age. By the way,
                  I have some news to tell you in relation to old Jemmy. The deacon, his brother is
                  dead, and the old man has come into possession of his property. There is something
                  too, having relation to you, which will surprise you when you hear it, but I shall
                  defer the explanation till to-morrow. Again, good night."</p>
               <p>"Good night, Sir," returned Gerald, as he quitted the room. A few minutes walk
                  carried him to the hotel, and fatigued with the travel toil of the day, and the
                  excitement he had passes through, he retired to his chamber and was soon
                  asleep.</p>
               <p>The next day he repeated his visit to the vicarage, and met Dr. Knight there,
                  according to appointment. Armand's letters were read and re-read, and the doctor
                  repeated the conversation he had held with the young Frenchman and Minette.
                  Comparing one with the other, there remained little doubt in the mind of any one
                  of the party that the surmise of the vicar would prove to be correct, and it was
                  decided that Gerald should sail immediately for the West Indies. The young man<pb
                     n="322-323" xml:id="VAC7199-00000162"/> wished to visit Paris and see Armand
                  and Minette himself, but he was overruled by his friends, who feared that
                  something might occur to excite the suspicions of Mr. Craddock, who might learn by
                  some means that he was in Paris, and take measures to defeat his object.</p>
               <p>Dr. Knight promised to procure the letters of introduction that had been alluded
                  to the night before, and wrote immediately to Liverpool with that object. Gerald
                  dined at the vicarage with Mr. Pearce and the Doctor, and after dinner set out to
                  pay a visit to Jemmy Milton, whose generosity towards himself he had heard during
                  dinner. He found the old man, as he had expected, seated in the boathouse. He
                  looked as hale and hearty as ever, smoking his pipe and gazing upon the sea dotted
                  with vessels of every description, passing through the narrow channel. Jemmy was
                  overjoyed to see his favorite once more.</p>
               <p>"Gerald," he said, after the first warm salutations were over, this here does my
                  old eyes good. I never expected to see you again on this yarth. I'm near up to the
                  full three score and ten, and shall soon be into the period when the days is 'full
                  of trouble and sorrow;' but I'm passin' away comfortable, and my blessin's is more
                  than I desarve. The old hulk lives on while the young is taken off. Your mother,
                  Gerald, was considerable younger than me, and it was only reasonable to expect
                  that my glass 'ud run down after her'n; but Providence has willed it otherwise,
                  and nobody has anyright to complain; bit I was mortal sorry to hear on the good
                  lady's death. Times has changed, Gerald since you left home. You've heerd, I
                  s'pose, as I've come into the deacon's money?"</p>
               <p>"Yes,' replied Gerald, "Mr. Pearce told me to-day, and he also informed me of your
                  intended generosity towards me; but I cannot consent to accept it, Jemmy. It would
                  not be right."</p>
               <p>"Why not?" said the old man. "I've n'ary chick nor child to leave it to, and the
                  vicar tells me how news has been heerd of Miss Alice, poor little thing! You'll
                  want money, Gerald, when you and she comes together. I won't hear a word agin the
                  legacy, as they calls it. It's my business, and nobody has a right to gainsay me.
                  But you'll be a goin' arter Alice, Gerald, and mayhap a little matter o' money 'ud
                  be sarviceable now; say the word, lad, and it's your'n at any time. I ain't no use
                  for't, and Jemmy Milton ain't the man to keep his friends a waitin' for dead men's
                  shoes."</p>
               <p>"I thank you sincerely, Jemmy," replied Gerald, "but I have money enough at
                  present for my purposes. I am going to sail shortly for Cuba, where I hope to be
                  able to clear up the mystery that has so long surrounded this strange affair. I
                  trust I shall succeed, and that ere long Alice and I may together thank you for
                  the interest you have ever expressed in our behalf."</p>
               <p>"But the legacy, Gerald," said the old man, earnestly; if you won't deny an old
                  man's wish, and refuse the rhino when I'm dead and gone?"</p>
               <p>"I should be foolish to do so, if you so much desire it, and have no nearer and
                  dearer friend to whom to leave it," said Gerald. "If I am satisfied such is the
                  case," he added, smiling, "I shan't object; but I hope it will be many years
                  before I am called upon to accept it."</p>
               <p>"That's spoken like yourself Gerald. You've eased my mind of a load, boy. I'd have
                  been shocking cut up if you'd have continued to refuse. As to living very many
                  years, it can't be expected in the course of natur. Howsumever, my health is
                  tolerable good yet, and I should like to live long enough to see you and Miss
                  Alice spliced, and then I shall feel ready to slip my cable at any moment that the
                  word's passed from aloft."</p>
               <p>Gerald remained until late conversing with the old man, and then, after walking
                  with him to his lodgings, returned to the inn.</p>
               <p>In the course of a few days, Dr. Knight received letters from<pb n="324-325"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000163"/> Liverpool, offering to assist him in any possible
                  way, and Gerald started for Liverpool, where he received letters of introduction
                  to the house of Hornby &amp; Co. of Havana, the firm being requested there in to
                  assist him to the extent of their capability. Within a week, he was on his way to
                  Cuba.</p>
               <p>The passage was a short and favorable one, and on his arrival at Havana, he called
                  immediately upon the Messrs. Hornby; and presented his letters.</p>
               <p>"I recollect something of this matter," said the senior partner of the firm, when,
                  after he had read the letters of introduction, Gerald explained the object of his
                  voyage. "It created at the time some little excitement and suspicion, the
                  departure of Mr. Craddock was so sudden and unexpected, and during is stay here,
                  the young lady, his niece, was kept in such seclusion; that is to say, she was not
                  permitted to make the acquaintance of any of the European or American ladies
                  residing here. But if it be as you suspect, we shall need to act with
                  caution."</p>
               <p>"What would you advise?" said Gerald.</p>
               <p>"I would insert a cautiously worded advertisement in the Gazette, stating that an
                  interview is requested with the late executor of the Craddock estates; I don't
                  know who the man is; but the property, I know, has been for some years in
                  litigation, and the case was at last decided in favor of Craddock. What was the
                  tenor of the will, I never heard."</p>
               <p>"And if I by this means discover the executor?"</p>
               <p>"Then I would state the case clearly to him, explaining the method employed to
                  abduct the young lady, and the suspicious to which this conduct has given rise,
                  and I would demand a sight of the will. You had better assume a lofty,
                  authoritative tone; it will serve you here. And before you take any steps in the
                  matter, I will introduce you to some of the high officials of the government, with
                  whom I am acquainted. Should you afterwards discover the person you seek, I will
                  get one of these gentleman to accompany you to his residence. Do you speak
                  Spanish?"</p>
               <p>"No." replied the young man.</p>
               <p>"Then I will also accompany you in the capacity of interpreter; but we are
                  reckoning without our host. We must first lay the train properly. Dine with me
                  to-night, the intendant will be at my house. I will manage to introduce the
                  subject, and get matters into a proper shape, and to-morrow insert the
                  advertisement."</p>
               <p>Gerald accepted the invitation, and thanking the merchant for his kindness, left
                  the office, and set out for a stroll through the city.</p>
               <p>In the evening, he met the intendant and one or two other officers, at the
                  residence of the merchant, and after dinner, Mr. Hornby introduced the subject,
                  and so managed to interest his Cuban friends, that they consented, for a
                  consideration, as was pretty broadly hinted, to assist the young man in his
                  endeavors, if their assistance should be required.</p>
               <p>The next day a notice appeared in the Havana <title>Gazette,</title> calling for
                  information respecting the executor of the estate of the late William Craddock,
                  Esq., of Regla, and in the event of that gentleman's being still in Cuba, asking
                  for an interview, which would result to his advantage.</p>
               <p>A reply was inserted in the same journal in a few days, stating that the gentleman
                  in question, Senor Alvero, was residing on a plantation, near St. Eugenio, and
                  that he would be in the city of Havana at the commencement of the ensuing week,
                  when he would grant the interview demanded.</p>
               <p>Thus far, all worked well, and Gerald waited with impatience for the day that
                  would bring about the promised interview.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The interview with the executor, showing how he fell into the snare laid for
                     him, and how Mr. Craddock consented to the release of his niece from the
                     convent—He returns to England.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE interview with Senor was greatly surprised when he discovered the object for
                  which he had been summoned; perhaps he had received a <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >douceur</foreign> from Mr. Craddock; perhaps he had made a trifle on his own
                  private account by pandering to that gentleman's desires. At all events, it was
                  very evident that he expected he had been sought for for a very different purpose;
                  but the trap had been laid so adroitly, that before he discovered it, he had
                  involved himself beyond possibility of retraction.</p>
               <p>On notifying his arrival at Havana to Mr. Hornby, by whom the advertisement had
                  been signed, he was asked to meet a party at dinner, at that gentleman's house.
                  The subject of the late Craddock litigation was introduced, in the presence of
                  three or four of the city authorities, the conversation being in Spanish, in order
                  that they might bear a part.</p>
               <p>"It is a fine estate, that of the Craddock's, at Regla," observed Mr. Hornby, to
                  one of the Spanish officers.</p>
               <p>"Yes," returned the person addressed, who had been schooled in the affair on hand,
                  "you were the executor, I believe," addressing Senor Alvero.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," replied the Senor.</p>
               <p>"It was decided in favor of the Craddocks, after a long course of litigation, I
                  believe," continued his interlocutor.</p>
               <p>"Yes," again replied Senor Alvero.</p>
               <p>"And the grand-daughter of the old gentleman comes into the entire property, if
                  she can be found, I understand?" said Mr. Hornby.</p>
               <p>"Yes, if she can be found," replied Senor Alvero; "but otherwise it goes to a
                  grandson, who is now, I understand, a student, in Kingston, Jamaica."</p>
               <p>"I wonder who that young lady was that old Mr. Craddock's son brought here a few
                  months since? She was very beautiful, I have heard the senoritas say, although he
                  kept her secluded from the society of her own sex," said Mr. Hornby.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and then decamped with her so suddenly," observed the officer, who had
                  opened the conversation. "I have often thought she was his niece, the grandson of
                  the <foreign xml:lang="SPA">viejo.</foreign> Do you know, Senor Alvero?"</p>
               <p>The Senor by this time appeared to suspect that he was being led into some trap.
                  He returned an evasive answer, and the conversation took another turn, and towards
                  ten o'clock, the party separated, leaving Mr. Hornby, Gerald and Senor Alvero,
                  alone.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. Hornby speaking for Gerald, whose ignorance of the Spanish language
                  rendered him impotent to act on the occasion, seriously re-introduced the
                  subject.</p>
               <p>"You have promptly replied to the advertisement I caused to be inserted in the
                  Gazette, Senor Alvero," he said, "You were the executor of Mr. Craddock, and, of
                  course, are acquainted with the contents of the documents in question. Have you
                  any objection to state their nature as nearly as you can recollect? or, perhaps
                  you have the will in your possession?"</p>
               <p>"I have it no longer, I surrendered it to Mr. Craddock, the son of the testator,"
                  replied Senor Alvero.</p>
               <p>"But were you satisfied that he was the legatee?" inquired Mr. Hornby.</p>
               <p>"In case the grand daughter of the testator could not be discovered, his son was,"
                  replied Senor Alvero.</p>
               <pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC7199-00000165"/>
               <p>"But are you satisfied that proper and sufficient search has been made for the
                  rightful heir?" continued Mr. Hornby. "Do you know who the young lady was who was
                  lately in Cuba, residing on the Regla property with him, whom it was currently
                  reported, he wished his son—a fine young man, George Craddock—to marry. She might
                  be the heiress in question."</p>
               <p>"I know not why you are questioning me in this manner," said Senor Alvero, growing
                  angry. "The heiress could not be found; the son of Senor Craddock was the next
                  heir in succession; his father claimed the title, and I, in duty bound,
                  surrendered the will. Is this all that was required of me by the notice that
                  appeared in the Gazette?"</p>
               <p>"Not exactly all," said Mr. Hornby. "We demand the privilege of reading the will,
                  in Behalf of Miss Alice Craddock, the rightful heiress, whose present location we
                  know, and whom we can produce when the occasion demands it."</p>
               <p>"By what right do you dare to question me thus?" repeated Senor Alvero, in an
                  angry tone of voice. "I have told you that I have surrendered the will to Mr.
                  Craddock, by default, the rightful heir not appearing."</p>
               <p>"We have a right which you will soon acknowledge, Senor," replied Mr. Hornby. "And
                  you had no right to surrender your executorship over the estate of Mr. Craddock,
                  as we can prove, if you force us so to do; but, it will be to your advantage to
                  act honestly."</p>
               <p>"You threaten me," returned Senor Alvero. "I shall not reply."</p>
               <p>"Senor," said Mr. Hornby; "let us understand each other—you recollect that you
                  confessed to-night, in the presence of more than one officer of the Government,
                  that Miss Alice Thornton was the rightful heiress to the estates you now confess
                  to have surrendered to Mr. Craddock, her uncle. We have your own word for this;
                  reflect, in what an unfortunate position you will be placed, if we are compelled
                  again to resort to law, which we shall assuredly do, if we cannot otherwise obtain
                  satisfaction?"</p>
               <p>Senor Alvero remained silent, and Mr. Hornby continued: "We mean you no harm,
                  Senor Alvero; you have doubtless been the dupe of Mr. Craddock. It is your duty
                  now to expose the fraud of which I have no doubt he has been guilty. Your honesty
                  shall be rewarded, and all that is passed shall be forgotten, so far as it
                  concerns you. If you still persist in your present position, we shall hold you
                  guilty, and the result will be your own fault."</p>
               <p>Senor Alvero began to perceive that his deception had been brought to light by
                  some means unknown to him. The fact that he was in the dark in this respect
                  increased his alarm—and he recollected that he had laid himself open to the
                  authorities by his incautious remarks. Again, he had shrewdness enough to perceive
                  that no harm was intended him, if he changed his tactics and supported the right
                  cause, and, after a pause of some duration, he confessed that he had, he believed,
                  been <emph>misled</emph> by Mr. Craddock's representations, and that he believed
                  that gentleman had sinister motives in concealing the existence of Alice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hornby now related what he had heard from Gerald concerning Alice Thornton,
                  and said that she was in France, and could and would be produced to make her claim
                  good to the property; "and now," he added, in conclusion, "we perfectly understand
                  each other. You have not given up the original will? produce it, and you shall
                  find it to your interest in the end."</p>
               <p>Senor Alvero confessed that he had surrendered only a copy of the will to Mr.
                  Craddock, taking credit to himself for retaining the original, in the belief that
                  Mr. Craddock was deceiving him although he observed, he made so good a claim in
                  behalf of his son, that he felt himself justified in acting as he had done.</p>
               <p>"Then the original will we shall see to-morrow," said Mr. Hornby.</p>
               <p>"Not to-morrow, it is impossible. It is in my strong box, at home, at St. Eugenio;
                  but I will send for it and produce it in the course of a few days."</p>
               <pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC7199-00000166"/>
               <p>"Be it so, then," said Mr. Hornby. "Recollect," he added, in a stern tone of
                  voice, "we understand each other, and I shall allow of no further subterfuge."</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="SPA">De muy buena gana,</foreign>" (with all my
                  heart,)returned Senor Alvero, as bidding his host good night, he prepared to
                  return to his hotel.</p>
               <p>"We have managed this affair skilfully, Mr. Dalton," said Mr. Hornby, when Senor
                  Alvero had departed. "I have no doubt whatever, that this fellow has been
                  perfectly cognizant all throughout of a fraud having been perpetrated in this
                  case; but it is as well to humor him, and profess ignorance, while, at the same
                  time we hold a proper check over him. However, I congratulate you upon your
                  success, and have no doubt that you will perfectly succeed in your
                  undertaking."</p>
               <p>Senor Alvero knew that he was watched by the police, and on the appointed day he
                  was faithful to his word. The original will arrived from St. Eugenio, and was
                  produced and read by Gerald and Mr. Hornby. The fraudulent intentions of Mr.
                  Craddock were at once made manifest. He had stated the contents falsely to Alice.
                  The estates of the late Mr. Craddock were left to her as the sole heiress, only in
                  case of her death to descend to the heirs of Mr. Craddock. Knowing that she was
                  living, he had endeavored to promote a marriage with his son, in order that the
                  ownership of the property might devolve upon himself, or his own family.</p>
               <p>Gerald demanded and obtained a fair copy of the will, legally executed and
                  properly attested in court, and armed, as he was, with full power to overthrow the
                  falsehood and wrong perpetrated by Mr. Craddock, lost no time in returning to
                  England.</p>
               <p>He learnt from Mr. Pearce, on arriving at Herrington, that another letter had been
                  received from Armand. Minette had made the cause of Alice her own; and what will
                  an intriguing French woman not accomplish, when her heart is set upon gaining some
                  end? By some means or other, Minetto had managed to obtain a knowledge of all that
                  was passing in the convent at Orleans, and had set Armand to track Mr. Craddock's
                  every movement in Paris. He had written, to inform Mr. Pearce, that Ma'mselle
                  Alice's term of probation had nearly expired, and that Minette feared, that unless
                  relief were afforded, she would soon be compelled to take the veil, and be forever
                  secluded in the convent. The original three months test promised by Mr. Craddock
                  had been long extended, but his patience appeared to be wearied at last, and he,
                  himself, was intending to leave Paris for Havana, in the course of a few
                  weeks.</p>
               <p>There was no time to be lost. The letter had already been a week in the possession
                  of the vicar, and yet there existed much difficulty in managing the affair.</p>
               <p>A bold course was the only one to pursue, and Gerald, accompanied by Doctor
                  Knight, immediately set out for the French capital, resolved to seek out Armand,
                  and from him discover where Mr. Craddock was to be found, and confronting him, to
                  boldly prove his falsehood, and demand from him, as the only price of secrecy, the
                  instant release of Alice, and the restoration of her rights.</p>
               <p>Gerald had Armand's address in the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Quartier St.
                     Antoine,</foreign> and the young man was soon found, seated at his easel,
                  busily occupied studio(which comprised bedroom and parlor, and all)in neat
                  array.</p>
               <p>She blushed and withdrew when the strangers entered, and Armand explained that
                  though, as yet, she was not his wife, she was good enough to come every day and
                  perform the same kind office. He expressed a perfect willingness to show his
                  visitors where Mr. Craddock could be found, and, in reply to an expression of
                  curiosity on the part of Dr. Knight, how Minette could obtain such correct
                  information regarding what occurred in the seclusion of the convent, he shrugged
                  his shoulders, and replied—"Ma <foreign xml:lang="FRA">foi!</foreign> Nothing is
                  impossible to a woman. She has made friends with the porteress and obtains<pb
                     n="332-333" xml:id="VAC7199-00000167"/> it from her; but now, I cannot say. She
                  keeps her plans secret from me, except when she dictates what I shall write;
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Mais diable! Messieurs,</foreign> I wish this matter
                  were settled satisfactorily, for, until it is, the little <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >conquine</foreign> swears she will not marry me."</p>
               <p>Mr. Craddock resided at an hotel in the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Rue
                     Richelieu,</foreign> and thither guided by Armand, the travellers proceeded,
                  and requested the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">commissionaire</foreign> to direct them
                  to his rooms, and to announce the arrival of two gentleman from England.</p>
               <p>They were readily admitted, although Mr. Craddock's countenance expressed
                  considerable disgust and suspicion. However, he requested them to be seated, and
                  asked the nature of their business with him.</p>
               <p>"My name is Gerald Dalton," said Gerald, frankly, "and we have called to make
                  inquiries respecting Alice Thornton."</p>
               <p>"And pray, young sir," said Mr. Craddock. "What is your business with Miss
                  Thornton, or if you have business with her, what reason have you to imagine that I
                  know where she may be?"</p>
               <p>The cool effrontery of this reply, temporarily disconcerted the young man, while
                  Dr. Knight listened with perfect astonishment; but Gerald quickly recovered
                  himself, and replied:</p>
               <p>"This gentleman and I, and others in England and elsewhere, have ample evidence to
                  prove that you abducted the young lady from England, and have since retained her
                  almost a close prisoner."</p>
               <p>"And if I have," said Mr. Craddock, "who dares gain <emph>say</emph> my right to
                  do so? Am I not her uncle; her only living relative, with the exception of my son,
                  her cousin, and, consequently, her natural guardian?"</p>
               <p>"I do not know," replied Gerald, "that the fact of your being her uncle, gives you
                  the right to take her forciby from the guardian to whose care she was entrusted by
                  her father on his death bed, or from those to whom he transferred his guardianship
                  when about to leave England. It is for the law to settle that, and also to test
                  your right to property which belongs to her, by her grandfather's will."</p>
               <p>"Ha!" exclaimed Mr. Craddock, "you are bold, young sir; pray, what do you know of
                  a will, and who gave you or your friends the right to pry into matters that do not
                  concern you?"</p>
               <p>"We shall see," returned Gerald, making a preconcerted signal for Armand to
                  enter.</p>
               <p>"Who is this fellow that is engaged with you in this trumped-up conspiracy to
                  obtain money from me, no doubt?" said Mr. Craddock, sarcastically, glancing
                  contemptuously at the paint-soiled blouse and untrimmed beard of the artist.</p>
               <p>"I will shortly explain, Monsieur," replied Armand, exasperated at this taunt.
                  "Monsieur recollects, perhaps, Ma'mselle Minette, who was waiting-maid to Miss
                  Alice, in Cuba. She was curtly and rudely dismissed from the service of Madame
                  Alice, by Monsieur, on his return to Paris, when Madame was sent to be immured in
                  a convent. Ha! Ma'mselle Minette swore revenge—and a French <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">soubrette</foreign> knows how to obtain it. I have letters here
                  to prove all I have asserted."</p>
               <p>Excited to passion that he could no longer control, Mr. Craddock rose from his
                  seat and was about to rush upon Armand, and expel him from the room, when he was
                  interrupted by Gerald, who said:</p>
               <p>"Calm yourself and control your temper, Mr. Craddock, you are the uncle of Alice,
                  and for her sake no harm shall befal you, if you will render her the justice that
                  is due. Nay, do not threaten——" (Mr. Craddock had commenced to reply, in a
                  blustering, threatening tone.) "There is a certain will in the custody of Senor
                  Alvero of Havana, the executor of the estate of the late Mr. Craddock—of which I
                  have in my possession a faithful copy, sworn to and attested in the Cuban
                  Courts—which has been wrongfully taken possession of by you and of which you have
                  made a fraudulent use. I have just returned from Havana, whither I went with the
                  express object of discovering the frauds that I and others learnt through
                     Alice's<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC7199-00000168"/> waiting maid, Minette, and
                  this young man, had been practiced upon the young lady, by you, her
                  self-constituted guardian. I have learnt that which would consign you to prison
                  for life; but release Alice from the Convent, and forego your unjust claims, and,
                  for her sake, I will be forever silent on this subject."</p>
               <p>Mr. Craddock had changed color several times while Gerald was speaking, with
                  mingled rage and fear; but, he felt that the young man was speaking the truth in
                  regard to the investigations he had made, and he knew that he had been guilty of a
                  heinous crime. He calmed his passion and said:</p>
               <p>"I confess that I have done wrong; but my original object was no benefit my niece,
                  but the Vengeance of Providence has overtaken me. I was about to return to Cuba. I
                  shall now go to India. I will send to the Superior of the convent and give orders
                  for the release of Alice, and shall then quit the country never to return."</p>
               <p>"That is all that I ask," replied Gerald; but Dr. Knight, who had not yet spoken,
                  now interposed.</p>
               <p>"This must be done immediately, or we shall take other measures—"</p>
               <p>"I will write now," said Mr. Craddock, thoroughly subdued, and in the presence of
                  his visitors he wrote the letter, giving it to them unsealed.</p>
               <p>"That is sufficient," said Gerald, after reading it. "Mr. Craddock, I wish you
                  good day," and accompanied by the young Frenchman, the doctor and Gerald quitted
                  the hotel, and that evening set out for Orleans, where the letter was presented at
                  the convent, and within an hour Alice Thornton was freed from her restraint and
                  heartily congratulated by Dr. Knight and Gerald.</p>
               <p>The poor girl, who had so long considered her escape hopeless, was overpowered
                  with joy and gratitude. As soon as the first transports of her delight were over,
                  she inquired after her former friends, Mrs. Dalton, the Ashley's, and the vicar,
                  nor was old Jemmy Milton forgotten. She was deeply affected on hearing from Gerald
                  of the death of his mother; but her joy at escaping from the convent was so great,
                  that she soon dried the tears she shed on hearing of the decease of her second
                  mother, as she styled Mrs. Dalton.</p>
               <p>She had a thousand questions to ask and a thousand to reply to, and the relation
                  of all that had fallen each since they had bid each other farewell in Herrington,
                  was matter for conversation until they landed at Dover, to which place they
                  travelled with all possible rapidity and there hiring a carriage found themselves
                  in the course of two hours at the entrance to the vicarage of Herrington.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>In which the reader is conducted over a good deal of ground, and in which Love,
                     Courtship and Matrimony are all introduced. Some readers may think better late
                     than never.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE newly arrived party were warmly welcomed by the vicar who had seen the chaise
                  coming up the lane which led to the vicarage. Alice, especially, although he
                  declared that he could scarcely recognize her as the same little Alice whom he had
                  so often met on the beach or on the path which led along the cliffs, was
                  congratulated upon her happy return and on the good fortune that awaited her in
                  Cuba. "Although," said the vicar with a sly smile, for the good man liked a joke
                  now and then, "I shouldn't wonder if you are looking forward with greater pleasure
                  to the consummation of a still greater happiness, eh, Gerald?" addressing the
                  young man, "What do you think?"</p>
               <p>Gerald smiled and looked fondly at Alice, and Alice cast down her eyes, almost
                  shrouding them beneath their long dark fringes, and blushed, and so replied to the
                  vicar's query in the most satisfactory manner.</p>
               <p>A few days were passed pleasantly enough in visiting old friends in Herrington
                  Jemmy Milton, to be sure, not being forgotten. The old man was rejoiced to see her
                  again, and made her sit down in the boathouse and recount to him all that had
                  happened to her since her abrupt departure from Herrington.</p>
               <p>"It does me good," he said, "to hear your sweet voice again, Miss Alice. It is a
                  cheersome sound to my old ears. It is like the south wind blowing softly through a
                  ship's cordage after a blustering nor'wester, and wafting the good ship homeward,
                  and recalling to mind the memory of those we left behind hind us, and who we hope
                  are waiting to welcome our return. So your voice, Miss Alice, minds me of old
                  times when you and Gerald were boy and girl, and I was not so old and stiff as I
                  have become during the year or two past."</p>
               <p>The old man, too, hazarded his jokes upon the future union of the young couple. He
                  insisted upon purchasing a valuable necklace for Alice, which he made her promise
                  to wear on the day of her wedding, which he very shrewdly took for a settled
                  affair, and would have insisted upon Alice's being measured at a jeweller's for a
                  wedding ring, only Gerald, to whom he communicated his intentions, managed after
                  much difficulty to persuade him that that would not be exactly the thing.</p>
               <p>They were very happy wandering together over the cliffs, or on the beach, Alice
                  and Gerald; but the latter felt that he had duties to perform, and he was at last
                  fain to leave her for a time to the care of the vicar, while he paid a visit to
                  Abbottsford and to London.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pearce and he had held several private conversations together. On one of these
                  occasions, he had informed the vicar that he had obtained Alice's consent to their
                  speedy union, and the conversation had turned upon their future prospects.</p>
               <p>"It is my intention to reside in the United States," said Gerald, in reply to a
                  question put to him by the vicar. "I have intimated this to Alice, and she is
                  willing to go with me thither; and it will be necessary that we both go to Cuba
                  and arrange matters relating to the property belonging to her on that island."</p>
               <p>"You are doubly fortunate, Gerald," replied the vicar, "in finding Alice to be an
                  heiress."</p>
               <p>"I suppose I am," said Gerald. "Indeed, it would be folly for me to pretend
                  otherwise; but, although I still feel a delicacy with respect to that legacy of
                  Jemmy Milton's, I should have felt unpleasantly in marrying Alice, poor as I would
                  otherwise be."</p>
               <pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC7199-00000170"/>
               <p>"That would be false delicacy, my young friend," replied the vicar, "if you each
                  other. You have health and strength, and the ability to earn your own living;
                  besides, you intend to go to America. It is not improbable that the estate I have
                  heard your mother speak of may be of value."</p>
               <p>"A mere chimera, I fear," replied Gerald. "I have heard something about it through
                  a letter I received in India from my poor mother; but I could not properly
                  understand the subject. However, I shall of course make proper inquiry when I
                  reach the United States."</p>
               <p>"You say you are going to set out for Abbottsford the day after to-morrow?"</p>
               <p>"Yes sir, and I shall visit London and see Mr. Hoffmann before I return to
                  Abbottsford."</p>
               <p>"Of course Alice will remain here with me the while?"</p>
               <p>"I was going to propose that, sir," said Gerald. "I thank you for the offer. Alice
                  is like a sister to me now. She has no other protector, and yet I could not well
                  have taken her to Abbottsford; besides, I wish to go there alone."</p>
               <p>On the day mentioned, the young man bade Alice a temporary good-by, and set out
                  for the village in Northamptonshire where his mother had died. Notwithstanding the
                  happy prospects that wee now opened to him, the young man felt sad and melancholy
                  during the progress of this journey. He recalled to mind the last time he had
                  travelled over that road—then he was accompanying his mother to her new abode—and
                  how many times since, aye, even when in India, he had made up his mind to remain
                  for some time abroad, he had pictured to himself the time when he should return
                  and pass along that same road with a buoyant heart, eager to meet her again. He
                  had never though that the next time he travelled that road, it would be to visit
                  his mother's grave.</p>
               <p>The little quiet village was reached after two day's travel, and when he alighted
                  at the "ride-away," as the lane was called which led to the village, for
                  Abbottsford did not stand on the high road, he recalled the vivid impression of
                  his dream, when he had in fancy passed along this lane listening to the tolling of
                  the village church bell which announced his mother's death, and her funeral. But
                  the bell was not tolling now, although, as in the dream, the leaves were green
                  upon the trees, and the sunbeams were shining brightly on the green sward, and the
                  cattle were lazily reposing in the shade, and the birds were warbling sweetly
                  amidst the branches and in the hedgerows.</p>
               <p>In half an hour's walk he had reached the parsonage, where he intended to call and
                  introduce himself to Mr. Davis, the rector.</p>
               <p>He found that gentleman at home, and on hearing the errand upon which the young
                  man had come, the clergyman kindly welcomed him to the village.</p>
               <p>Refreshments were placed before him, and after he had partaken of them, the rector
                  related to him many circumstances attending his mother's death.</p>
               <p>"She was very anxious about you for a long time before her last illness," said the
                  clergyman, "and looked eagerly for a letter by every mil that arrived from India.
                  I shall never forget the look of anxiety she gave me when I entered her chamber
                  bearing with me the letter I had but a few moments before received, nor the
                  eagerness with which she stretched out her wasted hand to receive the prize. She
                  was too feeble to read it; her eye-sight had already failed her; but, I read the
                  letter aloud, close to her ear, and her countenance changed to an expression so
                  happy, so thankful, that health appeared suddenly to have been restored t her; but
                  she soon relapsed into a state of unconsciousness from which she never perfectly
                  revived, although the happy expression rested upon her features to the last. She
                  held the letter I had given into her hand after reading it, closely clasped to her
                  bosom—and I have no doubt, her last earthly thoughts were of you. Only a few
                  moments before her death, rousing herself as if from a stupor,<pb n="340-341"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000171"/> she asked me to kneel and pray—to let her hear me
                  pray for you—she wished to die, she feebly whispered while that prayer was passing
                  from my lips, and so she died. She spoke but once again and these last words were,
                  "Remember, Gerald, remember!" The right hand was outstretched and the finger
                  pointed as if in warning, and so it remained, stiffened in death, after the breath
                  had passed from her. It was with difficulty we could relax its rigidity; the
                  letter she clasped so closely to her bosom, we buried with her. She was followed
                  to the grave by a great number of the villagers and all the school children, and
                  deeply and sincerely lamented by all who had known her. What little property she
                  died possessed of I hold in trust for you. I wrote to Mr. Pearce, stating many of
                  these facts, and, I presume, you have heard them from him; but, I thought it would
                  be a mournful gratification to you to listen to them from the lips of one who
                  watched her last moments, and closed her eyes in death."</p>
               <p>Gerald was much affected during this recital; and Mr. Davis perceiving his
                  emotion, remained for some time silent. At length he inquired whether he should
                  conduct the young man to the secluded spot in the church-yard where his mother's
                  grave was situated; "A simple mound of turf marks the spot," he added, "I would
                  gladly have erected a tomb-stone at the head of the grave, but I thought it better
                  to leave that mournful duty to you, for I anticipated your speedy return, when you
                  should hear the sad intelligence."</p>
               <p>"If you will describe the spot to me, I will thank you," replied Gerald; "but I
                  would rather visit the grave alone."</p>
               <p>"You can see the spot but not the mound itself, from my study window," said the
                  rector, rising and advancing towards a low window which looked out upon a neat
                  lawn overspread with ornamental shrubs, and from which the church-yard could be
                  seen beyond; the group of horse-chestnuts with the tall, slender pointed spire,
                  peeping out above the dark green foliage forming a beautiful and a fitting
                  background to the prospect.</p>
               <p>"You see that clump of yew and cedars of Lebanon, there to the right, just beyond
                  where the chestnut trees grow thickest," said he, directing Gerald's attention to
                  the spot with his outstretched finger. "It is there beyond the largest yew. The
                  mound is right beneath its shade. you cannot mistake it, for it is the only grave
                  there. The spot was chosen by your mother on her death-bed. She was fond of
                  walking in the church-yard sometimes, and, there used to be a rustic seat there
                  where she would sit in the summer evenings and read. That is removed now and the
                  grave-mound marks the exact spot where it stood."</p>
               <p>Gerald thanked the clergyman, and saying he had no doubt he would readily find the
                  spot he was in search of, he took his hat and went on his melancholy quest.</p>
               <p>The grave was found with ease—and there seated on the green mound where his mother
                  had spent so many hours, he remained until twilight came on, and the rector
                  growing anxious in consequence of his non-appearance, went in search of him, and
                  invited him to return to the house.</p>
               <p>What were the young man's thoughts during these hours of meditation—perhaps, of
                  prayer, he never disclosed.</p>
               <p>He remained at Abbottsford a week—and, at the expiration of that period, a
                  tomb-stone that had been ordered the day after his arrival, from the neighboring
                  town, was brought to the village and planted above the lowly grave. It was a
                  tombstone neat and plain, as befitted the secluded country churchyard—and
                  fashioned out of the purest while marble that could be procured—fitting emblem as
                  the young man thought, of the virtues of her whose humble sepulchre it
                  adorned.</p>
               <p>It was a bright summer's morning when the tombstone was fixed at the head of the
                  grass-grown mound above the grave. Daisies and butter-cups and cowslips covered
                  the sod, and grew thickly around the spot, in whose petals yet glistened the
                  diamond drops of morning dew; and as Gerald gazed upon these flowers springing up
                  from the rich dank earth of the graveyard,<pb n="342-343"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000172"/> he thought they blossomed as a lively token to man,
                  that out of corruption shall spring immortality, and that death is but the portal
                  to a brighter and an eternal life.</p>
               <p>A single plain inscription was traced upon the smooth white surface of the marble.
                  It was this:— <q>
                     <p>"SACRED<lb/> TO<lb/> THE MEMORY<lb/> OF<lb/> MY MOTHER."</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The day following that on which the tombstone had been placed in its position,
                  Gerald bade farewell to the friendly rector, and took his departure for London,
                  where he visited the old well-remembered store in Broad Street Bloomsbury, and saw
                  Mr. Hoffmann. The old gentleman received him with kindness, and expressed regret
                  for the harshness of his conduct.</p>
               <p>The young man, at another time, might have received this acknowledgment with some
                  show of the pride and hauteur peculiar to his disposition; but he had just
                  returned from a scene calculated to chasten his spirit, and to subdue his pride
                  and obstinacy of character. He accepted the proffered hand of the really honest,
                  good-hearted old auctioneer, and expressed regret in his turn for the petulance of
                  his conduct and the flippant tone of the letters he had written announcing his
                  failure.</p>
               <p>"Well, well," said the old gentleman, "we were all wong—we all failed in some
                  degree in that patience and proper regard for the feelings of each other, which is
                  one of the chief duties of man. We were pack of old noodles too—I see it now—to
                  sent out such a pack of trumpery; and Gerald, I think you were a little hasty in
                  getting rid of it."</p>
               <p>"The loss you sustained, if ever I am able to do so, I will repay you, each and
                  all," said Gerald.</p>
               <p>"No, no," replied Mr. Hoffmann—"no need for that—no need for that, you suffered
                  loss, too; of course you did; and we were able to lose the money, though it
                  troubled us some at the time, but it didn't ruin us, Gerald—it didn't ruin us,"
                  and the old gentleman chuckled at the thought, probably, of the comfortable
                  condition of his finances; but Gerald insisted that if ever it should be in his
                  power, he would refund the money lost, and the old gentleman ended the dispute, by
                  money lost, and the old gentleman ended the dispute, by saying:—</p>
               <p>"Well, well—pay it, if you insist upon it; we shan't refuse the money, I dare say;
                  but don't consider it a debt until you are able to repay it. What, by the way, are
                  you going to do with yourself,?"</p>
               <p>"I am shortly going to the united States," replied the young man. "You know New
                  York is my native place, and I have resolved to visit it again, with the intention
                  of making it, or rather with making some part of the country, my future home. My
                  mother is dead," he added, in a saddened tone of voice, "and I have no particular
                  tie to bind me to England."</p>
               <p>"Aye," said the old gentleman, "I heard of your mother's death while you were
                  abroad, and though I was not acquainted with her, I was much grieved; but as you
                  are going abroad again, suppose we were to make up a venture?"</p>
               <p>"No, thank you," replied Gerald, laughing, "I should think you have had enough of
                  that—I have, at all events."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, dine with us to-day, and spend the evening; the old lady 'll find you
                  a spare bed somewhere."</p>
               <p>"I will accept your invitation to dinner," returned the young man, "but I cannot
                  remain during the evening; I have much yet to do in London, considering the time I
                  have to do it in, for I intend to set out, on my return to Herrington, to-morrow
                  night.'</p>
               <p>"As you please," replied Mr. Hoffmann. "If you feel it to be your duty, it is
                  quite right for you to refuse, and so manage your business as to be ready to
                  return home at the appointed time."</p>
               <p>Gerald dined with his former employer; and during that evening and the following
                  morning, transacted what business<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC7199-00000173"/> he
                  had to do, which was very little after all; and at eight o'clock in the evening
                  was seated in the stage, and on his way back to Herrington, and to Alice.</p>
               <p>Soon after his return there were evident signs of the approach of some grand
                  event. The quiet vicarage was almost turned inside out. Perhaps never had such
                  strange doings been enacted there before. Such bales of muslin, and parcels of
                  silk and satin, and such a passing to from the house of the tidy, smart-looking
                  dressmakers and milliners, and the housekeeper was so busy and assumed such an air
                  of importance, that people began to wonder what could be the matter at the
                  vicarage, and to imagine all kinds of strange and silly things. "The vicar is
                  going to marry his housekeeper, I'se warrant," said the old dames of the town over
                  their bohea. "Marry come up with her for a stuck ogling in church, and he a
                  clargy, too, and she an old maid, and as to good looks, I'd be ashamed if I warn't
                  no better lookin' nor she."</p>
               <p>And "Lawks no! he, he,! Becky Sanford good looking!" tittered a lot of old dames
                  in chorus, "I'd break all the lookin' glasses I came across if I were as ugly as
                  Becky Sandford."</p>
               <p>And so the news got abroad that the vicar was going to be married, and some
                  doubted and some believed, and some thought it was none of their business whether
                  he got married or not, and others though it was their business, any how.</p>
               <p>But all this anxiety was set at rest on the morning of the ensuing Sabbath, when
                  the Rev. Mr. Pearce publicly published the bans of marriage between Gerald Dalton
                  and Alice Thornton, both of Herrington, in the county of Kent, and on the third
                  Sunday morning from this, after morning service, a young man with pride and
                  satisfaction depicted in his face, albeit, a slight nervous tremor occasionally
                  betrayed the presence of some unwonted emotion, and a young lady clad in pure
                  white and fair herself as the white garments she wore, save where the roses
                  blushed in her cheeks, stood at the altar in Herrington church and were united by
                  the Rev. Mr. Pearce in the holy bonds of matrimony, and an old sailor stood near
                  with such delight expressed in his visage, that every moment a looker on might
                  have thought that he was about to give it some uproarious expression. The old
                  sailor gave away the bride and when the ceremony was over imprinted a fatherly
                  kiss on her fair cheek. The sailor was Jemmy Milton, and it was Gerald Dalton who
                  quitted the church a happy husband, but Alice Thornton returned no more. A fair
                  blushing girl of little more than twenty summers rested fondly upon the arm of the
                  young man; and it was Alice Thomton's features and expression that she wore, but
                  it was not she. It was Alice Dalton—Gerald's blooming bride.</p>
               <p>They set out for a brief tour through France on the following day, and while in
                  Paris visited Armand and Minette and found them happily married.</p>
               <p>The services these had rendered Alice were not forgotten. They had formerly been
                  rewarded; but now—Alice having succeeded in obtaining from the lawyer who had been
                  employed after her return to England to manage any intricacies that might
                  disarrange her affairs, permission to draw for what money she required—they were
                  made happy—quite rich—they thought, with a really generous present.</p>
               <p>After a two months's ramble, the young couple returned to England, and immediately
                  commenced preparations for the projected voyage to America.</p>
               <p>The island of Cuba was their first destination, Gerald and indeed Alice likewise
                  being anxious to have all matters connected with the Cuban estates properly
                  settled, and they were soon ready for the voyage.</p>
               <p>The vessel on board of which their passage was engaged was to sail from Liverpool,
                  and to that port they set out to join her, after let them know how they prospered
                  in the new World.</p>
               <p>Three months from the date of their marriage, Gerald and Alice were on their way
                  to the West Indies.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Which treats of various matters, showing how Gerald and Alice visited Cuba, and
                     arranged matters to their own satisfaction, and afterwards went to New York,
                     where Gerald met with some old acquaintances in name. How he visited Ohio, and
                     returned to New York, leaving matters in abeyance which the next and concluding
                     chapter will set to rights.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Minerva brig, on board which Gerald and his young wife had sailed for Havana,
                  arrived duly in port, after having made an ordinary passage out. letters had been
                  dispatched beforehand to announce their coming, and Mr. Hornby, whose friendship
                  had been so serviceable to Gerald on the occasion of his former visit, received
                  them at his house with true West Indian hospitality. They found no difficulty now
                  in proving old Mr. Craddock's will. Senor Alvero was all smiles and
                  obsequiousness, and Mr. Hornby was perfectly conversant with the method whereby
                  the Cuban authorities, who might have opposed the succession, or ar least caused a
                  great deal of trouble, and thrown obstacles in the way could be managed so as to
                  be led with the utmost docility, so the matter was easily settled with the
                  assistance of a few golden compliments, and Alice was put in possession of the
                  title deeds of the Craddock estates without any opposition being made, and as both
                  she and her husband were, of course, ignorant of the management of a West Indian
                  plantation, Senor Alvero who, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">labrone</foreign> as he was,
                  was quite as trustworthy as most of his class, was at Mr. Hornby's suggestion,
                  retained in the position of overseer, to which he had bee appointed by Mr
                  Craddock.</p>
               <p>Alice's cousin George, who was still in Jamaica, heard through the newspapers of
                  the arrival of Gerald and Alice at Havana, and also of the circumstances which had
                  induced to his cousin's return. He had been no party to his father's attempt at
                  fraud, having never entertained a doubt of the correctness of Mr. Craddock's
                  statements in relation to the clauses of the will; still he felt that something of
                  the obloquy, necessarily, though undeservedly, rested upon him, and he resolved to
                  visit his cousin at Regla and wipe off any stain that, in the opinion of her
                  husband, might rest upon his character, by asking from his cousin's own lips an
                  explanation of his conduct during her former sojourn on the estate.</p>
               <p>He arrived at Regla about a month after Gerald and his wife had landed at Havana,
                  and was kindly received by them. Alice, in fact, had told her husband of his
                  generous behavior, and his fears that his conduct might be misinterpreted were
                  unfounded, Gerald was not only ready but eager to give him a cordial reception and
                  a generous welcome, and he was pressed to take up his abode with them while he
                  remained.</p>
               <p>"I will gladly do so," he replied, "but my stay will be but short. I received a
                  letter from my father written in Paris, about a fortnight since, requesting me to
                  go to the United States, and thence take passage to India. He will meet me there,
                  having long before this sailed for Calcutta. My father made no allusion whatever
                  to his niece, nor did he say why he was not again coming to the West Indies; but
                  in order to induce me the more promptly to accede to his wishes, he hinted that as
                  I had formerly mentioned to him that I had an "attachment" in Jamaica, I had his
                  consent to marry the young lady and carry her with me to Calcutta. I couldn't
                  understand the cause of this sudden alteration in his views, until I read the
                  newspaper gossip in relation to these Cuban plantations. I was exceedingly
                  mortified, and you will acknowledge with good reason, the more especially as the
                  old commissary General, the father of my <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                  >fiance</foreign>—for I have been pushing matters hard since my return from Cuba,
                  and have obtained the<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC7199-00000175"/> young lady's
                  promise to marry me—read the story in the papers, and demanded an explanation, and
                  the young lady herself refused to see me.</p>
               <p>"I told the old gentleman the whole story, and he was so pleased with my candor,
                  as he expressed himself, that he shook hands with me and said that he thought
                  better of me than ever, that I had acted quite right, and should immediately have
                  an interview with his daughter."</p>
               <p>"I trust," said Alice, "that you have had no difficulty in that quarter."</p>
               <p>"A little, at first, I must confess. Miss Barton readily overlooked everything the
                  gossiping newspapers had said, excepting the allusions to the beauty of the young
                  heiress, whom I, forsooth, (so it was hinted) had been <emph>trying</emph> to
                  win."</p>
               <p>Alice smiled, and said that she hoped her cousin had satisfied Miss Barton of the
                  Falsity of these statements.</p>
               <p>"Well, I did, after a while," replied George, smiling in his turn. "A little to
                  your detriment, my fair coz. All is fair, they say, in love and war, and I plead
                  guilty to a little subterfuge, and obliquity of expression. I told her you were a
                  perfect fright, an uncouth, red-faced English girl, whose sole attraction was your
                  money bags, and that I never, for one moment entertained a particle of affection
                  for you, for if I had demonstrated the slightest partiality, you would have jumped
                  into my arms, and——"</p>
               <p>"Stop, stop," said Alice, laughing heartily, and placing her hand upon her
                  cousin's mouth, "you call this a trifling obliquity of expression, eh, sir? Why
                  it's downright falsehood, and you know it. You ought to be made to do penance in a
                  white sheet. Gerald ought to call you out. Who ever heard of such audacity?
                  However, since I am married and my ugliness is no longer in the market, seeking a
                  purchaser, into whose arms to jump, I forgive you this once, and go so far in my
                  generosity as to hope that your pleading was successful."</p>
               <p>"So successful," replied George, "that we are to be married on my return to
                  Kingston, and in the course of a weeks we shall be on our way to Calcutta. What my
                  father intends doing there I don't know. Probably nothing. I know him to be in
                  possession of a handsome fortune, and this knowledge increases my surprise at his
                  action in relation to this Cuban property. He has lived for many years in India.
                  All his friends are there, and I suppose he intends to spend the remainder of his
                  days in that country."</p>
               <p>"Do you think it likely that you will remain?" inquired Gerald.</p>
               <p>"That I cannot say. My father has influence there, and can no doubt, procure me a
                  good appointment, and both Mary and I look forward to the voyage, and Mary is in
                  extacies at the idea of seeing a distant country of which she has heard and read
                  so much."</p>
               <p>Georage very much enjoyed his visit, and he and Gerald laid the foundation of a
                  friendship, which has never been broken.</p>
               <p>But the day was at hand on which he was to set out on his return to Jamaica, and
                  to meet his expectant <foreign xml:lang="FRA">fiancee,</foreign> and with mutual
                  good wishes and expressions of friendship, they parted.</p>
               <p>Gerald was now growing anxious to visit the United States. The recollections of
                  early boyhood which shed a golden halo upon the localities wherein that early
                  boyhood had been spent, aided not little by all that he had heard and read of the
                  rapid progress of the land in which he had drawn his first breath, had determined
                  him, now that he was enabled to gratify his often expressed wish, to visit
                  America, to make the United States his future home; beside, he had business there
                  which might prove of importance, and he wished, consequently, to visit Cincinnati,
                  where his father's farm had been located, and to see this Mr. Brower, whom he
                  recollected as his fellow-passenger in the Liverpool stage, and of whom his mother
                  had written in one of her last letters to him when in India.</p>
               <p>Preparations were accordingly made for the passage to New<pb n="350-351"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000176"/> York, and very soon after George Craddock sailed
                  for Jamaica Gerald and his wife were on their way to the United States.</p>
               <p>During the passage Gerald related to Alice his own faint recollections of his
                  native land, and all that he recollected having heard from his mother, at
                  different times, of his father's hard experience there. With the names of Mr.
                  Biggin and Mr. Jenkins, the publisher, he was quite familiar, his mother had often
                  spoken of his father's connection with the "<title>Trumpeter of Freedom,</title>"
                  and of the oddities of its proprietor and editor, and also of Mr. Dalton's
                  interview with the publisher, who would not listen to him because he had no a
                  European reputation. Washington Irving's works and Cooper's novels, and Bancroft's
                  and Prescott's histories, and the speeches of Calhoun, and Clay and Webster, had
                  been eulogized in England, and their names become household words—and, on one
                  occasion, when Gerald was reading aloud to his mother, in her sitting-room at
                  Herrington, one of the then newly published works of the first-named author, with
                  whose praises the newspapers and reviews of England were ringing, Mrs. Dalton had
                  smilingly mentioned to Gerald the fact, of the publisher's stating to his father,
                  that this young man would never acquire a European reputation.</p>
               <p>"I should like to see these people," said the young man, to Alice, "but several
                  years have passed away since then, and they may be no longer living."</p>
               <p>It was a fine bright morning in June, when the schooner, on board which they had
                  taken passage, arrived in the Bay of New York, the extraordinary beauty of which
                  drew many an exclamation of delight from both. The sun shone gloriously and the
                  still waters of the bay reflected his beams with dazzling brightness. The sloping
                  shores, green and thickly wooded, and studded with villas and farm-houses and
                  small villages, formed a beautiful frame-work to the nautical landscape—and the
                  countless vessels, of all sorts and sizes, from the magnificent "liner" to the
                  North river sloop, impressed the beholder with a grand idea of the wealth and of
                  the unlimited commerce of the country.</p>
               <p>"Yours is indeed a glorious country," said Alice in a whisper, pressing her
                  husband's hand, "I shall readily become an American too, Gerald; but, you will not
                  forget, that your mother and father were English, and that the bones of the former
                  lie beneath English soil?"</p>
               <p>"No," said Gerald, earnestly, "and it would be well if it were more generally
                  remembered by others whose English ancestry is more remote, that the bones of
                  their forefathers lie mouldering in English graves, and that English men and women
                  would recollect, too, that their children have peopled this great and growing
                  country, and that every instance of its progress reflects honor upon England. The
                  people of both countries are to blame when any source of difficulty arises between
                  them. Having naturally an almost equal affection and admiration for both
                  countries, I have often read with disgust the tirades in the English newspapers
                  against the United States, written, as it would appear, with no other object than
                  to keep alive a feeling of distrust and jealously that must be injurious to their
                  mutual interest. I have seldom had an opportunity of seeing an American newspaper;
                  but, I have been told that they are equally to blame. I shall soon know whether
                  this be true or not. I hope not; for it appears to me to be one of the foolishest
                  things on earth for two such nations as England and the United States to seek out,
                  as it were, causes of quarrel, when united in indissoluble friendship they might
                  do so much for the happiness and prosperity of the whole world."</p>
               <p>"Whence arises this feeling of jealously?" inquired Alice.</p>
               <p>"It is hard to say," replied her husband; "but you know, Alice, that the most
                  difficult quarrels to heal, are those which occur between different branches of
                  the same family. I will illustrate the subject after a homely fashion.—An old
                  couple having a larger family than they can conveniently maintain at home, send
                  them to a distant farm, which they stock for them, and the cultivation of which
                  they superintend, while the children are yet too young to manage for themselves.
                  This is all very<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC7199-00000177"/> well; but by and by,
                  the children grow to manhood, and fancy that they can manage their own affairs
                  more satisfactorily for themselves than their parents can for them. All they want
                  is to do this, and they are still willing to be subject, after an independent
                  fashion, to the old folks at home; but the old folks being rather a meddlesome
                  couple, found of arranging every other family's affairs to their own liking, as a
                  matter of course get into a great many scrapes and quarrels; to get the more
                  easily out of which, they call upon their children, who are doing very comfortably
                  on their distant farm, to help them, by selling a large portion of their produce.
                  They object to this since the quarrels which have involved their parents have been
                  none of their seeking—still they say, if you will place us on an equality with
                  yourselves, we will do what is reasonable in the matter. This assumption of even
                  partial independence affronts the old folks, who contend that the farm is theirs,
                  and that the children are only there on sufferance.</p>
               <p>"But," reply the children, "see how we have improved it. We found it a waste, and
                  before long it will be richer than the old homestead."</p>
               <p>"Who helped you to do so?" ask the old folks.</p>
               <p>"You, at first," reply the children, "and we feel grateful for your aid; "but
                  latterly we begin to discover that it is you that are receiving aid from us, even
                  to the robbing of our own families. We are willing to do the thing that's right,
                  but there is such a thing as asking too much."</p>
               <p>"Parents cannot ask too much of their children," say the old couple.</p>
               <p>"But," reply the children, "you should recollect we are not all children of yours.
                  We have received a considerable accession of young folks from other families that
                  have no connection with you; and then some of our younger brothers ran away from
                  home and joined us, because you used them so harshly, and insisted upon their
                  going to the Established Church on Sunday, when they wanted to go to Meeting. You
                  surely have no claim upon these; besides, we have married among these cousins and
                  these visitors from other families, and have children of our own growing up, who,
                  having never seen their grandparents, can't be expected to have any very strong
                  attachment to them—at least, not so strong an attachment, as to be willing to
                  supply them with the food they require themselves, for though we are thriving
                  finely, we are young yet, and have not been able to lay up money in our coffers as
                  you have, and it really requires our utmost efforts at present to support our own
                  families.</p>
               <p>"This was reasonable argument enough, but the old folks were obstinate, and
                  wouldn't listen to it, but said they'd take, by force, what they couldn't get for
                  love; and the spirit of the young people was roused at this, and they dared them
                  to come on the farm at their peril. But they treated this threat with contempt,
                  and did come and behaved very cruelly, not at all like parents ought to
                  behave—burning down hay-ricks and the stores of grain that the children had laid
                  aside for a rainy day, and doing all the mischief they could. The children,
                  however, resisted with all their might and some of the children of a neighbor of
                  the old couple, with whom they had been quarrelling all their lives, come over to
                  the farm and took the part of the young people; and after a long struggle they
                  finally compelled the old folks to go back to the old homestead and promise never
                  to interfere any more with the management of the farm.</p>
               <p>"After some time, things on the farm were put to rights again, and the farm
                  thrived more than ever, and the old people benefited by the change. They were
                  better off than ever, by exchanging goods with the young people, although a
                  lawyer, named Burke whom they had consulted during the quarrel, had told them that
                  the loss of the farm would prove the sunset of the old homestead. When they saw
                  this, they became pretty good friends again, until, some years after, another
                  quarrel occurred in consequence of the old couple insisting upon searching the
                  young people's farm wagons in which they carried their<pb n="354-355"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000178"/> goods to market, under the pretence that they had
                  kidnapped some of the younger branches of the old people's family, and concealed
                  them among the produce. This second quarrel was settled after a short time, and
                  since then they have rubbed along pretty comfortably together, and would continue
                  to do so, if certain quarrelsome members of both branches of the family, who,
                  generally speaking, have no interests at stake, did not persist in endeavoring to
                  set them by the cars, merely for the sake of their own aggrandizement. More than
                  once they have nearly succeeded in doing so, but the good sense of the more
                  respectable and responsible members of both families, who are beginning to think
                  that it is to their mutual interest to be friendly together, and to aid and assist
                  one another, since the old people having laid by a good stock of money, and
                  valuable household goods, can exchange these commodities with the young people's
                  farm produce, and both be gainers by the transfer. Some people think, that if
                  anything really serious should happen to either branch of the family—such for
                  instance as a combination of other families to crush their rights and
                  liberties—they would immediately unite and punish the offenders; and one thing is
                  pretty certain, that united, they would be more than a match for any combination
                  that could be brought against them. But you see, my love, how difficult it is to
                  heal breaches that have occurred in a family."</p>
               <p>While Alice had been an amused listener to Gerald's illustration, the schooner had
                  arrived opposite the city, and came to an anchor. They took leave of the captain
                  of the vessel and went on shore as soon as possible, and Gerald hiring a carriage,
                  requested the driver to carry them to the Astor House.</p>
               <p>After partaking of dinner and resting themselves, Gerald proposed a walk in
                  Broadway.</p>
               <p>Alice readily assented to this proposition, and they set out together. Alice was
                  delighted with all she saw.</p>
               <p>"Everybody, almost, appears well dressed, and well off," she said, "but yet
                  everybody looks so earnest and thoughtful; every gentleman at least—that it is
                  painful to observe the expression of their countenances; and how they are hurrying
                  along the street! Surely some great calamity must have occurred."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no," said Gerald, smiling at her observation, "Everybody wears that
                  expression here, especially in business hours; I was too young to notice it when
                  here before, but I have heard my mother and others speak of it."</p>
               <p>"But what is the cause?" asked Alice.</p>
               <p>"It is difficult to say. An eager anxiety to make money, some assert. For my part,
                  I think there are other causes, though these may have led to that result. The
                  people of this country, when it was first settled, had much to contend with, and
                  it required all their energies to combat the obstacles they encountered;
                  consequently the ancestors, even of the men of the present generation, had little
                  time to spare for recreation. They made their business a recreation, and the
                  result has been that this restless seeking after business has descended to their
                  children. The country has progressed in an unprecedented—a wonderful manner; but
                  it is a young country yet. Perhaps by-and-by this constant eagerness may give way
                  to a less fatiguing and exciting, and I must acknowledge a more sensible method of
                  doing business. But what do you think of the ladies?"</p>
               <p>"They are almost universally pretty, and dressed magnificently—too magnificently,
                  I think, for good taste."</p>
               <p>"And yet," said Gerald, smiling, "I warrant before you have been here six months,
                  you will be as eager to be in the fashion as anybody. I declare, I am almost
                  ashamed to walk with you, you look so dowdy-like."</p>
               <p>"For shame!" said Alice, playfully tapping her husband's arm with her parasol. "If
                  you think so, you have your remedy; go into that linen-draper's shop and buy me
                  that handsome shawl, and then I shall look as fine as your own country women."</p>
               <p>"There!" said Gerald, "was I not right? You haven't been<pb n="356-357"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000179"/> three hours in America till you begin to catch the
                  contagion. But you will be laughed at if speak of a linen-draper's shop. The term
                  here is dry goods store."</p>
               <p>"Well, any term you please," said Alice; "but you shall not think to get off that
                  way; you shall buy me that shawl as an atonement for your impertinence."</p>
               <p>They entered the store, and Gerald purchased the article in question. When they
                  came out of the store, Gerald asked his wife what she thought of Broadway.</p>
               <p>"It is a very beautiful thoroughfare," she replied, "and very gay, almost as gay,
                  though after a very different style, as the Boulevards of Paris, and a great deal
                  more bustling; but that may be because it is so much narrower. Many of the
                  buildings, too, are really magnificent, and when the street is finished, it will
                  be one of the handsomest I have ever seen; but some of the houses are old and out
                  of character."</p>
               <p>"When the street is finished!" said Gerald, laughing, "I don't recollect much
                  about it myself, but I believe it was about as nearly finished, at least this
                  portion of it, when I was here before, thirteen years ago, as it is now, and about
                  as far finished now as it ever will be."</p>
               <p>"Why," said Alice, "I thought from the piles of brick laying about, and the timber
                  stretching across the causeway, that it was a newly opened thorough fare, and that
                  these old houses had stood on the old line of street; it's not one or two new
                  buildings that I see going up, but one here and there, as far as the eye can
                  reach; and then these heaps of packing cases and goods on the pavement, are they
                  not waiting to be carried in by persons who have recently moved here?"</p>
               <p>"Not at all," said Gerald; "the street pavement is considered part of the
                  legitimate store, and this constant scrambling over piles of lumber and all sorts
                  of obstacles, and dodging occasionally out into the street, at the risk of being
                  run over by the omnibusses, is supposed by the city authorities to impart vigor to
                  the limbs of the citizens, and to inspire them with confidence and disregard of
                  danger."</p>
               <p>Alice looked up into her husband's face to see if he were joking or not, and
                  noticing her looks, he continued:</p>
               <p>"The very quality that I have just alluded to, the constant eagerness to have
                  something better than one's neighbors, leads to this continual change in the
                  aspect of things. I have been told that Americans leaving New York for a year or
                  two have found things so changed on their return, that they have failed to
                  recognize the localities they formerly knew well. They have found not only houses
                  built where vacant lots stood before, and houses so altered and improved that the
                  character of the street has undergone a change, but new streets and thoroughfares
                  opened as miraculously, as it appears to the returned citizen, as if the genii of
                  Aladdin's lamp had been summoned to do the work. So with Broadway; it is built
                  anew every few years, and ten to one the most magnificent structures you now
                  admire will in a few years give place to others to gratify the whim or
                  extravagance perchance of some new owner, for property here is continually
                  changing hands. However, I am proud of my native city."</p>
               <p>"And you have good reason to be so, returned Alice. There is something inspiring
                  in this very eagerness after novelty, and this continual change with all its
                  inconveniences; and then," she added, laughing, "this mingling of old and new
                  houses, and this varied style of architecture, is so perfectly democratic. That
                  old house there, which appears aged enough to be a relic of the Revolution. seems
                  to say to its proud neighbor, 'I have as good a right to stand on Broadway as
                  you.'"</p>
               <p>They rambled about, examining, admiring and criticising all they saw, until Alice
                  began to feel weary, when they returned to the hotel.</p>
               <p>That evening, Gerald, who had preserved Mr. Brown's address, wrote to him and
                  informed him of his intended visit to Cincinnati, but said that he should await
                  his reply in New York, as he should not leave the city for a week or two.</p>
               <p>Gerald and his wife took frequent walks in all parts of the<pb n="358-359"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000180"/> city worth seeing, and made several excursions in
                  its vicinity, and Gerald often took a stroll through the streets alone, when Alice
                  was tired, or disinclined to join him.</p>
               <p>On one of these occasions he stopped before a book store in a narrow street, and
                  stood carelessly examining the titles of the volumes exposed for sale in the
                  window. Happening to cast his eye upwards, towards the sigh over the door, he read
                  the inscription, "Albert Jenkins, Bookseller and Publisher."</p>
               <p>"Can this be the person," he thought, "of whom I have so often heard my mother
                  speak?"</p>
               <p>He resolved to satisfy himself, and walking into the store, asked for a copy of
                  lrving's Knickerbocker.</p>
               <p>"I have not got it in the store, sir," replied a grey-headed, spectacled old
                  gentleman, who was seated at a desk at the farther end of the store, and who came
                  forward as he spoke. "You will find it at Mr. Irving's publisher, Mr. Putnam."</p>
               <p>"It's of no consequence," replied Gerald, "I am a stranger here, stopping at the
                  Astor House, and merely want a book for my wife to read. Have you any of Cooper's
                  novels?"</p>
               <p>"All of them, sir. Which do you want?"</p>
               <p>"Give me the latest one that has been published. I have read all the early ones in
                  England. Cooper has a great name there."</p>
               <p>"Are you an Englishman?" carelessly asked the bookseller, apparently merely for
                  the sake of saying something.</p>
               <p>"No, I was born in New York; but, I have been for many years abroad, and I must
                  acknowledge that I have felt some pride when I have heard the genius of my
                  countrymen eulogized in other lands. Formerly a European reputation was required;
                  now, it is not necessary, for the sale of an American book."</p>
               <p>"No, sir, no," said the bookseller with a sigh, (he was evidently one of the olden
                  school who regret the progress of the times.) "No, sir,—I have here," pointing to
                  his shelves, "a large collection of the old standard authors, sir, Shakspeare,
                  Addison, Fielding, Smollett, Mrs. Radcliffe, Miss Porter, and a host of others. I
                  used to sell them freely, now they are seldom asked for. The trade has changed
                  sir, sadly changed, and there is little or no demand for any but American books.
                  As you say sir, nobody stops to inquire now, if an author has achieved a European
                  reputation."</p>
               <p>"If they gain an American one, I should think they hardly need such, although it
                  is almost sure to follow."</p>
               <p>"Still, sir, I cannot but consider it a sad falling off. It has caused a vast
                  change to take place in the publishing trade. Formerly there were only a few of
                  us; now, publishers are to be found in shoals, and most of the old houses are
                  unheard of, they no longer exist."</p>
               <p>Seeing that the old gentleman was inclined to be chatty, Gerald, after having
                  purchased and paid for a couple of volumes, continued the conversation, by asking
                  the bookseller if he had been long in the business.</p>
               <p>"More than thirty-five years," he replied, "I am getting very old now, and merely
                  remain in business, for the sake of amusement. I sell but little and publish
                  nothing at all. Young houses have sprung up into collossal magnitude, that were
                  unheard of when I commenced business. There is the Harpers' establishment, twenty
                  years ago it did not exist—now, more books are published by that firm, than are
                  published by any other house in America, and few in Europe exceed them in the
                  number and variety of their publications. If they go on thus much longer, they
                  will be the greatest publishers in the world. I could name many others. It is a
                  sad state of things, sir, a sad state of things."</p>
               <p>Not being exactly able to view this state of things in the light they were seen by
                  Mr. Jenkins, or even thoroughly to comprehend the old gentleman's meaning, Gerald
                  was about to wish him good-day and leave the store, when the idea struck him to
                  make inquiry respecting Mr. Biggin.</p>
               <p>"By-the-by," said he, "do you know a person of the name of Biggin—a newspaper
                  man,—who, many years ago, published the "<title>Trumpeter of Freedom?</title>"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Biggin—Mr. Amos Biggin, I presume you mean,"<pb n="360-361"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000181"/> said Mr. Jenkins. "He has published several
                  newspapers which have had but a brief existence, and has been engaged in various
                  descriptions of business. I don't know what he is now engaged in—he has been an
                  unfortunate man, sir—very unfortunate. But here is the directory, perhaps you will
                  find his name there."</p>
               <p>Gerald took the volume and looked along the pages "B," until he found the name he
                  sought. There it was, "Amos Biggin—Bowery office of the Gift Penwiper
                  Society."</p>
               <p>"Have you found the name, sir," inquired the bookseller.</p>
               <p>"Yes; here it is, Amos Biggin, office of the Gift Penwiper Society—Bowery.' What
                  is the meaning of a Gift pen-wiper society?"</p>
               <p>"Ah! I recollect now, I might have recollected sooner," said the bookseller, "Yes,
                  I heard that Biggin had started that speculation. He is President of the Society,
                  I believe. It is a description of Mutual Benefit Society, which has sprung up of
                  late years, by the aid of which on purchasing a trifling article, the purchaser
                  has a chance of receiving an article of great value."</p>
               <p>"Thank you," said Gerald, "My father was acquainted with the gentleman, and I
                  should like to see him," and wishing the bookseller good-day, he walked out of the
                  store.</p>
               <p>Gaining th Bowery, Gerald had no difficulty in finding the Gift Establishment, for
                  he had hardly entered the thoroughfare, before he saw opposite him, on the other
                  side of the street, the name of Amos Biggin, in flaunting gold letters, heading a
                  black board with gilded letters, setting forth the advantages that would accrue to
                  all who invested two shillings in the purchase of a pen-wiper, the corners of the
                  board being decorated with immense parti-colored pen-wipers, and the board itself
                  being set in a frame-work of pen-wipers of smaller dimensions.</p>
               <p>crossing the street, he entered the store, when a portly gentleman tleman, of
                  pompous aspect and florid countenance, although beginning to show signs of age in
                  his wrinkled brow and shrunken mouth, advanced to the counter and inquired his
                  business, at the same time pushing towards him a heap of colored pen-wipers, as if
                  to choose from.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Amos Biggin, I presume?" said Gerald, disregarding the merchandise before
                  him.</p>
               <p>"The same, at your service," replied the individual addressed.</p>
               <p>"You at one time published a newspaper, entitled the <title>Trumpeter of
                     Freedom?</title>"</p>
               <p>"I did sir, many years ago. Let me see, it must be now eighteen or nineteen years
                  since the <title>Trumpeter of Freedom</title> burst up. I have published several
                  newspapers since then, sir. You may have heard of the '<title>Denouncer,</title>'
                  and the <title>Democratic Thunderer.</title>' I had the honor to start both those
                  sheets, sir; but they burst up, too. The envy of the monopolizing sheets, sir,
                  proved too much for them. There was not, I am sorry to say, sufficient
                  independence on the part of the public to enable me to carry out my views, or I
                  would have shown to the world my idea of a good newspaper. But the public, sir,
                  the public, always looking to the present and regardless of the welfare of
                  posterity, wanted the news that my availabilities would not allow of my procuring,
                  and they bought the venial sheets, and allowed my independent patriotic journal to
                  fall to the ground. But, may I inquire your name, sir, and the cause of you taking
                  an interest in the by-gone <title>Trumpeter of Freedom?</title>'</p>
               <p>"My name is Dalton—Gerald Dalton, and my father was associated with you on the
                     <title>Trumpeter of Freedom.</title> I have been abroad for many years and just
                  now, seeing your name in the directory, I thought I would call, not exactly for
                  old acquaintance sake, since I don't know that I ever saw you; but still for the
                  sake of old recollections. I was born during the period my father was associated
                  with you on that journal."</p>
               <p>"Indeed, I am glad to see you, sir," said Mr. Biggin. "Pray<pb n="362-363"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000182"/> take a seat. Now you mention the name, I recollect
                  your father well—a most excellent gentleman. Still living and prospering, I hope.
                  And I recollect, too the circumstance of your birth. Spoilt a most excellent
                  leader of mine, sir. It came out not only misspelt, but full of ridiculous
                  grammatical errors—the printer's, of course—I always left the revision of my
                  articles to your father. I had full confidence in him, seldom found occasion to
                  find fault with him; but the misfortune had a bad effect upon the paper—very bad.
                  The editor of the "Raven," a scurrilous opposition sheet, started for a paltry
                  election purpose, had the vandalism to publish in his vile journal, a card
                  purporting to be sent in by your father, saying that his wife having given birth
                  to a son, he, the sub-editor of the <title>Trumpeter,</title> had been unable t
                  attend to the revision of the principal editor's leaders, and that consequently,
                  he hoped the public would excuse the bad grammar and abominable spelling. But
                  that's gone by, now, sir. How is your father?"</p>
               <p>"My father has been dead many years," replied Gerald, "and I have been abroad
                  since I was eight years of age. I am glad to see you doing so apparently
                  prosperous a business, though, to judge from appearances—"</p>
               <p>"Ah, Mr. Dalton," replied Mr. Biggin, "appearances are deceitful. You see in me,
                  sir, as I often said to your lamented father, an ill-used man. One whose purposes
                  have been misunderstood, and whose endeavors to ameliorate the condition of his
                  fellow creatures, have all proved miserable failures. I have tried several things
                  besides newspaper publishing. I have been a biologist, and have endeavored to
                  reconcile the antipathies of mind and matter. I have been in the spirit line and
                  endeavored to inculcate a taste for good genuine liquors among my countrymen, but
                  in vain; I burst up, and I have been in the spiritual line; an humble preacher at
                  one time, at another, a teacher of the mysteries of spiritualism; but I failed in
                  all, was called an impostor, a charlatan, a toe-rapper, everything that is
                  abusive.</p>
               <p>"But in this present occupation?" said Gerald.</p>
               <p>"In this occupation, sir, every intelligent man would conceive there was a fair
                  field for success. What can be grander than its conception? Where a nobler union
                  of the humble and the magnificent than is to be found in the object of this
                  society? Think, sir, of a pen-wiper and a brown stone mansion in the Fifth avenue,
                  or a pen-wiper and a farm of one hundred acres of land among the Rocky Mountains,
                  or a pen-wiper and a pair of splendid bays, and a neat buggy behind them! Reason
                  quails in making the comparison, and yet the penwiper is as useful in its way as
                  either of the other things mentioned. The main object of my life has been to leave
                  the name behind me when I am laid in the grave, of a benefactor to my fellow men.
                  I should wish parents to lead their prattling children to my lowly tomb and to
                  say, 'look, my children, and weep! beneath that stone lie the mortal remains of
                  Amos Biggin, the great philanthropist, and the benefactor of his species. Weep
                  over his grave and go and follow his example, and lie in such a grave when you
                  die.' But, alas! the fates have been against me and if any child follows my
                  example, such is the wickedness of the world, that very likely he would die
                  without having any grave to lie in at all."</p>
               <p>"You have been unfortunate, indeed," said Gerald.</p>
               <p>"You may well say so," continued Mr. Biggin. "Bankrupt in purse, and bowed with
                  years, I still sought to gain what had been the aim of my life, the esteem of my
                  fellow men. Casting about how I should accomplish this and, in the ruined state of
                  my finances, the glorious idea of the penwiper struck me. What innumerable
                  garments are ruined annually, I said to myself, in consequence of the abominable
                  and slovenly practice of wiping pens on coat-tails. How many gross of steel pens
                  are corroded before their time by the negligence of those who never wipe the ink
                  from their pens at all. How many innocent children's mouths are cankered by the
                  practice of sucking the ink from their pens at school. Similar thoughts<pb
                     n="364-365" xml:id="VAC7199-00000183"/> crowded upon my imagination, and I
                  resolved to dispose of penwipers in such a manner that the use of them should
                  become general.</p>
               <p>"Old clothes," I said, "will supply the cloth, and old clothes are cheap, and by
                  making the pen-wipers parti-colored, I shall instill, by the judicious arrangement
                  of these colors, a love of the beautiful in the juvenile bosom. The magnificent
                  idea of a Gift Society flashed upon me like a clap of thunder—I mean a streak of
                  lightning—and I drew out a prospectus—a glorious idea, sir. Here is one"—handing a
                  paper to Gerald from a heap that lay on the counter—"read it at your leisure. You
                  will see that by expending the small sum of two shillings in the purchase of a
                  pen-wiper, the purchaser has a chance when pen-wipers are sold to the number of
                  one million—a very small calculation, you will perceive, out of the twenty-two
                  millions comprising our population—of obtaining something of value ranging from
                  one dollar to twenty thousand dollars—from a smelling-bottle to a brown stone
                  mansion with out-houses and all necessary conveniences, situated in the most
                  fashionable part of the city. You will see that I have made the following
                  calculation. One million quarters amount to two hundred and fifty thousand
                  dollars. Out of this sum I propose to expend two hundred thousand dollars in
                  gifts, only reserving to myself the paltry sum of fifty thousand dollars, out of
                  which I pay all the expenses. The idea is a grand one; and yet, sir, would you—can
                  you credit it, the public is so blind to its own interests that I have not sold a
                  dozen pen-wipers in more than two months that the society has been established?
                  Only two of these have I been paid the stipulated price for; they were purchases
                  by a countryman who was seeing the city; the others I sold to children for a cent
                  apiece. I am disgusted with human nature, and would sell the entire stock at the
                  same rate, for quarter day is drawing near, and I have not wherewith to pay the
                  first quarter's rent."</p>
               <p>Gerald duly sympathized with the unfortunate Amos Biggin gin, and lamented the
                  blindness of the public, and then having invested a dollar in the purchase of four
                  red, white and green pen-wipers, quitted the store. This was the last he saw of
                  Amos Biggin, although he heard some time after that he was again endeavoring to
                  establish a campaign newspaper, the Gold Pen Association, consisting of Amos
                  Biggin himself, who was president, board of directors, secretary and clerks in his
                  own person, having to use Mr. Biggin's own terms, "burst up," paying somethig less
                  than a mill on the dollar.</p>
               <p>Gerald's letter to Mr. Brower led to visit from that gentleman himself. He
                  expressed great satisfaction at seeing his young stage-coach acquaintance, and
                  recalled to his recollection his prophecy that the piece of swamp land would one
                  day be valuable property.</p>
               <p>"It is so now," he said, "and will become still more valuable. But you must go
                  with me to Ohio and see it, and take Mrs. Dalton with you."</p>
               <p>This arrangement was agreed upon, and after Mr. Brower had transacted the other
                  business which had called him to New York, Gerald and his wife set out with him
                  for Ohio. He found that his late father's farm had been situated near where now
                  one of the finest canals in the state was being cut, and the piece of swamp land
                  that no one thought it worth while to take as a gift, now of itself afforded a
                  considerable income. Mr. Brower had built warehouses upon it, and it was settled
                  in a manner satisfactory to all parties, that Mr. Brower should continue to rent
                  it of Gerald. He did not understand the business in which it would be necessary to
                  engage if he had decided to hold it himself, nor would it have been right to
                  dislodge Mr. Brower after all he had effected; besides, Gerald knew that he would
                  be required to make frequent visits to Cuba to look after his wife's interests
                  there. So, after making a tour of the state, and extending their tour in various
                  other directions, he and Alice returned to New York, with the intention of
                  remaining in that city until they had decided in what part of the country to
                  settle.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Conclusion, which treats of various matters, each necessary to the winding up
                     of the Story, and which, the author hopes, winds up everything to the
                     satisfaction of the reader.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SOME time elapsed before Gerald Dalton and Alice decided upon the locality wherein
                  they should reside. At length, Gerald purchased a villa in New Hampshire, the
                  beautiful scenery with which the neighborhood abounded, having made his wife, as
                  she expressed herself, "in love with the spot." Thither they removed and resided,
                  Gerald turning his attention to amateur farming for amusement, although he was
                  frequently obliged to visit Cuba, and, during the course of five years, paid two
                  visits to England. On one of the visits Alice accompanied him, and two or three
                  times before she had any offspring to engage her attention at home, she went with
                  him to Cuba, in two instances remaining in that country during its delightful
                  winter season.</p>
               <p>Of course when Gerald went to England, he always visited his friends at
                  Herrington, which was beginning to rise out of its squalor, and promised to be,
                  what it now is, the chief port of outlet to France. A short time after his first
                  visit, Jemmy Milton paid the debt of nature, at the age of seventy-one. The vicar
                  wrote to Gerald, informing him of the death of his old friend, and, it was on the
                  receipt of this letter that he again resolved to visit England. Indeed, Mr. Pearce
                  urged the visit, in order that he might be present when the will of the old sailor
                  was read.</p>
               <p>From the vicar's lips he heard the following account of the last days of his old
                  and attached friend.</p>
               <p>"Jemmy had been failing for some months," said the vicar to Gerald, the day after
                  his arrival at Herrington, when both gentleman were seated in the study at the
                  vicarage, "but for a couple of weeks before he died his infirmities increased
                  rapidly. He suffered no pain; in fact labored under no illness, excepting that he
                  felt an occasional twinge of rheumatism; but appeared to be slowly dying of old
                  age. About a week before his death he became so weak that the crutches which he
                  had made use of for some time were no longer of any service to him, and he hd to
                  be supported every fine day to the old boat-house on the beach, to which favorite
                  resort he persisted in going to the last. He was very fond of sitting and enjoying
                  his pipe, while his landlady's daughter, of whom he was very fond, read to him
                  from the bible, and from tracts and other books I supplied her with, and there, in
                  the old boathouse, would he sit, till the sun went down, and some of the fishermen
                  returning from their daily labors, assisted him home.</p>
               <p>"One day, the very day on which he died, little Molly Nelson came in a great hurry
                  to the vicarage and requested to see me, and when I sent for her to the study, she
                  said, that Jemmy Milton had sent him compliments and wished to see the vicar as
                  soon as convenient. She is a very nice well-spoken, well-behaved girl this Molly
                  Nelson, and she acquitted herself of her errand very prettily. I have been
                  speaking to my housekeeper about taking her into my service.</p>
               <p>"Is Jemmy Milton any worse to-day, my dear?" I asked.</p>
               <p>"No, your reverence," she replied, "I don't think he's any worse; but, when I was
                  going to read to him, as usual, after John Molson had led him to the boat-house,
                  he told me to go up directly to the vicarage and ask you to call and see him. He
                  said he had something very particular to talk to you about."</p>
               <p>"I was writing my sermon for the next sabbath at the time; but I laid my books and
                  manuscript aside, and went at once with the child to the beach.</p>
               <pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC7199-00000185"/>
               <p>"When we reached the boat-house, Jemmy was sitting on the bench inside, smoking
                  his pipe as usual. An open bible was lying on the table before him and he had his
                  spectacles on and appeared to be attentively reading its pages; but he closed the
                  book when I entered, saying:</p>
               <p>"I've been a tryin' to read a chapter to myself, while Molly was away to the
                  vicarage for you, but I didn't make much headway. I never was a very easy reader,
                  and now my eyesight is so bad, that I cannot see one word from another."</p>
               <p>"I looked earnestly at the old man, but I did not observe any change since I had
                  seen him last—only a few days before.</p>
               <p>"Shall I read a chapter to you, Jemmy, or will you hear Molly read?" said I, "She
                  reads very nicely."</p>
               <p>"Molly shall read to me, presently," he replied, "She is a good girl, and very
                  attentive to me; but, first of all, I want to talk to you, alone, sir. Here,
                  Molly," he said, "here's a shilling for you, and go and take a walk and buy
                  something for yourself and come back, like a good girl, in half an hour, and read
                  to me."</p>
               <p>"As soon as the little girl had gone out the old man turned his face towards me,
                  and speaking very seriously, inquired whether I was a believer in dreams.</p>
               <p>"No," I answered, "dreams are mere vagaries of the imagination, and they are
                  generally caused by the recollection during sleep of some event that has passed,
                  and are tinged by what our thoughts have been engaged upon during the day. When
                  they come true, the truths they may appear to have foretold have usually been the
                  result of circumstances we had a previous knowledge of and which were likely to
                  lead to some particular result. The result would naturally have been the same
                  whether we dreamed it or not."</p>
               <p>"You talk very larned upon the subject," he replied; "but I had a strange dream
                  last night, which I fancy has a moral in it, and I made bold to send for your
                  reverence, to ax your opinion consarnin' it."</p>
               <p>"I have no objection to hear it, Jemmy," I replied; "but you should not let such
                  things trouble your mind,—dreams, as I have told you, are idle vageries"</p>
               <p>"I scarcely agree with you, sir," interrupted Gerald; "you have heard of the
                  dream—if indeed it were only a dream—which occurred to me at the very time of my
                  mother's death."</p>
               <p>"I have," replied the vicar, "and my theory has not been altered in the slightest
                  degree after hearing it, It was a singular and startling coincidence, I grant, but
                  your thoughts had for a long time been centered upon your mother and the village
                  of Abbottsford, where you had last seen her. You knew that she was in failing
                  health, and your conscience, as you have told me, was constantly reproaching you
                  for remaining so long absent from her. That very night you had, for the first
                  time, opened a volume she had presented you with but a short time before you
                  parted from her. You had read therein a quotation from Cowper, in her handwriting,
                  written at the time she presented you with the book—you have told me that she
                  begged you to remember the conversation that had previously taken place—your brain
                  was fevered with the broodings of your imagination, and your mind agitated with
                  these recollections thus suddenly forced upon you in the stillness of the
                  night—and when you insensibly fell asleep, you dreamed the dream that you fancied
                  to be a waking vision. Even the word 'remember,' which you thought you heard from
                  your mother's lips, and the fact of her uttering that word immediately before she
                  died, leads me to no other conclusion. You had recalled that word to your memory
                  that night. She, perhaps, was thinking of the time when she presented you with the
                  volume, and at that very moment she drew her last breath. As to the dream which
                  followed after you had lain yourself down in your hammock, that was but the sequel
                  of the first. It was a remarkable coincidence, I repeat, nothing more."</p>
               <p>Gerald was incredulous, but he did not reply, and the vicar continued his
                  relation.</p>
               <pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC7199-00000186"/>
               <p>"Jemmy went on to tell me the nature of the dream that troubled his mind.</p>
               <p>"I thought," said he, "I was sitting in the old boathouse, as usual; the sun was
                  about setting, and the sea was all sparkling with gold and silver as it reflected
                  his rays. Presently, while I was looking at the water and admiring the beauty of
                  the scene, I seed a large ship suddenly bearin' down channel under all sail. She
                  looked like a man-o'-war with all her canvas set. Her canvas was as white as snow,
                  and her hull as clean and bright as if she'd just left the dockyard. While I was
                  a-set-tin', wondering what ship she was, and how she came there, all of a sudden
                  like—for I never seed her a-comin', she 'peared all at on'ct—and where she was
                  bound, she threw her maintops'l aback, and a boat was lowered from her, and a crew
                  got into the boar and pulled right for the shore, opposite the boathouse. I know'd
                  then they was man-o'-war's men by the reg'lar sweep of the oars.</p>
               <p>"The boat grounded on the shore, just byyonder where that yawl is a lyin', and the
                  old man pointed to a yawl hauled up on the beach, high and dry, as he spoke; and
                  the cox'sn', as I thought—for there didn't seem to be no other officer on
                  board—sprang out on the beach, and came walking right up tow'rds me.</p>
               <p>"AS he came near, I seed as his toggery was all white and shinin'—such as a cox'n
                  don't often wear—and says I to myself, "that's some officer in disguise—he can't
                  blind an old hand like me—for you know, your reverence, I've often seen officers
                  disguise themselves in seamen's toggery. Charley Paget, when on the South-sea
                  station, often used to do so, at valparaiso; but, I thinks, 'what can he be a
                  wantin' with me?' When he got within a few yards of the boathouse, he put a
                  bo'swin's whistle to his lips, and piped a reg'lar call. 'Hallo!' I shouts, out o'
                  mere force o' habit.</p>
               <p>"'Jemmy Milton, ahoy!' he sings out in return; 'your roll's called aboard yonder
                  barky.'"</p>
               <p>"By this time he'd got close up to the boathouse, and I saw his features was those
                  of Bill Huntley, as used to be maintop-man aboard the Alert brig-o'-war when I was
                  folk's'l-man. He and I were chums, and a man and a seaman every inch was Bill, and
                  always serious and fond of talkin' of religious things. I wondered to see him
                  actin' the guy in that fine toggery, and I was agoin' to tell him so, when upon
                  lookin' closer at him, though his features was just like Bill's, he looked so
                  young and spruce, that I thought I was mistaken, for Bill was an old man when I
                  sailed with him, and this chap didn't look over twenty, and then, when he came
                  near, the white jacket and trousers he wore, shone so bright, that I could hardly
                  keep my eyes upon 'em they dazzled so.</p>
               <p>"'Hillo! Jimmy Milton,' says he, 'don't you know your old shipmate, Bill
                  Huntley?'</p>
               <p>"'Then I know'd it was him; and I told him that I knew him afore, but thought I
                  was mistaken on account of his fine clothes; for them, Bill,' says I, 'ain't such
                  slops as a main-top-man, or even a coxs'n sports.'</p>
               <p>"'Them's the garments,' says he, 'as every seaman aboard yonder bark wears, and
                  your name's down on the roll call. You're shipped A. B., and must go right
                  aboard.'</p>
               <p>"'You'll tell an old chum first,' says I, 'where you're bound, and what's the name
                  of the ship, and who the skipper is!'</p>
               <p>"'To be sure, old shipmate,' says he. 'The ship's name is the Dreadnought, and the
                  captain's name is Christian, and we're bound to Etarnity.'</p>
               <p>"'I never heard of such a port as that,' says I, not knowin' 'xactly what he
                  meant. 'Where's it laid down in the charts?'</p>
               <p>"'It ain't laid down in no arthly chart,' says he, in reply. 'Our skipper guides
                  us by the aid of a good conscience; and this here book,' says he, laying his hand
                  on that 'dentical Bible—'this here book's our 'pitome of navigation. But,' says
                  he, 'you must bear a hand aboard; the captain won't wait; he's hove aback a
                  purpose for you, and sent me to fetch<pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC7199-00000187"/>
                  you. I've been lookin' out for you a long time, Jemmy; ever since I shipped aboard
                  the craft myself, and that's a year ago and more.'</p>
               <p>"'Well,' says I, 'if so be as it must be so, I s'pose it must. What's the usage
                  aboard?'</p>
               <p>"'First rate,' says he. 'No purser's rations; no fatigue exercise. Watch and
                  watch, and all friendship and kindness among both officers and men.'</p>
               <p>"'I'm your man then,' says I, for something seemed to tell me as I must go. 'But
                  what about my kit? I can't go aboard among such a smart ship's company as that in
                  this here guise?'</p>
               <p>"'You'll have shinin' garments sarved out when you get's aboard,' says he, 'and
                  when you puts 'em on, you'll look as young as I do. We're all hale and hearty
                  aboard yon craft.'</p>
               <p>"I jumps up to go with him when I hears this, and wakes and finds that I'd got my
                  legs out o' bed, and was sitting right straight up. I had to call Tommy Nelson to
                  tuck me up in bed again. 'Now, your reverence, don't you think as there's a
                  meanin' and a moral in that dream?'</p>
               <p>"'The dream has no particular meaning,' said I. 'You had been listening yesterday
                  to Molly reading some of those tracts I gave her, written for seamen, and had
                  thought over them in your sleep, and mixed them up with some fanciful vagaries,
                  that's all.'</p>
               <p>"'For all that,' he replied, 'I think, sir, as it has both a meanin' and a
                  moral.'</p>
               <p>"'I b'lieve as its a summons to call me to t'other world. Howsomever, I thank you
                  for listenin' to me so patiently, and p'r'aps you'll read me a chapter till Molly
                  comes back?'</p>
               <p>"I did as he desired, and having read, at his own request, the 107th Psalm, always
                  a favorite chapter with the old man, I left him, as my sermon was only half
                  written, and I was anxious to finish it.</p>
               <p>"I had scarcely been an hour at home when Molly Nelson again called, bringing me
                  the intelligence of Jemmy Milton's death. It appeared that shortly after I left
                  him, the girl returned, and he asked her again to read the chapter I had just read
                  to him. When she had finished it, she asked him if she should read another; but
                  receiving no reply, she raised her head and saw that he was sitting upright and
                  stiff in his chair. She was frightened, and called to a fisherman who was near by,
                  who, going into the boat-house, found the old man dead."</p>
               <p>"It was a strange <foreign xml:lang="FRA">presentiment</foreign> of death," said
                  Gerald.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied the vicar, thoughtfully.</p>
               <p>The day after this conversation took place, the will was read, and its
                  requirements strictly compiled with. To this day the old boat-house on Herrington
                  beach is kept in good repair. At Christmas time six poor widows are still
                  recipients of Jemmy Milton's <foreign xml:lang="LAT">post-mortem</foreign> bounty;
                  but the ancient messmates of old Jemmy, who for some years annually met to
                  celebrate the anniversary of his death, have themselves all dropped into the
                  grave, and the thousand pounds, the interest of which was annually expended for
                  that purpose, has long since been divided amongst their widows and children.</p>
               <p>Jemmy wished to be buried on the beach beneath the cliff, and had expressed this
                  wish to the vicar, but the desire was overruled, the clergyman objecting to it
                  because the sea beach was not consecrated ground. He lies in Herrington
                  churchyard, and a plain head-stone alone marks the spot where lie interred the
                  mortal remains of one of the kindest hearted and most single minded of God's
                  creatures, for the old man had requested that no inscription, not even his name,
                  should be carved upon his tomb-stone.</p>
               <p>Peace to thy rest, good, kindly, honest Jimmy, and honor to thy memory. The evil
                  that men do lives after them, so has written England's chiefest bard. If this be
                  true indeed and if it be true also, that the good that men have done lies buried
                  with their bones, then little <emph>lives</emph> of thee, even in the memory of
                  those who knew thee best. But if oblivion does<pb n="374-375"
                     xml:id="VAC7199-00000188"/> not rest always, nor perhaps so often as the great
                  bard supposed, over the sepulchres of honest man, whether they ranked them high
                  amongst the world's dignitaries, or were humble and lowly, even as thou wert, then
                  hast thou a living memory, there, where thou wert known and loved, and years will
                  pass away, and years again, and still the widow's and the orphan's eye, whom thou
                  befriended in thy life, shall drop the tear of kindly recollection o'er thy
                  grave.</p>
               <p>Gerald, shortly after this conversation, quitted Herrington, nor did he ever meet
                  the worthy vicar again. Two years after old Jemmy Milton's death, Mr. Pearce was
                  gathered to his fathers. He had lived a long and useful life and his death was
                  lamented and felt to be a calamity by all the inhabitants of the parish whose
                  spiritual welfare he had cared for so long and with such earnest zeal.</p>
               <p>Dr. Knight, for aught I know, still lives; but if so, he must be very aged man;
                  may be, he has also passed into the grave and in him the poor have lost a friend
                  who cannot be readily replaced.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Ashley still conducts the mission school at Colombo; but he has long since
                  retired from the active duties of the school, his place being supplied by his
                  second son Henry. Frederick Ashley has obtained the grade of full surgeon in the
                  East India Company's service and when last heard from was expecting to be
                  appointed Superintendent of the Naval Hospital at Madras. Rumor also said that on
                  the day that he received that appointment, he was to lead to the altar the
                  accomplished daughter of a Madras judge, but this may be only an idle rumor. The
                  younger children of Mr. Ashley, all girls, are growing up to be fine young women,
                  and promise to be very pretty. So wrote Frederick to Gerald. If this be not a
                  brother's partiality, and they really are pretty, they will not be long without
                  eligible admirers in India. Mrs. Ashley, at last accounts was still living and in
                  tolerably good health, although beginning to feel the infirmities of age.</p>
               <p>Two years after George Craddock's marriage with Mary Barton, he wrote to Gerald,
                  from Calcutta. His father, he wrote, had just received the appointment of Resident
                  at Bangalore, and he and his wife were going to remove thither with him. George
                  furthermore wrote that it was not likely his father would ever leave India again,
                  nor should he leave the country while his father lived.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hoffmann lived to be a very old man. He attended the club regularly every
                  evening until within a few weeks of his death. It is not thought that he ever sent
                  a "venture abroad again, on speculation; but he often told the joke against
                  himself about Gerald's bad luck. He was quite partial to repeating it, and thought
                  it a most capital story, at which no one laughed more heartily than himself. But
                  the old man has now been dead several years.</p>
               <p>It was on the 21st of February, just twenty-four years, all but one day, since
                  Gerald Dalton had opened his eyes to this world, amidst all the din and tumult of
                  a New York celebration of the anniversary of Washington's birthday that Gerald and
                  Alice were seated by the fire in the parlor of their snug villa in New Hampshire.
                  A fine little boy of three or four weeks old, only, was nestling on Alice's bosom.
                  His mother looked delicate, but the bloom of health was returning to her cheek and
                  her eyes sparkled with love and happiness as she gazed alternately at the infant
                  in her arms and at her husband, whose arm encircled her waist.</p>
               <p>"To-morrow is the anniversary of Washington's birthday," said Gerald, after gazing
                  for some moments abstractedly at the fire sparkling in the grate.</p>
               <p>"And your birthday, dear Gerald," said Alice.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and suppose—since the boy <emph>would</emph> come into the world some weeks
                  before his father's and Washington's birth-day—that we have him christened
                  to-morrow, and call him George Washington Dalton. What do you think of that, for a
                  name, Alice?"</p>
               <p>"I like Gerald better," she replied, pressing her husband's hand.</p>
               <pb n="376-377 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC7199-00000189"/>
               <p>"Then let it be Gerald Washington if you like."</p>
               <p>"As you please," said Alice.</p>
               <p>"Then it is settled, and I hope he'll turn out to be as good a man as his
                  namesake."</p>
               <p>"Which namesake, Washington or his father?" said Alice, smiling.</p>
               <p>"As both his namesakes then, Madame sauce-box," replied Gerald. "I am glad to see
                  the roses returning to your cheek, my love," he added, "for I really ought to go
                  to Cuba; Alvero's last letter urged a speedy visit. If that offer to dispose of
                  the Regla estate be an advantageous one, we would do well to accept it and close
                  the bargain."</p>
               <p>"Cerainly," said Alice, "I hope our boy will not be such a wanderer as you—You
                  wandered over half the world before we were married, and I think you have been
                  wandering from home ever since."</p>
               <p>"On business only, love," said Gerald, kissing the cheek of his wife, "I could
                  always wish you to accompany me, but this time of course, it is impossible. But if
                  we can well our Cuban property, we can invest the money here to better advantage,
                  and I shall not be so often called from home."</p>
               <p>"Then I sincerely hope you will sell it," said Alice, earnestly, "I am content to
                  remain here; but I like to have you always with me."</p>
               <p>"And you do not wish again to return to England?"</p>
               <p>"No, my husband's home is mine—Where he is there would I be also."</p>
               <p>"Better, dearest, I have known greater happiness since I have been here than I
                  ever knew before."</p>
               <p>"Then, Alice, I will go once again to Cuba, and manage to dispose of the estates,
                  even if we have to suffer some little loss, and when I return, you shall never
                  have occasion again to taunt me with being a wanderer from home and you."</p>
               <p>More than ten years have elapsed since the birth of Gerald and Alice Dalton's
                  eldest boy—and six other children, boys and girls, all now living, all healthy and
                  hearty have blessed their union. The Cuban property was sold, and the proceeds of
                  the sale invested in American securities, from which, together with the rent from
                  the Ohio property, and the interest of the legacy bequeathed by Jemmy Milton,
                  Gerald enjoys an ample income. He is devoted to farming, and has introduced
                  several improvements in agriculture which his neighbors have followed with
                  success. Once, since he sold the Cuban estates he has been again to Europe—and
                  then Alice and the oldest boy accompanied him in his tour on the continent; but,
                  he has now settled down for life—so he says—and has resolved to make his own
                  homestead, or at the furthest, his own country—the boundary of his wanderings.</p>

               <p>THE WATCHMAN is designed to subserve a good purpose, and it will, doubtless,
                  effect its object. The characters are skillfully drawn and are remarkably
                  life-like, and the plot of the tale is of the most interesting description. The
                  moral it inculcates is, that eventual success awaits the efforts of those who
                  earnestly strive to do their duty to God and man. This book will be a fitting

            </p>
            <p>This story opens with a scene in New York only, only a few years ago, in which a
               brother and sister, the hero and the heroine of the story, are introduced by the
               lawyer, in a condition of honest poverty. He furnishes them with temporary
               employment, but subsequently loses sight of them until they are recalled to his
               recollection in consequence of his reading an advertisement respecting them in a
               Philadelphia newspaper. which hints that they are heirs to large property in England,
               as well as in the United State. With some difficulty the lawyer traces them out, and
               determines to take their case in hand; but for a long time his efforts are fruitless,
               in consequence of Jesuitical machinations, employed by some of the noble relatives of
               the brother and sister, who desire to get the property into the clutches of the
               Church. The young lady falls temporarily into the power of Jesuitical agents in this
               country, but is rescued just as she is on the point of being despatched to Italy, to
               be placed in a convent, through the compassion of a servant. Eventually they arrive
               in England, and the lawyer undertakes to watch over their interests, and at the same
               time obtains the assistance of an England lawyer of eminence.</p>
            <p>However, Jesuitical and aristocratic influence still prevail against them, and the
               two scoundrels, of the Quick, Gammon and Snap school, named "Gripes and Cheatem," are
               employed by their titled relatives to throw every obstacle in their way, and for a
               long time they succeed. At length, however truth prevails and the story ends
               happily.</p>
            <p>The narrative bears on the face of it an impress of truth; certainly the author has
               displayed a profound knowledge of human nature in all its phases, and without having
               his interest in the story weakened by any gross exaggeration or improbability, the
               reader, when he lays the book aside, will unconsciously think of the adage—"Truth is
               strange—stranger than Fiction!"</p>

                  recorded in which came under his own observation, and the characters are all drawn
                  from real life. The plot of the story is briefly this:—George, the Fourth of
                  England, when the Prince Regent, gave Henry Fitzherbert an estate from the Crown
                  Lands. The Prince's right to bestow lands were involved in dispute, and
                  Fitzherbert came to America, where he died. His two children, a son and daughter,
                  are the principals of the story, and after many vicissitudes and trials, through
                  the aid of the American lawyer, they were finally placed in possession of the
                  estate. The details and incidents of the story are of thrilling interest,
                  although, for obvious reasons, in certain instances, names, dates and localities
                  are changed; yet in one or two instances these are closely adhered to. The work

                  not lightly awarded. The book has been published in elegant form, suitable for a

            <p>BY WILLIAM E. S. WHITMAN.</p>
            <p>This is one of those highly interesting narratives which necessarily take a strong
               hold of the popular mind. It tells, in simple, truth-like terms, of the numerous
               struggles and disappointments to which the humble mechanic is subjected who has a
               large family dependent upon his unaided exertions for support. It shows how honest,
               patient, unwearied industry is sure of success at last in this country. Where perhaps
               labor holds a nobler position than it does in any other land. It is a story that will
               cheer the sinking hearts of the poor, and incline the rich to look more kindly upon
               the less fortunate in worldly matters. It will be read with equal interest by all
               classes, and by persons of all ages—and no one will lay the book aside without
               feeling that he has, morally speaking, benefited by its perusal.</p>
