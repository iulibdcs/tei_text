MZBBOTzPED BT L. JORNSONf AND CO. PHLADELPHA. PRINTED BY T. X. AND P. o. C OLLLS.   TATLES OF THE SOUTHERN BORDER. THE TEXAN VIRAGO AND THE TAILOR' OF GOTHAM. AUNT BECK was a character such as could have flourished only in Texas or Australia. She was a tall and large-framed woman, who, having come of Scotch and Irih parents, bore, in her rounded, yet iron-jawed face, a singufr union of that mischievous humour and stolid will which are the character- istics of the two races. We think it was evident enough when you met her eye, ,that Aunt Beck had never been born to exhibit, under any possible circumstances in this troublesome life, a very saintly degree of patience-for, find her in howsoever placid mood you might, there was still a certain sharpness in the twinkle of her humour which made your nerves creep. This may be an uncharitable conjecture of ours, since Texas (a few years after the Revolution) was by no means a hot-bed of the godly virtues; and, from all accounts, there had been little in the fortunes which pad befallen Aunt Beck to sweeten her temper, or cultiyate n her great devoutness of resignation.     :              ' A partial and plausible theory asserts that circumstances make men-and women, too, we suppose!-but we incline to 8           3 /     '),  &#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC8245-00000003"/> 4         THE TEXAN VIRAGO  the belief that such women as Aunt Beck make their own circumstances-or, rather, find such as are most congenial to their tempers.  She was one of those born to be despots-to rule with a tyrannous will whatever persons and conditions she might come in contact with; and though her fate had been a cruel one, yet misfortune had as little hardened her generous im- pulses as it had softened her domineering temper. But, she stood the best sponsor of her own character; for, though a "Ione woman in the world," she was known to be so remark- ably well able to answer for herself, that no heaven-daring ruffian of the wild frontier on which she lived ever presumed to cross questions with her in a way to, risk provoking an ex- periment of her hair-splitting skill with the pistol, a brace of which she carried where housewives usually carry the bunch of keys. ,For her log hut in the old town of Goliad--of bloody memory-was at this time the only tavern, and she found pistols more useful than keys in protecting her property, and keeping her rough customers in order. Indeed, it was perfectly understood that she ruled, with an iron hand, all who claimed the hospitalities of her roof- tree, and that from her despotic fiat there could be no ap. peal; for if the resort was to force, her ready hand and savage temper were nothing loath to .meet it; if the -tongue was to be the weapon, then hers was, beyond all possible competition, the bitterest and most abusive that ever wagged! Whatever of misfortune really had occurred, Aunt Beck's was a " silent sorrow ;" for she never spoke of her past life in connection with any of its affections; and that she had ever known those which are common to her sex at all, you could only discover in occasional and unconscious outhreaks of a tender impulse, which revealed the woman through the des- perado. But though she herself was sternly silent at all, times upon   AND THE TAILOR OF GOTHAM.       5 such themes, there were plenty of others who volunteered to talk for her, and it was a gloomy tale of utter desolation at which these whispering rumour-bearers hinted, in connection with her career in Texas.       . It was said that her husband was one of the early colonistsA With Austin, and that they had brought with them from the mountains of Pennsylvania a lusty family of sons--six stout and manly-looking fellows as ever drew "a bead" or slung an axe. -She never had a daughter--but her seventh and youngest boy was very feminine and delicate-unlike his six rough brothers as contrast could make him, both in appear- ance and in temper. Her mother's heart clung to this boy before all the rest, while her husband, who was a fierce and rude old ruffian, regarded him with contempt, and finally even a pitiless aversion as womanly and feeble. Until the birth of this unfortunate child the pair had got along together with as little difficulty and as few serious col- lisions as could be expected from natures which were mu- tually strong, tenacious, and- unyielding-that is, they had quarrelled now and then pretty savagely; but as they really loved and respected each other heartily, they had soon come together again, with a renewal of the affection which had only generated something of warmth in the separation. But now his slight form, and fair, pretty, girlish face, came- be- tween the contending powers, not as the angel of peace, but of discord. They lived amid perilous scenes, and the ruder virtues of brute strength and courage were more highly valued than all others, and while the old man rejoiced in the prowess and daring of his six stalwart boys, who were in every sense so useful and congenial in his lawless pursuits, the youngest be- came an eye-sore and a shame to him in their midst. Not that the boy had really shown himself to be deficient in manly spirit by any overt act as he grew up, but mainly be- cause he seemed to have no sympathy with their cherished  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC8245-00000004"/> 6         THE TEXAN VIRAGO moods of feeling and habitual deeds; for this the elder sons hated him, and aided to nourish the father's hate. The old man was a cattle-driver, or "cow-boy," as those men are -and were termed who drove in the cattle of the Mexican rancheros of the, Rio Grande border, either by stealth, or- after plundering or murdering the herdsmen! They were, in short, considered as banditti before the revo- lution, and have been properly considered so since. This term ' cow-boy" was even theni--and still more emphatically, later-one name for many crimes; since those engaged in it were mostly outlaws confessedly-and if not so at the-begin- ning, were always driven into outlawry by the harsh and stern contingencies of their pursuit, which, as it Was in violation of all law, compelled them frequently into the most heinous crimes, to protect themselves against entailed conse. quences. The predatory excursions of this man and his six boys had furnished one of the earliest occasions for the harsh measur es of the central government toward -the new colony of Texas, which led to the first collisions between them. The son, who was then sixteen years of' age, had always refused to accompany his father and brothers on these excur- sions, and, although he said little, had, in spite of their united taunts and insults, persisted in remaining by the side of his -mother. She had heretofore taken his part, and shielded him indirectly from these persecutions as quietly as possible for her impetuous nature. But now a crisis had ar- rived. i He was old enough to go with them and share in the hardships, as well as dangers and crimes of their expedi- tions; and the old man scornfully demanded that "the white- faced gal" should go along to cook for them, if he had not the spirit to do any thing else!  The boy, it seems, was of a delicate and poetical nature, and shrank, n0w more than ever, from the harsh and uncon- genial association of his father and brothers; for the dreams   AND THE TAILOR OF GOTHAM.       7 of a calmer and' nobler life, which had been nourished in him by the constant study of some few books which his mother had brought along with her, had now begun to take the warm complexion of reality; and, with an inherited firmness of will, they hadlbecome as laws and a fixed purpose to him. He refused positively to go, or to hold any thing in- com- mon with his father and brothers, and that with a resolution and tenacity which both surprised and astounded the old man, who had heretofore left him to himself and his mother with a -contemptuous disregard, never dreaming, of course, that he would have the insolence at any time to assert his life as his own. The reaction of his surprise was furious anger. He loosened upon the poor child's head the vials of his hoarded wrath, in words of the bitterest, the most brutal and savage denunciation. This was in the presence of all, the six brothers and the mother. The boy stood among them, white and firm: not a nerve quivered while he looked his father steadily in' the eye. This only enraged the old ruffian the more. He taunted him with the most merciless and even ferocious malignity-the boy's face merely grew whiter and more rigid. The brute now roared with anger, and cursed him in dreadful curses, and swore finally, with a hideous imprecation, that if the boy did not start with them the next morning, he would tie him up to a tree and lash his naked back with a quirt while he could stand, or there was life in him. "You will have it to do," said the child, calmly. "I won't go with you, old man!- I will stay with mother!" "You won't!-.won't you?" roared the old wretch, spring- ing forward. "Take that! and go to her then!" He struck him in the ungovernable paroxysm of his rage- - struck him on his fair and delicate temple a blow that would have felled an ox. The brave boy sank without a moan, the blood gushing from his eyes, nose, and mouth. The mother had stood by during the scene without offering  t   &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC8245-00000005"/> 8 v       THE TEXAN VIRAGO to interfere; she sprang forward, as she saw the blow about to be struck, to arrest her husband's arm; but it was too late. Her darling-the child of her heart-lay at her feet dead, the red blood streaming over his white face. The woman was gone-a raving tigress was in her place-an unnatural mon- ster! She sprang upon her husband, and before the sons could interfere, she had snatched the bowie knife from his own belt and cut him with a dozen mortal strokes; and then charging like a demon of blind retribution upon her elder sons, had scattered them with the bloody knife far and wide, several of them. badly wounded before they had time to realize all the horror of the awful and unnatural scene. They never dared go near her again. While pursuing them with the knife, she had screamed in their ears, in the broken language of her demoniac fury, that they had been the cause of the boy's death-that they had set their father on from thetfirst, and might have prevented him from strik- ing now if they had tried-that they had hated the boy be- cause he was betterthan themselves! They knew her too well ever to.' venture into her presence again, and, bad as they were, the- horror of that event made them worse and more desperate than ever; so that in a few years they were all killed off either in foray or fray along the border. Who shall speak the dark, unutterable wo of this fierce' -woman, thus left alone with the bodies of the-slain, and her own exhausted, reacting passion? She lived far away from any neighbours, and for several days nobody came to intrude upon her mournfully fearful solitude. When at last some of the neighbours gathered in--having heard the report of her sons--they found her busied about her house as usual, and when they asked her for her child and husband, she pointed in stern, silence to their graves, and harshy bade them go about their business. One of the party, a little more pertinacious or officious than the rest, insisted that something should be done in the %   AND THE TAILOR OF GOTHAM.       9 case, and that she should go in with them to Brazoria to be tried. TAe woman stepped back into her cabin, and bring- ing forward two guns, leaned one against the side of the door, while, with a grim relentless scowl upon her ghastly face, she ordered them to start, at the same time presenting the other gun at them. They were all armed of course, but they did not cnoose to bide the issue of such a contest, and that with a woman, too; so they left, and nobody ever dared to mention the event to her again. For more than a year it was believed no white # person went near her house, and that she did not- see a living soul, except the wild Indians, perhaps, who are said to have been frequently repulsed by her single hand, in attempts upon her property. Her house was then on an old trail which led into the Rio Grande border, somewhere in the neighbourhood of Mier. It bad formerly been traversed by the tobacco smugglers from the Sabine or the coast; but of late years it -had been dis- used, for fear of' the cow-boy depredations. Her husband and sons were said to have frequently robbed and murdered the companies of traders as they called -themselves--but really smugglers--along this trail; and now that they had disappeared, the bands of these equally lawless men began to make their appearance again along the trail, with their long trains of mules laden with bales of tobacco. These men were the earliest intruders upon her solitude, and a rough reception it was they met with at first. But these men are ^ merry and dare-devil class, and the laughing recklessness with which they braved her savageness at last won upon her to a certain degree, and she sullenly permitted them a sort of take-care-of-themselves hospitality. They, represented her appearance, when they first intruded upon her, as awfully hideous. She had been a fat and ruddy dame, with hair slightly grizzled, one year before; now she seemed tall and gaunt,  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC8245-00000006"/> 10  .      PTHE TEXAN VIRAGO and- her chalky skin was shrivelled to her bones. Her hair was a mass of creamy, unnatural-looking white, and her sunken eyes burned with a sultry sullenness that was appal- ling. After the first uncontrollable shudder, these men were either tpo brutal or too careless to pay any further regard to these appearances, and they knew her reputation rather too well to venture to speak of them in her presence. Their rude and boisterous mirth seemed to have an imme- diateeffect in rousing her life from the deadly lethargy into which it was sinking. They first awakened her anger furi- ously; and then, as that was permitted to exhaust itself in harmless vituperation upon them, her kindlier feelings be- came gradually aroused through the strongly-inherited mirth- fulness of her Irish descent. They say that when she finally broke out of a sudden in their midst into a loud laugh, they were frightened-that it had an unearthly sound; like the dry chatter of a skeleton's laugh. She checked herself sud- etanlys and glared around bher in a fury; but they, all looked so really startled and affrighted, that she burst again into a roar of spasmodic mirth, which continued, peal upon peal, until she sank hysterically upon the earth.; and after weep- ing for a long while there, she arose to her feet a changed being. The spell was broken! -           . She resumed a partial cheerfulness before they left, and when the party returned, they found her greatly altered in appearance, as she was in temper and bearing. She looked like a human being now, and met their rough greetings with something like good humour, though when they ventured upon some rude bantering, the savage tartness of her retorts warned- them to keep in due bounds. As time progressed, this class of outlaws became great favourites with her, and her house came to be a sort of frontier rendezvous for them. The year after she heard of the, death of the last of her sons, she undertook a pilgrimage to the Rio Grande, for the purpose of confession, penance, and absolution, at the great   AND THE TAILORF F GOTHAM.       1 cathedral of Monterey. She had been educated a Catholic, but, until the events of late years, had entirely forgotten her religion. The journey was a very perilous one, but she made it in company with one of those smuggling bands so far as the neighbourhood of Mier.- On parting with them she crossed the river above Mier, and rieported herself to. the Padre there, who,.believing her account of the object of her journey, gave her a permit to( travel, which he obtained from the Alcalde, and forwarded the pious pilgrim, with a strong escort, to his superior at Monte- rey-she, of course, leaving behind a heavy remembrance for his blessing.+ Returning with a conscience now entirely at ease, and a purse nearly as light, she rejoined the smugglers, and from that time until the revolution she was openly en- gaged herself in the smuggling trade, and even led her own little band of men and mules in person. Her journey to the confessional had given her all the advantages of information she desired, and she aviled herself of them in her awn ad- venturous manner. She spoke Mexican admirably, and as she now had the reputation of possessing a long purse, and, of course, great piety, it was easy enough for her, on pre- tence of relieving her sensitive conscience, to cross into any of the border towns, and, after feeing the priest heavily, ob- tain through him an interview with the Alcalde, who had to be feed again yet more l'evily for the privilege of intro- ducing her tobacco into the town during the night, concealed beneath carts of hay or other produce for the market. The permit or understanding being obtained, she would send back a trusty-Mexican servant to the camp-on the other side of the Rio Grande, in which she had left- her com- pany concealed-with directions where to cross, and at what hour. She would then meet them, having previously, with the zealous aid of her coadjutor, the worthy Alcalde, sent her smuggling convoy of carts or mules to the same point by many different routes. The tobacco being transferred to  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC8245-00000007"/> 12.        THE TEXAN VIRAGO these, they scattered again, and came in by the different -routes, mingled in with other market-carts or mules coming in from the country. The Alcalde was, of course, on hand, in the zealous dis- charge of his duty, which was, in part, to see that the revenue- laws were duly respected within the limits of his jurisdiction. The great man was unusually condescending that motnihg, and if he had not chosen-to take his officer-whose duty it was to inspect all loads and packs-into confidence, -and go shares of the plunder with him, he would so overwhelm that functionary by his astonishing and loquacious condescension, as- to completely distract his attention from his duty, and' thus permit the tobacco to pass in safely. Usually, however, there was no necessity for all this trouble. The Alcalde had only to send for his officer and get him drunk over night, and the tobacco would be safely enough housed before he awoke; or else, if he was a person he could entirely trust, he would merely convey the intelligence to him that he had a little speculation on foot, apnd desired that officer would wear his brown spectacles next morning, and this hint would, of course,f be understood; and when the tobacco was fairly out ' of harm's way, this obliging functionary was to be remem- bered by a third heavy disbursement. In spite of the entailed necessity for all these heavy out- lays-'and these are only the direct and legitimate ones, under the easiest possible conditions-the, trade was occa- sionally so very lucrative, that the smuggler dared every thing rather than give it up, though it was quite as common for -him to lose all as to make these enormous percentages. As, for instance, the Alcalde might be attacked with a sudden fit of indigestion, and, of course, of virtue and patriotic zeal-then his unpurchasable honour was dangerous, though by no means rash. He would take the purse of the tamperer with smothered indignation-assist him with well-dissembled activity to cross his tobacco-nay, even get it into the town, \    AND THE TAILOR OF GOTHAM.       13 and then, in a sudden fit of abstraction, inform his officer, privately, that the prey was in the net, and he would draw the strings at once. Consequence-forfeiture of the whole- seizure and imprisonment of the smuggler at the pleasure of the Alcalde. It was. the dfty of this virtuous person to forward such prisoners to Mexico, and of course account to the govern- ment for the forfeited property; but as his fit of indigestion would have passed off by this time, his ears were mercifully open to propositions for ransom from the friends of the cap- tive, and when a few thousand dollars more had been forth- coming, he would'permit his benevolent heart the gratifica- tion of freeing the poor prisoner, without a shirt to his back, while the government remained nothing the wiser of such' good deeds on the part of its distant servants. Sometimes it happened that the unfortunate adventurer never saw the light again, having been disposed of in some-mysterious way; and as there was nobody who dared come to inquire after him, nobody of course was any the wiser for his fate but the sleek Alcalde and his tractable ministers. Hard as were such contingencies, the smuggler no sooner escaped from the consequences of one than he risked another without fail. There seems to be a something of charm in the wild and perilous exigencies of such a life, which holds with it a strange power over those who have once felt its spell; no sort of danger, suffering, or defeat can deter them from a renewal of the attractive risks. Strange as it is that this should be so with men, it is yet more remarkable to find a lone woman persevering through years of perilous vicissitude in this traffic. -- She is represented to have passed through nearly every difficult strait to which the life of the tobacco-smuggler is liable, and indeed to have personally faced a greater amount and variety of dangerous extremes than any of the most noted "leaders of the other sex along the whole border. /  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC8245-00000008"/> "        TIE TEXAN vrRAGo There may have been some romancing in this st, Bment, as is natural from the unusual character of the circumstance that a 'woman should be engaged in such a traffic at all; but these few facts are known to be absolutely' certain, namely: that she was for a period of five or six years on horseback for three-fourths of her time, riding like a man, with pistols in her holsters before her, and at her belt-she never carried' a gun--and passing between her own house and the towns, of'the Rio Grande; that she usually had five or six men with her, one of whom was her Mexican servant, and a dozen or more pack-mules loaded with tobacco going out, and some with specie coming in; that -during this time she was fre- quently taken prisoner, and her men came straggling in without a mule or a penny; that she always came in alone on these occasions, and frequently made narrow escapes from, and had desperate fights with the Indians; that she never hesitated to go anywhere she chose, Indians or no In- dians, and did not seem to regard 'their being in her path at all, &amp;c. &amp;c, Such facts as these were notorious; and it was further whispered that she owed her frequent escapes to the power- ,ful intercession, or rather interference, of the Padres down along the valley from Monterey, who, it is said, held her in high regard for her piety, or rather her liberality to the church. I. t was also said that she *Was both feared and hated by the majority of the men-whom  she employed; but that she always had one or two about her who were faithful. On several eoccasions when they were returning, the men have attempted a mutiny, to get possession of the specie, by taking her life. She has always discovered the plot in time, and permitting it to come to a head, has killed, often with her own hands, the ringleaders.

She was by no means so old a person that such charges would not have been thought of and greedily circulated about her; but that there was a certain grave, stern, and reserved austerity, -which made itself so frequently apparent in her looks- and bearing, in spite of her humour and recklessness, that such thoughts were utterly rebuked, even in the minds of the most obscene blackguards. She is said, on one occasion, when near the Rio Grande, on her way out with tobacco, to have slit the ears of such a fellow, who said something in her presence offensive to her delicacy, and then driven him from her camp, without food or a gun, to find his way back as best he might. This was a lesson that lasted ever afterwards, when- ever she was present among men, of whatever stamp; for. such an incident as this has always wide circulation. At the time the revolution broke out, she was thought to be quith wealthy, and was engaged in smuggling, on a more - extensive scale than any one else in Texas. She had not much visible property, but her wealth was said to be all in gold and silver. Be this as it may, that event broke up her smuggling operations entirely, and she remained quiet at home, taking sides with neither party. But neutrality at such a time was out of the question, and her house was surrounded suddenly and pillaged by the blood-thirsty and brutal Cos. It is said that he carried off a large sum in specie, which he found concealed under the floor of her rancho. From that time she became a fierce and deadly foe of Mexico and Mexicans; and it turned out, that although Cos was said to have carried off all her money, she still had a great deal left to spare to the cause of Texas,  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC8245-00000009"/> 16         THE TEXAN VIRAGO She never did any thing ly halves, and so, by the time the war /was over, she found herself nearly penniless, and was compelled to begin the world anew. She had been hanging around the army, sometimes taking a hand, on a pinch; with her pistols, and at others cooking for the officers and attend- ing the wounded. Bu It when the 'army was finally disbanded, she went back to her old life of solitude again, but soon found that she could not live upon air; all her money was gone and her stock scattered to the four winds. She would not condescend to trouble the new government for repayment of the sums, she had advanced; but, with characteristic recklessness and energy, got together some few of the remaining men formerly in her employ, and then, making a sudden descent upon the distracted borders of Mexico, drove back a herd of five hun- dred head of cattle;-in a word, became -a female "Cow- boy," as her husband and elder sons had been! On reach- ing the settlements, the cattle were rapidly converted into money, although she did not- appear in the bIasiae, but acted through an agent. Having received the money, she is said to have declared her determination to alter her mode of life-quit adventur- ing, and settle down in quiet for the rest-of her life. That her ideas of quiet were decidedly comparative, will be per. ceived, when it is known that the deserted site of Goliad, of bloody memory, was the location ,of her new and quiet home. It was then the extreme frontier; of settlement west. The whites had been driven from Bahai, and the little settlement at Victoria was scattered; the country was filled with out- - laws--stragglers from both armies-the ravens of spoil and slaughter, that were starving now for: want of their unclean food. 'The Indians, taking advantage of the general confusion, were driving the settlers steadily back and back towards the Sand Bernard, and were constantly scouring the country back:   AND THE' TAILOR OF GOTHAM.       17 and forth in small predatory bands. It was in the midst of such a condition of things that our wearied and saintly her- mitess, sighing for the calm delights of peaceful seclusion, away from the harsh strife and wicked turmoil of an evil world, threw herself for the remainder of her days. She was the pioneer of resettlement, and took things as they came with a most philosophical resigfation. If -the Indians troubled her stock, she sallied out and gave them a drub- bing-if renegades and horse-thieves annoyed her, she dealt with them in an equally summary manner, and soon made her neighbourhood respected' to such a degree, that two or three adventurers from the settlements plucked up courage, and' came to live in deserted tenements of the old town. If any one came who did not suit her, she soon drove him off with a flea in his ear. Thus several years had passed, and though there were'still not more than a half dozen others in the town, yet the Old Trail to Bahai had begun to be travelled now and then, and the little .ettlement at Victoria had--begun to gather in again, and Aunt Beck was not unfrequently called upon by land-hunters,; travellers, speculators, and so forth, for food and lodging-so she concluded, as the thing became inevita- ble, to give in and "keep tavern" at once. About this time my friend Dick Hord, a wild and gallant young Virginian, went to Texas to seek his fortune. He was reckless as exuberant life and a mirthful and dare-devil spirit could make him; buty et he had a sober purpose before him--that is, he protests that he had-but we have always thought that he obtained the commission of surveyor of Goliad county rather as an excuse for running himself into all sorts of scrapes and hair-breadth ventures, rather than-with the thrifty view of locating the best lands' for himself, and thereby laying the foundation for a fortune. Be this as it may, thie best proof of his being a sad scamp is to be found in the incident we are about to relate.

Dick and she got along surprisingly together; for there was *something in the cool matter-of-fact way in which lie pushed his surveying or hunting expeditions right into known Indian territory without the slightest regard to their numbers or formidable" -fame--whic4 quite won Aunt Beck's heart-because it was so much after her own habitual mode of procedure. Dick had been living this wandering and adventurous life for over a year, when the monotony of its seclusion began to be somewhat relieved. Young men were flooding into Texas from every State in the Union-their pockets stuffed with "Iand scrip," the most of which was located on some imagi- nary grant on the remote frontier. . The mania for specula- -tion, which was the first reaction from the depressing times of the revolution, had scattered this worthless paper far and -wide, and many a clever, warm-hearted fellow had, been gulled by the oily-tongued agents of those irresponsible com- panies into giving up a valuable certainty at home to chase the wild goose that was to lay him golden eggs over those desolate and dangerous plains. These verdant and eager adventurers had begun to push their way as far as Goliad; and sometimes when Dick came in he would find a party waiting his arrival at Aunt Beck's tavern, to go with them and survey these " promised lands." On -the occasion to which we shall particularly refer, he -found two young men who had just arrived from "the States," and were anxiously awaiting him. One of them, named Allen, was a plainly dressed, bright-eyed youth, who said he was a farmer's son from Tennessee; while the other was a heroic tailor of Gotham, who had dropped one goose to chase another. The usual frank and rough greeting of the frontier being over,; these men, together with Dick and his two chain- *        ,;'   AND THE TAILOR OF GOTHAM.       19 carriers, were soon seated at dinner around an old pine dry- goods box, which served them for-a table. In the tentre of this stood a large wooden bowl, filled with a boiling hotch- potch of beef and potatoes. A tin pint cup flanked the pewter plate which was in front of each man. There was no sign of spoons, and the two strangers looked with- a puzzled and hungry curiosity at the contents of the bowrl, when Dick laughingly drew Shis hunting-knife and commenced spearing vigorously at the potatoes and fragments of meat which were bobbing about in the hot and muddy-looking pool. They took the hint and followed suit,.while Aunt Beck- her strong features flaming from  the heat of the ire- walked round behind them, filling each cup with coffee from a great black tin boiler. Aunt Beck was usually sulky or -tart when strangers came; but for a miracle she was in a rare good-humour this evening. "There! there!"-as she was running his cup over in her generosity--" you mean I shall have enough this evening, Aunty?"        '  "Sure and yes, hinney! ye should be afther ateing enough while ye've the conveniences and the bowels!" "But Aunty, I say!-though I may not always have just such luxurious conveniences at hand as you furnish here, yet I don't know what's to spoil my appetite." "Ah, chiel Dicky!

This was said with demure solemnity, and a side wink at Dick. , ' "I hope they won't take a fancy for mine!" said the Ten- nessee boy, very -innocently smoothing down his shining black locks. 'By blood!" said the knight of the scissors, with a hoarsely savage intonation, stroking rapidly, at the same time, a huge moustache, "if they get mine, they'll have to fight for it, by G-d!" Aunt Beck stared at him with round, opening eyes for an instant; then, lifting her hands as if in pious adjuration'- "Lord help us!--a lone creetur!-how fierce he is! Sae they will, mon, nae doubt.

"Oh, I am quite- tender-hearted, as to that," said he of the whiskers, shaking his head to one side, and putting on a ferocious scowl, which clearly contradicted his words.

This was too rich. Dick and his chain-bearers, who had been nearly bursting with smothered merriment since this conversation began, now exploded in the most uproarious peals of laughter as they jumped from their seats and tum- bled convulsed about the room. Young Allen, who had be- gun to smell the rat, joined the laugh, but with more mode- ration; for he had not seen enough of life, and such life especially, to exactly understand the characters about him. The astonished tailor drew himself up to his full height; then opening his big white eyes in a wild stare around him for a moment, assumed a lofty air of sneering indignation as he threw out -his right arm towards the offenders grandly, and hissed:from between his teeth- "Ye-s-es, old woman!     Do you just show Hector Napoleon Smith one of those bloody Camanches you seem to be so 'fraid of, if you want to see whether he is done with his suck-bottle or no!" "Dicky!'Dicky, dear!" screamed the old woman, "where's  your pet Camancha? Let's show it to my darlin'." "You mean in the cigar-box? , There it is on the -shelf, outside the door." Aunt Beck bounced out of the door, and in an instant was back, holding a cigar-box in her hands, with narrow strips tacked on the front. She pushed it towards the face of Hector Napoleon Smith. "There, deary!   Don't faint, now. That's a Camancha! Wouldn't you like to eat him without salt?" I-Hector Napoleon sprang back, amidst reiterated peals of laughter. He  looked frightened-no wonder!-for it was one of those famously hideous and loathsome. creatures of the  southern prairies called horned frogs, and which she had named her pet Camancha.  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC8245-00000012"/> 22        TRE TEXAN VIRAGO ( Wihat is it ,'. he -gasped. "Take it away, woman!" ButAunt Beck still followed&amp; his retreating steps, pushing the box under his nose until it touched his face. He struck the frog-cage aside, and pushed her rudely from him, as he roared out furiously-- "Get awat, you, d---d old hag 1" "D --d old hag, is it?--you moon-eyed spalpeen! Take that I and that!"Heavy and fast she rained the blows upon hs head with the cigar-box, until it split into a thousand fragments, while she continued to repeat "D--d old. hag, is it?" every time her heavy hand came down; and then-- "-The mither that suckled a calf sha'nVt ken ye!" Her quick eye detected the poor frog attempting to escape along the floor of the cabin. Springing after it with wonder- ful activity, she seized it in her fingers, turned, and advanced upon the poor tailor with the exclamation-   ; "By the ghost of St.- Patrick, he shall ate the Ca- manch!"-' But Hector Napoleon Smith had- availed himself of the short respite to seize a heavy stool by the leg, and throw himself upon the defensive, with his weapon upraised to strike. The expression of the old woman, which had been merely that of mischievous deviltry before, changed now to one of pitiless fierceness: she put her hand beneath her aproh: and, whipped out a pistol quickly; then, laughing harshy as she presented it at his head- "Down, with it! ye terrier-faced cummudgeon! In my ain house, too!"  The arm of the affrighted fellow dropped to his side, and the stool fell to the floor. Looking somewhat mollified by this prompt obedience, she approached as he shrunk cower- ing back into a corner, with a most ludicrously gracious and winning-leer upon her face-      - "Aisy, my dear, aisy! Sac bluid-thirsty a chiel as ye shall ha' it to say he's ate a Camancha without salt!," and   AND THE TAILOR OF GOTHAM.       23 she pushed the frog nearer his mouth, which he endeavoured to shield--by throwing his arms pitifully across his face. "Hut! tut! nae scringin', my bonnie pet! . Bite--awa bravely! Bite awa!" pushing it up still closer to his mouth. "Good God!" groaned the agonized tailor, rolling his eyes about him, with a wild look of forlorn, imploring de- spair-for the -filthy reptile almost touched his lips, and the muzzle of the pistol gaped like a cannon's mouth before his swimming vision. ) "Ye'll ha' it to do!" said the inexorable old creature, still following his shrinking face with the frog. But the joke hid gone far enough, and Dick, who by-this time had sufficiently recovered from his convulsions, came to the poor wretch's rescue, and snatched the pistol from the old woman's hand, as he pushed her suddenly back. Thus was the horrified tailor relieved, though the experiment might have cost any other man a pistol-ball; but Dick'was her favourite, and after abusing him a little, she joined good- humouredly in the continued laughter, saying, as she" turned( off about her housework- "Sure, I'm a thinkin the dear chiel will na forget his first taste o' Camanches soon-!" They now resumed their seats, to finish the meal that had been so farsically interrupted. Hector Napoleon looked considerably chop-fallen for awhile.. But Dick, who now suddenly conceived a warm interest for him, consoled him by exclaiming, in an emphatic whisper- "4Pshaw! never mind it  she's nothing but a woman! What man could help himself?--you were obliged to stand it, or strike a woman!3' Perceiving that this sort of consolation 'took admirably, he proceeded to launch out for quantity with a string of direful stories, illustrating, in highly-imaginative colouring, the desperate and blood-thirsty traits of the Camanches. This sort of rigmarole romancing was addressed to the tailor  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC8245-00000013"/> 24        THE TEXAN VIRAGO in a low,- confidential voice, as a man of tried valour, to whom such scenes were matters of course. Now and then, in winding up some story in which cowardice had -lost the day, he would exclaim, in the most confident and enthusiastic manner---  "Ah! that affair would have ended very differently, had you and myself been only there! wouldn't it?" and soon he had the satisfaction of seeing his victim caress the moustache as. affectionately as ever, and nod his head threateningly in the affirmative, as he would drawlsout, with the most irre- sistibly imposing nonchalance--"I ra-a-a-ther think it would." This was exquisitely rich to Dick's palate; for not having. the slightest idea of seeing 'Camanches really, he had deter- mined to amuse himself, in crossing the prairies to-morrow, 'by playing -upon the vain-glorious valour and ignorance of the tailor. He accordingly followed up the " stuffing" game, until, before they took to their blankets for the night, Hector Napoleon Smith was panting for the battle-field-for deeds of gory heroism and immortal daring, to be perpetrated at the expense of the dusky skins of the poor Camanches.  It seemed that the tailor and the young Tennesseean had come together by accident, both being on their way to Goliad on the same errand-namely, to get lands surveyed, for which they had bought scrip purporting to be located there. Dick, found the'scrip of young Allen really of value, though he had some doubts of that of the tailor. He started next morning, soon after sunrise, to survey Allen's land. Hector Napoleon, of course, accompanied them; and as they were mounting to start, Aunt Beck came to the door and screamed after him- "Arrah, hinney! and had'nt ye better take some salt along, to-day, to put on their tails! - Camanches is hard to catch--they're a wee bit Wild on the prairies, dear!" The tailor, who did not seem to think there was any great savour of the attic in this sort of wit, merely muttered some-   AND THE TAILOR OF GOTHAM.   '   25 thing about a "d    dold she-bear!" and started off into a gallop.      ' Dick continued the game of last night, and amused him- self by stimulating, with approving flattery, the surplus valour of Smith. When he would get up a false alarm nodl and then, he would praise the firm bearing of the valorous tailor, and hint how fiercely he knew he would have charged "nto them, had they turned oAt to be Indians. He thus worked the fellow up until he became more and more bombastically heroic, as they progressed with impunity, and would now and then let off steam by dashing his horse ahead of the party, jerking his gun to his face, and eyeing along the barrel at imaginary Camanches., Indeed, to all appearances, he was " crazy for a fight."      r Dick, who was a good-hearted fellow, wished from his very core that the enthusiastic young gentleman might be gratified; but as there seemed to him to be no prospect of this, he soon grew tired, chuckling at the effects of his own mischievous wit. It was time for business, for they were now in sight of the line of timber in which the land lay. He now, for the first time, turned his attention to it; and on looking at his com- pass, found, to his great mortification, that an indispensable screw of the instrument was missing. There was nothing left but to gallop back to the cabin and get it, where he sup- posed he must have left it. He pointed out a bend in the line of timber to the young men, as the place where the land lay, and told them either to go back with him, or pro- ceed themselves to the land and ride over it until his return. The chain-carriers had not come out, for the young men were to carry the chain themselves. The tailor looked a little wild at this proposition to go on there alone with Allen; but the young Western man, who had become wonderfully cool and self-possessed by this time, said at once- "Certainly, Mr. Herd! I will ride. on and take a good  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC8245-00000014"/> 26    .    THE TEXAN VIRAGO look at the land, while you go back!" and without waiting to hear from the tailo,-rode on-as a matter of course. They proceeded quite leisurely. The hero was in a very fidgety, restless mood, talking incessantly, while Allen paid little attention to him, but regarded with great curiosity the beautiful scenery they were approaching. They were now skirting up the timber towards the sharp elbow, or bend in the stream, which it,bordered. Like all the small streams of. Texas, this was a deep and narrow cut. Immediately on its brink the timber was small and brushy, Iit farther out into the prairie it grew larger and more scattering, until there was only here and there a great live-oak to dot its -surface. They turned the sharp bend, which it happened was a point of thicker wQods, and found themselves entering a lovely nook of meadow, with these old live-oaks scattered at intervals over it. Two horses, with lariats about their necks, were quietly grazing among the -trees, a short-distance from them. They stopped in astonishment, which was not a little increased when two Indians, who had evidently been lying upon the grass near the horses, asleep, sprang suddenly to their feet with a hoarse ejaculation of surprise. They were the dreaded Camanches! The young men were nearly between them and their horses. . This, together with the sudden awaking, seemed to confuse the warriors for a mo- ment. It was but for a moment, when one of them darted- for the cover of a tree which was nearer the horses, while the other glided behind that beneath which they were sleeping.     I Both parties were too much surprised, at first, to think of using weapons, though, with the prompt instinct of his West- ern blood, young Allen's rifle was up to his face very quickly, but just in time to be too late for the quick Indians. Seeing the advantage they had gained, he immediately dismounted and took the nearest tree himself; for on looking behind, he   AND THE TAILOR OF GOTHAM.      27 had perceived at a glance that there was nothing to hope from the tailor in charging them. That heroic person, in the meantime, was sitting stock-still and erect upon his horse, with. mouth and eyes stretched to their utmost capacity of extension--staring before him in blank, stupid astonishment. One of the warriors waked him from his stupor very suddenly with an arrow, which glided through the hairy thicket about his throat, and ripped up the flesh considerably.- With a quick sound, something between * a yelp and a roar, the fellow fell from his horse into the grass, and commenced rolling over and over until he reached the tree behind which Allen was sheltered. He paid no attention, but fired. Thei keen ring of his rifle echoed through the woods on the stream. The reply to it was an Indian whoop from the same quarter. The Indian he had fired at fell, but at the same moment the other sprang to a tree still nearer to the horses, and answered the whoop from the woods. The horses of the young men had by this time joined those of the Indians, and the rustling in the woods near; and the whistle and patter of arrows around him, told Allen that re- inforoements had- arrived. Things began to look serious,-but the young man only became more cool. He nudged the tailor with his elbow, while he waa loading his rifle, and told him to keep a sharp eye upon those fellows in ths bush, and fire at the first he saw; but he would pay no attention to him, and lay upon the ground moaning about the scratch in the neck he had received. There was no time to be lost, anid Allen, utterly out of patience, drew one of his pistols, and rapping the terrified noodle sharply over the head, muttered a threat to give him the ball instantly if he did not raise himself and watch those Indians in the bush behind them. The doubly terrified fellow now rose on his elbow, and aB five or six Indians boldly showed themselves above the bank,  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC8245-00000015"/> 28        THE TEXAN VIRAGO he shut his eyes and fired. It chanced that the shot told, and they jumped down again. Allen, in the mean- time, had drawn himself round the tree, somewhat out of the range of those fellows behind, and had given his whole attention to watching the warrior in front of him, who was determined to get to the horses. Allen and the warrior were warily watching each other, when, his attention being slightly attracted to szee the effect of the tailor's fire, the warrior took advantage of this to reach another tree, which placed him within a few paces of the horses. Allen immediately shifted his ground, too, and :was wounded in doing so by those behind. But the wound was slight, and he could now cover perfectly the space yet to be passed by his subtle foe. All was, now as still as death for a few moments. The tailor had forgotten the other barrel of his gun, and crouched panting at the foot of the tree, in overwhelming terror at finding himself thus left alone.' The Indians behind the bank had changed their tactics, and proceeding farther down under the shelter of the bank, took to the trees in the mea- dows; and the frightened booby saw ten or twelve dusky figures gliding from tree to tree, and rapidly closing around him. Remembering, in his despair, that he had a secohd barrel, he fired it wildly towards them, and then throwing his gun away, made with frantid speed for the stream they had just left. With half a dozen arrows sticking in his body, he tum- bled headlong over the- bank into the water, and this was the last seen of Hector Napoleon Smith, the heroic tailor--on this 'occasion at least; for if the arrows did not finish him, -he probably sank in the quicksands of the stream. The Indians, when they saw this, extraordinary manoeuvre, rushed forward towards Allen and the horses with a yell of, triumph, which, however, was cut short by the crack of his   AND THE TAILOR OF GOTHAM.       29 rifle and the death-shriek of the warrior in front, who tumbled over among the horses.. Allen's load was out, and they rushed at him again, think- ing they had him -now for a surety; but he ran as hard as he could for the horses, and succeeded in mounting- into his own saiddle while they were yet thirty paces behind him. He might now have made his escape with ease, but the Indian- fighting blood of the gallant youth was up, and he determined to carry off the horses too. He shot down the foremost In- 'dian with his pistol, and while the rest retreated behind trees, he started off the three best horses into A gallop. It seems that there was a -large party of Camanches camped on the other side of the stream, which, -like many others of the country, was impassable, except at particular points, on account of the quicksands through which it passed. The crossing-place was a mile above where the collision had occurred, and those who had shown themselves after it had commenced, had left their horses on the other side, and crossed to the assistance of their companions, on a log, while a larger party had gallopped up to the' crossing-place, and they now made their appearancej thundering down upon Allen at full speed, yelling their hoarse war-whoop, and clat- tering their lances against their shields. This was a sight one would think formidable enough to shake the cast-iron nerves of a veteran Indian-fighter. But, no! Allen had sworn to carry off those horses with him as trophies.  He had got a taste of Indian-fighting, and found it to suit him; so he coolly took his measres to accomplish his purpose, in the -face of all these foes. It was too late to run now, at all events! Reining up his horse a little to finish loading his gun, he then let them have his other pistol so soon as they Game in range, and as that set a warrior to reeling in his saddle, it somewhat checked their headlong career. He now threw down his pistol, and drew his gun deliberately to his face. ' o  .  ' *              ,    .

They now commenced riding- round him in a rapid..circle, so as to confihe his aim, but closing up closer with every round, so as to get, imperceptibly, within reach of him for their arrows. Though .this was his first fight;, he had yet listened with such strict attention to Dick's stories, that he had a pretty clear idea of the Camanche mode of fighting, and how experienced frontiersmen managed them at odds. He had learned that they never close upon a man so long as they know his rifle is loaded,; so he started on Mis three horses, and;wheniever they had closed up closer than -he liked, he would pause, and bring his rifle slowly to his face. They would instantly dive behind their horses, and wheeling, scatter out of reach of the ball. Then hewould push on again for a little distance, when the manoeuvre would be re- peated on both sides. His object was to drive the horse into -a mott, or island of timber, he sawgabout a mile before him on the prairie. All the timber near him was in possession of the Indians on foot; and he thought, as the mott was small, that he would be able to make good -his stand in it until Dick returned. But they saw his object, -and, the Indians on foot left the timber and r   made for the mott to cut him off; while those on horseback redoubled desperately their efforts to confuse him and draw his fire harmlessly. They throke up their line, and commenced dashing, with marvellous rapidity and the most hideous yells, back and forth, here and there, before and behind him, and would -even sweep past him,-though going like the wind--close enough -to hit either his horses or himself. This maddened his horses, and they grew unruly.

The arrows had begun to come faster and faster, as they grew emboldened by'the success of the new manoeuvre, and now they flew thick as hail stones about,' and a number of them struck him, but came from too great a distance to be fatal. Their movements were so swift, that by the time he had concluded upon firing at a particular Indian, he would have passed out of reach, or else an arrow from behind would tap him and distract his aim. His horse was deeply wounded. He saw, at last, that there was no hope of getting to the, mott alive, and desperately threw himself from the tottering animal, determined to make a breastwork ofits body, and sell his life as dearly as possible. The Indians swooped at him like hawks upon the stoop, and were nearly upon him when his feet touched the ground. There was no time for parleying now! He fired steadily, and brought down the foremost warrior. At the crack of the rifle they swerved back a little, but it was only for an in- stant-they rushed at him with ferocious yells; for now they were sure of him with his empty gun. The gallant boy was panting from loss of blood; but with set teeth he clubbed his gun desperately for one more blow before he died, when suddenly there rang upon his fading senses-bang! bang! bang!-a number of guns-a tremen- dous shouting and trampling-when he sank to the ground insensible. The"Indians, who were in the very act of plunging a dozen lances in his body, were scattered as if a hurricane had struck them, and Aunt Beck, with Dick and the chain-car- riers, their horses foaming with speed, leaped over him as they swept on in pursuit of the flying Camanches. All was oblivion with young Allen now, and until some time after, when a sudden sense of cold water in his face re- vived him. The men were standing in a group around him  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC8245-00000017"/> 382   -    THE tEXAN VIRAGO as he opened his eyes; and Aunt Beck stooped over him to bathe his temples from a water-gourd. "By the ghost of St. Patrick, the little bantam is only "stunned!" said she, as he opened his eyes. "Sure it's cock- a-doodle-doo ye may now, my bonny game-chick; for it's -bravely ye'r fleshed your spurs to-day!" she continued, as she patted him affectionately on the cheek with her rough powder-stained hands.. We took Allen to Aunt Beck's tavern, where she nursed him as tenderly as -she knew how; for the little Tennessee bantam had completely won her heart. Indeed, during the weary and almost desperate illness which followed, the cha- racter of Aunt Beck appeared in a new light. 'She watched by the bed of this youth with all the eager - and yearning watchfulness of the most affectionate mother; for a long-silent chord appeared to have been once more touched in her rude bosom, and her youngest-her fair boy-- the child of her heart, seemed to be replaced by this young stranger, and the hard and fierce virago was subdued once more into the woman. She clung to young Allen ever afterwards with such extra- ordinary and boundless affection, that he could never bring himself to leave her. His parents were no longer alive; and she adopted him, and, relinquishing entirely her masculine pursuits, settled down into the comparatively mild, certainly superlatively pains-taking and careful housewife, and all for the sake of her little Tennessee bantam, as she sometimes called him ever after. Allen recovered the- money she had loaned the Texas X government, and she gaveqit to him; whereupon he prospered a greatly, and is now a distinguished man in the new State. Dick and he continue. warm friends to this day. Several days after the fight, a haggard, ghastly wretch- -who, as Aunt Beck said, "looked like a ghost playing boo- peep through a hole in a bear-skin!"-came crawling up to ,   AND THE TAILOR OF GOTHAM.      33 the door of "The Tavern," and begged a morsel of food in God's name. After some difficulty they recognised the poor rascal Smith. He had, it seemed, sunk in the quicksand, but had managed to sustain himself by a drooping limb or twig;. and then, after all was quiet, had dragged himself out by its aid. Starvat'on, and the long cold bath he was compelied to take, -had prevented his wounds -from killing him. How he managed to get back in his weakened condition nobody can tell, not even himself. The old woman, at the solicitation of Dick, took care of him until he recovered his strength. But Hector Napoleon Smith was "a done-over tailor!" His two experiences of Camanches quite sufficed him; and with a very humble opinion of himself, Texas in general, and Aunt Beek's tongue in particular, he mounted his horse one fine morning with the intention of putting as much earth and water as possible between himself and such "- dem'd peculiar doing!"

THE time of Secret Societies is not yet passed-at all events, we believe that many of them still continue to exert a wide and powerful influence, little realized in our- common- place world.- It is too much the outward manner of the times to sneer at the power of confederacies, though they are feared-nay, dreaded-with a peculiar sort of vehemence, and frequently even with superstition. We mean to assert nothing disrespectful of such institu- tions in general, and of their results in particular; for we do believe that, in spite of the Inquisition, they- have been most important agents and means of progress. The deepest truths must come out of the heart of the world, whence they are worked up by the pale and begrimed miners of thought, towards the surface, until the ruddy children of the sun can grasp them, and they become, in their robust hands, REALITIES! So with the principle of these Societies generally. The object to be attained is most usually what is called a romantic or impracticable one, and, of course, not strictly orthodox- therefore, secrecy may be required to prevent controversy. In a word, we do not undertake to'defend such organizations, but simply to assert their existence in much greater numbers and power than men are generally disposed to believe; and, whether for evil or f6r good, their tremendous influence upon the times. 34   DEATH OF LITTLE RED-HEAD.       35 Most of the pretended revelations with regard to them have been proven to be false, and, of course, from the very theory of their principle, we can only really know of them by their effects. It is exclusively from, such a. point of view that we would presume to speak. Such Societies have existed, and do exist among us, and, as elsewhere, have exerted, and do exert a most extended influence. The distance and division between North and South have been more felt than expressed through such organizations than otherwise-therefore, it is with effects that we propose to deal in this narrative, rather than causes, which we must beg leave to have in a great measure inferred! . Years ago, before Texas was known as more than a wild province of Mexico, there existed an extensive and powerful association within the limits of our own territory, the opera- tions of which were extended to a greater distance than was dreamed of by many of the most able and shrewd men of the day. It is unnecessary to particularize further the motives and methods of such an institution, than to say that it was founded in a grasping, stern, but deep intelligence, and had for its objects what, at that time, would have been considered merely vague and wildly impossible schemes of territorial acquisition, which, having been suggested by the most boldly unprincipled man our country has produced, have been perpetuated by some of its most able, since, to a dazzling consummation. We cannot reveal more than glimpses of the methods pursued, and that rather by implica- tion than by explanation. It suffices to say, that young men were in some demand by them-but that they were young men of peculiar character. Agents, everywhere in the principal cities, such as New York and New Orleans particularly, kept their treacherous eyes secretly upon the movements of such young men as made themselves conspicuous for spirit, and were known to be of good families and education. The more dissolute the :f    10  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC8245-00000019"/> 86    j  DEATH O- LITTLE RED-HEAD. better, so they were truly courageous. There was use for such men towards the-South, and many such were redeemed from gambling hells or dragged from the stews by a power of which they knew nothing but its munificence and its impe- rious' dictation., Mark Catesby was a man capable of much that was both good and evil, as are all those wlio are capable of any thing worth mentioning. His family was good; his father, a 'wealthy Englishman, had brought over his property to this l country, along with his prejudices and habits. He had set- tled in New York, as metropolitan, and lived in lordly style. He was ^munificent as he was haughty, and had one vice which soon told upon a large estate. He gambled desperately, and died with the reputation of great wealth, leaving his son to inherit both his vices and his insolvency. The son inherited both his vices and his virtues; but a poor sister was all that was left now to love. He became pmore reckless than before, after the last blow that took from the two their only surviving relation on the continent, and, - in the heat -of wine,-made a heavy bet that ruined him -utterly. His sister was an- accomplished artist, and surveyed with comparative calmness the wreck of every thing, and bravely struggled' to uphold the brother who was so dear to her. He was a reckless young man, haughty to excess, anal filled with a blind family pride. When the great misfortune had been fully realized by them both, it was finally deter- mined, amidst his despair, through the advice of their old family lawyer, that the young man should commence the practice of a profession he had studied with effect-the law. The brave young sister persuaded- him too, after a long struggle, to permit her to trust her own support to her pencil. Such were the determinations on all sides, when a myste- rious intervention came to give a new direction to events. A   DEATH OF LITTLE RED-HEAD,       7 : duel, attended with shocking and fatal results, occurred. -It had grown out of the gambling debts of Mark, and of course left the already gloomy condition of taings involved in still greater gloom. He was not a party, jut the cause; and as neither party survived, he alone was left to bear the blame. To take the most reasonable view of the case, as Mark was the only person left, immediately accessory to the fact, all the public indignation and regrets were visited upon his devoted head. He was denounced in every way, and shamefully perse. cuted by the press, until his frank and sagacious friend, the "old family lawyer, advised him, by all means, to go from the city, and commence a career somewhere else, under more favourable auspices. Although the good old man was willing to do any thing in his power, or within the' limit of his means, to assist the son of his formerly munificent patron, yet the truth was, that his own benevolent habits had. so  straitened his resources, that he could do little more than advise. It was under these circumstances that Mark one day re- ceived, to his great astonishment, a letter containing a draft for a considerable sum. The letter bore the city post-mark, and-gave no explanation, further than the words:-- "Go to New Orleans; a good practice awaits you. Be silent, and you shall hear again." The sum was sufficient to rescue him from his embarrass-' ments, and to leave his sister in comfort; but yet this myste- rious donation both shocked his pride and roused his anger. What could it mean? Whoi should dare insult a Catesby by the offer of such a gift? He was not yet so poor as that! and he threw down the letter in a burst of rage and rushed out of the house. Hi's sister heard hig hurried exit, and, entering his room, picked up the letter and draft from the floor. The moment she saw the signature, which was only  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC8245-00000020"/> 38      DEATH OF LITTLE IRED-HEAD. "Regulus," her face blanched, her eyes shot fire, and she sank upon an ottoman. J A shudder ran. through her frame, her lids drooped, and for several hours she sat motionless, with her hands clasped before -her, while tear after tear coursed each' other down her cheeks. But now the silent struggle was over. She rose with a deep sigh, as her brother's hurried ring vas- heard, and, taking up the papers, met him in the parlour. He was much flushed, and deeply excited. She took his hand calmly, and led him to the sofa, still holding the papers in her hand. What was the purport of the long and earnest conversation of these two young persons, we are not prepared at present to reveal. The result was, that the draft was cashed--the sister established as an artist in neat rooms on Broadway- and one week from that time the brother was on his way to New Orleans. It was the early spring of this year, but one of those rare days, when the sun, tired of his icy bondage, bursts upon the earth with a sudden warmth of glory that startles all nature out of her chill repose into a soft dreamy state, half waking and half sleeping.- Bird, insect, the open blossom, air, cloud, and water, responded lovingly to the call of their mother, thus awakened, and for her sang in chorus songs of sweetest har- mony. Filled with the exquisite loveliness of the day, Catesby lingered upon his accustomed evening ride, falling uncon- sciously into- a sympathy with the hazy dreaminess around him. Lost in the tone delightful sense of living, of breathing the fresh luxurious air, he wandered along the river's bank, utterly unheeding the danger by his side. He rode along the crumbling levee, and although a tremendous flood was rising, hurled down from an icy home far back on the tmoun- tains of the west, so much, was he absorbed as not to notice that the slight embankment along which he rode was trem-   DEATH OP LITTLE RED-HEAD.       89 bling beneath his horse's feet.  Living and being were enough for him; for Mark had been fortunate lately! and rode with the consciousness of a man well to do in the world. Business had been urged upon him in such an astonishing way, that he could not but regard New Orleans as a real El Dorado to spirited young lawyers. Although it had usually taken the old-fashioned men of his profession more than-half a  lifetime to get into a good practice, Mark had found his youthful talent, appreciated in so extraordinary a degree, that he had almost come to regard the talent of these " old fogies",of the bar with sovereign contempt. In fact, business had flowedi upon him in a greater than usual proportion, and although he could not help an occasional feeling of dis- trust and anxiety, in regarding the strange and unsolicited commissions sent to him from unexpected quarters, yet who is really angry with prosperity, in the worldly sense? He H ^ congratulated himself upon his own merit and legal skill, and d was supremely satisfied that a Catesby could not know want. i The fact was, that Mark possessed a great deal of cleverness in his profession, and though his success was rather mysterious  and extraordinary for so young a man, and one living, too, in a strange and almost foreign city, yet it was deserved, for ; the sake of-his sister, if not entirely and in strict justice for his own. It was the year of a tremendous freshet, and the planters, with that sharpened experience which a long series of losses gives, had, for a week past, detected the symptoms of the coming flood, and had been at work with all their force in strengthening, the weaik places 'of the levee, in dread of the formidable " crevasse." The timbers, ropes, &amp;c., extending over the furious current, were therefore frequent along the bank; but Mark was too much absorbed to notice what was indicated by these signs. His thoughts were in other scenes, and that fair sister that he loved filled all his heart.' The young man had never loved with passion. She alone oc-  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC8245-00000021"/> 40'      DEATH  O OP TTLE RED-4EA. cupied- his- thoughts as yet, and: he had hardly realized that there was a stronger tie on earth. His life had yet been un- settled, though not profligate, in this- respect; and as he worshipped that dear sister, so he invested other women with a sacred and delicious veneration, becoming to a nature purely chivalrOous:.  He looked down into the dark and swollen flood, compar- ing its onward course to his own wild life. It was still with him the spring-time. The summer that could calm those mighty waters into a smooth ad placid current had not yet overtaken him.   " He had pow come in sight of the old and well-known con- vent. He looked at the curious and familiar building, ex- amining its walls, its windows, its gates,with a sort of dim, prophetic feeling, that somehow with it his own destiny was, strangely mingled. Suddenly the small gateway- opened, and a single female cam&amp; out from the sacred precincts. H'is heart throbbed, though he could. not have told why- -That- she wag young, he saw, by her free, graceful carriage. That she was beautiful, he felt by an admonition stronger than reason. An irrepressible desire to see her, which he probably mistook for natural gallantry, grew within him. He urged his horse onward, and as she was walking in a, direetion parallel with him, he was soon gratified by the, sight of one of the- most exquisitely lovely faces that. had ever 'shone upon him this-side of dreamland. And like a dream it vanished; for of a sudden the levee, -or raised bank, crumbled beneath his horse's feet, and horse and rider were precipitated into the mad water&amp; The current was fearfully swift, and the young man was hurled with stunning violence ;against some beams that ex- -tended beyondc the levee over the stream and which :had been used in repairing the damages of the freshet.

Without waiting, however, for their arrival, she promptly threw a rope to Mark, who, although considerably stunned, had consciousness enough left to grasp it. His horse, snorting and struggling desperately, was swept past, and went down the torrent. The frail girl leaned her: body against a post which had been sunk: as. a sort of pivot into the, levee for the arms, of the rest of the machinery 'to work upon, and giving the rope a turn about it, was enabled to hold on, even with her small hands, until, the la- bourers came to. her aid. They drew poor Mark up, more dead than alive; for the force of the current had bruised him terribly against the very obstacle that saved him.

All that he knew of his love was, that- she was a Spaniard -or of Spanish- descent: As she was undoubtedly of this race on one side or- other, and most probably of an exiled Mexican family,- he had a faint hope that he might meet her in the direction indicated by this despotic missive, which he  had, by the way, learned to venerate in a singular manner.

He sur- rendered, his practice--he gave up every thing. In a word, he went to Teas!   /   . Our story is here too sadly-we might say, madly true- so far as we Can remember the incidents as detailed to us by one of the mutilated survivors of this extraordinary affair. Our narrator was a member of a distinguished family of the District of Columbia, and had formerly held the rank of lieutenant in the United States navy. - An ungovernable lust for wild-adventure, fired by the- vague and bewildering ro- mance which was just beginning to invest all the details we could then obtain of the life upon. this dangerous frontier, had induced- him to throw up: his commission and repair thither, accompanied by a few young adventurers like him-, self. ' They reached San Antonio de Bahai,kthrough great perils, for at that time nearly the whole route was ifested by bands of various Indian tribes, that have since been reduced to complete-subjection, or entirely exterminated. They found the old Spanish town, of nearly three thousand inhabitants, very coolly domineered over by a little squad of eight or ten Americans, who, as military traders, adven- turers, and desperadoes in general, carried things, with a   DEATH OF LITTLE RED-READ.       43 high hand, pretty much in their own way. They ostensibly recognised the city government, as well as that of Mexico; but as they did not hesitate to shoot or bully any one of the officers of either who might venture to make himself too. officious, these valorous gentlemen were very glad to wink at any misdemeanours they cotild not avoid seeing.' Though hated by all classes of the Mexicans with a deadly hatred, these adventurers knew too well their own value to labour under any very serious apprehensions of any outhreak of this feeling, further than an occasional fray in a gambling- hell or pulque-shop. They had 'to look out, to be sure, in passing dark door- ways or rounding corners, not :t6 hug either too close, for the assassin's blade is the only. one the Mexican wields with effect. But this made little difference with these reckless men, who scorned the apprehension of danger in any form at a Mexican's hand, though they took good care to keep their eyes- open, nevertheless. The true secret of their power lay far enough beyond the civic limits, for the Mexican inhabitants dreaded more than any thing else on this earth-or in purgatory, even-the annual descents of the Camanche tribes from their, impene- trable mountains. These audacious plunderers had never  yet received a single salutary check upon this frontier until the appearance of a few North Americans in Bahai; and though they had received from these some severe lessons, yet they had not yet been entirely sufficientf to inspire them with that remarkably wholesome respect for the rifle which they have since exhibited; yet these had nevertheless made them somewhat shy, as the matter between them had-finally come to be settled-by a sort of tacit arrangement of-"You let me alone-I let you alone."  We cannot say that this agreement had at any time -been too strictly kept -on either side; but as the bickerings and animosities between the adventurers and the Mexicans had  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC8245-00000023"/> ".      -DEATH OF LITTLE RED-HEAD. become, day by day, more and more deadly on one side, and ferociously contemptuous on the ;other, they had at last come to regard the outrages of their natural enemies upon this malignant and treacherous population with a jeering indif- ference, and enjoyment, even, that was terribly galling. As they now pretty much confined themselves to looking out for their own interests and keeping neutral, the Ca- manches soon took the hint, and did, not disturb them or their property, unless on occasion when the temptation thrown in their way proved too strong, and then I suppose they thought the fault lay most at the' door of the Americans -who, knowing their'weakness,. should not have subjected them to so severe a trial: though the result usually was, a sound drubbing thefirst time they could be caught. Yet as no very serious disparity in accounts had arisen in the long run, both parties were willing to be content in not exacting too strict a settlement every time they met. Matters had been standing in this position for some time, and the Mexicans were becoming rapidly impressed with the profoundest conviction that they had been unduly thankless forthe goods the gods- had sent them in the person of the redoubtable borderer, Captain Red, or "Little Red-head," as the Indians had christened him, from the fiery colour of hip hair, and his formidable band of riflemen: they were accordingly of late fawningly endeavouring to propitiate them, and make every amends for the past. But no!  The sturdy anid reckless adventurers treated them with-more galling mockery, which they bore Iwith' only increased servility. - No creature on earth is sh pitifully sub- servient as the Mexican when the " time of his fear cometh." They well knew this trait, and greatly amused themselves in drawing out these servile and. unconscious traits, which, of course,ibecame more and more ludicrous to the Americans at the usual time--the spring--when the time of the Camanches' de- scent approached. They heaped indignity after indignity upon   DEATH OF LITTLE RED-HEAD.       45 them, and though many a f/urious eye glared from beneath the shadow of a slouched sombrero upon them as they passed, the hand that clutched the assassin's knife dared not strike a blow-they feared them-they hated them-but they needed them! The disasters of the last two years had cowed them; but well the Americans knew that, once released from their in- cumbent fear, these treacherous slaves would turn upon them with redoubled vindictiveness, and therefore scorned their fawning, as well as their malignity. Matters were in about the above position when our in- formant, with his three comrades, arrived. They were wel- comed with that reckless and bantering good-fellowship, which is usually so remarkable towards countrymen, among men placed ha bitually in circumstances of great danger. They were forthwith taken in hand, and with a boisterous civility, shown round all the lions of the place-monte tables -pulque-shops-cock-pits-the great cathedral-not forget- ting, you may rest assured, the dark-eyed and voluptuous Senoritas.  These preliminaries over, the parties proceeded to business, though in a manner precisely as informal as every thing else. Somebody proposed, that as they were now strong enough to whip all Mexico, with the Camanche nation thrown in, '4 we do hereby organize for the above purpose!" As this was received with tremendous applause, and as nobody was of course thought of as leader but Captain Red, the next question was, "What shall our name be?" Several rather romantic names having been proposed by the younger members, and which did not prove entirely satisfactory to the rest of the company, at last the captain arose. He was a man below the average height, with a head most resembling that of a Scotch terrier, with its wiry, bristling hair on fire, except that the bushy, freckled face, and round, quick eyes,   &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC8245-00000024"/> "      DEATH OF. LITTLE RED-HEAD. were dignified by a broad, yet low forehead, of almost snowy whiteness, -while the stiff, heavy eyebrows fairly blazed in contrast along its rim. This singularly-looking person merely remarked in a sharp, quick voice- "'Boys! it's no' use with that nonsense! We're going to take care of a pretty big range around here, and why shouldn't we call ourselves Rangers?" "Good!"  "Good!" "That's the figure!" "That's the name for us!" "Hurrah!--Three cheers for Captain Red!" "Now three for the Texas Rangers!" was uproariously shouted from as many different voices, and the matter was settled. This celebrated order, thus originating upon this frontier, lost precious little time in discussing the " articles of war," either on that occasion, or on many a ond since, in which they have made themselves felt withal, and that "with a vengeance!" They now set themselves to work in serious earnest, each man equipping himself at his own expense, to regulate the affairs of the Border. The country, when not scoured by savage tribes, was suffering terribly from' the maraudings of cut-throat bands of robbers from the valley of tthe Rio Grande. These wretches, ferocious as they were cowardly, committed the most horrible outrages upon the feeble and almost de- fenceless rancheros on the northern side of the Rio Grande, and along the river San Antonio, the Coleto, the Gauda- loupe, and upon the white settlements even of the Colorado, and along the Brazos to the neighbourhood of where Houston now-stands, on the north, and down' the whole length of the Nueces on the south. Whenever this daring little band could hear of such depredations in reasonable time for pur- suit of the perpetrators, the cry was instantly "to horse!" and away, on their swift and hardy steeds, in thestrue spirit of the ancient chivalry, they rushed "to the rescue!" It ,-    'DEATH OP LITTLE RED-HEAD.      47 mattered not to them who were the parties-ranchero or white man, so they did not belong to San Antonio-they perilled life and limb to avenge their wrongs, and many a wild deed of fierce and summary retribution did they wreak upon those dastardly plunderers, under the valiant lead of the stern and chivalric "Red," whose name grew still more a word of terror to robber or Camanche. "' Los INDIOS! Los Indios! Garracho! Los Indios!" The dreaded cry of alarm, mingled with screams and wails and yells of terror, suddenly arose in the quiet, sunny square of San Antonio de Bahai, one fine morning in the early spring. In a moment, above all these sounds, rang out in hoarse, unearthly screeches, the wooh! woo! woo! woo! wooh! of the Camanche war-whoop-while, driven pell-mell before the long, lithe lances of the marauders-men, women, and children, mingledVwith- cattle, horses, mules, pigs, and poultry, were tumbled headlong over each other through the narrow streets into the wide square. A party of Americans, on a carouse in a long, low stone house that fronted the square on the northern side, arose quite deliberately from the table, and, with glasses in hand, stepped, with no very steady gait, to the doors and windows, to see the "sport," as they facetiously called it-for they understood the meaning of such sounds well enough. Sport for devils it was, with a vengeance! The frightened' Mexicans, bewildered- by the suddenness of the thing-for this descent was unexpectedly early-and by their terrors together, were running confusedly here and there about the square-while the dark, fantastically bedizened warriors were plunging to and fro- upon their swift and active horses, ,trampling the, panic-stricken mass, driving their bloody lances through the nearest victims, of whatever sex, age, or  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC8245-00000025"/> k4Sr18    SMDEATH OF LITLE RED-HEAD. condition, and howling like starved wild beasts with their white-fanged jaws amidstfa helpless prey. The sene was sufficiently horrifying to have appalled the most ferocious -spirit of ruffianism; but our jollificating Ameridans,               . "' Albeit not used to the melting mood," seemed rather to enjoy it mostldecidedly. \ Some poor wretches rushed towards the door where these drunken-madmen stood; one or two pushel them back with their feet,-"No, no! you infernal Greasers! you can't get inhere! you've got to take :it as it comes!"  But, to the eredit-of humatna nature, Captain Red rushed forward, pushed thiese broutes aside, and said-"No! hold.! shame, boys! let thiem in." He was obeyed, but with evident reluctance by some. ;This humane-act first attracted the -attention of the Caman- ches to them, -for -they had been -too :busy to observe their presence %bfore. Thlke warriors in pursuit of the fugitives galloped :almost up to the door, when, recognising at a glance the ,dreaded form of Little Red-head,.they set up a yell of surprise, and drew back.  In a moment the news spread, and the shouts of the chiefs soon drew togeiher-the scattered warriors. Collected on the opposite side of the .square, the Rangers saw, to their no litle surprise, what they had not suspected during the confu- sion, that this was one of the most formidable body of Indians any one of then -had ever seen :together. What the precise number might be, -no one could do more than -make conjec- tures, and such passed hurriedly through the room, rating them at from- three to five, six, and eight hundred. ITo say that these men were any more than surprised, would be absurd, Jas the sequel will show. They were in a moment or ;two -more boisterous in their hilarity than before, and crowded about-the door, drinking, and laughing at the forlorn ,appearance of the killed and wounded Mexicans strewed ,    DEATH OF LITTLE RED-HEAD.      -49- about the square, and occasionally shouting- some half- drunken jibe across the square at the Camanches.  - In the mean-time, the clatter of hoofs-the neighing and bellowing of their frightened owners--had died away through the different streets into which they had made their escape; the crowded fugitives, with their cries of pain, had disap- peared together into the houses around and nearest to the square, and only the laughter and shouts of the Americans 'rose occasionally above the momentary lull, of which the groans from the wounded made a sort of silence. The Camanches gathered together in a close squad, and seemed to be holding a council of war for a few moments, by gestures, and in such low terms that nothing could be heard from them; when suddenly, Ilke a itock-of swallows diving from an old tree-top, they broke up, scattering in all directions, to come together again in the middle of the square as suddenly-hooting, yelling, and shaking their lances in -the. faces, almost, of the Rangers, as they darted past the door of their quarters. As this was merely bravado, they took no further notice of it than to jeer at them in the most insulting manner: not condescending, even, to step back into the room to fetch their rifles. But when-this insolent challenge to a fight had been re- peatoed several times, and at each with some more insulting demonstration, the majority of the party began to become incensed.  They grasped their rifles, and were rushing to the door and windows to resent these indignities, when Cap- tain Red again restrained them. This impunity only increased the insolence of the savages, whose object was clearly to provoke a sally on the part of the fiery Americans; but, if some of the men were not, their captain was, cool enough to upderstand this very well, and to prevent it, especially as he could clearly perceive their exultation at the thought of hav- ing him at such overwhelming advantage.  , '  "  A    &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC8245-00000026"/> 50      DEATH OF LITTLE RED-HEAD. Such an infernal babel of whooping, screeches, howls, and yells, as now filled that square, was probably never heard before from the same number of human throats. - They dared not--or rather it is against one of the fixed usages of their warfare-to charge upon a building or enclosure of any kind, and therefore, when they found they were not coming forth, they changed -their tactics essentially, for this seemed too good a chance to entrap their hated foe. The main body drew back to the other side of the square, and dismounting, laid their bows and lances down at their feet, and then stood with folded arms at the heads of their horses, to signify that they would be contemptuous lookers on, while a party of only twenty picked warriors rode for- ward at a gallop, and when immediately in front of the door, a fellow among them, who spoke a little Spanish, dared them to come forth and meet them in equal combat, calling them cowards, women, dogs, and every possible obscene, epithet, and pointing back to the large body of warriors behind, told them that brave men scorned to fight such white-faced cowards at disadvantage of numbers, and that these would not move from where they were if that great coward chief, Little Red- head, dared to come out and prove that he was not a feeble woman, &amp;c. &amp;c. The Rangers, who had now recovered their good-humour, only greeted this ludicrous farce with loud shouts of laughter, and twirled their fingers at' them ludicrously, The savages, rendered furious at this failure of their-as they supposed-.profound stratagem, wheeled their horses suddenly, and slapped their breech-clouts at them as they galloped off. - At this, thedlast indignity an Indian can offer to a foe, and which no frontiersman can. or will endure, by one simultaneous movement the Rangers sprang to their rifles, and let drive a terrible volley among them, which -tumbled nearly a dozen of the rash vaunters from their saddles.   DEATH OF LITTLE RED-HEAD.      51 This unexpected retaliation very suddenly awaked the Camanches up from the delusion of impunity, and brought back rather emphatically to their memories the kind of per- sons they were dealing with-.for this kind of conclusion had been no part of their calculations. Their object Jhad been to taunt the Rangers forth to meet them on their own, that is, open ground, where they would have all the advan- tage of numbers and of their peculiar modes of warfare. They had thought that a brave so noted for fierce courage as was the Little Red-head, would not stop to consider num- bers, when grossly insulted after the manner in which we have seen, and, when invited to come out for an equal fight, but would rush forth with all his men to meet the challenge; when, they would have him in their pdwer, as it -would only take an instant to regain their arms, leap -into their saddles, and be upon him before he could possibly regain shelter. Now, when they saw some of their most noted braves tum- bling from. their horses as the fruits of their foolish mistake, their rage knew no bounds but that of usage, which pre- vented them from storming- a fortress of any kind, and they rushed forward with the horrid' cries of infuriated demons; and, in face of another galling fire from the house, they bore off the bodies of the slain, by this time considerably increased in number, and shaking their lances behind them with dia- bolical gestures of menace, they passed clattering through the town towards the open plains on the west, while the taunting laugh of the Rangers was shouted in their ears. They continued for an hour or so to gallop to and fro in swift troops, like flocks of plovers, over the plain, making insult- ing gestures and uttering cries of defiance in renewed invita- tion to the Rhngers to come forth. \ Some of the parties, again emboldened- by their quiet, re-entered the town, and com- mitted some most infernal outrages upon the poor Mexicans, which were every now and then reported to the Rangers by some breathless messenger-eaen carrying off a number of  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC8245-00000027"/> 52,      DEATH OP LITTLE RED-HEAD. handsome Mexican girls. These cool gentry heard all this with the greatest unconcern, and- continued their carouse amid shouts of laughter at the expense of the poor Camanches. Suddenly the Little Red-head, whose blood was now up, as he had tasted battle, sprang to his feet as the shrieks of some poor Mexican women, who were being dragged into hateful and hideous captivity, were wafted to his ears- "Boys, I can't stand this! Let's drive these scoundrels back to their own mountains." The: words were scarcely spoken, when every man jumped to his feet as by one electric impulse, and sprang for his rifle amid cries of approval.  We can whip the whole!"  That's you, captain! We're your boys.! We'll fan 'em  out, the filthy thieves, if, they are a thousand." "Hurrah for our captain! He's some in a brier-patch!" "We'll teach these dirty copper-heads to come into Bahai while Rangers own it! Whoop! whoop! hurrah, boys! One more glass, before ie part to get our horses!" said Captain Red, as he filled his to the brim. The rest followed suit, and in another moment, amid the sounds of social uproar, these men separated to get their horses for a ride on one of the maddest dare-devil chases ever ridden by men before. 'It took them but a little while to mount,; for a Ranger's horse is always ready at a moment's warning, as well as his arms; and with one wild whoop, which made the terrified Mexicans tremble and slink closer in their corners, they dashed out of town at full speed, in the pursuit. When they emerged from the streets of the town and its thin, straggling suburb of -dobey huts, they came abruptly upon the broad plain of the prairie, which, after a short dis- tance, became gradually dotted, at wide intervals, with small islands of timber, called "motts." They saw, to their;no small surprise, only a single predatory party, such as we have spoken of: and this seemed to have just issued from the I -     *  '      '"s, .^      .   DEATH OF LITTLE RED-HEAD.      58 town, and to be encumbered with plunder and prisoners. The hurried supposition was, that the other parties who had so lately been in sight, must have crossed the San Antonio River above, andrbe entering the town on the her side. Be that as it may, had it been one party or the whole body of the enemy, it would have been all the same to the Rangers; so they dashed at the one in view, and, come what might, they meant to overhaul it at any rate. The race soon became exciting, since, as the flying party were encumbered heavily, the Americ&amp;ns gained ra- pidly upon them, and were beginning to yell, in anticipated triumph, when they reached the larger motts, which are several miles out from the town. Here the fugitives were suddenly joined by another party, which glided out from be- hind one of them, and seemed to take a portion of the em- barrassing burdens upon themselves-by which movement the pace of the first was wonderfully accelerated. The sight-of this accession only increased the enthusiasm of the Americans, who urged the race with yet greater eagerness; for the Indians were just about three to one now, and that-would afford them some sport. The distance be- tween the two parties was at once considerably increased,-- for these Indians have a wonderful faculty of getting work out of their tough mountain horses-so much so, indeed, that they usually escape from American horsemen, even when the latter are better mounted. When the chase had continued for several miles, the Ca- manches either really were, or appeared to be, losing ground. Their /horses flagged in speed considerably, and when this was noticed, Little Red-head bent forward in his saddle, and, yelling like a madman, lashed his horse until the blood flew at each whacking blow, and shouting hoarsely, "They're ours! Come on!" darted ahead. His party, as much ex- cited as himself, responded until the welkin fairly rang again with their fierce cries.  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC8245-00000028"/> 54      DEATH OF LITTLE RED-HEAD. On! on! sweeps the clattering race, hurled headlong over the shaking plain-now beginning to change its cha- racter-which, heretoforei had been only diversified. by "motts" of timber, scattered promiscuously over the surface; but now they were approaching a long line of thick timber, fenced along its edges by &amp; low chaparral, of dense and thorny growth, which was utterly impenetrable to horses, and which the naked Camanches would rather die than attempt to ride through, if it-had been possible for horses. This theYiangers well knew, and they had almost held their breaths as they watched--bending over their horses' heads, with parted lips and straining eyes, to see whether the Indians would head in that direction, where they were as securely cornered as if they had run against a stone wall. The moment it became certain that this was the direction they were taking, there was a universal burst of jeering laughter, rendered savagely hysterical by the excited passions of these wild men. "Ha! ha! We've got you now!" was almost hissed, in a smothered vosces from between the set teeth of Little Red- head, as they closed rapidly upon the flying savages, who, exhibiting every signof terror, began to-look back, and drop articles of:plunder. "Ha! peeling-disgorging-are you?   I'll ease your. stomachs- for you!" "muttered the leader, as he looked to his rifle, which. lay across the sadale -before him. "Let out another link, boys!"

Time enough when Awe're among them! They can't escape!" was the prompt command. At this moment -tihe Indians reached the timber, and, one after another, their dark forms disappeared within its seem- #  ,0             1,   DEATH OF LITTLE RED-HEAD.       55 ingly impenetrable bosom-like a great black serpent, gliding into its shadowy den.' To describe-the yell of infuriated as- tonishment-the blank, pale look of surprise, which the Range'rs exchanged during one brief instant of uncertainty, would be impossible. But the stern leader shouted quickly- "On, boys!-if they're going below, we'll follow them!" The men cheered, and they swept after them into the wood. One short minute beneath the shadows-a little time of darkened, breathless speed, and they burst into the sun- lIght of a prairie beyond. Their eyes were dazzled! -Their senses stunned! It was but for an instant. The harsh and stunning howl that greeted them into this dazzling light, they had heard before--these dusky, hideous forms, rush upon them from every side-but they had seen their long lances and feathered crowns shake and toss in fight before- and though they came like a torrent closing round them, these brave men were not unnerved! The ring of their rifles rose in deadly lullaby over- the triumphing howlf of successful strategy--recoiling the over; whelming waves in silence for a moment while the smoke arose-but then the recoil was stayed by the tremendous rush from ty circles without-for they were in the very middle of a cdmp-or rather ambush-of over three hundred Camanches, and only 'those nearest could reach them,.ofe course; but then this rush drove on those before, upon them, trampling the bodies of their own slaia that had fallen by the first fire, and in spite of the terrible execution dbne by the pistols of the Rangers, the roaring tide hurled these inward circles on. The Camanches were wild with ferocious exultation-for here they had, at last, entrapped their for- midable and most audacious foe, the Little Red-head, whose fiery scalp was worth the feathered coronet of a chief to any one of them. Terribly these barbaric billows swayed and rolled before the murderous fire of fifteen hemmed and des- perate men. it ,           &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC8245-00000029"/> 56      DEATH OF LITTLE RED-HEAD. l Pistols soon became useless. Recoil after recoil of the Indians had been driven in, yet the relentless thirst for vengeance and that fiery scalp grew more and more unap- peasable; and though lance grated against lance in the bodies of Ranger after Ranger, and arrows flew like hail, still this strange and furious fight went on. The Rangers had drawn their heavy bowie-knives, and were laying about them with desperate strength, clipping off 'the lance-heads like carrot-tops, as they were frequently crossed above them in the tumultuous struggle.             r It was a volcanic chaos of fringed buckskins-breech- clouts-streaming feathers-rifles--lances--pistols-arrows -horses-oaths-knives-death-groans--screamsyells and whoops, boiling and tumbling wild' beneath the smiling sun of God's own blessed, gentle spring. Ah, it was horrible enough! It would seem as if this presumptuous squad should have been borne down- at once, and utterly exterminated by this tremendous pressure; but it should be kept in view; that the Camanches had at that time little knowledge of firearms beyond the effects from which they had suffered, or been e itnesses of, and therefore greatly amplified them, and indeed held themr in a sort of superstitious awe.  Be this as it may, perhaps the world never witnessed--on a feiall scale, to be sure--a more remarkable instance of an agile, fierce, relentless struggle, than this between these few men and the comparative host by-whom they were surrounded. Think of it!-fifteen to over three hundred!--taken by sur- prise, too! There was one young man in this doomed party, who had acted wildly since, they set off on this fatal chase. He it was who had whispered hurriedly in the ear of Little Red- head something that, in addition to the shrieks of women they were carrying off, caused his sudden'and unexpected proposition to follow the Camanches. He had been one of   DEATH OF LITTLE RED-HEAD.      57 those who came out in the party Ivith the lieutenant whom I have mentioned as my informant. His real name had not been given. He had begen the most eager and rash of the Rangers, and had fought with almost superhuman fierceness. Since the moment of their falling into this ambush, his ob- ject had seemed to be to cut his way through the over- whelming mass in the direction of a group of warriors at a little distance, that took no part in what was going on, but were evidently in charge of the prisoners. He bad even taken the lead of his captain, and by his frantic efforts had succeeded in carving a bloody lane through the Indians to this point. They had evidently been impressed with a sort of panic by his incredible fury, and gave way before a despe- ration which seemed to bear a charmed life. Now was the time to escape, if ever! But his eager eye had sought for one form among the prisoners. There were but three. The glance was quick as lightning, but seemed to be sufficient. "Oh, God! she is not there!" He rather shrieked these words than spoke them, turned ashy pale, and without a word more, or a single groan, pitched forward over the head of his horse, among the trampling hoofs.' Little Red-head was at his side when he thus fell, without a wound; for, strangely enough, he had as yet entirely escaped. With a strange, sorrowful cry, he reigned in his horse, and. the. last, that was seen of Little Red-head, twenty lances were meeting-through his unresist- ing body; and as the two young men who escaped burst free upon the open ground again, and made off, bleeding with many wounds, the demoniac yells of-triumph from the Ca- manches echoed horribly in their ears., There was little attempt made to overtake them, and they got in safe-the lieutenant with the loss of the finger and thumb of one hand, together with half a dozen body-wounds, and his friend reel- ing in the saddle from the loss of blood from as many more.  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC8245-00000030"/> DEATH OF LITTLE RED-HEAD. Thus ended this horrible and strange affair, which, perhaps, has hardly a parallel in any annals. But not the least sin- gular part of it was revealed afterwards. From papers discovered among the effects of Little Red- head, it appeared that this young man was Mark Catesby, and that Red was his natural brother-an illegitimate son of old Catesby!! A paper of instructions with regard to Mark was found, too, containing the mysterious signature "Regulus," and which was worded in the imperious language of entire despot- ism. What became of the young girl Juliet Garcia, we may yet hear. That she was snatched up on the street, and carried off by the Camanches, is all we can say at present. /A ,                        .  *    !        -  GABRIELLE: THE WHTE MARE OF CHHUAHUA. CHAPTER I. THE remarkable valley of Encinnillas, which extends for a long distance north of the city of Chihuahua, on the route to Paso del Norte, is noted for its three great haciendas, and 'for the contrasts in colours maintained in its immense herds of more than half-wild cattle. The greatest of them, the Hacienda Encinnillas, at the head of the valley, contained many thousand head of a dark-brown, shaggy-breed, re- sembling the buffalo somewhat in appearance, and still more in fierceness. The next, Hacienda Sauz, contained a less but still very great number of a heavier-built variety, the coats of which were, with the occasional exception of a few small mottles, as white as the bull Europa rode; while the third, Hacienda Torrean, was covered-withi herds of a tall, slim, active animal, possessed of enormgus horns, and a colour varying little from uniform jet-black, with sometimes a few white marks. To a stranger moving down this pic- turesque -Valley, these marked and consistent contrasts would seem very curious; but by a provincial, they would only be regarded with connoisseuring interest. The prevalence of this sort of fancies among the privileged and hereditary owners of these great estates, and the singu- 59  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC8245-00000031"/> 60C          GABRIELLE lar extent to which emulation would carry them in preserving the integrity of their favourite colours throughout the whole of their uncounted herds, were matters not only of severe criticism, but of sympathetic interest, among all grades of their countrymen. Some years since, an old and proud Spaniard of the hi- dalgo blood, called Don Carlos Gonzaleze, was governor of the province of Chihuahua, in Northern Mexico. This venerable soldier owned the great Hacienda Encin- nillas, situated as above described, between ninety and a hundred miles north of the city of Chihuaahua, on a small tributary of the Rio Conchas. His mansion, which was about in the middle of the estate, was a very extraordinary looking building in some respects, though in others it was only peculiar to the country, or rather to Mexico, both north and south. As you approach along the winding bank of the small, clear stream which descends to meet you, swift, bright, and cold, from out the dark fastnesses of the 'huge'  sierra, looming vaguely in the immeasurable distance toward the west, you obtain the first glimpse of it, and that while entering from a wide, undulating prairie, sodded with crisp- curling grama grass, and covered with -herds of cattle and mottled horses, beneath the low shadows of a great forest of 'live-oak: trees. These oaks, although scattered over the surface something in the proportion of a dozen to an acre, shroud the pale sward beneath by the prodigious stretchings of their low, long arms, hung from the nearest to the outermost twigs with the drooping and pensile drapery of a gray and shining moss, in a sort of swinging, slow and nearly funereal gloom; but the moss seems almost too much alive, as it waves with a mild shine in the breeze, and, with the hardy glisten of the evergreen live-oak leaves, makes a sort of reflex twilight on the dainty sward. The walls of the hacienda glitter strangely beneath-the. ,sun in the distance, and visions of the miraculous creations   THE WHTE MARE OF CHHUAHZUA.      61 of Aladdin's lamp are suggested; but as you approach, the illusion is dispelled, for you perceive them to be built of a light-gray pudding-stone, of volcanic origin, peculiar to this ; province, and which holds in it a large proportion of shining quartz. It is a beautiful and singular stone for building, -and is susceptible of the highest polish, which in this in- stance it had received. The singular appearance of this building is not a little heightened by the great size and number of its windows, of diminutive laminae of mica, which on three sides, as you ap- proach, reach from near the eaves of the single story to within two feet of the ground, and are separated by intervals of less than three feet. This gives to this portion of the mansion a shiny, glistering appearance, which is grimly enough contrasted with the long continuation of solid ma- sonry beyond, which grins with small port-holes only, and looks massive enough to defy a strong cannonade, You are thus forcibly reminded that though this be a sunny land of the orange and the vine, it is also one of blood. Indeed, the fortress-like appearance of the rear of the house is- amply enough compensated by the gay and light- some air of the front; for all the great windows of- this quaint conservatory are clustered about with -sweet-scented f  shrubs bearing delicate blooms, and filled with the mag- nificent flowers of the tropics, or festooned across the in- tervals with the polished leaves and gorgeous trumpets of evergreen creepers, and wild vines of the native grape, with their dark-purple clusters. As might be expected in such a scene, the sweet voice of a woman is heard. It is a low, mellow warble, swelling fitfully upon the perfume-burdened air, with drowsy pauses, as if some sleeping song-bird twittered in a dream. Through one of those low great windows, and between the clustering flowers and vines, a young Spanish cavalier was peering cau- tiously, as if to obtain a sight of the warbler, himself unseen.  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC8245-00000032"/> 62          GABRIELLE:  He was very young, and a very handsome fellow, too. His long, black, wavy hair fell down his shoulders, over the rich colours of his splendid serape. His trousers of buckskin, beautifully dressed to resemble black velvet, with two rows of silver buttons and links down the side, showed, through the wide slash, the delicate pink silk of the drawers beneath, while a long, black plume fell back over the wide brim of his gay and bead-wrought sombrero. His' slight, downy moustache shaded a delicate but sensuous lip; his nose had the proud vault of the Roman, and his large black eyes literally glittered with eager delight, as he gazed into that great airy room. And of a truth, the object he saw there was such as to justify him fully in his curious eagerness, for in clear view, the delicate, voluptuous, and superlatively lovely form of the beauty of the whole province, the daughter of the old governor, reclined upon a sofa in; all the graceful abandon of unconsciousness, singing herself drowsily into the siesta in which all fanish maidens are proverbial for indulging.     4 It was a glorious picture the young man stood bending forward in breathless rapture to enjoy. She was " beautiful exceedingly," that dark-eyed senorita, with her long, black lashes, that felllike feathery clouds over the pale-tinted olive of her glowing cheeks. The very lids seemed burdened with their dark, shining weight, as they struggled heavily to rise, in sleepy cadence with the sultry monody she sang. But those dim peepers flew open, widely enough, like a burst of starlight through the darkness, when, with a sudden move- ment, the young man sprang through the window, which he had thrown up, into her room;- and, with a low cry, half of fright and -half of joyful surprise, she leaped into his arms, and there suddenly rang upon the air that crisp, mysterious sound with which young lovers are familiar. Without regard- ing the poor guitar which had been leaning against her lap, and now fell with a crash upon the floor, the young lovers \                        .   THE WHTE MARE OF CHHUAHUA.      63 clung to each other as if this were to be the last moment of their earthly meeting. Indeed, it was a shocking pity to serve the frail guitar so, for, like every other article in the great room, it was singu- larly slight and delicate, and seemed as if it might have made the music for Titania's court; while the harp which stood near looked an aeolian thing, just fitted for the fingers of young Zephyrus. It was a fair and pleasant vision, that of the meeting of these young and tender lovers, both so beautiful and fresh, both so fond and so trusting, the halcyon life just dawning upon them. Surely, it would never know the shadow of change,! From the intimate endearments and familiarity of bearing and language toward each other, it was apparent 'that this was no sudden love-affair, but that they had known each other long, even for life. In fact, the pair were neigh- bours, and had seldom, since early childhood, been separated long at a time. They had been unconsciously betrothed since childhood by their parents, who had witnessed, with many a secret chuckle of no small, delight, the progress of their fa- vourite-scheme. They had been too judicious to disclose the intended purpose to either party until within a very short time, when the intended pair had come to them with fear and trembling, to obtain that sanction to their love and proposed marriage which the old governor and his chief friend and supporter, his near neighbour, the old General Jose Espar- tero, were so well,prepared to grant in advance. There had been a small pretence of stern questioning, par- ticularly on the part of the veteran general, the most anxious of the two, and then, of- course, a delighted assent had been given; for, as the estates of the old governor were far more extensive and valuable than hi"own, he was something the -gainer by the bargain, though the convenient contiguity of the Hacienda Sauz reconciled that person fully to the dis-  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC8245-00000033"/> "         GABRIELLE: parity, especially since the general was his most powerful political supporter. The young people had been thrown much, indeed, and -almost incessantly together. They had shared the same amusements and studies, had travelled together to the city -of Chihuahua in the same coach of state, had danced together at the fandangos of the governor's court, had gossipped together, and- though we do not pretend to say exactly that they took their siestas together, yet we do assert that they took them at the same time, and in much the same fashion; and, however shocking it may appear to American readers, we further assert that they took their afternoon baths toge- ther; without fail, when the last cigaretta of the siesta had burned up to their lips. Thus it will be perceived they had at least been moderately intimate for a long time; and, as they were altogether the handsomest and richest couple in the whole province, what could be more natural than that they should have gradually become inseparable; and, although they might have had- with the fortune of all other lovers, for whom " the course of true love never did run smooth"-an occasional bickering or small lovers' quarrel, yet, on the whole, 'imagined that it was mutually impossible to live without each other. They had latterly, indeed, become so thoroughly convinced of this self- evident truth, that the fear of death had become alarmingly present with them, and the determination to dodge for the. present this " inevitable end" so remarkably warm, that they were beseeching the old dons to set fire with the torch of hymen to the whole quiverful of the arrows of-that venerable archer, death.  The old dons were nothing loath in special, but for the present, as they saw, there was no need for hurry, were amusing themselves by torturing the ardour of 4 their mutual heirs, in putting off the hour of bliss by pre- tended serious excuses about age, settlements, &amp;c. &amp;c. This, by 'the way, a dangerous sport in any climate, is   THE WHTE MARE OF CHHUAHUA.      65 especially so in a country so near the sun as Mexico; and if much further protracted, what the result of these long, cling- ing caresses we have witnessed already might have been, "we can better conjecture than describe!"And, indeed, they are not usually very particular in inquiring about these things, either of the future or of the past, in any part of Mexico; and we do not see why we should trouble ourselves to do so here, especially as our future must show for itself. We would convey no shadow of imputation against the pru- dence of the fair Senorita Gabrielle, any more than against the unsullied purity of that modest Adonis of handsome young cavaliers, Don Juan Espartero; but we do mean to convey to fond and mischievous old "egovernors" in general, a protest and injunction against'the perils of such dangerous sport, especially, as we remarked, in warm climates, where the young ppple" are surrounded by blazing flowers, that pant "with their love-laden" fiery breaths upon the sultry air, as we have seen this handsome couple. However, as providentially nothing more came of it in this in- stance than quite a serious expenditure of warm and still more fragrant breaths than those of the amorous flowers, breathed in certain mysterious explosives, at which we have hinted, and quite as large a proportion in quick yearning sighs, we may safely venture to relate what did follow, namely, ciga- rettes! the bath! &amp;c. &amp;c.; but one thing at a time, The first greetings over, (we don't say how long this took,) off came the gay sombrero of the young don, and from it came forth the most delicately-fibred leaves of the husk envelope of the ear of the Indian corn; then his keen, jewel-hilted stil- letto flashed in his jewelled-hand, as with a quick and graceful movement he cuts the leaf transversely; and then opening his gold tobacco-box, filled with the dark, fat tobacco of the northern barbarians, which had been chopped up quite fine, he proceeds to strew a smart pinch of this along the shuck- leaf he has cut; and then, by an inconceivably rapid manipu- E  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC8245-00000034"/> ":    sOABRIELLE: lation, rolled it up, and presented the little tube to the se- norita with a low bow. It was, accepted playfully, and she gabbled in the prettiest conceivable coquettish way to him while watching the process of manufacturing a similar, though stronger obne, for himself. This completed, out comes the elegant silver box, in which is carried the ever- lasting flint, steel, and tinder of the Mexican and Spaniard. Another flash and sparkle: the burning "punk" is handed to her: the cigaretta lighted, and -those rich, dainty lips, become at once the breathing crater of a blue, curling aroma. The "punk" returned to him, his own is rapidly ignited, and they are quickly enveloped in the slowly-lifted cloud of sleepy fumes. Now the loving clatter of their gentle voices gradually subsides into fragmentary inquiries, with answers in slow pantomime from opposite sofas, while their endearing glances sleepily grow dim beneath the brooding soporific. A few minutes and they breathe in harmonious concert, gentle as two young eastern nightingales within a bush of poppy; the cigarette, in the mean time, slowly -subsiding to- ward their compressed lips, until at last, in half an hour, it had burned down into an uncomfortable neighbourhood to those red-ripe "nectaries of bliss"-where, as might reason- ably be expected, symptoms of wakeful return to their sub- lunary relations might readily be detected, and soon, with a small start, caused by the l^re that had burned down, they again woke to paradise in each other's eyes. The gentle Gabrielle sprang quickly to the neglected guitar, which had lain upon the floor like some fairy toy neglected-and with swift, practised fingers, beat upon its taut and unmarred strings a tinkling reveillie in some wild gipsy air of Andalusia, that made her young lover bound with a joyous laugh to his feet, improvising the movement, accompanying the air in a dance, as wild and graceful as its rollicking cadences. -,.    THE WHTE MARE OF CHtHUAtHUA.     67 Soon the guitar is thrown down, and with arm linked in arm, they go dancing through the long sunny room, toward that gloomy continuation of the mansion, concerning which we have spoken. They passed through a wide, strong door, like the gate of a fortress, -from this frail summer-house of glass, into the dark shadows of the fortified court beyond. Here they entered upon a square of some three or four hun- dred feet on each side, upon which the low but massive . houses of the Peones of the hacienda faced, by narrow en- trances at short distances, and thesk entrances descending, by an easy and pebbly path from each, to the narrow bed of the small, clear mountain stream which we have mentioned, and which passed through the centre over its natural bed, and then, by a short wind, came out so as to pass exactly at the proper picturesque distance, before the front of the mas- sive palace and ice-like parlours of the mansion. They descended through the wider door of the interior, and on both sides there was a small alcove, hung with drapery to the ground. Into the two the lovers separately retired. Theresa quick transfer of the garments habitually worn was effected, and they came forth in the thinnest and slightest possible costume, it must be confessed; but still it was a costume, comparatively. Hand in hand they descended into the clear, swift stream, with such a shudder as any one who has been once introduced to an ice-bath may well conceive; but the shudder was soon forgotten in the fun! -Such a splashing as there was! The bed of the small stream spread and deepened here into a beautiful basin, extending nearly the whole length of the court. This was the hour for general bathing, and the pool was swarming with young girls, the daughters of the Peone inmates of the court. These were entirely nude; for nothing is' more common -in any part of Mexico than to see females of this class in such condition, bathing publicly in the rivers, when they will return the wondering and curious stare of the 12      - \ t  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC8245-00000035"/> 68          GABRIELLE: North American passer-by with interest, and then coolly proceed with their sports. It is a very cheerful and en- livening scene, and of course peculiarly attractive to the habitual connoisseur ,of feminine graces. We shall not un- dertake categorically, and with a grave technical minute- ness, to name, classify, and describe the genuine and specific character of the charms thus frankly exposed. We can only specify that their figures, from the youngest girls up to the  developed women, were remarkable for symmetry and a vo- luptuousness of outline peculiar to those southern races which possess any mixture of Spanish blood. Their dark limbs glowed beneath the pellucid water with a round, - bewitching grace tha/t defies description; while they stood still, in abashed- and half-awed silence, at the moment when their young mistress and expected master were descending to the water. For this little, space of time they seemed, beneath the veils of their long dark hair, which many of them had thrown back with both hands upraised, most like a group of startled Naiads, who stand listening, while "Triton winds his hollow shell" to announce the sudden coming of old Neptune! But very soon, with gradual accession, the hubbub rises to be quite as great again, a d all the court is ringing with the merriment of sweet but reckless clamours. They kept at first at a rather respectful distance from the young senorita and don; but as these cheerful persons seemed-to be utterly fearless of any undue encroachments upon their rank, or rather unconscious of any such thing as etiquette to defend, it'was not long before they were in the midst of the scream- ing throng, being splashed, and splashing water upon them in turn, and participating as noisily as the rest in the exhila- rating sports of the bath. But all pleasant scenes must have an end, and so had the bath; and the two, with their thin robes clinging to dripping forms, retired to the curtained alcoves to dress-a process '. -    /         I. j    THE WHTE MARE OF CHHUAHUA.       69 which occupied surprisingly little time on either side; when they. came bounding forth at once, and hand in hand, with merry voices "and buoyant steps, they returned through the dark passage-way to the'airy summer-room beyond. With a cry of endearment, the joyous Gabrielle sprang upon the neck of a swarthy and strikingly venerable-looking man, who met themj at the large door or gateway of this room. He greeted the fond child with a parental salute, while he extended his hand with a familiar cordiality to the young don. This was a beautiful picture; the fine- head of the old governor, itshong, white hair mingled sparsely with threads of the intensest black, towered like some iron-gray rock beside a magnolia-tree, to which the flowering vine that clasped its rough pinnacles stretched out its gentler arms. The appearance of Don Carlos Gonzaleze was very noble and careworn.- It was such as you meet a thousand times in Italy, Spain, and everywhere in Mexico where the Spanish blood prevails.  Even among the lazaroni and leperoes of these ancient races, you are constantly struck by meeting with those majestic heads which could only have been born amid the associations of that pride which lives 'in the story of ancient greatness, of those images and objects which are the relics of a glorious art, and those sounds which are the prolonged echoes of a classic lyre. It is a well-known joke that many of the possessors of these noble heads make a good trade of -sitting to the young pilgrims of modern art who visit Rome, and ithat their remarkable lineaments are thus diffused over the jfour quarters of the civilized world as veritable portraits of saint, apostle, hero, priest, and king whose name is associated with the illustrious memories of the Eternal City. For our own part, ihough this fact- may seem matter of gibe and jest to others; it has always conveyed an impression ff deep sadn'ess to ui;j for in no other- is the incurably 'downward tendency" of these once so magnanimous and'  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC8245-00000036"/> 70          GABRIELLE: glorious races to be seen so forcibly. I have often met such persons among Mexican population in the most unexpectedly ignoble positions, frequently with not enough of rags to hide the fine lines of forms possessed of those perfect symmetries which are never one of theaccidents of birth," but which must come from a long line of gentle descent and ennobling deeds. We could never see them without the same feeling with which the passionate lover of ancient art regards the exhumed fragment of some buried era of peculiar grandeur. Wre could never treat such persons, however much degraded as they frequently are, though always with a proud and con- scious bearing even in, degradation, otherwise than with con- sideration. They seem to me the sculptured imbodiments of faded glories, done in flesh by Time,; and left on fiis way- sides to perish miserably because of a perfection too high to be heeded in degenerate conditions and by an emasculated race. The old Don Carlos possessed such a face; but, as is the case with many'others of this stamp, those noble features. expressed rather the "hollow promine" of characteristics formed from any age of loftiness' and noble virtues, than conveyed any substantial reality. He seemed to have been born more-inthe servilities of such an era and of such virtues than with the robust possession of them at any periodwin their vigorous liealth. He was proud, as might. be expected; ambitious, as a matter --of course; brave, as something not quite so consequential. He was pompous, too, and sadly. lacked executive energy, in his old age at least, though he was said to have been possessed of most commanding power at one time, in Spain. He was vain, pompous, and avaricious; audaciously unscrupulous, as such persons usually are; and his very best trait, in a word, was the most extravagant and yearning affection for his daughter. She was the apple of his eye, for whom he would have sold, without hesitation, life, honour, and fortune.   THE WHTE MARE OF CHHUAHUA.      71 The old Don, incorrigibly pompous as he usually -was, always melted into an earnest. and benign manner in the presence of his daughter, and her approved lover: then there was something remarkably attractive about him, his bearing possessed a gracious, pleasing loftiness, which was finely min- gled of the patriarch and ancient Castilian knight. At such times- you could quite forget that the heroic blood of his descent was thinned not alone by his own individual age, -but as well by the age of his race; which, like all noble strains of animals, had been degenerated, by the breeding "in and in"--as it is termed among farmers-to which it had for so, many centuries been studiously insulated by the jealous exclusiveness of grandee pride. You perceived, too, that although  the general morale and habits of the modern Spaniard had in addition contributed much to this declension. of the more manly virtues, yet manner, that "last best gift" of gentle descent, had not yet passed away, along with the chastened beauty of person to which we have so often alluded. Indeed, it seems that not alone "the pregnant hinges of the knee," but as well every other "joint and motive" of the body, must be cultivated through generations, amid the graceful flections of courtly scenes, before they can attain once more to the true expressions of natural politeness which have been so coarsely degenerating since Adam, through our debasing vices! -When the manners of civilization become polite once more, we may look for Eden scenes returning! CHAPTER   II. THE group turned from the great gate, and hand to hand they promenaded the long room to the slow stately step of the old knight, whose tawny and deep-seamed face-shone with delight as he listened to the lively and artless prattle ,  *    ;-  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC8245-00000037"/> 72           GABBIELLE: of his daughter. -Sometimes they would pause for a moment before one of her flower-pots, or rather great marble vases, in which they grew--ranged along beneath the frequent- windows of the room, while Gabrielle, loosing her hold of the two hands which held hers, would bound away to bend over her pet,'like some guardian sprite, to inspect its condition or caress it with her dainty lips; then springing back to her place between her emulous admirers with a light, coquettish movement and ringing laugh, they would pass on. The old Castilian seemed supremely happy, and -to have laid aside the cares of state in earnest for the time, while the gallant Juan, as might be conjectured, realized the promised beatitudes of the seventh heaven in the flesh, with the reality of a dark-eyed Hourie for his guide. The time for the evening ride had now come, and two stout Peones were seen leading the horses to the door. Darting away through the great gate into the interior for a moment, the Senorita Gabrielle appeared equipped for the saddle. A light pink jacket of silk, jingling with many rows of small silver buttons and tiny links, had been put on over the boddice of the white gauze robe she wore; the "' rebesos," or vail for the head, without which' no Mexican maiden goes into the open air, was clasped beneath the chin with a delicate emerald brooch. Over the rebesos, which was of the lightest gossamer texture, and is considered more particularly as ap-' pertaining to the walking costume, she wore a light "gipsy hat,"' whic4 only differed from that with us, in having the conical-shaped crown belonging to the "sombrero" of the men, and in being somewhat differently ornamented, with a broad band of fantastically grouped and coloured beads. Her small yet voluptuously rounded figure was admirably set off by this picturesque costume. The horses of the two were held with difficulty as they approached. Hers was a beautiful little mare of the Mustang or wild Arab race, peculiar to the continent since Cortez   THE WHTE 'IARE 'OF CHHUAHUA.     73 introduced it here. It was white as the driven snow, with the exception of a small- spot of red bay on each ear; and as is always the case with white horses of the true Arab breed, its skin was white also, though showing through the close hair a rich creamy deepening of colour. The head was thin and small, with nostrils of vast width showing red within; and though somewhat long and angular in its outlines, the ears were most delicately diminutive and tapering, the large blue vivacious eyes stood-out prominently as those of a startled antelope, while the voluminous and wavy veil of the mane which flooded the forehead and fell likea cataract of daz- zling white from the delicate arch of the neck nearly to the ground, was only rivalled by the full and flowing splendour of the tail. The unshod hoof of unusual roundness was almost shrouded by the graceful length of -the fetlocks. The legs, which appeared as you approached in front to be slim almost as those of the deer, presented, as you saw them from the side, a broad bone with sinews swelling like whip-cord, but seeming taut as steel, and as if they would make metallic twangings as she bounded. The shoulder was thin but broad and high, and the long hamstrings reminded you of those of that miracle of speed, the great-eared' rabbit of the plains. She had Sbmething of the ragged outline of the Arab in the hind-quarters, which were high, and would have been too an- gular for beauty had she- been low in flesh; but, high con- ditioned now in her glistening coat, there was -nothing to detract from that closest approach to absolute symmetry of which this blood, without at all diminishing its wonderful endurance and speed, is capable. She looked, with her short ears, fiercely gentle eye, her quick-arched neck, her thin and mighty bones, her steeldlike cords, her chest of the- female panther, her small, flat iron hoofs and wide-flowing mane and tail, most like some hait-winged creature of a genei's spell, summoned to chase his truant winds upon; and now that she had been tamed to human ken, the bright Gabrielle, with her  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC8245-00000038"/> 74     'GABRTFIT LF: sylph-like form and most etherial voluptuousness, looked the best framed, to mount the wizard palfrey. The horse of Juan was, of course, larger than this mare, and it is sufficient to say was a very fine animal of the same stock, though it was worthy of more particular notice for a peculiarity of colours, which is alwars emulated by the young men of Mexico, whether of high or low degree. They all pride themselves upon the strangeness and variety of the markings of their favourite steeds. They are crossed with great care, with the view of obtaining the strongest possible contrast of colours in the motless blotches and spots of the skin. Many of them are very curious and beautiful. Such was the case with this animal, which was covered upon a white ground with deep reddish-black or dark umber spots, of small, but irregular size and shape, with a long, white mane, and tail as snowy, except that, curiously enough, a large tuft of coal-black hair burst streaming from its centre down to the extreme. They were gayly caparisoned in the semi-barbaric style peculiar to Mexico, the dress-saddles being plated before and- behind with a great quantity of silver, and the grotesque and peculiar ornament of the coraza, or seat-cover, being likewise embossed with silvery thread upon fine leather, while the cola 'de pato, or housings, of the same material and make, covered the haunches; and the bridles, with their heavy bits of solid silver, jingled with rows of little bells of the same metal. The head-pieces and reins were decked with bunches of horse-hair dyed with the scarlet cochineal of the country. The armas de pelo, formed of the long and silken fleece of the Rocky Mountain goat, dyed of the same colour, and richly bordered with embossed leather, hung down from the -high pommel of the saddle, and formed an occasional cpver- ing for the leg of the rider when mounted. The fairy senorita sprang lightly to her seat with little assistance from her lover, who wasquickly at her side, jin-   THE WHTE MARE OF CHHUAHUA .      75 gling his enormous spurs of solid silver as he mounted, and the horses keeping time with their silver bells, as they dashed off merrily; and now the rumbling of heavy wheels was heard, and the chariot of the old governor rolled heavily through the great gate of the court. It was driven by a smoke-dried peone seated in front, and drawn by four pale-dun mules, very tall, with slim and well-proportioned bodies, while their fine round limbs were striped with small black marks, which seemed continuations of the larger stripe which traversed the back to the tail, down even which it was faintly continued. The chariot was a very clumsy and primitive affair, though there had bben considerable effort at a rude sort of decora- tion, much in keeping with that of the horse-furniture I have described. The spirited team moved in a very brisk trot, and soon the parties were in motion together, the two young people, at a slow gallop, keeping alongside the window of the chariot, to exchange a word now and then with the did governor. As its blood -warmed by the motion, the fiery little palfrey of Gabrielle, becoming impatient of such slow procedure, darted ahead, with ears laid back, like a frolicsome pan- theress, while she, looking behind, waved a laughing farewell to her father, and resigned herself fearlessly to the mood of her spoiled and petted favourite. Juan joined her, and away they went, like two glad wild birds together, singing on the wing, while the old governor looked wistfully after them, as they swiftly disappeared around-a turn of the road, and then settled himself in his chariot with a smile of benignant -and happy complacency. As he thus threw himself back upon the moss-stuffed cushions, lie gave himself up to well-satisfied speculations concerning the precise value of his neighbour's estate, about to be thus ceded to his own, and to splendid, visions of a green and honoured old age, surrounded with all the power of great wealth and influence, and with lovely grandchildren added to fill up the measure of his bliss.  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC8245-00000039"/> 76          GAB RIEtTE: This was a delicious evening, unusually so even for the equable and mild temperature of this climate. The sun was near to setting, and its mellow rays fell in long, slanting lines through the huge arms of the moss-draped live-oaks, and touched now, and then the venerable head within, through the open windows of the coach, with a golden salutation and a soft farewell, that spoke of peace and hope. The sounds of the evening, which are very few here, and these exceed- ingly sweet and low, had just commenced to fill the air with a slumberous lullaby, which,- with its charming drowse, soothed the- old man to a half sleep, filled with pleasant images, while the coach rolled smoothly, as along a floor, over the level road. The monody of nature, which was creeping upon his ear, seemed to' him the musical receding of the dear voice of his daughter, fading'as she went; and as the sleepy choir of evening rose in higher strains, it seemed to him that loved sound returning again inr merry mood to meet him. But the old man opened his eyes quickly, and with a convulsive start, as the driver, in a shrill pipe, screamed into his horrified ear, "Los Indios/! los Indios! los Apache!" and without waiting for any order, wheeled his team of mules, and with frantic eagerness commenced lashing them into full speed down the road toward the,mansion. 'The stricken old man, as the coach was turning, caught one-glimpse of a sight that, with his knowledge of that coun- try, was enough. It was that of the horse of Juan, with head tossed on high, and streaming mane, rushing after them ' riderless, and wild- with fright. The horse soon passed in its panic-stricken speed, and as it went by, the horrified old man saw blood upon the splendid saddle, and t was 4wounded by several arrows, which still remaine sticking in its body. About the meaning of these appalling signs there could be nq mistake, and the frightened driver lashed his mules   THE WHTE MARE OF CHHUAHUA.

The dreadful war-whoop was sounding in his ears, and the clatter of pursuing hoofs grew more distinct each instant. There was no time for -,looking back; none for any thing, indeed, but the most headlong speed. Now the mansion is in sight.     If the great gate be not thrown open in time, they are lost. On! on! rushed the goaded team. The headway is too great; they cannot pause. Arrows begin to whistle past the ears of the screaming and despairing Peone.

The gate swings suddenly back; 'they are safe; and, as the gate is slammed, with a baffled howl the dark warriors swerve past like a flight of hawks that have missed their quarry on the swoop.  The' old man springs to the ground in the court, and rushing through it with all the energy of youth, calls his people to arms.   He passes through into the summer-room, to look after the retiring foe. They are just passing out of view beneath the great oaks; and he sees, among their dusky forms the flutter of white drapery, -and  rearing furiously in the effort to escape, he recognises a snow-white palfrey, with long, flowing mane and tail. The poor old man falls heavily to the marble floor.          .   &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC8245-00000040"/> 78          GABRIELLE: CHAPTER III. THE country called Northern Mexico is in many respects peculiar, but in no other is it more entirely anomalous than in its general topographical features. It really seems to be all. at sixes and sevens with the rest of the continent. Its rivers, instead of running east, west, or south, as is the case with our other rivers, coolly turn tail upon them eall, and very independently rush away toward the north. Whether, this is the result of a hauteur of temper which scorns the company of "common folk;" we cannot tell, though sure it is they have nothing in particular to brag of, except this and a few other eccentricities. But there are some odd fashions these have, which are, if any thing, still more unaccountable. . There is the little Rib Grandetof Durango, the Rio Nazos, and the Rio Patos, which, with the most unusual and extraordinary originality, start out upon their own hook, from the bowels of the rude Sierra Madre, and after flashing in foam-lightning with zigzag leap- '  ing down the steep bare rocks, and rumbling through the deep canons beneath, subside within a hundred miles or so into beautiful lakes, of comparatively small size, and having no apparent outlets. What the meaning of all this fussy parade is, we leave it for sages to determine; but if we were left to conjecture, it would be that it was got up simply for the sake of making a fuss for the pure love of it; for those sombre old mountains have quick ears, we tel yol0. while they stand listening silently, up in the blue, crisp ar, to the glad, glittering, tink- ling dash of the merry waters, giddy with the joy of freedom   TH'E WHTE MARE OF CHHUAHUA.      79 and the light, as they go tinily shouting down their rugged sides; and then, when the morning comes, haloing with the aurora their white frosty brows, they, with commendable vanity, love to see themselves looking at the best, and, on tiptoe, seem to lean and peer at the giant reflexes those small bright lakes give forth. Ha! ha! the jolly old boys! what a toilet is theirs, when their hair of knotty laurels and the rough mesquite has just been combed by the hurricane, and all their white powder whirled off glistening into the thin air! When they look down into the mirrors at their feet they are amazed, you may rest assured, to see themselves looking so young, and, like punctilious, old-fashioned gentlemen, as they are, sadly taken aback at the idea of appearing at court before the sun, without the complement of hair-powder which etiquette requires! But the fitful winds that make their toilet ,will soon be along; and not the- down of cygnets is so soft and white as those fleecy clouds they bring, and no footfall of minister of air so dimly musical as their flakes while they fall!   m We mentioned at the beginning, that the Hacienda En- cinnillas was situated on a tributary of the Conebas: we should have qualified this assertion somewhat, by saying that it was rather conjectured to be a tributary than known to be so; for, as the mysterious Lake Patos, in which this little river lost itself, had no visible outlets, it is natural to suppose that it must have an invisible one, or else, as it is no miracle in point of size, it might be reasonably expected to run over some day. As this "se  daysas never come yet, it was quite as natural to supqs  t never would; and considering it was near the COnc h4,which, as it was the largest, was certainly the most self-willh proportionably, of all the droll rivers in this droll country, why might it not have something to do in the affair?"Why," it might be pertinently asked, "since the Conchas, like another great river, the Nile, in the 'far countries' has "taken the fancy to  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC8245-00000041"/> 80          GABRIELLE: run north, while all the rest of the world runs south, should it not as well be a pipe-laying politician, and have under- ground tributaries which would darkly and secretly work to swell its importance?" The thing seems plain. However, whether right or wrong, the Patos River and Lake are pretty generally considered as underhand contributors to the rather turbulent-importance of the Conchas! On the morning after the occurrences we have related, the shores of this little Lake Patos were thronged with a strange assemblage. On the southern side, where its shores were stupendously abrupt, with the exception of a narrow beach at the foot of the cliffs, this curious mass was rushing along the sand, and stretched like a rabble army nearly a mile in length. Such bellowing and pushing as there was in that great herd of brown, black, and white cattle, all mingled, whoI urged by the sharp lances of their Indian captors, gored, roared, and butted, throwing out their heels, pitching, tum- bling, and trampling each other in the wildest panic of pain and rage! Their fierce captors, as they passed the fallen, re- lentlessly lanced and left them writhing on the ground. Then came a thousand mules, and nearly as many horses, rearing, plunging, biting, snorting, leaping, and kicking, in a sort of pent-up stampede, for they could not break through the heavy and compact masses before them, nor could they get by without rushing into the lake. Then came a curious jumble of Indians mixed up with their Mexican prisoners, and hundreds of mules laden with plunder of every kind-articles of which were strewing the sands at nearly every stride they made. Then came the main body of the robbers, half a mile in the rear, and consisting of over two hundred warriors, darker than any of the southern tribes, naked to thy clout; and wearing horse-tail cues attached to their long, hair, and streaming on the wind behind. Their lances were ornamented with horse-hair, as also their bridles, which were plaited and tufted with it; and their rawhide quirts   THE WHTE, MARE OF CHHUAHUA.      81 had the same appendages. To increase the spirit, if not the spirituality of the scene, these wild devils were yelling like a   herd of whlves with the staggering preyin view, only that the voice of the human monster was more terrifically hoarse and alarming. Suddenly the lead of this headlong mass diverged toward the-lake, and such a splashing! The hundreds of " browns" were followed by the hundreds- of "blacks," and then the hundreds of "whites" capped, like horned foam, the waves of the startled lake. Then came the mules and horses, and even some animals, bearing the Mexican prisoners, rushed in with their screaming burdens. So strong is the propensity among beasts of all grades to follow the lead! It was how rather a peculiar sight, it must be confessed, that placid lake, that seemed ever to have slept beneath the eyes of stars and shadows of great rocks, suddenly invoked by this wild tumult of heads and horns, of snorts and sneezes, bellowings, plunges, rearing, shrieking, winding up with horrid yells as the rear-guard of warriors came up and boldly plunged their horses into the lake, and, urging them through the now tumultuous water, struck out to drive back the refractory drove. Many were drowned, but it was not long before the great body were turned in toward the shore, and were seen meekly wading back through the near shallows, and showing them- selves tame as drowned rats.  It is not to be supposed that these audacious warriors had been urging this mad rout because they were afraid of pur- suit or of their pursuers, by any means. How that is, you will probably perceive soon; but you may rest assured this whole affair was entirely a matter of common usage and de- liberate calculation with them. They knew well that the wild and frightened animals they had thus unceremoniously appropriated would be unruly customers to manage in driving as they were, and that it was necessary to teach F  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC8245-00000042"/> 82          GABRT TT, them some manners at the outset; so they cunningly chose this long beach, where they knew it was impossible for them to break but in one direction, and that one the best calcu- lated to cool off their surplus vehemence-into the lake! When once on the beach there was no escape: they had either to be goaded in the manner we have described, through the whole tedious length of some .fifteen miles, when they would be thoroughly used up, or else they must take to the water, either Qf which alternatives would have, as they 'well knew, the desired effect! Now by the time the swimming warriors reached the sands, all dripping as they were, they marshalled their humble and drooping victims into double herds, which walked meekly on, not needing the goad of lance or frightening yell. -But amid all the noise and confusion attendant upone such an event as this we have just witnessed, there was one party of four warriors which stood fast, immovably watching the scene. They bore between them, as they sat upon their horses, a rude kind of litter, composed of a buffalo-robe stretclied between two lances, and another above thrown over the arches formed by two withes of green boughs lashed across to each of the lances, and at both ends. What was held in this curious litter was not so apparent, although the- flutter of a white garment occasionally, within, might have rendered it suspicious that we had seen or heard of the owner before; and more especially, since you discovered, in the thickest and most tumultuous part of the throng, a small, and snow-white mare, with flowing mane and tail, which was kicking, biting, and leaping here and there like an enraged pantheress, thus managing to add no little spirit to her part of the scene, and give some trouble at least to the youthful, but comely young warrior who bestrode her, side-saddle and all! She seemed wild with furious indignation, and snorted her wrath and neighed her scorn at the filthy barbarians that were presuming to profane her silken hide with their Of   THE WHTE MARE OF CHHUAHUA.       83 vulgar touch, and lashed out her heels with savage emphasis, 1 and without distinction, at all who presumed to approach her. She-had already bitten several warriors or their horses, and lance after lance had been i levelled at her side, but as her bold young rider always assumed-the attitude of defence for his prize, their owners had finally concluded to give her a wide berth and let her alone. When they plunged into the lake, she came very near taking her rider "out to sea " for she clenched the bit in her teeth, and started out across the water for the other shore, four miles distant; and when the young warrior attempted to check her up, she plunged and went under very deep with the most vixenish desperation, as if determined to drown him off, or drown herself, and thus get rid of her ignominy. But he was not to be baffled, and, with wonderful coolness, (his bath had made him cool if he had not been so otherwise,) he held her head above water, 'and, in spite of her struggles, urged her toward the shore. When arrived there, instead of being tempered down as the other animals were, she commenced rearing and plunging among the disordered crowd, even more ungovernable than before. She made her way through the throng of cattle, by leaping over the backs of some with most astonishing bounds, that would have unseated any other rider than a Southern Indian or an Arab, and by dashing out most furiously, or biting them, until she had carried her rider, "1whether-or-no," through the divisions of the White and black, and reached that, of the shaggy browns. Here she began to behave better; and the young warrior, who had been absolutely sweating with his exertions to  "keep her on the wind," began apparently to console himself that the trouble was all over, when, to his great astonishment and discomfiture, she all at once lifted her head, and, with a wild shrill neigh, cleared in swift successive bounds the backs of three or four of these great shaggy brutes, and then, with head down and nose before, nearly dragging the poor warrior off, she rushed 13  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC8245-00000043"/> 84          G 'GABRIELLE: through-the crowding herd; and then, with a strange, eager cry as they got through, leaped' over the back of a burden mule, and stopped so suddenly as to pitch the unfortunate young fellow violently forward and nearly over her neck, with his head thrust into the opening of that unique litter of buffalo-robes, concerning which we have spoken. The scream of terror that followed, and his look of grin- ning delight as he regained his reins and seat,: were not far from comical, to say the least; but what was absolutely so, at,  was the whinnying ecstasy with which the little mare thrust ! .p her fine head into the same place, though more gently, and iT  begged a recognition from her lawful mistress; and, further- Vi   more, it was not a little comical to see the unavailing efforts I   of the laughing young warrior to get her away from that im- mediate vicinity, after her fair mistress, who had been some- what reassured by the appearance of that familiar nose, had stroked and kissed it, and spoken some familiar words of en-, dearment. The young warrior, after various desperate efforts, finding it was of no avail to try to get away from that litter, seemed to resign himself to \his fate, and now rode quietly along in its rear. Thus it pressed on, this wild, tumultuous mass. Lake after lake was passed, whose sunlines roughly broken by the wild invasion, set all the solemn mountain-tops dancing in their bosoms, like colossal shadows in fantastic wake above the death of ancient solitude. They tossed their hairy arms about in many a measured wave, nodding their white heads seriously and slow, while far beneath their huge limbs flashed in quick and zigzag antics, that seemed strangely limber for such grave and stiff-kneed watchers of the storms. Perhaps their stout, unbending natures had yielded their venerable proprieties to grief, that the deep bosom of this quiet they so long had guarded was thus being robbed of its informing presence-of its fairest incarnation-the lightsome, joyous, and gentle Gabrielle, whose-delicate spirit had   THE WHTE MARE OF CHIIUAHUA.      85 humnanized fhem all, and whose regal will had bound them as her'servitors, held by the imperious etiquette-of her ma- jestic court to breathe not over loud themselves, nor let the uncivil winds dare more than whisper on their pipes a drowsy undertone-that' all the rocks and waters of that wreck- piled, caverned earth, might hear the mellowest ripple of her silvery laugh, and soothe their bristling horrors into the ver- nal smiles of a perpetual- peace. Alas, alas, ye cold-nosed mountains! well may the slow teardrops, now trickling from many an eyelid spring adown your rugged points, freeze in funereal pendence, glistening aloft in that icy, desert air, the which the soft radiance of her spring-like smiles may never soothe and thaw again! She has been reft from thee--she is departing! Are not thy moveless pinnacles all tottering with the weight of sorrow even now?   In thy wild wrath, may they not be hurled be- neath, upon the doomed wjr-crest of that black and savage herd, that would thus ravage all thy joy away? Thou troubled lakes, whose crystal quiet has been thus profaned, deep in- the cavernous chambers of thy mystery, hast thou no pent-up fioods to loosen overwhelming on this sacrilegious rout, that ye may bear her on the white mare, triumphing on the unsoiled crest of your 'white-foaming strength? Alas, alas, the flinty heart of mountains and the torpid power of those dumb lakes, they are yet unmoved! May the genii of those baffled storms possess them both hereafter with-wildest throes. The angel of their old-time peace has vanished! Gabrielle, the fair Gabrielle, has passed away! She has been torn from their midst, their guardian arms all unresisting! Though deserted by her natal guardians, the power of lake and wood, rock and stream, the fair Gabrielle retained at least one fast and faithful friend in the -beautiful white mare. of Chihuahua; who, having by this time taught her  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC8245-00000044"/> 86          GABRIELLE: swarthy captors that her will was to be law, now, with her nose close against the litter, followed demurely with droop- ing ears, and large eyes melancholy-moist, seeming to respond from her deep chest in sighs to every sob of the frail pri- soner within, who, forgetful of aught else, strove, yet in vain, through -closed lids, to shut out some gory spectacle that would rise up, bearing the form, scalpless and torn, of her own gallant Juan. Poor child! poor child.! She thought not of her dread- ful future. The past brought darkness and horror enough to ker faint heart. Still it rushed on-that ruthless herd, and roar and yell, and clang of lance and shield yet mingled in dull and dread- ful monody upon her listless ear. Still the white mare clung close beside her--still the young chief had failed to move her wilful, dogged faith-still 'those white ears dropped-still that deep chest heaved with mute and pent-up wrath, and the funereal trail of her white mane and tail swept the curt brown sod. Night came-and still the troubled mass rolled on beneath the pitiless stars and the cold, staring moon-no pause, no rest was there. The bellowings of the goaded herds were only now and then rendered less distinct by the shrill shrieks and outcries that told how the ferocious robbers had turned aside to strike some new hacienda near their path, or sweep fresh victims from the pillaged suburbs of defenceless villages, to hurl them onward in the turbid rush of the dark flood they urged before them to their mountain home. The -morning came--and a more general wail uprose from all the shaking land they trampled, and a great concourse of prisoners--weeping as she wept, and for many another scalped and gory Juan, too-swelled the long, mournful train of fairest Gabrielle. Suddenly, as with a great shock7 all this bewildered tumult   THE WHTE MARE OF, CHHUAHUA.     '87 Powas stilled. The insolent marauders had paused before the very gates of the city of Chihuahua-and leaving a few of their number to guard their prisoners and plunder, charged, howling their fierce .war-whoops, rattling their shields and  lances against each other, upon a force of some five hundred regulars, constituting the garrison of the city, which was issuing from the open gates with characteristic pomp and- bluster to punish the aggressors. These flaunting, ferocious champions of New   Mexican honour, scarcely awaited the charge of less than three hundred half-naked savages, but,- breaking instantly, were driven hack in panic-struck confusion to the wide-open gates of their city, their dreaded foes enter- ing pell-mell with them. The lieutenant-colonel to whom the gallant old Governor Gonzaleze had intrusted the sole command during his retire- ment at his hacienda, had been first to lead forth his tinselled troops to meet this wild band; and, with equal promptness and activity, had proved the first to enter, not only the gates of the city, in this shameful retreat, but the first as well to reach the shelter of the citadel. Fortunately, their foes held the environment of walls in deep aversion, and did not venture to penetrate so far as the citadel, of which, no. doubt, they might have possessed them- selves with equal ease, in the panic. At the sound of the escopets, which a few stragglers had nervously fired into the air in their retreat, the white mare of Chihuahua had pricked her ears, and darting forward with a shrill snort, had succeeded,- by the suddenness of her move- ment, in unseating her tenacious rider, and then, with the speed of an arrow from the bow, her wild hair singing in the wind  s she had darted with fierce neighings through the crowded gate, and held her way, trampling and overturning ,very thing opposed, direct to the citadel, into the accustomed courts of which she rushed, plunging and foaming like some wizard, wild thing, broken loose.  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC8245-00000045"/> 88      :    GABRIELLE: Nothing could restrain her furious neighings, and as the gates were now closed, the gallant colonel was soon made aware of her presence. The cheek of .the chivalrous Don Diez turned yet a shade paler, and his long, silken moustache quivered still more pal- pably, as he recognised the favourite palfrey of Senorits Gabrielle, yet fully caparisoned, showing full plainly that evil had oome to her whom he well knew to be as more than the apple of the -eye to his indulgent master, the old Governor Gonzaleze. She must be a prisoner to this wild horde-and now a double disgrace stared upon him like a death's head, should he do nothing to rescue her. No excuse could save him now, no lying bombast of reported prodigies of valour could avail him now. No swaggering bulletins from imaginary fields of blood would divert that' old father's heart from the stern questioning which would demand her-his life--his child!- the child of his old age--at his hands. - The recreant felt that indeed something must be done to save appearances; and instantly, with loud gasconading, he ordered the white palfrey to be equipped for him-for his own warrior seat-that upon it alone he would lead them forth to die a thousand deaths, or to the rescue of their mistress. The Apaches had now left the town, and for hours and hours the chivalrous knight galloped hither and yon about the city, collecting his scattered heroes, thus managing to waste the precious time within, which it might safely be con- jectured that the foe, he was thus ferociously bent upon ex- terminating, could -have reached a security beyond the possi- bility of pursuit, within/,the fastnesses of the neighbouring Anahuac mountains. But his swarthy foe, meanwhile, proved to be in no hurry to gain- this desirable shelter; and after loitering for some time plundering the suburbs and insultingly challenging the garrison to come forth and fight them upon open ground, 9    THE WHTE MARE OF CHlHUAHUA.     89 they at length leisurely moved on with their encumbered train, sending forth many a bitter taunt and defiance to pursue. When they were at length safely out of sight, and even miles away, the gallant Lieutenant-colonel Diez came forth, all renewed in burnished splendour, leading his valorous force of green and gold-laced chivalry. The white palfrey that he rode seemed verily snorting flames, so eager was she chafing to plunge away at once upon the wild pursuit. And now the drama hastens to a close. Hours have passed, and it nears evening. The listless Apaches, who are gorged at last with rapine and with blood, are slowly moving, in a long, straggling, careless line, toward the entrance of the first defile into the sheltering mountains. Some, half asleep, bend forward, resting with their shields upon the brooding necks of their jaded steeds. Others, in feckless attitudes, gossip in groups as they walk lounging beside their horses. A deep and tangled chaparral stretches on either side, from the mouth of the defile out into the plain. The advance-guard of warriors has already entered the pass, while behind them, stretching for more than a mile, follows the scattered train of stolen herds, and after these the loose phalanx of their prisoers, tied upon horses and mules, or straggling on foot-the precious litter of which we have spoken, alone being guarded, on the extremest rear. Then came the lounging rear-guard of some fifty apathetic warriors, when, -as'they were about entering the defile, a thumping and irregular discharge 'of escopets, from the chaparral on either side, told of an ambush--when the listless warriors, like drowsy wild-hawks to the clash of coming wings, are on the instant wide enough awake, and bending for the stoop, glance fiercely round them for the coming foe. Shot after shot burst dully, thumping round them; and yet no harm seems done, no warrior falls, nor even starts with sudden wound-when suddenly, with a loud, derisive  &#xD;<pb n="90-91 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC8245-00000046"/> '90         GABRrTLTF.: laugh, they wheeled and darted back, to turn the chaparral on either side, and rout the foe their scorn had so surely recognised.          - It was but a moment, and the chivalrous knights of Mexico were seen scurrying, in sad disarray, hither and yon across the open plain, back for Chihuahua, far faster than they came. But :see! yon gayly plumed knight, who leads the frantic rout, has suddenly wheeled from out the press, and is darting back alone, upon his snow-white steed, as if in shame and scorn he left the coward rabble, to expiate with his own gentle blood this foul blot upon the high chivalry of Spain, or with his own puissant arm singly to rescue the fair prisoner in yon guarded litter. It is the gallant Diez! Who but he? Mark what a falcon flight he flies! How direct is that fell'swoop he makes! Shall 'his swarthy foes stand up before him? Dare they abide his fearful coming? See, he is upon them! Their, warrior ranks are opened. Hark as he passes! was that a wild yell of 'derision? + That furious neigh of his fiery steed, --those tremendous vaultings! Hah! Lieutenant-colonel Diez is' unseated by his snowy steed-his foot drags in the stirrup-fiercely lashing. his prostrate form with her heel, the white mare of Chihuahua drags his lifeless body over the plain, through, around, and amid the jeering warriors, who will not deign to honour all that fallen- chivalry with one good, honest weapon-thrust. And so this fierde knight died without one warrior wound. Alas! alas! The rout now disappeared within the deep defile, and the fair Gabrielle and her milk-white 'wizard palfrey have passed from before our vision! It may be for ever-we shall see!

A new, full, and complete Concordance; Illustrated with monumental, traditional, and oriental engravings, founded on Butterworth's, with Cruden's definitions; forming, it is believed, on many accounts, a more valuable work than either Boutterworth, Crudefi, or any other similar book in the, language. The value of a Concordance is now generally understood; and those who have used one, oo'n- sider it indispensable in connection with the Bible. 2. A Guide to the Reading and Study of the Bible; being Carpenter's valuable Biblical Companion, lately published in London, containing a complete history of the Bible, and forming a most excellent introduction to its study. It embraces the evi- dences of Christianity, Jewish antiquities, manners, customs, arts, natural history, dw., of the Bible, with notes and engravings added. 8. Complete Biographies of Henry, by Williams; Scott, by his son ; Doddridge, by Orton; *. : ' with sketches of the lives and characters , and notices Of the works,-of the writers on the Scriptures who are quoted in the Commentary, living and dead, American and foreign., This part of the volume not only affords a large quantity of interesting and useful reading for pious familiest but will also be a source of gratification to all those who are in the habit of consult ing the Commentary; every one naturally feeling a desire to know some particulars of the lives and characters of those whose opinions he seeks. Appended to this part, will be a BIBLIOTHECA BIBLICA, or list;of the best works on the Bible, of all kinds, arranged under their appropriate heads. 4. A complete Index of the Matter contained in the Bible Text. 5. A Symbolical Dictionary. A very comprehensive and valuable Dictionary of Scripture Symbols, (ooccupying about flty-as closely prined pages,) by Thomas Wemyss, (author of "iblica Gleanings," Ac) Comprising Daubuz, Lancaster, Hutcheson, fec: 6. The Work contains several other Articles, Indexes, Tables, &amp;c. &amp;c., and is, 7. Illustrated by a large Plan of Jerusalem, identifying, as far as tradition, &amp;o., go; the original sites, drawn on the spot by F. Catherwood, of London, architect. Also, two steel engravings Of portraits of seven foreign and eight, American theological writers, and numerous wood engravings. The whole forms a desirable and necessary fund of instruction for the use not only of clergymen and Sabbath-school teachers, but also for families When the great amount of matter it must contain is considlered,'it will be deemed exceedingly cheap. "I have examined ' Thb Companioa to the Bible,'and have been surprised to find o much inform- ation introduced into a volume of so moderate a size. It contains a library of sared knowledge and criticism.- It will be useful to ministers who own large libraries. and cnn01 fail to be an invaluable help to every reader of the Bible."
