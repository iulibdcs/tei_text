               <salute>TO MY FATHER:—</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN the enthusiasm of composition (when these pages seemed more worthy than they now
               do), I had resolved to offer them to you. But, under the cool review just given them,
               their merits have strangely paled—their faults grown sadly palpable; and I find
               myself writing a letter of deprecation, rather than dedication!</p>
            <p>The eye of affection is quick to detect a blemish, where it desires perfection; and
               you, my most partial critic, may be the least merciful. If I have failed to satisfy
               your wishes as an author, forget that I am such, and think of me only as a daughter.
               I hope, that, however much I may deserve correction in the one capacity, my loyal
               impulses, and instincts, have preserved me from error in the other.</p>
            <p>I can only add, if there be anything in this little book which gives you pleasure,
               accept it as a tribute of gratitude for care, and culture, bestowed upon</p>

            <p>CERTAIN fanciful, and unreal, visiters having intruded upon occasional hours of
               solitude, with a persistence which defies all efforts for relief, I have been
               constrained to give them form and permanence, and send them trooping forth,
               commissioned to invade other sanctuaries, to importune other minds. Engaged upon a
               wider field of action, they return no more; and peace may have been earned, unless,
               indeed, a "swarm more hungry" succeeds them.</p>
            <p>I can make no other apology for offering the public this crude result, of interludes
               of loneliness, and leisure. If, in the roar of more stirring scenes of the life
                  drama<pb n="viii-9 (Table of Contents) " xml:id="VAC5981-00000005"/> appointed me,
               I have sometimes lost the tones of those inner voices, and given but faint and feeble
               echoes to the world, my punishment must be in the knowledge that these pages will
               fail to afford a pleasure to the reader, as deep and pure as that which they
               yielded</p>

               <p>THERE is a spot in Pennsylvania's wide-spread landscape that deeply impressed my
                  childish heart, and occasionally haunts my maturer memory with its romantic
                  beauty. I have dwelt much upon it in thought, and drawn large draughts therefrom
                  in hours of silence and solitude, until the contemplation has engendered a feeling
                  of proprietorship in this domain of loveliness, which nature has bestowed upon her
                  children. Here have I installed my Fancy, saying, "Be thou<pb n="14-15"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000008"/> heir. Go thou in and posses! Let thy creations
                  multiply and people this wide domain, unchecked by mossy landmarks, uncontrolled
                  by musty title papers, and unreproved by ancient ownerships."</p>
               <p>In older days and other climes, the elfin fays danced gayly on the greensward, or
                  trooped through moonlit wood, with right to "<foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >vert</foreign>" unquestioned by the grim Gothic owners. Perchance the modern
                  lords of the soil may admit my Fancy to this unreal partnership, with a like
                  courtesy, smiling indulgently, as they recognise the appropriation of their fair
                  acres by the squattership of a vagrant mind. Fancy is a sprite that flits unseen,
                  leaving behind no superstitious horrors to haunt the ground she visits. She is a
                  light-footed Ariel, making no print in fairy rings, to tell where she hath held
                  high revel! Lo! she spreadeth her wing and taketh flight to the Susquehanna.</p>
               <p>Oh, Susquehanna, beautiful and beloved! Thou Helicon of my soul! Would that I
                  might stand once more upon thy banks, and draw from thy fair waters their
                  unfailing inspiration! That I might refresh my heart with one look upon thy
                  loveliness, ere I essay to portray it. Memory looketh back upon thee through a dim
                  mist of tears. Aerial Fancy floateth upon thy bosom, and she shall be the
                  prompter.</p>
               <p>Look away then to the north, oh Memory! Meet, with clearer eye, the expanse of
                  translucent waters, calmly sweeping on its course by hill and plain, forest and
                  town. Turn ye westward, and greet another flood in its coming, rapidly rushing,
                  like an impetuous bridegroom to meet the bride. Look, thou upon their union, as,
                  with commingled tides, two mighty rivers roll their tribute to the eastern ocean.
                  The bold bluff of the ancient mountain looks down upon them with a blessing—the
                  sinking sun is translated in a chariot of fire, and, like the departing prophet,
                  casts his mantle upon them, and the united floods glow with golden glory. The
                  evening winds sing of peace, and the awakened leaves of the forest, like a
                  thousand whispering tongues, echo <emph>peace.</emph> One by one, the stars step
                  forth upon the porticoes of heaven, proclaiming, "We stand upon the threshold of
                  eternal <emph>peace:</emph>" and <emph>peace</emph> enfolds thee with a great
                  calm, oh turbulent world!</p>
               <p>The mountain bluff, like an ancient sybarite, laves his luxurious feet in the
                  bright waters. The clouds of heaven, whereon God's mystic truths are written, he
                  binds as phylacteries upon his brow. High above the river towers his rocky head,
                  crowned with old oaks and pines, that have rocked and roared in the winds of many
                  winters. On the edge of the precipice, in wild companionship with hoary rocks and
                  primeval forest trees, with its bold roof sharply defined against the sky, and a
                  coronet of stars crowning its gable, stands a human dwelling.</p>
               <p>Truly it is built upon a rock! Though the spirit of peace be abroad to-night, it
                  is not always thus; memory recalls when the powers of darkness and storm seemed
                  leagued for its destruction. When the winds blew around the presumptuous tenement
                  and the waves beat upon the foot of its precipitous foundation, yet it fell
                  not.</p>
               <p>To this wild embodiment of a wild thought, I have given<pb n="16-17"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000009"/> the name of "The Eyrie," although it is widely
                  known by another epithet, expressive of contempt for the building and its builder.
                  When there is aught of the poetical, the beautiful, or the good, above the
                  comprehension of man, he complacently recompenses himself by despising it. All
                  things in heaven or earth, beyond the range of his self-sufficient philosophy,
                  receive his contempt. Therefore is it that the name of that earnest soul, who made
                  his abode in this mountain fastness, and to whom nature revealed beauties hidden
                  from dull eyes, and insensate hearts, is coupled with <emph>folly.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>The summer evening deepens and darkens around the Eyrie, and when lights kindle in
                  the casements of this house built against the heavens, it seems to the fisherman's
                  daughter, as she looks up from her cabin on the shore, that new stars are set in
                  the firmament.</p>
               <p>Could the child look in upon the dark sad countenance of an eagle nature brooding
                  there, she would feel that this dwelling upon the mountain top is not, as she has
                  believed, nearer heaven than the lowlier abodes of men.</p>

               <p>THANK the Fates, or Muses, or any other occult Power to whom acknowledgments may
                  be due, our hero is a handsome man! Tall, well formed, and graceful in figure, he
                  stood by the library window. Although young, his countenance, naturally dark, had
                  grown sallow with confinement and study; but his hair, undimmed by either,
                  clustered in thick masses of short dusky curls about his broad brow. An expression
                  of sadness, which sometimes deepened into suffering, played about a mouth of
                  feminine delicacy; and his deep dark serious eyes looked melancholy
                  meditations.</p>
               <p>Nature meant Arthur Walsingham for a poet and a scholar. Circumstances had made
                  him a dreamy recluse; and, in dreamy mood, he stood by the library window, looking
                  out into the peaceful summer night.</p>
               <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC5981-00000010"/>
               <p>How long it might have held him in its thrall, this chronicle recordeth not. A
                  clatter of heavy boots, and the roll of a deep bass voice, rung out, startling the
                  Eyrie echoes. The door swung open, and a tall man, with sailor stride, entered.
                  Seizing the student's hands, he shook them with an affectionate energy that
                  threatened annihilation, exclaiming—</p>
               <p>"So, ho! Arthur! This is your roost! By George, one needs wings to reach it—wings
                  of the wind, eh! Didn't think I was this side the sea, did you?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed, I did not," responded Arthur Walsingham, warmly. "But you are thrice
                  welcome, Ben. It warms a man's heart to look upon the face of kindred;" and he
                  took the strong right hand between his own, pressing it with a fervour that
                  brought tears of pain, or tenderness, to his visiter's eyes.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Grey," said Walsingham, addressing a female who hovered curiously about the
                  open door; "Mrs. Grey, here is my brother, just returned from sea; what can we do
                  to make him comfortable?"</p>
               <p>"Cook him a hot supper of fresh things, I s'pose, sir," suggested Mrs. Grey,
                  retiring to exercise her culinary accomplishments in behalf of the stranger.</p>
               <p>This lady deemed expedition necessary in preparing a meal for one who had been so
                  long at sea; and Captain Walsingham soon found himself discussing the dainties of
                  his brother's board, with a sailor's relish.</p>
               <p>After the traveller had partaken of the refreshments provided vided by the
                  bountiful hand of Mrs. Grey, the brothers enjoyed one of those communings so
                  delightful to friends long separated. Reminiscences of boyhood, narratives of
                  experiences, and mutual inquiry, beguiled the evening.</p>
               <p>"And why is it, Arthur," said the Captain, as he toyed with the extinguisher of
                  his bed-room light; "why is it that you live in this crow's nest, like a hermit,
                  without friend, or wife, chick, or child?—chained to a rock, as it were, with
                  bachelorhood preying upon your vitals! You see, I remember the classics. Why, man!
                  you owe me a sister-in-law by this time."</p>
               <p>"I deny the debt!" retorted Walsingham, with a smile. "You owe me, rather."</p>
               <p>"Alas, for the family of Walsingham!" groaned the Captain. "I fear celibacy will
                  be the extinction of it."</p>
               <p>"It will prove the extinction of any family, if persisted in. But you, Ben, are my
                  senior. By your honest, broad shoulders should the honours of our family be
                  upheld; and with you, rests the responsibility of setting a respectable
                  Benedictine example to your junior."</p>
               <p>"I might have done so, some years ago," quoth the Captain, with an air of amused
                  perplexity; "but it is too late, now. What would I do with a wife, and my habits?
                  and, oh Jupiter! what would a wife do with me and my habits together?" and, by way
                  of illustration, he ejected the national weed upon the carpet, and deposited his
                  booted heels beside the girandoles on the mantelpiece. "Ask Mrs. White,
                  Brown—what's the colour of her name? She who made me wipe my boots<pb n="20-21"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000011"/> before I embraced my brother? Why, if I took the
                  liberty of punching the fire upon the sacred hearth of home, the mate would feel
                  called upon to sweep up the dear domestic ashes. We should fence with poker and
                  broom—I know we should! Pshaw, I'm not placid! I should explode like a falconet
                  and blow up the ship. If I ever marry, the dust-brush will haunt me like an
                  avenging angel!"</p>
               <p>Walsingham laughed at the Captain's warmth; and then, like a grateful and
                  appreciative dog as he was, expatiated upon the virtues of women.</p>
               <p>"I never affected women, you know," said Captain Walsingham; "but you, Arthur,
                  were a true <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chevalier aux dames.</foreign> I thought, of a
                  certainty, that before I returned, you would strike colours under the fire of fine
                  eyes, or find yourself ensnared by flowing ringlets, or some other mischievously
                  feminine man-trap."</p>
               <p>"My escape is miraculous, certainly, and cannot be attributed to any merit of my
                  own," answered Walsingham, dryly.</p>
               <p>Captain Ben delivered a significant "Umph." After some rummaging in a certain
                  lumber-room in his cranium, pertaining to a miserly hoarder of shreds and patches
                  of circumstances, yclept memory, he drew forth to mental vision the picture of a
                  fair-faced cousin, with golden ringlets and dove eyes, and in the background, like
                  a haunting shadow, flitted the boyhood of Arthur Walsingham.</p>
               <p>"What ever became of Viola?" he asked, abruptly</p>
               <p>Walsingham started as if some one had struck him, but answered, quietly,</p>
               <p>"She married."</p>
               <p>"And you got the property, and it ruined you?"</p>
               <p>Walsingham's face grew a shade paler, and a thought more serious, as he
                  answered—</p>
               <p>"It did, indeed."</p>
               <p>"I knew no good would come of it, when our queer old uncle conceived the idea of
                  uniting the remote branches of the family in you and Viola, and left his fortune
                  between you. He thought it a pretty plan; but, to my mind, families are better
                  separated than united. That is a morbid pride which delights in perpetuating
                  family failings. So, our pretty kinswoman grew weary of her boy lover, and
                  forfeited her share of the inheritance for a bearded spouse; while you, having
                  plenty of money, fold your talents in a napkin, and intend to doze away the
                  energies of early manhood at your ease. That's the story, is it?"</p>
               <p>"Not quite," said Walsingham, in his low, quiet voice. "You have omitted an
                  important feature. I loved her, and she broke my heart."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Pshaw!</emph>" said the Captain, with an emphasis which imparted to that
                  innocent expletive all the force of an oath. "You were but a boy, and she a woman,
                  you ninny!"</p>
               <p>"With all the enthusiasm of youth I loved her; and when she was lost to me, the
                  world held nothing worth a struggle."</p>
               <p>Withdrawing his feet from their mantel perch, the Captain took two or three rapid
                  turns across the room; then, pausing before his brother, exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"And is it because her paltry doll's face looks its nothings<pb n="22-23"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000012"/> in another man's home, that the sun cannot shine
                  upon yours? Is it because a boyish fancy was thwarted, that all the gifts of
                  nature and fortune are wasted? Oh, heavens! that a piece of clay like that should
                  mar the making of such a man!"</p>
               <p>"What do you mean?" exclaimed Walsingham.</p>
               <p>"I mean this," answered the Captain. "When we parted, you stood on the verge of
                  manhood, crowned with rare gifts, and full of promise. On my return, I looked to
                  find you filling a wide circle—honoured among men—eminent in some
                  way—distinguished for some thing—running a race with the world, and distancing
                  your competitors. How is it? You have lain idly by, while human tortoises have
                  toiled their way to distinctions, you might have reached with half the
                  effort."</p>
               <p>"They presented allurements to the tortoises, I suppose; to me they did not."</p>
               <p>"Look at your class-mates," continued the Captain, not heeding this reply; "Dick
                  Jones, who was for ever snivelling over Latin exercises, is a famous poet; Tom
                  Hawkins, whose problems were never solved, sits in the national councils; while
                  you, the genius of the class, sit sighing your life away, because a whimsical girl
                  did not take a fancy to your smooth chin."</p>
               <p>All this was not precisely pleasant to Walsingham, touching, as it did, the sorest
                  spot of a sensitive heart; but he answered, with quiet self-control,</p>
               <p>"You speak in a tone of reproach, Ben, as though I wronged you. Why should you
                  feel aggrieved because I consult my vagabond inclinations?"</p>
               <p>"No man has a right to be a vagabond, to whom God has given capacities for
                  something better! You <emph>do</emph> wrong me, when you rob me of my hopes in
                  you. You wrong the world, when you withhold the services which you are qualified
                  to render; and you wrong—"</p>
               <p>"Spare me the enumeration of my sins, dear Ben, and listen to me. Curb your wrath,
                  and bridle your rampant ambition. I do not quarrel with you, because you have not
                  taken a fleet, or reproach you, if you are not a commodore. If I possess great
                  gifts, as you say, in heaven's name love me for them, and not for any notoriety
                  they might achieve. Be proud of my merits, though no man save yourself perceives
                  them. Are we not alike foolish? I, because I hoped for happiness; you, because you
                  covet distinction? Nay, I am the wiser of the two; for, my bubble having burst, I
                  am not to be deluded into the pursuit of yours."</p>
               <p>"Well, it's your own business," said the Captain, taking his candle; "forgive me
                  for having meddled with it; and now, good-night."</p>
               <p>"Good-night!"</p>
               <p>"Hang it," muttered the Captain, as the door closed between them; "who would
                  suppose that after half a dozen years of separation, we should fall so naturally
                  into an old-fashioned, brotherly quarrel!"</p>
               <p>Walsingham returned to the library, and seating himself, with head upon his hand,
                  communed with the phantoms of the past, which this conversation had conjured from
                  their hiding-places. His own earnest, enthusiastic boyhood, as the<pb n="24-25"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000013"/> Captain had depicted it, full of hope and promise.
                  The "being beauteous," who played upon his heart as on a harp, awakening all its
                  deepest, wildest melodies. The St. Cecilia of his soul! Ah, how the glad music of
                  young life rang out, beneath her angelic touch, and rosy hours danced gayly to the
                  measure that told of hope and love; then, with one rude sweep, she shivered those
                  tremulous heartstrings, and left them silent and joyless for ever!</p>
               <p>He thought of her beautiful face, shading its light and love in some far off home
                  which he might never visit; of her beneficent hand, girding with blessings the
                  only man he had ever hated. He knew him not, but was he not the foul fiend who
                  stood between him and Paradise? He thought of her again, not with the garlands of
                  youth upon her brow, as he had last beheld her, but in the maturity of glorious
                  womanhood, <q>

                        <l rend="ti-1">"Begirt with growing infancy—</l>
                        <l>Daughters and sons of beauty!"</l>

               </p>
               <p>Wife—mother—children! all should have been his! Should have filled his yearning
                  heart and gladdened his desolate home.</p>
               <p>He drew his hand across his brow; the vision vanished, and the gloomy midnight
                  solitude oppressed him. Unlocking his escritoire he drew thence a packet of
                  letters (<emph>hers</emph>), and read them for companionship. Most ghostly
                  company! How the fond words mocked his disappointed heart! Here sat he, wronged,
                  forsaken, reading promises of unfailing truth and never-ending devotion, warm on
                  the page as when the fair hand first traced them.</p>
               <p>Then came the last, confessing that another had beguiled her heart, and bidding
                  him forget her.</p>
               <p>Forget her! Not a day in all his after life had he forgotten to pray for her,
                  though she had well nigh wrecked him!</p>
               <p>"This was the last," he said with a sigh, as, refolding it, he restored the packet
                  to its place and locked the escritoire. "This was the last."</p>
               <p>But it was not the last. One more was even now travelling to his hand, destined to
                  be a link uniting all that had passed with much that was to come.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
               <head type="sub">A LETTER.</head>
               <p>WALSINGHAM, whose nervous excitement banished sleep that night, fell, toward
                  morning, into an uneasy slumber; but the Captain was awake betimes, and ready to
                  reconnoitre. Dressing himself with alacrity, he sallied forth to spy out the
                  land.</p>
               <p>He remembered that the night before he had approached the house by a bridle road,
                  winding up the back of the hill, which sloped away to the south. He, therefore,
                  upon leaving the piazza, walked in an opposite direction. A few steps brought him
                  to the edge of the precipice, where a scene of wonderful beauty lay before him.
                  Far beneath, laving the base of the pile of rock on which he stood, swept the
                  Susquehanna. From low ridges of hills, rolling northward, the waters of the "North
                  River" came dancing in the morning light, and the two blended streams spread out a
                  mile in width toward the east. Uprose the sun from out this placid expanse of
                  waters, and, shaking the mists from his mane, touched with roseate glow meadow and
                  forest, plain and hill! Far up the valley of the North River, far up the valley of
                  the west, the heavy mists gathered in silvery wreaths, and trooped away, like
                  shadows of the night that had outstayed their time. Beneath his feet their white
                  wings fluttered, and he felt as one standing upon the clouds!</p>
               <p>"Jupiter!" ejaculated the Captain, "could Olympus itself afford a finer
                  look-out!"</p>
               <p>The father of gods and men, thus apostrophized, seemed to assure the Captain that
                  his conjecture was correct, for he nodded to himself as though his expressed
                  opinion was receiving occult, as well as ocular confirmation.</p>
               <p>The Captain was in the habit of taking great liberties with the gods of
                  heathendom, but he excused himself, saying he had been hand and glove with them at
                  college. It will be seen he was one of those impetuously energetic men, who find
                  ordinary language too weak for their strong necessities.</p>
               <p>Such men need expletives. Captain Ben had an uncomfortable horror of swearing
                  Christian oaths (as the honest fellow called them), having been early taught by a
                  pious mother, that "God will not hold him guiltless who taketh his name in vain."
                  But with all his habitual reverence, he wasted none upon the gods of heathenesse.
                  The pagan deities, he averred, were only fit to swear by.</p>
               <p>Captain Ben and his brother, as widely unlike as men with the same blood in their
                  veins could possibly be, had been subjected to the same home training, and the
                  same mental discipline. They had been carefully reared children, and<pb n="28-29"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000015"/> carefully educated youths, but nature asserted
                  herself paramount in each. They were stocks that might be pruned and trained, but
                  would, nevertheless, yield each its own peculiar fruit.</p>
               <p>The Captain's motto was that of Demosthenes—"Action—<emph>action</emph>—ACTION!"
                  but he used it in a more comprehensive sense than the olden orator ever dreamed
                  of. On leaving school he threw aside his books, and took to the sea as naturally
                  as a duckling to water. There was great consternation in the Walsingham family on
                  this occasion; they feared their care had been wasted upon this restless scion of
                  their quiet race. They extended, however, a helping hand, aiding the boy to rise
                  in the pursuit he had chosen, and found, in time, that although education had
                  failed to mould, it had greatly modified. The boisterous embracer of a rude
                  profession, combined in his character the elements of a Christian, a gentleman,
                  and a scholar, thanks to parents and professors. Pure in principle, honourable and
                  intelligent, a finer fellow never floated!</p>
               <p>If the Captain was active, Arthur was meditative. The one was an energetic
                  thinker; the other a decisive performer. They were both men of strong natures,
                  strong feelings, and strong passions, but the one had attained a quiet
                  self-mastery, where the other had grown violently demonstrative. Natural results
                  of their separate habits of thinking and acting.</p>
               <p>Had Arthur Walsingham been happy in his early attachment, he would have been
                  strong for the battle of life. Love and ambition with entwined hands would have
                  lifted him up to greatness; or had his love held him with a feebler thrall, the
                  allurements of the world would have consoled its disappointment. It was the power
                  of his unsatisfied passion that had prostrated him; and, although the fire had
                  mouldered to ashes long ago, leaving his bosom cold, no spark of ambition
                  rekindled or revivified the ruin. His energies were scathed. The world had denied
                  him that which his heart most coveted, happiness,—and he sought not the lesser
                  boon of distinction. Therefore was it that he turned to the seclusion and
                  companionship of nature— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l rend="ti-4">"That friend,</l>
                        <l>Who never did betray the heart that loved her."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> Her truths and mysteries peopled his solitude. Knowledge and science revealed
                  their secrets to him; and, in converse with high and hidden things, the wildly
                  yearning heart of the recluse grew calm. Of these serene teachers he learned
                  content.</p>
               <p>But the appearance of his brother, associated as he was with the eventful era of
                  his history—their conversation upon things which he had put far from him—the
                  letters—these exhumed the past. His buried hopes arose again to haunt him.</p>
               <p>"This is a fine country," said the Captain, as his glowing morning face confronted
                  his brother's pale one, at the breakfast table; "but a spell of silence broods
                  over it. I have not heard a sound save the breakfast bell. I would live upon
                     the<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC5981-00000016"/> seashore, where I could hear the
                  eternal roar of ocean. Do you know, I never hear the sea without fancying it
                  proclaiming in its ceaseless surge the words of that grand old psalm our mother
                  used to read,—"The sea is his, and he made it." But it is only when the old
                  monster meets his boundaries that he rages and roars. In his great deeps he is
                  silent.</p>
               <p>"By George, here comes a post-bag! I would as soon expect to meet one upon
                  Chimborazo!"</p>
               <p>The Captain now addressed himself to the muffins, while Walsingham sipped his
                  coffee, and looked languidly over his letters.</p>
               <p>Why did he suddenly start? Why did his pale face mantle with ruddy glow? Why did
                  his heart beat and his brain whirl?</p>
               <p>'Twas a small and delicately folded letter which he held, with a few faint
                  characters upon it. Were they traced in the same style as those over which he
                  mused last night, or was it fancy? He tore open the envelope and read—</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"I have been nerved, by great extremity, to write to you, who are the only
                     friend Providence has left me. I call you friend, because I feel that wherever
                     you are, and however you may be situated, you are such to me. If you have never
                     heard of me since my marriage, you may be interested to learn that he, who
                     tempted me to wrong you, became your avenger. Of his faults it becomes not me,
                     who have erred so widely, to speak—of his treatment it is not my intention to
                     complain. We were not happy together, and separated. In efforts to sustain
                     myself and child, health has failed, and I am dying.</p>
                  <p>"That fatal elopement estranged my kindred, as you know. My father died without
                     according me his forgiveness, and my brothers are cruel in their wrath. You,
                     who were most wronged, have been most forgiving. At your hands I have received
                     kindness, and to you I appeal. If ever I was aught to you, be a friend to my
                     poor child! I feel that I am presumptuous where I should be most humble, but
                     maternal agony is my excuse. Oh, Arthur, you too are, perhaps, a parent, and
                     can, in some degree, appreciate a mother's anxiety for her soon to be doubly
                     orphaned child. By all the love you bear your own little ones, I implore you be
                     a friend to mine! Let her enjoy the companionship of your children; let her
                     mind develop under your influence, and it may be that God will teach her to
                     compensate your care, and atone for the faults of her mother."</p>
               </q>
               <p>Another paragraph, containing her direction, and the simple signature of
                     <emph>Viola,</emph> concluded the letter.</p>
               <p>Walsingham was excessively shocked, but his accustomed self-mastery prevented the
                  betrayal of his emotions, or else the Captain, by a special interposition of hot
                  muffins, failed to perceive them. That jolly gentleman, having whetted his
                  appetite upon the morning air, devoted himself to the viands before him, with an
                  exclusiveness that forbade conversation, and afforded his brother an opportunity
                  of marshalling his tumultuous thoughts.</p>
               <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC5981-00000017"/>
               <p>Was it but last night he had pictured her loving and beloved? Beautiful and happy!
                  Could she really be desolate and dying—she who, to the eye of love, had seemed
                  immortal! And had she (there was a sad pleasure in the thought!) learned at last
                  the worth of the heart she had slighted—had she turned to him again when all the
                  world had failed her, and rested her burdens on him!</p>
               <p>He opened the letter and re-read it, lingering over the signature
                     <emph>Viola.</emph> Could that name stand sponsor for the humble heart-broken
                  words preceding it? It was not wont to follow in such a train! Yet it was
                  delicately traced, as it had been of yore to many a gay missive, and he pressed it
                  reverently, as once passionately, to his lips, and vowed he would not fail her in
                  her extremity.</p>
               <p>His heart already yearned toward the child—a little child! What a novel phenomenon
                  of humanity was this—what were its wants and habits, and how was he to minister to
                  them? He would receive this legacy of care, and, perhaps, of its necessities, the
                  child would be his teacher.</p>
               <p>As his thoughts grew calmer he concluded that it would be better to confide the
                  matter to the Captain, and consult him upon the course to be pursued to get
                  possession of his little ward. Just then, the Captain, having appeased the lion of
                  appetite, remarked—</p>
               <p>"You're a jolly fellow for a mess! When a brother comes to breakfast with you,
                  after six years' absence, one would think you would have something to say to
                  him."</p>
               <p>"I have a great deal to say to him, but first let him read this;" and he handed
                  him the letter.</p>
               <p>The Captain read to the end without comment (a remarkable piece of self-restraint;
                  for, with him, to think was to speak), and then struck his clenched hand violently
                  upon the table. This act afforded him some relief, and he sat with lips resolutely
                  closed, as though determined to say nothing which he might regret. Walsingham was
                  likewise silent, and the Captain at length broke forth with—</p>
               <p>"What do you mean to do?"</p>
               <p>"That is what I wish you to advise."</p>
               <p>"I advise! By Gog and Magog, I should tell her she has sown the wind, and may reap
                  the whirlwind! I would likewise send my best wishes for a plentiful harvest.
                  Appoint you her brat's nurse, indeed!" and the Captain discharged a volley of
                  heathen deities.</p>
               <p>"You would do no such thing, Ben Walsingham. You would be proud of me, if I
                  avenged my wrongs upon a dying woman and helpless child, would you not? Viola's
                  sufferings have expiated her offences, and were it otherwise, 'twould shame my
                  manhood to entertain wrath toward the woman I once regarded with tenderness. To
                  the appeal of this unhappy lady I shall promptly respond, and you will advise with
                  and aid me."</p>
               <p>The Captain was mollified, as he looked upon the earnest countenance of Viola's
                  generous advocate. His indignation gave a few expiring throes, as he mentally
                  exclaimed, "What a noble nature has this woman slighted!" He thought of her,<pb

                        <l>Richer than all his tribe."</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"God bless my mother's boy!" he cried, grasping Walsingham's hand.</p>
               <p>"I shall go to her immediately, Ben."</p>
               <p>"As I have no vocation for solitude, in the crow's nest, I'll e'en go with you,"
                  said the Captain, recovering from his emotion.</p>
               <p>"Wonder if we are to bring the baby back with us?" he added, laughing. "Oh,
                  Mahomet! what a nice nursery appendage I shall be! If it was a monkey from India,
                  now, or an elephant from Siam, I'd be just the man for the emergency. But a
                  miserable young human! The most stupidly helpless of all created things, don't ye
                  see?"</p>
               <p>Walsingham saw, but too plainly, the difficulties of the case in their most
                  magnified aspect, poor ignorant bachelor as he was; but hoped that as they
                  belonged to the same species, they should, by dint of sympathy, instinct, or
                  something better, be able to understand the requirements of their mighty charge.
                  Seeking Mrs. Grey, he briefly communicated to that important functionary that he
                  had been summoned to attend the death-bed of a friend, and would probably return
                  with a child, for the comfort of which he desired her to make suitable
                  provision.</p>
               <p>From the effect of this astounding announcement, that lady did not recover until
                  her master had made good his retreat, thereby escaping the volley of wonders and
                  queries that bubbled bled in delighted effervescence from her lips. "A child!
                  goodness me! a child in this house! That <emph>will</emph> be like folks! Wonder
                  if it's a boy or girl? Girl, I hope, like my poor little Petsy. How old did he
                  say? If it's a baby, I ought to know! Sister's child, I s'pose! No, he has nary
                  sister. Whose?" and here Mrs. Grey's tumultuous reflections went trooping pellmell
                  through the fog of conjecture.</p>

               <head type="sub">MRS. GREY.</head>
               <p>MRS. GREY, most courteous reader! She comes between us and the sunshine with
                  presence as genial. May her beneficent shadow amplify, for there is warmth in
                  it.</p>
               <p>The capacious heart in Mrs. Grey's capacious bosom throbbed with the kindliest
                  impulses of feminine humanity, sending a warm tide of love, and sympathy, circling
                  with the healthy life blood through her system. The good soul was ever chanting an
                  anthem, and its burden was (although she knew it not), "Good will toward men!" Ay,
                  and birds, and beasts, and fishes—in short, toward every created thing wherein
                  circulated the blood or sap of life.</p>
               <p>Loving all animated nature with her large honest heart, Mrs. Grey especially
                  enjoyed companionship with the same. At an earlier period her social qualities had
                  been fostered among men—good-natured, blustering, loquacious fellows, with lively
                  gossiping wives; she was a ready gossip herself then, and might be yet, if she
                  could find a listener. Very dreary had seemed the Eyrie to the good woman, when
                  first she led captive her social instincts to its appalling solitudes. But the
                  principle of life is omnipresent. Men immured in dungeons are not (thank God!)
                  alone! A loathsome spider in the cell of the unfortunate, may act an angel's part
                  in awakening his dormant sympathies. Touching friendships have subsisted between
                  mice and men through years of prison companionship. The germination of a stray
                  seed in the crevice of his prison pavement has given the yearning heart of the
                  captive an object of interest, sympathy, and delight. Man cannot shut his brother
                  out from the all pervading life of nature.</p>
               <p>In like manner, the social tendencies of Mrs. Grey sent forth instinctive tendrils
                  amid the abounding Eyrie life. They grasped at pigs and chickens; they reached
                  frantically after forest birds; and embraced, with tender convolutions, the dog
                  Cuff and the cat Chloe. These last-named worthies were confidential friends, to
                  whom she addressed various remarks, and occasionally consulted in household
                  emergencies, as an ancient Cummer might be supposed to consult her familiar. They
                  enjoyed, indeed, the reputation of uncanny beasts; and, as it was deemed by the
                  simple country folks unlucky to offend them, we will give them a passing
                  notice.</p>
               <p>Cuff was an estray terrier, who rejoiced in the personal advantages of a coal
                  black coat, great sulphurous eyes, and scarlet-lined jaws. No one knew from whence
                  he came. He appeared at the Eyrie, looked upon the land that it was pleasant,
                  curled himself upon the door mat, and invested himself<pb n="38-39"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000020"/> with the guardianship of the estate; announcing the
                  same in noisy proclamation to all after comers.</p>
               <p>Some months after his voluntary assumption of office, Monsieur Cuff returned from
                  chase in the forest, with a miserably terrified starveling kitten in his mouth,
                  which, to the horror of all observers, was so like himself as to suggest the idea
                  that these mysterious brutes wore the livery of an evil master. There was the same
                  ominously black coat, the same yellow, glaring eyes, the same fiery tongues. As
                  the cat lay panting on the floor, and the dog stood over his strange deposit, the
                  one yelped, and the other hissed and spat, with wide, red mouths, in such a
                  diabolical manner, that all who witnessed were ready to aver that flames issued
                  from those hot, cavernous jaws!</p>
               <p>An unnatural, and (as the ignorant believed) unholy friendship grew between these
                  children of Erebus, which filled the minds of their fellow servitors with
                  disquiet, and occasioned vacancies in the household which Walsingham found
                  difficult to fill.</p>
               <p>It was about this time that John Grey died, and his excellent helpmate, deprived
                  of her little home, was forced to earn her bitter bread under the roof of another.
                  Very painful to this veteran housekeeper was the prospect of subordinacy. Those
                  dear domestic tactics known among the craft as "<emph>my ways,</emph>" to be
                  subjugated by the unworthy <emph>ways</emph> of a mistress! Forbid it, Fate! She
                  would suffer martyrdom for her culinary faith, and spoil pickles and confections
                  to please no one. This spirit naturally interfered with the domestic peace of Mrs.
                  Tonks, to whom Grey had reluctantly proffered her assistance in household
                  mysteries; and a series of spirited engagements took place, in which Mrs. Tonks
                  hoped, in round, Dutch accents, that she might have her own way in her own house;
                  and Mrs. Grey proclaimed her determination to "spile good vittles to please
                  nobody."</p>
               <p>While these two ladies were battling for their respective culinary creeds,
                  Walsingham became conscious of great discomfort in his domicil. He actually went
                  supperless to bed one night, with the prospect of breaking his fast upon the roots
                  and herbs of his hermitage in the morning, the inmates of his kitchen having one
                  by one deserted. The last fugitive, as she took her winding way down the mountain,
                  paused to rest at Mrs. Tonks's, and described the state of affairs at the
                  Eyrie:—"It was all along of them bewitched black beasts," she said.</p>
               <p>"I never tid like black; 'tis only fit for a witch's pettermost!" remarked Dame
                  Tonks, glancing spitefully at Grey's mourning garb.</p>
               <p>"You left without a word of warning?" inquired that injured lady, not observing
                  the offensive remark, in her interest for the deserted Walsingham.</p>
               <p>He was such a solemn, gravestone sort o' man, was Walsingham, she was always
                  afraid to say <emph>boo!</emph> to him, and had, consequently, dispensed with the
                  distasteful ceremony.</p>
               <p>"Why, you ought to be ashamed to leave the poor gentleman so!" remonstrated
                  Grey.</p>
               <p>"Ant vy den?" cut in the heavy Dutch tongue of the mistress<pb n="40-41"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000021"/> tress of the mansion. "To pig man, and to leetle
                  togge, all both pelong to te same Ault Nick, and little lass petter run away ash
                  stay!"</p>
               <p>"Nick or no, she might have given warning," contended Grey, whose youth having
                  been passed at service, had her principles.</p>
               <p>"Vat nonshense! ven beoples vant to go, dey petter go."</p>
               <p>"I want to go," said Grey.</p>
               <p>"Vat's to hinder? dis little lass will take your ped, to your vork, and we'll have
                     <emph>peas</emph> in te house. Valk out!" and Mrs. Tonks set wide the kitchen
                  door.</p>
               <p>The good <foreign xml:lang="DUT">vrow</foreign> was obliged to postpone the
                  enjoyment of <emph>peas</emph> until morning, as Mrs. Grey declined venturing
                  forth into the darkness and solitude of the mountain.</p>
               <p>And in the early morning, when Walsingham carried his dignity and scholarship into
                  the kitchen, in search of a crust of bread, or a glass of milk, whereon to break
                  his fast, he was appalled by the barrenness of that hitherto unexplored
                  region.</p>
               <p>He had supposed that kitchens spontaneously flowed with milk and honey; but when
                  he got there the cupboard was bare, and so the poor dog (of a bachelor) got
                  none!</p>
               <p>There was a pan of milk, to be sure, but when he dipped his glass in it, the
                  supposed liquid proved a solid, and broke in thick, jelly-like masses, that made
                  him sick; and turning his back upon it, he walked forth upon the lawn.</p>
               <p>A rosy-cheeked, respectable-looking woman in black approached, and saluted
                  him—</p>
               <p>"Good-morning, sir. Would you like to have a housekeeper?"</p>
               <p>"I would, of all things," responded the hungry bachelor, smiling at the
                  comfortable suggestion.</p>
               <p>"My name is Jenny Grey, widow of John Grey, as was drownded. You knew John,
                  sir?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Walsingham had known, employed, and trusted the departed John, and was only
                  too happy to know, employ, and trust his bereaved mate.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Grey was forthwith installed in the duties of her office; and, hanging her
                  black bonnet and shawl upon a peg, proceeded to devise a breakfast, with none to
                  molest or make her afraid.</p>
               <p>After sufficient time had elapsed, as he thought, for her to survey the premises,
                  Walsingham sought this household queen, blushing boyishly, as he remembered the
                  barrenness of her newly acquired domain.</p>
               <p>"There seems to be nothing here, Mrs. Grey. I would like you to visit town and lay
                  in a supply of such things as are requisite for a good housekeeper," and he smiled
                  as he tendered his purse.</p>
               <p>"There would be time enough for that," she said, cheerily, and in the mean time
                  she would give him his breakfast. The coffee and omelette were ready, and she
                  would bake the flannel cakes at once.</p>
               <p>Breakfast? Why, the woman had hardly been in the house long enough to find the
                  spoons, and here was the table neatly<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC5981-00000022"/>
                  laid! Coffee! omelette! flannel cakes! where on earth <emph>did</emph> she get
                  them? The poor, ignorant, helpless fellow had seen none of these things in the
                  pantry, and while speculating upon the probable connexion between flannel cakes
                  and petticoats, the breakfast bell rang.</p>

               <p>A SICK-ROOM! You pause upon the threshold, fair lady, for sick-rooms are sad to
                  youth and beauty. But youth and beauty, love and hope, must sometimes enter the
                  chamber of suffering, and are ofttimes prisoners there. The mother's cheerful room
                  will one day be darkened—the noisy, joyous nursery, perchance, become silent and
                  sad, or your own luxurious boudoir, where you are dreaming bright dreams of Love
                  to-day, may be entered by a sterner archer!</p>
               <p>Be not thus startled, lady, but give a thought to that inevitable meeting with the
                  last enemy of thy race, that when the Inexorable comes to claim his own, thou
                  mayest arise, and meet him with a courageous heart. He is not always feared!<pb
                     n="44-45" xml:id="VAC5981-00000023"/> He is not always terrible! Oh, there is
                  sometimes that in life which surpasses the bitterness of death! Come with me, and
                  see Heaven's usher perform his mission.</p>
               <p>In a dimly lighted room, a lady, pale and wasted, is stretched upon her couch.
                  Nestling among the pillows, by her side, with her flushed cheek pressed to that of
                  the dying one, is a little child. By the bedside stands Walsingham, holding the
                  hand, and looking, with chastened thought, into the face of the only woman he has
                  ever loved. Behind him, the Captain, serious and still.</p>
               <p>These are not all. There are more, although we see them not! Heaven's angels are
                  there ministering—seraphic faces bend around in love ineffable—the dim room
                  brightens with their halo, and their mysterious influences enfold these mortal
                  hearts!</p>
               <p>Believest thou this?</p>
               <p>And one other is there! A pale, stern shadow broods above that head, with upraised
                  hand which falters not. Deal gently with her, thou Deliverer!</p>
               <p>She opens her eyes, and murmurs, with a look of inquiry,</p>
               <p>"Viola?"</p>
               <p>"Mamma!" responds the nestler, with a kiss.</p>
               <p>"You will be kind to her!—will care for her—Walsingham?"</p>
               <p>"So gladly!" he answers in a tone of assurance. He would fain say more, but dares
                  not trust himself to speak. It is as well; for the mother understands that she may
                  repose this dear trust in him. With anxious love she continues—</p>
               <p>"Let her not be an alien in your house, for she has been nurtured in love. Let her
                  be a sister to your own little ones,—and—and—oh, Walsingham! will the wife of your
                  bosom be a mother to my child?"</p>
               <p>She fixes her large dark eyes upon him with a look of anxious inquiry.</p>
               <p>"Viola," he answers, "my home is wifeless—childless. The vow which binds me to
                  your little one is the only one I shall ever register."</p>
               <p>A look of pained surprise—a moan of self-reproach, tells him she has learned at
                  last the worth of the heart she wrecked.</p>
               <p>But that is past—other thoughts disturb the pillow of the dying.</p>
               <p>"Tell <emph>him</emph>—my husband—you may meet one day—that I forgive as I would
                  be forgiven. I do not say he wronged me—<emph>I</emph>—who am so much in the wrong
                  myself. Right and wrong are so confused—so intermingled—I can't unravel it now—it
                  will soon be clearer!"</p>
               <p>They wave their shining wings around to dissipate the glooms that have gathered so
                  darkly; but she sees not those bright companions of her dawning future, waiting
                  with serene expectancy the soul's birth into eternity. She sees them not, for the
                  flesh is still strong!</p>
               <p>"Tell him to deal wisely with our boy, of whom we were both so proud. Oh, my first
                  born! you are not here to receive my blessing. How can I die and leave him in the
                  wide, wicked world!"</p>
               <p>"Though earth is wide, heaven is above all," says the<pb n="46-47"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000024"/> deep voice of the Captain. And the celestial band
                  look in each other's eyes and smile with glad intelligence, for they know that "HE
                  shall give his angels charge concerning" him.</p>
               <p>Poor anguished spirit, the seraphs sing to thee, and their theme is, rest—peace!
                     <emph>rest—peace!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>The influence of their spirit voices pervades her heart, albeit unheard by the ear
                  of flesh, and she smiles, as she utters,</p>
               <p>"<emph>Rest!—Peace!</emph>"</p>
               <p>Then an angel shouts, with triumphant voice, "<emph>Heaven!</emph>" but the soul,
                  halting on heaven's verge, comprehends not the lofty music. Earthly voices drown
                  the strain.</p>
               <p>"Mamma!—mamma!—look at me—speak to me!—I am afraid!"</p>
               <p>"You have called me back, darling!—I am not afraid; why should you be? Who says
                  that Death is cruel?"</p>
               <p>"Death is cruel! Death is cruel!" murmured the shuddering child, her vague terrors
                  taking shape from her mother's words. And still the cold shadow broods, unmoved by
                  the wail of sorrow.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>Death is cruel!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Peace, maligner!</p>
               <p>Softly, at the appointed time, he breathes upon the burning brow, and it grows
                  cool. He lays a restraining hand on the tumultuous heart, and it is still.</p>
               <p>And as those earthly faces fade from the failing vision, the seraph host brightens
                  around the bed. In exultant gladness the disenthralled spirit joins that glorious
                  company, and flits forth into the vastness of eternity. And still in that death
                  chamber rings the distracted cry,</p>
               <p>"Death is cruel! <emph>Death is cruel!</emph>"</p>
               <p>Ah, yes! it is to the bereaved, the darkened, the blind, the circumscribed that
                  death is cruel! To those for whom he refuses to lift the veil; and not to the
                  favoured, who, by the power of his arm, are launched into the <emph>illimitable
                     bliss</emph> of <emph>eternal being!</emph>

               <p>VERY heavily did time hang on the hands of social Grey, after the departure of her
                  master. She was fruitful in resources, however, and devised a pretty little
                  house-cleaning divertisement, the charming excitement of which beguiled the tedium
                  of her solitude. The lumber-room was transformed into a nursery for the expected
                  child; a vision of which, in white long-clothes, hovered perpetually about the
                  good lady's head. The student's library was so thoroughly "put to rights," that he
                  did not find his favourite authors for a twelvemonth after. A brewing of currant
                  wine was concocted for the delectation of supposititious guests. Mrs. Grey made it
                  yearly; it was growing old in the cellar, all the better for keeping, and was sure
                  to be used some day. A few jellies and jams were compounded; after which the
                  industrious dame, having exhausted her active amusements, was fain to take her
                  sewing, summon her council, and proceed to stitch and chat.</p>
               <p>This council, or, more properly speaking, kitchen cabinet, composed of Premier
                  Cuff, and his coadjutor Chloe, was regarded by Mrs. Grey with a vague gratitude.
                  She felt that by their occult practices she had been provided with a peaceful,
                  albeit lonely (she could not forget that it was lonely) home; and as became the
                  recipient of so great a benefit, she was mindful of the comfort of her swarthy
                  friends.</p>
               <p>Spreading a mat at her feet, upon which they curled themselves in amity, the good
                  woman arranged her sewing. From this she frequently looked up to apostrophize her
                  companions; for what was companionship without conversation?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Grey had found her humble friends the best of listeners, and was in the habit
                  of confiding to them her arrangements, opinions, and conjectures; and, to their
                  honour be it said, they never had betrayed her confidence, which, in all
                  probability, they would have done had they been human.</p>
               <p>They were consulted with profit too in doubtful cases, as for instance:—</p>
               <p>"Pussy, I've lost my gusset; I always do lose gussets; they are so little;
                     and—<emph>Did</emph> you see my gusset, Chloe?"</p>
               <p>Chloe mewed, showing her scarlet jaws, and with diabolical prescience rubbed aside
                  her mistress's dress, revealing the lost gusset.</p>
               <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC5981-00000026"/>
               <p>"Bless the cat! She knows more than most humans, don't she, Cuff?"</p>
               <p>Cuff opened one sulphurous eye, and closed it again with a wink, which might be
                  interpreted to mean, "We know what we know."</p>
               <p>Standing on the table beside the eccentric needlewoman, was a friend more valued
                  than Cuff, more sagacious than Chloe, more companionable than either. It was the
                  kitchen clock, so called because Mrs. Grey found it on a shelf in the kitchen when
                  she arrived; but since her advent, it had become a most ubiquitous piece of
                  mechanism. Wherever was Mrs. Grey, there was the clock. If in the kitchen, it
                  stood on its accustomed shelf; if in the dining-room, on a little table beside her
                  work-basket; and if in her room, on the mantel opposite the good woman's bed. The
                  poor little clock was carried up to bed every night; and during the day might
                  frequently be seen in its transit from one spot to another.</p>
               <p>"It's awful lonesome without you," said Mrs. Grey.</p>
               <p>The clock was not only a good listener, but made valuable suggestions of its own;
                  such as, "the ham has boiled long enough;" or, "you had better be seeing about
                  dinner;" or again, "one mortal hour you have wasted." It was an oracle consulted
                  hourly; a regulator who directed every move within the mansion; a companion ever
                  present, ever prompt, ever true. Soulless and senseless, but more perfect, more
                  infallible perhaps, because devoid of soul and sense. A wonderful emanation of the
                  finite mind; a creation of the human hand, vigilant in the service of its maker; a
                  spy upon fugitive time, and a faithful reporter of his crafty theft of minutes
                  from the unwary.</p>
               <p>"Click, click, click," it whispered (other clocks say "tick," but this sharp
                  little thing said "<emph>click,</emph>" like a steel-trap). "Click, click, click,
                  there they go—one by one!—seconds, minutes, how they run!—click, click, the day is
                  done, and the night has just begun! Days like minutes rapid run, nights are
                  passing one by one; time itself will soon be done. Boom, boom, boom, boom! boom!
                  boom!" and with a succession of reports like the explosion of a six-barrelled
                  revolver, this faithful sentinel announced that another hour had passed for ever
                  down the rapids of time.</p>
               <p>"Six o'clock, is it? I suppose I must put by my sewing, and see about tea. Mr.
                  Walsingham will be here in less than an hour, eh?"</p>
               <p>"Click, click," answered the little clock with a loud, busy, bustling voice. That
                  clock was always in a hurry, remembering that time was ever on the wing, and might
                  possibly get the start of her.</p>
               <p>Placing her work-basket on its accustomed stand, Mrs. Grey tucked the clock under
                  her arm, and proceeded to the kitchen, feeling that, on the whole, she had had a
                  tolerably lively afternoon.</p>
               <p>"Come, Cuff," said she, as she placed the clock on its shelf, and picked up the
                  water-bucket; "you and I must go to the spring for water to fill the kettle. Don't
                  you think the path is steeper than it used to be, my old fellow? But you're a
                  sure-footed beast, and I am not. Not a beast? <emph>no,</emph> not sure-footed<pb
                     n="52-53" xml:id="VAC5981-00000027"/> footed;—<emph>yes,</emph> not a beast,
                  too! You yelp so I don't know what I'm saying. Bless you, Cuffee, how low the
                  spring is! I hope it won't go dry," etc., etc., ad infinitum.</p>
               <p>Trotting along by his mistress's side, Cuff vouchsafed not to reply. It would have
                  been a work of supererogation if he had, Mrs. Grey being more interested in the
                  expression of her own views than in receiving those of other people. Conversation
                  with her was rather a one-sided affair.</p>
               <p>She observed, however, on entering the kitchen, that the clock, with warning
                  finger, pointed to five minutes spent in the spring excursion.</p>
               <p>"To be sure I've dallied," said she, nodding good-naturedly in the face of her
                  monitor; "but I'll fly round, and make it up. Come, and skim the milk, puss,
                  puss;" and down the cellar-stairs she hastened, skimmer in hand, followed by
                  grimalkin, who mewed villanously during the skimming process, and refused to
                  receive her mistress's communications until conciliated by her usual saucer of
                  milk.</p>
               <p>Talking to the cat, the dog, the clock herself, and, if the proverb be true, the
                  Evil One, the loquacious dame proceeded briskly with her preparations for tea—her
                  lively colloquies (can these one-sided affairs be called such?) never retarding
                  her movements, but rather accelerating them. The faster she talked the faster she
                  moved, as men march in time to music; and never were her movements so inefficient
                  and spiritless as when performed in silence.</p>
               <p>"It's almost time they were here," said Mrs. Grey, looking in the face of her
                  friend.</p>
               <p>"Fifteen minutes of seven," replied the clock.</p>
               <p>"I wish they would come before you strike," observed she.</p>
               <p>"Click, click," continued the rapid little clock, as if she would say, "They had
                  better hurry—<foreign xml:lang="LAT">tempus fugit.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>But as she was about to raise her usual nue and cry after the vanished hour, the
                  sound of wheels attracted Grey and her coadjutors to the door.</p>

               <p>A STRANGE event in the home of Arthur Walsingham was the advent of a little child.
                  Mrs. Grey (fortunately for her master) was enraptured, as before hinted; for "the
                  place was a dreadful out-of-the-way place, and a child was such company." The
                  approbation of that important functionary secured, all minor embarrassments melted
                  from the new guardian's path, by virtue of certain abstruse practices known only
                  to housekeepers.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Grey's baton of office was a magic wand; she touched the lumber-room, and,
                  presto, behold! an airy, well-appointed chamber for the little guest. She waved it
                  over the bachelor's board, and uprose beside the tea and toast, or roast and
                  broil, dainty diet adapted to the taste of a child. What paps would she not
                  compound! what achievements of custards were hers! what a wonderfully endowed
                  woman was Mrs. Grey!</p>
               <p>The child was very beautiful; like, yet unlike her mother. A spiritual face,
                  lighted by large mystic eyes and shaded by clustering curls of gold. She seemed
                  shy, stunned, and bewildered, and looked with piteous eagerness in the direction
                  of opening doors or approaching footsteps, as though she expected the appearance
                  of the mother for ever lost. Walsingham was surprised that she did not ask for
                  her. He did not know that an uneasy remembrance of a pale passionless face in its
                  last repose, strangely unheedful of her childish agony, awed the inquiry that
                  trembled on her lips. This, in time, gave place to happier memories; and the
                  child, but faintly comprehending her bereavement, thought of her mother, not with
                  grief and tears, but with infinite love and vague yearning. The mother was so
                  interwoven with every hour of her young life's experiences, and so linked with all
                  her infantile knowledge, that to <emph>remember</emph> at all, was to think of
                     <emph>her.</emph> Mamma lived in all mamma had taught: through her precepts,
                  she, like a living presence, pervaded the heart of her child.</p>
               <p>The child was a reflective and imaginative little creature, whose active mind had
                  reached up to companionship with maturity. Walsingham fancied that her mother had
                  talked much with her, and it became a pleasure to him to listen to her prattle. He
                  traced her mother's influence in all she said, and sometimes felt as though
                     <emph>she</emph> spoke to him from the past through this novel medium.
                  Unaccustomed as he was to<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC5981-00000029"/> children, this
                  one was to him a new and beautiful revelation of life. Her fair transparent face
                  was like the face of an angel in his home; and he never contemplated its spiritual
                  loveliness without holy thoughts. He would take her in his arms, and be reminded
                  of that favoured child whom Jesus blessed. "Truly," he would think, in the
                  language of the benediction, "of such is the kingdom of Heaven." He would listen
                  to her prattle, abounding in quaint unconscious wisdom, and recall the inspiration
                  of Samuel's childhood. Her gentle attributes won on his sterner and
                  self-sufficient nature, until the affections which had so long run to waste were
                  gathered up and garnered in her.</p>
               <p>One night, soon after he had brought this new-found treasure home, before retiring
                  to rest he stepped into her little room, which adjoined his own, to look at the
                  sleeping child.</p>
               <p>Sleeping he had supposed her to be; but, when he bent over her, he was startled by
                  the large lustrous eyes that looked wonderingly into his own.</p>
               <p>"What, my little one," he said, smiling, "are you awake yet?"</p>
               <p>"It is not dark enough to sleep," she answered, pointing to a long path of
                  moonlight streaming across the floor. He immediately dropped the window blind, and
                  shut out the nocturnal brightness.</p>
               <p>"Please don't!" plead the little voice.</p>
               <p>"Why not? You can't sleep when the room is so light."</p>
               <p>"But I don't want to sleep—I don't want the light shut out—it is my own
                  light."</p>
               <p>"Oh, ho! private property, is it?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," the little maiden answered, with a simple dignity that seemed in a
                  manner to rebuke his levity, and doubts too, if he entertained any.</p>
               <p>"And how is it yours?" he inquired, curious to learn what lien she would file upon
                  moonlight.</p>
               <p>She hesitated; but as he sat down by her bed, and taking her tiny hand in his own,
                  caressed the pink curling fingers (a wonderful little piece of mechanism it was,
                  he thought, and beautiful beyond compare), she grew confidential.</p>
               <p>"Why," she began, in childish narrative, "you know I never slept alone until I
                  came here, and—"</p>
               <p>"True," interrupted the guardian, "I never thought of that."</p>
               <p>"And in the dark I was afraid; and so one night when I said my prayers (mamma
                  taught me my prayers), I asked God to let there be light."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Let there be light,</emph>" repeated Walsingham, struck by the sublime
                  expression of Holy Writ adapted to her little story.</p>
               <p>"Yes, the Bible says that, and prayers must be like the Bible you know."</p>
               <p>"Well?"</p>
               <p>"Well, then, as I lay in bed, this beautiful light came creeping, creeping, along
                  the carpet, and every night it lies upon the floor, and watches me, and I watch
                  it, and I do not like to go to sleep, for then it will be gone when I waken."</p>
               <p>"And you think it is sent to you especially?"</p>
               <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC5981-00000030"/>
               <p>"Yes, sir; because I said my prayers, and God heard them," she answered with
                  simple faith.</p>
               <p>"What do you think it is?" he inquired, willing to hear a further exposition of
                  her sweet belief.</p>
               <p>"I don't know," she said, somewhat puzzled; and then with a bright glad look,
                  expressive of a sudden revelation, added, "I think it is my guardian angel, don't
                  you? Mamma told me about guardian angels, they watch by our beds, and take care of
                  us, and all the while we don't see them."</p>
               <p>"This, you <emph>do</emph> see," suggested he.</p>
               <p>"Then it is not my guardian angel," the child replied, in a tone of
                  disappointment. "I wonder if it is an 'an angel of light?'"</p>
               <p>"My little Mystic is familiar with the whole hierarchy, I believe," said
                  Walsingham; and, taking her in his arms, he bore her to the window, and bade her
                  look abroad.</p>
               <p>"Your 'angel of light' is not only by your little bed tonight, my sweet one. His
                  white wings encompass the heavens, and his broad benediction covers the
                  earth."</p>
               <p>The young votary nestled in his arms, and looked abroad in smiling silence.
                  Children often enjoy most when least demonstrative.</p>
               <p>"What do you see?" he asked.</p>
               <p>He longed to hear her resume her prattle, and was also curious to know what
                  feature in all the moonlit beauty of earth and heaven would most engage the
                  attention of the child.</p>
               <p>"I see a little star, following the moon, just as I loved to follow mamma. I
                  wonder if the stars are the moon's little children?"</p>
               <p>This reminded him of a poet's conceit, and he repeated— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"The young moon, like a Roman mother,</l>
                        <l>'Mid her living jewels shone."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Then the moon <emph>is</emph> their mother!" exclaimed the child, who needed no
                  better authority than a poet's verse.</p>
               <p>"Now let me lay you in your bed, sweet child."</p>
               <p>"Not till I bid the little star good-night! I can do it in poetry—such beautiful
                  poetry! Listen:— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Good-night, little star, I will go to my bed,</l>
                        <l>And leave you to burn, while I lay down my head</l>
                        <l>On my pillow to rest, till the morning light;</l>
                        <l>Then you shall be fading, and I shall be bright."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> There! mamma taught me that—but it is not a prayer;" and with an impulse of
                  love she threw her arms about him, pressed a warmer and sweeter good-night upon
                  his lips, and sprang lightly into her bed.</p>
               <p>The fascinated student adjusted the counterpane with awkward tenderness, and held
                  one hand in his, while he beguiled her mind from the themes which had excited it.
                  Soothed by his presence, the little lids drooped softly, the dimpled hand relaxed
                  its clasp, and the young spirit wandered in spirit-land, enjoying those glimpses
                  of Heaven which bless our sleep in dreams.</p>
               <p>And as the child slumbered, the man sat in meditation by her pillow. He remembered
                  his own carefully-nurtured childhood<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC5981-00000031"/>
                  hood; the teachings of his matchless mother; the love which had trained and guided
                  him, and made him something better than he now was. Then he thought of the
                  light-laughing Viola, triumphant in girlish beauty, transformed into a patient,
                  pious mother like his own, by the wondrous power of maternal love. He pictured her
                  alternately teaching and caressing her treasure, and by a few soft graceful
                  touches making her impress upon the young spirit ere she went hence for ever. Then
                  his mind came back to the little one.</p>
               <p>He thought of the great loss sustained by the sleeping child. He thought also of
                  her delicate organization, her poetic temperament, and her beautiful though
                  startling speculations upon the invisible world. He thought with reverence of that
                  realizing faith whereby the vague and scant revealings of the unseen were
                  transformed into large and perfect realities in the heart of the undoubting child.
                  He almost felt that to this unsullted nature God had vouchsafed revealings
                  withheld from the world-hardened and world-encompassed, and the lisping infant
                  seemed half endowed with a prophet's dignity.</p>
               <p>With these reflections came the unpleasant suspicion that in the training of this
                  peculiarly gifted child he should require something more than the aid of the
                  hitherto all-sufficient Mrs. Grey. Grey was unequalled in her province of
                  providing for the wants of the creature, but who was to minister to the cravings
                  of this spiritual nature?</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">EYRIE LIFE.</head>
               <p>IF Walsingham in his self-sufficiency supposed that a fussy housekeeper, a
                  rollicking sailor, and a misanthropic student composed the domestic circle at the
                  Eyrie, he was about to receive enlightenment. With the nice discrimination of
                  childhood Viola found more congenial companionship in Mrs. Grey's large and
                  interesting circle of domestic animals, with whom she soon established a friendly
                  pact. The guardian laid aside his books to learn that his solitude was extremely
                  populous; that pigs, chickens, and the like have an individuality of their own;
                  that childhood possesses a spirit of adaptation and buoyancy of being which it
                  were wisdom to emulate; that Viola's death left not one stricken and faithful
                  mourner such as had bewailed her falsehood; with various scraps of valuable
                  knowledge such as we all arrive at, by one process or another, in our journey
                  through life. Here was the orphan child of Viola, forgetting her great loss, and
                  fixing her detached affections upon the fowls of the air and the beasts of the
                  field. When his love was lost to him, he had<pb n="62-63"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000032"/> stifled his kindliest sympathies, and ignored the
                  minor interests of life; he felt, as he observed the happy child, that he had not
                  done well to refuse the humble substitutes which nature offers her disappointed or
                  bereaved children.</p>
               <p>Viola had quite supplanted Mrs. Grey in the affections of her dumb friends. She
                  and the cat Chloe were on most confidential terms, and kept up a mysterious
                  whispering and purring in corners, while a matronly hen, rearing a tender brood of
                  young, regarded her with such distinguished favour as to suffer her invasion of
                  the sacred social circle without remonstrance. When <emph>Madame</emph> cried
                  cluck, the fluttering wee biddies and toddling child emerged from their respective
                  nooks, and hastened to the rendezvous, eager to learn the cause of the maternal
                  summons. So far from resenting the intrusion of the diminutive lady, the amiable
                  dame received her as one of the family, and she was welcome to share their
                  pickings if she chose. Two mocking birds were building a nest in the apple tree,
                  not so much for their own convenience as the child's entertainment, Walsingham
                  thought. With gliding, serpentine movement, they flitted eternally through the
                  shrubbery, chattering, twittering, singing in mad mimicry of all woodland voices,
                  and carrying their wild buffoonery to the extravagant excess of mewing like the
                  dignified Chloe herself.</p>
               <p>The dove cote contained a busy company, whose proceedings were watched from afar
                  with interest. There was the elegant and graceful Widow White, who, bereaved of
                  her beloved mate, sat apart pluming her pure bosom into the most dazzling
                  whiteness, and arching her snowy neck in the sunshine, with melancholy coo the
                  while, which seemed heralding her sorrows to nature's drowsy ear.</p>
               <p>There was Bully Bluster (the Captain was his sponsor!), a portly, middle-aged
                  bird, of choleric temper, who seemed a personage of weight and authority in the
                  feathered community. This individual, prompt to perceive and resent the most
                  accidental infringement of his smallest right (though what right any other fellow
                  had to flutter a pigeon's wing he could not understand), was generally in the
                  indignant mood. What with driving vagabond loiterers from his doorstep, chastising
                  insolent coxcombs who fluttered about Fanny, and keeping a sharp lookout for
                  offenders generally, he was usually in dudgeon. It was positively awful to see
                  him, under a sense of his injuries, rushing rapidly to and fro on his paddle, or
                  whirling round and about in fierce excitement, his body swelling, plumage
                  ruffling, and red eye glaring, while a wrathful growl of malediction consigned the
                  whole feathered fraternity to pot—pie: on such occasions he seemed an epitome of a
                  bull-dog tarred and feathered. Uninfluenced by the example of constancy set him by
                  Widow White on the next paddle, and undaunted by a trick which Walsingham had of
                  break-fasting on his tender mates, the crested hero had selected a third mate, one
                  Fanny Fantail, much younger than himself. A January and May sort of affair their
                  union was. Those who picture the young thing, immured in the nest of a crusty old
                  curmudgeon and pining under domestic tyranny, misconstrue the character of Bully
                  Bluster. A more kind, coddling, fussy old fool of a husband never waited upon the
                  whims of a wife.<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC5981-00000033"/> She was the safety-valve
                  through which he relieved himself of the compressed tenderness of his nature; and
                  although he habitually squared himself in boxing attitude against all creation, it
                  was his sovereign pleasure to be henpecked by Fanny. Has he not his parallel in
                  human kind?</p>
               <p>Fanny was usually in the straw, and he with bustling important air was hurrying to
                  and fro, hither and thither, eyeing with an imposing air of connoisseurship, and
                  selecting, or rejecting, bits of hay to tuck about her feet, or dainty crumbs for
                  her regalement. Had she felt that she could relish a grain of rice, he would have
                  flown to the fields of Georgia to pack his crop.</p>
               <p>Numerous lesser characters flitted across the scene; enamoured birds "with
                  livelier iris changing on their burnished breasts," pursuing some flying Daphne
                  through the forest; or tender mothers conducting their debutant brood through the
                  dizzy perils of first flight, kept up the busy interest of the scene. Although the
                  little spectator could not fully understand these various manœuvres, the tedium of
                  hours was beguiled in watching and wondering what it all could mean. Thus, in the
                  unmolested contemplation of the ever varying kaleidoscope of nature, was she
                  amused, beguiled—perhaps taught.</p>
               <p>Now, one day when Mrs. Grey, accompanied by the little Viola, had transacted
                  certain mysterious business in the village, she called at the house of Mrs. Irving
                  (the daughter of a former mistress) to refresh herself with the latest fashionable
                  intelligence current in kitchen circles, and in turn enter tain her friends with
                  the wonderful story of Viola's advent at the Eyrie, of which it appeared in some
                  inexplicable way Mrs. Grey herself was the heroine.</p>
               <p>While she discoursed with the demoiselles of the household, her young charge grew
                  very sociable with the little Irvings in the garden: enjoying, poor lonely thing,
                  such a game of romps as she had never dreamed of before.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Mrs. Grey, not yet! I do not want to go home yet!" she cried, when that lady
                  came in search of her.</p>
               <p>"Don't want to go home, and it so late! That's always the way with children,"
                  pettishly exclaimed Mrs. Grey, who had herself chatted in the kitchen beyond the
                  proper hour for leaving. "Come, come—and be quick, child."</p>
               <p>"It is not very late, for the sun has not gone down into the river, and the
                  fireflies are not yet out. Let me play a little longer—do, Mrs. Grey."</p>
               <p>"Can she not stay with the children to-night, Hannah?" interposed Mrs. Irving, who
                  sat with her needlework in an arbour. She had already heard the history of the
                  little guest, and had been charmed with the manner and appearance of the child.
                  "She can sleep with Helen, and I will drive with her to the Eyrie in the
                  morning."</p>
               <p>"You sweet darling," exclaimed Viola, to Helen, in childish ecstasy, "how I would
                  love to stay with you to-night!" She lowered her voice as she added, "I think it
                  is dreadful to be alone in the cold, dark night—don't you?"</p>
               <p>Helen laughed and said she could not tell; that it was always warm and bright, and
                  full of children, in their nursery.</p>
               <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC5981-00000034"/>
               <p>"How charming that must be!" cried Viola. "Mrs. Grey, shall I stay?"</p>
               <p>"Look! the sun has gone down now," said the duenna, "and it will soon be dark.
                  Then Mr. Walsingham will sit alone by the study window, and wonder why his little
                  girl does not climb on his knee, and sing songs to him in the twilight. That's the
                  way she does, ma'am," continued Grey, in an aside, dropping the style of
                  expression, which she considered appropriate to Viola, and resuming her
                  own—"That's the way she does, ma'am; it's good as a play to hear her."</p>
               <p>"I must go," said Viola quickly, turning to her little friend; "but can't you come
                  with me?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," chimed Grey, "do let me take her with us, Mrs. Irving; I know all your ways
                  with the children, and will take good care of her. Mr. Walsingham will be pleased
                  to have her visit his little girl, I know."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Irving would have said <emph>no,</emph> but the large brown eyes of Viola
                  were upturned with such a look of anxious appeal that she hesitated.</p>
               <p>"Please, let her go," said the child; "we will be very good, and I want to show
                  Mr. Walsingham what a dear little thing she is!"</p>
               <p>The mother's heart was touched by the unconscious flattery, and the mother's heart
                  was stirred for the lonely child so sweetly pleading.</p>
               <p>When Walsingham entered the child's room that night, to take a good-night look at
                  his treasure, there were two fair young heads upon the pillow—two tiny forms
                  nestling in childish embrace.</p>
               <p>The next day, when the somewhat anxious Mrs. Irving drove to the Eyrie to reclaim
                  her child, she was charmed by the cordial politeness with which its proprietor
                  thanked her for the favour of Helen's visit, and begged that she would soon permit
                  her to return.</p>
               <p>From that time visits were constantly interchanged by the little people. Mrs.
                  Irving felt the liveliest interest in Viola; her beauty and peculiarity, as well
                  as her desolate condition, appealing powerfully to the prompt sympathies of the
                  lady.</p>
               <p>No pleasure was ever prepared for her own children that Viola did not share; and
                  often, in arranging some pretty garment for her daughters, she thoughtfully
                  prepared a similar one for the child which in her heart she had adopted.</p>
               <p>Walsingham recognised in her those qualities which he had desired to shed their
                  influence around the life of Viola. Her delicacy, her tact, her tenderness, her
                  acute perceptions, rendered her a valuable friend. He gradually accustomed himself
                  to consult her womanly judgment, and rely upon her advice in all matters
                  pertaining to the child.</p>
               <p>The little Irvings were all fond of Viola. Their mother had told them her sad
                  little history, contrasting it with their own happy lot. They were taught by her
                  to thank the Good Father who had placed them in a loving home, and to show their
                  gratitude by kindness to the little unfortunate: and of this good seed some fell
                  upon good ground, and some fell among thorns. Viola's name was so often used in
                     their<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC5981-00000035"/> nursery to point a moral, that
                  they regarded her as a heroine of romance. Mary, a blue-eyed, blue-veined, womanly
                  little girl, delighted to play "<emph>mother</emph>" with the motherless one, and
                  with sober mimicry assumed the dignity and tenderness of a young matron toward her
                  charge. Howard, a headstrong, self-willed, beautiful boy, insisted upon her being
                  his horse, his dog, his anything, so that he engrossed and tyrannized over her to
                  the exclusion of others.</p>
               <p>This flattering preference was attended with disagreeable consequences. The young
                  gentleman, to render his illusions perfect, bestowed upon his playmates such
                  treatment as he considered due the animals they represented. More than once, when
                  running in harness for his amusement, did Viola receive such blows as left great
                  welts upon her shoulders, and sent her weeping to the sympathizing arms of her
                  little "<emph>mamma.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Howard!" cried Mary upon one such an occasion, "how dare you be so cruel?
                  Look how you have hurt her;" and she showed him the red stripe of his whip on her
                  pretty neck.</p>
               <p>His face flushed with shame; but it was not in embryo manhood to make an
                  acknowledgment. On second thoughts he perceived that <emph>he</emph> was the
                  aggrieved party, and made a decided demonstration of resentment.</p>
               <p>"She sha'n't be my pony if she cries," said the young despot. "Pshaw! what a
                  baby!"</p>
               <p>"Because you struck her, naughty boy!"</p>
               <p>"She was my <emph>pony,</emph> and I had a right to strike her! I won't let you
                  play any more, Cross-Patch."</p>
               <p>"Poor little thing, don't cry!" said Mary, tenderly rocking her in her arms;
                  "there, there—Howard, she is so little and tender, how could you be so rough!"</p>
               <p>"I was only in play, I tell you, and did not mean to hurt her. She always ends in
                  a cry—she did the last time."</p>
               <p>"Because you are always rude, and hurt her. You did this once before, and mamma
                  thought it was an accident. She told you to be careful, as she would punish you if
                  it happened again. Come, kiss her and tell her you're sorry, and we will not say
                  anything more about it."</p>
               <p>Viola wiped her eyes and turned her lips towards him; but the offended majesty of
                  boyhood refused the proffered conciliation, and sulked down the garden walk
                  decapitating the dahlias of which mamma was proud.</p>
               <p>These children were both older than Viola. Little Helen, the pet and plaything of
                  the household, although her own age, seemed scarcely a companion for Viola. Howard
                  alternately attracted her girlish heart by his superb beauty, and repulsed by his
                  inexplicable perverseness. Of gentle, loving Mary she was most fond.</p>

               <p>TIRED with play, and tormented with prickly-heat, the child Viola sat within the
                  shaded piazza, and wondered why the sky was so burnished, the earth so baked, and
                  the air so still; why her own little heart beat so faintly, and desire had failed;
                  why Widow White eschewed the too ardent sunshine, and Bully Bluster drooped his
                  wings dozily upon his perch, in peaceful truce with pigeon kind; why the stilled
                  fowls had betaken themselves to unknown depths of shade, and the busy Eyrie world
                  had grown so strangely solitary.</p>
               <p>It was very oppressive! The silence and solitude, as well as the heat, and Viola
                  believed she should cry; no, she wouldn't, she would call the cat. Chloe came, but
                  in no better mood than her mistress. She laid her head in Viola's lap with a
                  ferocious purr which seemed to say "noli me tangere." Viola did not thus interpret
                  it, and by way of inspiriting ing herself and her feline friend, she indulged in
                  the amiable pleasantries of tweaking her ears, and pulling her tail. Then puss
                  drew off her gloves for a boxing match, and showing teeth and nails (the only
                  specks of white about the black beast), assumed a look that of itself might have
                  earned her reputation of a witch's familiar. Indignant and alarmed at this
                  demonstration, the little maiden dismissed her favourite in disgrace, and resigned
                  herself again to solitude and silence. But solitude and silence are obnoxious to
                  little maidens. To our little maiden they were especially so; and, bethinking
                  herself of her quondam playfellows, the chickens, she sallied out into the
                  blistering sunshine in search of them.</p>
               <p>Then, for the first time, Walsingham through the blinds of his study observed her.
                  To a man of different mould she would have been a tired child, on a visit to
                  certain barnyard fowls, attended by a diabolical black cat, "and nothing
                  more."</p>
               <p>But he was one of those contemplative and imaginative men to whom existence is
                  twofold and doubly bounteous. For such the real and ideal blend their varied
                  sweets; like travellers amid the profuse vegetation of the tropics, they gather
                  from the same bough simultaneous fruits and flowers. He had a moment before looked
                  out upon the midday hush of nature, and with a certain gorgeousness of imagery
                  fancied her a beauteous queen, lapped in the profound quietude of an enchanted
                  repose, when lo! to the disenthralment, dissolving the spell by a more potent
                  charm of her own, flitted the fay-like, ethereal child.</p>
               <p>As though to indulge his fancy at this juncture, the ubiquitous<pb n="72-73"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000037"/> tous mocking-birds took upon themselves the rôle of
                  genii contending for their endangered spells. With arrowy rush and gliding flight
                  they boldly intercepted the child, and filled the air with cries of threatening
                  and remonstrance. Now pausing on the rose trees in her path, they peered
                  audaciously in her face, with a meaning in their glittering eyes that seemed
                  almost human; then circling about her like winged serpents, they screamed in
                  wrathful clamour—chut—chut—twitter—twitter—mew—mew—mew.</p>
               <p>Viola paused in alarm, and while she continued motionless her little adversaries
                  were silent. Their wary, watchful eyes were fastened on her, and her first
                  movement toward retreat was checked by a storm of wild outcries.</p>
               <p>"Certes," quoth Walsingham, hastening to the rescue of the frightened child,
                  "these wierd birds must have led the concert of mocking voices on the enchanted
                  hill."</p>
               <p>"What do they say? what do they mean?" exclaimed Viola, as she hid her face in his
                  bosom.</p>
               <p>"They are telling my little girl a secret," said he, soothingly, as a mother
                  might, yet with a touch of his quaint fancy.</p>
               <p>The child upraised her face and smiled, then looked troubled as she remembered her
                  fright, and said: "I don't want them to talk to me that way;—but I wish I knew the
                  secret."</p>
               <p>A faint expression of sarcasm flitted over the fine face of Walsingham as he
                  said—</p>
               <p>"What a notable little woman you are, to look so closely after a secret!"</p>
               <p>Viola's little heart swelled with pride, for she thought there was something
                  extremely complimentary in this. Ambition was not so busy with the turbulent
                  elements of poets, priests, warriors, and kings, but he found time to whisper to
                  this gentle one, a promise of triumphant womanhood.</p>
               <p>"Where is my little girl going in this heat?"</p>
               <p>"To see the chickens."</p>
               <p>"Call them."</p>
               <p>Viola called as she was bidden; but her usually prompt feathered friends did not
                  appear. A low, timid, lugubrious chuckle, was heard in response, however; and
                  searching in the direction of the sound, Walsingham found the flock ambushed in a
                  brush-heap.</p>
               <p>"Your pets are frightened, as well as yourself," said Walsingham, as he returned
                  to the house closely attended by the audacious and vigilant mocking-birds.</p>
               <p>Viola having procured bread, scattered it in the path and called encouragingly to
                  her chickens. A disheartened murmur of consultation was heard among them, when one
                  adventurous spirit emerged from the brush-heap fortification, and proceeded to
                  regale himself upon her bounty. With the flashing fierceness of enraged eagles,
                  the uncanny birds swooped at his head, and the lubberly poltroon fled to cover, as
                  fast as his long limbs would carry him.</p>
               <p>Walsingham smiled at the ludicrous display of fierceness and timidity, while Viola
                  exclaimed, with tears in her eyes, "Oh, why do they do so?"</p>
               <p>"To guard the secret."</p>
               <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC5981-00000038"/>
               <p>"What can the secret be?"</p>
               <p>"I will tell you," said he.</p>
               <p>"You know! oh how did you find it out? Tell me! tell me!" she cried.</p>
               <p>"Which? the secret, or how I found it out?"</p>
               <p>"Both—but the secret first."</p>
               <p>"Well, first then, Mr. Mocking-bird built a nest in the apple tree, and Mrs.
                  Mocking-bird placed two delicate eggs therein. These were their beautiful and
                  precious treasures. She pressed them close to her warm bosom for many days, when
                  at last the enamelled walls parted, and a tiny mockingbird stepped forth to life
                  from each."</p>
               <p>"Is it a fairy story?" interrupted the child.</p>
               <p>"What <emph>is</emph> a fairy story, little one?"</p>
               <p>"A fairy story is something wonderful and beautiful—just like that."</p>
               <p>"Is a fairy story a history of marvellous and impossible events, accomplished by
                  supernatural agency?"</p>
               <p>The child did not reply in words: perhaps she did not quite understand; but a
                  conviction that it must be as he had said, impelled her to execute a series of
                  sagacious nods, with the most beautifully poised head in the world.</p>
               <p>"It must be a fairy story then," said the guardian, "for it is certainly
                  marvellous that a bird should be packed in a ball no bigger than a hazel-nut. The
                  mocking-birds could not have placed it there of themselves."</p>
               <p>"Couldn't you?"</p>
               <p>"No, I could not."</p>
               <p>"But this story is real, and fairy stories are not!"</p>
               <p>"Well, then, if the birds are not able to do this thing of themselves, and there
                  are not any fairies to help them, how was it brought about, I wonder?"</p>
               <p>"God must have helped them," said Viola, "for He can do everything, and He
                     <emph>is real.</emph> Is this the secret?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. It is for the sake of those little ones that they are jealous of every
                  living thing that moves across their garden world. Affection is a potent agent of
                  transformation: under the influence of a new and great love these timid birds have
                  grown lion-hearted. Yesterday they were shy and gentle; today they are wrathful
                  and bold."</p>
               <p>"Oh, they are dreadful!" said the child, who had been thoroughly alarmed by their
                  violent demonstrations.</p>
               <p>"They would be," said her guardian, "if their power equalled their will. There is
                  no fierceness so terrible in bird, beast, or man, as that which is rooted in
                  affection."</p>
               <p>Much of this was above the child's comprehension, as his remarks often were; but
                  her growing mind reached forth its tendrils to grasp his meaning, and so grew
                  upward to the light.</p>

               <p>"IF Death is cruel, Time is kind," said Walsingham, turning from the library
                  window. "I thought, Mrs. Irving, when I saw the wild grief of that little child
                  over her dying mother, that she would die of sorrow; and now look! a happier mote
                  never sported in the sunshine of existence!"</p>
               <p>"There is so much hope in a child's heart that grief is not very abiding,"
                  answered the lady.</p>
               <p>"I don't know much about children," said the Captain, "but, by Saturn's self, I
                  could devour this one! If they are all so charming, I don't understand that
                  economy of nature which permits them to spindle up to womanhood. Beg pardon,
                  ma'am," he added, suddenly remembering he had been guilty of an indiscretion.</p>
               <p>"What do you say, Ben, about devouring the child? I believe you have been so much
                  among cannibals that you would 'grind her bones to make your bread.'"</p>
               <p>"She's a plump little thing, and would be tender picking," quoth the Captain
                  grimly. "And who knows but she may come to a worse end?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Irving laughed—"The Captain is dispirited by the prospect of an angelic child
                  declining, by slow degrees, into a faulty woman."</p>
               <p>"Yes, in faith! I shall be terribly shy of Viola, if she ever reaches that
                  dignity. How will we bachelors manage her?"</p>
               <p>"I give myself no uneasiness on that score, expecting to be the
                     <emph>managed,</emph>" said Walsingham; "I advise you to resign yourself to the
                  same prospective fate. Perhaps her womanhood will reconcile you to woman, as her
                  childhood has overcome your horror of children. When Viola first came to the
                  Eyrie, he was more afraid of her than a pestilence, and now he is in the most
                  abject servitude to her whims."</p>
               <p>"I am not surprised. Children have spells and enchantments of their own by which
                  they work their will. In my creed they are but half human."</p>
               <p>"Pray expound, and we will promise to be stout believers," petitioned Walsingham,
                  who of late loved to hear about children.</p>
               <p>"I have often thought," she answered, in a sweet earnest womanly way, that charmed
                  one, perhaps both gentlemen, "I have often thought, when looking into the face of
                  an infant, that though born of an earthly mother, the young spirit is born of God.
                  It is a newly created angel that descends from heaven and becomes a little
                  child."</p>
               <p>There were tears in Mrs. Irving's eyes as she added, "Those to whom the Father
                  lends his angels, should keep<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC5981-00000040"/> them
                  unspotted, remembering they are to be <emph>restored</emph> to the Hierarchy of
                  Heaven."</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, the Captain, who was not of a speculative turn, wandered to the window
                  and counted the fowls. That interesting family, having outgrown the graces of
                  early chickhood, and degenerated into a brood of tall, gaunt hobble-de-hoys, were
                  in playful pursuit of a fat grasshopper in seven-leagued boots. Viola, too, joined
                  the chase with great ardour, and seemed as likely to succeed in capturing the
                  quarry as any of the party, when the Captain summoned her to the library, and
                  presented her to their guest.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Irving received her with motherly caresses, and announced that the object of
                  her visit was to claim her for a few days. Howard's birth-day was to be celebrated
                  with great festivity on the morrow, and the children would expect Viola.</p>
               <p>"Oh," said the little lady, shaking her curls, "I would love to go, but I'm afraid
                  I cannot leave Mr. Walsingham so long."</p>
               <p>Mr. Walsingham looked flattered, for a man may be flattered by a child; and the
                  Captain declared she was a conceited little puppet to suppose that her littleship
                  was of any consequence to anybody; and, moreover, an ungrateful lump of granite
                  never to think of him, when he should fret himself into a fever while she was
                  away; which volley of abuse was punctuated by sundry uncouth kisses of various
                  degrees, answering to comma, colon, period, etc.</p>
               <p>"Why, can't you leave Mr. Walsingham, my dear? I'm sure he would like you to
                  go."</p>
               <p>"Would you?" she said, appealing to him with a doubtful air. "Mrs. Grey says you
                     <emph>are lost</emph> when I go away, and I thought I would stay and take care
                  of you."</p>
               <p>"If he does get <emph>lost,</emph> popinjay, one need but look between the covers
                  of his books to find him; but what is to become of an old sea-dog like myself, I
                  should like to know? Who'll tell Mrs. Grey what I like for dinner, or hunt me up,
                  if I forget all about tea? Who'll take pains to teach me the comfortable usages of
                  middle-aged gentlemen in the matters of dressing-gown and slippers? Who'll be
                  pertinacious on the subjects of tobacco and boots, and unceasing in her efforts to
                  make a gentleman of me like yonder model man, and failing in that, to save me from
                  the consequences, in the shape of the wrathful Mrs. Grey? hey?"</p>
               <p>"Never mind, uncle Captain," said the important little lady in a tone of soothing.
                  "Never mind, uncle Captain, I'll stay with you."</p>
               <p>"That will not be necessary," interposed the guardian, "I'll have an eye to his
                  comfort, and superintend his reformation, while you are gone; so run and tell Mrs.
                  Grey to equip you."</p>
               <p>The child disappeared, but quickly came running back.</p>
               <p>"I'll tell you, uncle Captain!" said she brightly. "Do all the time just as
                     <emph>he</emph> does, and then Mrs. Grey will love you!"</p>
               <p>"Umph!" growled the ungrateful Captain, "I should hang myself at the yard-arm if
                  she did!"</p>
               <p>It was not until Viola had been absent for a few days, that Walsingham found how
                  large a place in the house she filled. No musical voice filled the air with
                  chimes, no little footfall woke the Eyrie echoes. The flowers on his study table,
                  sweet dewy<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC5981-00000041"/> flowers of her gathering, grew
                  nauseous and stale, and the dinner-table lacked a presence more piquant than sauce
                  or condiment.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Winter closed around that mountain home, but Walsingham was neither moody nor
                  lonely as of yore. There was a bright presence hovering near him, smiling eyes
                  looking into his own, challenging smiles in turn, and an atmosphere of love around
                  him. The hitherto sad winter twilights were filled with music. The past became a
                     "<emph>dead</emph> past," and was buried with the dead Viola, while the
                  precious legacy she had left him led his thoughts, as childhood ever will, to the
                  promise of the future. Life had now an aim—the well-being and happiness of this
                  beloved child. He thanked God that he had not married, and that there were no
                  claims upon him that could conflict with, or weaken hers.</p>
               <p>And how shall I paint the love and reverence for him that filled the child's
                  heart? In her eyes he was indeed "little lower than the angels, and crowned with
                  glory and honour." He was the king of her young life, who could do no wrong; the
                  omnipotent, whose arm could never fail; the munificent genie, who surrounded her
                  life with enchantments. Oh, the faith of loving childhood, which thus invests its
                  guardians with the attributes of gods. Alas for the judgment of mature years,
                  before which the illusive and imagined perfections vanish as mists before the sun!
                  and alas for those who live to see their little ones disenchanted!</p>
               <p>Upon these proemial chapters I have lingered too long for my reader—not long
                  enough for myself. A child's prattle echoes in my heart with which I would fain
                  fill pages, loving as I do that unconscious wisdom which proceeds from the mouths
                  of babes. But years are passing, our Viola is hastening up to womanhood, and we
                  must travel on with her.</p>

               <p>AFTER a six years' cruise, Captain Ben returned to find Viola six years older, at
                  which he stormed most terribly, calling on the heathen gods in a manner shocking
                  to the feelings of any who maintained a decent reverence for those old divinities.
                  The artful Viola contrived to appease his wrath, and reconcile him to the new
                  phase in her life by showing off the graces of twelve years old, and promising she
                  would "never grow any more as long as she lived; no, never!" Which promise she
                  doubtless kept to the best of her ability.</p>
               <p>"Well, well," said he, considerately, "if she has grown tall and thin, and
                  smoothed her curls into tails like John Chinaman's, and dropped her lisp, one must
                  love her, notwithstanding."</p>
               <p>"Viola is very pretty," remarked Walsingham, in whose eyes she possessed the
                  beauty of a seraph.</p>
               <p>"Humph! a plain little nondescript, neither child nor woman! I always knew she
                  would grow up!" retorted the dissatisfied captain.</p>
               <p>To which his brother replied, "You were very sagacious."</p>
               <p>The Captain, finding that Viola persisted in her upward course, despite his
                  remonstrances, and her promises to the contrary, bethought him that it was time
                  she should be learning something that would be useful to her in life.</p>
               <p>Recalling with pride his own early accomplishments, he proceeded at once to
                  initiate her in the mysteries of "hunting, fishing, and war," as the school books
                  have it. She tramped valiantly by his side through the forests of the Bluff,
                  where, if a squirrel leaped, or a bird fluttered, the Captain would transfer his
                  fowling-piece to her hands, drop on one knee before her that she might rest the
                  barrel upon his shoulder, and give the word—"make ready—take
                     aim—<emph>fire!</emph>"</p>
               <p>The little girl, excited by the novelty of her pursuit to bravery, would scatter
                  the forest leaves with her shot—but bird and squirrel escaped unscathed. In
                  fishing she was more successful; and often, under the Captain's supervision,
                  brought home a basket of fish from the stream.</p>
               <p>So thoroughly versed was she in the theory of naval tactics, that her instructor
                  pronounced her "almost fit to command a man o' war." To increase her
                  accomplishments he one day pitched her into the river, after having given her the
                  most accurate and scientific verbal treatise upon the art of swimming<pb n="84-85"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000043"/> ming. The poor victim bobbed about in helpless
                  terror until her oppressive protector plunged in and drew her forth half
                  drowned.</p>
               <p>This adventure coming to the ears of Mrs. Irving, she paid the Eyrie a visit of
                  remonstrance; upon which occasion she conveyed to the Captain's mind a vague
                  impression that she was incapable of appreciating his qualifications as an
                  instructor of youth, of the softer sex.</p>
               <p>"Do you mean to say you don't approve of Viola's learning to swim?" he cried.
                  "Why, d—no! <emph>bless</emph> you, it's a most necessary bit of knowledge, and
                  may save her life some day. Let me tell you, madam, if you don't know how to swim
                  yourself, your early education has been very much neglected."</p>
               <p>"I would rather die than learn."</p>
               <p>"In the name of Mars, what would you have me do?" he broke forth. "Teach her
                  knitting, netting, and crochet? Jupiter Ammon! I must learn myself, first. By
                  Vulcan's self, if she expects to learn from me, she must be content with the
                  knowledge I possess!"</p>
               <p>"Now, in the name of all the Gods at once!" interposed Walsingham, laughing,
                  "don't you think Vulcan's self would be as suitable for a preceptor of ladies? Yet
                  we nowhere read of his attempting to impart to Venus (or any other female mind
                  over which he exerted influence) the mysteries of the smithy!"</p>
               <p>"A worthy example," quoth the culprit Captain. "Henceforth I shall keep my
                  stupendous knowledge for individual use, and abandon the project of making a
                  Leander out of that squeamish pigeon's heart."</p>
               <p>"Or a Nimrod," suggested Mrs. Irving.</p>
               <p>"Or a Walton," added Walsingham.</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes!" replied the ill-used sailor; "but, by George! my teachings are as
                  useful as your own, Arthur. What earthly advantage is she to derive from your
                  Latin conjugations, I would like to know?"</p>
               <p>Walsingham appealed to Mrs. Irving in defence of his teaching, but that lady did
                  not approve of Latin for Viola at present. She was very young, and had much to
                  learn, of which Latin seemed to be the least. She was a fragile flower, and too
                  much application, too many studies, might impair her health and spirits—therefore
                  Latin had better be laid aside for the present.</p>
               <p>"Ho, ho, ho!" laughed the Captain, restored to good humour by this condemnation of
                  his brother's instruction. "Break the spirit, indeed!" and he roared again with
                  boisterous hilarity.</p>
               <p>"I don't think her spirit is quite spoiled yet! Did you hear how she horsewhipped
                  young Tonks last week?"</p>
               <p>"What <emph>do</emph> you mean?" inquired Mrs. Irving, nervously.</p>
               <p>"Why, you see," replied Captain Ben, rising with the excitement of a narrator, "we
                  drive a good deal around the country with the new grays; that is, <emph>she</emph>
                  drives, and I go along to insure the safety of the concern."</p>
               <p>"<emph>She</emph> drives?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, superbly! I taught her myself! Last week we<pb n="86-87"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000044"/> stopped at Tonks's house on some business for Mrs.
                  Grey. I was in a hurry to get to town before the mail closed, and finding we would
                  be detained, I told the child I would walk on, and she should drive after, when
                  she got through with her affairs."</p>
               <p>"Good heavens, Ben! with those restive animals?"</p>
               <p>"Playful, only playful, and innocent as lambs. Young Tonks officiously took them
                  out of harness; and when Viola was ready he had the pleasure of tackling them up
                  again. The horses capered a good deal, and they tried to detain the child until I
                  should return; but she said she had been told to drive on, and she would do it—she
                  knew I would wait until she did—that the horses were not dangerous, and she could
                  manage them. 'Now, sir,' said she, in her soft way, to young Tonks, as he stood
                  holding their heads. 'When I am in, pray don't hold the horses, for they won't
                  bear it.' The old man lifted her in, and the moment the beasts felt her weight in
                  the carriage, they began to plunge and struggle. 'Let go,' cried Viola, as she
                  gathered up the reins. 'Hold on,' shouted the old man in terror. 'Let go, and
                  there is no danger,' implored the child. 'Hold on, hold on, for mercy's sake,'
                  roared old Tonks, and the young un held on like a lobster to a cat's paw, while
                  the frantic beasts reared, lifting their tormentor from his feet. At this moment
                  Viola thought of a means of delivering herself from the peril. Abandoning her
                  unheeded beseechings, she stood up in the curricle. Drawing her tiny figure to its
                  full height, with reins gathered resolutely in one hand, and whip in the other,
                  she laid the lash smartly about the head and face of her stupid detainer. Startled
                  and stung by this attack he instinctively recoiled, and the horses thundering down
                  the road dashed into the bridge, where, feeling the planks under their feet, the
                  noble old thoroughbreds fell into the prescribed walk, with a regard for the
                  supremacy of the law that entitles them to the respect of all good citizens."</p>
               <p>"This cannot be true, Captain Walsingham!" said Mrs. Irving, looking very white;
                  "you are amusing yourself at our expense."</p>
               <p>"Ask old Tonks! He says he never was so frightened in his life as when he saw the
                  impatient animals leap off. He ran after to pick up the child when the concern
                  should be dashed to pieces; but when he heard the slow tramp of the animals' hoofs
                  in the bridge, he thought '<emph>the gal knowed de hosses and de hosses knowed de
                     gal;</emph>' and so he returned, lit his pipe, and took a smoke upon it."</p>
               <p>"I am amazed that you should have been so fool-hardy!" exclaimed Walsingham, in
                  displeasure.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Me</emph> fool-hardy? bless you! 'twas young Tonks," said the incorrigible
                  old salt.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Irving," cried Walsingham, "tell me what I am to do with the poor
                  child."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Irving answered as though her mind had been settled upon that point long
                  before, that she thought Viola should be sent to school.</p>
               <p>"I have an aversion to boarding-schools, and should prefer a governess."</p>
               <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC5981-00000045"/>
               <p>"I don't doubt it," said Captain Ben; "your candour is quite refreshing. Let us
                  have a governess for ourselves immediately."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Irving smiled, while Walsingham laughed outright. "I see," said he, "a legion
                  of lions in the way."</p>
               <p>"I really think," said Mrs. Irving persuasively, "that a boarding-school would be
                  better for Viola than the best governess. She is a singularly unsophisticated and
                  unworldly child, and needs that contact with children of her own age which will
                  fit her for intercourse with the world."</p>
               <p>"Those qualities in my little girl's character possess for me a wonderful charm.
                  Why should I expose her to a discipline which will impair them?"</p>
               <p>"They are beautiful in the child, but dangerous to the woman. Viola will be a
                  woman soon, and it is better she should know something of the world in miniature,
                  before she enters upon its real life. She will not lose her own beautiful
                  individuality, nor will she grow worldly when she knows the world. Contact with
                  evil will not harm her, because she has no affinity with it. It passes from her
                  pure nature like water from the breast of a swan."</p>
               <p>"By Jupiter! madam, you're a sensible woman after all!" shouted the impulsive
                  Captain.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Irving was one of those low-voiced, persuasive women, who pass through life
                  for ever having their own way. They never conceive a project that they do not
                  carry; they never advocate a measure that does not succeed. When Mrs. Irving said,
                  "Don't you think, my dear, you had better do this? on that?" you were sure to
                  think so; or if you did not so think then, you did ten minutes afterward, and you
                  did ten years after. There was an infallibility about the woman.</p>
               <p>"I have resolved to send Viola to school," said Walsingham, on the morrow, to Mrs.
                  Grey.</p>
               <p>"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Grey, in turn to Chloe. "Yesterday, when I told Mrs.
                  Irving about the Captain throwing of Miss Viola into the water, she said, 'Mrs.
                  Grey, this will never do! that child must go to school;' and she put on her things
                  and rode home with me, pussy; by which I knew the thing was fixed. I'll declare
                  that woman rules affairs here just as she does at home; and, although we live with
                  Mr. Walsingham, Mrs. Irving is our mistress. Get out, Cuff! You're Mrs. Irving's
                  dog, too, although, like a stupid brute, you don't know it."</p>
               <p>Poor Mrs. Grey was restive under this counter-influence in her domain. The "thing
                     <emph>was fixed,</emph>" as she said. Viola was to be placed under the care of
                  one Madame De Fleury, in a distant metropolis, who was, as you might gather from
                  her prospectus, an admirable Crichton in petticoats, able and willing to impart
                  all the gifts of nature, and accomplishments of art, for a given amount of filthy
                  lucre.</p>
               <p>During the years to be spent by Viola at school, Walsingham determined to travel.
                  The Captain would sail again ere long, and he resolved to cross the ocean with
                  him, and afterward follow the guidance of his errant fancy. In a short time the
                  Eyrie was deserted.</p>
               <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC5981-00000046"/>
               <p>More wierd-like than ever seemed this house set upon a hill, when its doors closed
                  upon the departing inmates, and silence and solitude divided the realm. As years
                  passed, the bats and the owls built their nests in its porches, and the wild birds
                  reared their young beneath its eaves, while desolation and decay filled its
                  pleasant places. But still it reared its bold front to the sky, and spread abroad
                  its walls to the storm, and stood defiant, like a giant in his fastness!</p>

               <p>MARY IRVING was now a tall, fragile girl. She had always been a delicate child;
                  but her form seemed more slender, her cheek more pale, and the blue veins more
                  distinct upon her temples than ever. She was wearied after slight effort, and no
                  longer cared for play.</p>
               <p>Her father called her his sedate little girl—his Minerva; and said she grew more
                  womanly every day. But Mrs. Irving regarded her with a troubled heart, fearing
                  that womanhood might never dawn upon this dear child.</p>
               <p>Very dear she was to both parents, but especially to the father. The mother's
                  heart was equally divided among her children; but to his first-born he accorded
                  the largest share of that sweet fountain of affection which she had opened in<pb
                     n="92-93" xml:id="VAC5981-00000047"/> his heart. She was most like her mother,
                  and dear in proportion as that mother was dear. The delicacy of her face and
                  figure; the softness of her movements, no less than her tender, loving nature,
                  appealed to his manliness for love and shelter.</p>
               <p>Helen had grown rosy and hoydenish; every body laughed at and spoiled her, except
                  Howard, who spoiled no one but himself. He was his own especial pet. Proud,
                  passionate, and turbulent was he, with a splendour of beauty like a rebellious
                  angel.</p>
               <p>He was endowed with great gifts, for good or evil, and his mother felt the serious
                  responsibilities attaching to the possession of a child like this. She sacrificed
                  much, and endured more for him, striving the while to cultivate his affections,
                  sharpen his moral perceptions, and strengthen his principles; sometimes her heart
                  glowed with a prophecy of his greatness, while at others it shrank from the
                  contemplation of his doubtful manhood. Through all, she diligently sowed good
                  seed, and waited the result.</p>
               <p>Time moved on, the air filled with frost, the river congealed, and earth was
                  winter-bound. Mrs. Irving's usually serene heart was filled with appalling
                  apprehensions, for a deadlier frost was blighting the fairest flower that ever
                  bloomed for her.</p>
               <p>Mary's debility increased. She loved to lie all day upon the sofa in her mamma's
                  room, listening to old ballads, or hymns, that her mother would repeat for her
                  beguilement. Mrs. Irving was surprised to find how her memory was stored with
                  these gems of poesy. Poetic legends, read and forgotten long ago, seemed to return
                  in her need, and pour from her lips without any mental effort of her own. It
                  seemed as if all her mind had ever rested upon had become its own—and from its
                  vast treasure-house she drew forth rich stores for the gratification of her sick
                  child.</p>
               <p>Alas, poor mother! 'twas with a breaking heart she spoke!</p>
               <p>Disease dealt gently with his young victim. As her physical energies decayed, her
                  mind brightened, reaching to the companionship of her elders. Conversations with
                  this dear child became the sole pleasure of the apprehensive mother. The
                  reflections of her pure mind were fraught with quaint and startling wisdom. Many
                  of her expressions, simple yet wonderful, were treasured in the mother's memory,
                  and when the time came, as come it did, that she felt herself to be the mother of
                  an angel, she pondered these sayings in her heart, as did that Blessed Maiden who
                  performed the office of maternity to Divinity.</p>
               <p>Mary's bed was removed from the nursery, and placed beside her mother's. The
                  anxious woman lay nightly with her child's small hand clasped in her own, that
                  even in sleep she might not lose the consciousness of that fast-fleeting presence.
                  If the child waked she knew it instantly, and awakening also, beguiled with
                  converse,—oh, how touching and holy!—the watches of the night.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Mary, darling, I wish I could see you sleep!" she cried one night, when for
                  hours she had watched the unearthly gleam of the child's eye.</p>
               <p>"Do not lie awake for me, mamma. I am not lonely now.<pb n="94-95"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000048"/> The air seems filled with something—I cannot
                  tell—something peaceful and happy."</p>
               <p>Did her spiritual ken dimly recognise the presence of God's invisible angels? The
                  mother thought so, and hastily attired herself.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Soft as a summer twilight she faded from the earth, and through the night of
                  grief, that darkly closed around the bereaved, the memory of her lovely life shone
                  like a star.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>The strong heart of the father seemed impotent in grief, but the weak mother was
                  strong in Christian faith.</p>
               <p>"Why was she given us," he groaned, in rebellious anguish, "to be so soon
                  recalled! Oh, that she had never been born!"</p>
               <p>"Not so," said the mother, chastened tears filling her meek eyes. "Her daily life
                  was a blessing, for which I thank my God, and although its continuance has been
                  withheld, I cannot feel the less grateful. We have lost our child, but to have
                  once possessed her, to have had her in our midst for a brief space, an angel
                  messenger, unsealing fountains of feeling in our hearts which must henceforth flow
                  heavenward: this has been one of God's signal blessings on our lives. He has
                  recalled his own, leaving us bereaved; but the remembrance of her lovely life
                  shall beautify our own, and the thought that by her brief and peaceful mission
                  here, she has won Heaven's eternity, is one which yearning love may feed upon in
                  thankfulness."</p>
               <p>"God hath granted you a clearer faith, because you are of purer heart," he
                  answered.</p>
               <p>"My faith <emph>is</emph> clear," she said. "Heaven seems so near, since it hath
                  become the home of my child. I humbly exult in the thought that one of its
                  brightest angels shall meet me at the threshold of light, as I go hence, and hail
                  me 'mother.' "</p>
               <p>"Teach me to feel as you do," he cried, laying his head upon her bosom, and
                  abandoning himself to grief. "The constant cry of my heart is, give her back, oh,
                  give her back to me."</p>
               <p>"Hush!" she said, smoothing his brow with her cool fingers; and his grief
                     <emph>was hushed</emph> by her soft voice and touch.</p>
               <p>"I loved her as tenderly, I miss her precious presence more keenly than you can
                  do, yet I dare not wish for her recall. If, like the Shunamite woman, I had
                  influence with God to win the revocation of His decree, I should hesitate to speak
                  the word that would recall my child. Think—think of the toil, the travail, the
                  care, the anguish, the temptation, the besetting sins of life, that rage in vain
                  along her earthward path, while her serene soul securely folds its wings in
                  Heaven. The loss is ours only; can we not be comforted by the knowledge of our
                  darling's great gain? or is our love so selfish that it would seek to pluck her
                  down from heaven to gild our path, or share its darkness?"</p>
               <p>"How differently we think of our dead child!" he said, with a sigh. "To me, she
                  died and was <emph>buried;</emph> to you, she died and was <emph>beatified.</emph>
                  My heart follows the body mourning; your soul soars after her soul rejoicing. I
                  picture her childish beauty, coffined and delivered over to the corruption of
                     the<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC5981-00000049"/> charnel; you penetrate beyond
                  things seen, and behold her an immortal. I, too, believe in the life hereafter;
                  but my belief is an abstraction—yours a realization!"</p>
               <p>"The immortality of the soul! <emph>Immortality?</emph> Men have not all believed
                  this?"</p>
               <p>"Those who doubt the immortality of the soul have not been blessed in the death of
                  their beloved," she answered simply.</p>
               <p>"What mean you?"</p>
               <p>"I mean, they have not stood as I have done by the departing, and listened to the
                  revealings of an unfaltering spirit, made through failing flesh. They have not
                  witnessed those blessed transitions which, more than reason, carry convictions of
                  immortality. If I had been a pagan mother, unconscious of immortality, a
                  revelation of life hereafter would have dawned on my darkened mind by the
                  death-bed of my child. I should have felt that the principle of life was not
                  quenched, but departed. Oh, yes; Death is the most impressive teacher of
                  immortality."</p>
               <p>He bowed his head, musing upon her words; for on themes like these, women are
                  often teachers. Presently he soliloquized, in broken sentences, "Who shall control
                  his belief? Is not faith a gift of God? It cometh like the wind, one knoweth not
                  whence; but happy the heart on which it breathes. Wise men have survived the death
                  of their dearest, and with far-reaching intellect have scanned all space, hoping
                  to pierce Heaven's mysteries, yet have not learned this simple creed so full of
                  consolation. Vain—dark—"</p>
               <p>"Mary," he continued, rousing from revery, "God still spares my choicest blessing
                  in you, and if he withholds from my grosser mind that faith, thrice blessed, which
                  robs bereavement of its pangs, he, at least, vouchsafes me strength to wrestle and
                  endure."</p>
               <p>"Be patient, my husband, and time will bring you light."</p>

               <p>VIOLA! Poor Viola! What a shipwreck of joyous childhood was her transition from a
                  realm of affluent life, to the bald existence of a boarding-school! The secluded
                  home upon a mountain top had teemed with companionship, but the crowded
                  school-room was a solitude. Throughout all nature a Pentecost had reigned for this
                  imaginative child. The leaves of the forest were whispering tongues to her, and
                  the winds of the mountain, murmured in chorus, to the music swelling in her soul.
                  Cunning to interpret the voices of the wilderness, she sat down in the school-room
                  in dumb despair, as might the architect of Babel, amid the primal confusion of
                  tongues; an unsophisticated child amid child worldlings; a quick, untrammelled
                  intelligence, abashed in the presence of trained stupidity.</p>
               <p>The children in Madame de Fleury's establishment (I ask pardon, there was nought
                  savouring of childhood there, unless it might be a lingering taste for bonbons),
                  the <emph>young ladies,</emph> presented the same variety of character you will
                  meet at Mrs. De Smyth's ball. There were vain, silly misses; pert, forward misses;
                  haughty, arrogant misses; and humble, toad-eating misses. (Fancy a child veiling
                  the transparency of childhood with toadyism!) There were, here and there, sensible
                  misses, but they did not appear to any better advantage than does the excellent
                  Mrs. Homemade, at the brilliant assemblage to which we have before alluded. Their
                  plain gifts were unsuited to their present sphere, and they shrank in corners as
                  if they were ashamed. Had they read Shakspeare, they would have been ready to
                  exclaim with the melancholy Jaques, "Motley's the only wear."</p>
               <p>There were also, enthusiastic misses, but they expended their raptures upon such
                  articles of dry goods as are devised from time to time for the beguilement of the
                  female mind, or the "elegant," "splendid, "glorious" opera to which mamma took
                  them upon her birthnight. On these, and similar exciting topics, they exhausted
                  their vocabulary of superlatives.</p>
               <p>"The proper study of mankind is man," sang the poet. In Madame De Fleury's
                  establishment Viola made some progress in this branch of knowledge, albeit not
                  specified in that lady's prospectus. The deceitful, cringing, arrogant,
                  pretentious world was before her, and first in shocked amaze, then in proud
                  contempt she surveyed it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Irving was right in saying she had no affinity with evil. Her instincts
                  revolted against—her moral culture elevated her above it; and so, uncontaminated
                  by the examples around her, she held on her own pure path. She quietly presented
                  her simple composition, knowing that some of the<pb n="100-101"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000051"/> finest paragraphs from the Spectator would be found
                  in the lists against her. She laboured over her exercises, unseduced by the
                  fairest copies surreptitiously obtained from the teacher's key. She did not feel
                  the slightest movings of tenderness for Miss White, although she came to school
                  every morning in a carriage; nor did the faded ribbons on Miss Jones's bonnet
                  awaken a desire to make mouths at the wearer.</p>
               <p>Oh school! Oh Pandemonium!</p>
               <p>A faint effort, was made by the amiable young herd, to set the new-comer up as a
                  butt. It was abandoned immediately, on the simultaneous discovery of her own
                  excellencies, and her guardian's wealth. So surely must merit command respect,
                  nay, worship, if placed on a golden pedestal.</p>
               <p>In time, the bachelor's ward became accustomed to the treadmill life, and familiar
                  with the jargon of schools. She became accomplished in music, proficient in
                  languages, and familiar with more "ologies" than I would care to enumerate. In the
                  attainment of these desirable perfections, "a world of happy days" and much of her
                  beautiful individuality was sacrificed. The exuberance of the wild vine was
                  pruned,—so skilfully that none perceived its bleeding. And, lo! a child who could
                  eat, drink, sleep, speak, and move, like nine hundred and ninety-nine other
                  children! So much for the <emph>seeming,</emph> but I doubt me, if the little
                  heart beat quite as equally.</p>
               <p>The happiest moments of her life were, when she received a closely-written packet
                  from Walsingham, or a kind motherly letter from Mrs. Irving. Upon these crumbs,
                  her affections fed. At the end of three years, a great pleasure was promised her,
                  in the companionship of her old playfellow, Helen. Mr. and Mrs. Irving brought her
                  to New York, and the delighted Viola dined with them, supped with them, saw sights
                  with them, until their stay was ended, and then she took the poor, forlorn little
                  Helen under her protection at Madame Fleury's.</p>
               <p>How she petted, and caressed, her new-found friend! How she listened to her sad
                  stories of poor Mary, or anecdotes of Howard, and questioned her about the Eyrie,
                  the river, and the town! How she comforted her home-sickness, and promised her
                  speedy deliverance when Mr. Walsingham should come! A desirable event, that for
                  the last two years of her life, had seemed immediately at hand. Poor little hoping
                  heart! two, three, four years passed, and still he came not.</p>

               <p>GENTLE little Mrs. Irving sat in her summer-house, busied with needle-work, when
                  she heard the quick tread of her husband on the gravel-walk. "Has anything
                  happened?" she inquired, with some solicitude, as he entered, for he was one of
                  those business men who rarely seek their homes in business hours.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said he, smiling, "I am horridly jealous: look at that!" and he held up a
                  letter, directed to Mrs. Irving, in an unfamiliar, manly hand.</p>
               <p>"You were very good to come home on purpose to bring it," she said, holding out
                  her hand to receive it.</p>
               <p>"Not at all; I was too curious to wait, and came home an hour before my time to
                  learn who has had the audacity to write to my little wife."</p>
               <p>"What a dear, good, stupid husband, not to know that it is from Walsingham,
                  announcing his intended return!" she said, as she surveyed the superscription.</p>
               <p>"What a sharp-eyed, clever little wife, to read it without breaking the seal!"</p>
               <p>"That is easily done; don't you see it is marked 'ship,' and as Mr. Walsingham is
                  the only acquaintance I have on the other side of the water, it can only be from
                  him. As he has never written to me before during his absence, I suppose it heralds
                  his return."</p>
               <p>"I had almost forgotten that such a man had ever lived; but then I never knew him
                  as you did. By the way, it was singular that you should have formed an intimacy,
                  with a man whom nobody knew."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Irving heard the last sentence, although immersed in her letter, and answered
                  quietly—</p>
               <p>"It was the children, you know."</p>
               <p>As Mr. Irving contemplates his wife, he affords us an opportunity of examining him
                  closely. Standing by her, he looks like a tower of strength, in which the little
                  lady may put her trust—a tall, sinewy man, with broad breast, ample brow, and open
                  countenance, over which a clear, full, gray eye sheds warmth, and light. Although,
                  neither handsome in appearance, nor elegant in manners, there is that in both
                  appearance and manner which commands respect. He is not social, owing partly to
                  the engrossing nature of his pursuits, and therefore is seldom seen in society
                  where his wife is so great an ornament. Among business men he sustains a
                  reputation for accuracy, prudence, justice, and integrity, and as a man among men
                  is much esteemed.</p>
               <p>As a faithful chronicler we must admit that in the bottom<pb n="104-105"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000053"/> of that great, strong heart, there nestles one
                  mortal weakness. Forgive it, men and angels—it is <emph>love!</emph>—love for that
                  little wife. He loved her with a true manliness when first he brought her to his
                  home a bride, and his love has grown with every circling year since then. The
                  ardour of youth has given place to manhood's earnestness, and all the illusions of
                  life have faded, save this early amaranthine flower, which crowns his sober years
                  with youthful freshness.</p>
               <p>"Well?" said he, in his short, quick way, as she laid the letter down.</p>
               <p>"There!" she answered, emulating his own brevity, and placing it in his hands.</p>
               <p>It was, as she surmised, from Walsingham, who had determined to return at last,
                  and wrote, he said, to solicit her kind offices for his young charge. He knew,
                  that after its prolonged desertion, the Eyrie would not be habitable, and begged
                  Mrs. Irving to find some suitable home in the village, for a few weeks, for his
                  little girl.</p>
               <p>"Little girl!" remarked Mr. Irving, as he folded the letter; "your friend writes
                  as if she had been standing still. What can you do?"</p>
               <p>"Provide suitable accommodations for the 'little girl,' of course."</p>
               <p>"Where?"</p>
               <p>"Not very far off, George," she answered, with her pleasant smile, and he saw that
                  the little girl was to find a home under his own roof, and a mother in the mother
                  of his little ones. He looked at her approvingly.</p>
               <p>"She will be more at home here," said the wife, "and then it will be a pleasure to
                  me to have her with me. She is a dear, good girl; how she loved our Mary! Poor
                  Helen, will be very lonely when her friend leaves her. Indeed, I do not know why
                  she should remain behind. She certainly is old enough to leave school, and I have
                  long felt that it was time for me to have my daughter with me. Do we agree?"</p>
               <p>"Always," he answered, as he imprinted a grave kiss upon her brow.</p>
               <p>"Then she shall return with Walsingham," said Mrs. Irving, joyfully; and her
                  husband, smiling assent, turned down the gravel-walk again.</p>
               <p>He looked back once or twice, and thought that his wife looked very handsome, and
                  very happy.</p>
               <p>"Bless her!" he ejaculated, "she's sunlight."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
               <head type="sub">RETURN.</head>
               <p>WHEN Mr. Walsingham landed in New York, his first care was to look after the young
                  ward, whose mental and moral culture he had for the last six years delegated to
                  others. Having arranged all those preliminaries, so well understood by those who
                  travel, so uninteresting in their details to those who do not, he proceeded at
                  once to Madame de Fleury's. On his way thither a thousand pleasing thoughts and
                  memories of the child attended him. All her graceful life flitted around him; much
                  of her possible future seemed before him. Absorbed in his own fancies, the great
                  tide of life coursing through the great city's artery swept by him unobserved. In
                  his mind the moving mass was blotted from the scene to give place to the
                  multiplied image of Viola. Little chubby-cheeked, frolicsome Violas seemed dancing
                  on the awning-posts, peering from behind the signs, or pirouetting on the
                  roof-combs of tall houses, like airy sprites. Pale-faced, demure Violas glided in
                  childish solemnity through the promenade, or looked with sweet, earnest eyes from
                  dim and distant windows. Seraphic-faced Violas, with crowns of golden curls,
                  smiled forth from the fleecy clouds and deep bright blue of Heaven. His thought
                  was filled with her, and from his thought the world was peopled. Let his eye fall
                  where it would, nought save her image filled it, and it almost seemed as if the
                  Universe presented but the ever-varying panorama of sweet child-life.</p>
               <p>Thus, and thus, he remembered her. Here she was arch and piquant—there she was
                  spirituelle—and ever, ever she was endearing. He would see her again soon, sweet
                  child, and he smiled on a pyramid of flounces, sailing past, surmounted by a
                  bonnet of pompadour pink, as he pictured her startled eyes wild with wonder, her
                  glad cry of recognition, her fond caress as she leaped to his arms and nestled on
                  his bosom. The rebuking frown from the passing pyramid was lost—so was the
                  house—(he had passed it some two squares back), and, ah! did he but know it, so
                  also was the <emph>child.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Retracing his steps, he soon found the ample door-plate which indicated the
                  residence of Madame De Fleury. He pulled the bell in his imperative way. The door
                  was opened by a very big and very black servant, familiarly known among the
                  demoiselles as "<hi rend="i"/>Sugar Plum," in allusion to the contraband trade
                  which he carried on in that staple for the mutual advantage of candy-loving
                  children and sweet-toothed "<hi rend="i"/>Sugar Plum" himself.</p>
               <p>Sugar Plum marshalled the visiter to the drawing-room with appropriate ceremonies,
                  where he was immediately joined by Madame de Fleury.</p>
               <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC5981-00000055"/>
               <p>Madame was surprised and delighted to see him—distressed to hear that he had had a
                  disagreeable voyage—charmed to find his sojourn abroad had been so
                  pleasant—afflicted beyond measure to learn that he proposed robbing her (yes,
                  robbing was the word) of that dear sweet girl whom she loved as a daughter—just as
                  she was improving so much in her music, too! After suffering these painful
                  alternations of feeling with a praiseworthy appearance of stoicism, she despatched
                  the grinning Sugar Plum for Miss Viola.</p>
               <p>Madame prided herself upon her conversational talent, and upon this occasion she
                  came out in all her strength. The presence of an intellectual and travelled
                  gentleman was an inspiration; and her finished sentences flowed musically forth,
                  ravishing her own ears at least. She had no reason to complain of her companion,
                  for his countenance wore the fixed, intent expression of an interested listener.
                  Such, indeed, he was; for his ear was strained to catch every distant sound that
                  might prelude the child's approach. The whispers of school girls in the corridor,
                  the distant singing in the musicroom, the quickly advancing or receding footsteps,
                  were all associated with her, and seemed to give token of her presence, as though
                  she alone inhabited the house.</p>
               <p>Do not think him, indulgent friends, more like a lover awaiting his mistress than
                  a guardian his child. Remember, the guardian is an ardent enthusiast—the child the
                  sole object of his manly tenderness. She is associated with all his plans for the
                  future, and has beguiled him into happiness in the past: could you listen
                  attentively to the elegant nothings of a stranger, when watching for the coming of
                  your long absent, darling daughter?</p>
               <p>Can that be she?</p>
               <p>It was a soft, measured tread that approached—unlike the bounding step of
                  Viola—and yet he listened, and turned his curious gaze toward the door. A tall,
                  picturesque girl, paused timidly at the threshold, and Madame's concluding remark
                  reverberated through his brain like sounding brass—</p>
               <p>"When we turn our backs upon our friends, we forget how time is dealing with
                  them."</p>
               <p>Yes! It <emph>was</emph> Viola!</p>
               <p>Her long curls hung about her face like a golden glory, as of old; her large, dark
                  eyes wore their well-remembered expression of mystic dreaminess; and her
                  complexion was transparently white, as that of a young child, and beautifully
                  suggestive of purity; one could not but believe an unspotted soul dwelt in such
                  glorious habitation.</p>
               <p>It was Viola, but she was not "<emph>the child.</emph>" Madame's last words still
                  echoed in his ears, and as though he had but just heard them, they struck upon his
                  brain with meaning.</p>
               <p>"We forget how time is dealing," etc.</p>
               <p>He had expected to find her a little grown, somewhat altered, but retaining her
                  simple, impulsive, loving ways—in short, her individuality—but this, why this was
                  a separate being! She had passed through the great transition, and was a woman—a
                  stranger. He marked the calm repose of her beautiful face, the modest dignity of
                  her attitude, and felt<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC5981-00000056"/> that his beloved
                     <emph>child</emph> was lost to him for ever. The sunny little one whose smiling
                  life had brightened his, had floated down the tide of time beyond recall.</p>
               <p>"Ah, my love, advance," cried Madame; "raise your eyes, and tell me if you ever
                  saw this gentleman?"</p>
               <p>One look, and her whole face was illuminated with the joy of recognition. With a
                  quick, glad, girlish cry, she bounded forward to throw herself upon his bosom, as
                  he had pictured. Poor Viola! she saw no change in <emph>him,</emph> she felt none
                  in herself.</p>
               <p>He took her hand, bent over it with stately courtesy, and led her to the sofa as
                  if she was a duchess. And this was the long-anticipated meeting!</p>
               <p>Poor Viola! The love which children, happy in domesticties, lavish upon parents
                  and sisters, she, in her lonely childhood, had concentrated upon Walsingham. The
                  peculiar affection and reverence which she had entertained in childhood for her
                  guardian, had strengthened with her developing energies and deepened with her
                  maturer life. Absence, that fatal corroder of affection, had only idealized hers;
                  and as the pictured pages of the past were opened to her youthful fancy, he was
                  measured with the hero, sage, and saint of ancient story, only to stand forth
                  greater, wiser, better than them all. Then, all that is charming in the memories
                  of childhood, all that is dear in the thought of <emph>home,</emph> was associated
                  with him; and she had longed for his return with the sick desire of an exile for
                  home—a child for its mother. The thought of him permeated her life, prompted every
                  effort, mingled with every action. <emph>He was all her loving nature had ever had
                     to love.</emph> What marvel that he was the centre round which her hopes,
                  thoughts, and affections revolved? And now he had come! He had taken her hand in
                  his, and bowed a formal bow, and handed her to the sofa, saying—Heaven knows what!
                  Something that whistled through her ears with a hollowness like the wind, and she
                  felt that the rich world in which she had hoped to revel was lost to her for ever,
                  even while her spirit had almost <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l rend="ti-1">"Caught the light upon her wings,</l>
                        <l>Through the half-opened portal glowing."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> As for Walsingham, he had been waiting to catch his sweet little girl to his
                  heart, but this unlooked for and beautiful impersonation of womanhood restrained
                  him. He swallowed his embarrassment, however, and proceeded, as best he might, to
                  cultivate an acquaintance.</p>
               <p>"I had not expected to find you so changed," he remarked, apologetically.</p>
               <p>Viola could not reply.</p>
               <p>The fluent Madame, who had never suffered from an impediment of speech, answered
                  with her usual fertility, "Changed, indeed! I doubt if you ever saw such a change
                  in your life. How tall she has become; and such a carriage! all my girls are
                  remarkable for their carriage. You see I have made quite an elegant affair of
                  her;" and she complacently surveyed Viola as the work of her own hands.</p>
               <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC5981-00000057"/>
               <p>"I hope you will be glad to return to the Eyrie," said Walsingham, making a second
                  effort.</p>
               <p>"Very glad," she answered, in a tone many removes from gladness.</p>
               <p>"Delighted, of course; but the young lady's interests must be consulted,"
                  interposed Madame, with a prudent regard for her own. "Although much improved, as
                  you remarked, she is by no means finished."</p>
               <p>"Miss Viola's will in the matter must be my law," said Walsingham, with a bow of
                  polite deference to his ward.</p>
               <p>"I was pleased to learn from your letters," he continued, "that your friend Helen
                  Irving was with you. Is she here still?"</p>
               <p>"Miss Irving is by no means as stylish as her friend," interposed Madame, with
                  broad significance; "but then she has not been under my care as long. Would you
                  not like to see her?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly!"</p>
               <p>Madame touched the bell, and despatched an attendant for Miss Irving. She came
                  presently, looking as unlike the interesting child he remembered as possible.
                  Walsingham thought, as she entered, that the race of fairies had departed, and the
                  world had attained its growth.</p>
               <p>"Miss Irving, Mr. Walsingham," announced Madame de Fleury.</p>
               <p>"Oh, is it possible!" exclaimed Helen; "what a delightful surprise!" and as he
                  took both her extended hands in his, she offered her lips girlishly to be
                  kissed.</p>
               <p>It seemed quite natural and right to receive this token of welcome from Helen, and
                  Walsingham spoke with such cheerful cordiality as he placed her on the sofa by her
                  friend, that Viola was ready to weep with vexation.</p>
               <p>Madame explained to her guest with her usual elegance of diction, that imperative
                  duties to her pupils compelled her to retire.</p>
               <p>"How glad I am to see you!" said Helen, when she had closed the door; "and looking
                  so like yourself! You have not changed in the least, except—"</p>
               <p>"Except? Pray let me have the exception," petitioned Walsingham, who, in common
                  with the wisest men, felt a little interest in the opinions of others when they
                  concerned himself.</p>
               <p>"Excuse me," said Helen, with reluctance; "but I think you look younger than you
                  used to do."</p>
               <p>"Ah, that is because you are overtaking me," said he, laughing. "I have been
                  reposing midway in the race of life, while you have been advancing so rapidly that
                  the distance between us has grown beautifully less. But how has time been dealing
                  with your charming mamma?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, she is charming mamma still," answered Helen, with loving enthusiasm, "and
                  time dare not meddle with her! Papa will tell you she is this moment, what he has
                  always believed her to be, the most beautiful woman in the world. In his eyes she
                  will flourish in immortal youth, though she should see an hundred summers."</p>
               <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC5981-00000058"/>
               <p>"Why not say winters, when speaking of such advanced age?"</p>
               <p>"Because, such a life as mamma's should be measured by summers only: it is so
                  bright, so warm, so abounding in blessed fruits."</p>
               <p>Walsingham observed her eyes moisten as she spoke, and taking her hand in his, old
                  fatherly way, said—"My sweet child, a few moments ago I would have reversed the
                  wheels of time, and carried you and Viola back to your beautiful childhood. I now
                  see that childhood was but a bright promise, of which your womanhood is the
                  fulfilment;" and he took Viola's hand also, who sat with downcast eyes,
                  mechanically tracing the figures in Madame de Fleury's carpet, and wondering why
                  that meeting, which had been for years a millennium in her hope, should have made
                  her so utterly miserable.</p>
               <p>At his kind touch she burst into tears.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, Madame in the school-room was conferring between classes with Signor
                  Bellini upon the events of the morning. "So handsome! so distingué!" she said, of
                  Walsingham. "I assure you, Signor, I have seen society in my own country, and know
                  a <emph>gentleman</emph> when I meet him by that free masonry which prevails among
                  well-bred people. You understand."</p>
               <p>Signor Bellini made some pretensions to being a well-bred man himself, and of
                  course understood perfectly. "Was mademoiselle pleased to meet her friend?" he
                  inquired, as he turned over the leaves of his grammar.</p>
               <p>"Not in the least, I assure you," replied Madame; "it is evident she regards him
                  with fear. Doubtless Monsieur Walsingham has been obliged to be stern with
                  mademoiselle, who is spirited. Ah, you may believe me, she is reluctant to
                  exchange the maternal care of Madame De Fleury for the iron rule of Monsieur
                  Walsingham."</p>
               <p>So satisfied was this excellent lady of the infallibility of her impressions, that
                  she ventured to confide them to Walsingham himself at his next visit.</p>
               <p>"If this be so," he replied, "I most assuredly shall not remove her. But permit me
                  to consult Miss Walsingham herself."</p>
               <p>Viola accordingly was summoned. A night's repose had restored her spirits, and she
                  entered, smiling and happy. Walsingham thought, as he bade her good-morning, that
                  he had never seen anything half so beautiful as her soft, brown eyes.</p>
               <p>"I wished, Viola," said he, kindly, drawing a chair near hers, "to consult you
                  with regard to yourself. It is my intention to spend the winter in the Eyrie,
                  where you shall be as welcome as the sunshine" (which it struck him that moment
                  she resembled), "if you choose to accompany me; but if you are so interested in
                  your studies, or companions here, that you will leave them with reluctance, or if
                  you would find this a more congenial home during the approaching winter, I will
                  relinquish the pleasure I had promised myself, and make such arrangements with
                  Madame De Fleury as will afford you the increased liberty suited to your
                  years."</p>
               <p>It was very considerate, but somewhat formal (she felt,<pb n="116-117"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000059"/> rather than thought), and manifested a total
                  misunderstanding of her wishes. She answered with some restraint, but evident
                  sincerity: "Take me home with you, if you please! I long to return to the
                  Eyrie."</p>
               <p>He was pleased, and inquired, "You are quite sure you would be happiest
                  there?"</p>
               <p>"I am very sure," she said, smiling, and then added, sadly, "I have never been
                  happy away from there."</p>
               <p>It sounded to him almost like a reproach, and there rose a recollection of the
                  morning when a little child he had borne her away. He remembered how her tearful
                  eyes were strained to catch a last glimpse of his mountain home, and how, when it
                  faded from the landscape, she sobbed herself to sleep, and—<emph>had never been
                     happy since!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>He longed to take her to his heart again, and tell her she should return to the
                  old Eden, and be his pet, his darling, his child, once more and for ever. But, lo!
                  she was not his <emph>child,</emph> but a <emph>woman,</emph> and her womanhood
                  awed him.</p>
               <p>Restraining the tenderness awakened for his whilome playfellow, he inquired if she
                  had been <emph>very</emph> unhappy?</p>
               <p>"Not exactly unhappy," she said, "and yet not happy. I felt so lonely, so unloved,
                  and I did so hunger for affection."</p>
               <p>"But you made friends after a time, and found yourself beloved?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, but I was not the <emph>best</emph> beloved of any. I was not necessary to
                  any. It was more tolerable, however, after Helen came, for she was a dear friend
                  from the dear home, and I lived some part of my old happiness over again with her.
                  Besides, I knew I was necessary to her, for I am sure she would have folded
                  herself within herself, like a sensitive plant, and quivered her shrinking life
                  out if I had not encompassed her about like her native air."</p>
               <p>Walsingham laughed.</p>
               <p>Her animated manner gave place to a look of perplexity, and, with a quick,
                  impatient movement, she brushed the curls back from her face, saying, as she did
                  so, "Why do you laugh, sir?"</p>
               <p>There was such infantile grace in the movement, such innocent naiveté in the
                  words, that Walsingham felt that she was his child again.</p>
               <p>"I can hardly tell why I laughed," said he, kindly, "unless it was at my little
                  girl's circumambient friendship, or perhaps at her idea of happiness."</p>
               <p>"To be necessary to some one?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. Do you remember, when a little child, how it constituted your greatest
                  happiness to believe you were more useful to me than Mrs. Grey herself? It is an
                  old fancy to which you are faithful."</p>
               <p>"What wisdom I displayed in my childhood!" she answered, laughing; "with the
                  experience of sixteen summers, I am not able to find a better idea of happiness.
                  To be so beloved by one as to be an actual necessity of life! That must be
                  blissful!"</p>
               <p>"But if you were so beloved and so necessary to one who was distasteful to you—"
                  suggested he.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Mr. Walsingham," cried Viola, quickly, "that could<pb n="118-119"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000060"/> not be! No one could be distasteful who regarded me
                  with affection. I always should give love for love."</p>
               <p>"Take care, monsieur, of the young gentlemen!" cried Madame De Fleury, who had
                  entered unobserved by one door.</p>
               <p>"I was not speaking of gentlemen," replied Miss Walsingham, decidedly, as she
                  retreated, blushing, through the other.</p>
               <p>Viola, in this interview, had presented such various phases, that Walsingham left
                  the house with a feeling of bewilderment. She was a child, and she was not. A
                  tone, a gesture, a flitting expression reminded him of the little Viola, and his
                  heart yearned toward her; then her beauty, her dignity, her grace, inherited from
                  her mother, recalled the lost Viola, and awakened bitter memories—and a third
                  phase of her character, belonging entirely to the present and herself, was at once
                  charming and novel. It occurred to the bachelor, as he sauntered down Broadway,
                  that there was something embarrassing in his guardianship of this young lady, but
                  he reconciled himself by remembering, firstly, that it was inevitable, and,
                  secondly, that the <emph>child</emph> had seemed a much more formidable
                  undertaking, but meeting the responsibility with a courageous heart all
                  difficulties had vanished. Thus it would be in this case, he promised himself, and
                  made the necessary arrangements for his homeward journey without any further
                  misgivings.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE JOURNEY.</head>
               <p>TRAVELLING dresses were purchased, trunks were packed, bills were paid, kisses
                  interchanged, promises made, all "the pomp and circumstance of glorious"
                  school-girl departure duly performed, and two bright young faces were turned
                  toward the Susquehanna.</p>
               <p>Viola's eyes danced with anticipation, and her little feet tattoed the floor of
                  the car as though she felt within her an impulse strong enough to accelerate the
                  locomotive.</p>
               <p>"Viola is wild with delight," said Helen to Walsingham.</p>
               <p>"Nay, then," retorted the wicked Viola, "if I am happiest of the two in returning,
                  it is not because I was the most miserable while away!"</p>
               <p>Helen blushed and was quiet: she evidently did not relish this meddling with her
                  misery past.</p>
               <p>Viola saw how the case stood with her sensitive friend, and added caressingly,
                  "Because I had not half as much to regret, you know."</p>
               <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC5981-00000061"/>
               <p>"No!" quoth Walsingham dryly, as he drew his cloak around him, "nothing but a
                  musty fusty guardian in a mountain rookery."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Viola, what a mistake you have made!" laughed Helen. "In your consideration
                  for me you forgot Mr. Walsingham!"</p>
               <p>But Viola was not to be vanquished by any guardian in the land, and argued him
                  into a good humor, and herself out of the little difficulty, with a tact worthy of
                  a daughter of Eve; and, alas! a daughter of some one else of whom he thought.</p>
               <p>Late in the afternoon our travellers reached the river. I say <emph>the</emph>
                  river, for to the young members of the party there was but one river, and their
                  homes were on its banks. The transit from car to boat was speedily made. With
                  feelings of quiet satisfaction they found themselves dreamily floating homeward,
                  encompassed by the shadows of familiar mountains. They were brilliant as a
                  bouquet, with autumnal tints, crimson and gold and green (the living green of
                  forest pines) mingled in luxuriant masses. The gorgeous range seemed to circle the
                  earth with a glory like the rainbow, while the haze of autumn hung its soft
                  illusion over the hills, subduing their brilliant hues. The flowing silvery-voiced
                  river murmured her primeval song to the mist-wreaths on her bosom, hurrying
                  downward to the sea; and from the dreamy beauty of hazy mountain top, and misty
                  river and picturesque landscape, arose a subtle influence which enthralled the
                  hearts of the travellers with a remembered charm. "Thus and thus it looked when we
                  were children, and thus it looks to-night around our home far away."</p>
               <p>Ay, thus it was before ye were, fair creatures; when no eye beheld its loveliness
                  save that of the All Seeing, who filled the universe with glories—thus will it
                  remain in its imperishable beauty, when ye, with your beloved, have passed away
                  and are no more seen for ever.</p>
               <p>Walsingham repeated the oft admired lines from Scott:— <q>
                     <l>"This is mine own, my native land."</l>
                  </q> And a rage for patriotic poetry ensued; from his student storehouse he drew
                  forth treasures of poesy, and amid the mingled harmonies of lofty numbers,
                  murmuring waters, and mysterious voices of the autumnal night, darkness settled
                  over the idyllian land.</p>
               <p>It was not in a sail-boat, spreading its white wings to the breeze, nor yet to the
                  plash of oars, and the song of "Row, brothers, row," that travellers ascended the
                  Susquehanna; neither was it by means of that slave of industry's lamp, the giant
                  steam, who pants and roars along less favoured waters. It must be confessed, and I
                  make the confession with humility, that it was in a simple canal-boat that
                  tourists condescended to traverse the valley of the Susquehanna.</p>
               <p>It is with still deeper abasement I confess that I have not a soul above
                  canal-boats! I am constrained to acknowledge a debt of gratitude to that ignoble
                  craft for never to be forgotten hours such as I have described, spent in the
                  companionship of<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC5981-00000062"/> those who have now
                  their homes amid the stars, excelling them in glory.</p>
               <p>There is a luxury in the sluggishness of these great mudturtles, an aristocratic
                  indifference to time, an appreciativeness of the "<foreign xml:lang="ITA">dolce
                     far niente,</foreign>" which soothes my flurried soul in these troublous days,
                  when the aforesaid slave of the lamp is becoming the master of the world. It is
                  refreshing to be ensconced upon the deck of this craft, and resign oneself to the
                  sweet influences of earth and air and sky throughout the ever changing day.
                  Sunshine and clouds, trees and mountains, are trinkets in Nature's kaleidoscope,
                  and Nature's child is never weary with watching their new and wonderful
                  combinations of beauty.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>Sleep,</emph> did you say? Hum—when it comes to that I have slept better on
                  a spring-mattress; but that is not travelling, you know. I do not remember to have
                  slept better in a stage-coach, or a railway car, or even over the boiler of the
                  steam giant itself.</p>
               <p>Young travellers, such as ours, to whom life is fresh, and the whole world novel,
                  are insensible to the discomforts of travelling. Viola and Helen thought it
                  capital fun to lie awake that night listening to the dances, songs, and witticisms
                  of the boatmen overhead. Nay, such is the contagion of mirth, that the two girls
                  found themselves gibing, jesting, and laughing quite as merrily, although not as
                  boisterously as their roystering <foreign xml:lang="FRA">compagnons du
                     voyage.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>"Uprose the golden morning," and uprose those merry maidens, eager to discover
                  what progress had been made during the night. The morning toilet over, they sought
                  the deck, where Walsingham was already promenading.</p>
               <p>"Do you see that?" said he, significantly, pointing to the prospect before
                  them.</p>
               <p>They looked and saw the three broad rivers, the three white bridges, the two
                  quaint villages, the beetling crag, the weather-stained turrets, in short, the
                  Eyrie home! How beautiful was it all in the morning sunshine!</p>
               <p>"Wal!" cried a sharp, twanging voice behind them, "if that aint a curus notion!
                  Did ever a fellow see the beat of that are house on the hill? Say, you!—What's the
                  name of that are place you was a pintin' at?"</p>
               <p>"It is called by the good people in the vicinity 'Walsingham's Folly,'" replied
                  the proprietor, courteously.</p>
               <p>The young ladies smiled, well remembering this opprobrious name given their
                  beloved Eyrie by the country folks.</p>
               <p>"Folly? Blamed if it aint!" said the querist, approvingly. "Maybe you can tell me,
                  stranger, what airthly use he meant to put it too?"</p>
               <p>"He intended to reside there."</p>
               <p>"And what did he follow, stranger?"</p>
               <p>"His own fancies, I believe."</p>
               <p>"True as preaching," exclaimed Jonathan, with a chuckle; "but what did he do for a
                  livin'?"</p>
               <p>"He was a gentleman of fortune."</p>
               <p>"Was he, though? Wonder how he made it?"</p>
               <p>"He inherited it."</p>
               <p>"Hay, now? Born with a silver spun in his mouth! eh!<pb n="124-125"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000063"/> Wal, you might ha' known he wa'n't what you might
                  call a practical man, or he'd never made that ere investment. Made a pretty
                  considerable hole in his pocket, I guess?"</p>
               <p>To this Walsingham assented, with an amused smile.</p>
               <p>"Broke him dead, I'll bet a cookie! Then what could he do? He couldn't keep store
                  up there, 'cause custom would be rayther slim—just rayther! 'Tisn't a good stand
                  for a tavern;—and there'd be mighty small chance of his persuadin' the great
                  central serpentine to take a turn his way. Bad investment!" And the practical man
                  shook his head, as though he felt the full extent of the stranger's calamity.</p>
               <p>"I'll tell ye what," he added, brightly, after a moment's cogitation; "wouldn't it
                  be a <emph>spe</emph>culation to advertise the view? Walsingham's Folly! Folly!
                  Folly! Folly!"</p>
               <p>He listened carefully as he thus rang the changes with his sharp metallic voice,
                  looking the while as though he was testing a doubtful coin. He must have felt so,
                  too, for he presently lifted his head, saying,</p>
               <p>"'Twon't pass!"</p>
               <p>"What? the name?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; 'taint out-setting enough for the <emph>spe</emph>culation. Folks can see
                  follys enough to hum. What do you say neow to the North American Pagoda?"</p>
               <p>Walsingham insinuated that this title, although very imposing, was not altogether
                  appropriate; and, feeling disposed to prolong a conversation that afforded so much
                  entertainment, turned on the indefatigable querist with the inquiry:—</p>
               <p>"Can you tell me, friend, why folks see so much folly at home?"</p>
               <p>"Because there are so many fools in the world, I guess."</p>
               <p>"I have been pleased to observe," said Walsingham, with a mixture of philosophy
                  and sarcasm, "the facility with which men denounce as folly whatever may be
                  foreign to their tastes. I recognise it as a wise provision of Nature, indulgent
                  mother! for the happiness of her children. It is comfortable, nay gratifying, to
                  feel satisfied of the wisdom of our own views, and the consequent folly of all who
                  dissent. Men differ in temperament and tastes, and are intolerant of those
                  differences. The spendthrift, not satisfied with his own prodigality, despises
                  those who do not share his fault. The miser does not confine himself to the mere
                  pleasure of hoarding, but takes a higher delight in his superiority over those who
                  are too short-sighted to follow his example. The bon-vivant admires himself as
                  prince of good fellows; while the Grahamite believes himself a Solomon for wisdom.
                  The poet,"—and he raised his eyes to the Blue Hill Bluff—"the poet revels in his
                  ideal world, with a feeling of contemptuous pity for the practical man, against
                  whom the fairy gates are closed; while <emph>he,</emph> in turn, regards his
                  imaginative brother as a brain-sick fool, unfit for the earnest purposes of life.
                  Each is intolerant of another's taste—each accuses his brother of folly."</p>
               <p>"Wal," said the stranger, who had listened attentively, "isn't there folly in the
                  whole bilin'?"</p>
               <p>"There is, I believe. We all have follies enough of our own to answer for, Heaven
                  knows, were they only as apparent<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC5981-00000064"/> to us
                  as those of our neighbours. But I fear our own faults are too near to meet the
                  angle of vision."</p>
               <p>"Sound as a dollar," quoth his admiring hearer, who spoke in the technicalities of
                  trade, as a sailor interlards his speech with nautical phrases; "you've been to
                  school, and had a right smart chance of learnin' a thing or two, I veow! You'd
                  never be the fool to build a folly; <emph>you</emph> wouldn't!"</p>
               <p>This tribute to his judgment was received by the guardian in silence, while his
                  loquacious companion proceeded to give a short account of himself; the object of
                  which was to show his own superior wisdom contrasted with "the folly of the fool
                  that built the folly."</p>
               <p>"Now, look at me!" quoth he, complacently; "me, Midas Mitten. I never had an
                  inheritance; I was born without a birthright, and began life upon a blessing,
                  which I invested in stocks. Never in anything so unproductive as
                     <emph>that,</emph> mind! I am a self-made man, sir!"</p>
               <p>Walsingham bowed, as the voluble Mr. Midas Mitten paused, signifying his approval
                  of the work.</p>
               <p>"By untiring <emph>in</emph>dustry and close equanomy I have piled up a leetle
                  fortune, sir; and when, after a hard day's bisness, I lay me down to sleep, it is
                  with the comfortable reflection that every mint-drop I own is working
                     <emph>while</emph> I sleep;" and he brought his hand down violently upon the
                  trunk on which he was seated, to attest his enthusiasm upon this subject.</p>
               <p>Fool! lulling his soul to rest on that poor thought!</p>
               <p>It was a hollow and sepulchral voice that slowly pronounced these words; all
                  turned in the direction of the voice, and saw a man standing within a few feet of
                  them, whose appearance was so remarkable that it deserves a passing
                  description.</p>
               <p>His figure was small and thin, his face dark, haggard, and partly hidden by a
                  crisp black beard flowing down to his bosom in patriarchal style; his head was
                  likewise guiltless of razor, and he stood erect in the bow of the boat, with long,
                  black, elfin locks floating backward in the morning wind, and deep, dreamy eyes
                  fixed upon distance, as though unconscious of the presence of those around.</p>
               <p>The little party had almost persuaded themselves that this rapt figure-head had
                  not spoken the sentence that startled them, when his lips moved, and the hollow
                  voice again issued from its grim portal; his eyes still fixed upon the distant
                  mountains, as though adjuring a glorious company invisible to ordinary ken, he
                  murmured,</p>
               <p>"What means this arrogant creation of God's hand, when he says, 'I am a self-made
                  man?' He means that he has heaped a little pile of shining dust together, without
                  which the sincere idolater would not believe himself to <emph>be</emph> a man.
                  Brother! my brother! does no voice of warning ever whisper to thy weary soul, 'It
                  is in vain ye rise up early, and so late take your rest, and eat the bread of
                  carefulness?' Does no denunciatory thunder startle the serenity of thy
                  self-complacent nature, with 'Thou fool! thy soul shall be required of thee?' Oh,
                  son of Adam! priding thyself in <emph>labour,</emph> remember thy progenitor was
                  doomed to <emph>labour</emph> by the <emph>curse</emph> of an<pb n="128-129"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000065"/> offended God; and when his daily penance of toil
                  was paid, he wiped the tears of tasked nature from his brow, and sat him down, in
                  the awful hope that he was nearer the terrible and mysterious gate of death which
                  was to admit him to the heaven, promised in pity, when Paradise was lost; could he
                  have beheld, in some vision of the night, his infatuated race glorying in their
                  inheritance of shame—exulting in their burdens, as idiot slaves might do in the
                  adornment of their shackles—ingeniously multiplying their labours, thereby
                  increasing their curse—forgetting, in their cares, the high story of their origin
                  and destiny, or recalling it, only with the vague remembrance accorded to classic
                  fable or heathen myth: then, then would he have realized with keener pang the
                     <emph>depth</emph> of the <emph>fall</emph>—the <emph>weight</emph> of the
                     <emph>curse.</emph>"</p>
               <p>He paused, and as he had before seemed to address an invisible and distant
                  company, he now stood in listening attitude, as if expecting a reply. Meanwhile
                  the rebuked Midas kept up an animated pantomime, expressive of intense amusement
                  and contempt, and was about to venture upon "<emph>Rich,</emph> ain't it, neow?"
                  when the enthusiast resumed:—</p>
               <p>"<emph>Labour</emph> is honourable: it is a duty appointed by God. Let it be
                  performed with humility, as the expiation of the sinful body.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Meditation</emph> is a remnant of Eden life. It is an exercise whereby the
                  soul grows great, and almost forgets her fall.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Poet Heart!" and he turned his gaze upon the Eyrie, "Oh, Poet Heart, it was
                  for this thou madest thy home amid the clouds. Labour may pant along these teeming
                  valleys, but thou, upon thy mountain top, mayest meditate. Lovest thou science?
                  There canst thou win the revelation of nature's secrets, and grasp the sublimest
                  mysteries of heaven! Art enamoured of poesy? There canst thou gather inspiration
                  from faintly echoing spirit-voices, and chant such melodies as may entrance the
                  world! <emph>This</emph> mayest thou do in thy <emph>Folly.</emph>"</p>
               <p>There was a sarcastic emphasis in this last sentence; and as his rapid utterance
                  died across the waters, the pines that crowned the summit of the bluff nodded as
                  though in answer to his adjuration.</p>
               <p>Midas Mitten's pantomime was resumed. He stuffed his bandanna in his mouth as
                  though to cork his cachinnations; he held his sides to indicate that his
                  fermenting merriment thus confined might burst his ribs asunder; and favoured
                  Walsingham with a significant punch, fraught with like peril to that courtly
                  gentleman; he shook his head violently to intimate he could not endure it much
                  longer; and wound up the performance by jerking his thumb over his shoulder toward
                  the object of these elegant attentions, and tapping his forehead, as he observed,
                  "Cracked, by hokey!"</p>
               <p>"I think," whispered Helen to Viola, "from the specimens before us, I shall like
                  crazy people better than sane ones."</p>
               <p>Just then the boat struck the wharf, and Helen observed that the stranger at the
                  bow turned slowly from the contemplation of the bluff, and fixing his regards upon
                  the steeples<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC5981-00000066"/> of the town, strode
                  abstractedly across the plank to shore. He did not tumble in the water as she
                  expected him to do, and she was speculating upon the probable care of his
                  invisible familiars, when the sharp voice of Mr. Mitten twanged on her
                  meditations.</p>
               <p>"Wal, mister, you hold up here; maybe you're to hum in this village?"</p>
               <p>A curt affirmative from Walsingham encouraged him to proceed.</p>
               <p>"I'm in luck to have a friend in the diggins, because I mean to stop myself.
                  There's a deal of water-power about, and I've a mind to see if it's available. A
                  saw-mill neow over yonder, across one branch to the Island"—</p>
               <p>Walsingham interrupted him, saying it was not in his power to afford him
                  information at present, as the ladies required his attention.</p>
               <p>"Never yeou mind, then," said Midas good-humouredly, "I'll be on hand. Where did
                  you say your folks live?"</p>
               <p>Walsingham turned once more, with Viola on his arm, and remarking, "There is my
                  home, sir," pointed to the Bluff.</p>
               <p>"Oh Je-rew-se-lem!" howled Mr. Midas Mitten as the little party left the wharf,
                  "I'm sold! He <emph>is</emph> the fool that built the Folly!"</p>
               <p>They had not proceeded many steps before they met Mr. Irving, who was on his way
                  to the wharf to receive them. He welcomed his daughter with affection, and her
                  friends with warmth, urging Walsingham to make his home with him until his own
                  house should be in readiness to receive them. Walsingham declined, having written
                  to engage quarters at the hotel, but Viola, of course, preferred becoming the
                  guest of her friend, and was consigned to the care of Mrs. Irving. It was settled,
                  however, that Mr. Walsingham should dine with them.</p>

               <head type="sub">TETE-A-TETE.</head>
               <p>"AND now, little lady, sit down by me, and tell me what you think of these
                  strangers. I don't feel as if I had ever seen one of the three before to-day."</p>
               <p>The day was over—the girls had smiled good-night—the house was still, and Mrs.
                  Irving drew her small chair to her husband's feet, prepared for a connubial
                  chat.</p>
               <p>"Not even Helen?" she inquired, smiling.</p>
               <p>"Not even Helen!" he echoed dolorously. "Do you know, little lady, you have a
                  grown-up daughter?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and not only that, she answered, her cheerful tones contrasting with his sad
                  ones, "I have a grown-up son, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>To stand on my right hand,</l>
                        <l>And keep the bridge with me."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"True! Howard must be nearly as tall as his father. I don't think I am quite as
                  well pleased as you are! It seems sad, darling, that our little pets should
                  outgrow our caresses."</p>
               <p>"They do not outgrow our love, you know; and is it not a proud reflection that you
                  have been permitted to give one noble man, one estimable woman to bless their
                  kind?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, if these children develop into such."</p>
               <p>"There it is!" she said quickly. "Your little child is an amusing puzzle—a
                  beautiful mystery—you long to unravel it—to know the end. Adolescence brings the
                  solution—you see the beautiful development of feelings, intellect, and principles,
                  and can almost read from your child's qualities its destiny. I felt all day, as I
                  looked into Helen's heart, that I could tell her fortune. When the dying patriarch
                  gathered his sons around him, and to each of all the listening twelve, spoke of
                  his character, his future, and his fate, there was much of the wisdom of the
                  discriminating parent mingled with his higher inspiration."</p>
               <p>"Poor little thing," he said, caressingly smoothing her brown hair, "I wonder if
                  you are growing old?"</p>
               <p>"Not in the least!" she exclaimed; "don't be so rude as to suggest such a
                  thing."</p>
               <p>"I never should have thought it but for these impertinent upstart children; but
                  now I look at you, I see you look to-night as you did twenty years ago."</p>
               <p>He took her face between his great hands and turned it up to meet his gaze, in
                  which there was more fondness than scrutiny. She had altered a little,
                  notwithstanding her husband's testimony. The freshness, the bloom, the rotundity
                  of youth, was gone; but hers was a prettiness with which time does not seriously
                  intermeddle. The delicate features, the soft<pb n="134-135"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000068"/> loving eyes, and, above all, the gentle winning
                  manner, were unaltered, and Mrs. Irving was a charming woman still. If she had
                  been ten times as old, and altogether ugly, I doubt if good George Irving would
                  have known it. The spells with which she had enchanted him in her lovely girlhood
                  were on his heart still, and, to his constant blind affection, she was—as she
                  always had been, and ever would be—his beautiful! his well beloved!</p>
               <p>"Your daughter is not pretty, Mrs. Irving," he remarked; his perceptions as a
                  father seemed clear enough.</p>
               <p>"What a disagreeable communication!" she exclaimed with playful pettishness. "Do
                  you know she is good?"</p>
               <p>"And sensible?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. Helen has native judgment, clear perceptions, and, alas! acute
                  sensibilities."</p>
               <p>Her husband smiled.</p>
               <p>"Your own gifts," he said. "Why did you not add"—he paused with a look of
                  admiration, as if he would say, "Why did you not add, your own beauty?"</p>
               <p>"Pshaw, George," she exclaimed, impatiently. "Although Helen is not a showy girl,
                  she is pretty enough. What a naughty father, to be dissatisfied with such a dear
                  child!"</p>
               <p>A mother's love is satisfied in her child; but a father's <emph>pride</emph>
                  claims some aliment. He would have his offspring distinguished by some
                  gift—conspicuous for some quality.</p>
               <p>"The truth is, Mary," he said, apologetically, "I did not think she was lacking in
                  beauty until her friend came down!"</p>
               <p>"Viola is dazzling!" said the mother; "but I shall not be able to love her, if she
                  eclipses my poor child in her father's eyes."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Irving had her womanly weaknesses. The husband smiled, and seemed pleased. I
                  think he loved her weaknesses rather better than anything else.</p>
               <p>"How your friend Walsingham has altered," he said, adroitly eluding the
                  difficulty.</p>
               <p>"Yes, has he not?"</p>
               <p>"He used to be so moping and silent—so pale and willowy."</p>
               <p>"And now," she answered, with vivacity, "his figure is firm, and strong as a
                  column; his cheek brown, and his whole countenance glows with energy! His
                  intellect, too, formerly so morbid, has grown, under the influences of active
                  life, healthy, vigorous, and clear. I used to feel interested in him, but now I
                  admire him!"</p>
               <p>Little lady, little, rattling lady! do you not see your husband frown? Do you not
                  know he is jealous of your praises?</p>
               <p>"It's late," said he, briefly.</p>
               <p>"Ah, yes! and you are tired—here are candles. As I was saying, he is so improved
                  by his travels, that we shall find him more companionable that ever."</p>
               <p>"Umph!"</p>
               <p>"Don't you think so, George?"</p>
               <p>"I think," said George, with an unpleasant emphasis, as he trimmed his candle,
                  "that he will not take his place among <emph>men</emph> until he has some object
                  upon which to expend his energies—until he takes some interest in the serious
                  concerns of<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC5981-00000069"/> life. Of a parlour fixture,
                  prating of music, painting, poetry, and such trifles, as though they made up the
                  sum of existence, you women are the best judges;" and he strode through the hall
                  and up the staircase as though he crushed a swarm of irritating insects at every
                  tread.</p>
               <p>His wife tripped lightly after him, with a coquettish smile lighting her small
                  features.</p>
               <p>So be it unto all monsters who insinuate that their wives are old, or their
                  children ugly!</p>

               <p>VIOLA had seemed so eager to visit the Eyrie, that Walsingham invited her to ride
                  thither with him on the following morning. As he led her to her horse he was again
                  struck by the beauty of her face, refreshed as it was by rest, and bright with
                  expectation.</p>
               <p>He did not yet identify this lovely girl with his little lost pet. He had not
                  associated familiarly with women for years; and, therefore, his manner, though
                  courtly and deferential, was distant. She also was reserved; her quick affections
                     still<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC5981-00000070"/> suffering from their
                  revulsion; and so they rode silently through the grass grown streets.</p>
               <p>When on the bridge, with the calm waters beneath them, mirroring mountain and sky,
                  as she had loved to see it long ago, she turned to him quickly, saying,</p>
               <p>"Does not this recall the past to you?"</p>
               <p>As he looked down upon her fair young face, almost infantile in its beauty, he
                  answered, "The past? Yes, to me it does; but you!—<emph>you</emph> have no
                  past."</p>
               <p>She looked at him expressively, as though about to speak, and he waited to hear,
                  feeling that her reply would be a vindication of her little past. Her courage
                  failed, however, and she averted her face timidly.</p>
               <p>"Viola," he said, recalling her to himself and the subject, "I would like to know
                  how far into the past your recollections extend."</p>
               <p>"About fourteen years," she answered, gravely.</p>
               <p>Walsingham laughed as much at the manner as the answer. "That is nearly the whole
                  of your short life," said he. "Can you remember since you were two years old?"</p>
               <p>"I have not any connected remembrance of life at that age, but there are certain
                  scenes witnessed then which are as vivid pictures in my mind; from the time I was
                  four years old memory furnishes me with a connected history of my
                  experiences."</p>
               <p>"Your memory may be faithful enough, but are you not mistaken with regard to time?
                  I can scarcely think you remember things that transpired when you were so
                  young."</p>
               <p>"I am not mistaken; I remember my—" She paused; then resumed in a lower tone; "my
                  father's face, and I never saw him after I was two years old."</p>
               <p>She had never before spoken of her father, and Walsingham had thought that her
                  early experiences were lost in the oblivion of childhood. Curious to know what her
                  impressions of that parent were, he inquired, "How do you remember him?"</p>
               <p>"I see him always by a dim fire-light, his cloak and hat covered with snow, as
                  though he had just entered from a storm; he stands erect, gesticulates violently,
                  and wears a dark and threatening aspect."</p>
               <p>"I would not like to be thus remembered by a daughter" said Walsingham. "Tell me,
                  Viola, does your heart ever yearn toward your remaining parent?"</p>
               <p>"Never! He must have terrified me when a child, for I think of him with
                  dread."</p>
               <p>"You need not fear him while I am your protector," said Walsingham,
                  soothingly.</p>
               <p>Viola resumed: "Do you know that the strange enthusiast, whom we saw yesterday,
                  recalled to my mind its image of my father?"</p>
               <p>"Did he resemble him?"</p>
               <p>"No; yet he <emph>reminded</emph> me of him. I think my father must have been
                  large and powerful—this man was wasted and frail. My father was fierce and
                  wrathful—the stranger calm and contemplative; yet when I saw one, I thought of the
                  other."</p>
               <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC5981-00000071"/>
               <p>"The stranger was a mysterious-looking man, and your father has been enveloped in
                  mystery—that was the association."</p>
               <p>"But I would like to know if he still lives, and why he neglects his daughter, and
                  also—(her voice fell here)—what claim that daughter has upon Mr. Walsingham's
                  kindness."</p>
               <p>Walsingham answered quietly, "I never knew your father, Viola, but I fear he was
                  not worthy of the child, Heaven gave him. Your mother was a cousin, whom I loved.
                  She was not happy in her wedded life, and when she died I adopted her little
                  daughter in my heart. Does she receive me in her father's stead?"</p>
               <p>With a grateful girlish impulse she caught his hand, and pressed it to her
                  lips.</p>
               <p>The flush deepened on his brow. "Not so," he said, "you were to me a benefaction.
                  I should not be the man I am today but for your influence."</p>
               <p>She looked inquiringly.</p>
               <p>"Under the influence of an early grief my mind had grown morbid and diseased; you,
                  then a little child, were its physician."</p>
               <p>"Oh, see!" said Viola, "there is the very hollow oak in which Uncle Captain caught
                  my gray squirrel, and here, the honeysuckles were so abundant—oh, every step is
                  full of remembrance!" and as they rode onward the excited girl poured out the
                  fullness of her innocent heart to him.</p>
               <p>"And here," said Walsingham, "is the Eyrie. The wilderness has reclaimed its
                  own."</p>
               <p>It had, indeed! A growth of wild underbrush filled up the garden, the very paths
                  of which were effaced by the rankness of vegetation; the porches were green with
                  moss and mould; the windows shattered; the walls weatherstained and foul.</p>
               <p>"Where are Mrs. Grey, and Cuff, and Chloe, and the birds, and chickens?" cried
                  Viola.</p>
               <p>"The birds remain," said Walsingham.</p>
               <p>"No, these are a wild race of savages. Where are the familiar little cat-birds who
                  used to peer into my eyes, and tell me things? Where are the pigeons that would
                  come at Uncle Captain's call?"</p>
               <p>"All these we can restore, but never the years I wasted here. I was a Rip Van
                  Winkle, sleeping away my youth."</p>
               <p>Walsingham felt strangely impelled to confide in this companionable girl, who had
                  opened her young heart to him.</p>
               <p>"You said you met with a misfortune in early life which crushed your energies.
                  Tell me more."</p>
               <p>"I buried myself in these solitudes, and became a melancholy dreamer—an idealist—a
                  hermit living in visions of the past, while the precious present was ever
                  dissolving, and <emph>gone.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"It was a sad waste," said he, "but it shall be retrieved. Here, on this very
                  spot, where I sank, entranced, shall my aroused energies redeem the past. Where I
                  once dreamed will I now labour."</p>
               <p>As he continued to walk amid the desolations which time had gathered around his
                  home, he felt no longer isolated from<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC5981-00000072"/>
                  his kind, as formerly, but knew himself to be one of a striving, struggling,
                  suffering race; he belonged to the great human family, and for that family he
                  would labour in love. He thought of the travellers of yesterday—the one ignorant
                  and vulgar, the other brainsick—and found something to imitate in both. Like the
                  enthusiast, he would gaze through space upon the distant and intangible truths of
                  nature, and, like Midas Mitten, he would reduce them to practical uses. He would
                  study, he would ponder, he would compile, and the great human brotherhood should
                  enjoy the fruit. The marvels of science should not merely excite the wonder of
                  gaping men, but should minister to their daily necessities. His school-craft
                  should teach men better handicraft. His knowledge should be a working
                  knowledge.</p>
               <p>He who once despised mankind had "unlearned contempt." With the humility of
                  enlarged wisdom he recognised in all men <emph>brothers</emph> and equals. Equals
                  in their rights, their aspirations, their wants and <emph>weaknesses</emph>—equals
                  in the eye of God. Of this increased respect for his race was born that desire for
                  the esteem of men which is ambition; and he thought, with a glow of pleasure
                  flushing his pale face, that his name might remain a beacon, to the earnest and
                  inquiring, when he should have passed away. <q>
                     <l>"I am a man and have desires within me,"</l>
                  </q> he repeated, as with one more survey of his crazy dwelling he turned away,
                  full of plans for the future, full of the business of life, full of its earnest
                  concerns as George Irving himself would desire.</p>
               <p>"I will make it blossom like the rose," he said to Viola, as they rode homeward.
                  "The house shall be repaired and placed at your disposal. My study will make a
                  charming boudoir for you. I shall build a sanctum for myself on the edge of the
                  precipice—I like a leaning tower—to which I shall invoke "spirits from the vasty
                  deep." Mrs. Grey will return with a retinue of pets, and I will cultivate a dove
                  cote, and devote myself to the taming of cat-birds: will that do?"</p>
               <p>How reserve had melted, and what good friends they had become during that mountain
                  ride! <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"As she fled fast through sun and shade,</l>
                        <l>The happy winds upon her played,</l>
                        <l>Parting the ringlet from the braid:</l>
                        <l>She looked so lovely as she swayed</l>
                        <l>The rein with dainty finger tips."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>They visited Mrs. Grey before returning, much to that good woman's delight. They
                  found her on a bench under an apple tree sewing, with the old kitchen clock by her
                  side, clicking with unabated zeal.</p>
               <p>"I told you they'd be sure to come home some day," she remarked triumphantly to
                  that mute friend.</p>
               <p>"And where are my old playfellows, Cuff and Chloe?" inquired Viola.</p>
               <p>"Dear heart! do you remember the poor creeturs? They both died for me; and then I
                  took Jim. People <emph>do</emph> say Jim<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC5981-00000073"
                  /> will never die—I'm sure I hope not—but where is he? Jim! Jim!"</p>
               <p>Jim, a solemn and sententious crow, as black as his predecessors, came hopping on
                  one foot, and examined his new acquaintances with imperturbable gravity.</p>
               <p>Viola laughed and clapped her hands like a child.</p>
               <p>"We shall be great friends, most grave and reverend seignior."</p>
               <p>That evening when the girls played a duet together, and the pretty mother sat
                  sewing and listening to Walsingham, George Irving peered over his newspaper and
                  wondered if she did not think her liege lord a dullard, compared with that
                  brilliant gentleman.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
               <head type="sub">HOME.</head>
               <p>WALSINGHAM found that the season was already too advanced to admit of building,
                  and the projected study was reluctantly deferred until the summer. The dwelling,
                  however, was thoroughly repaired, and by Christmas he had taken possession.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Grey had convoyed the furniture to the top of the bluff herself; and with the
                  clock under one arm, and the Bible under the other, was the first to enter the
                  renovated dwelling. "They're lucky things to head a moving with, and may save you
                  time and eternity, Jim."</p>
               <p>Jim dropped his eyelids sanctimoniously. He had so long a lease of time that he
                  felt rather indifferent to eternity, but it would not be decorous to show it. So
                  the precious black hypocrite hopped after his mistress, with the air of an elder,
                  and spent the day in watching for something upon which he could lay his pilfering
                  claw.</p>
               <p>Viola's delight on returning to her old home was a puzzle to Walsingham. His own
                  associations with the place were sombre,<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC5981-00000074"
                  /> and he used to think with compassion of her, as a fair child whose life had
                  been subdued and overshadowed in his joyless home. So little did he comprehend the
                  beautiful mystery of an imaginative childhood. She had not lived in
                     <emph>his</emph> sad world, but in a rich and glowing realm of her own
                  creation. There had been an ever gushing fountain of joy in her young heart; an
                  unextinguishable inner light which illumined all without. She had been a quiet
                  child, not because she was a sad one, but because she was alone, and it is only in
                  couples that children grow noisy; but she had been happier than the veriest romp
                  that takes her daily fill of boisterous sport. Nay, her dreamy contemplative
                  happiness possessed more substance; it could be carried into the future for memory
                  to feast upon.</p>
               <p>She had loved, when at her desk, to close her eyes upon wearisome books, and
                  recall the delicious sensations of her unfettered life; through all the harsh
                  restraints and irksome tasks of school, her fancy revelled in the freedom of the
                  Eyrie; it was remembered as an enchanted palace, in which care or sorrow dared not
                  intrude: this was <emph>her</emph> little past.</p>
               <p>It is astonishing what a respect we all have for our childhood! We regard it with
                  admiring pride, as a beautiful romance of which we were the hero; a fairy life
                  from which, alas! we have been disenchanted. We reverence it as something better
                  than ourselves—and so it is! Why is it, then, that we are so impatient toward
                  childhood, when this beautiful, better life, which has passed from us, is
                  transferred to the children around us? Why do we seek to make them wise, and
                  polite, and mannish like ourselves? Why do we embitter their little joys, and
                  shatter their bright illusions with maxims and reproof, against which our own
                  youth, our better self, would have rebelled?</p>
               <p>You do not get along very well with your children, for John is so noisy, and Ben
                  so mischievous, and Sallie so stupid! Dive through the flood of time that
                  separates you from your own early experiences; ponder them as a book, and they may
                  aid you to unravel this. You may find that John's noise, so harsh and hideous, was
                  not always noise to you, as it is not to him. It is music! the music of the
                  spheres! Poor fellow, let him enjoy it! A few years more, and it will cease to
                  echo in his soul as it has done long since in yours! Ben does not break, and tear,
                  and tangle with malice prepense, and is no more responsible for damage done, than
                  a bull in a china shop, or any other young animal following its natural instincts
                  amid the artificial restraints of life. Do not fill his loving, happy, awkward
                  heart with distress for offences never intended and hardly understood. When he
                  grows older he will appreciate at their cost the precious adornments of life.</p>
               <p>And Sally! sweet, stupid Sally, so full of her own fancies that she will not
                  comprehend your teachings; why should she understand you? You do not half
                  understand her.</p>
               <p>These vagrants have led me a chase! Where were we? Oh, in the Eyrie, expounding
                  Viola's regard for the same. Such and such were Viola's feelings towards that
                  peaceful home; and what were the guardian's feelings towards Viola? He did not
                  attempt to define them himself, and we can hardly do so for him.</p>
               <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC5981-00000075"/>
               <p>The difference in their respective ages caused him to regard her as somewhat of a
                  child still. He grew well acquainted with her young ladyship in the long winter
                  evenings, and found she concentrated in herself the qualities of two beings who
                  had exercised a powerful influence for good or evil over his heart—her child self,
                  and her lost mother; and he loved her for the sake of both. He loved her as
                  world-worn men love that which is brighter, purer, better than themselves; as
                  fathers love their gentle daughters. A daughter seemed she to him—the lost Viola's
                  daughter and his own! The Viola who had won his early love, passed hence like a
                  vision and left this glorious legacy to him.</p>
               <p>There was that in the character of Viola which belonged purely to her present
                  self, and had no connexion with her childhood, or her mother. Her intellect was
                  stronger, and her nature more earnest. Walsingham felt that life in the Eyrie was
                  not solitary now, for there was beautiful companionship in the quick appreciative
                  mind ever ready to comprehend and respond to his own. Life in the Eyrie was no
                  longer solitary for another reason. The Irvings came often to visit their fair
                  friend, sometimes to dine, sometimes to tea, sometimes to spend a few days. The
                  village people, too, called with country hospitality and invitations, and these
                  civilities were reciprocated by Viola. Music, and dancing, and laughter became
                  familiar to those old walls; and often, after a merry winter evening had passed,
                  would a well-filled sledge glide from the door, over the smooth snow and down the
                  moonlit mountain road, to the music of tinkling bells and glad young voices Oh, I
                  remember! Such glorious visiting!</p>
               <p>Thus passed the winter quickly, and the spring came—the snow vanished, the
                  mountain road became impassable, and then—why then there were books to read, songs
                  to sing, and nameless household duties to be performed, with a mysterious
                  assumption of womanly dignity; for Viola was not <q>

               <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
               <head type="sub">AN ARRIVAL.</head>
               <p>ONE misty March morning, Viola stood at the drawing-room window, gazing out upon
                  the sea of fog that encompassed the mountain, and counting the days since she had
                  seen Helen, when Walsingham passed the window. He was equipped for driving; seeing
                  her bright face at the window, he threw up the sash, saying,</p>
               <p>"The sky is leaden enough, but I can promise you sunshine before the day
                  closes."</p>
               <p>"I fear I shall not value it," she answered; "for I love these warm moist spring
                  mornings; they are delicious after the winter's cold."</p>
               <p>"Come out and enjoy this—it is so soft and mild—the very birds are rejoicing."</p>
               <p>She smiled assent, and quickly joined him on the piazza. A soft south wind played
                  with her flowing curls, while in the naked tree-tops the blue-birds twittered to
                  each other, announcing the spring.</p>
               <p>"Hark," said she, as she listened; "the time of the singing of birds is come!"</p>
               <p>"You can enjoy these voices of spring, while I must essay the execrable spring
                  roads. Pity me, for I must drive down the mountain this morning."</p>
               <p>"I pity you so much," she answered, with her merry laugh, "that I shall share the
                  discomfort with you."</p>
               <p>"You will find the drive villanous!"</p>
               <p>"N'importe! it is short, and I would like so much to go."</p>
               <p>"For my sake, or for Helen's?" he inquired.</p>
               <p>"What an inquisitive guardian!" she said. "I must examine my heart and confess: I
                  want to go partly for the sake of a tête-à-tête with you, partly for the sake of
                  surprising Helen, and partly to feel the fresh south wind, and hear the singing
                  blue-birds."</p>
               <p>"Honestly confessed; and because I have been included in the category, you shall
                  come."</p>
               <p>And jolting, splashing, down the mountain road they came, to Mrs. Irving's door,
                  where they met with a surprised welcome, the family believing the road to be
                  impassable.</p>
               <p>"I am <emph>so</emph> glad you are come," said Helen, embracing her friend; "for I
                  have such news! What do you think of seeing Howard?"</p>
               <p>"I think I should not know him without an introduction."</p>
               <p>"Oh, true; you have not seen him since he was a boy," said Helen, looking a little
                  disappointed by the cool reception her friend gave to "such news."</p>
               <p>"Well, he will be home this summer to spend his vacation,<pb n="152-153"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000077"/> and will bring with him his friend, of whom you
                  have heard me speak. Cola is his name—Cola Conway—do you think it pretty? Howard
                  fills his letters with its euphonious syllables. If he were to write half as much
                  about a lady, I should set my heart in order to receive a sister before long."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps he expects you to set your heart in order to receive a lover in this Cola
                  Conway."</p>
               <p>Helen flushed slightly, while her friend continued:</p>
               <p>"How delighted I shall be to see Howard again! I remember him as a very vehement
                  boy, with black eyes and sunbrowned face, of whom I was half fond, half afraid.
                  When Howard played with us I felt as though we stood on a volcano."</p>
               <p>"Poor fellow! He used to be so explosive," laughed Helen; "and you were so timid,
                  too. No doubt his temper is still violent, but he has learned self-control; and
                  then he has grown so handsome! Last vacation, when I was home, I admired him more
                  than any young gentleman I had ever seen, which was unfortunate, considering he
                  was my brother, was it not?"</p>
               <p>"It was very natural," responded her friend, "because you love him. I think Mr.
                  Walsingham the handsomest man I ever saw."</p>
               <p>One bright summer morning, when Viola was among her roses, Walsingham sought her
                  with news. The long-expected guests had arrived.</p>
               <p>He had learned this while in the village, and immediately called at Mr. Irving's;
                  had had half an hour's conversation with the young gentlemen, and invited them to
                  dine with him the following day.</p>
               <p>"How extremely prompt you have been in your civilities!" she said, looking
                  gratified.</p>
               <p>"Solely on your account," he answered. "I feared lest you would call upon them
                  also."</p>
               <p>"I am afraid I should," she said, laughing, "and thank you for your consideration.
                  Is Howard very handsome?"</p>
               <p>"I do not know," said Walsingham, with a slight tincture of that dignified
                  superciliousness, which you may have observed in men when the personal appearance
                  of another is discussed. They are so sceptical upon the subject of manly beauty,
                  unless, indeed—but, no matter!—"I do not know—I think not."</p>
               <p>"Helen told me he was remarkably so."</p>
               <p>"A partial sister must be a partial judge," he answered, with more gravity than
                  was usual to him when addressing her. It is possible that he felt concerned to
                  find her interested in the good looks of young gentlemen. Be this as it may, she
                  instinctively felt that it was best to forbear further questioning.</p>
               <p>The next day she decided this important point to her satisfaction, without his
                  aid. Howard was certainly handsome. He was tall, well-knit, and firm in figure,
                  like his father; and, when fully matured, would, doubtless, be a powerful man. His
                  features were regular and well-formed, but large, partaking of the massiveness of
                  his frame. His carriage was dignified<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC5981-00000078"/>
                  fied and manly, and his whole appearance noble. The repose of his manner she
                  thought hardly natural, contrasting, as it did, with his well-remembered boyish
                  impetuosity. This mastery over self was indeed an acquired grace; acquired by
                  indomitable resolution, and maintained only by constant watchfulness. His dark eye
                  was true to his strong nature, and, scorning restraint, flashed with the olden
                  fire.</p>
               <p>Friends often present fine contrasts, so prone are men to assimilate with their
                  antipodes. Mr. Conway was light, elegant, and graceful, reminding one of the
                  troubadour or page of chivalric story. A very Apollo, as his friend was a
                  Hercules. He sparkled with bon-mots, was ready at impromptus, sketched with
                  facility, played to his own satisfaction, with a versatility that made him the
                  envy of less accomplished youths. There was an open, frank expression in his face,
                  which at once prepossessed the beholder; and it is hardly necessary to add, after
                  this enumeration of his accomplishments, that he was a favourite with the
                  ladies.</p>
               <p>He sat at Viola's left hand at dinner, with Helen vis-a-vis, where he shone with
                  more than usual brilliancy, feeling quite at home with the friends of his friend.
                  Viola thought him very amusing, while Helen rendered the highest tribute to his
                  powers, in believing him worthy of Howard's praises.</p>
               <p>"Look at that man, Conway," said Howard, after they had sought the drawing-room.
                  "Look at Walsingham; for you have never looked upon his like before! All my life
                  he has exercised an unconscious influence over me. He was the sphynx of my
                  meditative boyhood, solemn, silent, mysterious, and grand! The sphynx speaks now,
                  and its revelations are sublime."</p>
               <p>"He's a glorious old fellow!—may he outlive his stony prototype. And did you
                  reverence the young lady, too?"</p>
               <p>"The young lady was a timid child, over whom I tyrannized most royally!"</p>
               <p>"May she never forgive you for the same!"</p>
               <p>"Spoken with the malice of a friend!"</p>
               <p>"I intend making a favourable impression," said Conway, with arch coxcombry, "and
                  would have such a formidable rival out of the way. How would I come out in a race
                  with Leviathan?"</p>
               <p>"As the antelope, when measuring speed with the elephant."</p>
               <p>"Where do you find the fable?"</p>
               <p>"Nowhere. I intend writing it when I see which will win."</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Eh bien,</foreign> Mr. Elephant, I have the start of you
                  already, for see! Mr. Walsingham comes from the piano to invite me to sing."</p>
               <p>"More likely to reprove you for chattering like a monkey while the ladies were
                  singing!"</p>
               <p>Conway's surmise was correct. Walsingham was commissioned by the ladies to desire
                  a song from him. He obeyed with cheerful alacrity, and in a full rich manly voice
                  sang Moore's exquisite lines, <q>
                     <l>"Fly to the deserts, fly with me."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC5981-00000079"/>
               <p>"How beautiful," whispered Viola to her guardian, "to wed the rich fancies of the
                  poet to such melody!"</p>
               <p>And now the music changed, and, after a prelude, solemn and sad, Conway sang an
                  evening hymn. The song was extremely beautiful, and the hushed little party
                  listened to its mournful cadences in silence.</p>
               <p>Walsingham's eyes, as usual, rested on Viola's face, when suddenly she threw her
                  hands toward the singer, with a faint cry, and bursting into tears, hid her face
                  in Mrs. Irving's bosom.</p>
               <p>Walsingham was by her side instantly, distressed and alarmed.</p>
               <p>As she lay sobbing in Mrs. Irving's arms, he lifted the curls that hid her hot
                  face from his tender scrutiny, saying, "My poor little Viola, what has befallen
                  you?"</p>
               <p>"Do not tease her," said Mrs. Irving, impatiently pushing him away. "You men must
                  always probe a wound! It is only excitement and nervousness. Let her cry—it will
                  do her good."</p>
               <p>Walsingham had not seen Viola weep since her childhood. He had no faith in
                  excitability or nervousness, or any of those slight excuses which females make for
                  violent demonstrations, neither did he perceive how this agitation could be of
                  advantage to Viola. He was convinced that something had shocked and distressed
                  her. Sorrow had reached her in his very presence, and he must—he would—know what
                  had moved his bright joyous darling to tears.</p>
               <p>"If she is in grief her friends must know the cause, that they may comfort her,"
                  he remarked to Mrs. Irving.</p>
               <p>"Do not magnify a trifle," answered that lady. "She was touched by the music, I
                  suppose."</p>
               <p>Viola, grateful for his anxiety, hastened to relieve it. Controlling her emotion,
                  she lifted her flushed face, and placing a little hand in his, whispered, "I have
                  been too foolish, but will tell you why by and by."</p>
               <p>When the guests had departed, and Helen, who remained with her friend, retired,
                  Viola stole to Walsingham's study. He rose with a smile of welcome as she entered,
                  and placed a chair for her.</p>
               <p>"I am almost ashamed to come to you after my folly of today," she began, blushing,
                  "but I could not sleep until I had begged your indulgence."</p>
               <p>"I am glad you are come. I should not have slept either, had I been left to
                  conjecture the cause of your distress."</p>
               <p>"You embarrass me when you apply so great a word to a trifle. I was only shocked
                  by the operations of my own mind. The whole thing is so confused and vague I
                  hardly know how to explain it to you.</p>
               <p>"When Mr. Conway began to sing, the music struck some pleasant chord in momory. It
                  seemed as if I had been often lulled to sleep by those sweet sounds, and I
                  abandoned myself dreamily to their influence. Suddenly I began to question where I
                  could have heard them before, and at last a vivid remembrance flashed upon me,
                  like a picture, of a dying fire-light—a poor dark room—a lady, sad, tender, and
                     beautiful,<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC5981-00000080"/> with a dreamy child upon
                  her bosom, and around all, like an atmosphere, this music floated." Here her voice
                  trembled and failed, but, with a final effort, she added,—"Then I knew I heard
                  again the hymn my lost mother used to sing to her poor child."</p>
               <p>"Poor child! poor child!" he echoed, smoothing her soft hair.</p>
               <p>This was the second time she had named her mother. It had seemed to be a subject
                  too sacred for words, and he was touched by her confidence as well as by her
                  emotion.</p>
               <p>"Do not pity me," she said, looking up with her brightest smile, "I am very, very
                  happy now. It was for the sorrows of the poor little bereaved one that I wept. She
                  seems like a child that I knew and loved, and pitied, long ago. I hardly identify
                  her with my happy self."</p>
               <p>"Bless you!" said Walsingham fervently.</p>
               <p>"Viola, it is the desire of my life to see you happy, and I am almost grateful to
                  you for being so, and now good-night, my"—</p>
               <p>She paused, and looked him in the face, as though to inquire what he would have
                  added, but had suppressed.</p>
               <p>"Good-night, my little girl."</p>

               <p>HELEN remained all night with her friend, and the next morning the gentlemen
                  called to inquire after Miss Walsingham's health, and take Miss Irving home. They
                  found Viola quite herself again, and bewitchingly beautiful; at least so thought
                  Howard, who, seating himself near her, endeavoured to engross her attention, while
                  Helen obligingly entertained his friend. Viola was not sorry to have a few
                  moments' conversation with him, as her curiosity had not been appeased by the
                  slender opportunities of yesterday. He conversed with tact and originality, and
                  she thought that, if not as brilliant as his friend, he was infinitely more
                  interesting—she liked his earnestness.</p>
               <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC5981-00000081"/>
               <p>Mr. Conway, meanwhile, seemed much interested in Howard's sister, and excited his
                  multiform powers for her entertainment; while Helen, who was never ungrateful for
                  any effort made in her behalf, looked so amiably appreciative that he could not
                  help admiring her while he talked.</p>
               <p>Helen, although not strictly beautiful, was an attractive girl. Her excellent
                  understanding, and no less excellent heart, her fine feminine character so shone
                  forth in all she did, that one felt sympathetically attracted by the subtle
                  influence of her quiet gifts. She was extremely timid in the presence of
                  strangers, and blushed on the slightest provocation. As she listened to the
                  sparkling Conway her colour would come and go, flit and fade with the beautiful
                  variability of the northern light. This was the only betrayer of her bashfulness,
                  so thoroughly was it subjected to her breeding. Never was she so overcome by
                  constitutional shyness as to forget what was due to society and to herself.</p>
               <p>"I am glad you are pleased with the natural scenery around us," she said, in reply
                  to his repeated admiration; "it is not only beautiful, but abounds in Indian
                  legends and historical incidents. When you become familiar with its points of
                  local interest, it will be haunted ground to you."</p>
               <p>"The country seems hardly old enough for that," said Conway, who, like all
                  students, had great veneration for antiquity.</p>
               <p>"It is true," replied Helen; "its known history does not extend much farther back
                  than the memory of the oldest inhabitant. There are men living who remember when
                  all this cultivated country was a primeval wilderness, and the hunting-ground of
                  the Shawnees and Mohicans lay in the rich valley of the Susquehanna. But where it
                  loses in antiquity it gains in interest; for the appalling facts of history are
                  never so forcibly realized as when received from the lips of actual
                  participators."</p>
               <p>"But," answered Conway with animation, "should not the narrative be received with
                  distrust because of the excited feelings and personal prejudices of the narrator?
                  Your old inhabitant will dwell with holy horror upon the vindictiveness, the
                  cruelty, the insatiate blood-thirst of the savage, and not think worthy of mention
                  the red man's goads to vengeance in his outraged rights and alienated
                  possessions."</p>
               <p>"Prejudice, I fear," said Helen, "does not tincture tradition only: the integrity
                  of history itself is more or less impaired by human bias. The most careful
                  historians differ in inferences, conclusions, and estimate of facts, even when
                  facts themselves are beyond dispute."</p>
               <p>"Horrible! horrible!" exclaimed Howard, starting to his feet with his fingers in
                  his ears. "Have I lived to hear my sister a pedant!"</p>
               <p>Helen was covered with blushes, but answered in the same mock-heroic tone, "Woe is
                  me, that I find my brother a critic!"</p>
               <p>Conway laughed merrily, and essayed to comfort her, by assuring her it was the
                  besetting sin of brotherhood. He had half a dozen chums, good fellows every one,
                  and free and easy; but, to a man, oppressively hypercritical to their sisters. If
                  John Smith's sister ventured to remark that it was cold, John,<pb n="162-163"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000082"/> with brotherly impertinence, would remind her that
                  she had chosen an original subject for conversation. If Mary Jones expressed an
                  innocent desire to walk, her brother Tom would elegantly insinuate she was always
                  on the trot. If Sally Brown dealt in commonplaces, Ben was sure to beg her not to
                  be silly; and if she aimed at something more than ordinary, he was equally urgent
                  upon her not to show off. For his part, he was thankful that he had not a sister
                  to oppress, and thought Miss Walsingham was fortunate in being free from a
                  brother's thrall.</p>
               <p>"Nay," said Viola, "I could be grateful for that sensitive affection which is so
                  keenly alive to the imperfections of its object. The brother whose watchful love
                  was jealous of my faults might make unamiable manifestations with impunity."</p>
               <p>Helen looked fondly at her brother, as if to say she felt all that her friend had
                  expressed; while he smiled on her proudly, as though he did not see any serious
                  fault in her.</p>
               <p>"Apropos of interesting localities, I would like to drive you to Fort A——" (he
                  smiled upon Viola as a moment before he had done upon Helen: certain it is he saw
                  no fault in <emph>her</emph>); "the carriage is at the door, the morning lovely,
                  and you will feel renovated by the drive."</p>
               <p>"Oh, by all means, come!" cried Helen: "and then you must dine with us. It will be
                  such a pleasant surprise to mamma to see you out and looking well."</p>
               <p>Viola consented readily, and the carriage was soon winding down the mountain road,
                  with as merry a party as ever drove through those whispering woodlands in the
                  leafy month of June. And now they were upon the bridge; that fairy-like latticed
                  structure, the airy arches of which had been the wonder of Viola's childhood. The
                  soft blue sky of summer hung above them, the majestic river swept beneath, and far
                  down its shining depths behold another heaven, spanned by the white bow of the
                  graceful bridge. A few minutes' driving along the river bank brought them to the
                  site of the provincial fort. A commodious dwelling of red brick, enclosed in a
                  paled yard and flanked by highly cultivated acres, was all that met the eyes of
                  Cola Conway.</p>
               <p>"What is this?" said he; "I expected to see a fortress, or at the worst a
                  ruin."</p>
               <p>"Fortresses are no longer needed, and ruins cumber the ground," answered Howard.
                  "On the contrary, quiet, happy homesteads are in demand, and this is one."</p>
               <p>"And this trim home of thrift stands on the site of the old Provincial Fort! I
                  cannot say that I like the facility with which my countrymen blot the
                  remembrancers of great events from the face of the earth. The landmarks of the
                  past are falling before the ploughshare of the present, and the associations of a
                  spot like this grow faint when the mementos of its story have perished."</p>
               <p>He had leaped from the carriage, and stood, hat in hand, surveying the scene. His
                  usually animated face was thoughtful and earnest. A new phase, which gave it new
                  interest in the eyes of Helen. She thought, as he stood on the green sward, the
                  river breeze playing with his chestnut curls, that—that Howard was not the
                  handsomest man she had ever seen.</p>
               <pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC5981-00000083"/>
               <p>By that magnetic influence which all have known, he felt her eyes were on him, and
                  turning quickly met their admiring gaze; the thoughtful expression gave place to a
                  bright, triumphant look, and Helen, abashed, looked out toward the farm-house.</p>
               <p>"Do you remember," said Viola, "those stories of the fort old Aunt Jeannie used to
                  tell us? How brave the men were, and the women, too, although they felt at the
                  close of each day that they might never open their eyes upon another dawning.
                  Often, in the gathering darkness of winter twilights, the dusky forms of savages
                  were seen stealing along the crags of the Bluff—there!"</p>
               <p>The little party turned toward the Bluff. The sunshine lay warm upon its ragged
                  side, broken here and there by the shadow of pines. So bright, and warm, and
                  peaceful seemed all things about them, they could not realize the perils past.</p>
               <p>"I have often sat within that dwelling," said Helen, "marking the dull routine of
                  daily commonplaces move along, and wondering how the pulses of life could beat so
                  calmly on a spot consecrated in my mind to deadly perils and mortal dread."</p>
               <p>"That may be a pretty bit of sentiment, sweet sister," said Howard, "but was it
                  not that peaceful homes like this should brighten the land, that the hardy men of
                  old braved those perils?"</p>
               <p>"Doubtless you speak sound philosophy," laughed Cola, whose momentary seriousness
                  had vanished; "but woe is my country! her utilitarian sons have robbed her of her
                  relics. Rome has her ruins—"</p>
               <p>"And when America's day of prosperity is passed, she will have hers. Rome
                     <emph>is</emph> a ruin—people as well as city! Vagrants and lazzaroni fill the
                  city of the Cæsars, and desecrate the classic ground with obscene presence. Could
                  I, by one sweep of my hand, obliterate pillar and ruin, palace and temple, and
                  raise upon the ground they cumber a city of such home-like homes as that, peopled
                  by an industrious and prosperous race, why, presto!—farewell to the ruined Mecca
                  of the student and the poet! Rome would be redeemed!"</p>
               <p>He spoke with energy, and Cola answered in mock distress, "Oh, leveller! oh, red
                  republican! And what shall be left for a poor fellow like myself to dream over? I
                  had intended to sit me down, in a fine frenzy, at Fort Augusta, and indite a
                  patriotic poem—but, alas! the scene is too bucolic."</p>
               <p>Viola looked at him attentively as he spoke, but without the answering smile his
                  light sally seemed to demand. Howard, who watched her face, bent his head toward
                  her, saying—</p>
               <p>"I would give much to know your thoughts."</p>
               <p>"I was thinking," she said, with a blush—for his earnest manner had startled
                  her—"I was thinking that your poetic friend should select a subject for his song
                  from the themes of the troubadour."</p>
               <p>"And was that all?" inquired Howard, with his penetrating gaze still fixed upon
                  her face.</p>
               <p>"No, that was not all," she answered, simply.</p>
               <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC5981-00000084"/>
               <p>He continued to look the question he dared not press in words; but she appeared
                  unconscious of the mute interrogative, and he felt, without knowing why, that she
                  had had a thought of which he was the subject. This did not displease him; young
                  gentlemen are not offended at finding themselves the subject of a fair lady's
                  musings.</p>
               <p>Although Viola hesitated to confide her thoughts to the subject of them, we have
                  not a similar delicacy with regard to our confidential friend, the reader. She had
                  thought that the energetic enthusiasm of Howard fitted him to be the chronicler of
                  those indomitable struggles for the right, the success of which was unattended by
                  the usual brilliant accessories of victory.</p>
               <p>"And was that all?" says the reader to me, as Howard said to Viola.</p>
               <p>"No, that was not all," say I to the reader ingenuously, as Viola answered her
                  interrogator.</p>
               <p>And then the reader looks curious, wishing to know the rest, but I am discreetly
                  silent. For I will not betray that at this point my sweet lady felt excessively
                  hungry.</p>
               <p>Helen, who is a sympathetic friend, must have guessed this, for she suggested that
                  the dinner hour was at hand, and they had better drive home.</p>
               <p>And merrily home drove they, filling the air with laughter, and trampling the
                  sunshine in the dust where it lay. When Nature is so bounteous, her children will
                  be prodigal.</p>
               <p>At dinner, a programme of enjoyments for successive days was arranged by these
                  young votaries of pleasure. We of the work-a-day world cannot follow them, but
                  they are none the less happy.</p>
               <p>It so happened in this intimacy between the two families, that Walsingham and Mrs.
                  Irving were frequently drawn together, and thrown as it were upon each other for
                  companionship by these thoughtless and selfish young people. It may be this was
                  pleasant enough, as it has been seen they were two very attractive persons. About
                  this time there was a great change in George Irving. He was moody, stern, and
                  silent, and seemed moping over some dismal secret.</p>
               <p>Probably stocks were falling.</p>

               <p>HELEN and her mamma sat sewing one morning, when Cola, in hunting garb, presented
                  himself at the door.</p>
               <p>"Come in," said Mrs. Irving, "and tell us where you have been. Not shooting, I
                  hope?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; and have returned, like a faithful knight, to lay my trophies at the feet of
                  beauty," and he glanced at Helen with an air of gallantry.</p>
               <p>"That means mamma," she said, demurely; "she is the beauty of the family!"</p>
               <p>A becoming blush mantled mamma's usually pale face, and her eyes beamed kindly on
                  her daughter.</p>
               <p>She certainly was a lovely matron, the young man thought, although he had not
                  observed it before.</p>
               <p>"I do homage!" he said, kissing her hand, "and wish she was <emph>my</emph>
                  mother."</p>
               <p>I do not understand why Helen grew so red at this. Probably she thought his
                  civility to mamma impertinent.</p>
               <p>Mamma's sense of propriety did not appear to be outraged. She not only suffered
                  him to kiss her hand, but laid it gently on his clustering locks, while she
                  favoured him with a maternal regard.</p>
               <p>"Poor boy!" she said, "you have no mother."</p>
               <p>"No! How did you know that?"</p>
               <p>"Because, I observe you have not the habits which feminine care inculcates."</p>
               <p>He grew very red, now, and laughed.</p>
               <p>"Pray, give me an instance."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, if your childhood had been beguiled by the nursery rhymes and nursery
                  ethics which mothers have always on their tongues, you would not have been gunning
                  in the season when every bird that falls leaves a family of little ones to starve
                  in the nest."</p>
               <p>"The instance does not sustain the argument," replied the saucy culprit; "Howard
                  went gunning, too."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Irving bit her lips.</p>
               <p>"He was the instigator," continued the young man.</p>
               <p>"Did he ask you to go?"</p>
               <p>Cola laughed. "He did not invite me; I was a volunteer. He slung his shot-pouch
                  over his shoulder, and walked forth toward the Bluff. Not knowing anything better
                  to do, I took my accoutrements, and followed him.</p>
               <p>"He has not been very good company, of late, madam, your son has not. This morning
                  he seemed particularly dull.<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC5981-00000086"/> I gave my
                  mind to being agreeable and entertaining, but he did not appear to value my
                  society as it deserved. He seemed studying the inscription on his fowling-piece.
                  When we were half-way up the hill, I was rewarded by a friendly remark."</p>
               <p>"What did he say?"</p>
               <p>"'Cola, you dog, you had better go home, or I'll shoot you.'"</p>
               <p>The ladies laughed heartily.</p>
               <p>"I was afraid he would, madam, and took his advice."</p>
               <p>"I think," he continued, with comic gravity, "that my friend expected to find his
                  game in the eagle's nest, on the Bluff."</p>
               <p>I cannot tell why Helen did not consider herself a beauty. She certainly looked
                  very pretty as she sat at her mother's feet, blushing and laughing, and in many
                  pretty maidenly ways demonstrating her enjoyment of this young man's nonsense. A
                  bracelet, which her mother wore, contained her miniature, and Cola thought the
                  artist had not done her justice. If Nature does not always give to her young
                  daughters the form and tint of beauty, she dowers each from an exhaustless
                  treasury of nameless graces, which are not within the compass of "art's
                  simulation."</p>
               <p>As I have hinted, Cola thought that Helen and her mamma formed a very pretty
                  tableau, and he made her sundry fine speeches to that effect, when an opportunity
                  presented, seeming to be quite as much in earnest as usual.</p>
               <p>Helen's greatest attraction was her musical talent. In this she was greatly
                  superior to Viola, who was merely accomplished in music. Viola was mistress of the
                  instrument, but Helen seemed to play upon heart-chords, bearing her listener on a
                  tide of melody through lofty, impassioned, changing emotions, as in a delicious
                  dream. This is a talent rarely possessed by any save an artist. I knew but one
                  (Heaven bless her!) who carried humbly in her womanly heart this wondrous gift,
                  content to exercise it in the retirement of domestic life for her own delight, and
                  the enjoyment of those she loved.</p>
               <p>Cola Conway was peculiarly susceptible to the influence of music, and surrendered
                  himself to its enthralment with entire abandon. When Helen, of a summer's night,
                  would improvise such tender or melancholy strains as harmonized with the hour, his
                  heart would quiver to the notes as did the atmosphere, and tears flow over his
                  boyish face. Nearer and nearer he would draw, like one enchanted, and crouch on a
                  stool at her side, the abject slave of those sweet sounds—or their creator.</p>
               <p>This young gentleman seemed in a beautiful state of bewilderment between his two
                  charming friends; and, judging from his conduct, might be in love with either.
                  With Viola, he was most easy, fluent, and free. Howard observed, with some
                  resentment, that his friend enjoyed an intimacy with her, such as he who had known
                  her from childhood had failed to establish. They frequently conversed apart in low
                  tones, which ceased on the approach of third persons. More than once he had
                  observed glances of intelligence and affection, he thought, interchanged. The
                  brilliant gayety which he had admired so much in Conway, seemed levity now; and he
                     felt<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC5981-00000087"/> some uneasiness about having
                  introduced his handsome and thoughtless friend to his home.</p>
               <p>Have we not somewhere hinted that our young friend was irascible? Of course, this
                  was highly indecorous and discreditable; the more so as it is such an unusual
                  infirmity of youth. We feel mortified, and in a manner compromised by his
                  weakness; but nevertheless confess it, with a candour which must appear
                  magnanimous.</p>
               <p>Nay, with the most entire frankness, we deprecate the indiscriminate applause of
                  his friends, our readers, and beg their indulgence for the improper spirit in
                  which our young gentleman met the irreverent badinage of Conway. Instead of
                  receiving graciously, or relishing the delicate illusions of his guest, he would
                  knit his brows and frown like the immortal Thunderer, occasionally launching some
                  such bolt as this:—</p>
               <p>"Excuse the suggestion, that your remarks are in bad taste." Or,</p>
               <p>"Sir, oblige me by refraining from innuendoes concerning my—hem—my mother's
                  guests!"</p>
               <p>Or under high pressure:—</p>
               <p>"Look you, Conway! you have guessed my secret; and now <emph>beware how you cross
                     my path!</emph>"</p>
               <p>To which Conway, looking terrified and helpless:—</p>
               <p>"But if a lady should set her heart on me? What would you have a fellow do?"</p>
               <p>"Don't play the fool, sir!" responds Howard, looking as if he would like to rend
                  his dear friend to shreds and give him to the winds.</p>
               <p>"I won't," promises his dear friend, good-naturedly. "I never do. I wish my
                  adviser was equally careful to avoid acting the ruffian!"</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, Cola, my dear fellow! Bear with me! I deserve your reproof. My heart
                  is full of the wildest love for her. I cannot endure that you should come between
                  us, as I sometimes fancy you do. Nay, I am jealous of Helen—of all the world. I
                  have felt so from a boy; for I always loved her. When playmates intruded upon our
                  sports, I would put my arm about her, and draw her away, saying, 'Oh, Viola! I
                  wish there was no one in the whole world but you and I!' Would to heaven I dared
                  do so now!"</p>

               <p>NOW, were the moonlit nights of June!—the carnival of roses! Nature was in festive
                  mood, and the earth was crowned and garlanded. Maidens wore roses in their hair,
                  or on their bosoms. Matrons hung them wantonly to their girdles. Young men tricked
                  them to their button-holes—and old men held them between their teeth; and all the
                  world, by mute acts like these, testified its appreciation of the floral holiday.
                  When the sun went down a great lamp was hung in the heavens to illumine a world
                  too beautiful for the shroud of darkness; and thus lighted and attended, she
                  careered on her appointed path through space, rejoicing.</p>
               <p>Viola and her friends were abroad, enjoying all that the overflowing censers of
                  earth, air, and heaven, presented for the delight of youth.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Irving leaned from her bay window to enjoy the beauty of the night—a night so
                  bright and soft that it seemed a summer day veiled for masquerade. The mountains
                  loomed up in solemn grandeur, while the river rolled between, with the shattered
                  moonbeams sparkling on its bosom, and its murmuring lullaby sounding ceaselessly
                  in nature's ear. The shrubbery in the garden waved to the evening wind, and filled
                  the paths with nodding shadows; while, high in heaven, like an imperial presence,
                  the peerless moon sailed majestically athwart the night.</p>
               <p>How puerile, how pitiful seemed the cares of daily life in the face of that calm
                  majesty! The anxieties which had oppressed the lady's heart were hushed, and
                     <emph>peace,</emph> fit off-spring of that shining presence, possessed her
                  soul.</p>
               <p>She thought of Mary—the dear treasure she had laid up in heaven—and wondered in
                  what realm of light was that pure spirit's appointed home. If she was not
                  permitted to droop from moonlit space and, with unseen presence, sow the seeds of
                  peace in the sorrowing hearts that loved her.</p>
               <p>She thought of her husband, whom she knew so well, admired so much, and loved so
                  tenderly.</p>
               <p>Among men he seemed a stern, straight-forward, resolute man, armed with a
                  practical earnestness that enabled him to<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC5981-00000089"
                  /> subdue difficulties and control circumstances. <emph>She</emph> knew that
                  warmth and depth, as well as strength, characterized his nature. A passionate
                  enthusiasm burned within his bosom, like a volcanic fire; and as the secret glow
                  within the mountain is evidenced by luxuriant growth and richest verdure, so had
                  the hidden warmth of this man's nature beautified life around him.</p>
               <p>She had luxuriated in it, for it was rich in love for her; her children had lived
                  joying in its subtle influence, and all the blossoming hopes of her girlhood had
                  found their full fruition in its vivifying glow.</p>
               <p>But lately there had been a change in him, for which the cares of business failed
                  to account.</p>
               <p>Although not fond of society, he had always taken a kindly interest, nay pleasure,
                  in the social enjoyments of home. Now he seemed to avoid the domestic circle, and,
                  even in the presence of his wife, was silent and constrained.</p>
               <p>What this could portend, her acute instincts, sharpened by wifely affection, had
                  failed to divine. She had not questioned her son or daughter, fearing to attract
                  attention to a change which she did not understand herself; but Howard had
                  observed it, and remarked to her that his father's habits of seclusion seemed to
                  have increased since he was last at home.</p>
               <p>As she thought of these things a dark figure moved among the shadows of the
                  moonlit garden, and, recognising her husband, she flew down the stairs, and along
                  the gravelled paths, to his side.</p>
               <p>"I did not know you had come," she said, kindly, placing her small hand in his.
                  "You do not seek me through the house as you used to do!"</p>
               <p>"I thought you were out with the young people," he answered, abstractedly,
                  submitting to her caress.</p>
               <p>"I was waiting for you, and thinking of you, and of Mary. The moonlight always
                  brings her image before me."</p>
               <p>The sweet influence of the child seemed to come between them in mediation; for the
                  manly nature of the father softened as he listened. Placing an arm about his
                  little wife, and imprinting a kiss upon her fair upturned brow, he drew her down
                  the walk.</p>
               <p>She felt, from these indications, that whatever grief or perplexity oppressed his
                  heart, his love for her was unchanged; but why did he not take her to his bosom's
                  confidence, as he had done heretofore? She had shared the burdens of nearly twenty
                  years, none of which had seemed so heavy as this one weight of withheld
                  confidence. Encouraged by his kiss, she was about to importune him, as did Portia
                  her lord, when the ringing laugh of Helen and Viola, mingled with the deep tones
                  of Howard's voice, announced that the young friends were at hand.</p>
               <p>Up the gravel walk they came, bearing lightly in their bosoms, hearts of youth.
                  Hearts of youth! unchecked, unchilled, unshrinking! As they walked, the very night
                  that had seemed so calm and sad, grew joyous around them. The moonbeams danced
                  amid the roses, and the aspen leaves quivered on the breeze with bird-like
                  ecstasy, as though they would mount towards heaven and sing! How changed in<pb
                     n="178-179" xml:id="VAC5981-00000090"/> the presence of youth and gladness
                  seemed the aspect of the night!</p>
               <p>"You walk too rapidly, Howard," cried Helen to her brother. "Cola and I can hardly
                  keep pace with you, and Viola pants with fatigue."</p>
               <p>"Is it possible that I have been so thoughtless!" he exclaimed, turning to the
                  fair girl leaning on his arm. "When I am excited I always walk rapidly."</p>
               <p>"Excited! What has excited you so much?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Pleasure!</emph>"</p>
               <p>Conway was the querist, but the deep, low answer was poured into Viola's ear,
                  conveying a world of meaning.</p>
               <p>Withdrawing her hand from his arm, she stooped to gather the roses in her path,
                  and the face which had shone so white and fair, wore their hues as she pressed
                  them to her lips.</p>
               <p>"Pleasure, such as I never knew till now," said the young man. "Pleasure which I
                  will soon lose. Viola, the vacations are very short!"</p>
               <p>She did not answer, but placed the flowers in her bosom, and stood with her dreamy
                  eyes upturned, her gauzy garments swaying, cloud-like, to the breeze, and her
                  golden ringlets glistening in the moonlight—a soft, angelic, half-lighted picture,
                  which memory oft recalled in after years.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile Cola and Helen wandered unobserved through the garden paths. His
                  laughing face wore a more earnest expression, and his manner, usually light and
                  free, grew serious and subdued. Helen listened to his words with an expression of
                  enjoyment on her young face, as though music filled the air.</p>
               <p>Ah, his were fluent lips! Had they charmed her heart away?</p>
               <p>Have a care, young Helen! Sweet, guileless, tender girl. Beware, how the passing
                  homage of a versatile and inconstant nature is repaid by that treasure of youth,
                  which true and earnest hearts can but once bestow.</p>
               <p>Garden of roses! rolling green waves of foliage before the wind, and pouring
                  richest incense to the moon! Youth, and hope, and love, dwell in thy bowers
                  to-night. Fleeting and perishable guests, succeeded, perchance, by age,
                  disappointment, and bitterness; while your insensate beauty will bloom on, and
                  year after year smile in the face of heaven with primal freshness!</p>

               </p>
               <p>The music was so inspiring, that both ladies joined in the refrain with such
                  merriment that "Let's go to the woods, said every one," was still echoing when the
                  carriage was announced.</p>
               <p>Viola had been spending a few days with Helen, during which time her philosophical
                  guardian had made a discovery.</p>
               <p>I have said but little of Walsingham of late, partly because, in common with the
                  young ladies, I have been occupied with the collegians, and partly, because
                  deterred by the difficulty of portraying the excellence and dignity of such a
                  character as his. I have feared lest, on the one hand, I should not do justice to
                  his rare qualities; and, on the other, that their faithful delineation might
                  appear like the exaggerated endowments of a fictitious hero.</p>
               <p>But now the development of this simple story requires that I should dwell upon
                  him, even at the risk of marring the harmony of his fine character by unskilful
                     representation,<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC5981-00000092"/> from which I trust
                  the reverence and admiration I have entertained for the man may preserve me.</p>
               <p>Walsingham has made a discovery!</p>
               <p>Be not impatient, reader, but suffer me to impart it to you through the same
                  gradual process by which its bitter sweet was revealed to himself.</p>
               <p>Since his return to the Eyrie he had been a very happy man. In the congenial
                  pursuits to which he systematically devoted his time and talents, his intellectual
                  nature, heretofore restless and craving, reposed in calm content, while his social
                  tastes found a novel pleasure in the constant presence and daily companionship of
                  his cultivated ward. Her tastes assimilated with his own; his favourite themes
                  became hers, partly through her natural love of study, partly because of her
                  regard for him. Whatever interested Walsingham acquired a dignity and importance
                  in her eyes, above and beyond its own, and she hasted to master its mysteries not
                  only for the sake of the attractive knowledge, but that she might better
                  understand <emph>him.</emph> Insensibly, when he came into her presence, he would
                  speak of those subjects which had absorbed his attention during the day; and the
                  language of the library and laboratory became the chit-chat of the tea-table.
                  Viola possessed that womanly appreciative mind, so charming to men of intellect,
                  capable of grasping, comprehending, and admiring, that which their stronger powers
                  create. Her playful fancy and delicate wit would embellish the most abstruse
                  themes, with a grace and lightness, as charming as novel to the fascinated
                  scholar. His mind was microscopic, hers prismatic.</p>
               <p>Viewed through the one medium the truths of science became enlarged, distinct, and
                  clear; through the other, embellished, adorned, and beautified. Thus each borrowed
                  from the other a new medium of vision.</p>
               <p>Her resemblance to her mother occasionally recalled the past, but he was too
                  profoundly happy for its memory to pain him now. It seemed a tender half-forgotten
                  dream, and he lived only in the holy calm of this blessed era, feeling, believing,
                  that thus their lives would flow pleasantly to the end.</p>
               <p>But when these collegians came fluttering around her daily paths; basking in the
                  sunshine of her beauty; engrossing her attention and time; bearing her now here,
                  now there, in the pursuit of pleasure, while he remained in solitude at home; he
                  pushed aside his books, and reflected seriously of her—himself—the future! She was
                  young and beautiful. She would be wooed, probably won, by some one of these
                  flutterers, and borne from the home she graced for ever. <emph>She, his
                     own!</emph> His own no longer, but another's!</p>
               <p>His pale face flushed indignantly with the thought of this wrong to him, for such
                  it seemed. Had he not reared her almost from infancy, until she had grown into his
                  heart and life, and now, when the care was past, the task performed, the flower
                  unfolded, should another gather its bloom and rejoice in its perfume?</p>
               <p>Ay! even thus fathers lose the daughters most dear to their hearts.</p>
               <p>Ay, again! but he was <emph>not</emph> her father.</p>
               <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC5981-00000093"/>
               <p>Thus it was that Walsingham made a discovery, and ere this you, dear reader, have
                  made it too.</p>
               <p>Neither philosophical or scientific, but natural withal, was this new revelation.
                  He <emph>loved!</emph> He loved his ward. Luminous as a new-found planet, when
                  brightening through darkness, on the vision of the rapt discoverer, was this new
                  star set in his heaven. It beamed on his solitude, heralding to his manhood the
                  happiness denied his youth.</p>
               <p>He loved! <emph>he</emph> who had loved but once, and loved so long—so
                  faithfully—so hopelessly. From out the very ashes of that rare passion sprang
                  forth the new love phœnix-like. It spread its white wings around him, filling his
                  heart with a rapture of wild surprise.</p>
               <p>He felt that he had quaffed at some immortal fountain and renewed his youth. Life,
                  glorious, blessed life—its hopes—its promises—were before him once more, <q>
                     <l>"With crowns of the sunshine and garlands of bloom."</l>
                  </q> His heart was reclaimed from barrenness!—his home redeemed from
                  desolation!—he <emph>loved!</emph>—he lived again!</p>
               <p>But in this delirium of delight a baleful thought arose. Viola was very young.
                  He—alas! <emph>was he not old?</emph> He had not felt so. He had not thought so,
                  save in contrast with her. Then he composed his mind to a self-analysis, by which
                  he might discover of what time had robbed him, and wherein the man differed from
                  the youth. The result was satisfactory. He found his experiences were more
                  enlarged, his judgment mellowed, and his mind matured. His enthusiasm had deepened
                  with deepening thought. His ardour glowed with maturer, manlier fire. In all
                  things he felt himself to be wiser and worthier in his majestic manhood than in
                  his undeveloped youth. Time had robbed him of nought—had bestowed much. In the
                  fulness of his strengthened nature he felt himself superior to the freshness of
                  untried life.</p>
               <p>"The mind is deathless," thought he. "Is it not also ageless? Is not its
                  immortality an immortality of <emph>youth?</emph> It is in the frailer shell which
                  the mind for a brief period inhabits, frets, rends, and abandons, that we should
                  seek those symptoms of decay which men call age;" and he turned abruptly to the
                  mirror. It reflected to his inquiring eyes the glory of manhood at its height of
                  perfection. His fine figure, his superb head, and intellectual face, were not such
                  as ladies regard with indifference. His keenly critical gaze slowly changed to a
                  triumphant one, and, throwing himself upon the sofa, he indulged anew in delicious
                  hopes and golden visions.</p>
               <p>The veriest trifles are often pivots upon which our lives turn. Had Viola returned
                  then, he would have bared to her his full heart, bursting with its new found
                  passionate love, and perchance have won her with the enraptured eloquence so dear
                  to woman. But she was wandering in the moonlit garden, and a manly voice was
                  pouring in her ear such words as gave her glimpses of another love as
                  wild—perchance as true as his own.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the pertinacious self-examiner lay on his studysofa pursuing the new
                  theme.</p>
               <p>"It will not be always thus," he said. "Will not the time come<pb n="186-187"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000094"/> when age and discrepitude shall steal upon this
                  strong frame, and it shall stand bowed and broken, beside her glorious womanhood,
                  presenting the unnatural union of youth with age—scarcely less loathsome than the
                  tie that bound the living to the dead?" The thought was agony, and hot dews
                  started to his brow as he sprang to his feet, ejaculating,—"As I am a true man I
                  will spare her this!"</p>
               <p>Hitherto, he had thought only of the possibility of winning her virgin heart. Now,
                  he felt there would be an impropriety in attempting it. Was he not her guardian?
                  Had he not always appeared to her armed with parental authority? It is true he had
                  not used this authority; but by virtue of his position she had always accorded to
                  him a daughter's obedience and devotion. His lightest wish had been the law of her
                  life, and was there not great danger, if he approached her as a lover, that she
                  should yield to his suit from habitual obedience, or from gratitude, while all her
                  young instincts prompted a different choice? Should he, of all men most bound to
                  protect her from peril, lead her into this loveless—joyless doom?</p>
               <p>But if, growing strong in such an emergency, she should, with self-reliant
                  firmness, reject his suit, what then? The home of a rejected lover could not be
                  the home of a spirited and delicately conscious woman; the dear relationship
                  between them would be rudely severed, and whither could the poor friendless one
                  turn, if she should seek to fly from him? Ah, why will fate tempt men thus!</p>
               <p>The night passed in bitter mental conflict; but the morning dawned upon a serene
                  and resolute man. Over his strong passion, his stronger mind had obtained the
                  victory. As honour and generosity dictated, he was resolved to guard the beloved
                  one as faithfully, more tenderly than ever; to avoid disturbing, by word or look,
                  the innocent unconsciousness with which she reposed in the shelter of his home; to
                  protect her from himself, and to crucify his love as he had done before.</p>
               <p>When Viola returned, escorted by her friends, his pale countenance, quiet manner,
                  and grave welcome betrayed nought of the conflict of the night. They touched her,
                  however, with a feeling of reproach for her desertion; and by various winning,
                  womanly devices, she strove to make amends for her absence, thereby rendering her
                  presence more dangerously dear.</p>

               <head type="sub">SUNDRIES.</head>
               <p>VACATION ended, the students returned to their "<foreign xml:lang="LAT">alma
                     mater,</foreign>" like rebellious step-children, bearing with them remembrances
                  such as fed fine fancies, while study stood aside an-hungered, like the stork at
                  the fox's feast.</p>
               <p>However much the friends of these young men, and society at large, may have
                  regretted the loss of such social ornaments, Walsingham was unfeignedly gratified
                  by their absence. He could more uninterruptedly enjoy that sweet companionship
                  which was all the aliment allowed his secret passion. The time when his darling
                  should be borne from him by some younger, happier man, her heart's elect, seemed
                  more distant. In their absence he felt reprieved.</p>
               <p>Walsingham did not associate the most meagre hope with his love. He indulged in
                  nought beyond an earnest wish that the evil day destined to separate him from his
                  beloved might be far distant, and that he might protect, guard, and minister to
                  her pleasures, and in return enjoy the sunshine of her blessed presence a few
                  years more. The feverish dream of his youth had prostrated his energies. This love
                  of his matured heart—this calm, patient, and unselfish passion, lifted up his
                  manhood; filled him with aspirations and resolves; elevated and refined his
                  character. Dearer grew she day by day; and as his love deepened, so strengthened
                  his resolve. The one, was the test and touchstone of the other. The dearer Viola,
                  the dearer Viola's happiness. That happiness it was his privilege to guard.</p>
               <p>He was resolved not to disqualify himself for the fulfilment of his trust by a
                  betrayal of his secret passion; and with constant self-watchfulness and utter
                  self-abnegation he laid his hand upon his heart and curbed its wild desires with a
                  strong will.</p>
               <p>Alas! that woman should inspire such love as this, and be unmindful of it! Why do
                  not the invisible, all-seeing angels, pause on their errands of mercy to whisper
                  to her that the sands of life beneath her dancing feet are <emph>golden!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>In the mind of the matured man <emph>love</emph> did not extinguish
                     <emph>ambition.</emph> From the suppression of one passion, Walsingham sought
                  solace in the gratification of another. His study in the lonely turret witnessed
                  many laborious vigils; and the work which was to give honour to his name, and his
                  name to the world, progressed.</p>
               <p>Great works are often achieved by the miserable while the happy lie supine, for
                     <emph>anguish is a mental goad.</emph> The mind is most active when ill at
                  ease: as steel is tempered by fire, so<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC5981-00000096"/>
                  are the faculties of man sharpened by trial. Thus it happened that the very
                  contest with self which Walsingham feared would distract his mind, strengthened it
                  for the effort of labour: his work was better performed, and mankind ultimately
                  benefited by his secret pangs.</p>
               <p>While Walsingham, ever near, was thus watchful to conceal his feelings, Viola's
                  distant lover chafed for the time when he might bare his heart to her. Of the
                  result of this disclosure he did not doubt. Such love as his could not be vain.
                  Could he, he thought, for a few golden moments, speak his passion, as eloquently
                  as it thrilled him, her womanly sympathies <emph>must</emph> respond. Such
                  language must kindle in her heart a kindred feeling.</p>
               <p>But he had left her with those potent words unspoken—with her virgin heart
                  untouched. Young, beautiful, gifted as she was, might not another in his absence
                  bespeak its sympathies and waken it to love?</p>
               <p>The thought of rivals exasperated him. She was exclusively his own. Had he not
                  singled her out among women, and sealed her his, with worship? Dare others
                  approach and breathe upon the shrine whereon his heart was laid?</p>
               <p>He felt himself injured when he heard of her womanly triumphs; for, as he had
                  pictured, Viola was courted and admired. It appeared to him that the block or cord
                  were the appropriate rewards of those who lifted their eyes to his divinity. He
                  heartily wished she was safe in some desert island, under the guardianship of
                  fiery dragons, like an enchanted princess. Then would he come, and with his love
                  and valour, subdue the monsters, break the spells, and win the reward. Or,
                  consigned to the keeping of some convent, saying aves and dropping beads, far from
                  the presuming admiration of men, until his love should overcome obstacles such as
                  had deterred those who were faint of heart, and he should bear his jewel from the
                  convent shadows, and hold it up in the sunlight, dazzling the world with its
                  beauty.</p>
               <p>Oh, heart of youth!</p>
               <p>Of the emotions of Walsingham, Viola was as unconscious as a child; but with quick
                  womanly insight, she perceived all that her younger lover burned to reveal. And
                  while the great archer had been busy in their midst, had he no shaft for her?</p>
               <p>Over the chaos of her heart a Great Spirit moved. That which in her young nature
                  had been without form, and void, took shape beneath its brooding wing, and a new
                  creation, a glad existence, sprang up within her. Love had birth in her virgin
                  heart.</p>
               <p>How lovely are the loving! Viola's cheek flushed, and her eyes beamed with softer,
                  tenderer, holier light. Her whole nature seemed to glow and expand with the new
                  life within.</p>
               <p>Alas for Walsingham, who marked the glorious change in her, as he noted every
                  light or shade upon her ever-varying face! He did not know the cause. He did not
                  divine that love was beauty's inspiration! He only felt that she grew more
                  dangerously dear with every passing day; and that to abide by his determination
                  with this lovely temptress by his side, required a resolution strong as death.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, letters from the Captain were received, announcing<pb n="192-193"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000097"/> ing his return home. "Hang me, Arthur," quoth he,
                  "you are foredoomed to play Sinbad to this Old Man of the Sea. Tell the little
                  birdeen of the cro' nest, to don her best pinafore, and prettiest monkey tricks
                  for the delectation of her old uncle. Though, bless me! she must have outgrown
                  both, and learned girls' tricks, by this time; from which, Jupiter deliver me,
                  bachelor as I am!"</p>

               <p>AND so the summer, all glorious in that land, glided from out the valley. Wind and
                  storm challenged the mountains, and howled about the Eyrie home. Did they call
                  upon Walsingham, that he would arise and go forth as at the bidding of familiar
                  voices? He loved the storm. It harmonized with the tone of his mind. It seemed a
                  type of anguish, of wrestling, and of triumph. When its rage was the highest, he
                  quaffed at its broken fountains and was refreshed. His striving soul was awed to
                  calm by the contention of elements,<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC5981-00000098"/> and
                  peace followed the footsteps of the storm in nature, and in the bosom of nature's
                  votary.</p>
               <p>After a night spent in such communion, the morning dawned moist and gray. Viola
                  looked from her window upon impenetrable fog. The pines that had moaned so
                  piteously through the night were invisible. Familiar objects were shrouded in
                  dreary blank—and throwing up the casement, she rested her cheek on her hand and
                  gazed forth dreamily.</p>
               <p>"Good-morrow," cried a voice beneath the window. "Where are your thoughts
                  wandering?"</p>
               <p>"Lost in a fog," she answered, with a smile like sunshine breaking through
                  mist.</p>
               <p>"Will you not come down and walk?" said Walsingham; "the morning is soft and
                  warm."</p>
               <p>"I am afraid I shall lose my way," she said, as a moment after she came forth.</p>
               <p>"I will be your guide," he answered, taking her hand. "Shall we go toward the
                  river?"</p>
               <p>"Now we are near the precipice," he continued, and his grasp insensibly tightened.
                  "This is the cliff that hangs above the river—now look abroad."</p>
               <p>She peered down and strained her eyes to catch some outline of the familiar
                  landscape, but in vain. River and vale were lost, and she saw nought but dense
                  vapours rolling in sullen billows like a mysterious sea, while up from the
                  impenetrable depth arose the roar of waters.</p>
               <p>"This is strange and grand!" she said, and paused to listen.</p>
               <p>"Does it not remind you of the primal chaos?" inquired Walsingham. "Imagine the
                  earth once more without form, and void! Look at those striving, struggling,
                  writhing wreaths of mist, and think of the Spirit of God brooding upon the face of
                  the deep, and labouring with creation."</p>
               <p>She was for a moment thoughtful, and then exclaimed, "I cannot! I know there is a
                  broad and beautiful world around us, although it is wrapped from vision by this
                  cold veil."</p>
               <p>"If you had never seen it, could you realize this?"</p>
               <p>She turned her large eyes on him seriously, and answered, "Yes. There is another
                  world, beautiful, illimitable, and invisible. This I have never seen, yet I
                  believe."</p>
               <p>"The veil that separates us therefrom is slight as that which now shrouds the
                  material world. So slight that a breath—the parting breath—dispels it."</p>
               <p>Walsingham looked upon her rapt face, and thought of Raphael's angels.</p>
               <p>"How strange," she exclaimed, looking up, "that I can see nothing in the whole
                  wide world but you!"</p>
               <p>It was a delicious thought to him, and he thanked the mist that thus enclosed them
                  on their isolated rock. He felt that all the world might be shrouded, darkened,
                  lost to him, so that he might stand thus, above the chaos, with his beloved by his
                  side, shedding around his life the brightness of her presence, which was dearer
                  than sunlight.</p>
               <p>The wild emotion in his heart struggled for utterance. His temptation beset him
                  sorely, but she looked so fair, so childlike, so trusting, that he re-resolved to
                  lay a restraining hand upon his passion. "I will," thought he, "be faithful to
                     my<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC5981-00000099"/> trust, and protect her from all
                  peril—protect her from myself." And feeling there was peril in his presence,
                  walked abruptly away.</p>
               <p>She looked wonderingly after his retreating figure, and feared she had
                  offended.</p>
               <p>He paused under the pines to look at her. She stood where he had left her, her
                  face and figure indistinctly seen through the heavy atmosphere, but he felt that
                  her eyes looked sadly on him. A soft south wind fluttered her garments, and drove
                  the twining mist-wreaths about her till she seemed blended with them as something
                  shadowy and unreal. Her sunny hair floated around her face in golden glory, and
                  she appeared like some beautiful beatified spirit, half-revealed through the
                  intangible veil of that spiritual world of which she had spoken. Again the divine
                  creations of his favourite Master were remembered. Haloed seraphs gazing tenderly
                  through cleft heavens—and she seemed no more the warm, loving, living woman who
                  had awakened the emotions of his manhood, but that earlier idol, whom she
                  resembled, now enshrined among the stars.</p>
               <p>Thus the fair face of the dead mingles with the dim and distant memories of youth.
                  Thus it looks forth from its world of shadows upon his temptation and struggle.
                  The thought inspired him with resolution to be steadfast. The poetic mantle with
                  which his excited imagination had draped surrounding things fell, and he saw them
                  as they were. She, fair child, upon the rock, exposed to chilling winds and
                  unwholesome wholesome vapours—he, a practical man, with duties to perform. He
                  returned to her, saying—</p>
               <p>"You have been here too long; let us go in."</p>
               <p>"I am glad you came back for me," she said, simply. "I thought I had displeased
                  you."</p>
               <p>"You never displease me, my child."</p>
               <p>His tone was tender, but it was not the tenderness of a lover.</p>
               <p>The day that opened so dully was not without its brightness. Helen came, and the
                  two friends, always so happy together, were doubly so from having been long
                  parted.</p>
               <p>In the evening, when shutters and curtains were closed, and lamps lighted, the
                  skilfully-packed anthracite glowed like a wall of fire. It looked so bright, so
                  warm, so genial, in that cosy parlour, that those young creatures might be
                  pardoned for forgetting there was bitter suffering, and want, and cold prowling
                  without. Walsingham looked in for a moment, ere he betook himself to his sanctum,
                  and was so charmed with the cheerfulness which we describe, and still more with
                  the sweetly-smiling faces to which all this was mere setting, that he ensconced
                  himself in a corner with his book, and read, or looked, or listened, as the humour
                  prompted.</p>
               <p>Helen was achieving some feminine miracle with black and red silk, on the point of
                  an ugly-looking hooked needle, like a dentist's instrument, while Viola, as though
                  inspired by the indefatigability of her friend's performance, cut and punched
                  great holes in muslin, and then incontinently sewed them up again.</p>
               <pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC5981-00000100"/>
               <p>"Helen, why do you sit so still?" she said after having achieved some unusually
                  large punctures.</p>
               <p>"Do I? It is because I cannot work and talk together, I suppose;" and she tortured
                  the red silk relentlessly.</p>
               <p>"What a pity! Now, the faster I work the faster I talk; the fingers perform a
                  running accompaniment to the tongue. It is like playing on the piano, and singing,
                  I think—Apropos! shall we not have music?"—and she threw her embroidery down with
                  its last stab unhealed. Helen gave a final and fearful lunge with her
                  suspicious-looking instrument, and grappled the black silk without compassion.</p>
               <p>"There!" said she, holding it up to view, "I have finished that figure; does it
                  not look pretty? By the way, Viola, you never crochet."</p>
               <p>"No. It sets my teeth on edge to look at you. I always think of dentistry."</p>
               <p>Helen laughed. "I never think of that. You who have so much time, might make such
                  pretty bags and purses for yourself."</p>
               <p>"I am not sure of that," said Viola; "you are always crocheting; how many bags and
                  purses do you own?"</p>
               <p>Helen blushed, and laughed again.</p>
               <p>"Not one, of course," continued her friend; "I knew you hadn't. I should not have
                  either. Now, my weakness is embroidery. I take especial delight in the manufacture
                  of collars, but no sooner do I finish one than with a morbid thirst for
                  approbation I display it to a host of admiring friends. She whose plaudits are
                  loudest and longest usually receives the prize as a reward for her good taste, and
                  a token of my gratitude. But we are forgetting the music."</p>
               <p>Helen, with her terrible little instrument, gave a series of pokes, punches, and
                  lunges, right and left, and laid the writhing silks aside.</p>
               <p>There was something inexpressibly sweet to Walsingham in the nonsense of these
                  girlish chatterers. He sat with eyes intent upon the volume before him; but their
                  voices occasionally struck his ear, causing a brighter thread to mingle with the
                  woof of thought, as the babble of brooks or twittering of birds attune the mind of
                  the wayfarer to music.</p>
               <p>Helen ceased playing, and Viola exclaimed, with tears in her eyes, "How beautiful!
                  Dear gifted Helen, I envy you!"</p>
               <p>"Envy <emph>me?</emph> You mock me," said Helen, with a displeased air.</p>
               <p>"Nay, I will not be answered thus," said her friend, embracing her. "I must envy
                  you. It is glorious to possess a gift like yours. Do you not play upon our very
                  heartstrings? Do you not make us weep tears so delicious that weeping seems a joy?
                  Oh, Helen, I have seen Cola shed such tears, as I have wept to-night. Teach
                     <emph>me</emph> your spell!"</p>
               <p>She covered her face with her hands, as though to hide her emotion. Walsingham's
                  book fell to the floor, and his pale face was flushed as he recovered it; but he
                  did not look toward the girls.</p>
               <p>A moment after, she dropped her hands in her lap, and turned on Helen a face
                  radiant with smiles, although the long eyelashes were heavy with moisture.</p>
               <pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC5981-00000101"/>
               <p>"I believe you are in earnest, dear, partial, foolish girl," said Helen, kissing
                  her wet eyes. "But there is no gift of mine worthy your envy."</p>
               <p>"If you do not know it, it is time you should," said Viola, impetuously. "Helen,
                  you are a musical <emph>genius.</emph> There, you need not smile, but listen. You
                  and I, with half a dozen others, were the pupils of one common master. Except
                  yourself, we all have the same touch, the same expression, and are known wherever
                  we go as Givonni's pupils. <emph>You</emph> have an individuality of your own.
                     <emph>You</emph>—you—when did ever I make one weep? Yours is not an art, but an
                     <emph>inspiration.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Helen looked at the animated girl, and was so absorbed in the contemplation of her
                  beauty that she scarcely heard her. "Strange!" she answered, with a sigh, "that
                  you, whom I so much envy, should envy me!"</p>
               <p>"Don't speak so earnestly, dearest. I do not envy you in reality—I admire and love
                  you, and I love your gift in you. I would rather it belonged to you than myself,
                  though; for I believe I can enjoy it more. Nor must you envy me."</p>
               <p>"I can't help it; and you are so winning that I must tell you why. I know that I
                  do possess musical genius—I have felt it within me! I have seen its effect upon
                  those about me:" and her face, for a moment, glowed with conscious power.</p>
               <p>"I don't think," she added, "one can possess a rare gift without being conscious
                  of it; do you?"</p>
               <p>Viola looked at her in amused surprise, and answered—</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>The momentary light faded from her face, leaving it troubled. "Don't think me
                  vain," she resumed, appealingly, "or you will do me injustice, for I am not. I am
                  conscious of this power, and tell you of it, as frankly as though communing with
                  my own mind. I am also conscious" (her tone grew very humble) "that I have nothing
                  else."</p>
               <p>Viola smiled, and shook her head.</p>
               <p>"I am not witty and wise, as you are; nor am I beautiful. The gift which is mine,
                  I do not value; yours I covet."</p>
               <p>"Wit and wisdom you have been pleased to attribute to me; they are quite at your
                  service," said Viola, mockingly.</p>
               <p>Helen shook her head.</p>
               <p>"I do not want them, for they are worthless in women. I should care as little for
                  them as for my own talent. No one loves us for them, Viola."</p>
               <p>The tone, in which these last words were spoken, was so sad, that Viola threw her
                  arms about her, exclaiming, "Helen!"</p>
               <p>"Beauty is the gift most dear in women. Beauty is what my heart has longed for,
                  and it is denied me. My love for forms of perfectness is a passion. My mind is
                  filled with conceptions of grace and loveliness. My daily life is peopled with
                  glorious ideals, and, with a world of beauty within and around me, I wonder that
                  my grosser part does not take the impress of my thought, and grow to beauty
                  also."</p>
               <p>"Helen, your mind, upon this subject, has lost its tone. You have grown
                  morbid."</p>
               <p>"It may be so. Loving beauty, as I do; feeling profoundly<pb n="202-203"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000102"/> as I do beauty's power, how can I help lamenting
                  that this precious gift of our sex has been denied me? Do I not see, too, that it
                  is only beauty that wins that homage which is so dear to women? Gentleness is
                  applauded and—<emph>oppressed.</emph> Genius is a flame for the multitude to
                  marvel at and avoid—but beauty! beauty is caressed, beloved, worshipped. Beauty is
                  nature's dower to woman, and wins her that which her heart most yearns
                     for—<emph>love.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Look, darling!"</p>
               <p>Helen turned in the direction indicated, and saw the reflection of herself and
                  friend in the opposite pier. Her eyes were bright, her cheeks flushed, and her
                  whole countenance radiant with excitement. She could not but perceive that she
                  looked pretty.</p>
               <p>"There is a mute witness ready to contradict you on your main point," said Viola,
                  kissing her. "Do you not see that nature has been a bountiful mother, bestowing
                  the very gift you covet, although withholding the consciousness of
                  possession?"</p>
               <p>"Don't attempt to impose upon my vanity," said Helen, pettishly. "You know I am
                  plain."</p>
               <p>"I won't, but I will appeal to your judgment. Beauty does not consist in
                  perfection of form and colour, little enthusiast, else why are the most regular
                  faces so often distasteful? It is arbitrary, depending upon the taste of the
                  beholder, and that taste itself is dependent upon a hundred minor considerations.
                  I'll venture to say now that you and I will not agree upon the appearance of any
                  of our friends."</p>
               <p>"I'm sure," said Helen, with an air of triumph, "all the world agrees that Miss
                  Ellsmere is lovely, and you will not be a heretic. It is to me a delight to gaze
                  upon her. In her presence, I hold my breath, and cannot speak; my admiration is so
                  profound."</p>
               <p>Viola laughed; and Helen, again blushing, exclaimed, "Why do you laugh?"</p>
               <p>"Because you are such a dear little simpleton of an enthusiast, in the first
                  place, and because I am thinking how shocked you will be, by the sacrilege which I
                  shall offer your idol in the second; now, what will you say, when I tell you the
                  sight of Miss Ellsmere is positively disagreeable to me?"</p>
               <p>"Impossible!"</p>
               <p>"She has no more animation or expression than a death's head. She looks like one
                  of those hideous waxen counterfeits of life, cast in a perfect mould, and softly
                  coloured, at which I never could look in childhood without shuddering. I tell you,
                  Helen, she has no more soul than one of them, and cannot be beautiful to me."</p>
               <p>"How can you be so horrid! There is an expression in her beautiful eyes—"</p>
               <p>"Of fatuity, yes. I have seen as good glass ones."</p>
               <p>"This is perverseness."</p>
               <p>"Now don't be angry, Helen; you are my beauty. I know your features are not as
                  regular as a Greek model, but I never saw a more speaking face. When we are in
                  company together, I listen to those about me, and watch you in the distance, as a
                  school girl steals glances at an interesting volume. I see<pb n="204-205"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000103"/> the play of expression that seems to speak; the
                  eloquent blood in its ebb and flow, at one moment flushing, and at another leaving
                  you pale, and always think, 'she is the most charming.'"</p>
               <p>Helen hid her face on the shoulder of her friend, exclaiming, "how can you say so,
                  how can you think so, Viola?"</p>
               <p>"Why, you foolish little thing," pursued that merry young lady, "it is because I
                  love you, and that brings me to the second head of my discourse.</p>
               <p>"You have a pretty little theory, which your own observation of facts will not
                  sustain. You said that beauty awakened love. Not the love which such women as you
                  and I would value. There are certain personal advantages which render the
                  possessor conspicuous, and command the fickle regard of the multitude; but if you
                  could follow them to their firesides, you would find them not more tenderly or
                  fondly loved than those who pass unobserved through the thoroughfares of life. In
                  their thousand homes, these plain ones are beautiful; for love invests its object
                  with this charm. Therefore is it, that while to the world, and in your own esteem,
                  you are but plain, to me you are beautiful. You are also beautiful to all who love
                  you; let that content you, or I shall believe it is not affection for which you
                  are athirst, but admiration."</p>
               <p>Helen answered this dose of bitter sweet with one of her usual blushes, and a meek
                  dropping of the eyelids, that seemed to signify she would meditate upon this
                  consolation for the sisterhood of plain ones.</p>
               <p>Viola watched her archly for a moment, but as she watched, the playful expression
                  faded, giving place to seriousness.</p>
               <p>"My friend sets an undue value upon a fleeting gift," she said softly, "when she
                  prefers it to those endowments of mind which are imperishable. Beauty is of the
                  earth, earthy. It fades with the breath of time, and ends in corruption; while the
                  endowments of the soul brighten and increase in glory with passing time, and are
                  themselves immortal."</p>
               <p>"You talk very beautifully," said Helen, with a dash of bitterness; "perhaps
                  because you are beautiful. Having all that the heart of woman can desire to make
                  the present golden, your mind, uncramped by need or want now, can calmly
                  speculate, philosophize, and wonder what new sources of delight await upon its
                  hereafter."</p>
               <p>"Helen, you are a naughty girl, and I shall send you to bed;" and Viola rang for
                  lights.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
               <head type="sub">A GOOSE-QUILL SHAFT DOUBLE-BARBED.</head>
               <p>COLA had written in Helen's album, had copied verses for her, addressed her in
                  epigrams, and in various other ways afforded her opportunities of studying his
                  chirography; she therefore, on coming down to breakfast, recognised his dashing
                  characters upon a letter which Walsingham gave Viola.</p>
               <p>A letter! who can calculate the joy or grief within its folds! It is the enchanted
                  pavilion, which one may hide in palm or pocket, but which, when unfurled, may
                  cover the army of hopes, fears, and fancies trooping through the realm of
                  thought.</p>
               <p>Poor Helen had learned to love this light-hearted boy. Perhaps he had been at some
                  pains to teach her the sweet lesson; and this evidence of familiar intercourse
                  between her lover and her friend, filled her heart with dismay. That beautiful
                  friend, of whom she was half envious, half proud, and who might prove so dangerous
                  a rival. 'Twas but a letter, but he had never written to her, who would have
                  treasured a line of his like "letters of gold upon pictures of silver." She had
                  found in his room, after he returned to college, a sheet of blotting paper
                  scrawled over with her name. The delighted girl laid this treasure between the
                  leaves of her Bible, where nightly it shared her devotions, and divided her young
                  heart with its God. And he had written to Viola <emph>four</emph> pages! Her own
                  startled eyes beheld that favoured girl smiling over them. They had been very
                  intimate, she remembered, when together. Viola had seemed strangely in his
                  confidence; had told to Helen many things about his family which she never would
                  have known.</p>
               <p>Could it be possible that he had loved Viola? He who with honeyed compliments and
                  tender whisperings had wiled her heart away! Those words of his, over which she
                  pondered, extracting new meaning—the hoarded sentences she had delighted to repeat
                  to her heart daily—were these treasures of memory meaningless? Mere folly with
                  which a heartless young man had beguiled his time? She grew livid at the thought,
                  that she, so timidly proud, so sensitive, should have been the dupe of these.</p>
               <p>He had appeared so earnest, plead the poor girl to herself. His heart had seemed
                  in his words, while his bright face wore such frankness and sincerity. Was this
                  but part of his hypocrisy?</p>
               <p>"Oh," cried Viola, folding her letter, "what a negligent hostess I have been! Mr.
                  Walsingham gone without his tea! and poor Helen sitting like pale patience!" and
                  she bustled among the china before her in housewifely style.</p>
               <pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC5981-00000105"/>
               <p>"What will you have, Helen, this morning?"</p>
               <p>"I believe I—I—don't want any breakfast either."</p>
               <p>"Nay, then you are not well, for breakfast is your favourite meal. How white you
                  are, too! Does your head ache, darling?"</p>
               <p>Helen put her hand helplessly to her head.</p>
               <p>"Ah, I see! 'tis one of your nervous headaches. A cup of hot black tea, and some
                  toast, will do you good;" and Viola placed them before her.</p>
               <p>Helen essayed to eat, but it seemed to choke her.</p>
               <p>"At least drink your tea," persisted Viola. "It is the very thing for a nervous
                  headache;" and she held the cup to her lips.</p>
               <p>"Viola, why will you tease me so!" cried the poor victim, pushing it away.</p>
               <p>"There, there!" said Viola, smoothing her hair, and speaking soothingly, "I won't
                  tease you, darling. You shall go back to your own room and rest quietly. I will
                  bathe your head, and drop the curtains, and leave you to sleep."</p>
               <p>Helen suffered herself to be led away like one walking in sleep. She lay upon her
                  couch as Viola directed, and closed her eyes, as though to shut out misery. She
                  felt the silken covering laid softly over her, and gentle hands passing
                  magnetically about her brow. Then a light kiss on her cheek, and she was left
                  alone with her first great grief.</p>
               <p>Viola, having left her friend, as she thought, to sleep, sought Walsingham's
                  study. The guardian had retired to his den no less perturbed than Helen. He too
                  knew the writing on that woful letter, and thought the hour so long dreaded was at
                  hand. When Viola tapped at the door he nerved himself for an interview which he
                  felt would be painful, and opened it. How reverently he held it as she passed!</p>
               <p>"I have come to make a confession," she said, with her happy smile.</p>
               <p>He bowed, handed her a chair, and drew one for himself near her.</p>
               <p>"I can hardly forgive myself," she began, "for having had a secret from you,—but—I
                  was so surprised myself, at first—and then—indeed, it all seems so strange, I
                  hardly know how to tell you!"</p>
               <p>How beautiful she looked, blushing at her own incoherence.</p>
               <p>The watchful guardian hastened to relieve his darling from her embarrassment. "You
                  need not tell me," he said, "I know all."</p>
               <p>"Did <emph>he</emph> tell you?" she exclaimed quickly. "He wished to do so at
                  first, but I—I could not bear to have you learn your little girl's secret from any
                  lips save her own."</p>
               <p>"No, he did not. Mine is a watchful and quick-witted love, Viola. I discovered it
                  myself!"</p>
               <p>"I ought to have told you at first," she said, "but had not courage. Is it not
                  strange, he felt drawn to me from the first moment he saw me, and I to him. Oh, I
                  have been so happy! I hope you like him, sir!"</p>
               <p>Might he not now, at the moment when he felt she was lost to him for ever,
                  compensate his self-denying love with one embrace? He gathered her to his breast,
                  and held her close and<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC5981-00000106"/> long: so close
                  that she felt against her own the beatings of that great heart, so steadfast in
                  endurance; and had, perhaps, a vague foreshadowing of the purest passion that ever
                  anguished the soul of man.</p>
               <p>"God in Heaven bless and keep my little girl!"</p>
               <p>She did not know the emotions that struggled for mastery in the heart of
                  Walsingham, but the evident love and suffering in his manner touched her deeply;
                  her downcast eyes filled with tears, and when she again looked up he was gone.</p>
               <p>Viola did not know why, but she no longer felt happy. Her loving and light-hearted
                  confidence had been checked. The brief, confused, and constrained sentences she
                  had uttered had been insufficient to express what she desired to say. She stood
                  alone in the library, for some minutes, trying to recall exactly what had passed,
                  hoping thereby to account for the change in herself. The influence had been too
                  subtle for her to trace its operations, and with a shaking of her puzzled head she
                  returned to Helen's chamber, and proceeded to apply remedies to the aching
                  brow.</p>
               <p>"Don't!" said Helen; "I can't bear it."</p>
               <p>"Bear what, Helen?"</p>
               <p>"Touch, sound, sensation," murmured she; "all are so intolerable. The repose of
                  death seems sweet in contrast."</p>
               <p>Viola was shocked, but at this moment she heard Mrs. Irving's carriage coming for
                  her daughter. She flew to the door, and embraced the pretty mamma, saying,</p>
               <p>"Oh, I am so glad you have come! Helen has such a dreadful headache!"</p>
               <p>"She has earned it, by some imprudence," said that lady, coolly. "Did you lie
                  awake all night, talking nonsense, as usual?"</p>
               <p>"We talked all our nonsense before ten o'clock, and slept like dormice."</p>
               <p>"Then you walked in the wet, I suppose?" said mamma, shaking a few snowflakes from
                  her boa, and hanging it on the hat-stand.</p>
               <p>"On the contrary, we prudently played a game of battle-dore in the hall."</p>
               <p>"And how did you spend the evening?" pursued the quiet investigator. "Helen's
                  headaches always have a cause. Hang up my hat, dear."</p>
               <p>"Played, sang, and conversed."</p>
               <p>"What was the subject of your conversation?"</p>
               <p>"Beauty, intellect, etc. Helen seemed quite excited."</p>
               <p>"I hope you did not quarrel?" said Mrs. Irving, with a smile, as she ascended the
                  stairs.</p>
               <p>Viola smiled, too—the idea seemed so absurd—"We never do that, you know."</p>
               <p>"She was quite bright and merry, this morning, and arose first, gibing me for my
                  indolence, and asking if I thought my cap becoming, that I was reluctant to lay it
                  aside. Then I arose, and feeling that I had lost time, dressed quickly, and was
                  first ready to descend, upon which we had some further jesting about the race of
                  the hare and tortoise—when I left her. When she came to the breakfast-room, I was
                  busy reading a letter, and did not at first observe her. When I looked up, she sat
                     with<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC5981-00000107"/> her elbows upon the table,
                  holding her head with her hands, and seemed very ill. She has hardly spoken
                  since."</p>
               <p>"You are as minutely circumstantial as if you were giving an account of a murder,"
                  said Mrs. Irving, with a smile. "She will be better, soon, dear, so do not trouble
                  yourself. From whom did you receive news this morning?"</p>
               <p>"Pardon me," she continued, perceiving Viola hesitated; "the question was a
                  careless one."</p>
               <p>"I am quite willing to answer it," said Viola. "My letter was from Cola
                  Conway."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Irving turned upon the landing, and looked at her scrutinizingly. The girl
                  did not blush, as when communicating with Walsingham upon this subject; but, in
                  her usual self-possessed manner, reminded her companion that the passage was cold,
                  and they had better proceed to Helen. Mrs. Irving was busy arranging her shawl,
                  and did not take the hand offered her. She coldly answered, "Yes," and herself led
                  the way.</p>
               <p>For several days Helen kept her room, with that obstinate headache. Now it was
                  intense and blinding, and now drowsy and dull. During all this time a vague sense
                  of misery oppressed her; while her mind, paralyzed by pain, was incapable of
                  reflecting upon or analyzing the cause. When she became able to bear the motion,
                  Mrs. Irving removed her home. But the Helen who returned was unlike the Helen who
                  went forth—she was languid, inert, and abstracted. She would sit with her hands
                  folded in her lap, her eyes fixed upon vacancy, so lost in melancholy musing, that
                  her tender mother's heart ached when she looked at her. That watchful, thoughtful
                  mother knew full well the operations of her child's mind: she longed to gather her
                  to her heart, and with loving remonstrance win her back to cheerfulness; but she
                  desisted, lest it should cause Helen an additional pang to know that her secret
                  had been penetrated even by a mother's love. She hoped, too, that her child would
                  of herself struggle against and conquer the melancholy that oppressed her.</p>
               <p>In sooth it was a dreary household, for the father was still moody, silent, and
                  cold, while the daughter continued languid and spiritless. She resumed the little
                  household duties which were hers, with such evident effort and want of interest,
                  as discouraged the hopeful mother. She, whose youth and joyousness had made the
                  sunlight of the house, was now so sad and silent that those about her felt the
                  influence of her secret sorrow.</p>
               <p>"Why do you pause in your work, Helen? do you not understand the pattern? It is
                  very beautiful," said Mrs. Irving one day, when engaged at needlework with her
                  daughter.</p>
               <p>"Is it?"</p>
               <p>"Is it? Certainly it is. Pansies and lilies of the valley."</p>
               <p>"I did not notice."</p>
               <p>"I was at some pains to select something that would suit your taste, and am sorry
                  my care has been lost upon you," said Mrs. Irving, dryly.</p>
               <p>Helen looked up with wonder in her sad eyes. It was the first reproach that she
                  had heard.</p>
               <pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC5981-00000108"/>
               <p>"I think my daughter has grown indifferent to many things she formerly thought
                  worthy her attention," pursued the mother.</p>
               <p>Tears now sprang to Helen's eyes.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to see," pursued Mrs. Irving, "that you are allowing some fancied evil
                  to poison the enjoyment of real good. Why is it, Helen, that with youth, health,
                  fortune, and loving friends, you permit yourself to be unhappy?"</p>
               <p>No reply being given to this unanswerable question, she continued—</p>
               <p>"I entreat that you will rouse yourself—cast off the melancholy that, while it
                  oppresses you, shadows those who love you."</p>
               <p>"Mother, spare me!"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Irving, who had continued her embroidery while speaking, now laid it down,
                  and looked irresolute. Resisting the impulse to caress and soothe her child, she
                  resumed—</p>
               <p>"It is best, darling, that I should speak. What cause have you for unhappiness,
                  that makes it so impossible for you to recover your mental balance? If the hand of
                  God had dealt to you affliction or bereavement, it would not justify the condition
                  of your mind. Life is not all a holiday—happiness our inheritance and right, that
                  we should find in sorrow an excuse for indifference to the duties, and ingratitude
                  for the blessings of life. When our path lies in sunshine, we should be thankful;
                  when amid storms, patience and endurance become us. Because we have been cherished
                  in the warmth of God's smile, shall we rebel against his frown? But you, my
                  daughter, to whom actual sorrow has never come, cannot even plead that poor excuse
                  for your unhappy frame of mind."</p>
               <p>"Oh, mamma, if you had ever suffered as I, you would pity me."</p>
               <p>"I have had my own sad experiences of life. What are my daughter's, that she
                  thinks they surpass mine?"</p>
               <p>Helen blushed, partly at the selfishness of sorrow, which had caused her to forget
                  that great bereavement under which her mother had borne herself with Christian
                  heroism; partly at the suspicion that hers might be but an ideal sorrow, since she
                  dared not bare it to the scrutiny, nor claim the sympathy, of that calm reasoning,
                  yet tender mother.</p>
               <p>Mothers are said to be impatient of daughters' tender woes. Even those who, in
                  youth, have experienced youth's tribulations, fail to sympathize with those
                  interesting sorrows in their children. It may be, that time, and matrimony, and
                  succeeding affections obliterate the memory of "true love's vicissitudes" in the
                  matron's mind. Mrs. Irving's heart history was simple. She was beloved, responded
                  truly to the affection she inspired, and wedded; ever after, as the fairy tales
                  have it, "living in peace." It may be, that with these limited experiences, she
                  could not fully appreciate her daughter's suffering; and it may be well she did
                  not. Her love for a good child taught her, in some degree, sympathy with a grief
                  she could not fully understand; but so far from treating it with indulgent
                  delicacy, she boldly attacked it with reasons.</p>
               <p>"What are my daughter's griefs, that she thinks they surpass mine?" echoed in
                  Helen's ears. She remembered when<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC5981-00000109"/> death
                  had entered their nursery, and removed the eldest born, and dearest. She recalled
                  the suffering mother's face, bending over her remaining ones in agony, and tears,
                  such as had appalled their wondering little hearts. How her great sorrow shrank
                  into insignificance before a woe so stern and real!</p>
               <p>"Helen, shall there not be confidence between us?"</p>
               <p>She threw herself into her mother's arms, sobbing, "Oh, mother! Good, wise, kind
                  mother, pity me! not my grief more than my folly and weakness. Would that you
                  could look into my heart and read the disquiet that I cannot speak!"</p>
               <p>"You need not, my daughter, I know all;" and folding her in her arms, she suffered
                  her to weep unchecked.</p>
               <p>"Helen," she said, at last, "do you remember the sorrows of childhood, over which
                  your little heart was well nigh broken? You smile at them now! They seem so
                  pretty, and tender, and pleasant to remember. They impart such dignity and
                  piquancy to childhood, that 'tis oftenest through them childhood is recalled. The
                  first grief of youth has befallen you now, and youth's energies are well nigh
                  crushed thereby: your matured womanhood will smile at this girlish grief, as
                  girlhood now looks back upon childish ills. As your path winds downward through
                  the future, cares and sorrows will beset it, such as would appal these bright
                  young years; but if I read my daughter's character aright, she will grow strong
                  with her necessities; and hereafter bear with brave submission, burdens, compared
                  with which the sorrow under which she is now sinking will seem light. And in the
                  hereafter it must be, that the soul blessed in Paradise, will look back upon the
                  great tribulations of humanity through which she has passed, with the same serene
                  and smiling contemplation that she, while in the flesh, accorded to sorrows above
                  which she rose superior."</p>
               <p>As these loving women sat together thus talking, twilight came down, and still
                  their soft voices murmured through its tender shadow like the song of waves at
                  night.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">DISQUIET.</head>
               <p>HELEN'S secret grief seemed lighter, since it was shared by another, and she
                  became once more cheerful. Her household duties were resumed; music again breathed
                  through her home, and smiles wreathed her lip. But the smile was faint and quiet,
                  the music sad, and the accustomed avocations performed with a calmer, graver
                  grace.</p>
               <p>It was the custom of this humble-hearted girl to sit in severe judgment upon
                  herself; and, in the present instance, she bitterly reproached what she considered
                  the arrogant vanity that had given a significance to Cola's attentions to herself
                  which they did not merit; and had permitted her to believe that she possessed any
                  charm sufficiently potent to attract one exposed to the counter influence of
                  Viola's loveliness. But as she recalled all that had passed between herself and
                  the volatile object of her regard, she could not, with all her humility, exonerate
                  him from blame. She slowly began to fear that this <emph>paragon,</emph> this
                  perfect model of manhood hood, this incarnation of adorable virtues, had, while
                  acting the lover to herself, and the friend to her brother, been false to both.
                  That, however handsome and brilliant he might be, he lacked those high-toned
                  principles which she had credulously attributed to him, and without which more
                  showy gifts are worthless.</p>
               <p>There was an added grief in this thought to Helen. The belief that she had loved
                  unwisely had stricken her heart, but the bolt seemed barbed by the conviction that
                  she loved unworthily. She felt—this pure-hearted young idolater—that she could
                  have resigned to the cold keeping of the charnel, or the warm arms of another, the
                  man whom love had deified, if he had passed thus from her hope, with the glorious
                  attributes with which believing love had endowed him, unshadowed. She could have
                  exulted in having loved him then, and been happier in her desolation, with her
                  holy memories about her, than in the full fruition of a grosser love.</p>
               <p>In loving truth, in revering virtue, in striving after perfection, she still could
                  have indulged her love for him who had been to her young spirit the embodiment of
                  these. But alas, alas! The god was unshrined, and the worshipper must become an
                  iconoclast.</p>
               <p>In her own grief her sympathies were quick for others. For Viola, whom she loved
                  through the dangerous test of a successful rivalship—Viola, before whose delicate
                  perceptions of right the double lover would stand dishonoured—Viola, stronger and
                  prouder than herself, who, when she came to know him, would<pb n="220-221"

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And for Howard! While submitting to her own bitter blight with patience, she
                  thought of his probable disappointment with a tincture of his own rebellion. How
                  was this imperious and unthwarted boy to bear being crossed in his master passion;
                  and by the treachery of the friend he trusted? Her heart quaked, and, in the
                  thought of his stormy grief, she forgot her own.</p>
               <p>Sometimes ingenious and charitable hope beguiled her, reconciling all that was
                  contradictory in Cola's conduct, and making his acts harmonize with friendship,
                  honour, and good faith. What was there so hopelessly condemning in the evidence of
                  that letter? He might merely have sent Viola a copy of some literary curiosity
                  from the college library. This would have been natural and like him, and, above
                  all, was acceptable to belief.</p>
               <p>The glow of pleasure which such thought called to her cheek quickly faded, as she
                  reflected with what ready confidence Viola would have shared a communication of
                  that kind with her, instead of folding it in silence, as though laying a secret
                  between its leaves, looking so triumphant in beauty and happiness the while. At
                  the remembrance her heart bled afresh—that hapless heart, within whose silent
                  borders hope and fear perpetually conflicted.</p>
               <p>From the moment that Walsingham was convinced that Viola loved, there was an inner
                  voice ever saying, "<emph>lost! lost!</emph>" The dim image of one who was to rob
                  him of the joy of life, that had so long stood threateningly in the distance, now
                  drew near, and assumed a tangible shape. He did not inquire into, or resist the
                  girlish will that smilingly crushed out his hope, but systematically preferred her
                  wishes and happiness to his own.</p>
               <p>How disciplined had the heart of this noble man become since its first trial! That
                  early love, so far back in the past, had been but the desire of sentimental youth
                  for its vision of beauty—this was the full-grown passion of matured and earnest
                  manhood. Yet to the first he succumbed, sacrificing the promise and flush of
                  youth; with the last, albeit deeper and stronger, he grappled bravely, matching
                  passion with strong will, and high resolve for the sake of her who smiled in
                  unconscious happiness beside his hearthstone.</p>
               <p>Viola, as though in very mockery of the heartaches she caused, seemed childishly
                  happy. She laughed, danced, and sang with an exuberant joy that caused Mrs. Grey
                  to declare, for her part, she liked not such mirth, having noticed that those who
                  laugh in the new moon must weep in the old; and Jim Crow, with his own diabolical
                  solemnity, stalked near her like an evil portent.</p>
               <p>Howard, in the mean time, dreamed love-dreams over his books, which always ended
                  happily, or wrote love verses that were unhappily marred; and so the Christmas
                  Holidays drew nigh.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIX.</head>
               <head type="sub">A SURPRISE.</head>
               <p>THE weather was now inclement, and Viola was often a prisoner within doors; but
                  this was no privation to one for whom life in all its phases mantled with
                  pleasure. The same warm fancy that in childhood filled the forest of the Bluff
                  with enchantments was with her still, peopling the wintry solitude with its
                  creations.</p>
               <p>Walsingham made frequent excursions to the village. From one of these he returned
                  with a package of books. "There," he said, handing a volume to Viola, "is a
                  romance for you."</p>
               <p>"Romance!" she exclaimed, examining the title, "why this is history."</p>
               <p>"Can it not be both?" he asked, tearing the envelopes from his books, one by
                  one.</p>
               <p>"No," she answered quickly, "because one is a narration of facts, and the other of
                  fiction."</p>
               <p>He looked up suddenly, and smiled. "You are well booked in your meanings; but
                  cannot a skeleton of fact be draped in fiction?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly it can; but what it gains in romance, it loses in its integrity of
                  history."</p>
               <p>"Not necessarily so," said he, pushing the books away, and turning toward her.
                  "These cold remains of facts, exhumed from the dust of ages, are but the skeletons
                  of things past. They have lost, in the decay of time, those minor circumstances
                  that filled their outline to roundness. They have lost the busy thought that
                  inspired, the warm passion that animated, and have become repulsive and unfaithful
                  images of things that were. Let the imagination of the historian reproduce the
                  semblance of what they have lost; let his fancies reanimate, his probabilities
                  drape, and they once more grow life-like. They are not more real than before, but
                  they are so brought within the range of our sympathies that they seem so, and
                  conjecture wins that attention, nay, credence for truth, that truth failed to
                  command."</p>
               <p>"It is still conjecture, and not truth. Fiction, and not fact."</p>
               <p>"I am not willing to admit that. Human nature is the same in all ages, and with
                  suitable data may not its movements be calculated with mathematical accuracy by
                  those philosophers who have made man their study? The course of comets in their
                  orbits is conjectured with unerring certainty."</p>
               <p>Viola laughed, and so did her guardian. "Your theory pleases me much, but it is
                  the converse of what you have heretofore urged; I, in stoutly maintaining the
                  distinction between<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC5981-00000113"/> tween fact and
                  fiction, have only endeavoured to do justice to your previous teaching, but I
                  shall say with Katherine— <q>

                  </q> "And I have learned my later theory from you; thus, you see, we teach each

               <p>"From me?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; from reflecting upon the character of your mind, and observing its
                  operations. You would be an imaginative historian, but not an unfaithful one. Do
                  you remember the blind beggar that came out of Farmer Goodman's door, as you and
                  Mrs. Grey drove down the road?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; but what has he to do with history?"</p>
               <p>"He illustrates different styles of history. Mrs. Grey said that 'the women folks
                  came out and stared after him as far as they could see,' which was naked fact. You
                  told me, 'and those two compassionate women followed him to the door, and watched
                  him with sorrow in their hearts.' This was fact adorned by fancy. You did but
                  conjecture the compassion and sorrow, yet conjectured accurately, knowing what
                  were the natural emotions of the female heart."</p>
               <p>"I think," he continued, gathering up his books to depart, "that you will like the
                  Historical Fragment I have selected for you. It is a correct chronicle of the
                  times it purports to portray, while a certain richness of fancy gives tone to the
                  whole."</p>
               <p>Viola drew an arm-chair to the fire, and nestling in its depths, abandoned herself
                  to the enjoyment of her book. It was a glowing chronicle of the crusades—to a
                  lively imagination, such as hers, an actual panorama of that wonderful and
                  eventful era in the world's history. Absorbed in the narrative, she grew oblivious
                  to actual things, and stood in the presence of kings, warriors, knights, ladies,
                  and troubadours. The four walls that enclosed her, faded; time's vast vista spread
                  before her; those who had marked the years with their deeds were again engaged in
                  the drama of nations.</p>
               <p>Suddenly, intruding upon the gorgeous vision, a rough, weather-beaten face peered
                  curiously into her own.</p>
               <p>The valor of departed heroes did not animate her heart. With a shriek of alarm and
                  surprise, she leaped from her seat, and would have fled, but for the stout grasp
                  that held her.</p>
               <p>Sick with terror, her eyes closed; when Walsingham, hearing her shriek, came to
                  the rescue. He released the frightened girl and hurled the intruder from him.</p>
               <p>Viola clung to her guardian, half fainting, and again his heart throbbed wildly as
                  he clasped her. She had flown to his bosom like a frightened dove, and the vain
                  wish arose that it had been her chosen refuge from all the ills of life.</p>
               <p>"Welcome home!" growled the gruff intruder. "I suppose that's what all this means;
                  but hang me at the yard-arm if I can interpret in this port. Timbuctoo is plain
                  English along side o' that!"</p>
               <p>"Heavens, Ben!" exclaimed Walsingham, "is it you? Look up, Viola, and welcome your
                  uncle Captain!"</p>
               <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC5981-00000114"/>
               <p>"If this gimcrack is of any use, it will tell me why my own brother has forgotten
                  me," continued the indignant and ill-used Captain, squaring himself before the
                  mirror.</p>
               <p>Viola saw that the worthy gentleman felt aggrieved; and between nervous agitation
                  and vexation, she was about bursting into tears. Fortunately she resisted a
                  weakness which, if indulged, would have condemned her in his estimation utterly;
                  and taking both his brown hands in her own, she kissed his cheek, saying, "Welcome
                  home, Uncle Captain, and pray forgive my foolish fright. No one has cared to make
                  a brave girl of me, while you were gone."</p>
               <p>Whether it was the look, the voice, the kiss, or the covert flattery, that
                  thrilled the sailor's heart and charmed away his impatience, this chronicler
                  recordeth not, but he warmly embraced her, saying,</p>
               <p>"Why, now, you are a brave girl still in an open sea, I believe. But if you mope
                  over such trumpery as that, you will grow as nervous as the dowager Duchess of
                  Diddledum;" and he gave the fallen book a kick, expressive of contempt.</p>
               <p>"So be it with them all, now that I have come, for I always hated them, and most
                  of all in a woman's hand. Show me a book while I'm here, and I'll be tempted to
                  burn it."</p>
               <p>"I hope not, Uncle Captain," said Viola, laughing, "for when you are away they are
                  my best friends."</p>
               <p>"And I hope not, too," said Walsingham, "for they are our best friends
                  always."</p>
               <p>"Look at that, now!" quoth the Captain, "and see how books pervert a fine nature.
                  There was a time when he would have ranked us first, Viola."</p>
               <p>"If you or Viola should be jealous of my mute companions, it will be because you
                  do not understand how much I value you."</p>
               <p>"Uncle Captain, those horrid wrappings disguise you so much, that I have not
                  recognised you yet. Come to your own old room, and make yourself like yourself,
                  and then tell us of your travels."</p>
               <p>Uncle Captain prepared to depart, in accordance with this invitation, when,
                  measuring with his eye the young lady's altitude, he asseverated,—"By Juno! if he
                  had seen her looking so like Juno's self, when first he came, he should have
                  bowed, and scraped, and made a fool of himself.</p>
               <p>"But when I saw you," he continued, "curled up among the cushions, like a lady's
                  lap-dog, with your sweet little face peering out from its curls, I caught you in
                  my arms, thinking this is the blessed child again. But, alack-a-day! you are no
                  child now, and young ladies are my aversion."</p>
               <p>"I shall make a vow to redeem the race in your estimation, or undo all that time
                  has done for me; and, in the mean time, pray treat me as your pet of old, if you
                  don't intend to break my heart."</p>
               <p>Thus talking, they left the room together, and Walsingham looked after them in
                  surprise. In Viola's deportment to the Captain there was a familar <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">enfant gaté</foreign> air that he had never observed in her
                  before. He could not say that it did not become her, and the old tar was evidently
                  charmed by it; but<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC5981-00000115"/> her timid deference
                  to himself, her modest hesitation in approaching him, was a thousand times more
                  beautiful, he thought. She had kissed the Captain, too; but had never, since
                  childhood, offered him that token of regard. This difference of manner toward
                  these gentlemen was an insensible reflection of their respective characters—the
                  Captain being hearty, cordial, and free, while his brother was fastidious and
                  reserved.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXX.</head>
               <head type="sub">CONTINUED ARRIVALS.</head>
               <p>NOW the holidays were at hand, and every one prepared to meet them with holiday
                  cheer. The Captain declared he had not met St. Nick on land for ten years, and he
                  meant to have a jolly blow-out. Walsingham looked forward with a quiet pleasure to
                  his annual excuse for lavishing gifts upon his darling. Mrs. Irving expected to
                  welcome home her best beloved, her idol, her handsome, spirited, spoiled boy,
                  while her husband, with a father's pride and pleasure, would mark the maturing
                  promise of him who should fill his place, and shoulder the burdens of life when he
                  should lay them down.</p>
               <p>Viola's strange delirium of happiness could not well be augmented; while Helen,
                  poor sad Helen, shrank from the approaching festivities. The ordinary requirements
                  of daily life she had disciplined herself to meet; but to vest her thought in
                  holiday garb, to ask a song of her heart in its sadness, was more than she was
                  able to do.</p>
               <p>How sad is the approach of a festival to the mourning heart! It shrinks as from an
                  advancing foe. Nothing can<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC5981-00000116"/> add a keener
                  pang to grief than the unsympathizing aspect of nature. She pauses not to comfort
                  her suffering children, but moves in her appointed sphere, and with her wonted
                  majesty, over the griefs of a household or the graves of empires. The stars rise
                  and set, unmoved by our joys, untouched by our sorrows. The seasons advance and
                  retire, unmindful of one welcome less, or one grave more.</p>
               <p>Blessed are they who can look beyond the calm, unsympathizing skies, and say, God
                  sees! God pities!</p>
               <p>"Cola is a splendid fellow, is he not?" wrote the unconscious Howard to his
                  sister. "He is the most popular man in college, and the girls are all in love with
                  him. He is called the "king of hearts," and a regular trump! I believe the dog has
                  a dozen invitations for the holidays; but he prefers a slice of mamma's turkey,
                  and a wedge of your mince pie, to the finest spread in Christendom. To confess an
                  absurd jealousy, I did not intend to bring him home with me, for reasons which you
                  will probably appreciate (under certain circumstances one does not like to be
                  overshadowed); but the poor fellow asked me, in the coolest possible way, if he
                  had not been invited; and I told him, if he would promise to be only moderately
                  agreeable, he might pack his trunk. So bid mamma make ready to welcome us."</p>
               <p>Upon this epistle being submitted to mamma, she wrote to her son that in
                  consequence of other invitations for the holidays, it would be out of her power to
                  receive his friend. This inhospitable letter passing the young gentlemen on their
                  route, failed to interfere with their plans.</p>
               <p>And onward the frosty Christmas came, neither hastening for the eager, or pausing
                  for the unwilling. A deep snow had fallen the week before, and the Bluff, like a
                  hoary Titan, reared its front above ice-bound river and drifted valley. The air
                  was filled with the music of bells; the river covered with skaters; missiles of
                  snow flew like sugar-plums in Carnival time, and coasting was as fashionable among
                  the rustics of the Susquehanna as at the court of St. Petersburg.</p>
               <p>The Captain romped and roared, like Boreas let loose, and insisted upon the minute
                  observance of Christmas ceremonials. With his own hand he lopped the redundant
                  branches of mountain evergreens to decorate the house. Mirrors, pictures, and
                  brackets were hung with wreaths—boughs filled the vacant corners, and the Eyrie
                  looked like a sylvan lodge.</p>
               <p>In accordance with this boyish gentleman's views, the stocking ceremonial was
                  observed. Viola's silken hose grew plethoric with corals from the Mediterranean,
                  mosaics from Florence, cameos from Rome, and uncut gems, gathered by the Captain's
                  hand in their native valleys, waiting for their lady's fancy and the lapidary's
                  art to develope their latent brilliancy. Mrs. Grey's knitted stocking of home-made
                  thread was pressed into the chimney service, albeit against the will of its
                  respectable owner, and served to transmit to that worthy dame a watch of capacious
                  dimensions, insidiously intended to usurp the <emph>time</emph>-honoured kitchen
                  clock in her affections.</p>
               <p>It may be remarked, in passing, that it failed of its mission; the good lady never
                  remembering to wind it oftener than once a week. That duty being performed with
                     exact<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC5981-00000117"/> regularity on Saturday night
                  at ten o'clock, the chronometer graced her girdle on Sunday, and was honoured with
                  confidences and consultations throughout the holy day. But on Monday, being silent
                  and dumb, and treacherously misleading its mistress when appealed to, it was
                  consigned to limbo, and Mrs. Grey, for the rest of the week, might be seen in
                  transit, from one haunt to another, with the clock under her arm, as usual.</p>
               <p>Nor was Jim Crow forgotten. A glove of his own pilfering was drawn from its
                  hiding-place, and hung up on his behalf. Viola filled it with bonbons, to which
                  treasure of tinsel and sweets he seemed profoundly indifferent. But upon their
                  being removed to the pantry, the nefarious little wretch took great delight in
                  filching them upon every opportunity, believing them to be contraband.</p>
               <p>While these Christmas Eve observances were receiving their due in the Eyrie, the
                  Irvings were watching for the coach which was to deposit Howard at the gate. How
                  pretty, and attractive, and fairy-like that home looked, with its luxurious
                  appointments, its festive decorations, its genial fireside, and its sweet, loving,
                  welcoming women! Mrs. Irving's thoughts and cares seemed to oscillate between the
                  crowded coach, dragging along the wintry road, and the bountiful supper that
                  bubbled and squeaked by her kitchen fire.</p>
               <p>"Poor fellow!" she would say, "what a long, comfortless ride he is having! I
                  wonder if Macey's cakes are light?" or—</p>
               <p>"I fear he will be half-frozen, and the chicken overdone! Poor Howard! he was
                  always hungry!" and she smiled such a proud smile, as though it was the happiest
                  thing in life to be the mother of a hungry son. Often she placed her hand against
                  the window-pane, to shut from her sight the warmth and light of that cheerful
                  room, and gazed down into the darkness of the winter night, hoping to catch the
                  first glimpse of the vehicle which carried—<emph>her Cæsar;</emph> then
                  disappearing from the room for a space, would return, wafting such savoury odours
                  from her garments as caused George Irving to lay aside his book, sniff the air,
                  and wish, with all his hungry heart, the coach would come.</p>
               <p>"Tra-la-la—tra-la-la!" smote the sharp air, and the coach was at the gate. Mr.
                  Irving took his hat, and went forth to welcome his son, while the mother and Helen
                  peered from the hall-door, endeavouring to distinguish in the group around the
                  vehicle, the form of their expected brother and son. It was clear, sparkling, and
                  frosty without; the coachmen and passenges were closely muffled, and spoke with
                  thick, chilled voices, yet cheerily; for were they not all going where Christmas
                  welcome and Christmas cheer awaited them? And at the sight of those fair women,
                  waiting in their warmed and lighted hall to embrace their clever fellow-traveller,
                  did they not think of others as fair elsewhere, whose hearts would gladden at
                  their coming, and whose welcome would be as sweet and warm?</p>
               <p>Suddenly, Helen grew very pale, and grasped Mrs. Irving's arm, exclaiming,
                     "<emph>Mother!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Don't be so excited, my love; keep calm."</p>
               <p>"Mother, <emph>he</emph> has come!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, dear; Howard."</p>
               <pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC5981-00000118"/>
               <p>"No! <emph>that other!</emph> I would know his step and voice among a
                  thousand!"</p>
               <p>"He dare not intrude, after what I have written."</p>
               <p>"Hush, mother, I implore you, he is here. Welcome him, if you would not humiliate
                  me."</p>
               <p>"But you, my darling"—</p>
               <p>"I will not betray myself."</p>
               <p>"Mother, hurrah! here we are! how handsome you look! Kiss me, Helen—there, don't
                  cling so to me, but shake hands with Cola."</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>The Christmas dinner at Mrs. Irving's was by no means a model of what such things
                  should be. That usually hospitable lady was embarrassed by the presence of an
                  unwelcome guest, and perturbed by the unnecessary trial imposed upon her
                  daughter.</p>
               <p>Helen, usually calm and quiet, was boisterously gay; while Cola, with those nice
                  perceptions which often pierce conventional disguises, felt that his presence was
                  unlooked for and unwelcome. Guilty fellow, did he know why? Howard, having been
                  used to consider himself of more importance than any other member of the social
                  circle, was, in the present instance, too much occupied with his own thoughts, and
                  plans, to observe that there was much amiss with others. Having in view a
                  horseback ride to the Eyrie, after dinner, he thought that meal unusually long and
                  dull; wondered why his sister laughed so much at her own speeches, and why mother
                  was so stiff and cold; felt glad that father entertained his chum with a long
                  discourse upon timber lands, to which that young gentleman did seriously incline;
                  and, finally, when the ladies withdrew, muttered something about "engagement," and
                  ran off to the stables, leaving the two gentlemen to their nuts and wine.</p>
               <p>As the young man rode up the mountain, he pictured Viola to himself; fancying how
                  she would look, what she would say, etc. In all these vagaries of the imagination
                  she seemed so full of grace and beauty, so unlike the duller realities of flesh
                  and blood, that at the door he stayed his hand, fearing to dissipate his visions
                  by a reality less lovely.</p>
               <p>Radiant and beautiful Viola! When she did appear, her lover was transfixed with
                  enchanted surprise, so far did the warm, breathing, blushing, smiling woman
                  outcharm his dim ideal.</p>
               <p>The Captain, and Walsingham, welcomed him in their respective styles; and for
                  their entertainment, it is to be presumed; inasmuch as he addressed himself to
                  them, he discoursed most learnedly, fluently, and brilliantly upon various
                  intellectual achievements within college precincts, the heroes of which would
                  certainly electrify the world.</p>
               <p>"Pshaw!" said the Captain, testily; "I've seen such things in my time, but what
                  does it all amount to? These college bred geniuses are like hot-house plants. With
                  a genial atmosphere and careful culture they put forth shoots and blossoms
                  wondrously; but transplanted into the great garden of the world, they dwindle,
                  wither, and are at last overshadowed by the rank growth of hardy and natural
                  vegetation. If I had a son, sir, I would not shut him up with Greek and Latin
                     for<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC5981-00000119"/> twenty years, and then turn him
                  loose upon the great striving world to seek his bread. I would let his youth, be
                  an apprenticeship to the battle of life. He should struggle up to manhood as he
                  must struggle through it, becoming stronger, with striving, and growing higher, as
                  competitors hedged him in."</p>
               <p>"But, Captain," argued the young man, "the world is filled with maturity,
                  experience, and wisdom; would you bid the untried energies of youth cope with
                  these? The discouragements of an unequal contest palsy our best energies. The
                  college is an intellectual arena, where the athlete meet on fair and equal terms.
                  The student's is a life of competition; and he who would triumph in the contest
                  must put forth all his mental strength."</p>
               <p>"Pshaw! the forest is filled with oaks, yet the indomitable vine clambers on their
                  shoulders to the sunlight. What are your college contests on visionary
                  battle-fields? Ye are children of the earth, and like your great elder brother can
                  only grow strong when your feet are planted on her bosom."</p>
               <p>"Walsingham, to the rescue!" cried the young champion, laughing, "and vindicate
                  your <foreign xml:lang="LAT">alma mater.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"Come forward, Arthur Walsingham, that I may show this young man a living
                  illustration of what I have said. There, is a man, who was the pride of his class,
                  and for whom the greatest honours of the world were predicted; yet he sits by his
                  fireside to-night, with no more reputation than those stupid citizens who never
                  felt the glow of ambition or the throes of genius."</p>
               <p>"Can it be possible you do not know? But I forget; you have been long upon the
                  seas, and Mr. Walsingham has been too modest to tell you."</p>
               <p>"Tell me what?"</p>
               <p>"That he is one of the most distinguished men in the country, sir."</p>
               <p>"Who? Arthur Walsingham!"</p>
               <p>"By George, sir, I am proud to be the first to tell you! You should hear our
                  professors talk of him! Why, the scientific world is mad about his books. They are
                  considered of the greatest practical value."</p>
               <p>A slight flush mantled the silent scholar's face as he turned to look at Viola.
                  Her eyes met his with such a kindling and exultant glance as thrilled him to the
                  soul with a strange triumph.</p>
               <p>She would be proud of him! She would value the fame which had crowned his nights
                  of vigil and days of labour.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>She</emph> might one day glory in the knowledge that the man whom the world
                  honoured had laid his great heart at her feet.</p>
               <p>"Hang your modesty!" cried the Captain, with tears in his eyes, as he wrung the
                  hand of Walsingham; "why couldn't you tell me this?"</p>
               <p>"How could I pronounce myself a man of reputation, brother? Fame must announce
                  itself. When I make a noise in the world you will hear it."</p>
               <p>"Come along, come along!" said the excited Captain, going to the door. "Come to
                  that confounded study of yours, and get me your treatises directly, and I'll show
                  you I have not forgotten how to read. Come, I say."</p>
               <pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC5981-00000120"/>
               <p>"Don't trust him with them!" cried Viola to her guardian. "You know, he said if we
                  showed him a book he would burn it."</p>
               <p>As the door closed upon their retreating figures, Howard congratulated himself
                  upon the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coup de main</foreign> by which he had ended an
                  argument, disposed of both brothers, and secured a tête-à-tête with Viola. "Let
                  not him boast that putteth on his harness, but him that putteth it off!"</p>

               <p>A DANGEROUS evening was that which Howard passed with the lady of his heart. She
                  was so interesting in conversation, so beautiful when silent, that, whether she
                  spoke or listened, her lover admired her equally. He felt, as only such natures as
                  his can feel under the influence of youthful passion; and was momentarily on the
                  point of revealing his feelings. Viola's manner was so kind and cordial, it almost
                  seemed to invite the candour in which he longed to indulge.</p>
               <p>Walsingham had ordered his horse to the stables when he arrived, and insisted upon
                  his spending the night at the Eyrie. So, when the silvery-tongued or-molu
                  time-piece announced that the most delicious evening of his life had ended, and it
                  was now proper he should seek his chamber, he<pb n="240-241"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000121"/> bade Viola good-night, as though pronouncing a
                  benediction, and walked from the room, as Adam might have turned from Paradise,
                  had he been driven forth companionless. His great-coat hung in the hall, and, as
                  he flung it over his arm, he remembered a gift in its pocket for Viola. He
                  returned at once to her, and presented it with stammering and awkwardness.</p>
               <p>I am not sure that Viola knew what she said in reply. She changed colour, and was
                  as confused and incoherent as himself. The donor understood, however, that she
                  would decline his gift as soon as she could find words sufficiently gracious for
                  the ungracious act. He deprecated her refusal with—</p>
               <p>"You are so associated with my mother and sister, that in making such selections
                  as I thought would please them, I could not help including you. I hope you will
                  not, by refusing my gift, make me feel that I have taken a liberty."</p>
               <p>"You are very good," said Viola, "but—"</p>
               <p>"Nay, listen to me first. It is a cherished wish of mine that you should possess
                  some trifle that may speak of me when absent. Something that may stand like a
                  sentinel by your side and guard your thoughts, bringing them back to me when they
                  would wander."</p>
               <p>Viola bit her lip, as she bent over the exquisite ebony work-box inlaid with
                  silver.</p>
               <p>"I do not require such mementos of my friends. This is very beautiful—too
                  beautiful for such a sad idler as I am Give it to Helen, who will make better use
                  of it."</p>
               <p>"You refuse my gift!" said he, bitterly.</p>
               <p>"Nay, Howard," she said, recovering her winning manner, "I will not suffer you to
                  be offended. Give me a book that we have read together; a flower that we have
                  mutually admired, and I will treasure it as the gift of a valued friend. It will
                  speak more eloquently of you, than this faithless messenger, which is too
                  beautiful to suggest anything beyond its own exquisite self. Besides, what have we
                  in common with a work-box?"</p>
               <p>"Viola, you mock me!" exclaimed the half mollified lover. "Why will you not treat
                  me with candour?"</p>
               <p>"That is precisely what I would like to do, if I dared!" she said, laughing.</p>
               <p>More offended than ever, he walked to the window and gazed savagely at the
                  reflection of himself in the panes.</p>
               <p>Viola watched her sulking lover, first with a smile, then a frown, and lastly with
                  a grave perplexed air. Finally, with a sudden resolution, she spoke:—</p>
               <p>"The promptitude with which you take offence, discourages candour; yet I will
                  speak frankly to you, as to a friend and brother, beseeching a patient
                  hearing."</p>
               <p>Struck by the grave, kind confidence of her tones, he turned from the window to
                  listen, and she proceeded:—</p>
               <p>"Candidly, then, I do not accept this costly gift from you, because I fear to
                  offend against the proprieties of life. Nay, be patient! I have never had a mother
                  to teach me these: my own woman's instinct, and the example of your dear mother,
                  have been my only guides. If I am too fastidious, rejoice, as a true friend
                  should, that 'tis on that extreme, I err.<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC5981-00000122"
                  /> Believe me, Howard" (and she gave him her hand, and smiled frankly in his
                  face), "I am truly grateful for your remembrance of me, and I do not need a
                  prompter to bring you to my mind. Now are we friends?"</p>
               <p>It was not in adamant to resist her! He was charmed by the simplicity and apparent
                  candour of this half explanation, half appeal. "I would not have you other than
                  you are," he said, "yet I do not see how we can be friends, if you persist in
                  refusing a Christmas token from me."</p>
               <p>"I will not, but let it be this;" and she took from the table his copy of Corinne,
                  which they had been reading together.</p>
               <p>Now, of all Howard's possessions, this was the most valued, because every page
                  breathed of Viola. Over this passage she had warmed with beautiful enthusiasm, and
                  paused to speak such eloquent comments as thrilled her lover's heart. To that she
                  had lent "the beauty of her voice;" and, in his mind, voice and sentiment were for
                  ever wedded. The book was eloquent with memories of Viola, <emph>his
                     Corinne!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>A glad hope flashed on his heart that she, too, might remember with tenderness the
                  hours they had spent together over those enchanting pages. He looked at her with
                  sudden scrutiny as she stood with the book in her hand, and her face upturned to
                  his. He felt convinced that she could not but respond to his passion; that the
                  treasured volume must have for his beloved, associations as fond as his own.</p>
               <p>His face kindled with this belief, as he exclaimed, "Will you indeed accept it?
                  How proud shall I be to surrender to you one of my greatest treasures!" As he
                  stood by her side, flushed with pleasure, eager to say more, yet afraid to break
                  the delicious spell, he perceived on the small fingers that clasped the book, the
                  sparkle of a strange jewel. A basilisk's eye could not have been more terrible in
                  its gleam, for he recognised the ring as one of Conway's recent purchases. A gift
                  accepted from his friend, while his own offering had been rejected!</p>
               <p>With the frantic impulse of one mad with contending passions, he snatched Corinne
                  from her hand, and, flinging it in the fire, rushed to the stables for his
                  horse.</p>
               <p>The wildest passions possessed him as he galloped down the frozen mountain. The
                  revulsion, from an ecstasy of hope, to jealous rage, was terrible. He muttered to
                  the winds fierce imprecations upon the faithless Conway, who had received his
                  confidence, only to betray it. Who, enjoying his friendship and hospitality, had
                  insinuated himself into the heart of his beloved. And Viola's assumed candour, her
                  affected fastidiousness, and fatal beauty! His affections were suddenly bankrupt.
                  He had lost his beloved; lost his friend; and with them, had lost trust in his
                  kind, belief in goodness or truth. The world was to him a moral chaos.</p>
               <p>A storm of snow was falling, and the night was dark, but down the dangerous
                  mountain, and through the whitened valley, galloped the impetuous rider, taking a
                  strange comfort in whistling wind and blinding snow, and all the savage
                  accompaniments of winter's night and storm.</p>
               <p>Over the bridge—past his own gate—through the slumber<pb n="244-245"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000123"/> ing village—clattered his horse's hoofs—on—on—no
                  matter whither!</p>
               <p>His fierceness became gradually soothed by the rugged sympathies of nature. The
                  contention of elements stormed down, the tempest in his soul at last; and,
                  exhausted with his wild ride, and wilder excitement, he turned his horse toward
                  home, now miles away. The gray of morning looked through the falling flakes as he
                  drew his rein at his own door. Reaction is the handmaid of passion; and, when he
                  threw his storm-beaten, storm-racked frame upon his couch, a repose came over him
                  as absolute as death.</p>
               <p>Howard had always loved with confidence. Never having been thwarted, the
                  possibility of disappointment had never seriously presented itself to his mind.
                  Love like his, he argued, must <emph>command</emph> a response. When he awoke with
                  a heavy and dull consciousness of distress, these feelings again possessed him,
                  and reasoned against his new convictions. She who had been so well beloved,
                     <emph>must</emph> love in return. Nor would Cola, light, fearless, and
                  unreflecting as he was, <emph>dare</emph> to tamper with the affections of Viola.
                     <emph>He</emph> love her! He who was in love with every new moon, and attracted
                  by any novel grace! Could <emph>his</emph> paltry, fickle, fleeting fancies defeat
                  the fixed purpose and love of a lifetime? It was too monstrous for belief, and
                  there must be some solution of the circumstances that had so moved him.
                  Perhaps—oh, flattering suggestion of hope!—perhaps she had accepted Cola's gift,
                  knowing it to be the simple offering of friendship, and hesitated to receive his
                  own, with a delicate and maidenly consciousness that it was the token of a deeper
                  passion.</p>
               <p>This hope grew into conviction when he again saw Viola. She came through all the
                  storm with Walsingham, to dine with them that day.</p>
               <p>"You did not expect me, did you?" she said, shaking her damp ringlets. "The
                  gentlemen almost exercised compulsion to keep me at home; but I was sick to see
                  you, Helen, so in spite of difficulties, here I am."</p>
               <p>Howard glanced at the white hands wringing the moisture from her hair, and saw
                  that the ring <emph>was not there.</emph> With a sudden impulse of repentance he
                  offered her his hand, inquiring, "What greeting have you for me, Viola?"</p>
               <p>"Such as you deserve," she answered, laying her hand in his, with a smile so
                  bright that he felt she could not estimate his deserts as small, while bestowing
                  such guerdon.</p>
               <p>The storm grew furious, turning first to sleet, and afterward to rain, rendering
                  Viola's return impossible. Her presence was acceptable to all; even Helen feeling
                  that it destroyed the constraint of their awkward family party. To Howard she was
                  so kind and conciliatory that he felt himself to be forgiven; and giving the most
                  favourable interpretation to her manner, this sanguine lover abandoned himself to
                  the intoxication of her presence.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the placid Cola, undisturbed by Howard's monopoly of Viola's
                  society, seemed quite content with Helen's. He told stories, recited poetry, and
                  perpetrated waggeries for her entertainment, to all of which she did most gravely
                     incline.<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC5981-00000124"/> He sang songs, among which
                  may be named, "How happy could I be with either;" and, something like "When the
                  one we love is away."</p>
               <p>At the conclusion of these appropriate selections he was somewhat abashed to find
                  Miss Helen apparently absorbed in the last Annual; but he quickly rallied, and
                  importuned her for a song. She laid aside her book, and with a cold, grave air
                  took her seat at the instrument, while he heaped coals of fire upon her head by
                  the devotion of his attention.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Irving and Walsingham, while politely discoursing together, each gave an
                  observant eye toward the movements of the young people. The partial mother saw
                  much to modify her displeasure at Cola. She persuaded herself that whatever his
                  offences might have been, he was at least sincere in his love for her daughter.
                  Howard's feelings toward Viola were too apparent to admit of doubt, and it could
                  not be possible, she thought, for that or any other young lady to regard him with
                  indifference, so that however entangled and confused the affairs of these young
                  people might be, she hoped they were slowly unravelling themselves to a
                  satisfactory denouement. Walsingham's convictions were somewhat like her own, but
                  less agreeable. He observed, with grave displeasure, the indifference of Cola to
                  his beautiful ward, and his attentions to Helen; and he felt that this light,
                  trifling, unstable boy was incapable of estimating the value of the pearl he had
                  won.</p>
               <p>In his new character of Viola's lover, Walsingham observed him with closer
                  scrutiny, and he felt a pang as unselfish as it was poignant, that a high-spirited
                  nature, such as hers, should have fastened its affections upon a man like
                  Conway.</p>
               <p>He was brilliant, but superficial, and mentally inferior to the woman who loved
                  him. He watched the play of bright intelligence and quick emotion upon Viola's
                  face, and wondered if she with her gifts, her cultivation, and her devotion, was
                  destined for nothing better than to be the toy of this boy!</p>
               <p>He shook his head sadly, as he looked at her, and thought how men, with the
                  attributes of gods, might refresh their great hearts in the inspiration of her
                  presence, and go forth strengthened for titanic effort. How worthy was she to
                  awaken a softer passion in nobler natures, enamoured with the majesty of science,
                  whose labours in rifting new and precious truths from out the darkness of ages,
                  might find, in affection like hers, reward. Men through whose love, her name might
                  become immortal. Or how, enshrined amid the ever sounding music of some poet
                  heart, her beauty, grace, and love, might glide on melodious numbers to later
                  ages, living in human memories, when that beauty and grace were mouldering, and
                  that love had become translated.</p>
               <p>But, alas! far away from companionship like this, her obscure path would lead,
                  amid the baleful solitude of an unequal union; amid human tribulations, which she
                  must meet with such strength as God gave her; sustaining, with woman's courage,
                  her woman's weakness, and the unstable heart of him who should have been her
                  counsellor, guide, and comfortor.</p>
               <p>"Oh beloved! for thy sake, not for mine, doth my soul<pb n="248-249"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000125"/> rebel! How dare I sit supinely watching this fate
                  entoil thee," he thought, "nor make one effort to break the unnatural spell?" And
                  again, "She is blinded, dazzled, by this impish boy! Be it mine to anoint her eyes

               <p>But when he looked at her serene beauty, he wondered where he should gather
                  courage to disturb her peace.</p>

               <p>RAIN! rain! rain! The next day, and the next, and next. "I think," said Cola, as
                  he looked from the window one morning, "I think it will be clear at noon."</p>
               <p>"So you have been saying for three days, Sir Hopeful!"</p>
               <p>"So I intend to say, every day, until the result shows me a prophet."</p>
               <p>It was not necessary to predict this again, as at noonday the rain ceased, the
                  lowering clouds parted and rolled heavily away like scrolls of lead.</p>
               <p>The Captain came down from the Eyrie to inquire after the delicate and consistent
                  lady, who would not permit a storm to keep her at home, but allowed it to
                  interfere with her returning. He reported that, in consequence of the protracted
                     rain<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC5981-00000126"/> and melting snows, the river
                  was rising, and there was every appearance of a flood.</p>
               <p>"Then I must mount, and ride to the creek timber-lands, if I would prevent some
                  thousands from melting like the snow," said Mr. Irving, rising with energy. "Ring,
                  Howard, for my horse to be saddled instantly. Yet stay!" He looked at his wife
                  with a dubious countenance, and throwing himself into his chair again,
                  muttered—</p>
               <p>"What matter for that? let it go."</p>
               <p>"Howard," said Mrs. Irving, "do you not see your father is unwell? Show him that
                  he has a son to relieve him of his burdens."</p>
               <p>"Let me go, father!" cried the young man. "I know as well as you do how to rescue
                  timber from the freshet."</p>
               <p>"And I'll go, too," volunteered Cola, promptly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Irving looked dubiously from his wife to the young men.</p>
               <p>"Well, go, and do your best," said he at length. "It is important business,
                  youngsters; but I think I may depend on you. Start at once—ride fast—ride all
                  night. When you approach the ground, engage all the men and teams to follow you,
                  at any price. Upon the success of your efforts depends thousands."</p>
               <p>"Never fear, father," cried Howard. "All that men can do, we will. I will go at
                  once to the stable for my horse."</p>
               <p>"And send round one for me," said Cola.</p>
               <p>The horses were soon at the door. Howard ran up the steps to summon Conway, when
                  through the side light of the hall door he saw—Oh despair! what did he see?</p>
               <p>Viola, standing on the stairway like a goddess on her pedestal, and Conway with
                  sacrilegious arm encircling her waist, and laughing face upturned to hers. She
                  stooped over him with a fond smile, while her heavy curls lay mingled with his!
                  Howard, with an enraged malediction, threw open the door.</p>
               <p>"You're ready, are you?" said Cola coolly, as Viola retreated up the stairs. "By,
                  by, Viola!"</p>
               <p>"Good-bye," she said, "and take good care of—each other."</p>
               <p>"Take good care of him for <emph>her</emph> sake!" thought Howard, as they
                  splashed through slush and mud, and he felt the spirit of Cain in his bosom.</p>
               <p>He <emph>was</emph> false and faithless then, this laughing boy whom he had loved!
                     <emph>And he had won her!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Their road lay along the river, and the facile Cola was excited, and delighted,
                  with the grandeur and novelty of the breaking up of ice. "Hark, how the waters
                  groan and labour; and how the ice bursts and booms, while the mountains send back
                  a sullen reverberation! The mighty upheaving element is rending her fetters—see!
                  You solid floor, over which these horses might have galloped three days ago, parts
                  and yawns like an earthquake. Now, huge masses are heaved in the air! now, they
                  fall over upon each other, piling like glaciers, while the waters rage and roar
                  around them. Oh, this is sublime!" and the gay fellow laughed and clapped his
                  hands.</p>
               <pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC5981-00000127"/>
               <p>"I would not like to perish in that cruel element," he resumed. "Think of the
                  sudden, choking, gasping, death! The violent rushing of the flood in eyes, ears,
                  and mouth, penetrating through every avenue of sense, forcing the soul out! Ugh!
                  its awful, and chills my blood to think of."</p>
               <p>Howard made no reply—(indeed, he had not spoken since their ride commenced) and
                  Cola rattled on. "My horror of water amounts to hydrophobia, and has prevented my
                  learning to swim. They say that drowning is an easy death, though! For my part I
                  am willing to believe I am reserved for another end."</p>
               <p>"A rope's end," growled Howard, savagely.</p>
               <p>Cola laughed. "Your familiar has power over you to-night, my bitter-sweet! It's
                  very well, for there is work for him. The lumbermen will be busy with hands and
                  horses, and we will have difficulty in securing the aid we want. Set your
                  indomitable imp to devising stratagems for the emergency, and don't let him be
                  chary. All things are honourable in love and war."</p>
               <p>"A sententious maxim, cloaking defective ethics, is fit for <emph>your</emph>
                  golden rule," said Howard.</p>
               <p>Conway looked inquiringly into his dark scowling face. "If I was not used to your
                  moods I would be afraid to ride alone with you," he said. "You look as if you
                  would like to murder me! I don't know what has disturbed you to-night, but I do
                  know, that, if I were to repeat to you, in your lucid moments, all that you say in
                  the madness of wrath, you would be shocked at yourself. It's well I am a
                  good-natured-fellow, whose affectionate forbearance"—</p>
               <p>"<emph>Peace!</emph>" shouted Howard, sternly.</p>
               <p>The babbling boy ceased his gibes, and, in silence, they rode up the darkling
                  valley.</p>

               <p>"I AM so glad I came!" said Viola, encircling her friend's waist with her arm.
                  "This is better than sitting through these stormy holidays at home, picturing your
                  dear parlour so bright and warm, and hospitable, and wishing I could pop in to
                  share your merry Christmas."</p>
               <p>"It is duller than you expected it would be, now that the boys, as mamma calls
                  them, are gone," responded Helen, with a sickly smile.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Viola, quite frankly. "What a merry quartette we make! You and Howard,
                  Cola and I; but I have been quite happy, nevertheless, and, indeed, Helen, I
                  believe I am always happy. Of course, when surrounded by those I love, I am most
                  so, but who would not be happy under such influences? But when the weather is
                  dull, and provocative of gloom, and I sit alone, engaged in some distasteful
                  occupation, sewing, for instance (you know I hate to sew), my heart seems to sing
                  in my breast. I sometimes fear this preternatural elation may be the harbinger of
                  some great sorrow. Do <emph>you</emph> ever feel the gladness I describe?"</p>
               <p>"Never," sighed poor Helen.</p>
               <p>"I don't think you do," said Viola, "for you have seemed sad of late, darling; I
                  thought that the coming of your brother and—and Cola would arouse you, but it has
                  not seemed to do so. How shall I inoculate you with my joy?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>You!</emph> you have so much to make you happy!" sobbed poor Helen,
                  throwing herself into Viola's arms.</p>
               <p>"Oh, my dear, naughty, ungrateful little Helen, don't say so! Have you forgotten
                  that you are the most tenderly beloved of father, mother, and brother, while
                     I—<emph>I am alone!</emph>—How strangely, yet justly, are the gifts of
                  Providence divided! <emph>You,</emph> favoured child! have all that the yearning
                  affections of humanity most prize, while I, denied the usual objects of love, and
                  sources of pleasure, am compensated by the endowment of a contented, thankful,
                  happy heart."</p>
               <p>"I acknowledge your superiority," said Helen, with a dash of her brother's
                  bitterness, as she disengaged herself from Viola's embrace, and wiped her eyes.
                  "You have every personal and mental gift."</p>
               <p>"Nay, Helen, I will not let you speak so to me. It is no merit of mine that I am
                  happy, for I am not so without a<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC5981-00000129"/> cause.
                  My heart is overflowing with a secret, Helen; I have found one to love me."</p>
               <p>Helen averted her face, while Viola continued—</p>
               <p>"I have feared, lately, that you did not like him, as you used to do, and the
                  thought distresses me. You will love him for my sake, will you not? and some day I
                  will tell you all about it. It is a wonderful story; but here comes Uncle Captain,
                  who hates grave looks; so clear your brow, and smile."</p>
               <p>At the timber grounds all was commotion. Men, horses, oxen, were labouring to
                  secure the newly-felled and valuable trees upon which the flood was steadily
                  advancing. Howard directed their efforts, and toiled himself with a desperate
                  energy, which doubtless received its impetus from the mental excitement under
                  which he laboured.</p>
               <p>Cola, to whom the scene was novel and exciting, aided with the zealous and ready
                  activity of youth, often pausing to survey his surroundings.</p>
               <p>The magnificent forest seemed to his lively imagination a vast fane, dedicated to
                  solitude by former ages, and now invaded by the irreverent feet and demolishing
                  hands of Mammon's votaries. Huge trunks rose upward around him, beyond him, and
                  beyond each other, in interminable colonnade, until lost in arching branches and
                  light tracery of twigs. The ground was covered by these columns, fallen and vacant
                  pedestals, indicating where for centuries they had stood.</p>
               <p>Cola's resentment, always short-lived, was lost in the interest and amazement
                  awakened by this novel scene. With restored good-humour he mingled with the
                  workmen, lending a helping hand to one, talking cheerily with another, making
                  piquant and amusing observations to a third, until their stolid natures warmed
                  toward his handsome, laughing face; their secret discontent at Howard's
                  imperiousness, melted under the influence of his frolic mood, and the forest
                  echoed with a rude, yet hearty merriment, that seemed to give an impetus to
                  labour</p>
               <p>When, at last, the work was done, and their horses' bridles were untied from the
                  trees where they had been fastened, Cola had forgotten that Howard had given him
                  offence; or only remembered to excuse it, as one of those unaccountable glamours
                  that occasionally possessed and perverted his nature.</p>
               <p>As Conway rode sometimes beside, sometimes behind him, listening to the tumult of
                  rushing waters, and the plash-plash of horses' hoofs, his genial mood chilled, and
                  he began to reflect (a thing which the poor boy did but seldom) upon the
                  circumstances of the last week. This distasteful mental exercise resulted in a
                  conviction that the festivities at Mrs. Irving's would have been more complete
                  without him. He grew sad as he thought that there was no home-welcome, no joyous
                  domestic reunion for him, at this season of world-wide rejoicing. Then, with a
                  flash of spirit, he resolved that his unacceptable presence should not intrude
                  upon the festivities of others, and began to devise an ingenious fable of certain
                  letters just received, requiring his instant presence in Kamtschatka, or
                  Burrampooter, to be narrated to his good hostess Mrs. Irving, to account for a
                  precipitate departure. Then, this innocent youth, unconscious of his grave
                  offences, wondered what foul fiend<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC5981-00000130"/>
                  possessed his irascible friend, and why the blushing little Helen had grown pale
                  as a mute at a funeral, and responded to his gallant speeches with demure,
                  discouraging phraseology, and red eyes. Her eyes had grown weak, he was sure of
                  that; for they were always red now, and he used to think them bright as Viola's
                  own. Viola, yes; <emph>she</emph> was a darling, a trump! always cheerful,
                  smiling, and pleasant. He liked your gay, jolly-hearted women, whose words might
                  be set to merrie music and sung in a glee. Thinking of glees, there was a famous
                  one out, which he should learn to sing at Taptoes' suppers. The fellows would
                  always have him sing, and his old songs were regular bores; and forgetting his
                  momentary mortification and sadness, he began, with musical zeal, to hum the new
                  air.</p>
               <p>While this medley of thought passed through Cola's mercurial brain, Howard gave
                  himself up anew to rage, and hate. The novelty, grandeur, and beauty of recent
                  scenes appealed to a preoccupied mind, and failed to win him from himself. The
                  activity and excitement of his late business had partially drawn him from
                  contemplation of his wrongs; but now, the pressure being removed, his mind, like a
                  bent sapling, sprang back to its original attitude. The presence of Cola
                  exasperated him; he thought of him as an ungrateful viper, whom he longed to shake
                  off, and crush beneath his heel; and so, they reached the river.</p>
               <p>At the junction of the stream they had been following, with the river, a mass of
                  drift-wood from the lumber grounds above had collected. Howard observed, entangled
                  with loose branches and logs, a small skiff, which he thought belonged to one of
                  his father's men; and he dismounted with the intention of rescuing it if
                  possible.</p>
               <p>Walking out from log, to log, to where the boat lay, he essayed to draw it in, but
                  it was too firmly wedged for him to move it.</p>
               <p>"That is the boat poor Hawley was lamenting," said Cola, who had followed him. "It
                  is well packed, isn't it? You'll never loosen it that way, let me show you how to
                  manage it;" and leaping into the skiff, with a long pole he began to push away
                  from the accumulated obstructions, and out into the stream.</p>
               <p>"There! it rides easy now; but the current is strong here. Hawley will be glad to
                  get his boat again. <q>

                  farther, into the current? Here is a rope fastened to the bow; catch it when I
                  throw it to you, and pull me in."</p>
               <p>The mad young man (let us hope he was mad), folded his arms and glared sullenly at
                  his victim. The rope, which Cola threw, fell on the log at his feet, and slowly
                  trailed into the turbid water, as the little skiff swept
                  downward—downward—faster—faster—and whirled into the turbulent river.</p>
               <p>Fix your cruel eyes upon your victim, Man of Wrath! Fasten on your seething brain
                  the picture that is to haunt it ever more! He has thrown his cap aside to wipe the
                  great drops from his brow, and stands with long curls floating in the wind, and
                  large eyes fixed in wondering horror.</p>
               <p>His arms are lifted toward you in supplication; and thus he drifts out upon the
                  waste of waters, and into the thickly gathering blackness of the night, leaving
                  his image, beautiful in agony as a young Laocöon, branded on your memory.</p>
               <p>"Cola! good Cola! throw me the rope once more! Oh heaven, it will not reach me
                  now! Use your pole, and push toward shore, and you will be saved! Oh, 'tis too
                  short to sound the depths of those swollen waters! God forgive me, there is no
                  hope, and I have murdered him!"</p>
               <p>Ay, call on God for forgiveness, you, who could not forgive your brother. Gibber
                  your unintelligible expressions of late repentance, and remorse without fruit,
                  trusting they may atone for hate and murder!</p>
               <p>But see! he lifts his stricken head, and shouts once more above the mocking
                  exultation of hurrying waves. "Dear Cola, I'll ride for help, and you shall yet be
                  saved! Let not your courage fail you;" and mounting his steed, he galloped down
                  the valley.</p>
               <p>The mountain river, which Cola remembered, gliding like a poem through
                  music-haunted shores, was now a vast expanse of devastating waters. He, who had
                  floated over its placid bosom beneath the moonlit skies of June, singing soft love
                  songs, to the plash of oars, and murmur of waters, was now borne down to terrible
                  destruction by the aroused and angry flood.</p>
               <p>Its breast was covered with spoil. Stacks of hay, wrecks of houses, timbers of
                  fallen bridges, and trees uprooted from their forests, by the might of wrestling
                  waters, rushed downward, endangering the frail boat in which his life was
                  ventured. Huge masses of ice came crashing and grinding, threatening to crush,
                  like an egg shell, the little craft. The waves leaped up and licked its side
                  hungrily, then sank away, roaring like wolves impatient for prey; while the horror
                  of darkness fast closed over all.</p>
               <p>The weather had again changed, and the night was bitter cold. He had not felt it
                  in the excitement of alarm; but as his blood stagnated in hopelessness, he found
                  that if the waters forbore to engulph him, he should perish with cold ere
                  morning.</p>
               <p>He could no longer distinguish the shores, yet might be near them: might be
                  drifting into some friendly eddy, where a deposit of firm ice, would offer
                  lodgement for the skiff and bridge his way to shore. But, no; far off, through the
                  frosty air, he distinguishes the lights of a village. It seems, oh Heaven! how
                  distant; yet he knows it is close upon the shore.<pb n="262-263"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000132"/> He does not know that an anxious crowd is gathered
                  there, striving, by the vain light of tossing flambeaux, to pierce thick darkness,
                  and discover the fated man: that words of cheer are shouted out through hard
                  hands, eager to lend their aid—words of kindly cheer, that die away above the
                  cruel waters ere they reach him; yet, piercing through blackness, rise up to
                  Heaven, and are placed on eternal record there! He does not know this, as
                  downward, downward, sweeps the frail boat, upheld amid an hundred perils in the
                  hollow of God's hand. But, without knowing, he watches those friendly lights
                  fading in distance, and feels nearer his kind, while he can see them shining. He
                  pictures calm household faces gathered around them, with books or needlework,
                  happily unconscious of the strange tragedy transpiring within the reach of those
                  faint taper rays. As he watches them they seem like the stars, calm and cold, and
                  at last are quenched in distance, leaving him alone with the darkness, and his
                  strange fate.</p>
               <p>Another village, and again friendly lights gleam over the waters. He is nearer the
                  shore this time, and now he knows those are no fireside tapers, but huge pine
                  torches, hurried to and fro, pressed to the edge of the dark water, and held aloft
                  until their glare throws a track of light athwart the abysmal blackness. He knows
                  that eager hands carry them—that intense excitement prevails—that human sympathies
                  are at work, and ingenious brains busy, devising schemes for his deliverance; and
                  knowing this, tears moisten his staring eyeballs, and his chilled heart is lifted
                  with thanksgiving. He shouts with the energy of hope, which is stronger than
                  despair, and the watchful, waiting throng, hear and answer. They throw their
                  torches far out into the river; like shooting stars, they flash through the air,
                  reveal dark hurrying objects on the rushing flood, and fall hissing and quenched,
                  midway between the watching crowd and the poor wretch they would aid. Then the few
                  remaining lights die away up the shore, and he is again alone, with the tears of
                  thanksgiving frozen on his face, and his limbs numb with cold.</p>
               <p>Life is dear, and with a determination to eke out its bitter dregs, he beat his
                  stiffened arms athwart his breast, that the stagnant blood might pulse more freely
                  through his veins. He does not think he will die yet! He has grown familiar with
                  the horrors of this awful night, and begins to feel quite safe amid the raging
                  waters, grinding ice, and bitter cold. He thinks there is great <emph>hope!</emph>
                  The miracle that has preserved his life thus far may be prolonged! He may be
                  driven out of the whirling current, and lodged among driftwood near the shore.
                  There is a bridge below, and he may strike the pier, and clamber up in safety.
                  There are many chances of escape; this hopeful nature believes, but the throng on
                  shore know there is but one—that is in the bridge.</p>
               <p>Although ominous whispers are heard, impeaching the stability of those stout
                  piers, the bridge is crowded. There, too, those welcome lights glimmer in a long
                  line, like lamps in a huge gallery. Ropes, hanging from its sides, sway in the
                  wind, or trail in the flood; lanterns are suspended almost to the water's edge,
                  that he may see, and grasp with sure hand<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC5981-00000133"
                  /> the thread upon which his life hangs. All that human ingenuity can do, has been
                  done, to aid him in this strange extremity.</p>
               <p>He nears them, and a great shout goes up as they perceive his boat, like a dark
                  speck, on the water.</p>
               <p>How the sound of human voices thrills him!</p>
               <p>They are so near that he can answer, thus holding brief communion with his kind.
                  Amid a tumult of directions he grasps at the nearest rope. A mass of ice turns his
                  boat aside, and missing it, he is swept on.</p>
               <p>There are ropes pendent from the other side, and he almost throws himself headlong
                  from the boat to seize them; but his stiffened fingers fail him, and the anxious
                  crowd see him emerge from beneath the bridge, and glide downward, on—on!—</p>
               <p>They throw after him cloaks, overcoats, and blankets, that he may wrap himself
                  from the cold, but say to one another that the poor fellow will not need them
                  long, for the dam is below, where his boat must capsize, and this protracted agony
                  end. Others answer, that the dam is "drowned out," and can do no harm, but that he
                  must perish with cold before he reaches the next bridge, which is twelve miles
                  away.</p>
               <p>And, praying God to have mercy on his soul, they go in groups to get something to
                  warm them, and talk the matter over by the light pine fires, while the handsome
                  boy, cut off from human aid, drifts out into silence and solitude again.</p>

               <p>HOW merrily blaze the logs in the parlour chimney to-night! How brightly burn the
                  well-trimmed lamps! The curtains, how rich and warm. The mirrors, how burnished
                  and gleaming, as they show to each other, in multiplied reflection, blaze after
                  blaze, and lamp upon lamp; inviting the beholder to believe himself in some
                  interminable hall, illuminated by endless ranges of lights and fires!</p>
               <p>The sofas seem more luxurious than we ever before thought them, and the room more
                  cosy and comfortable. Viola chatters pleasantly and prettily, and Helen responds
                  with a languid smile. Walsingham discourses calm philosophies, while Mrs.
                     Irving,<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC5981-00000134"/> from her chair beside him,
                  half-musing, half-listening, with head upon her hand, looks kindly in his face, in
                  sweet content. The Captain tells the stories of a traveller, in his jolly hearty
                  way, but does not disturb Mr. Irving, who, reposing apart in his luxurious chair,
                  seems enjoying the most composing of winter naps.</p>
               <p>For, is not this the Christmas time, when, centuries ago, the blackness of night
                  was rifted by the glistening of angels' wings, stooping to earth on heavenly
                  errands? And, in the ear of our ancient mother, slumbering heavily beneath
                  manifold burdens, they sang, "Peace on earth, good-will toward men."</p>
               <p>And so in this, and all Christian households, there is peace to-night. So, in
                  every human heart, there should be goodwill.</p>
               <p>No thought of anguish, or dread, intrudes upon this calm circle, for the
                  despairing cry, this moment, bursting from the lips of the young victim, rings, on
                  the frosty night, miles and miles away. But the shriek of the relentless wind
                  penetrates through barred shutter, and crystal casement, and crimson hanging,
                  silencing the soft murmur of conversation.</p>
               <p>A shadow crossed the mother's face, even in that brilliant room, where lights were
                  so multiplied, there seemed no hiding-place for shadows.</p>
               <p>"I wonder where the poor boys are, and how they fare?"</p>
               <p>Then those merry and fanciful girls beguiled her anxiety by describing some poor
                  woodman's cabin, now sheltering them; with unplastered walls of logs, and broken
                  ladder, by which they ascended to rude cots beneath the roof; where, rapt in
                  skins, they snugly lay, watching, through crannies, the glimmer of distant
                  stars.</p>
               <p>Walsingham told that beautiful fable of the magic mirror, whose depths revealed
                  the forms of the absent to the gaze of yearning love, and repeated the ballad of
                  "Geraldine."</p>
               <p>"Look!" exclaimed Helen, suddenly pointing to the mirror near her mother, and all
                  eyes instantly turned upon it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Irving uttered an exclamation, and buried her face with her hands.</p>
               <p>All was instant confusion! Helen's languor was lost in wild excitement; Viola's
                  joyousness gave place to dread. Mrs. Irving's serene content was succeeded by
                  great distress, and Walsingham's calmness was lost in surprise. The Captain,
                  forgetting his hearty jollity, indulged in terse expressions of impatience, while
                  Mr. Irving, disturbed in his repose, arose and turned toward the company,
                  revealing a livid and distorted face.</p>
               <p>All gathered around the magic mirror, and stared in its depths for the solution of
                  the mysterious disturbance; but they saw only their own frightened faces repeated
                  at intervals between the interminable lights, and so multiplied by reflection, and
                  counter-reflection, as to look like a horrified mob by torchlight.</p>
               <p>"Oh, mother! what did you see?" sobbed Helen. "I only pointed to the glass that
                  you might see how the fire shone in it."</p>
               <p>"You are nervous and foolish, child!" said Mrs. Irving,<pb n="268-269"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000135"/> sternly. I saw nothing but what you all must have
                  seen—that my husband is very ill."</p>
               <p>"Papa! Where has he gone? Why he was asleep!"</p>
               <p>"He was not asleep. Walsingham, satisfy these children that there is nothing to
                  alarm them, while I look after my husband. Go to bed, girls, as soon as you feel
                  composed. Goodnight."</p>
               <p>And those cold mirrors, glistening with fires that never warmed them, and throwing
                  reflections back and forth like shuttlecocks, had not revealed in their mystic
                  depths the remorseful horseman, galloping madly down the frozen valley—the
                  despairing voyager, afloat upon the watery waste!</p>
               <p>But, if their shining surfaces had darkened to the blackness of night without, and
                  the events transpiring, miles away, had moved in awful procession athwart the
                  gloom, their revelations could not have been more fearful or startling, than that
                  which burst upon Mrs. Irving, when she turned her head in obedience to her
                  daughter's exclamation.</p>
               <p>She was seated near Walsingham, whom it always fell to her lot to entertain. His
                  conversation this evening harmonized with her own thoughts, and gave her a quiet
                  pleasure. The fable of the mirror had been a favourite with her years ago, and she
                  lifted her eyes, sparkling with pleasure, to Walsingham, as he narrated a story
                  which revived romantic fancies of her own youth.</p>
               <p>At this moment Helen exclaimed, and, looking around, her attention was arrested by
                  her husband. With his back toward her, he still reclined in the arm-chair, where
                  she had supposed him sleeping. But in the mirror she caught the reflection of his
                  face, and saw that his eyes were fixed searchingly upon her own, with an
                  expression of utter anguish that appalled her.</p>
               <p>One moment of tender scrutiny, and the expression of that beloved face was
                  analyzed.</p>
               <p>She knew now what had, for months, weighed on her husband's mind, and, with the
                  shock of the discovered secret, her heart quaked!</p>

               <p>MRS. IRVING sat in her chamber awaiting her husband, and recalling a thousand
                  trifles corroborative of her sudden conviction that he was <emph>jealous!</emph>
                  Jealous of Walsingham. The idea was both horrible and absurd. Amused and
                  distressed, she laughed and wept alternately, and felt half-disposed to succumb to
                  these conflicting emotions in hysterics. Like a sensible woman as she was, she
                  soon subdued her excitement, and proceeded calmly to examine the circumstances
                  which had placed her in this unpleasant position, and devise the readiest means of
                  dissipating the illusion that obscured her husband's judgment.</p>
               <p>She knew his strong nature, and deep affection for her, coupled with a certain
                  distrust of his own powers of pleasing, predisposed him to this fault. She
                  remembered, he often listened to her praises of Walsingham with uneasy impatience,
                  while she playfully exaggerated her admiration of that gentleman, for the purpose
                  of teasing her lord, little thinking that the seed thus carelessly sown would bear
                  such poison fruit. She remembered, too, that he had avoided Walsingham of late,
                  often with positive rudeness, while she had been more in his society than was
                  customary, considering their respective positions of matron and bachelor.</p>
               <p>In this, however, she felt that she had been innocent. Walsingham, as a gentleman
                  of leisure, found but little companionship among men around him. Those of his own
                  age were too much engrossed by the active pursuits of life, to seek or care for
                  social intercourse; while those who were younger, such as Howard and Cola, were
                  too full of the buoyant extravagances of youth to afford congenial companionship
                  to one of his matured experiences. The society of ordinary women he found vapid
                  and childish, while that of Mrs. Irving he relished. She was a cultivated and
                  sensible woman of his own age; his equal in life's experiences; of matured
                  judgment, lively sympathies, and womanly heart. The motherly interest she had
                  always taken in Viola was a bond of sympathy between them, and it was his custom
                  to discuss with her everything pertaining to that young lady's welfare, and in
                  matters of doubt or difficulty be guided by her judicious counsels.</p>
               <p>When he brought his ward to visit her friends, it was the custom of the young
                  people to wander off together, leaving<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC5981-00000137"/>
                  Mrs. Irving to entertain the elder guest. During these frequent tête-à-têtes they
                  never were at a loss for pleasing themes; and often, when they sat apart, her
                  sweet face glowing with eager interest, or flashing in the excitement of animated
                  conversation, the gloomy husband would scowl grimly at the door and disappear.</p>
               <p>Of all this she had suddenly become conscious. "How stupid," she cried, "not to
                  have seen it sooner! and yet how could I conceive myself the object of suspicions
                  so preposterous?" Thinking of these things, she waited for his footstep at her
                  door, but he did not come. She flew down stairs and sought him through the house.
                  She found him in the library, his head resting on his hand, and his whole attitude
                  bespeaking deep dejection.</p>
               <p>"George Irving, George Irving! how you have wronged your little wife!" was her
                  salutation, half reproachful, half tender, as she threw herself upon his
                  bosom.</p>
               <p>"I never wronged you," he answered heavily, submitting to her caresses.</p>
               <p>"Then my beloved, honoured husband wrongs himself."</p>
               <p>"Don't, Mary! I cannot bear it," he cried. Starting up, and putting her from him,
                  he paced the floor in strong excitement. Suddenly he paused, and regarded her with
                  a look of profound compassion.</p>
               <p>"My poor child, I pity, more than blame you; for if you love this man, this devil,
                  your sufferings must be your punishment."</p>
               <p>The accused wife made no reply, for she felt that it was not yet time. Her jealous
                  husband must relieve himself of all that had been festering in his heart, before
                  she attempted her vindication.</p>
               <p>"I have seen it," he resumed, "from the moment of his return. At your first
                  interview, you were fascinated by him, and lavished such encomiums upon him as I
                  had never heard applied by your lips to mortal man before. I feared then, all that
                  has befallen since; I have observed your growing intimacy in silence; have seen
                  you blush and smile, and be happy in his presence, until I hoped my jealous heart
                  would burst; and yet I have forborne!"</p>
               <p>"George, George, you frighten me!"</p>
               <p>"I would not frighten you. As I live, I cannot entertain an emotion of wrath
                  against you. Grief—profound, unutterable grief, is all that I can feel. I am too
                  unmanned for anger. Oh God! Am I thus wrecked! Did all the long, bright, happy
                  years which you have blessed to me, lead but to this?" and he covered his face
                  with his hands.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have wronged you, as you say," he resumed. "In your untried girlhood,
                  before your heart knew itself, I married you; <emph>you,</emph> whom I knew to be
                  too good, too beautiful, to mate with such a clod as I. I thought, fool that I
                  was! that love such as mine, would compensate for all else; would insure love in
                  return.</p>
               <p>"You have increased in experience and knowledge, since then, and now, as a
                  refined, accomplished woman, have learned the error of your early choice; while
                     <emph>I</emph>—I have lost the little grace of youth; have centred my best
                  energies in the dull details<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC5981-00000138"/> of a
                  business, which was all important in my eyes, because upon its success depended
                  the happiness of yourself and little ones; have retrograded intellectually, until
                  I am unfit to mate with you!" and he turned aside, to hide the tears which strong
                  emotion forced from his eyes.</p>
               <p>"Nay, do not speak to me! Do I not know that the conversation of this intellectual
                  and gifted man affords you the mental aliment which my society can never give? Do
                  I not acknowledge in my heart, when I see you together, that you are fitly mated?
                  and do I not feel that if a bolt from heaven would blot me from existence, it
                  would be in mercy to us all?"</p>
               <p>"George, my husband! you who have known me for a lifetime, what have you ever seen
                  in me that can justify suspicions such as these? How can you, who are ever just to
                  others, so misjudge me? Sinning against my love, and outraging my truth by
                  accusations of—of—what shall I say? to what do these suspicions tend?
                  Dishonour?"</p>
               <p>"Dishonour! No, thank God! I know your rectitude too well for that. But there is a
                  voice that charms your ear—a presence that refreshes your heart, and—they are not
                  your husband's, Mary."</p>
               <p>"My husband—"</p>
               <p>"Your plain, dull husband, is forgotten in this dazzling presence, or remembered
                  with vague regret. You are scarcely conscious of this yourself, because you have
                  not watched your thoughts or analyzed your feelings, as I have done. Unwittingly
                  it is, that your heart wavers in its allegiance.</p>
               <p>"But why should I, who am but a satyr to this Hyperion, expect to retain that
                  which I feel myself unworthy to inspire. Heaven knows, I can claim nought upon my
                  own merits, while hoping everything from long-established rights, and early
                  vows."</p>
               <p>He seemed so humble in his love for her, yet so proud in his humility, that she
                  was deeply touched. With unhesitating tenderness, she drew his hands from his
                  face, and looked into his troubled eyes with such a clear and truthful gaze, that
                  scales seemed to fall from before them.</p>
               <p>"Look at me, George, and learn to read me better!" she said, simply.</p>
               <p>He looked as she bade him, and in the tender depths of her upturned eyes, saw his
                  own image. The mists that had encompassed his judgment vanished before the
                  sunshine of her glance; and looking still farther down through those windows of
                  the soul, he saw his own image enshrined in her heart of hearts. He felt that she
                  was his truthful, loving wife, while he was but a jealous fool.</p>
               <p>"Confess that you have never known how well your wife loved you," she said, with a
                  smile, as she saw conviction brightening on his face.</p>
               <p>"Mary, you are an angel, and I a poor, unworthy, jealous—"</p>
               <p>"Hush!" she said, with an effort at playfulness, which soon declined into
                  earnestness as she proceeded: "Hush, I have listened to you too long, and now it
                  is my turn to speak. I must make my manifesto now, that you and I may be spared a
                  recurrence of the pain we have suffered, and then—this subject will be dropped for
                  ever, as unworthy of us both."</p>
               <pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC5981-00000139"/>
               <p>The wife paused, as though to gather courage, and when she resumed, her voice
                  faltered with emotion.</p>
               <p>"I would say to my husband that neither the remembrance of his 'rights' or my
                  obligations, could awaken the ardent, constant, and bounteous affection with which
                  I have enriched his daily life. My love has been the spontaneous tribute of a
                  heart impressed by the nobility of his nature.</p>
               <p>"I married, as you say, in early girlhood, giving you the first freshness of a
                  virgin heart. I have been the wife of a lifetime, the mother of your children;
                  have been encircled by your tried affection through years of happiness, sustained
                  by it in sorrow and trial, until my love—the love of an old wife, George—has so
                  fed on gratitude, and grown with time, that it exceeds in fondness and fervour the
                  freshness of its flushing, as my ripened womanhood transcends my youth.</p>
               <p>"Nay, hear me to the end! I have associated much with this man, perhaps. Your own
                  unclouded judgement will furnish you with reasons. He is, as you say, an
                  intellectual man, and as such, his society has afforded me pleasure. But my
                  husband's wisdom, his justice, his generosity, his integrity—in short, all the
                  manly virtues I admire and value in him, are not forgotten, when I chance to enjoy
                  the conversation of another. My heart is not thus wanton. You spoke of mental
                  aliment! A woman requires aliment for her <emph>heart,</emph> and here I feed
                  mine," and she threw herself upon his broad breast weeping.</p>
               <p>"Forgive me," he whispered, as he clasped her closely in the energy of remorseful
                  love. "Forgive me, for I have been mad."</p>
               <p>"Your affection blinds you, George, indeed it does," she said, raising her tearful
                  eyes. "I am no longer young and beautiful, as you deem me. Our children are almost
                  man and woman, now, and I am but an old and faded wife—one whose heart reposes
                  calmly, as befits her years, upon the anchor in which it trusted through the
                  storms of passionate youth."</p>
               <p>"Ever young, ever beautiful to me!" he whispered.</p>
               <p>"So I would be, to <emph>you,</emph>" she answered, with an arch smile shining
                  through her tears; "but beware how you believe me attractive to others. You see me
                  with the eyes of love and memory—others behold me as I am. And now, love, it is
                  late! All the world is asleep, save you and me, who have been talking like sad
                  fools, and who—"</p>
               <p>"Well, speak on!"</p>
               <p>"Who are old enough to know better."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXVI.</head>
               <head type="sub">REMORSE.</head>
               <p>WHEN the unhappy Howard turned from the supplicating figure of his friend, it was
                  with the purpose of saving himself, if possible, from the actual guilt of murder.
                  The life of this poor waif upon the stream, was to him priceless, now. He would
                  have bought it with his own. The faults of the poor boy were unremembered. The
                  wrongs, upon which he had so fatally brooded, failed to comfort his remorse. How
                  petty and pitiful had grown those aggravations, which a few hours since festered
                  his heart with a sense of wrong, and poisoned the kindly current of his thought.
                  They had changed their aspect, and no longer seemed wrongs clamorous for
                  vengeance, but baleful phantasies that had assumed a certain shape to lure him to
                  destruction; and, having worked their evil, threw off disguise, and, with mocking,
                  pursued his ruin. How horror and remorse goaded him through the night! How, ever
                  from the angry flood, a familiar face, with its bright beauty marred by agony,
                  appealed to him! How, through thick darkness, he could see those supplicating arms
                  reach vainly after him, as he galloped down the valley! Night could not cover
                  them! Time would not destroy them! and he felt that, if years of life should
                  lengthen out before him, they would walk with him to the end. Oh, the persistent
                  tyranny of thought, that breeds such faithful phantoms!</p>
               <p>"Tramp! tramp! along the shore he rode," startling quiet sleepers with the ring of
                  hasty hoofs—rousing men from their warm beds, with his fearful story—gathering
                  crowds upon the water's edge by powerfully eloquent appeals—shouting words of
                  encouragement across the flood, in the hope that the poor voyager might hear, and
                  know that he was labouring for his rescue—might accord forgiveness, if they should
                  meet no more—might tell of his late repentance, if that night he should bear
                  record in heaven!</p>
               <p>With a sharpened sense he had heard the faint halloo, announcing that the sufferer
                  still lived, amid those swamping ice drifts! Had first discerned, by the light of
                  suspended lanterns, the boat drifting toward the bridge! Had guided his rope
                  nearest the outstretched hands! (Oh God! they were still outstretched!) Had seen,
                  by the flickering light, the pale upturned face, with the old look of agony; and
                  the billows of darkness swept over all!</p>
               <p>With the failure of this hope he fainted, and was borne from the bridge by
                  pitying, honest folks, whose hearts were touched by what they thought the faithful
                  love of brotherhood.</p>
               <p>When restored to consciousness, he mounted a fresh horse,<pb n="280-281"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000141"/> and galloped on to the next bridge, which was
                  twelve miles below. It was the bridge of the Bluff. He and Cola, with Helen and
                  Viola, had often loitered through its light arches, and leaned over its
                  balustrade, watching the heavens mirrored in the placid depths below. His errand
                  there was no summer night's saunter now! The life, or death, of the gayest of
                  their gay party hung in the balance.</p>
               <p>His old love for the youth revived, as remembrances of their early friendship
                  crowded on him. Cola's affection, generosity, and gentleness; his patience with
                  his own evil moods, passed before him. His weaknesses, too, now sacred as are the
                  faults of a dead friend. His merry quips, and gibes, and mockeries, how they rose
                  up amid the horrors of the night! And his love for Viola! How natural and
                  pardonable it seemed, that in the bewilderment of passion the thoughtless youth
                  should lose the strict path of duty.</p>
               <p>Could <emph>he</emph> blame this lapse from honour, who, under the same fatal
                  influence, had stained his soul with crime? For was he not a murderer? From the
                  time that frenzy of hate possessed him, to the last act that launched the victim
                  on his fearful voyage, the guilt of murder had been in his heart. And yet,
                  forsooth, he had been shocked, outraged, and virtuously indignant with the
                  thoughtless weakness of another! God pity him in his blindness! God pardon them
                  both, and all who grope so helplessly 'twixt wrong and right, with glimpses of the
                  pitfalls in a neighbour's path, while unconscious of the precipice beside their
                  own.</p>
               <p>The early grayness of morning threw a sullen twilight over the village as he
                  entered it. Inspired with new hope by the coming light, and prospect of friendly
                  co-operation, he knocked at his father's door. To his surprise the window of his
                  own room was thrown up, and a gruff voice hailed him.</p>
               <p>"Captain Walsingham, are <emph>you</emph> there?" he exclaimed.</p>
               <p>"Yes, my lad, and are you there? What news from the timber lands?"</p>
               <p>"I hope—I hope Viola has gone home!"</p>
               <p>"No, and is not likely to go. Don't you know the bridge is gone?"</p>
               <p>With a heavy groan the poor fellow sank upon the piazza, and the alarmed Captain
                  hastened down to open the door.</p>
               <p>"Call my father! Call Walsingham! Alarm the town, but do not waken the ladies.
                  Time enough for them to know by-and-by! Cola is adrift upon the river. He has been
                  there all night!"</p>
               <p>"All night! Then, young man, Cola is in heaven by this time!" said the Captain,
                  solemnly.</p>
               <p>"No, no! Any other man would have perished, but not he. Gather them all, and away
                  to the river!"</p>
               <p>Among the first upon the shore came Walsingham, filled with horror, by the
                  probable fate of Conway. He had wished the tie between this man, and Viola, might
                  be broken. Lo! the finger of fate was raised to part them, and his generous nature
                  would, if possible, reverse the decree. If, through the conviction of her reason,
                  or the instability of affection, Viola could relinquish him, he would rejoice. But
                  not by the sacrifice of a bright young life, mantling with promise, or by the<pb
                     n="282-283" xml:id="VAC5981-00000142"/> violent wrenching of her constant
                  heart, could he desire them to be parted.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>She loved him.</emph> This knowledge, which had bred hate and murder in
                  Howard's mind, made the young man's life seem doubly precious to the nobler
                  Walsingham. It was not merely a human life at stake, but the life in which the
                  happiness of his beloved was bound, and because of this, it was in the esteem of
                  the self-abnegating man, of more value than his own.</p>
               <p>Meantime the crowd increased, and great excitement prevailed. The people had all
                  known and loved the merry, handsome fellow, now drifting downward to death, and
                  they waited and watched, in the cold, gray dawning, to see him once more—to shout,
                  and beckon, and wave farewells, and waste their impotent sympathies upon him.
                  Howard frantically besought them to aid him in some mad plan of rescue.</p>
               <p>"My poor boy," said his father, "do you not see that it is hopeless? A score, amid
                  those ice-drifts, would be as helpless as one! Your friend is in a maelstrom,
                  where all who venture to approach with aid, must share his fate."</p>
               <p>"There is the only shadow of a hope left," said Walsingham, pointing to the wreck
                  of the bridge.</p>
               <p>On the side nearest the Bluff, where the current was strongest, the structure had
                  been swept away like a cobweb; but from the town two or three piers still arched
                  the turbid water.</p>
               <p>"Not even the shadow of a hope, there," said Mr. Irving, as he looked at the
                  splintered timbers of the ruin projecting above the gulf. "The boldest man here
                  will not venture his life upon those tottering piers."</p>
               <p>"Get me ropes," said Walsingham, "I will do all that man may do, to save this
                  youth!"</p>
               <p>"God bless you!" cried Howard, grasping his hand; "I will go with you."</p>
               <p>"This is madness," remonstrated Mr. Irving. "The remnant of the bridge will be
                  swept away within an hour, and you be lost in the ruin. Besides, can you not see
                  it does not reach the current in which he must be drifting?"</p>
               <p>"I see," said Walsingham, like one who had weighed the chances, "I see the odds
                  are against me, but there is a slender possibility of rescue, which I will not
                  lose. I am alone in the world, and can afford to make this venture; but you,
                  Howard, for the sake of mother and sister, must stay on shore."</p>
               <p>"Just so, by Jove! We are alone, and the stake is ours! Stand back, young man!"
                  and Captain Walsingham, with a coil of rope on his right arm, passed his left
                  through his brother's, and arm in arm the two walked out upon the groaning
                  piers.</p>
               <p>"Huzza! huzza! rescue! rescue!" shouted the admiring crowd; but no one followed
                  the devoted pair.</p>
               <p>"God only knows how terrible is my stake in this issue," said Howard, struggling
                  to free himself from his father's restraining hand. "If he perishes, his blood is
                  on my head. Would you have your son live a murderer? <emph>Let me go!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Listen to reason!" answered the father, to his miserable son. "I will go in your
                  stead. I offer the abilities of a strong,<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC5981-00000143"
                  /> cool man, in the place of an exhausted and excited one. Do you stay here for
                     <emph>their</emph> sakes, and I will go."</p>
               <p>"Reason? There is awful reason, father, in what I do. If Cola is lost—if you and
                  Walsingham and the Captain should perish amid those falling timbers, and I, the
                  monstrous cause of these calamities, should bear, day after day, the loathsome
                  burden of my guilty life, beneath the reproachful eyes of yon poor women, the
                  stones would cry out against me. The very sunlight, that falls in benediction upon
                  better men, would pierce me with arrows of cursing. I should go mad! No—no! death
                  is better! Let me go!"</p>
               <p>He seemed mad already. His eyes were wild, his face haggard, and his voice hoarse,
                  as though spent with raving: he struggled feebly like a weary, wilful child. His
                  father could have held him with ease, but felt there was danger in thwarting his
                  will.</p>
               <p>"Be it so, poor, foolish boy," he said. "I am the most efficient man of the two.
                  Those who venture out upon that ruin may never return; and thou and I cannot both
                  be spared. Go, and God keep you!"</p>
               <p>The Walsinghams having gained the extremity of the bridge, were busy examining
                  their position and making arrangements for the rescue, when Walsingham felt a
                  light touch on his arm. Turning, he beheld Viola. Her beautiful eyes were wildly
                  open, and her lips parted with terror and surprise. In a low, frightened whisper,
                  she asked—</p>
               <p>"<emph>Is it true?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my poor little one, it is true—but do not despair. We will save him, if
                  human aid can avail in this extremity—but this is not a fit place for you."</p>
               <p>"Let me stay with you," said she, holding both hands in hers, and looking in his
                  face pleadingly.</p>
               <p>"You cannot aid us or him, and there is danger here. Do not remain, Viola."</p>
               <p>"If you should be lost, and <emph>he</emph>—what have I to live for? Let me stay
                  with you."</p>
               <p>"Poor child, do you then love him so? Trust me, rely upon me—if God permits, I
                  will save him, even at the sacrifice of my own life; and now, as a token of your
                  confidence, I ask you to leave us."</p>
               <p>She walked a few steps, and, turning, paused irresolute.</p>
               <p>"My little girl never before disobeyed me."</p>
               <p>"You never asked me to leave you before," she answered, touchingly. "What is there
                  upon yonder shore for me, when you are here? You, whom I love better than all the
                  world—than life!" and winding her arms about him, she laid her head upon his
                  breast, and closed her eyes as if to shut out sorrow.</p>
               <p>And sorrow was shut out, for she had fainted; and so he bore her to her friends on
                  shore.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, the Captain, with his telescope, swept the river from time to time,
                  examining logs, trees, stumps, wrecks of every description. It was covered with
                  these trophies, and the old sailor observed that very few floated near them. They
                  were carried by the current toward the opposite shore.</p>
               <pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC5981-00000144"/>
               <p>"Could he have passed, in the night?" inquired Walsingham, after some time had
                  been spent in watching.</p>
               <p>Howard, who sat at his feet with face buried in his cloak, answered, "No! I have
                  ridden all night in advance of him."</p>
               <p>"Is he still afloat, think you?"</p>
               <p>"I saw him last at the bridge above. They gave me a fresh horse there, and I must
                  have ridden fast. He will soon be here! Yes, he will soon come!" and, repeating
                  this promise to himself, the young man covered his face with his cloak again.</p>
               <p>"Yes, he will soon come!" said the Captain, handing the glass to his brother.
                  "Look up the river, beyond the large tree, at that small object—there! It is a
                  boat with a man in it! There is but one human being afloat upon these waters,
                  thank God! Rouse yourself, and take heart, my man, he is coming!" and the Captain
                  began to arrange his ropes, and, breaking off the balustrade, tie a rail to the
                  end of each.</p>
               <p>"You see," said the good fellow, "it is not in reason to suppose he will steer at
                  once for the pier and be fished up. Not a stick or log has done that since we've
                  been watching. But he may come within a stone's throw, and I will heave this
                  billet of wood up the stream, as we would throw a harpoon. Please Heaven, he'll
                  catch the rope and be towed in."</p>
               <p>Upon this frail, uncertain chance, did that life depend! but God saw! God heard!
                  Pure, pious hearts, were importuning him; and so, gently, within the hollow of His
                  hand, as I have told you, He guided the skiff toward those friendly
                  watchers—turning aside the masses of ice that crushed and ground against each
                  other—warding off threatening timbers, and interposing the invisible shield of
                  Almighty protection, between that life, and multitudinous peril. No man, not even
                  he in whose behalf this miracle was wrought, can tell how, or why, he was vomited
                  from out the jaws of death that night; for none may share the councils of the
                  Almighty. But wind, and frost, and flood, were given charge concerning him, and so
                  he floated safely through the night, as Viola in her warm curtained slumber.</p>
               <p>On—on he came—his back toward the people, and his face toward the Bluff. Perhaps
                  he thought Viola was there, asleep, and unconscious of his danger! Perhaps he
                  thought of the happy hours spent beneath the roof of yon lone dwelling, and looked
                  on it as something he ne'er might see again! Perhaps he sat there frozen—stark and
                  stiff!</p>
               <p>Suddenly an obstruction struck the boat, whirling it sharply round, (mark! giving
                  it an impetus toward the friendly shore), and his face was turned to the crowd. He
                  moved as though he would fain stand up, but could not; then leaned forward, and
                  raised a pole with his handkerchief tied to it; and a great shout went up from the
                  shore.</p>
               <p>Howard had dropped his cloak and risen to his feet. In terrible excitement he
                  watched the boat drifting towards them—yes, <emph>towards</emph> them—crowded out
                  of the current, as it were, by the larger masses that choked the river. It seemed
                  nearer, to the bewildered and unsteady vision of this young man, than in reality
                  it was; and, with some insane reproaches to the Walsingham brothers, for their
                  supineness at the golden<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC5981-00000145"/> moment, he
                  seized one of the Captain's ropes, and threw it toward the skiff. Poor Howard!
                  weak in nerves, as in judgment! The missile fell far short of its destination.</p>
               <p>"Young man, I'll thank you not to meddle with my tackle," said the Captain. "Amuse
                  yourself by hauling in that line."</p>
               <p>And now, the old seaman, with steady aim and true, hurled his billet. It whizzed
                  sharply, cutting the air, and fell beyond the boat. Instantly, he gave out line
                  until it dropped across the skiff. How quickly the stiffened fingers of the
                  voyager closed upon it! How deftly he wound it around the bow; and, still floating
                  downward, he was drawn toward the pier. A moment more, and he would be swept past;
                  but he sat motionless, apparently helpless.</p>
               <p>"Quick!" shouted the Captain. "Unloose the rope, and hold on!"</p>
               <p>He did not move.</p>
               <p>"Rouse yourself, and make one last effort for life," exhorted Walsingham.</p>
               <p>He rose feebly, and fumbling at the rope, unloosed it. A moment, more, and the
                  little boat was gliding on to the sea, as before, while its inmate, grasping the
                  rope, hung over the flood. A few of the boldest men upon the shore had joined the
                  Walsinghams, and with their united strength, rapidly drew up the rope. Not rapidly
                  enough; for one hand, suddenly relaxing its grasp, fell by the sufferer's side;
                  and his whole weight hung upon one stiff, numb, almost lifeless arm.</p>
               <p>"Hold on! Hold on!" cry they all. "If you relax a muscle, you are lost!" "Keep a
                  stout heart for one more moment, and you are saved. Pull away, men."</p>
               <p>He was almost up, when Walsingham, throwing himself upon the planks, leaned over
                  and grasped, yes, grasped the arm of the almost rescued man.</p>
               <p>Just in time, Noble Heart, for his strength is spent, and he hangs helpless in
                  your stout arms. Over the bridge's splintered edge they lift, like a dead body,
                  the exhausted man! He does not greet, or thank, or question them in his old,
                  frank, ready way. He cannot answer their questionings, and congratulations; and so
                  they give him stimulants, and wrapping him in blankets, bear him to the nearest
                  house, where they chafe his frozen limbs, and apply the remedies usual for those
                  who have well nigh perished with exposure.<ref rend="super" target="#note_001"

               </note>
               <p>Viola is there, and Helen, and Mrs. Irving, for the care that would have kept this
                  fearful peril from them, has been vain; and they, with the ready tact of women,
                  minister to the necessities of the suffering youth. The doctor tells them that he
                  may yet die, and writes prescriptions that no one can read, and issues orders no
                  one can understand; while Viola almost swoons with dread, lest the grim terror
                  that pursued him through the night should insidiously steal him from the midst of
                  friends elate with rescue. Then she folds her arms about him protectingly, and
                  mourns over him in broken sentences:—</p>
               <p>"Oh, Cola! My Cola! Must I lose you? Can we now<pb n="290-291"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000146"/> be parted?" And he makes an effort to whisper that
                  he will not die, for he feels the principle of life too strong within.</p>
               <p>Then she sees Walsingham looking on them sadly, for that gentleman, although
                  thankful that God has spared these fond ones to each other, is not philosopher
                  enough to behold without a pang the caresses of his beloved, lavished upon
                  another. She sees her guardian's disquiet, I say, and seizing his hands, kisses
                  them reverently; and in her transport of gratitude, uses such language of praise
                  as causes his face to flush, while she thanks him for saving—<emph>her
                     brother!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Yes, <emph>her brother!</emph> He had heard aright, for she repeats it; and Howard
                  heard, and Helen; and a great light seems to shine in the midst! The one, half
                  stupid from the horrors through which he has lately passed, feels a thrill of
                  thankfulness that he has been spared from being the murderer of <emph>her</emph>
                  brother; the other, with a maiden's blush, feels shame that she should have been
                  jealous of the <emph>love of a brother.</emph>

               <p>POOR Helen! poor, happy Helen! To her young, tried heart, that struggled so
                  bravely with its fancied sorrow, are our sympathies first due. Walsingham, with
                  his unsuspected passion buried in the recesses of his strong heart, is sufficient
                  unto himself; and Howard, in the profound slumber, that follows exhaustion, is
                  insensible to all external things, even the subtle influence of sympathy.</p>
               <p>Poor, happy Helen, then! Happy, in the conviction that her beloved was faithful,
                  yet must we pity the self-reproach<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC5981-00000147"/>
                  which punished that loving nature because of its imperfect trust.</p>
               <p>He was once more the hero of her worship, the embodiment of all the noble
                  attributes which make man godlike! Handsome, gifted, loving—and <emph>true.</emph>
                  True to all those nameless, delicious wordings that she had treasured in her
                  maiden memory, repeated to herself in revery, and recalled in dreams, before
                  suspicion robbed them of their spirit. Then the treasures of memory became its
                  brands: burning, how deep and sore, the young sufferer knew only.</p>
               <p>And now, like a sudden phantasmagoria, the evil changed again to good. The cruel,
                  dark deceits that, spectre-like, haunted memory, smiled into light, and became
                  reanimated with the vitality of truth. Thus had he looked, thus spoken; not in
                  deception and beguiling, but in the earnestness of love, and with the holy power
                  of truth, which she, in her distrust, had resisted, and by her distrust had been
                  punished.</p>
               <p>"Oh, mamma!" she whispered, clasping the hand of that safe confidant, "I am too,
                  too happy!"</p>
               <p>"Poor child! dear daughter!" responded the mother, with tender pity.</p>
               <p>"Do not pity me, mamma, for all that I have suffered. It may be in some small
                  degree an expiation for the wrong I have done him. And now, that it is past, I
                  feel it to have been a valuable experience. I was incapable of bliss like this
                  before I suffered."</p>
               <p>The mother looked sorrowfully at her child. Helen kissed her and smiled
                  "Incredulous mamma! you do not yet believe that all has terminated happily."</p>
               <p>"My child, Heaven grant that all may terminate happily, as you say."</p>
               <p>The tone of doubt, in which this was uttered, filled Helen with dismay.</p>
               <p>"What do you mean?" she asked quickly. "Have not mine own eyes beheld him safe?
                  Did I not see, while Viola's kisses rained on him, how his eyes wandered,
                  searching me? For, even in that awful hour, I did not approach, believing he was
                  not mine: and when, under the influence of that look, I arose and came to him, he
                  drew my head upon his bosom, whispered '<emph>Beloved,</emph>' and fainted with
                  excess of bliss, as I could do, when I remember it. Oh, mother!"</p>
               <p>"Helen, this is wild. Be calm, and nerve yourself for further trial. My child,
                  could you part with this precious life, should God require it?"</p>
               <p>Helen laughed. "For what purpose would God have preserved him from the thousand
                  deaths that through the night encompassed him, if he is to die now downily? Your
                  fears are childish, mother."</p>
               <p>The mother folded her arms about her child, looked into her eyes, and said
                  impressively: "Helen, I speak truly; he is in mortal peril. The physicians think
                  he may not survive the approaching night."</p>
               <p>Helen threw off those circling arms, as though there was suffocation in the
                  embrace. "Oh, mother! cruel mother, to tell me this! Have all his brave struggles
                  with multiform,<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC5981-00000148"/> death been vain? Must I
                  resign him in the moment that he is restored to me? I cannot weep, because I
                  cannot believe it! Take me to him, that I may look in his eyes and read our fate.
                  Stay, mother; you are familiar with sickness. You have watched the pulses ebb, the
                  energies fail, and life go out. Do <emph>you</emph> think he will die?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Irving kissed her dry eyes, chafed her hot hands, yet answered with the
                  sternness of truth, "Pray for strength for the worst, my poor child, for he will
                  die."</p>
               <p>Helen bowed her head upon her clasped hands, and sank, perhaps, beneath the weight
                  of this blow—perhaps in prayer.</p>
               <p>Two large tears trickled down the mother's cheek as she watched her stricken
                  child.</p>
               <p>Helen arose, after a space, and said, "Is it not strange, mother, that I cannot
                  weep? that I cannot even feel sad? What is the meaning of this peace within, when
                  he I love is trembling upon the eternal verge? Is it that he has been restored to
                  me, and will henceforth be mine, though all space divide us? It was a beneficent
                  goodness that created us for each other, and should that same Power part us for a
                  season? Why, time is so very short, me thinks I can live, loving, hoping, and
                  happy, until bidden to join him in that sphere where love, purified from the fever
                  of passion, and imperfection of earth, will be the pervading atmosphere, and life
                  and bliss are eternal. Take me to him, mother."</p>
               <p>Walsingham was watching, with Viola, by her brother's bedside, when Helen entered.
                  He rose and resigned to her his seat at the sufferer's head. This acknowledgment
                  of her near, dear right was pleasing to her. She bent over him with a long gaze of
                  earnest inquiry.</p>
               <p>Love itself could scarcely recognise, in the poor victim before her, the handsome
                  youth who had gone forth so joyously. His clustering hair, thrown back, writhed
                  over the pillow, leaving his shrunken forehead bare; his face was scarlet, his
                  lips cracked and parched, his eyes wild and bloodshot. She touched his swollen
                  hands, and he shrunk from her with a cry of pain; then answering her gaze with a
                  look of perplexed inquiry, exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"<emph>Unstable as water!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Viola! Walsingham! Mother! what does he mean?"</p>
               <p>"He has no meaning, Helen; he is delirious," answered Walsingham.</p>
               <p>"I know the waters, and they are treacherous," he muttered, hoarsely. "They are
                  cruel to those who trust them! They spread themselves as a floor for the unwary!
                  They entangle their cold arms about him! They close their slimy jaws upon
                  him!—drag him down—down—down for ever, through a sea of agony, to fires they
                  cannot quench!"</p>
               <p>The gasping utterance of short quick sentences ceased, and, for a moment, he lay
                  panting. Then, looking at Helen, he again exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"Unstable as water! Who said it of me? 'Twas you, with your cold averted eyes! You
                  thought me like the cruel element! Did I woo treacherously to engulf in ruin? Is
                  my heart an ocean? Ay, of love for you, Trustless! Ye had no faith, else would you
                  have cast yourself thereon and been<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC5981-00000149"/>
                  borne up safely. Drowned—drowned—drowned!—enough of water! How is it?
                  'Enough—enough of water hast thou!'—say it for me!"</p>
               <p>Helen's tears fell fast upon the sufferer. He shook them from his hands, and
                  raved—</p>
               <p>"The black waves of Acheron are the tears of eternal grief! Lamenting Cocytus
                  appals my soul with the howling of his surge! Pyriphlegethon rages against me!
                  Though I be cast away upon its sea of fire, my bones consume not! Dank airs howl
                  around me, yet refuse to lift the mirage, which veils the void empire toward which
                  I sail! There is a shadowy ferryman upon the shore! His grim eyes pierce the
                  gloom, and follow me, whirling—whirling through all the cycles of time upon this
                  flood of deadly hate; yet onward—onward! Where doth Lethe await the mariner?
                  Lethe, the blest, who hushes on her bosom the oppressions of many sorrows; who
                  washes out, with magic waves, the remembrance of dismal woe!"</p>
               <p>These frightful ravings dispelled the strange calm of Helen's mind. Her mental
                  exaltation passed away, leaving the poor enthusiast but a weak, sorrowing,
                  suffering, timid, tender woman. Here these young creatures learned their first
                  terrible lessons of mortality. Walsingham watched with them, partly because he
                  could not permit his darling to wrestle with her first sorrow, unsustained by his
                  presence, and partly because of the great interest he now felt in the poor youth
                  toward whom he had been unjust. The various inconsistencies which had displeased
                  him in Cola became reconciled, now that his position was explained; and, as
                  Viola's brother, he became an object of especial regard and care.</p>
               <p>"If we can calm him to sleep, there is hope," said Walsingham. "I will administer
                  this composing potion, and watch by him, myself; you, Helen, with Viola, must
                  retire."</p>
               <p>"I will stay," she said; and, seeing him about to refuse, added, resolutely, "Nay,
                  I <emph>will</emph> stay! death itself cannot be more still, than I."</p>
               <p>Walsingham was not a man accustomed to be defied; but there was something so
                  resolute and despairing in her face that he urged her no more. He compensated
                  himself by leading Viola and Mrs. Irving to the door, forstalling all objection by
                  saying, "It must be so. If you all remain, he will never sleep. I will come to you
                  with news of him. Good-night."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">EXPLANATIONS.</head>
               <p>TO the influence of medicine the terrible excitement yielded at last, and the
                  patient slept. The flush of fever faded from his face; cold dews stood upon his
                  forehead, and his features seemed emaciated as though by protracted suffering. In
                  his death-like repose he looked strangely like his dead mother. Walsingham was
                  surprised that he had never observed the likeness before, as his resemblance to
                  her, was greater than Viola's.</p>
               <p>This, then, was the son whose doubtful fate had disturbed the peace of that mother
                  in her dying hour. In whose behalf she had solicited the services of Walsingham,
                  should he ever be in a situation to afford them. Remembering that lorn death-bed,
                  he felt, as he sat by the couch of the young man whom he had rescued from death,
                  that this was another ward, strangely led to him by the hand of fate.</p>
               <p>But where had his childhood been sheltered? Who was educating his youth? Did the
                  father of these children live? and if so, would he claim Viola?</p>
               <p>In the adjoining room, she sat upon a low stool, her hand grasping the arm of an
                  easy-chair, and her head reclined against it. To Walsingham, who looked at her
                  through the open door, she pictured her own childhood. In that attitude it had
                  been her wont to nestle by his great chair, lost in her beautiful child reveries,
                  listening to his reading, or waiting for his caress. Would she, the child of his
                  heart, rejoice to find a father? Would she leave, willingly, the tenderness which
                  had girt her life, for the parent in whose heart nature had been dumb? He grew
                  jealous of the influence which this evil man might obtain over the youth and
                  innocence yonder, and wondered why a gift of Heaven, so precious, had been thus
                  misbestowed. He had schooled himself to the idea of resigning her to the husband
                  she might choose, because he believed her happiness demanded that; but this father
                  could only break her heart, as he had broken her mother's.</p>
               <p>And he gazed at her in the distance with a look so deep, so earnest, so sad, that
                  it penetrated her heart—she lifted her graceful head from its resting-place,
                  relinquished her hold upon the chair, and made a sign to him.</p>
               <p>He looked again upon the brother, locked in slumber profound, then upon Helen,
                  whose eyes were fastened on his face—whispered to the young watcher a few words of
                  comfort and hope, and obeyed the beckoning hand.</p>
               <p>She still sat upon the low stool, and he threw himself in<pb n="300-301"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000151"/> the vacant chair, and laid his hand upon hers, as
                  it grasped the arm. "Viola," he said, "have you a father?"</p>
               <p>The question was abrupt, and unlocked for, and she answered, in some surprise, "I
                  thought you knew all!"</p>
               <p>"Would to Heaven I had; it would have saved me some anxiety," he said.</p>
               <p>"There has been some misunderstanding," she whispered, "for which, I hope, I am
                  not to blame. Do you remember, one morning, when I came to your study with a
                  letter from <emph>him?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"It was with the intention of telling you my newly-acquired knowledge that I came,
                  but—"</p>
               <p>"But I prevented your narrative by saying that I knew all."</p>
               <p>She threw back her curls, and looked up in his face, with the old expression of
                  childish surprise upon her own, saying, "And did you not, sir?"</p>
               <p>"I? no! I supposed—well, no matter what! I misunderstood the facts. Have the
                  goodness to give me them now."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, when Cola Conway came to the Eyrie, with Howard, there was something
                  in his presence that troubled me. I felt confused—puzzled—at fault! A half
                  recollection haunted, yet continually eluded me. As Uncle Captain would say, he
                  reminded me of something I could not think of. When he sang that vesper song (you
                  remember it, don't you?) this entanglement of mind grew absolutely distressing,
                  until at last it broke into unravelment, and the remembrance after which my mind
                  was striving, came fully and fairly before it. A small fire-lit room, through
                  which floated that vesper melody, arose before me, and then, I knew it was the
                  song my mother used to sing her child; then, I knew it was of the beautiful lost
                  face that hovered about my earlier life, that the young stranger reminded me."</p>
               <p>"Did you think, then, that he was your brother?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no! I only felt drawn toward him, because of the taste which had treasured a
                  gem of music which had been a favourite with my mother.</p>
               <p>"I frequently besought him to sing it, because of the associations it had for me;
                  and one evening, when we had grown familiar, I told him how this song of his
                  affected me, and why. Then he told me that my story was like his own; that he,
                  too, had lost his mother early, but that he had no remembrance of her, and but few
                  mementoes. The song he had found among his father's papers, and he had taken
                  pleasure in singing it, because it was composed by the mother, whom he had never
                  known.</p>
               <p>"One day I wore a ring which, because of its quaint style, he admired. Upon
                  examining the cipher he said, 'Viola, would it distress you very much if I should
                  be your brother? I laughed, and told him I would adopt him, if he liked, but that
                  Providence had never permitted me relations.</p>
               <p>"'I think,' said he, solemnly, 'that He is sending you a near, and dear one, now!
                  I have a sister somewhere in this wide world, and that cipher tells me, you are
                  she. When my father died, he left me to the care of my uncle, and also the little
                  girl, if she could be found. There is a paper at home,<pb n="302-303"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000152"/> containing that which will establish her identity.
                  When I return, I shall read it eagerly; and if it confirms my belief, I will send
                  you a copy.'</p>
               <p>"When the paper, and Cola's letter, came, there was no longer any doubt upon my
                  mind, and I hastened to tell you I had found a brother. I may have been mistaken,
                  but you seemed pained when I opened the subject, and, I fancied, unwilling to hear
                  me speak upon it. You interrupted me, with the assurance that you knew all, and I
                  supposed you had recognised Cola to be my brother from the beginning, and probably
                  had never lost sight of him. Feeling a delicacy in obtruding a subject which
                  appeared to be distasteful, I was silent."</p>
               <p>Walsingham bit his lip, as he thought of the sharp agony which smote him upon that
                  well remembered morning, when she came, as his jealous fears suggested, to confide
                  to him a tale of love.</p>
               <p>"There is one thing that puzzles me in this affair," said he. "Why, did you keep
                  your discovered relationship secret from your other friends? It would have been
                  natural to have proclaimed it at once."</p>
               <p>Viola's eyes sought the ground.</p>
               <p>"That was my impulse; but I felt it was due to you to be first consulted. Our
                  interview was so strangely constrained, that I became embarrassed, and could
                  neither express my own feelings, nor discover yours. I believed, however, that you
                  were unwilling to have known, that which had so long been concealed.</p>
               <p>"I have accustomed myself to divine your thoughts when you are chary in
                  expression," she added, with a smile; "but do you know, upon this occasion, I
                  fancied there was something in your mind, which you determined I should not
                  perceive, and therefore made our interview as brief as possible. I may have been
                  wrong."</p>
               <p>"You were not wrong, Viola."</p>
               <p>What was it which he had desired to hide from her? She looked up inquiringly. She
                  was a natural physiognomist, and in the study of his countenance was practised.
                  Had she ever read one secret there?</p>
               <p>As she sat in her low stool by his side, with upturned face, he looked down into
                  the depths of her wondering eyes; in a steadfast gaze, each strove to read the
                  heart of the other. The prolonged scrutiny brought no new knowledge to either. He
                  saw no shadow of her inner thought upon her confiding, childlike face; she saw
                  only the pallor of midnight study, the lines of earnest meditation, upon his calm,
                  inscrutable countenance.</p>
               <p>She averted her eyes at length, and he fancied a tremor thrilled the small hand
                  which lay beneath his own. With a sudden impulse, he took it between his, saying,
                  "Viola, you were ever truthful! answer me this. Did you never divine that one
                  thing which I strove to conceal?"</p>
               <p>She did not lift her eyes from the ground, and was silent.</p>
               <p>"Answer me, as truthfully as a novice at confessional, or refuse to answer at
                  all."</p>
               <p>"I thought that I did," she said.</p>
               <p>The usually calm pulses of Walsingham would not have<pb n="304-305"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000153"/> beaten so fast, but that he believed the hour for
                  love's fruition had come to him, at last.</p>
               <p>"I thought," said Viola, with her girlish candour, "that you loved me—"</p>
               <p>"Heaven knows how well!" he cried, with fervour.</p>
               <p>"And that you were unwilling to part with me."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes!"</p>
               <p>"I thought that you knew that my uncle would claim me when he became aware of my
                  existence, and therefore you desired to keep my identity a secret."</p>
               <p>He threw himself back in his chair, letting her hand fall.</p>
               <p>"Was I right?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"That I loved you," he answered with an effort, "yes; that I was unwilling to part
                  with you, yes! But that I would retain possession of, or influence over you, by
                  the concealment of anything proper to be known, or by other than open, honourable
                  means, <emph>no!</emph> Viola, you are as a little child!"</p>
               <p>There was an impatience in the utterance of the last sentence, which her ear was
                  quick to detect, and she retorted with sudden bitterness,</p>
               <p>"I have grown to womanhood under your very eye, yet you will not see it."</p>
               <p>And as she arose to her full height, and swept away, she looked indeed a woman. He
                  marvelled at the change in her, who, a moment before, sat at his feet, with her
                  young face upturned for his reading.</p>

               <p>IF a momentary passion had agitated Viola, it was hushed, when she stood in the
                  quiet room where Cola still slept, and Helen watched. She approached the bed with
                  a feeling of self-condemnation, for having entertained in her heart, aught save
                  love, and prayer for him.</p>
               <p>The fearful excitement had passed away; the fever was allayed, and his pallid and
                  profound repose seemed more like death, than sleep. There was something awful in
                  the outstretched and motionless figure, revealed through snowy drapery, looking as
                  though for ever beyond the reach of pain. The ashen face, the pale hands, meekly
                  resting on the breast, seemed folded to an endless repose. Break the frightful
                  calm that chains volition! wail, moan, cry aloud! that love<pb n="306-307"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000154"/> may know ye have not lost the capacity to suffer!
                  Be not thus stark and still, as though reposing in the last terrible immunity from
                  sorrow!</p>
               <p>The burden of that night's nameless fears, these two young watchers bore together.
                  Walsingham paced the adjoining room, occasionally approaching the group to assure
                  himself that all continued well. The shadows of night dispersed at last, and joy
                  came in the morning, for the peril was past.</p>
               <p>When Viola had collected her scattered thoughts, she essayed to write an account
                  of her brother's adventure to the uncle, whom she had never seen. Hers, was the
                  pen of a ready writer; but on this occasion it seemed stupid, and utterly dumb. It
                  is an easy thing to write to a friend whose character you understand. Avoiding all
                  that would offend, and ministering graciously to the well known tastes, you may
                  glide through your story to a pleasant ending, without constraint, or fear. It is
                  comparatively easy, to give a verbal narrative to an utter stranger, because the
                  first glance gives you some clue to his character, and the variable expressions of
                  his face encourage you to proceed, or warn to desist. But, for a young girl, to
                  make, by letter, an important communication to one whom she has never seen, and
                  who she is most anxious should regard her with favour, is a most embarrassing
                  duty. So Viola felt it, as she sat by the window, dipping her pen in ink, and
                  patiently holding it, until the fluid evaporated into air instead of words.</p>
               <p>This uncle had been a man of high official station, whose gifts and eccentricities
                  had rendered him a theme of private conversation, as well as newspaper discussion.
                  Thus she became familiar with his fame, before she knew of the tie between herself
                  and him. After she had discovered her relationship, Cola, in reply to her eager
                  questions, had given her as fair an account as it was possible for him to do.
                  Respecting his uncle profoundly, Cola did not in the least comprehend his very
                  remarkable character; and from all which he told her, Viola conceived a vague awe
                  for her mysterious relative, whom she now felt it her duty to address.</p>
               <p>He was a man of stern, yet fervent nature. One who pursued the path of duty with
                  unhesitating rectitude; taking no delight therein, yet shrinking from no sacrifice
                  which it might demand. If roses nodded by the wayside, making it a path of
                  pleasantness, their beauty and perfume were unseen, unfelt by him, because of the
                  steadfastness with which his gaze was fixed upon the end. If burning ploughshares
                  paved the pathway, his heroic soul neither shrank nor faltered. Stern,
                  uncompromising with himself, so was he with all mankind: and from his judicial
                  station he dealt the terrors of the law with awful justice. Human sympathy, with
                  human weakness, he felt not. The temptations of tried nature never won compassion.
                  The league of besetting circumstances could nought extenuate. He was clothed with
                  authority to punish, not to pity.</p>
               <p>Men honoured this man for his unfaltering rectitude, and lofty virtue, yet
                     <emph>none loved him.</emph> Trusts were reposed in him, confidences bestowed
                  on him, labours demanded of him, and<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC5981-00000155"/>
                  with energetic zeal he met the requirements of all, disappointing none. But no
                  wife smiled in his eyes, or sweetened his labour with love; no child, on its
                  embassy of blessing, came fresh from Heaven to his joyless home; no friend sat by
                  his side in the twilight, and bade him revive his drooping energies in the
                  refreshment of kindred companionship.</p>
               <p>If his heart sometimes clamoured within him for sympathy, it was hushed with
                  tasks: and it came to pass that the repressed instincts of his nature avenged
                  themselves upon this tyranny. As the limb, compressed by art from infancy, and
                  prevented its natural development in one part, will outgrow its fair proportion,
                  and swell to the superabundance of deformity in another, so the repressed
                  yearnings of this man, forced from their natural growth, developed themselves in
                  an unlooked-for and monstrous manner. Steeled against the sweet influences of
                  daily life, he grew strangely susceptible to that of unseen, and intangible
                  things. Checked, and hedged in a narrow limit of the visible world, his soul
                  vaulted to an ideal realm, and held high revel there. He called aloud from out his
                  solitude, and, to his distempered thoughts, the disembodied spirits of air made
                  answer. He summoned, with a whisper which rang through space, the souls of heroes
                  and martyrs, and from the unbroken repose of centuries they arose and answered. He
                  called upon the names of departed kindred, and, bending low from heaven, they made
                  response.</p>
               <p>Men said "much learning had made him mad," and he answered, "I am <emph>not</emph>
                  mad, but speak the words of truth and soberness!" Yet, feeling that mankind, not
                  sharing his strange belief, must distrust his judgment, he resigned official
                  honours and private trusts; thus laying all that had adorned his life upon the
                  altar of his new faith.</p>
               <p>No marvel that Viola hesitated to address this mysterious man; no marvel that she
                  sat by the window, watching the shadow on the dial move toward the hour of noon,
                  and the pen still dry in her hand. But it was a marvel that, as she gazed forth in
                  perplexity, she saw a figure moving up the avenue, which her intuition told her
                  was the man of whom she meditated.</p>
               <p>He was small and slightly bent—not with infirmity, but with the energy of onward
                  progress. His countenance was dark and haggard, but his deep-set eyes were keenly
                  fixed upon some point in the distance, toward which he seemed to move. So, with
                  his long hair, and beard, streaming backward in the wind, he pressed on, and
                  passed beneath the window.</p>
               <p>Viola laid down her pen, with the conviction that this new Presence absorbed her
                  from the duty of using it, and sought the chamber of her brother.</p>

               <p>ONWARD—through hall, and stairway, and passage, pressed this Presence, as though
                  in obedience to a command recorded in high Heaven, when the foundations of the
                  world were laid. Through the open door, past the startled inmates, across the
                  spacious chamber, and stood beside the bed. There was something thing so ethereal
                  in the apparition, that it seemed as if a spirit had glided past.</p>
               <p>"You called me in extremity, three nights ago, and I have come!"</p>
               <p>Cola, now restored to sense, but fearfully enfeebled, opened his eyes, smiled in
                  recognition, and essayed to speak.</p>
               <p>"I have been—in—"</p>
               <p>"In many perils, you would say, but cannot. Be not troubled, for I know all, and
                  therefore am I here. <emph>Sleep!</emph>"</p>
               <p>There was an air of ghostly omniscience in his words, that almost curdled the
                  blood of listeners.</p>
               <p>As unmindful of all about him, as if he stood alone by the sick man, he felt his
                  pulse, smoothed the hair from his brow, and muttered, "It is well! his hour has
                  not come;" and vanished.</p>
               <p>No words convey an idea of the peculiarity of his movements, so well as those
                  which usage has consecrated to descriptions of the disembodied.</p>
               <p>They knew within that chamber that he walked out, through the open door, as he had
                  entered, yet a vague awe possessed them, as though an apparition had passed.</p>
               <p>Walsingham arose and followed. He overtook him in the hall. "I presume I address
                  Judge Conway," he said.</p>
               <p>The stranger bowed his head with the air of one who had been interrupted in some
                  absorbing thought, by a trivial question.</p>
               <p>"You have travelled fast and far, and must be weary. The lady of this house
                  commissions me to offer you refreshment."</p>
               <p>The strange man was looking at the door; nay, through the<pb n="312-313"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000157"/> planks, to him transparent, away into the wintry
                  landscape beyond. He declined the proffered refreshment with a gesture, and
                  continued his steadfast gaze.</p>
               <p>"Then, sir, have the goodness to enter, and be seated," continued Walsingham,
                  throwing open the drawing-room door. "I have much to communicate concerning your
                  nephew."</p>
               <p>The stranger shook his head: "You can tell me nothing that I do not know."</p>
               <p>"The intelligence has travelled with unwonted rapidity to reach your home; or were
                  you met by it on your way hither?"</p>
               <p>With his dreamy eyes still fixed upon that ever-distant point in space, he
                  answered, with simple brevity, "I was <emph>there,</emph> and
                  <emph>saw.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"<emph>There, and saw?</emph>" echoed Walsingham.</p>
               <p>"Yes. Spiritually present; I saw the turgid waves, the drifts of ice, the wreck
                  and spoil of waters; the boat a whirling toy of wind and wave; the despairing face
                  lifted in agony; the arms reached forth in supplication. Saw <emph>you</emph>
                  this?" and he turned, with fierce interrogation, to Walsingham.</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>The sudden excitement passed as quickly as it came, and with his usual cold,
                  sepulchral tone he added, "One other witness was there, concerning whom the powers
                  of darkness hold council. Well for you, that you are not he."</p>
               <p>"Permit me to beg, you will explain how you became spiritually present at this
                  scene?" inquired Walsingham, his stately courtesy contrasting with the wild
                  abruptness of his guest.</p>
               <p>The shadowy Presence glided through the open door, and hovered over the seat which
                  Walsingham proffered.</p>
               <p>"It was very simple," he said; "I was alone, in the twilight, thinking earnestly
                  of him, when the cry of his despair smote my ear."</p>
               <p>"In your own home, two hundred miles away?"</p>
               <p>"Why not? When such a sound falls upon the atmosphere it surges in circumambient
                  waves, which, growing finer and less, by small degrees, still ripple to the
                  remotest verge of space. Gross ears are filled with the shock of common sound, but
                  there is a finer sense, which when attentive, thrills to the whispers which fill
                  the universe."</p>
               <p>"When I heard that call, I bent the whole energies of my nature to answer with my
                  presence; and <emph>I was there!</emph>"</p>
               <p>The glow of enthusiasm faded, and with some bitterness, he continued—</p>
               <p>"I have answered you, because it is part of my creed to impart truth to the
                  searcher after knowledge, but you cannot understand, and will not believe. Your
                  faith, like that of your race, is prisoned within the limits of a finite
                  comprehension, and is <emph>dead</emph> to the vast infinitude beyond."</p>
               <p>As Walsingham listened he inquired of himself, "Is this mad enthusiast the man
                  selected by her father, to dispute with me the guardianship of Viola?" He had
                  followed him from the sick-room with the intention of unfolding to him the history
                  of his niece, and rendering an account of his stewardship, but he now hesitated;
                  the man seemed brain-sick, bereft of judgment, and hardly to be approached with
                  concerns like<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC5981-00000158"/> these. Reflecting,
                  however, that despite his mental vagaries, he had been always a good and just man,
                  fulfilling worthily the trusts reposed in him, Walsingham resolved to deal with
                  him as with any other man, and at once approached the subject.</p>
               <p>"With information, as thorough and accurate as you possess, it is unnecessary for
                  me to tell you of your nephew's present position, with regard to a lady."</p>
               <p>"I am not informed upon that point," said he, withdrawing his eyes from that
                  distant focus upon which they were ever fixed, and looking in Walsingham's face
                  with a certain kindling of human interest.</p>
               <p>"Then you are not aware of his attachment to the daughter of the gentleman in
                  whose house we are?" said Walsingham, reluctant to make his communication at
                  once.</p>
               <p>The look of interest faded, and an expression of languor and weariness passed over
                  the haggard face. "My instincts have been at fault," he said. "I thought it was of
                  another female I was about to hear."</p>
               <p>"May I inquire whom?"</p>
               <p>"The lad's sister, whom I have never seen, and whose guardian I am. Two years ago,
                  when I first became aware of the communications between the material and
                  immaterial world, I consulted the spirit of her father, and was directed to seek
                  her here. I traversed this valley, but failed to meet the object of my
                  search."</p>
               <p>"Could the spirit have been mistaken?" suggested Walsingham.</p>
               <p>The enthusiast smiled with ineffable pity, at the grossness of his ignorance!</p>
               <p>"Those who dwell in the day-beams of knowledge cannot err, though their humble
                  mediums in the fetters of flesh may. I was a novice then in knowledge."</p>
               <p>"When the communications from the invisible world became more clear to you, why
                  did you not renew the search?"</p>
               <p>"Because the discouragement of the first failure oppressed me. But your question,
                  is one that my brother will ask me in the spirit world, and I must again make the
                  effort."</p>
               <p>Turning away from Walsingham, with a gesture of silence, he fixed his hollow eyes
                  once more upon some visionary and distant point in space, and gazed and meditated.
                  His face grew ashen and blank, his eyeballs stony, and he seemed rigid, like one
                  in a convulsion. Walsingham was about to call for aid, when the door opened, and
                  Viola entered. He sprang between the stranger and his ward, that she might be
                  spared the shock of seeing him in his terrible trance, saying, as he did so, "Why
                  have you come?"</p>
               <p>A tremor agitated the frame, while a slight convulsion passed over the face of the
                  mysterious man, and the trance was over. His voice, low and dirge-like, answered
                  the question:—</p>
               <p>"Because it was my <emph>will.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Thinking it wisest to make no allusion to the strange affection he had witnessed,
                  Walsingham led Viola forward, and introduced her as "Miss Walsingham."</p>
               <pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC5981-00000159"/>
               <p>This was her mother's maiden name, and, at her request, Viola had known no
                  other.</p>
               <p>"Viola Conway, welcome!" said the mystic, taking her trembling hand in his cold
                  corpse-like clasp. "In visions of the night I have seen you, and spirits of air
                  have heralded your approach. Behold in me, the guardian appointed you by your dead
                  father."</p>
               <p>To Viola, the name of her father was a spell of dread, and, it is to be feared,
                  she regarded his agent as a fanatical madman. She said, timidly,</p>
               <p>"This—this is my guardian, sir."</p>
               <p>"For the care with which you have discharged duties that were mine, be thanked,"
                  he said, inclining slightly toward Walsingham. "Henceforth I shall relieve you of
                  the charge."</p>
               <p>Viola looked imploringly at her earliest, best friend.</p>
               <p>When did he ever fail to respond to look, or wish of hers? He took her hand, and
                  drew it through his arm, with an air of protection that seemed to say, "Rest on
                  me;" and answered:—</p>
               <p>"This young lady was given to my care by her mother. She has sat by my board,
                  grown under my roof-tree, and been to me a daughter. If the faithful discharge of
                  a guardian's sacred duties, in time past, give me a claim to consideration, I ask
                  you to continue mine office. I have lived too much for her, to live without her
                  now."</p>
               <p>In the utterance of the last sentence his fine voice faltered, with the emotion
                  which he had so often successfully controlled. As the accents struck Viola's ear,
                  conveying to her quick apprehension hension a sudden conviction of all that had
                  been so long hidden, a delicate roseate glow suffused her face, and her lips
                  parted with a smile. Oblivious of her recent fear, she stood with her hand upon
                  his arm, like an Empress at her coronation. For why? Her womanhood that moment
                  received its crown. <emph>He had lived too long for her, to live without her
                     now!</emph> What an acknowledgment of her supremacy was this! What unconscious
                  words of fealty had he spoken!</p>
               <p>"I thank you for the past," said the impassible figure, in reply, "but the future
                  will be my care. I am pledged to the dead."</p>
               <p>"Reflect," exclaimed Walsingham. "To you she will be a burden; to me a blessing.
                  You, are unused to minister to delicate womanly requirements; I, for her sake,
                  have studied them. You, have no home to offer her, while in mine, a place filled
                  by her presence becomes void, if you rob me of her. Is it not more convenient for
                  you, and better for me, that she should remain?"</p>
               <p>This was a lover pleading for his mistress, albeit he knew it not.</p>
               <p>"It is as you say," said the shadow, gloomily. "She will be to me an unaccustomed
                  burden; but when I render an account of my stewardship in Heaven, can I say, I did
                  not execute thy will because it was not convenient? The way is dark and thorny;
                  the burdens are neither few nor light. Those which are heaven-appointed, the
                  sophistry of man shall not tempt me to lay down.</p>
               <p>"As for the daughter of Miles Conway, she must be content<pb n="318-319"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000160"/> tent with such protection and comfort, as the man,
                  selected by her father, can offer. Be she luxurious, she must conform to the life
                  of an ascetic. Be she tender, she must grow hardy. Be she dependent, she must
                  learn self-reliance; and become, perchance, a wiser, better woman, than those who
                  are clad in fine linen, and dwell in kings' houses."</p>
               <p>And while this cold, hard arbiter of her destiny thus sternly spoke, Viola still
                  smiled her rosy, happy smile. The murmur of his voice in her ear was meaningless.
                  She was queening it in her new-found realm! What room for care, or fear, was there
                  in the heart which knew itself beloved?</p>
               <p>"Is this your fixed determination?" Walsingham asked.</p>
               <p>"It is."</p>
               <p>"I have thus far appealed to you," he said, with resolution, "because I recognised
                  the superior right of a father to dispose of his child. I now give you notice,
                  that I will not relinquish her but at the mandate of the law; and if you make the
                  issue, I shall show desertion of duty, and unworthiness on the part of the parent,
                  and unfitness and incapacity in his agent."</p>
               <p>A dark flush passed over the bloodless face of the claimant. "You would avail
                  yourself of popular prejudice, and prove me mad," he said, bitterly. "To this
                  Moloch of ignorance, I have offered up every right, every trust, and only withhold
                  this, because I stand pledged to the dead. In proof of capacity to discharge my
                  duties, I point to this girl's brother. He stands a living testimony, of care, as
                  judicious, as it has been complete. I <emph>will</emph> make the issue, and if the
                  law absolve from my trust, I, who have administered the law, am law-abiding;" and
                  with his ghost-like, noiseless movement, he faded from the room.</p>
               <p>Oh, Viola, Viola! With the sick brother tremblingly turning from the threshold of
                  eternity—with the agents of buried parents rudely contending for thee—why does thy
                  bosom thrill with ecstasy? thy cheek wear the radiance of joy? Why, in the
                  solitude of thy chamber, dost thou clasp thy joyful hands, and lift thy exultant
                  heart, in a rapture of thanksgiving?</p>
               <p>Oh, Viola! Oh, woman? Thou dost know thyself to be beloved! Thou, who hast been
                  groping in the twilight of thy unconscious heart, hast had, by a lightning's
                  flash, the glorious surroundings of youth and love revealed! That, which seemed,
                  in the half light through which thou hast walked, duty, gratitude, filial
                  devotion, on thy part; in this sudden illumination takes its true outline, and
                  stands confessed, the first deep, earnest love of woman. That, which in him, wore
                  the semblance of patience, indulgence, and faithful recognition of obligation,
                  grows into largeness of stature, and reveals itself the great, absorbing passion
                  of man!</p>
               <p>She knew, now, why she trembled, and grew incoherent in his presence, when she
                  would have told him of her new relations. She knew, too, why he had checked her
                  speech, and misunderstood her import. She knew the cause of that serene happiness
                  which had so long filled her heart. She knew—oh, what, in this flooding of light,
                  did she not see, and know!</p>

               <p>COLA, from day to day, improved. When health once more returned to the severely
                  tried system of this young man, happiness came with it, hand in hand. No more
                  coldness on the part of friends. No more misunderstandings as before. His love
                  acknowledged, accepted, and approved, left him nothing more to ask for; and to his
                  delicious convalescence we leave him.</p>
               <p>Yet, stay! The position of Viola, and the difference between his uncle and
                  Walsingham, occasioned him pain. Cola had never been wanting in affection or
                  respect for his uncle, but the reflections of a sick couch had brought him a
                  better understanding of that uncle's character, and a greater tenderness for his
                  eccentricities. He remembered how he had sacrificed ease, and convenience, to give
                  to himself the care and education which his tender years, and more matured youth,
                  required. How he had resigned position, honours, and influence, rather than be
                  false to a conviction of his mind. However strange or monstrous his belief might
                  be, it was the honest irresistible conviction of the man, and his fealty to it was
                  noble. That fealty had cost him all that the earlier labours of his life had won.
                  The <emph>belief</emph> was false, but the <emph>man</emph> was <emph>true.</emph>
                  The world had not distinguished between the man and his belief; hence, he was
                  regarded as an impostor, and exposed to contumely. Cola, while deploring his
                  views, admired the immovable devotion with which he had maintained them; and,
                  seeing how he had sacrificed to them all which men value, a compassionate
                  tenderness toward him grew up in his heart, and he desired to shield him from the
                  pitiless scorn of the world. It pained him to think that Walsingham, who had
                  always been his model of manhood, and toward whom he felt an equal degree of
                  gratitude on behalf of his sister; that Walsingham should be in antagonism with
                  his relative; should lay bare his errors; should triumph over, and inflict new
                  mortification upon the isolated and joyless man.</p>
               <p>He talked of these things with Viola, and she, who had also been pondering them,
                  soothed his apprehensions, and assured him they should never be realized. She
                  promised that her<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC5981-00000162"/> uncle and Walsingham
                  should never contend together, but be friends, etc.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Viola, if it depended upon Walsingham, your influence over him would justify
                  your assurance; but you do not know the stuff our uncle is made of. He thinks it
                  his duty to assume the authority of a guardian over his new-found ward. He will
                  promptly resort to legal measures to establish his claim, and, in defence of his
                  own right, Walsingham will not spare him. Our uncle will be presented to the
                  consideration of the world as a misguided, half-crazed fanatic, while our
                  father—he was an unnatural father to you, they say, Viola, and it will strengthen
                  Walsingham to prove it;—but can we—can <emph>you,</emph> endure this
                  exposure?"</p>
               <p>"Dear Cola, why will you torture your sick brain with impossibilities? I tell you
                  these things shall never be."</p>
               <p>"You are half a sorceress, sister mine," responded he, with his old lightness of
                  manner. "But how are you to charm away these troubles?"</p>
               <p>"You do not see! and it so simple—so easy! What say you to my going voluntarily
                  with my uncle and brother?"</p>
               <p>"Viola! you do not mean it! you could not do it! you ought not, if you would!"</p>
               <p>"And why not?" she inquired, with the coolest possible smile.</p>
               <p>"Walsingham would as soon part with his life's blood; and you owe him everything;
                  and—well—no matter! Go with us? why our cold, gloomy, ascetic home would be no
                  home for such a summer bird. Don't think of that, Viola."</p>
               <p>"My home shall be wherever I choose to make it," she said. "Mr. Walsingham will be
                  influenced by my wish rather than his own; and, for the sake of our uncle, who has
                  been the only and true friend of my brother's childhood; who would have been the
                  protector of mine; and to preserve from comment or reproach the name of the father
                  whom we knew not; and, for other reasons, which I need not mention now (her colour
                  rose, and she spoke rapidly here), I will accept the protection which his last
                  thoughts bespoke.</p>
               <p>"Are these not motives sufficiently strong to lead me from a luxurious home, to a
                  hard one? Then remember, Cola, when I come it will be changed. Containing a woman,
                  it can no longer be gloomy and joyless. We are treasures of domestic life, you
                  must understand. We do not go through life selecting sunny spots upon which to
                  pitch our tents, but we fill with the light, and love, of our presence, the waste
                  places which may be appointed us.</p>
               <p>"A precious pair of bachelors I shall have in you and our uncle; but if I fail in
                  teaching you to appreciate my sex, why, Helen shall be added to our household, and
                  it may be, she will succeed where I fail. Then you, and she, shall coo together in
                  one corner of the chimney, while I shall darn my uncle's hose in the other, and he
                  shall be sleek, and fat, and shave his beard, and trim his hair, and grow
                  benevolent in aspect, as well-cared for middle-aged gentlemen do, and—and—;" and
                  Viola's emotions, at her own touching picture, prevented her saying more.</p>
               <p>Her manner, though half playful and half sad, was resolute<pb n="324-325"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000163"/> lute, and Cola perceived she had reflected upon the
                  peculiarities of her position, and decided upon her course. Those "other reasons"
                  slightly alluded to, were perhaps the deepest, as they were the most delicate,
                  which influenced her.</p>
               <p>When Viola became fully aware of the change which had taken place in the relations
                  between Walsingham, and herself; when she had had some faint glimpses of the
                  adoration with which he regarded her, and, from the quick responses of her own
                  heart, found that he indeed had grown into her life, as she in his—when she thus
                  learned that they were not merely guardian and ward, but lovers—the delicate
                  instincts of womanhood suggested it was unmeet that his house should be her
                  home—that his protection should shelter her, as heretofore. There was no longer
                  the calm repose of home, beneath his roof. Her pulses beat not so equally in his
                  presence: she could not meet him in the hall, or sit with him at the board, as
                  before: she was filled with a sweet dread of his coming, and feared to be alone
                  with him, whose presence was most dear.</p>
               <p>She knew that Walsingham loved her; she believed it had long been so, but that he
                  would ever be other than he had always been to her—calm, dignified,
                  impenetrable—she did not believe. Without understanding that secret reason, which
                  was the foundation-stone of his reserve, her faith in him was so implicit that she
                  acquiesced fully in the wisdom and propriety of his conduct. She did not desire to
                  see him play the lover. It was enough, oh! too much happiness to know herself
                  beloved by such a man.</p>
               <p>But her tenderness, though humble and unexacting, was irrepressible. Aiming, as
                  with commendable pride she did, to emulate the example of reserve which he had set
                  her, she feared lest the love which pervaded her being should, by some unguarded
                  look, tone, or gesture betray itself—betray <emph>her.</emph> Not for worlds, upon
                  worlds, would she have him guess it. Their intercourse had been so pure, so
                  perfect, so happy—so beautiful to remember, that she dreaded it should be marred
                  by mortifying weakness on her part, or embarrassing knowledge on his; and this was
                  that "other reason" why she would accept the protection of her uncle.</p>
               <p>She was thankful that the Providence who had watched her always, had provided a
                  new home for her when she needed it. Thankful that the awakening had not come
                  before the asylum was offered. Believing it to be sent by Heaven, in answer to her
                  need, she resolved to accept it. She would go hence, bearing in her heart the
                  conviction of his deep love for her; the delicious memory of years of intercourse;
                  and her own reverence, trust, and love; and with these be happy. She was grateful
                  that she had known him, and been the recipient of his tenderness so long; grateful
                  for the impress of his mind upon her own; grateful for the influence which he
                  would for ever exert over her life, though they should never meet more. She would
                  write to him, and he to her. She would hear of him from the world, in which he had
                  now become distinguished, and she would read his books. It would be very hard to
                  learn to live away from him, but knowing her<pb n="326-327"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000164"/> heart, how could she trust herself with him? and so
                  her mind was fixed.</p>
               <p>It was with difficulty that she explained her purpose to Walsingham. A difficulty
                  greatly increased by his surprise, and pain. As she anticipated, he submitted to
                  her decision, although he neither concurred in its propriety, nor appreciated the
                  reasons by which it was sustained.</p>
               <p>"Must I," he said, looking sadly and tenderly in her face, "must I, then, resign
                  my little girl at last? No power on earth could force me to this but her own wish.
                  That has always been to me an irresistible fiat."</p>
               <p>Viola, with downcast eyes, sat trembling and blushing like a culprit, as he
                  continued—</p>
               <p>"Bear me witness, Viola, that since I knew you, your well-being and happiness has
                  been the aim of a life which you now leave purposeless."</p>
               <p>She covered her face with her hands, and sobbed. He smoothed the hair from her hot
                  brow, soothingly, saying—"I would not make my darling weep, and will therefore say
                  little more. I must remind her that she leaves me of her own deliberate will, and,
                  as I think, without sufficient cause. If, hereafter, she should be less happy in
                  the home she seeks than in the one she left, or if her judgment, cooler and more
                  matured, should repent the decision it has made, then, in justice to me, I ask her
                  to retrace her steps. In the name of all the past, I bid her remember that she
                  owes me that!</p>
               <p>"In the hope that that time will come, her tastes shall continue to regulate my
                  household—her seat shall remain vacant at the board—her place by the hearthstone
                  be consecrated to her coming. Flowers of welcome shall garnish my hall by day, and
                  hospitable fires glow therein by night. And night or day—summer or winter,
                  expectation shall watch in my heart, and hope whisper ever, '<emph>she is at
                     hand!</emph>'"</p>
               <p>Oh, modest womanhood! I do thee reverence! thou fragile, yet strong! How the
                  lonely, longing, loving, passionate heart, that would have cast itself upon his
                  noble breast, and pulsed its life out, was by thy force restrained! In that hour
                  of sweet temptation, she knew that her resolve was right. She dared not live with
                  him on the old terms. How she could have lived with him in the beautiful bond
                  which blends two harmonious lives in one!</p>
               <p>Women are excellent dissemblers! Viola conquered the tumult in her heart, and hid
                  its traces. She might not have been successful, but that Walsingham was absorbed
                  in the same battle with himself. The silent constraint of the one, the mournful
                  tenderness of the other, gave no indication of the strife within. Why did not some
                  sudden flash reveal to each the struggling heart of the other? This might have
                  been, had his love, been less self-abnegating, or hers, less modest.</p>
               <p>She took his hand as might a daughter, and kissed it reverently (coldly, he
                  thought, but his pulse was hot), and fearing to speak, left him.</p>

               <p>"JIM," said Mrs. Grey, folding her hands on the edge of the table, where the bird
                  was perched, and resting her chin upon them, that she might look into his wierd
                  eyes, "Jim, they say you know more'n a Christian bird ought; for goodness' sake
                  relieve my mind, can't you?"</p>
               <p>His wicked little eyes gave a sardonic twinkle.</p>
               <p>"I'll bet my knitting sheath," said his confiding mistress, gathering up her yarn,
                  and clicking her needles, "that <emph>you</emph> know what has been going on, down
                  in the town yonder, for a week past. But here you sit, and mope, when the family's
                  away, and the bridge they was to come home by gone, and the river chock full of
                  ice, so that no mortal can cross; and not a way for us to hear of 'em or 'em to
                  hear of us, unless you'd stir your stumps and go yourself, with my kompliments and
                  all's well, and hoping they is the same, and wouldn't Mr. Walsingham drop a line
                  by the bearer, saying so; which would be no more'n natural in you, Jim."</p>
               <p>Jim might have been dead, and stuffed, for all the response he made.</p>
               <p>"You're an able, but not a willin', which is a bad thing to say of man, or beast,
                  or bird either," continued the old lady, who entertained a more elevated opinion
                  of the sagacity, than the good feeling of her precious pet.</p>
               <p>Jim stretched his wings lazily, and shook himself into the most unseemly heap of
                  undressed feathers imaginable. The bird was suffering ennui.</p>
               <p>"Gracious, but I wish <emph>I</emph> had 'em!" said his mistress, alluding to the
                  wings, not to the plumage. "I'd go where I wanted to go, independent of
                  bridges.</p>
               <p>"But no matter now," she continued, reverently, "there's a pair awaitin' for me,
                  maybe! You'll live to Metheusalem's age, they say, and flutter and flourish, long
                  after your poor mistress is done carin' for you; but those wings of yourn must
                  come to dust at last, while mine—well, mine, will fly so far the wings of time
                  hisself shall never overtake."</p>
               <p>Exalted as this view of her superiority appeared, it filled Mrs. Grey with
                  melancholy. She took off her spectacles and wiped her eyes, while Jim, unmoved by
                  her touching remarks, pecked lazily at a few crumbs. His indifference was
                  exasperating. Mrs. Grey felt it.</p>
               <pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC5981-00000166"/>
               <p>"You stone—you rock—you granite!" she said. "You haint human feelin's! What is it
                  to you, whether the master and mistress, who have made so much of you, ever get
                  home again? What is it to you, if I should be dead and gone, I'd like to
                  know?"</p>
               <p>Upon this suggestion there was an instantaneous change in the bird. He folded his
                  glossy feathers smoothly upon his back, gathered his wings neatly to their place,
                  and hopped slowly, solemnly across the table. Mrs. Grey was in the habit of giving
                  to his actions her own interpretation. There was, to her affectionate heart,
                  something inexpressibly touching in this movement. It signified, that when she was
                  dead and gone, Jim would be chief mourner; and she lifted the sombre mute to her
                  bosom, ejaculating, with poetic alliteration,</p>
               <p>"You blessed black brute!"</p>
               <p>At this moment the door opened, and Walsingham entered.</p>
               <p>After a week of anxiety, loneliness, and apprehension, and in her present tender
                  mood, the surprise was too much for Mrs. Grey, and she burst into tears.</p>
               <p>Common as are these demonstrations, bachelors always find them embarrassing.
                  Walsingham was fresh from his interview with Viola, and his heart was full of its
                  own bitterness; but he could not but pause to soothe his humble friend, and listen
                  to her account of the mental distresses, the lugubrious possibilities and
                  probabilities which had beset her during the absence of the family.</p>
               <p>"Indeed, sir, I said to Jim—Jim, says I, if it was not for the bow and the
                  promise, I should look to see the waters creeping, creeping up the rocks, and
                  licking the Eyrie doorstep, as in Noah's time."</p>
               <p>When Mrs. Grey had talked her fill, and informed herself upon various points of
                  interest connected with the world from which he came, Walsingham made his escape
                  from the excellent, albeit garrulous lady, and, locking the door of his retreat,
                  was at last alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>Alone!</emph> This was a luxury. Of late, he had lived in the presence of
                  others. The cares, the courtesies, the amenities of life had claimed his
                  attention, while the strongest feelings of his nature were at war within him. So
                  perfect, and so practised was the self-control of this man, that he rendered to
                  each and all their due. To Cola, almost womanly forethought and tenderness; to
                  Helen, playful badinage; to Howard, patient and dignified hearing; and to
                  Viola—Viola, in whose presence the conflict waged mightiest—to Viola, calm
                  kindness, tender reserve.</p>
               <p>In the midst of this, the time for him to lose his darling had suddenly overtaken
                  him. Then the supremacy over self almost tottered within him, and he sought that
                  solitude in which he had always grown strong.</p>
               <p>He sat in Viola's boudoir. It had formerly been his study, and the scene of many a
                  midnight vigil, many a mental conflict, in which his nobler nature never failed to
                  triumph over the temptations which beleaguered it. Here, years ago, he had read
                  the letters of his first love, and taken a long, sad, farewell retrospect of that
                  era of life. Here, he sat in the golden twilights of summers long gone, with the
                  cherub on<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC5981-00000167"/> his knee, whose childish
                  eloquence of prattle sunk into his heart with a strange potency, dissipating
                  doubt, gloom, despondency, and filling him with the hopes and ambitions of his
                  kind. Those tiny, dimpled, helpless hands! how had they lifted up his prostrate
                  manhood in that bitter time!</p>
               <p>Here it was, years later, that his heart announced its second passion. That
                  constant heart which, while overflowing with tenderness toward the gentler sex,
                  had so long cherished the memory of a dead love. Here, began that war of noble,
                  devoted, self-sacrificing love, over the baser elements of feverish passion, which
                  had so quietly and steadily waged in his great heart through the later period of
                  his life; and here he came to gather strength for the last sacrifice.</p>
               <p>The place was consecrated to her, also, for here, her beautiful maidenhood had
                  ripened to richest bloom. Here lie the books which were late her companions and
                  teachers. There, the work-basket, filled with little keepsakes, and implements of
                  feminine industry. He looked over its contents with a feeling of tender reverence.
                  The taper thimble seemed part of the slender finger it fitted. The box of tapes,
                  with its French painting of flowers upon the lid—; its neatly arranged, untangled
                  contents, told him of that taste, which associated with elegance, and beauty, the
                  humblest concerns of life; of the neatness, harmony, and order that waited upon
                  her footsteps.</p>
               <p>She was going to leave him; and all these, her possessions, would be gone also. He
                  looked around the adorned chamber, in his mind's eye shutting out all that
                  pertained to her. It looked so barren, so bare, so desolate, that his heart
                  chilled.</p>
               <p>Again, his thoughts grew retrospective, and he saw in that survey of the past,
                  that his life had not been vain. All that he had proposed to himself had been
                  achieved. By patient effort he had won from nature such revelations, as lifted the
                  burdens from many a bowed back, and thus, he had been a benefactor of his
                  kind.</p>
               <p>He had won reputation. Not the ephemeral fame which fills the public eye and ear,
                  and perishes with its generation; but that larger renown which one age pronounces
                  to another, and which echoes to distant times.</p>
               <p>Dearer than all this, he had filled one young life with happiness. He had drawn
                  around his beloved an invisible circle, over which sorrow had never passed. From
                  out this circle, and from his protection, she was about to step, and <emph>his
                     work was done.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>The teeming future had suddenly grown blank—aimless. Life worthless, and
                  inexpressibly burdensome.</p>
               <p>To the brain, which had late been busy with grand schemes, the heart which had
                  pulsed with high resolves, there had come a great pause!</p>
               <p>Hopes, aims, aspirations which had filled the citadel of life with the music of
                  prophetic voices, were stricken mute. Reason, investigation, thought—the
                  intellectual athlete—were palsied. Over all the nameless attributes of man, which,
                  from the cradle to the grave, are busy with their appointed travail, there had
                  fallen a mighty <emph>hush</emph>—like that which reigned in the enchanted city,
                  where all, from the prince on his throne to the artisan at labour, were turned to
                  stone.</p>
               <pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC5981-00000168"/>
               <p>Then, amid the silence and desolation, the last hope lifted up her voice, and
                  discoursed of <emph>death!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Death, the deliverer of overtasked and wearied men! The peace-angel, who gathereth
                  clamouring cares into eternal silence, and droppeth healing from his wings.</p>
               <p>Would not this stern benefactor come speedily, and lift from his drooping
                  shoulders the burden of an aimless, loveless, hopeless life?</p>
               <p>Why, now that the affluence of existence had been spent, should he endure its
                  poverty? Why should the cup which palled, be drained to its last dregs? Did not
                  his own hand hold the spells which death obeyed?</p>
               <p>Oh, night of baleful extremity! Oh, false, insidious sophistry! Instinct of right,
                  up, and prevail!</p>
               <p>The intellectual athlete breaking from their thrall, wrestled with the temptation
                  and subdued it.</p>
               <p>God hath not taken you into his counsel, or told you wherefore ye were made,
                  wherefore ye suffer. The great ends appointed you, shall ye not do them, though
                  they be but burden and travail? If earthly happiness be no part of the plan of
                  your creation, shall ye forfeit the eternity of hope in rank rebellion? And if
                  life be intolerable, how say you <emph>die,</emph> to that which God hath bidden
                     <emph>live for ever?</emph>
               </p>
               <p>The hand which made all space, and the multitudinous worlds which gem it, from the
                  centre to the illimitable verge, created you, oh, man! In the transient sunbeam of
                  time, mote-like you float; yet when that sunbeam shall be darkened, and heaven and
                  earth shall have passed away, and the worlds of primal creation shall have
                  crumbled to original chaos, ye will remain. Against a principle of life thus
                  indestructible, dare you lift your hand?</p>
               <p>Shatter to dust the casket in which it is enshrined; and, ushered unbidden into
                  peopled space, it shall flit from sphere to sphere, for ever, filling eternity
                  with the greatness of its complaint.</p>
               <p>Like a vision of the night, that hour of temptation and conflict passed, and the
                  morning clothed Walsingham with endurance.</p>

               <p>NOW, during these eventful times, the irascible Captain's temper had grown
                  exceeding gentle. His stout hand, by the sick-bed, acquired a nurse's cunning; his
                  mood was tamed to a woman's patience. Dividing his time between Cola and Howard,
                  who was also ill, he meekly obeyed the whims of each, oblivious of his usual
                  expletives. Quite cut down, was the Captain, by the suffering of his young
                  friends!</p>
               <p>The advent of the "second Richmond upon the field" occasioned the Captain's
                  gentler virtues a few convulsive throes, but he contented himself with glowering
                  fearfully upon that interloper when he crossed his path, which, to do him justice,
                  he did not often do. Not that he avoided the redoubtable sea-hero, or was in the
                  least disturbed by his expressive glances. To tell the truth, his own regards were
                  so steadfastly fixed upon the clouds of heaven, the mountain mists, or some other
                  prospect, equally distant and intangible, that the interesting play of feature,
                  with which the Captain favoured him, was as altogether wasted as are pearls before
                  swine.</p>
               <p>But when Captain Walsingham fully understood, and believed, that Viola was about
                  to withdraw from his brother's protection, and accept the guardianship of a
                  stranger, then—then—then what an outburst was there! Captain Walsingham, in his
                  wrath, modelled himself after a storm at sea. Being familiar with elemental
                  strife, he imitated its fury with complete success. It is unnecessary that I
                  should describe it; nay, impossible! When the tumult died away, in low
                  undergrowls, Viola was like one stranded.</p>
               <p>"To think," muttered the Captain, like retiring thunder, "to think of the
                  ingratitude of the child! the utter heartlessness! the cruelty, one might
                  say!"</p>
               <p>"Don't say it, uncle Captain!" she pleaded.</p>
               <p>"Just like her sex!" he continued. "No more affection than a tabby cat. Pretty,
                  smooth, domestic animals are they all, purring at your hearth one day, and at your
                  enemy's the next; and rending, wantonly, the hand raised to caress! S-s-cat! get
                  out of my sight, child! They say you're handsome, do they? Handsome is that
                  handsome does; and, to me, you are not pleasant to look upon!"</p>
               <pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC5981-00000170"/>
               <p>"Do not—do not!" she said, deprecatingly. "Mr. Walsingham was not thus harsh."</p>
               <p>"Arthur? no! I'll swear, he was not! He'd cut his heart out, and lay it at your
                  feet, if you bade him! His whole life has been a sacrifice to you and yours; and
                  now you coolly desert him as did your mother before you!"</p>
               <p>"What is that?" said Viola, quickly. "What had my mother to do with Mr.
                  Walsingham?"</p>
               <p>"None of your business!" responded the Captain, promptly, as with a great bite, he
                  thrust his tongue in his cheek.</p>
               <p>The Captain, we are sorry to confess, was not polite.</p>
               <p>Taking advantage of the silence that followed this slip of the tongue, Viola
                  placed herself on the defensive, urging upon the Captain's consideration some of
                  the motives which influenced her.</p>
               <p>"Pshaw!" roared he, in reply. "Don't talk to me about tenderness for the memory of
                  the man that's dead and gone! <emph>He</emph> never showed any for you! And then
                  all this squeamishness and delicacy about this poor anatomy, who, I'll be bound,
                  has no more of the feelings than the appearance of a man. You thought
                     <emph>he</emph>'d feel badly, did you? It never occurred to you that Arthur
                  Walsingham's great heart would be rent; or old Uncle Captain be left joyless; or
                  the Eyrie be desolate as Tadmor in the wilderness! Ugh! ugh! Yet one might have
                  hoped they would be considered first, before this miserable shadow of a man, with
                  a shadow of a claim, who comes <emph>spooking</emph> about like an evil spirit
                  condemned to walk the earth, when better ghosts are in paradise!"</p>
               <p>The Captain paused, quite out of breath, and Viola begged for mercy at his
                  hands.</p>
               <p>"You'll break my heart, if you talk so to me, Uncle Captain! You know I love you,
                  and—and Mr. Walsingham; you know I would gladly die for you, if God permitted; you
                  know I shall never be again as happy as I have been in the dear old Eyrie, where
                  you brought me a little child. Oh, forgive me! pity me! and believe that I am
                  acting for the best."</p>
               <p>"You'll not act for the best, I can tell you," responded the Captain, in a
                  mollified tone, "if you follow that will-o'-the-wisp! A pretty tramp over the
                  waste places of life you'll have; and be landed in quicksands and quagmires at
                     last—<emph>you</emph> that have been carried over the rough paths so tenderly.
                  Well, well! somebody else did it before you, and called on Walsingham in the end,
                  as you will do."</p>
               <p>"Dear Uncle Captain, speak kindly to me! and what is this about my mother?"</p>
               <p>"I sha'n't tell you!"</p>
               <p>"I wonder if Mr. Walsingham will not tell me?"</p>
               <p>"Ask him!" exclaimed the Captain, bitterly. "'Twill comfort him to talk about it,
                  no doubt."</p>
               <p>Pale, sick, and glooomy, Howard Irving had reclined upon his sofa, and listened to
                  this lively discourse. He found it quite inspiriting, no doubt, for he raised his
                  languid head, then his recumbent figure, and lastly approached Viola, to add his
                  earnest remonstrance to the Captain's.</p>
               <pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC5981-00000171"/>
               <p>"Indeed, Viola, you are wrong! You have not a friend who sustains you, in the step
                  you propose taking."</p>
               <p>She noticed him no more than she would have noticed the buzzing of a humming
                  bee.</p>
               <p>"It would be headstrong and unbecoming, for a young and inexperienced girl, to
                  take such an important step, unsustained by the judgment of older persons."</p>
               <p>She looked at him uneasily, as though the bee was buzzing too near, and might
                  presently sting.</p>
               <p>"Viola," he continued, lowering his voice, "for <emph>my</emph> sake, stay!"</p>
               <p>The colour mounted to her face, and she bit her lips. The sting had come.</p>
               <p>"And why for <emph>your</emph> sake, if not for <emph>his?</emph>" she said aloud.
                  "I owe <emph>you</emph> nothing!"</p>
               <p>"Nothing!" he exclaimed, reproachfully. He thought of all the love he had given
                  her. Was that nothing?</p>
               <p>She thought of it too, perhaps, for she said, kindly and frankly, "Forgive me,
                  Howard, for I know not what I say, being sore beset."</p>
               <p>"Let her alone!" said the Captain, and gathering up his hat and stick, he shook
                  the dust off his feet and departed.</p>
               <p>I am sorry to record that Captain Walsingham, usually open as the day, was here,
                  guilty of duplicity. At this moment it occurred to him that he was <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">de trop.</foreign> That, in his absence, his young auxiliary
                  might present for her consideration, such arguments as are most potent with the
                  female heart, and therefore he retired—<emph>thinking,</emph> "Here's a chance for
                  you, my boy!"—<emph>saying,</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"Let her alone!"</p>
               <p>Let us extol the Captain's shrewdness, if not his sincerity; for, as Viola, with a
                  word of excuse, was following him, Howard exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"Stay, stay, Viola! I have so much to say to you."</p>
               <p>As though the trials she was now enduring were not enough!</p>
               <p>She put up her hands, the cowardly creature, and cried,</p>
               <p>"Oh, Howard, <emph>don't!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Dont?" he echoed, sharply. "Of what are you afraid?"</p>
               <p>She was again offended by his impatience (we had almost written impertinence), as
                  before, by his assumption; and, with recovered dignity, assured him that she was
                  afraid of nought, but was constrained to bid him "good-morning."</p>
               <p>"No," said he, placing his back against the door, "not till you hear me." And, in
                  his own vehement way, he told her how he had loved her. How she had been the angel
                  of his boyhood—the star of his youth—the <emph>all,</emph> which his heart coveted
                  in life; and wooed her to stay with them—to be his wife—the joy of his heart—the
                  comfort of all who loved her. Growing warmer and wilder, he prayed her to pour the
                  gentle influence of her love upon his turbulent nature—to lay her pure white hand
                  upon the mane of passion, and control its raging. He conjured her, by all those
                  years in which his heart had offered tribute—by the blent morning of their
                  lives—by the memories they held in common, to stand between him and the swift
                  destruction which yawned for him, should he lose<pb n="342-343"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000172"/> her—to save him from frenzy—from despair—to save
                  him from his fearful self!</p>
               <p>She had turned to listen, like one at bay, resenting the constraint which detained
                  her. But, as the torrent of words foamed forth, she trembled, melted, and wept.
                  She, who loved so well, could feel for him, although there was small resemblance
                  between the humble, enduring, patient love which filled her bosom with a sweet
                  content—which asked nought, and was sufficient unto itself; and the imperious,
                  exacting passion which exalted itself, and clamoured for recompense.</p>
               <p>In what did this man's love differ from Walsingham's? There was a sympathy between
                  their strong natures, although one was deep and earnest; the other, vehement and
                  wild. The one sought only to minister to her happiness and good; the other, to his
                  passion.</p>
               <p>With one she was the <emph>end;</emph> with the other, the means.</p>
               <p>In the one heart, love offered up its continual prayer, "<emph>guard her—guide
                     her—bless her!</emph>" In the other, it clamoured, "<emph>give her to
                     me!</emph>"</p>
               <p>The last is the type of its kind.</p>
               <p>"These are the voices that have moaned and muttered within my bosom like summer
                  thunder! These are the thoughts that, like electric flame, have blinded my vision,
                  and consumed my peace! They have broken into language at last, and bespeak your
                  soul's responsive echoes! They have flashed their quick contagion upon your heart!
                  Your tears reveal it! Weep on—weep on! those drops are to me a dew of
                  benediction."</p>
               <p>"They witness that love is omnipotent!"</p>
               <p>"No—no—no!" she cried, "dear Howard, I do—I do not love you!"</p>
               <p>"Why then do you call me dear?" he cried, exultant. "See now, how your own words
                  betray you! How your own tears testify against you! Yet you would hide away your
                  heart, and coquette, and trifle, until all is lost."</p>
               <p>Audacious lover! But for the pity which your love inspires, and which it mistakes
                  for a responsive feeling; but for the kindly friendship which all her life had
                  cherished, you might now receive a rude enlightenment.</p>
               <p>"Do not misunderstand me," she implored. "You have moved me strangely, and I weep.
                  The affection which I feel, and acknowledge for you, is not what you demand. I am
                  sincere—I am earnest—I am above the coquettish arts of which you accuse me. I beg
                  you to subdue these unhappy feelings, and pass on to better things."</p>
               <p>He sank upon his sofa, hiding his face in his folded arms.</p>
               <p>"In the future, when this storm shall have lulled and died away, and this hour be
                  remembered as an uneasy dream; when the great pursuits of active manhood shall
                  engross your energies, and a calmer, happier love beguile your heart, then, as a
                  sister, I would be remembered, for, as a sister, I have loved you."</p>
               <p>The departing rustle of her garments mingled with these accents and he was
                  alone.</p>

                  THAT INCLINES TO HIM A HAIR'S-BREADTH.</head>
               <p>COLA, although making rapid strides toward health, would not be, for some time,
                  strong enough to travel. Viola, too, needed a few weeks of preparation for the
                  change of home upon which she had determined; and, for the present, the
                  man-phantom disappeared.</p>
               <p>While Cola grew strong and well, Howard, who had not been dangerously ill, still
                  suffered from languor and dejection. His constitution, naturally recuperative,
                  failed to recover from the shock of that fearful night.</p>
               <p>Happiness and an untroubled conscience are powerful restoratives, but this young
                  man possessed them not. A mind at ease is the best tonic. His was a prey to
                  disappointment, and remorse.</p>
               <p>He had laboured to save the life of Conway. He had rejoiced in the rescue. He saw
                  him removed from his path as a rival, and placed by his side in the bond of a
                  double brotherhood hood, as the betrothed of his sister, and the brother of his
                  beloved, yet he no longer loved him.</p>
               <p>He could not forgive him the guilt, the misery, the mental abasement of which he
                  was the innocent cause. He could not forgive him the knowledge which he must
                  possess—which he alone could possess—of the fell passion of that night. He was
                  impatient of the feeling of humiliation, and restraint, which possessed him in the
                  presence of this injured friend. The world seemed too small to contain him, and
                  the man who knew his sinful secret, and so he came to entertain a regret that he
                  had not died.</p>
               <p>Although he had not quenched a human life, conscience accused him of the guilt of
                  homicide, and he bore within him the brand of Cain. Tales of horror and
                  traditionary murders grew replete with interest. The inception of hate, the
                  insidious progress of temptation, the allurements and incitements leading with
                  terrible certainty to crime—all the sad history of human progress in depravity
                  absorbed his thought. Not with the just condemnation of offended virtue, did he
                  thus dwell upon acts of moral turpitude. An unwholesome sympathy with the
                  criminal, usurped the place of generous indignation in his mind, and he became the
                  apologist for crime. The fallacious sophistries with which misguided men sustain
                  their courage to some bitter end, or palliate and justify enormities at which
                  virtue weeps, entangled his mind in their treacherous maze.</p>
               <p>In such a baleful atmosphere of thought, his moral character deteriorated; his
                  judgment of right became impaired, and<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC5981-00000174"/>
                  the society of the good and pure ceased to charm him. Their attributes seemed to
                  reproach—their sentiments to condemn him. The truisms of virtue, on the lips of
                  her children, like pointed personalities, were resented, combated, argued against
                  with the bitterness of self-justification, until the sensitive sophist, by slow
                  degrees, convinced himself that wrong was right, and demolished the preservative
                  land-marks between good and evil, once carefully established in his mind.</p>
               <p>Twin-born with this sudden indulgence for the criminal, was a harshness of
                  judgment, toward those who for virtue were eminent. Their deeds were regarded with
                  jealous scrutiny; their motives ungraciously impugned, and their frailties probed
                  to the quick. Thus tearing down the exalted, and elevating the debased, he played
                  the part of a moral leveller, ignorant, the while, how much his own character
                  deteriorated.</p>
               <p>With the proneness of such natures to suspicion and injustice, he persuaded
                  himself that Cola still stood between him and his love. That Cola hated him, for
                  the suffering he had caused, and influenced his sister against his suit. That he
                  had told her the history of that night, and warned her against giving herself to
                  one who yielded as readily as he, to the ruinous impulses of desperation.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile poor Cola, whose open nature furnished him with no key to the operations
                  of Howard's mind, had never for a moment suspected him of hatred or malice. His
                  nocturnal voyage was attributed to accident; and Howard, noble fellow, had, by
                  superhuman exertions, saved him. Hence, with a heart full of gratitude, he amused
                  the hours of convalescence by weaving the brightest visions of romance, in which
                  he uniformly gave his sister to Howard, as the reward of many virtues, receiving
                  Helen in return, as the crown of his own. Then, with parental benedictions, and
                  the approbation of the world, they trod o'er thornless roses, and were for ever
                  happy, etc., etc., etc.</p>
               <p>The current of the story bears us on. It does not fall within its scope to show,
                  by what influences the morbid mind became healed, the wild passions tamed. The
                  inevitable necessities of Fate subdue the most rebellious; Time, and circumstance,
                  are mighty to chasten. Through suffering, his heart became purged—healed. The
                  mirage was lifted from his path, and the old land-marks again guided his
                  pilgrimage.</p>

               <p>INEXPRESSIBLY sweet, beyond anything Viola had yet experienced of Eyrie life, were
                  the weeks of reprieve. Walsingham devoted all his hours to her. There was so much
                  to be said to this tenderly-sheltered child, who was going forth of her own will,
                  a wanderer in the wide world. She, and Cola were so young, and inexperienced, and
                  their protector so unfitted for the care of such as she! Thinking of the
                  quicksands of life, he sought to inspire her with a more worldly and practical
                  wisdom than had before seemed needful. She listened to his descriptions of life in
                  crowds; of characters such as throng the world's highway; of attributes developed
                  by the wrestle of busy life, as some fair novice in her cell, hears the story of
                  distant battles.</p>
               <p>With her foot upon the threshold of the world, this practical knowledge charmed
                  her more than his lore. His discourse was a proverbial philosophy. Every sentence
                  was held by memory as a spell against some future ill.</p>
               <p>She had feared he might condemn her resolution, as the Captain had done; and
                  perhaps in his heart accuse her of ingratitude. That he would never use to her a
                  word so harsh, she knew. His manner soothed that apprehension. Very sad was it, as
                  of one pre-occupied by sorrow; reserved, but tender. The sadness she longed to
                  comfort. To the tenderness her own gushed responsive, but the reserve defined the
                  position he desired her to occupy, and she meekly accepted it.</p>
               <p>Slowly, surely, steadily, inexorably, day after day faded. Step by step the hour
                  of farewell advanced. Cola was now quite well, and but few days remained. One
                  night, feeling too much excited for sleep, she sat by her casement, watching the
                  light in the window of the turret study. Often, when Walsingham's work was in
                  progress, she had watched that light far into the night, with a patient, distant
                  sympathy such as love, offers knowledge. Wondering, the while, what great thoughts
                  were in travail, and believing they would one day shine upon the world, as did
                  that solitary ray in her heart.</p>
               <p>Then she remembered how, when the morning came, he would read to her the product
                  of nocturnal labour, and listen to her comments with respectful interest, as if
                  they were<pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC5981-00000176"/> worthy the attention of one
                  as great as he. But he did not seem great, then, as the world had since proclaimed
                  him, else she would not have dared to offer so freely, her girlish thoughts.</p>
               <p>He crossed the apartment to a case of books; took one, and seated himself by the
                  light. She could see he was reading.</p>
               <p>How she had always loved to hear him read! It was his custom to read aloud when
                  alone; not with any effort of elocutionary art, but with a low murmur, like that
                  of wind among pines, or distant waterfalls.</p>
               <p>It was long since she had heard him. She might never hear him more!</p>
               <p>Nay, she must, she would hear him once again—<emph>now!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Seizing a shawl, she hastily left her room, descended the stairs, unfastened the
                  outer door, and stood beneath the stars. Very quietly she crossed the yard. Very
                  quietly she ascended the study steps, seating herself upon the topmost one.</p>
               <p>Yes, he <emph>was</emph> reading. Through the door came the well-remembered music,
                  in broken snatches; now low and mournful—now lost—now rising higher and higher,
                  like the wail of an æolian harp.</p>
               <p>From earliest childhood she had loved this music. It came to her now, like the
                  voice of summers gone. It was an incantation, summoning back the pageant of her
                  early life, silent, yet affluent. One glorious June day, in childish frolic, near
                  his window, that murmur had reached her; scarce noticed then, yet memory had kept
                  the echo; and now, the fallen blossoms of that distant year wafted fresh odours
                  round her; bees drank of their nectar, birds cooed on their branches, and the
                  summer sunshine of a day for ever faded, warmed her soul—in this winter night, so
                  dark and cold!</p>
               <p>Again, in winter, when he was busy with his books by the fireside, and she sat
                  singing to her doll, weaving wild snatches of childish song, how those tones would
                  rise and swell, mingling with her melody like the deep bass of some grand organ!
                  'Twas strange how their voices blended, while their thoughts were far asunder. He,
                  student-like, absorbed in abstruse themes—she, to the insensate image in her arms
                  carolling dreamily such fragments of poetic thought as drop, gem-like, from the
                  lips of imaginative childhood.</p>
               <p>Loud and more loud rolled the murmured music! More broken and fragmentary became
                  the unstrung pearls of thought! The well-built fire danced, leaped, and roared,
                  sending showers of sparklets upward, and filling the genial room with warmth and
                  light.</p>
               <p>'Twas a glorious fire, no doubt, to be so well remembered, but, alas! it had died
                  to ashes years agone, and the night was bitter cold.</p>
               <p>Clear and frosty was it, and the stars were abroad in heaven. The constellations
                  which greeted her when she came forth had set; while she, with her shawl gathered
                  round her, her head against the door—with music in her ear, and visions in her
                  heart, had fallen asleep!—<emph>and the night so bitter cold!</emph>

               <p>THE moon had risen when Walsingham came forth. As he opened the door, something
                  fell heavily at his feet. His heart told him 'twas human. Frozen to death,
                  perhaps, with but that portal, between the poor unfortunate, and warmth, and
                  life.</p>
               <p>He bore it beyond the shadow of the building, and turned the face up to the moon.
                  Rigid and cold, with her long, fair hair floating in the frosty air, and her
                  pallid features in repose, which might be eternal, was Viola!</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Viola's adventure perplexed the minds of her friends. Why she had been abroad that
                  inclement night, and being abroad, why she had not returned, finding how cold it
                  was, instead of stupidly perishing within a moment's walk of her warm chamber, was
                  inexplicable. Good Grey, believed she had walked in her sleep, and Captain Ben
                  adopted a theory of temporary aberration. Walsingham, while rejecting these
                  opinions, could not invent anything more plausible or satisfactory.</p>
               <p>He determined, however, upon obliging the young lady to give an account of
                  herself. So, when they were alone, he asked her:—</p>
               <p>"Viola, will you not explain to me the circumstances that have so puzzled, and
                  distressed us all?"</p>
               <p>She blushed violently, and seemed painfully embarrassed.</p>
               <p>"I will tell you, certainly," she said; "but I am so mortified—so ashamed of my
                  folly, that—"</p>
               <p>She paused. He did not suggest the word she wanted, and so she had to begin
                  again:—</p>
               <p>"The foolish truth is this: I saw you from my window, reading in the study; and
                  thinking I might never hear you again, I ran down to the door to listen."</p>
               <p>"Was I reading aloud?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; you always do, when you think yourself alone."</p>
               <p>"Do I? I did not know it. Well, did you not feel cold?"</p>
               <pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC5981-00000178"/>
               <p>"Yes, a little; but I sat by the door, listening to the murmur from within, and
                  thinking how from a child I had heard your voice thus, and how I should hear it no
                  more. Then all the beautiful, happy time, that is past, rolled before me. While I
                  heard your voice, I felt held back to the old life, and it seemed that when I
                  walked beyond the reach of its accents, all would be over, and a blank, barren
                  future would begin. So, dreading to take the first step, and shrinking from what
                  is to come, I lingered a little longer and a little longer. Oh, excuse me," she
                  exclaimed, suddenly, fearing that her simplicity and candour betrayed too much.
                  "You know the rest."</p>
               <p>"Poor little thing! dear child!" he said, smoothing her hair. "Do you then love me
                  thus? and are <emph>you</emph> unhappy in this parting?"</p>
               <p>She was silent, with her face hidden in her hands.</p>
               <p>A younger, or a vainer man, or one less in love than he, might have interpreted
                  all this. But a great, true, love is very humble; and his mind was possessed by
                  the conviction, that the boy bloom having faded from his face, and time and
                  thought having recorded their triumphs thereon; that being grave and
                  care-encumbered, the heart of youth could no more warm to him. Forgetting, how
                  manhood had ripened within him, and how his soul had grown great all those
                  years!</p>
               <p>So the world's great man, being humble in the presence of this young girl,
                  counting his gifts as nought beside her youth and purity, did not indulge in
                  presumptuous speculation upon the nature of her attachment for him. It was the
                  affection of a warm-hearted child for its protector—nothing more.</p>
               <p>As if girls were in the habit of loving guardians so!</p>
               <p>But as he sat there, smoothing her soft hair, and pondering upon the touching
                  tenderness which had well nigh betrayed her unto death, the old desire to show his
                  heart to her seized him. He longed to show to this gentle, loving child-woman, the
                  temptations and struggles of his inner life, and ask her sympathy and pity. Of all
                  his outer life, she had been cognisant. She had been the confidant of his
                  ambition, of his intellect in its throes, and its triumphs. She had seen him in
                  his strength, and did him reverence. Should he bare his weakness, and ask
                  compassion? The world gave reverence, and it palled; none offered pity, and for
                  this he was athirst.</p>
               <p>And why should he not speak? Formerly he was her guardian; but from the
                  obligations of that office she had released him. Then, he had feared to destroy
                  the repose of her home. Now, she was leaving that home for ever. She should
                  understand him fully before she left him.</p>
               <p>So, with his earnest eloquence, he told her such a story as women seldom hear. Of
                  a love like those wondrous flowers, that, feeding upon air, cover the rocky barren
                  with caressing tendrils and heaven-tinted bloom. So, had it sprung up without
                  root. So, had it dressed desolation with beauty. Hope withered beside it;
                  selfishness found no sustenance; while the flower that asked no earthly aliment,
                  bloomed on.</p>
               <p>He had told her this, ere she went hence, he said, that, in the future, when love
                  shining in her heart should quicken its sympathies, she might better understand
                  all that she had been to him. That, when the world offered its homage, and her<pb
                     n="356-357" xml:id="VAC5981-00000179"/> ear became familiar with the
                  beseechings of passion, she would remember with wonder, and compassion, the story
                  of a worship distant and reverential; a love ministering long in silence.</p>
               <p>Unlike that imperious love against which she had rebelled, was the touching
                  hopelessness of this.</p>
               <p>While those mournful accents charmed the air, closer, closer to his side she
                  nestled like a bewildered bird.</p>
               <p>Suddenly he threw her from him, and leapt to his feet.</p>
               <p>"Stand back, oh beautiful temptation!" he cried, with energy. "I will not for ever
                  subjugate my nature. I have saved you from myself, but, by the might of manhood
                  within me! I cannot bear your childish caress! These are a lover's arms, I warn
                  you!" and he threw them abroad with wild emphasis.</p>
               <p>She sprang to his bosom and hid her face; and those strong arms closed upon her,
                  holding her close and long!</p>

               <head type="sub">CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>WHEN the man-phantom, as the irreverent old Captain persisted in stigmatizing
                  Viola's uncle—when the man-phantom came, to escort his niece and her convalescent
                  brother to his home, Walsingham (oblivious of his former claims, and intent only
                  upon pressing more recent ones) approached him as a suitor, and demanded his niece
                  in marriage.</p>
               <p>The Spiritualist looked out toward the sunset in silence, and seemed to be more
                  absorbed in deciphering the painted puzzles of the western sky, than in giving
                  audience to Walsingham. Perhaps, pictured in those tender tints, he saw a marriage
                  made in Heaven; for, nodding slowly to the clouds, he pronounced, in his hollow
                  inner voice, "So be it! so be it!"</p>
               <p>And so it was. After a brief visit to the home of her uncle and brother (during
                  which the interest of the former, in sublunary<pb n="358-359"
                     xml:id="VAC5981-00000180"/> lunary things, became wonderfully revived), Viola
                  returned to the Eyrie, its mistress.</p>
               <p>Here her nature continued to expand and grow, to mate the moral and intellectual
                  greatness of Walsingham; and here, in her womanly weakness, she kept strong the
                  hope and faith of the heart that loved her.</p>
               <p>Sorrows reached her, but a manhood, whose attributes were tried, shared them with
                  her. Her path lay sometimes in shadow, but a firm hand grasped her trembling one,
                  and strong arms lifted her to light.</p>
               <p>The next event of importance which transpired, was the death of Judge Conway,
                  whose health had been for some time declining. The union of Cola and Helen was
                  postponed for a few years, until he should achieve a place among men. In his
                  efforts toward this, Mr. Irving and Walsingham extended helping hands; and, in the
                  mean time, having youth, love, and hope, the pair were as happy as birds in
                  spring.</p>
               <p>It will surprise our friends, no doubt, to learn that, before their marriage,
                  Howard brought a bride to the valley of the mountain river. A nut-brown maid,
                  whose swarth and glowing beauty, sometimes grew a shade darker to her husband's
                  thought, when, amid June's roses, he recalled the waving of white garments, and
                  the glistening of golden tresses in the light of a midsummer moon.</p>
               <p>This matrimonial venture was thought premature, as the young husband was not
                  qualified to provide his wife with bread. But Howard was ever impatient of slow
                  results. Mr. and Mrs. Irving invited the newly married pair to make their home
                  with them, where the devoted bride incontinently addressed herself to the worship
                  of all who were connected with that superb fellow and god-like creature, her
                  husband. In the goodness of her heart she was in danger of contracting an intimacy
                  with the beautiful mistress of the Eyrie, who seemed particularly kind and
                  attentive; but the "<emph>god-like</emph>" intimated his disapproval, and she
                  desisted, like a dutiful woman as she was!</p>
               <p>The Captain spent much time in training dovelets in the eagle's nest. His views of
                  women, and consequently of matrimony, became greatly modified, and, I am told, he
                  did seriously incline thereto. But, by unfortunate chance, never meeting with a
                  lady who was young enough, and good enough, and pretty enough, who would have him,
                  the old tar sailed to the end of his voyage without a mate.</p>
               <p>We have a husband for the faithful Mrs. Grey though, and at this moment, and on
                  this spot, we offer the apology we owe him. Excuse us, Midas Mitten, that,
                  absorbed in the sentimentalities of lovers, we have forgotten to chronicle how
                  sharply you have been looking after the main chance. How you have bought lands,
                  and cut down forests, and torn out rocks, and built mills, and laid roads, and, by
                  various devastating devices, improved the valley, and enriched yourself.</p>
               <p>And how, becoming enamoured of that large and fertile island which Grey lately
                  inherited from a distant kinsman, you begged the confiding dame to bestow upon
                  you, herself, and<pb n="360" xml:id="VAC5981-00000181"/> her possession; and how,
                  Jim Crow having just then yielded up his breath, she promoted you to the post of
                  patient listener, confidential friend, and prime pet, and addressed herself ever
                  after to comforting and coddling you, for which you were duly grateful.</p>
