CHAPTER I. THE ATTACHMENT FOR DEBT. DID it never strike you, reader, that some persons are chained by the Fates to an irrevocable destiny And setting aside, also, the indisputable theory of man's superiority to other animals, did you never think too, that, separated from his reason. he has also his instincts? We grant you some fall as naturally into the beaten path of human duty as though they were machines, but these are anomalies. Man has reason to guide him in all that is useful and beneficial to society-in all that is grand or sublime in science or art; but his instincts are continually leading him to error-he never, natur- ally, does anything right, from childhood to old age. In the simple act of winding a ball of twine, how sure is the child to wind it the wrong way? and who ever saw a schoolboy hold his first pen properly? They tell us-we suppose the philosophers-that "there is a right and a wrong way to do everything;" but who ever thought of doing anything correctly at first? Is not this a " fixed fact?"-perhaps nature herself is wrong. To be sure men are possessed of reason, but instinct is the most natural.; And pray tell us where would you draw the line betwixt the reason of the Esquimaux or Pa- tagonian and the instinct of the beaver? The difference in men's mental qualifications depends more upon physical formation than we are apt to sup- pose, and, in our present social condition, we are more ready to execrate great criminals than to feel sympathy for them. Depend upon it, crime is a dis- ease-it is certainly the result of physical defects in the brain; and this sometimes leads us to believe that the death penalty is wrong, and that all a community requires is. the safety of its members. Perpetual confinement is better than the rope. But let us, if possible, avoid the abstruse, and come down to unpoetical detail. As barren of important events as was the year 1756, still, to the good city of New York belonged at least two or three worthy of note. True, its popu- lation at that period numbered but about ten thousand; yet, among this small community, there were found persons of sufficient courage and public /  &#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC7034-00000003"/> 4          REBELS   AND  TORIES. spirit to establish a line of stages between that city and Philadelphia, the dis- tance being performed in the unprecedented short time of three days, bearing in mind, of course, that steam had not unfolded its marvelous powers, and that lightning remained in the clouds, where it was supposed to belong. Another event of some importance to the city, was the establishing of a line of packets thence to Falmouth. There is no doubt but the inhabitants breathed freer after this advance to high estate, for wonders had been accom- plished for that year-particularly for 1756-when nothing was supposed to have occurred to interrupt the repose of all elements. But as important as were these events, they were eclipsed by another of apparent minor impor- tance, but of no less consequence to the cause of humanity-the birth of a son in the family of an honest mechanic by the name of Upton. Some fathers might be perfect stoics on the reception of such fortune, but John Upton, as he held the little fellow in his arms, conceived that his heart had ample cause of rejoicing, and he acknowledged him with the first kiss of a father's affec- tion; but his joy was for ever crushed, when, a few moments after, he was informed by the physician that the mother was fast sinking into the shadows of death. Hastily placing the infant in the arms of the nurse, he rushed to the bedside of his beloved wife, and, kneeling, he clasped her icy hand, implor- ing her to live for himself and for their child, with as much fervency as though his mere words, and her own will, could set aside the terrible destiny of the "King of Terrors." The poor woman had not sufficient strength to utter words in reply, orto encourage him in i hope that they would meet again in "another and bqtter world." She could only turn her dying eyes fondly upon him; and, as he) felt the slight pressure of her tiny, pale hand, her spirit passed away, while Upton sank insensible upon the bed beside the inanimate body of his wife. It is a melancholy sight to see the proud spirit of man bend beneath the crushing load of human misery and affliction-writhing in agony under the torture of disappointed hopes and the severed bonds of affection. The reed bends to the blast while the strong oak breaks. As poor Upton lay wailing the loss of his wife, even in that moment of sacred affliction the shadow of an evil presence fell upon the floor of the apart- ment. An hungry dun crossed the threshold, and the awful presence of the dead was desecrated by that base god, Mammon. Such visitors are uncere- monious, and he who now stood before Upton proved himself an adept in consummate impudence and heartlessness. His presence had been unnoticed by the object of his visit, but, not to be backward in claiming a recognition, he laid his hand heavily upon the almost unconscious mourner, muttering, as he did so, his name. Upton started to his feet, and stood before him with a wild and threatening aspect, which at first, in a measure, alarmed his visitor; but the latter soon recovered his indifferent composure, and with a snle that might challenge the patience of an angel: he introduced the object of his visit, Your name is Upton, sir; you will excuse my visit. I know it is a little unpleasant, but business must be attended to, you know, and if I neglect mine I must starve. I sympathize with you-really you deserve pity. I suppose   REBELS AND    TORIES.           5 you do feel bad, but it can't be helped, you know; we must all die sooner or later, and poor Mrs. U. has only gone a little before us." This speech was accompanied by numberless awkward gestures, though the speaker seemed to encounter difficulty, in raising his eyes to meet the angry and scornful glance of Upton, and, as if he detected menace in it, hl gave a hasty look behind him, and stepped backward, as he continued- "I was not much acquainted with Mrs. U1. myself, but I have heard her very well spoken of. I dare say you feel her loss, but, as I said before, it can't he helped." What an expression of rage gleamed for an instant upon the features of Upton! but whatever his emotions were at that moment, he succeeded in controlling them, and folding his arms across his chest he merely exclaimed, "Well, sir!" "No, it can't be helped, and so-but you must excuse me-I thought of asking you to settle this little bill." And he held up before the eyes of Upton a dirty scroll of paper, but which answered very well the purpose of the holder. "Sir!" exclaimed Upton, with a rigid expression of feature, I commend your delicacy; but I must beg of you to choose a more proper and convenient occasion to remind me of such obligations-at least you can wait three or four days." "Not if I can help it. You see I have waited a long time, and I would like a settlement before proceeding to extremities. The law allows lthe creditor great privileges, but I only %want what is fair and proper." "But, sir, your visit is inopportune in several respects, but most especially on account of my affliction." "I am impartial to persons or places, Mr. Upton, and your afflictions are not going to pay my bill. I must have it." "The refinement of your torture is exquisite. But let me caution you not to proceed to extremities. Call upon me again when you can do so with more decency. And now, sir, will you leave me?" "Hem! I don't see how this will pay me. You can give me some satisfac- tion, if you choose."' What kept Upton from crushing the reptile? He sprang upon him with the ferocity of a tiger; but instantly releasing him, he sank upon a chair, and covering his face with his hands, he burst into tears, as he exclaimed, "Not in your presence, dear Ellen. God help me to pass through this trial!" Two or three of Upton's friends, who now came in, compelled the intruder to  leave the house, but not before he had threatened revenge for the assault upon his person. With his absence, however, he was soon forgotten, and quietness was restored to the house of mourning. The occurrences of the next two days are not of sufficient interest to transcribe, but on the third day came the funeral, and mourners and friends assembled to pay the last tribute of re- spect to the departed; and as the small procession filed through the principal streets toward the burial-ground, scarcely a passer-by but showed some sen- timent of regret for the deceased, or sympathy for the mourner.  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7034-00000004"/> }          REBELS AND TORIES. The company had reached the grave, and the bier was p aced upon the ground between the mourners, in order to give those who c Ises a last op- portunity of beholding the beloved features of the dead. The lid was removed from the face, and one by one they came to take their final leIe, and last of all, the husband; and as he gazed with tearful eyes upon the vreck of all he once held so dear, sobbing forth his heart-broken farewells, his ears were startled by a familiar voice, that exclaimed, as a rude hand waylaid upon the coffin: . - -.    - "I attach this corpse for a debt of twenty pounds due me by John Upton. Ralph Tristam, do your duty!" The bystanders started back in horror, while a groan of ag ny was the only recognition paid by Upton to the words of his avaricious creditor. "Is that the law?" asked a thoughtful, elderly gentleman. "I never heard of such in this land,"' replied one who stood next the ques- tioner. "But this is no time for dispute or :argument. John is unhappy enough already. Leffers is a beast, and if he' chooses to bring here some of the usages of his own country, impute it to his ignorance; and although law and public opinion may not sustain him, let us, his friends, rather than this imposition be carried farther, settle this business for John, for -he sake of peace, and for the holy memory we have for the dead." And thus was it arranged; and in proof that human nature is not entirely corrupt, a compromise was soon effected, by which certain paxt'es pledged themselves for the payment of the debt, and the burial ceremony was allowed to proceed without further interruption. APTER t            i CHAPTER II. ' THE PRO1MSE TO PAY, AND THE DEPARTURE FROM H.1IE. JOHN UPTON became I an altered man by the tleath of his wife. As he stood beside the grave that contained all that endeared him to earth, brooding over the cruel incident that had been so happily terminated, his heart changed from the early softness of its nature to the stubborn coldness of despair ; and l he turned toward his desolate home with the feelings of one whose existence ' for the future could never be cheered with one solitary ray of hope. Entering his cheerless apartment, he threw himself into a chair, and remained for hours absorbed in a deep agony of thought. His child was brought to him, in the hope to change the current of his feelings; but, without deigning to look upon it, he motioned it away with an expression of repugnance. The spring of affection that had at first welled up at the sight of his first-born, had called back its waters to the sealed fountain that no thought or circumstance could ever again open. It is easy to imagine the full measure of the affection with which he might have regarded his child; but bg a singular method of reason- ing, abstruse and far-fetched, that at times will possess the human mind, he attributed to it the loss of one whom worlds could not replace. The next day following the funeral, after sitting many hours alone in his   REBELS   AND  TORIES.           7 solitary room, absorbed in a wandering maze of blusy thought, lie arose and approached a small escritoir that stood -in one corner of the apartlment, and which had formerly belonged to his father, and taking from" thence a book of memorandums, with a bold and massive hand he made the following entry: "'Decenmber 16, 1756.--I promise to pay Nahlm Lefters twenty pounds, with SUITABLE INTERE ST, at my earliest convenience. God spare me till then.                        *JOHN UPTON." Returning the book carefully to its plae, lie peLed the door of the room, and called his sister, who soon appeared, bearibg in her arms the innocent cause of so much unhappiness.   Motioning her to a seat beside himself, he proceeded in a tremulous voice to inform her that the care of rearing the child must devolve either upon herself or the city-that to him it was not material which course was pursuled, as he was devoid of :any particle of affection to guide him in his wishes. lie advised her not to assume the task hlerself; lie wished no tie of relationship to affect her in making her choice.        t ' For,' said he, "he will grow up forgetful, and Nwill never thank you for  your trouble. For myself. T shall leave this city to-morrow morning, ere tle earliest eye in it is unsealed.  Whither I shall go I know 'not, but you may never look upon my face again; I shall at least forsake the haunts of the white man.  As long as there are boundless forests and overspreading skies, God will shelter me; fuirther tlhan this I care not what fate hias in store for me; it cannot at least add to my misery, for my measmle is full to over- flowing, and civilization can invent no more. "Now go from nme, for I would pass the remainderl of this day, anld until I leave the city, alone. -Take the child away-nay, do not let me see its face- no matter what you do with it hereafter. My imagination picturees it to 1ne a hideous little fiend that smiles at my misery; and if I should look tlon it, I might do it an injury-- fear I should, and people might call it a crime; but my head feels very odd, and a small thng might set it agoing like a top, and then they would be obliged to chain me. and that would male e Ilmad in earnest. "Now leave me, Mary-quick, quick! for I cannot talk much longer. Oo! but do not speak, for I must not hear a voice that always sounded so munch like-go! for mercy's sake go and leave me!" The sister, bewildered and frightened, clasped the infant closer to her breast, and prepared to leave the room, for she had nevewr seen her brother look so unnatural and pale ; and he, leaning his elbows upon a table, covered his face with his hands, and wept tears that might have saved him from-mad- ness. He heard his sister's hand upon the latch, and starting, he called to her. "' Stay," said he, "after I am gone, Mary, you may take possession of my house until I claim it from you. You are to be married soon, Mary--God blesg you with a happy and prosperous life!--you need not go dowerless to yoeir husband's arms; but you must comply with one condition, or at least grant me one fa vor in return-this room. where I shall put everything that I  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7034-00000005"/> 8          REBELS   AND  TORIES. consider sacred, must never be opened. I shall leave it locked. You need not assure me, but I implore you, as you venerate the last request of your brother, never to look inside it, nor allow the sacrilege on the part of any other person; and I particularly charge you to see that this injunction is not violated. I shall know if it is, and depend upon it you will never prosper from the hour in which you disobey me. "I have now said all that I hake to say. I will leave you authority, so that at this time to-morrow you can take possession of the premises." "Brother-- " "Speak not-I am immovable, and in no condition for argument or expla- nation, Unless you would add to my misery, bear from my sight, as quickly as possible, that detestable child. 'I could have loved it, but with the know- ledge of the perpetual grief with which it has shrouded my heart, I can but wish it from me. Go, go!"  With a sad and troubled expression the sister gazed into the face of her brother, and left the room. Poor Upton listened to her last footstep, as the ? retreating echoes passed to another part of the house, and, rising from his seat, he fastened the door, and commenced making arrangements for his departure. He opened a large chest of drawers that stood in the room, and which had been his rife's. He overhauled and replaced many articles of her wearing apparel. He next took'up a locket containing a miniature, which, after kiss- ing it several times, he placed in his bosom, near his heart, and sitting down upon a low stool beside the bed on which his wife had breathed her last, lie took from a small ivory box, in which he had placed it for preservation, a coil of glossy black hair, and pressing it to his lips, he moistened it with tears that his intense emotion could not control.  The silence of the room was interrupted by low moanings-half-crazed and imperfect sentences of complaint, mingled-with the name of her who haid been his light and joy, and murmured prayers that heaven might see proper in its goodness to call him from his affliction. Then would he charge his heart with being so tough and obstinate. And he sat upon his low stool, and parted the long glossy locks that he held in his hand, and which he had so often seen falling in flowing ringletsa roumta neck and over shoulderis th'- hfiigit lhave rivaled the brightest. creations of Titian or Angelo. Ite- braided them to- gether, and plated them around his neck,' "as a charm," he said, "that would keep away evil spirits." lie then unlocked thedoor of his room, and wan- dered about the house, collecting everything connect9g with the memory of his wife, and placed them in the room which he had devoted to these sacred memorials. These arrangements consumed the entire day and a portion of the evening, and when he had gathered together all that he thought neces- sary, lie again sat down by the bedside, as completely a broken-hearted being as was ever dreamed of by poet or romancer. At times he would weep in the bitterness of thought, and anon he would murmur aloud his melan- choly complaint. "Oh, God!" he would exclaim, "what have I done to deserve this extreme affliction! Alone. 'lne e! It I could die likewise, I would not complain; but to linger, lingers for years alone, is more than the drooping spirit's share. I   REBEL:  A ND TORIES.            9 would not even run the risk of not meeting yoi. again, sweet spirit, else would I end this miserable existence. But there is no hope! I know, I know I mu doomed, and I must linger and suffer for many long years, forsaken and. heart-broken!' He threw himself upon the floor, but no sleep visited hit burning eyes, anld he tossed restlessly until an hour before the break of -day, when he struck a light, made up a small package from a few things which he had gathered, and taking a mournful and lingering glance around the room, lie securely locked and sealed the door, and went forth into the gloomy churchyard, and kneel- ing upon the grave of his departed wife, he uttered many distracted words of mingled prayer and complaint; then with a heavy heart lie arose, and, after one farewell look of fondness and despair, he turned from the spot where all his affections were buried, and with hurried steps departed from the city of his nativity; and when the citizens began to stir abroad in the morning, no one could tell what had become of John Upton. His sister found the seal upon the prohibited room, and the windows strongly fmtstened. However urgent her woman's curiosity might have been, she hadl/oo much reverence for her brother's sorrow to violate the solemnity of his conditions. On the identical miorning of Upton's departure, and ere the earliest light of day had struggled over the forests of Long Island, an incident occurred on the outskirts of the city that bred a good deal of gossip among the quiet inha- bitants, who were not often startled by anything wonderful aside from rumored surprises by the Indians in remote portions of the province-those oft told tales" which only served to lull the settlements into a fancied security, that merely laid them more open to attack in cases of real emerg- ency. On that identical morning-so the story was told by Leffers himself- as he was proceeding leisurely up the Bowery road, toward the residence of a wealthy Dutch farmer, for the purpose of purchasing a horse, he was over- taken by a strong man who bore a bundle, and who, upon seeing him, ap- proached, and laying violent hands upon him, swore, if he uttered a cry, to dash his brains out against a tree.; and then proceeded to tell him that he owed him a round fair debt of twenty pounds, and if he would trust him, as he was an honest man, he would pay him with interest on the 16th of De- cember, twenty-two years hence. And then the str e being laughed-so said Leffers-and looking him straight in the face till his maniac eyes gliswned, he. said he should like nothing better than to strangle him. Then uttering a shout that made the surrounding forests ring, the wild man gave him such a push that he fell into a dirty puddle by the road side, and ran off singing as he went- "I am merry and mad-I am merry and mad, And the Moon, oh, the Moon is my lover; When she smiles, when she smiles, I no longer am sad- Is there maiden or mistress above her?" "When," said Leffers, "he suddenly wheeled, and came trotting back again, ere I got cleverly oat of my puddle, glad to get ofl so. Iie gave me a smart blow on the back that came near knocking the breath out of me. 'I have been thinking,' said he, 'about the interest, and if I let it all stand for twenty-  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7034-00000006"/> 10          REBELS  AND TORIES. two years, it will break me to 'pay it; so I will c'en come at odd times as I am able, and pay you good round interest. You will like that better; and besides, you need take no heed of dying in the mean timepfor you are made over to me. and can't die till 1 say the word.' And away he went again, singing- "'I eat where the owl hoots, '- Ha! ha! ha! And drink with the water newts, Ha! ha! ha! When I sleep I am rocked on the waters blue, And my bed is made in my birch canoe. a ha! ha ha  ! h ha! h! h'" Leffers declared that, when he heard the madman sing the chorus to his wild chaunt, he was running toward the city as fast as his legs could carry him, having forgotten all about the errand that brought him out from his own domicile so early in the morning. It is to be supposed that Lefiers had some suspicions concerning the identity of the singular being wlio had accosted him so unceremoniously; but be that as it may, he did not suffer himself to mention any names, and isubsequently, whel questioned on the subject, he manifested a most stubborn unwilling- ness to answer. He seemed to' think after the story was told, that every one possessed the same knowledge as himself, which was in fact the case; for scarcely a person in the city but was pretty well satisfied as to the debtor and creditor. Leffers was, by no means a favorite, and curiosity was excited to know in what manner he was to receive Iis fiust year's interest; and the usually contented citizens were never befobr so guilty of wishing the hasty flight of a year. Nor was their impatience and wonderment at all lessened, when some one, in the course of that day, discovered attached to the side of a public house known to be frequented by Leffers, the following notice in con- spicuous characters:  ; NOTICE. "December 16, 1756.-In twenty-two years from date, I promise to pay Nahum Leffers twenty pounds, WITH INTEREST. God spare me till then! "JOHN UPTON." CHAPTER III. A MODEL OF A MAN? NAHUM LEFFERS was one of those men you find in almost every commu- nity-of no particular benefit to any one, though in his own estimation he was the man of most consequence. His height was about six feet, and like Cassius, he had a "lean and hungry look." that repelled all'with whom he came in contact. he was long-featured, with high cheek bones, and small piercing grey eyes. He had a large mouth with thin bloodless lips, and a re- treatiing chin; while in person :e ws '., orAtd-shouldered and awkward His   REBELS AND    TORIES.          " dress corresponded with' himself, and was made of the meanest and cheapest materials, as though he was without the means of' appearing like those with whom he occasionally associated; yet he was reported to be wealthy. He had been very successful in trading with the Indians, and in return for whis- key and rum of a depreciated quality, he received their furs at the price of a song. Not over refined in his sentiments of honor, especially where they clashed with his interests, he cared but little to what deeds of atrocity the savages might be excited by the intemperate use, of the " fire water" which he supplied them with, provided he saw a chance of making an extra pound or two by the disreputable traffic. He was regular in his periodical incursions to the Indian country to procure furs-sometimes among the Mohawks, and occasionally paying a visit to the Delawares; so that probably he was not a resident-of the city more than one quarter of the time; long enoughl however, to dispose of his peltries, and furnish himself with a fresh supply of' the pre- cious fire-water, and a few trinkets-worthless, but attractive to the poor  Indian. Whenever he arrived among the people with whom he was going to trade, he erected for himself a comfortable lodge, that served the purpose of a storehouse as well as to protect him from the inclemency of the season. In these excursions he generally went unattended, though those who knew him best wondered how he escaped the many perils consequent upon such frequent intercourse with the Indians-particularly as it was known that their respect for him was not the most unbounded. At one time he did feel himself in danger, when trading with some of the Indian allies of the French. Two French officers, who were present, suspected him of being a spy, and un- doubtedly he would have been put to the torture, had it not been for the influence of an old squaw. who testified to his honesty in that respect; and he was acquitted on condition of filrnishing rum enough to give zest and ani- mation to a forthcoming feast. Leffers had not long been a resident in the colonies, having arrived at New York but three years previous. lis "' first appearance" was in the capacity of a tailor, and on his arrival was humble enough; but as impudence and igno- rance go hand in hand, he was not backward in defining his position. Not being much of an , "artist," he found his profits would yield him but a meagre income; and being naturally ambitious, he looked abalt for a new occupa tion, and at length made an attempt in the Indian trade, and his success being fully equal to his anticipations, the quondam tailor became encouraged. He advanced step by step, until he had become quite a nabob in his way, and owing to his money influence, could have things pretty much as he pleased. He grew wise qui'its fast, and he soon found out that his best article of ex- change for the peltrres of the Indians was rulm; for with it he could get them so crazy, that he tmade the' bdains his own way; for sometimei a savage would get so po;esessle for the dreadful poison, that he was ready to sacri- fice a whole seersss hunting for a few gallons of the soul-degrading poison.* * The experience of the present day has proved the uamno thingj' Col.

' At the period of which we write, Leffers was about twenty-five years of - age, though in appearance at least thirtytfive. His family consisted of him- self, and his residence, when in the city, consisted of two small apartments in a house situated in one of the by-streets. Its external features were not such as to tempt the propensities of the robber, had gentlemen of that profession abounded in that era of virtue; and only those who knew its tenant better than comported with a good opinion of him, would have-supposed him worth  a half-penny clear of the world. But with all his failings, he was not guilty of being without " something for a rainy day." Many a hard story had been told about him, but the worst accusation of all was a charge of decoying a young Indian maiden from her tribe, on some specious pretence or other, while on a trading excursion to the Valley of the Mohawk, and selling her into ab- solute slavery for the sum of ten pounds. The maiden had attracted his special attention during one of his fur seasons, and through kind acts and a few presents, he gradually won the affections of the simple child of nature; and;at length her feelings became so ardent, that, during one of his visits for tranfic and plunder, Leffers found little difficulty in persuading her to take sum- mary leave of her kindred and people. The day pri ding the one of his in- tended departure, he succeeded in gaining the cofisen' the maiden that she would secrete herself in the vicinity of the Mohawk, a few miles below the Indian village. The place was well knowni toboth, and marked by a:blasted cedar of uncommon proportions and singular appearanee,' .-     : ; i As soon as the girl disappeared he began to hasten his piearations for ide-, ^C. parture, though not in such a manner as toiexcite suspicion, and by the iio im appointed he had everything ready. It was almost noon when le; iiledhis, boat off into the current of the river, well laden with the fruits of his expedi- tion. The occasion was one of no novelty to the Indians, and he was suffered to leave them with as little ceremony as though it was an occurrence of every houll. Ordinarily he would have reached the trysting-place earlier than was convenient, but, through the invention of one delay and another, he managed to make his arrival opposite the blasted cedar, late in the evening; and the sky being also overcast, and no moon, he felt particularly grateful to his own "stars" for the propitiousness of the hotr.  At a concerted sigl from Leffers, who had stepped ashore, the young creature sprang to meet him, though to heart and ears like hers, scarce a sig- nal was needed. It was but a brief greeting, and Na-she-ma was seated by the side of her lover, and the boat was once more on its way to the waters of  the Iudson. Now they floated down the river, in silence, while upon the shore scarce a sound disturbed the stillness of the scene, save the moaning of the wind through the forests, or over the high impending banks of the stream, or the barking of a fox and its echoes among the surrounding hills. For several minutes, without uttering a word, floated .the twain along by the cur- rent of the Mohawk; and silence, so. often eloquent with lovers, hung around them with a spell that each seemed fearful to break. Of a certainty the heart returns of his winter's hunt; how little he foresees or regards the consequences to him- self, or anybody else, of his indulgence in this fatal poison.":            r r               ;c   -        iRE BELS AND    s 'ES.         13 -'4Tf..poor Indiiat maiden felt so fill of unnl,- -red tend' mness and bliss, that i-he knew not wilrl to -ind th langunage to c\ press the emtotions that thrilled -   her frame; :while the blid spirit of Ileftlrs seemed to sink with the conscious veiglit- of the great wrong he wiws enacting. lilt this stilnl :.s to the maiden was awful, and she wu,: the first to break the silence. Whenl tihe white chief sang in the ears of Na- lit ,n:a." , he uftered lowly and musically, "she found his song sweeter thaln thl voices of spring birds; and like a thirsty doe, panting for the. cooling watl.'; ofl the lake, her ear drank in the warbling fondness of his tonguie till her ow1 lheart went away captive to the stranger, and peace no longer dwelt in the rce chief's wigwalm, and the sight of her own braves pleased no more, and the spirit of her fithers from their low graves under the green-waving grass, came not to counsel her as in the days when her heart was a stranger to the love of the pale face! Now, when her back is turned for ever upon the homes of hei vn people) will not the sweet singer breathe again the song that she loves to hear?" But now, lowever eloquent Lcffers might previously hl;ve been, he felt less inclined to converse than to silence; and he listened to thhe words of the Indian maiden with looks and gestures of impatience which only the surrounding gloom prevented her from perceiving. So far his object was gained, and the principal stimulus to his passion-avarice-being gratified, lhe had no further impulse to fondness; and the chief desire that now troubled him was, that his commodities might be in the market as soon as possible. He felt vexed that she should have spoken at all, as he anticipated the trouble of again going through a scen'e of tenderness with her to reassure her of his affection, though his feelings' were even so indifferent and cold, that th! ordinary pas- sions of animal instinct prompted him to no liberties with the defenceless, though deceived, maiden. Heartless and selfish in the extreme, he had no sense of pity for the miseries of others; and if he ever did a charitable act in his life, it was but to get rid of the annoyance that he had not otherwise the courage to drive from him. Therefore, after the Indian girl had made her plaint, there was silence for a few moments, and no reply from her compan- ion, or aught that indicated that she had been heard; so shb continued, as it were, the burden of what she had been saying: "Will he not tell Na-she-ma of the grand lodges of his own people, and of his brave brothers, and of his pale sisters? for it is good for the red maiden to hear of them, that she may know them as kindred when they come out from their wigwams to welcome her. Will not the white chief speak?" "Na-she-ma is happy-Na-she-ma loves the white chief," said Lcffers, with a smile of scorn, which, but for the darkness of the evening would have startled her. "o Does she think that the white chief has two tongues?" "'No." answered the maiden. "But I love to hear the voice that charmed me tell the tales of the warriors of the white nation, and of the great chiefs and braves, and of the maidens whose cheeks are like the lilies." ' Na-she-ma grows already sorrowful that she has left the lodge of her brother for the pale'face," said Leffers, as he thought of the price alrehdy bargained for her, and which be feared might yet elude his grasp; and so ie must still continue to deceive her till she was safe in the custody of another.  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7034-00000008"/> "         R'EB ELS AND TODIES.  "The red maiden is too happy, like a bird that sings all the day; but when the dark sorrow is on the. white chief, the heart of Na-she-ma grows gloomy, like the waters of the small lake when clouds hide the face of the great light. And when the hunting-grounds and the wigwams of her people are departing from her, they can only be seen again in the smile that plays, like the morn- ing's first glow, upon the face of him whose slave she is." Leffers already began to tire of her; for all the honey of his tongue had been expended to win her, and now that she was in his power. and the neces- ' sity for further dissembling ceased almost to exist, his thoughts wandered to other scenes and speculations of profit, and to the murmurs and plaints of his victim he scarcely gave other heed than to quiet her. She quickly saw and felt this change in his manner, but attributing it to a different cause, she be- came, in her artlessness, tender and solicitous-at times warbling the wild and monotonous notes of an Indian melody, or soothing him with words of endear- ment and courage; till at last overcome by his obstinacy, or repulsed by his indifference, she reposed herself upon some furs and sobbed herself to sleep- probably to live over again her childhood in dreams. This incident occurred in the spring preceding the opening of our story, and immediately after the breaking up of the ice in the rivers. The poor girl was taken to New York, and there she became sensible of the ,perfidy of her lover, :) for she was sold and abandoned, but not degraded. At the time Leffers met with the maniac on the Bowery road, he was mak- ing preparations for his next visit to the Mohawks; and notwithstanding that adventure discomposed his mind in no inconsiderable degree, by the middle of the ensuing month he had reached the point of his destination, and  I had taken possession of the cabin which he had erected the year previous. His reception, however, was cool, and the Indians commenced trading with   ! reluctance. X On the third evening after his arrival, as he was entering his hut, he was  , met at the door by a young warrior-an Onondag-who proved to be a  brother of Na-she-ma's, and who accused him of stealing his sister, and throat- ened that, unless she -was restored to him ere the waning of the present moon, the scalp of the pale face should hang upon the poles of his wigwam. Leffers  : saw by the manner of the young brave that denial or evasion was out of the   : question. He was uncertain what information Wasshemett possessed rela- tive to the fact, but he understood from his eye how earnest was the threat; ? yet, through a kind of indifference to his own fate, or for some reason inexpli- cable, unless through a blind trust in that fortune which so often favors the worst of men in their direst extremities, he deferred from day to day-any ac- tion on the subject, until the grace given him by Wasshemett for the restora- tion of his sister, had nearly expired; and as he had heard nothing more of the demand, nor had even seen Wasshemett, who, he learned had gone on a mission to the iMoawks, he concluded he should be troubled no more on the subject, though he prayed, mentally, at least twenty times in a day, that his red friend might find. himself in the society of his majesty below. He did not prosper, however. He had done a bad deed,' and he was now receiving his reward. The Indians would not trade with him, and he was contemplating a    REBEL    N D ' O RIE ,          15 visit to the Oncidas. or a return to Newt York, when time had rolled round to within a day of its allotted period. He had been anxious to get away on the following day; but in spite of his best efforts, one little delay and another promised to detain him longer; so he made himself as busy as possible-sat up nearly the whole of that night, and by noon the next day he had every- thing in readiness for his departure; this. however, lie concluded to postponre until the following morning, though lie could not reflect upon his situatio: n with the least satisfaction. Nightfill found him in his solitary cabin, seated before a rude table oB which- was spread no meagre fare; for, next to the possession of money, he idolized his dear stomach; and the viands that on most occasions covered his board. would have tempted all epicure of the most refined school, had lie not been fastidious as to style, as his gun .procured him the choicest game of the woodland. These meals were among his favorite moments, and if ever he felt a gleaml of amiability or humanity, it was after having paid his devotions to the noon or evening repast-more particularly the latter, as lihe generally felt satisfied with his day's performances-tlhat he had added something to his " accumulating tund. Leffcrs had concluded his vesper lmeal, and having moved back frolm the table, sat facing an open window that looked out upon an adjoining field or clearing. The sun had set, althou1gh it was not quite time for the stars to peep out. You could have told by his thoughtfill brow and a peculiar ex- pression of countenance, that memory was wandering back to other scenes, perhaps in other lands; and if the heart's mysteries could have been fathomed, some regret for the past might have been discovered among the rubbish that covered it. But Leffcers was hot subject to lengthy fits of this nature, and the changes of thought are so rapid and singullar, that from the past to the present is but the skip of a flash.  He passed his hand slowly across his fore- head, rose and paced the apartment for a minute or two, and again stoppling before the window, exclaimed aloud: "By heavens! this is the night of the new moon, and if W)asshenmett keeps his word, he will be here for his sister. What a fool. But I must put himln off with the story that I am proparing to go for her. But the devlish red skin has been away these two weeks, and at noon he had not returned. Pos- sibly I may get away before his arrival. and when I come baclk a few trifle.  will pacify the creature. They are not human--that is iinpossible; and it would not trouble me much in my sleep if I should shoot one of thenm. As he concluded speaking he approached a door, tilhe latch of which he raised and*went out into the open air. After listening a few moments to the1 sounds of the forest, the barking of dogs. and the distant halloo of the Indian, he took a few turins about the house; but he soon re-entered his solitary apartment, locking and barring the door; then carefully examining the primt- ing of his gun, he placed it in its usual position by the side of his collch, upon. which lihe was soon stretched in a .lumber as sound as thoulgh no thought of guilt ever entered his breast. A  sound slumber, we have said-that is, to outward sense of the true world; but dim shadows came to firm in dreams-of innocent childhood and prattlung  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7034-00000009"/> 1$         REBELS AND    TORIES. boyhood, of a mother and forgotten playmates, and then a shadow, more dis- tinct, yet darker than the rest, of an Indian maiden, with disheveled 'hair and supplicating hands, kneeling before him, while around her stood a band of half-naked savages, brandishing their weapons, and threatening his life. Such is the sleep of the guilty! \ CHAPTER IV. THE STAKE. IT must have been about midnight when rthe sleeper was awakened by a loud and unceremonious knocking at the door; and hastily arising from his bed, and seizing his gun, he demanded the cause of uich untimely intrusion. The gutteral tones of a firm voice replied: "Wasshemett seeks the Young Fawn of his cabin. The pale face has stolen her. Wasshemett mourns for the Young Fawn. Our chiefs ask him if he is no longer a brave, and the women whisper in the lodges of our people. What says the white chief?" The white chief knows nothing of the Young Fawn," replied the tremu- lous voice of Leffers from within., ; He is sorry she has left the lodge of her brother. The white chief mournsbr the maiden, but he knows not what has become of her.' "The white chief lies! Wasshemett will not sleep without his scalp. He is afraid to look at the' grave of his father, for the voice of the Young Fawn is not heard in his wigwam. The feast and the war-dance is ready, and our warriors ask Wasshemett for the sacrifice. He has come for the white chief. Let him sing his death song." Leffers paused a moment for an answer, for he perceived that he was in a dilemma, and 'that Wasshemett was in earnest. Time was important, and some scheme must be devised by which he might be relieved. Wasshemett grew impatient, and again knocking at the door, demanded if the white chief "heard the words of Wasshemett." Leffers held his gun in his hand, and at the sound of the Indian's voice, his eye fell upon the barrel. In an instant it was raised, and stepping a pace or two back from the door, he fired, and the report was followed by a war- whoop so fierce and terrible that the blood forsook its natural channels, and his knees grew so weak that he had to cling to a chair for support. Ere he could recover himself, the door was burst open and the room was filled with half a score of dusky figures, led by Wasshemett, each of whom was hungry for the blood of a victim. The' trembling wretch knew too well the nature of the Indian to plead in that eventful moment of excitement; so, suffering him- self to be dragged along amid their glittering scalp-knives and uplifted toma- hawks, he passed over, the threshold of his dwelling into the open air, while a powerful savage, hideous in his war-paint, threw a flaming brand into the apartment, which had soon been in a blaze, but for the prudence and fore-   REBELS AND    TORIES.          17 thought of Wasshemlett, who, rushing in, hurled it far into the clearing-an act of caution to prevent a neighboring encaumpment of white traders from be-  ing alarmed by the flames, and coming to the rescue of their prisoner. "Is Jaconnet a fool!" exclaimed Wasshemett, as he emerged from the cabin. "that he would make a big light for the pale faccs to see our trail? They have many cars-let the tongues of our warriors rest.." After tying the hands of lefl'rs, he was placed in their midst, with two of their fiercest-looking warriors as guards-one on either side-and they took up their line of nmarch. After they had passed about two miles down the river, they crossed over, when an altercation arose among then respecting the manner in which they should dispose of their prisoner. It w:as finally con- cluded that he should he taken to one of their villages, about live miles dis- tant, and accordingly they were soon in motion. By this thne it had grown cloudy and dark, so that their progress through the forest was slow and tedi- ous, and it was fill two hours before they arrived at the place of their desti- nation. As they approached, the savages came out with their clubs and tom- ahawks, and struck and abused the prisoner in a most cruel manner. He was stripped naked, and blackened with coal and water-a sign that he must be burnt.  Hie now thought it high time that lie should beg for his life, and he com- menced in most hearty earnestness; but he was only answered by wild yells of derision: while they continued to beat him with clubs and the pipe-ends of their tomahawks. he was then made to run a gauntlet to the council house. about three hundred yards, while men, women and children, and those who had guns, beat him, and fired loads of powder on him as he ran; some put- ting the muzzles of their guns to his body, firing; hallooing, beating their drums, and making the air clamorous with their fiendish shouts of exultation. The unhappy wretch reached the door of the council house, beaten, mangled and bruised in a shocking manner.  In this way the savages celebrated their orgies till near morning, when the prisoner was taken into a lodge of one of the chiefs, his body anointed with bear's grease, and some slight refreshment afforded him. Iis clothes were then given him, and he was made to understand that he might take s9me re- pose. he was then left to himself, with the exception of one of his lynx-yed guards, who threw himself at length on the floor before the door, in such a manner as to prevent the escape of Lcffers without arousing him. and in a few moments he was in an apparently sound sleep. No slumber, however, visited the eyes of Leffers. lie pondered solemnly on his condition, while his back smarted with the severity of his chastisement; but no method of escape struck him-to attempt it even would be folly. He would hate given at least half he was worth in the world to have been well out of his difficulty; but his lot had not fallen among beings so highly civil- ized as to accept of a bribe. What to do, he knew not; and thus the day dawned and passed away-an insufferably long one-without further inter- ruption from the savages, and amid a silence that contrasted strangely with the terrific howlings of the preceding night. Toward evening a party of warriors seized him, put a rope round his neck. 2  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7034-00000010"/> 18          REEIPBELS AND TORIES. tied his hands behind him, stripped him and blacked him as on the night pre- vious. He was then led away to another village, about two miles distant. where preparations were made' to burn him. In this place there was also a council house, part of it with and pirt without a roof, and in the latter portion of which, in the middle of the aria, stood a post, around which were placed, at a distance of fou feet, three piles of wood, about three feet high. To this post he was brought, and with the thong that fastened his arms, he was bound to the pillar of his execution. :A rope was also put around his neck, and tied to the post about four feet abovei his head. The piles of wood were then kindled, and the flames began to ascend, and a horrid death by burning now appeared inevitable; the savages a11 the while dancing about him with wild gesticulations, and filling the air with their fiendish yells. But amid all'the terrors by which he was surrounded, and above the glare of the flames, and distinct from. thelbronzed figure sthat danced in their hellish glee around him, one sight of. horror met his sight that caused him to shiver with supernatural dread. It was the glaring of two fierce eye-balls, that were fixed upon him so intently, that tieir glances seemed to pierce him like dag- gers, while the countenance which they illumined was made more hateful by a smile of such incarnate joy, as caused the faces of the savages to appear an- gelic. It seemed but a momqnrt, but that was sufficient to recognise the features of the maniac Upton. The recognition was accompanied by one wild shout above the general chorus, while the condemned, as he writhed at his stake of torture, saw the madman flourish a huge club in the air, as he cried, "Not yet, Nahum jeffers-not yet.  Ia! ha! You shall live to be paid principal and interest. So laugh with me at the merry show. Isn't it brave torture? But be patient-be patient! Ha! ha! "I am merry and mad-I am merry and mad! And the moon-oh, the moon is my lover, Ha! ha!" And in another instant he was lost amid the crowd of savages. The flames now began to ascend with rapidity, and nothing appeared to the unfortunate captive more certain than death. At this crisis occurred what seemed nothing less than a miracle. The sky which to this time had been without a cloud, suddenly became overcast; the wind arose until it blew a hurricane, and in less than three minutes the rain began to fall in terrents, and the fire was instantly extingti1shed.* In about fifteen minutes the rain ceased, the savagei: in the meantime, viewing the scene with awe and amazement. It was looked upon by some as an interposition of the Great Spirit; while others regarded the unhappy Leffers as a great medicine, to kill whom would bring down upon their heads some awful judgment. * A similar incident occurred to one John Glover, who was taken prisoner by the In- dians in 1782, he having been employed by Colonel Crawford as a guide in his expedition against the Indian'towns on the Sandusky river, an account of which has been previously published by the author. ^          o                     e        -   .   REBELS AND TORIES.             19 Wasshemett. who until this moment had maintained an imperturbable silence, now advanced from the group of warriors, and proposed that the prisoner should be removed to some place of security until the next day. This was opposed by some, but finally agreed upon; and Leffers was coim- mitted to the care of three savages, who conveyed him to a block-house, where his arms were tied until tie cord was hid in the flesh, and a rope put about his neck and fastened to a beam; and in this situation his guards commenced to harass him to prevent his enjoyment of a moment's rest. Toward mid- night, however, his tormentors laid down and were soon asleep, andt the un- happy prisoner was left to the companionship of his own thoughts. It was near morning when Leffers was aroused from a drowsy revery by the entrance into the block-house of Wasshemett. The savages who lay stretched upon the floor, started up as he entered, but he took no further no- tice of them than to point toward the entrance, making a significant gesture that they might retire. 'After they had gone, he stood- facing his prisoner, with folded arms, and with so fierce an expression, that the latter suspected Wasshemett of an intention of completing his destruction in a private way; but he was soon relieved from this fear by the voice of the young brave. "The white chief shall keep his scalp, for the Young Fawn has found the wigwam of her brother. Let him look." Nahum raised his eyes, and at the same instant encountered the presence of Upton, who had entered the block-house unperceived, and who stood facing the captive, holding by the hand Na-she-ma, the sister of Wasshemett. The face of the maniac was pale and haggard, but the glare of his fierce black eyes, as he fixed them upon the captive, gave to his features an expression that impressed the latte with feelings of indefinable dread. Pointing to the maiden, who stodd gazing with undisguised affection upon the noble form of her brother, he almost shouted: "Oh, ho! Master Nahum! So here needs no introduction, for by your looks you are already acquainted. You must dive deep or fly high when I do not meet you. There is an owl sits in the highest bough of the old pine tree-he watches you o'nights, and he hoots merrily-Hark! The black fly -not so big as an owl-he follows you the weary day; these are slaves of mine. They meet me every night in the church yard, when the ghosts walk, and make me their reports. Ia! Now you are thinking of gold! Let us be gone, maiden ; there is danger for us. It is a bad sign for a miser to think of gold. Let us be gone." And turning round with the pomp of a king, he led Na-shc-ma out through the door by which they had made their entrance. During this scene LetTfrs did not once raise his eyes from the floor, except at the alpearance of Upton. As soon as they were left together, Wasshemett :g'Jin addressed his prisoner: "Life is too good for the pale face; but Wasshemett is no longer thir ty for his blood. Our braves -call for him-they are angry that the sacrifice is so long delayed. The Young Fawn is returned-her heart is soft-I ,iave promised your life if your foot is swift. Come!" Approaching Leffers the young chief severed with his knife the cord:: that  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7034-00000011"/> 'U)         REBELS   AND TORIES. bound him, and motioning him to follow, he led the way out into the open air. Morning had by this time so fiar advanced, that objects were plainly dis- cernible; and as they approached a level piece of ground that extended in front of the lodges that composed the village, Leffers perceived that nearly all the inhabitants were present, formed on the plain in two parallel lines, armed with blows, clubs, and various implements, and a few with muskets. He was now given to understand that, in consideration of Na-she-nla's restoration, it hlad becn decidedi that lie should have a chance for his life by running the gauntlet. - The distance fixed upon was about three hundred yards, at the end of which a painted post was set in the ground, which, if lie reached, his life was to be secure, and he at liberty to find his way home. So much lamed and bruised was he by the previous day's treatment, that his hopes of escape were faint; but still, as this was to be his only chance-and lie knew the de- cision to be inevitable--he determined to task nature to the utmost of her endurance, and if he failed, why there was an end of him. He was brought upl to the starting-point with as much ceremony ts more civilized nations bring forth a race horse, and scarcely allowing him five minutes to arrange his thoughts, the word was given, and off he started amid a chorus of yells from young and old of both sexes. At the same time he was assailed by missiles of all kinds, including stones and dirt, and crowding in on his rear as he passed along, he was bruised and beaten in a terrible manner, eachl savage seeming to vie with the other, in the infliction of the torture.

A LITTLE HS'TORY AND ANOTHER MODEL OP A BOY. T'wo years preceding the events related in the foregoing chapters, there broke out one of the most desperate and sanguinary wars ever known on this continent, originating in that watchful jealousy which has so long subsisted between the English and French. This war, known as the ' French and In- dian War," arose from disputes respecting boundaries ; the English claimed, by virtue of the discoveries of the Cabots, the entire coast firom Newfoundland to Florida, and which they had extended .by numerous grants, westward to the Pacific Ocean. The French, however, founded their claims on actual occu- pation and exploration; and, independent of their settlements il Canada and Acadia, they lhad for several years occupied Detroit, and explormd the Mis- i ti = .   * -   REBELS    AND TORIES.           21 sissippi valley, forming settlements upon it, and along the northern border of the Gulf of Mexico.  They also claimed in their northern possessions nearly half of New York, and the largest portion of New England; and to protect these claims, they began to erect a chain of forts, from Nova Scotia to tlhe Gulf, by the way of the Great Lakes and the Mississippi.  About the same time the crown gave a grant of land on the Ohio river to a compalny of mler- chants. and the French were suspicious that the design of this company was to deprive them of a portion of their trade with the western Indians; and while the company were surveying their lands, they were attacked by an am- buscade of French and Indians, and three of their party seized as prisoners. From this period, the differences began tolimultiply, lntil at length (Governor Dinwiddie found it incumblent on him to remonstrate. A person was em- ployed to convey a letter to the French cammandant,   . I)ce. St. P'irre. This messenger was GEOrRGn I WASHlINGTrON, then in his twenty-second year. Washington  found the comnmandfant at a fort oil French Creekl a stream that empties into the Alleghany in the coullnty of Venatngo. This was in thie fall of 175:'.

From this, hostilities may be said to have ariscn, tlough no overt act of any imrlpor- tance took place till early in the ensuing yea:r. Each opponent now seelnmed anxious to secure the Indian-il  as a llies, and tlhe French in particular eoretied a powerfll influence to disallect the Six Nltiollsn who had for so nlIllV years been the stauncdt allies of thie English; blit through the watchfiulness oft' Sir William Johnson. for whoml tl,( c(onlfe,4racy had great respect, and in wliose abilities theS replosd the uthnost conlfidelnce, the exertions of the Frenchl emissaries were flruitless.

Such at least wasnthe case fifty years precviously, in thc, eastcrn states. The jealousy existingDetween the English and French imparted itself to the In- dians, who in all disputes sided with the latter. When ti!e savage was asked the reason of this prejudice, lie replied: "The Frencllmen speak and a ct on our behalf.

You put the flaming cup to our lips; filled our veins with poison; it wasted the pride of our strength, and when the fit was on us you took advantage-you made gains of us. You made our beaver cheap; then you paid us in watered rum and trifles. Have Christian Englishmen lived up to their engagements? Never." This out of the way sketch of events that occurred so fong previous to the principal action of our story, has been made for the purpose of throwing light upon some of the influences that had so long been at work to arouse feelings of hatred in the bosom of the red man toward his white brother. And it must be confessed, by the impartial and candid reader, that a large pro- portion of the atrocities of savage warfare may be laid at the door of the more civilized being. But as full details of our colonial difficulties may be found in the pages of the huge musty volumes of history, that rest, dust-honored, on the shelves of our libraries, we must refer the reader to them, while we adopt the more im- portant task of giving him some insight into the growth and character of one of our heroes. Let us leave the English, French and Indians, to dispute and fight for a few years, while Leffers, escaped from the gauntlet, is getting rich in his traffic and interest, and take a glance at the progress of young Upton. The father of the boy never made his appearance, tlogh it was supposed he was leading a wild life among the savages, who, on account of his madness, venerated him as a great Medicine. The youngster grew rapidly in size and healthy vigor, under the care of his aunt Mary, who was also blessed with res- ponsibilities of her own-the fault of taking to herself a husband. The boy's disposition very early argued a headstrong and revengeful spirit, that needed a curb stronger than a woman's will. There were several very odd and sin- gular traits in' his character, which early developing themselhes, excercied no inconsiderable influence in forming his disposition-that is, they possessed such control over the general character of the child, that, later in life, they be- came predominant passions to the exclusion of other feelings and better senti- ments. His temperament was gloomy and reserved, and when quite young, he often absented himself whole days from home, buried in the obscurity of the forest. The churchyard was also a favorite place of resort to him ; nor was there a grave made for a departed member of the community, that he was , not present at its opening-j and at every funeral he was found among the train that followed the body to its final resting-place. At twelve years of age he had won the title of the"Sexton." Hie possessed a genius for the trade- a passion for the gloomy paraphernalia of a funeral procession. Had hearses then been faslionable, and had there been oine in the place, he would have in- sisted upon riding with the driver on every occasion. As other boys of his age had miniature gardens, so did he have a miniature graveyard, in which were buried beetles, toads, mice, &amp;c., and occasionally a dog or a cat. Neat headstones were placed to each, and the little yard was as particularly fenced in as though it contained the remains of all the great men the world ever   REBELS AND    TORIES.  saw.* He left his aunt's roof clandestinely at the age of thirteen, at the in- stance of a party of traders, and passed the winter amIong the Delawares, re- turning in spring. These savages noticed his singular propensities, and from some reason unexplained, he was alowed to range from lodge to lodge, and mingle in all their strange rites and ceremonies, and consequently he was enabled to be present at mlany a war-dance and feast, and become a gratified and entranced spectator of many a sacrifice of blood. Mingled, however, with all this singularity of character, was a superstitious ,rreadl of the supernatural ; and to thesge feelings may be attributed the in- violability of his father's wishes respecting the sealed room. iHe had often inquired of his aunt why she never entered the mysterious apartment, but without obtaining from her any satisfactory answer to his queries. Overcome at length by his curiosity, he watched one night until he was as- sured that his aunt was asleep, and then, with necessary implements, he pro- ceeded to effect -an entrance, and solve at once the mystery that had for so many years kept its privacy sacred. With a small auger lie commenced bor- ing into the doof for the purpose of removing the lock, and had but partially effected his object, when his cars were assailed by a groan so dismal as almost to curdle the blood in his veins. He listened attentively for a few moments, and not hearing the noise repeated, he began to think that his ears mlust have deceived him, and he again commenced his burglarious operations. This time his cars were again saluted with sounds so unnatural, and with such frightful groans, that he was glad to seize his tools and abandon the attempt; and when on the following morning he was questioned by his aunt respecting his reasons for wishing to violate her injunctions, he promised never to do so again. on any condition; nor could lie ever afterwards pass the door of the room without a shudder, as he remembered the sounds which he had heard issue from it on the occasion of his attempt on its sacredness. Ilis inquisitivc- ness on this subject became extinct, and lie returned contented to his more congenial pursuits. At the age of fifteen he was apprenticed to a carpenter, who united, with his other qualifications, that of making the best and handsomest coffins in the city. Young Upton had learned something of this, and it was a recommenda- tion that at once determined him to learn his trade of " the best coffin-maker in the place." He acquired his trade with a wonderful facility, and became in a short time, the favorite apprentice of his master-not difficult, being the only one also-whom, in two years, he even excelled in that branch of his business which had given him his reputation. It would be useless to follow young Upton through the tedious years of his apprenticeship. lIe acquitted himself to the entire satisfaction of his master, and received on his freedom birth-day a present of a suit of clothes, ten pounds in hard currency, and a chest of tools-a proof of the esteem in which he had been held-one of the most liberal outfits known in the colony at that period of its history. His early habifs, however, had not forsaken him ; he * This is no sketch of the fancy.

His aunt had become a widow, though she still resided in the house that had been left to her by her brother, quite respectably advanced in years; but the seal remained on the door of the forbidden room, not even violated by her own children. That portion of the house, from the singular noises that were heard in it annually, acquired the. reputation of being haunted, and many of the neighbors were ready to swear that on certain nights, every year, about the sanme time, lights were seen to shine through the crevices of the windows. Upton would often pause at the threshold of the room, and wonder what dreadful secrets it contained ; but his curiosity had been overruled by awe ever since the night when he first made the attempt upon its privacy. Per- haps this superstitious dread might have worn away, hlad there been no increase to the food which kept it alive in the annual ghostly visits above /'   related, All the old women and girls in the neighborhood declared that they would not be hired to live in the old domicile, for fifty thousand worlds, and the house thrown into the bargain. These declarations had no effect on the minls of the occupants, for they felt confident that whatever ghost tenanted the house in common with them- selves, it was at least an innocent one,.and certainly had the modesty not to intrude into Aunt's apartment. She, good soul, never spoke of the affair, un-? less questioned by gossips, and then her answers were altogether unsatisfac- tory, and throw no light upon the subject whereby those sage, and of course, intelligent bodies, could come to any conclusion what sort of a ghost it was, whether green, purple, or white. If Mistress Mary had her opinion on the subject, therefore, her reserved manner excluded any information that might be sought; but we are inclined to suspect that she knew more than she had a mind to tell. In its regular visitation for years, the ghost had but once been seen, the circumstances of which .appearance were as follows-the inci- dent being altogether too important to omit in this veritable history. Leffers once declared that, as Ih was passing the house on horseback about the 16th of December, 1773, he saw a light, and heard sounds as of some one weeping; and stopping to listen, he saw issue from one of the windows a frightful figure, dressed in long white robes, with a beard that reached to his breast, at which his horse became scared, and took so suddenly to flight that he was thrown to the ground with great. force, whereby he received such a fearful gash on his head that his life was for some time despaired of. Many doubted the story of the apparition, though his wound was indubitable evi- dence of having been thrown from his horse. A small scrap of paper was also found pinned to one shoulder, on which was written in harsh characters, "The 17th Year's Interest!"So regular, however, were these yearly in- terests to Leffers, in one shape or another, ithat he lived in a perpetual dread, yet too stubborn to be driven from his position; for he believed that the same unrelenting hand could strike him in any retreat to which lie might fly. Whatever might have been his own opinions on his singular destiny, lie never communicated them to any one. The agent of retribution was always invisi-   REBELS AND    'I'ORIES.           S25 ble, and the blow was invariably strulck in solme unexpected way. With these exceptions, hower, lie prospered nmlrvelously . In one of his visits to Boston, he possessed himself of a bouncing bit of a wife, whether in exchalnge for peltries or not, we cannot say; and he was doing his best, in a small way, to raise respectably a small iamily of children, who were ill many respects of their mother's pattern. But he got tired of living in the city--whether ble- cause lie expected to thrive better, or because he hoped, by leaving it, to be relieved from receiving farther payments of the dreaded interest, or because said interest having been so regularly paid for seventeen years in sauch terrible coin, he trembled at the approach of that period when the principal should become due--whether it was for any or all of these causes, it is not within the author's pen to tell; but it is certain that early in the spring of 17 75, he purchased land in the Valley of the Mohawk, .put him up a log house, and removed thither with his fiamily. But did he escape the persecuting spirit lhat haunted him? Far frolm it; for this year he received a more fearful pro'of of the unforgiving -spirit of his relentless debtor than cver. His pet child-his oldest boy-a promising yolith of ten years of agc-was sudldenly :hissing, from his parental roof. The anguish of the parents was unavailing, fruitless their search, unanswered all their inquiries. No wandering foot step betrayed him, no flying rulnor brought tidings of hiim, and for a long time it was supposed that the boy had been stolen by the Indians. Months after- ward, however, as Leffers was leaving his cabin early of a morning, he found, sticking in the crack of his door, a slip of' birch Lark, on which was writenll - The 19th Year's Interest-Paid." He thought of his lost boy and trem- bled; he returnedl to the bedside of his two remaining children, kissed themn and wept. Hie was convinced now that there was no flight fi'om his dreadlfill enemy. In the heart of the city, in the depth of the forest, he was sure to be overtaken. Escape was hopeless-resignation or despair were his only alter- natives. The year following the loss of, his boy, on the night of the 16th of DIcellm- ber, his barn was burnt, and several of his cattle'destroyed. No notice of ' interest paid" accompanied this judgment, but by the date of the 1month, he could not'fail of attributing it to the right source. It was a severe loss, bllit the sight of his children brought relief to his mind; they were spared at lea:st for another year. But Time marched on his course of seasons. The doomled man was not to be forgotten, and the 1Gth of December, 1777, was marked by the loss of his other boy. Words cannot paint his agony. Days, weeks and months he wandered in search of him, among tribes of Indians. alld every setting sun seemed to mock his despair, till his search was abandoned, land lie returned holne heart-broken, but desperate. His poor wife welcollmed hi with tears and smiles, and his little daughtter-his now sole remaining child- sought to climb his knees for a kiss. he had no words for the little thing, but as he took it in his arms, and pressed it to his bosom, lie made a vow to himself to:watch over it and protect it, even at thie hazard of his life. Elo- quent were the appeals of his wife to leave that part of the country where calamity seemed to fall upon him with tenfold force and gloomy his resolu- tion to mcet his destiny where he stood.  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7034-00000014"/> 26          REBELS  AND  TORIES. "The blow," said he, "has fallen so unerringly for twenty-one years past, that we have very little reason to hope that it will miss us the two ensuing years. What my remaining destiny may be, Heaven only knows; but I have forebodings of the twenty-second year, which you will live to see realized. If this child is spared, on you will devolve the responsibility of its education; for, if I mistake not, after that period I shall be beyond the reach of the perse- cuting malice of my invisible foe. Would I could meet him, and. by one de- cisive struggle, terminate the dreadful uncertainty of my fate." Thus he went -heavy-hearted to his fireside, and the beauty of womanly love and faith brought no consolation to his spirit; and from thenceforward no light penetrated the gloom of that mourning household. But to return to young Upton. In a short time after he had completed his apprenticeship, he improved an opportunity that was offered him of establishing a shop of his own, and from his being an excellent and expert workman, he was soon overrun with orders. This was in 1777. In the meantime no tidings had ever been received from the Upton of for- mer days; and many supposed him dead; though reports occasionally came from a western tribe of Indians that a singular being was residing among them, for whom they had a remarkable veneration, on account of his favor with the Great Spirit, by whom he had been particularly distinguished-in other words, he was mad. The savages were in the habit of consulting him before undertaking any hazardous expedition, and on these occasions he invariably accompanied them as their Great Medicine.  Perseverance and a strong pursuit after any desired object, seldom fails to bring about the end sought for-sometimesthrough the assistance of a fatality, but more often in consequence of the breaking down of all obstacles that stand in the way of pursuit. Fatality, ho ever, had. more to do with the exaltation of Upton-for so he considered it-tihan any direct seeking on his own part. All persons are not fortunate enough to have thrust upon them the occupation that most accords with their taste or genius; but events will show that in this particular Upton was more fortunate than most men. ; f :( CHAPTER VI. ALL FOR   LOVE. BUT a few months after Upton had commenced business on his own account, a portion of the city was thrown into commotion by the death of the old sex- ton. It surprised mahy of the quiet inhabitants, for however certainly they considered death to be the common lot of all, no one had dreamed of his ever visiting his old friend the sexton. But so it was, for no condition of man will exempt him from this alternative ;but what was considered still more singu- lar, the old man had prophesied the precise day of his demise (though in his usual good health until within an hour of the fatal moment,) which took place on the 1st June, 1778.   REBELS AND TORIES;             27 Hle had been seen the day previous busily employed in the churchvardl, dig-  ging a grave, and when questioned respecting its tenant by one of the cieti-i s,  who happened at that time to stroll into the yard, the old man pointed downr into it, and answe d with a deep sigh, "I shall lie there myself to-morrow! I have labored, si) in this place for years anl years, at times; and I have placed beneath the sod many of the proudest and loveliest; the most powerful and the weak. I have seen plentiful havests, and have gathered them in while many have wondered why the old sexton should be forgotten. But my time has at last arrived. Last night the messenger warned me to prepare. You, sir, may rail at superstition, and call me a dreamer, but ere to-morrow's sun shall have set, I shall be reposing in the cold bosom of my mother earth. You will not miss me, foryou wtilfind othti t fiShaIt ofce for yoniur self, which you doubtless expected would bW inist by me." The citizen turned away with a kind salutation to theold man, not doubt-  ing but he was demented, though events sulseqw tlyhowed that he had  ordered a coffin from Uptfi, and the ncxt mirniing he was found dead in his- straw pallet, dressed in appropriate garments, and laid out in order forburija and on the afternoon of the saminlayhe-was oIgnedl to his last ph of sleep, followed by a motley train of Inourers, only one of 14hom wept tears of sorrow for his departure-this was an orIbhii-hizt whomheh adopted when she was a mere child, and to whom lie left his entire effects, including the house in which he had resided and one thousand rix dollars. The girl was very beautiful, and at this time about seventeen years of age. ,--, i Ier grief attracted the attention of every one present, on account of its pure sincerity; and though but few had tears to shed for the departure of the sexton, many felt the moisture gather in their eyes on beholding the grief of the fair girl. Upton was there, and touched by her beauty, and her affliction, he ven- tured words of consolation; but she heeded hin not, for it seemed her heart was buried with her only friend; nor did she leave the grave of her benefactor until the last sod was placed upon it, and then turning, she presented her hand to a young man who stood by her side, no uninterested spectator of the ceremony, and they left the churchyard with slow and solemn pace. At- tracted by the loneliness of the young mourner, whose beauty had .already lighted a torch in his bosom, that eventually lIroved a beacon that led hint into many a doubtful maze, Upton followed the young couple into the street, and toward the dwelling of the afflicted damsel; and what convinced him more certainly of the state of his feelings toward the fair orphan, was the fact of his viewing with a jealous eye the attention bestowed upon her by the per- son who conducted her from the mourning scene. What seeds of destiny lie in a single moment. Tle above incident brought to light new traits in the character of Upton, that hitherto no circumstance had occurred to develop-jealousy and hatred. Until that moment, his mind had bieen running in channels that prohibited the possibility of splitting on such rocks. Love and passion had never been given fuel to feed upon; these feelings, or sentiments, had been suffered to  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7034-00000015"/> 28          REBELS AND TORIES. slumber in inactivity until such time as an accident should astonish him with the reality of their existence. What a night must he have passed-the night that succeeded the day on which he first imbibed two such dangerous passions as love and jealousy! No repose, no rest; but an impatient and feverish excitement that made each pulse of his heart throb with strange ardor, and brought uncouth images be- fore his eyes the moment he attempted to close them in search of sleep; ahd when he did sleep, such dreams!-he muttered often in his uneasy slumber strange sentences and vague ideas, and at times he would struggle as one wrestling with a strong man. It is no joke to be in love ordinarily; but when the young god is in the company of that " green-eyed monster," jeal- ousy, there can be no doubt but the victim is as miserable as his most invete- rate foe could wish him. As it is a portion of man's destiny to fall in love, blessed is he that is not jealous.  The next morning, however, Upton was at his shop an hour earlier than his usual time, notwithstanding the feverish restlessness of the preceding night, and for a whole week he labored like one who was working for a wager. le seldom spoke to any one, except when necessary to give directions to his' workmen, preserving to all a gloomy and taciturn disposition. So palpably evident was the change in his character, that every one of his friends spoke of it among themselves, and one or two ventured to speak of it in his presence; but he took no other notice of their observation than by a gloomy smile, re- marking in turn that their discoveries must exist entirely in their own imagi- nations. There was no possibility of penetrating the veil which he had thus drawn around himself, and it was left entirely to time to develop the mystery. The old sexton, as has been before remarked, left a will, bequeathing his entire property to his ward. That important document, however, contained but few iems-the house, and the ground on which it stood, and the thou- sand rix dollars. She consulted with the clergyman who performed the last sad office for her protector about investing the money, and he soon found her 4 an opportunity of placing it where the principal would slowly increase. The good man found a tenant also for the house, presuming, with proper fore- thought, that the young lady could have no use for it herself, and he offered her a home in his own family, with a delicacy that did honor to his lHeart. She had no fear of being a dependant: for the income from the house, together with the interest of the money, would be more than sufficient for her sup- port. The good pastor had no children of his own, aiiid his lady was pleased at the prospect of having for a companion one whom she had long since learned to esteem, notwithstanding the uncertainty of her origin; and though all who knew her considered her as a dependant upon the sexton, whom they never suspected to be worth more than the house he resided in and his daily bread, yet none failed to love the gentle girl for qualifications that might have adorned those of a more certain birth, and far greater pretensions. She became a resi- dent in the family of the clergyman, the hospitality of which soon deprived her of all embarrassment, and allowed her to regard it as a home; and though she mourned sincerely the loss of her original protector and early benefactor, r,4   RE B ELS  A N  TORI ES.          29 time failed not to soften the affliction with the healing balm which he ever bears on his wings. The society, also, in which she was now placed had its effect to tempet:Jier resignation with the mellow atmosphere of religion. Upton had often gazed upon the pretty orphan with the eyes of admiration, but absorbed:solmewhat in those strange fancies that grew so familiar to him, he had never thought to associate with his sentiments the idea of love. But when he saw her stand weeping over the grave of her benefactor, he was more than ever struck with her remarkable beauty, viewed as it was in contrast with the desolateness of her situation, and a desire to adiniister to her lone- liness grew suddnly within him, prompted by a warmer feeling than admi ration, and to which 'until that moment he had lived an utter stranger. The passion that had so long lain dormant, now gradually d(awned like the unfold- ing of morn among the eastern hills, until it became fervid as the sun's heat at midday, and Jiis malignant glance glared evily upon the form of the fair haired and handsome youth who stood by her side. Two fires had been lighted in his bosom, of adverse natures-Love and Hatred. The true character of the man now began to work its way to the surface. When folks had ceased to wonder at the death of the old sexton-taking it for granted that all ages and conditions must pass the barriers of death to the unknown land-they began to look about them for some one competent to succeed hm, till finally the public voice, with unanimous consent, concluded to offer the mantle of office to Upton. With proper solemnity did he listen to their proposition, and lamented the necessity that brought them to him; yet with faint argument he disputed his fitness or inclination for such duties, until assured that, unless lie concurred, they knew not where to look for so proper a person, when he consented with marvelous grace, and hoped that his poor abilities might be competent to the task, and that he might find sufli- cient forbearance in the community to excuse small errors. Thus was he installed Sexton. A month sooner there had been no pinna- cle in his ambition higher than that. The enviable young gentleman who had secured the affections of the or- phan, was the son of a respectable shop-keeper, whose business had enabled the father to procure for the boy as proper an education as the schools of that periol afforded. Hle and Upton had been playfellows as far as the different natures of their pursuits allowed, though as the latter advanced in years he could but perceive within himself a growing repugnance to the society of Ithe shop-keeper's son. The reasons were not exactly satisfactory to his con. science, and often in his lonely rambles in the depths of the forest gloom, did he sit down upon the decaying trunk of a fallen tree, seeking to find in the re- cesses of his own heart, just cause for his ill feeling toward one who on many occasions had sp own himself to possess none but the kindest feelings toward all his fellowsings. Upton T,  strongly determined and firm set in every thought or action which he onceived or wished to execute. No sooner did lie discover the true state is feelings toward the orphan, than lie nursed them in his lonely hou  and brooded over them in his workshop. At night he tossed restlessly u  his bed, vainly wishing for sleep to drown the memory and thought of /  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7034-00000016"/> 30          REBELS  AND TORIES. his absorbing passion. He did not make it a principle of duty to banish such feelings, however hopeless. The Christian's resignation and strife for self- conquest was a virtue he could not understand. The passion was only hateful because as yet invention had suggested no expedient. , At first he believed the attainment of his wishes an impossibility. Destiny had placed a rival where he designed to reign alone supreme. Thus weeks passed away, the affections of the young pair entwining closer and warmer, and the dark demon in the bosom of Upton growing larger and larger, feeding upon his vitals, and con- tinually crying, "More, More!" Does it not seem that there is a fiend that pursues some men, hunting them down with the ferocity of a blood-hound-driving them with swift flight, on- ward into the dark gulf of despair and perdition!-heading them off whenever they show a disposition to seek the right path-till, desperate with madness suicide or murder ends the hot pursuit and the frantic flight! Weeks, we said, passed away, and then the true inborn character of Upton began to develop rapidly. He had nursed passion and thought until they be- came concentrated in one awful conception. He shuddered, as the idea as- sumed to his eye a visible shape, and he struggled and. worked a whole week longer to banish the horrible vision from his brain; but he was doomed by a fiat as inevitable and certain as death, and in despair he gave up to the influ- ence that was working within him, and leaped blindfolded upon his fate, as the frantic steed rushes into the flames whose horror maddens him. Life to him with such torture, were a poor burden. The consequences of the worst of crimes could not produce misery more acute. To obtain the object of his desire-the boon that his heart craved-there was no act known to the crimi- nal calendar that he would not commit. Alas! Upton chose the tree whose fruit was bitter. He leaped into that abyss from which there is no ascent. No doubt but that the first feeling experienced by Upton as he saw Arline leaning upon the arm of his former playmate, Charles Rowley, was envy; and it needs but a small stretch of the imagination to perceive the growth of thisunpleasant child to the mature monsters-Jealousy and Hatred. In ge- nial soils the advance is very rapid, and one may well suppose the heart of Upton was no uncongenial one. It is true that he made some exertions to smother such feelings as much as possible; but not from any conceivedoduty so much as from a desire not to alarm the suspicions of their object. They met occasionally in the course of business, and young Rgwley treated him with his former consideration and esteem. Sometimes, however, in spite of his assumed disguise, Upton would respond with an indifferent coldness that occasionally surprised Charles. One day, not many weeks after the death of the old sexton, Rowley entered the shop of Upton, for the purpose of ordering some work. The latter was more than usually cool and gloomy, which produced an inquiry on the part of Rowley, if he was ill. "; No-yes, yes," was the stammered reply; ; I believe there is something the matter with me, though it may be only the result of my imagination." "You keep too close in your shop of late, which you know is not congenial with your tastes. You don't have recreation enough. A little sport, or a fro-   REBELS AND TORIES.             31 lic occasionally, would do you good. Come, this afternoon I intend to have some sport-a fishing excursion round the bay, and have engaged a boat from old Jans Watrous. There is fine fishing, I am told, off Communipaw. Come with me-it will do you good, and to-morrow you will feel better." "I am in no mood, Rowley, for sport or frolic, and least of all do I care about fishing. I will not go." "And why not, Upton? You are cool to your old playmate. Explain. What is the reason of it?" I have nothiig to explain, Rowley. You are mistaken if you think I am more than usually cool toward you." "It seems so, at any rate," said Rowley. Upton turned from him a moment; his eye lightened, his pulse quickened, and an unpleasant smile curled his lip as he muttered something to himself. Turning suddenly toward Rowley, who was preparing to leave the shop, he addressed him in a tremulous voice  "You are mistaken-you are mistaken, though, Rowley; and to convince you, I will accompany you on your propoId excursion. You must excuse me; perhaps I have treated you coolly-that is, probably you may have seen something in me to make you imagine it. But I must have my conditions, and that is, that you postpone the excursion till to-morrow." "I could go with more convenience to-day ; but for the sake of your com- pany, to-morrow shall it be then. I am glad, however, that you have con- sented, for I should have hated to have gone alone, and there is no one whom I should care to go with except yourself." There was something in this last remark that caused Upton to start; his eye fell to the floor, and the color slightly mounted to his cheek; but collect- ing his presence of mind in a momelnt, he replied: ' Your flattery makes me blush, Rowley ; I am not used to it; besides, I was thinking if I really was the only person whose society would be agreeable." Rowley smiled, and appeared a little confused; but he instantly replied by making an appointment to meet in a coffee house in Broad street, at noon on the ensuing day, which being agreed upon, Rowley took his leave of the car- penter, who resumed his work; but a searching eye could have detected in his countenance the gleaming of something evil ; and the smile that played about his lips had more the expression of a dark and foul thought, than of inward satisfaction or pleasurable emotions. CHAPTER VII. THE sURPnISE. AND now we come to the. heart of our narrative. Not an unimportant year in history was that of '78; and big was it with fate to the principal per- sonages with whom we have to deal. True, we have been knocking about  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7034-00000017"/> 32          REBELS AND TORIES. dates for the last twenty-odd years, as boys play with marbles, but we have /at last come into companionship with one too serious to be treated with im- punity, or put aside without due consideration. The year 1778 deserves to be remembered as that in which the French gov- ernment entered into a treaty of amity, commerce'andt alliance with the Uni- ted States, in the face of a conviction that such an act would produce a rup- ture between it and England. In fact it was acknowledged by M., Girard. a French Secretary of State, to the American Commissioners, that the measure was not adopted on account of the love which his government bore the Uni- ted States, but for its hatred of the British government, whose pride and arro- gance it desired to humble, by being instrumental in aiding in the dismem- Ierment of its empire; and in no way could the blow be struck more effectu- ally than in assisting the United States in its struggle for independence; and this assistance was supposed to be rendered without a desire or an expectation ol compensation. This year, too, the Indians in the neighborhood of the Mo- hawk Valley began to show symptoms of renewed hostility; and it was under- stood that the Mohawks, under their renowned chieftain Brant, or Thayen- daneyga, would be joined by the tribes of the great lakes, together with the Cayugas, Onondagas, and Senecas, stimulated, no doubt, to this union by the active hostility of Sir John. Johnson and his agents or associates. Conse- quently preparations of defence were made by Congress, and fortifications were built in different parts of that section of the country; and so imminent was the peril, that government looked upon every man able to bear arms as being, in a great measure, obliged to assist in its defence. But our worst foes were not the English, nor their savage allies, the Indi- ans. The tories were equally cruel and bloodthirsty, and often added to their other attrocities, the most unpardonable treachery; and not the least active of this class of enemies in the Mohawk Valley, was Nahum Leffers. His mind was incapable of the conception of a liberal feeling, and he believed that being born in England, he was in duty bound to hate the republicanism that prompted the inhabitants of this country, with strong hearts, to resist a tyranny as odious as it was unjust. The loss of his children, marring as it did his domestic happiness, impelled him to drown the thoughts of his afflic- tion by taking part in the contest between the United States and the mother country; and the meanness of his prejudices might be adduced as a reason for his adopting the cause of the oppressor; but if there was a balance wanted to turn the scale of his choice either way, we think it was readily found n the purses of some of the British officers. Such means were occasionally used to insure the fidelity or services of such tools as were needed to perform a class of duties that the honest and high-minded soldier would shrink from. So particularly obnoxious did he make himself, that more than once his life was in danger; and in one instance he escaped by concealing himself in the forest. The occasion was this: A party of tories had banded themselves together for the purpose of harassing or plundering those ,who were known to be obnox- ious to the crown; and these were under the command of Leffers. The per- sons to whom principally they paid their visits were those who had a fair proportion of this world's goods, and from whose houses they had reason to *.   REBELS   AN   TORI ES.           33 expect a remuneration for their trouble. 'In one of their predatory excursions, in the neighborhood of Schoharie, they were intercepted by a party of Onoi- das,* when a skirmish ensued, and the tories were driven into a swamp, where they fought with a tlesperation worthy of the most rnotable ruffians. Foiu' of the party were slain. awl the rest only escapeld a similar fate by the failure of the ammunition of the Indians, who, thus finding the conquest unequal, r- tired; but fearing an ambuscadfe. and not understanding this movement of the Indians, they did not venture from the swamp, in which they were compelled to remain during the night, with not so much as a dry si)ot of ground upon which to rest thr weary lills, and nothing in their knapsacks calculated to atlord the least gratification to the stomach. They were kept fully sensible however, of the comforts of their situation by an occasional war-whoop that sounded froml the outskirts of the forest, reminding thenm that in their aiffc- tions they were not forgotten, and every minute they were expecting the return of the foe. Toward midnight, finding his position destitute of the com- forts necessary for repose, and his legs becoming somewhat mutinous, Leffers contrived to fo)rm a bed for himself from the branches of trees and small twigs; his example was immediately followed by the others, with the exception of two. who agTeed to stand sentry, until relieved by two others at the expiration of an holr. and so on through the night. which now scemed to have a pros-- pect of wearing away without any particular incident of alarm.   About; four o'clock in the morning, however, the persons who were on sentry-one of whom was Leffers-were startled by the cracking of a stick in their imme- diate vicinity, though at the time it was not sufficiently light to discover any object beyond a hundred yards. The gliard were alarmed, and Leffers pro- posed that the rest of the party should at once be aroused, but after listening for a few moments for a repetition of the noise, his companion concluded that they had only been alarmed by the breaking of a twig by some bird that was preparing to leave its roost. This idea was by no means, however, satisfac- tory to Leffers, who remarked: That was the breaking of no twig overhead.

"Who's said anything?" asked Lankey, cowed a little by the bullying of Leffers. "A body may speak, I 'spose, without being taken up so huffy? I only said it warn't an Indian, and it warn't, for sich a noise as that would disgrace the savage, 'specially if he was on the trail of a white man." "You may think as you please; but I shall stir up our friends here and be ready in time." Leffers advanced to one of the sleepers, and shaking him roughly by the shoulders, put his mouth close to his ear to give the alarm, when he heard his comrade laugh, and turning toward him, he saw him pointing in the direction of a huge chestnut-that stood within fifty feet of them, and directing his atten- tion to some object apparently leaning against its trunk. "Call you that critter an Indian?" asked he in a voice of contempt. "Why, that's nothing more than the Wild Medicine-a chap as is gone out of his head, and has been wandering among the savages for years past. They think him a great medicine. and woe to the man, woman, or child that touches a hair of his head. He's got a free passport through every tribe in the wilder- ness; and there's sure to be a pow-wow wherever he goes!" Leffers gazed in the direction indicated, and there sure enough he saw the Wild Medicine, as Lankey called him. But he knew him by a better title than that, and he shuddered as though his presence there boded no good for him. The light of morn had gradually dawned, so that he was enabled to discern the complete figure of a man, dressed in a costume composed of a mixture of savage and civilized ashion, with a flowing, grizzly beard and long uncombed locks, which were surmounted with a slouched hat. There was a gloomy ferocity in his countenance, which, dimly seen by the first light of dawn, absolutely startled Leffers, though so spell-bound by the fascination of fear that for several moments he could not withdraw his eyes. His first im- pulse would have been to raise the musket which he held, and by a careful aim, destroy for ever the cause of his apprehensions and the curse of his ex- istence. But no; like one in a trance, the power of motion seemed to be de- nied him, while conscious of all that was transpiring around him. Thus they stood, stern and immovable as statues, fronting each other; while the eyes of the maniac glared upon him with an expression absolutely ferocious and ter- rible. This singular being was not unarm@. His gray overcoat, reaching only to midleg, was fastened around him with a piece of rope, in whish was stuck a tomahawk and a horse-pistol; while his right hand clasped the barrel of a rifle, upon the muzzle of which he leaned, and his legs and feet were-encased in Indian leggins and moccasins. The scene that was before him, with the two beings gazing so strangely upon one another, was somewhat of a puzzler to Lankey. Hie began to think that Leffers was himself getting crazy, and he made up his mind to under- stand as quickly as possible how matters stood; so he spoke, after supporting an agony of silence for nearly five minutes: "What in the devil are you both grinning so at one another for? If you've got anything agin each other, why don't you spit it out at once, and not stand there poking snouts together like a couple of roosters."   REBELS AND    TORIES.           35' This speech a little nettled Leffers, and brought him to his senses. He once more thought of his children, and a burning desire for revenge took pos- session of his soul. Shrieking the name of his inhuman persecutor, in tones fhat startled upon their feet the who slept, he raised his unerring gun to his shoulder and fired! For an instant, as the smoke of his piece hid the ob- ject of his hatred from his view, a sensation of faintness crept over him. and for joy he thought he should have fallen to the ground; but when the Smoke blew away, he was horror-stricken to behold, one step advanced, his hated enemy, with'his rifle point-blank aimed at his breast. The companions who surrounded Leffers were too much taken by, surprise themselves, to think of interposing betwixt him and what they deemed inevitable death; and he himself felt that, having exhausted his charge, if his death was the object of his foe, it could be accomplished ere he could reload his musket. But it was not death that he trembled at. for he had a foreboding that his time had not yet come. As long as he was capable of suffering a keener misery, he had faith that his own life would be inviolate-that his unrelenting foe would re- serve him for the last victim, as the crowning cap to a vast pyramid of woe! And the maniac did not fire. For a minute, though, the sight of his rifle was deadly, and then he let the breech fall to the ground, as he pointed toward Leffers with a monarch's dignity, and exclaimed : "Not yet. Nahum Leffers-not yet! There shall be many weary days- there shall be many sleepless nights-many hours of pain-many hours of anguish! Not yet, not yet! The earth must be red first; tyranny must gloat a little first. Treason must breed, and honesty go lean. These must be first, Nahum Leffers! Go, rush into the maddening onslaught; betray, murder and plunder; you shall be as invincible as the spirits in the air! Bullets shall not harm you-sabres shall not cut you! Disease and famine shall not destroy you! Live! Live to curse the earth as it shall curse you- curse for curse! Live! that grief may bow you to the dust, and sorrow make  white your hair! Live! that despair may gnaw like a viper into your heart -that your crimes may become living coals of fire in your breast! Live, Nahum Leffers, to curse God and die!  Hark! Ere the next leaves fall- ere the next snows come-almost ere the swallow departs, shall these things be! So revel! for I am a brave prophet, and, and if you find me not so, post me for a villain, and there will be twain! So farewell, and remember me! But we shall meet again-oftener than you wot; for it will be a brave sumn- mer, and such as you and I will be very busy anon. Bide your time with patience. The end will come. Farewell!" And waving his hand, the maniac departed into the bushes singing with a wild sort of a chalnt: "There'll be feasting anon for the vulture and wolf, And so merry-so merry they'll be, That the toart and the song shall go round with a shout, And the red wine shall sparkle so free! Shall sparkle so free, ha! ha! And the red wine Shall sparke so free!'  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7034-00000019"/> 36        EB  SAREBELS AND TORIES. CHAPTER VILI. "MURDER MOST FOUL." THE morning succeeding the interview between Upton and Rowley, broke, with unwonted cheerfulness. The very air seemed inspiring, and the counte- nances of the citizens glowed with unusual satisfaction, and whigs and tories met and chatted as though opinions of government had never divided them. Upton was busy at work in his shop, and busy, too, with thinking, if one could judge from the expression of his features; and the harder he thought, the faster he worked, at times making a great noise with his hammer, as it were to silence the throbbing of his temples. Care-worn, lie looked as though an age had crept over him since yesterday; and his thin lips trembled, except when he compressed them so firmly that they flushed like crimson. The pu- pils of his eyes were unnaturally dilated, the eyes themselves glowed with a peculiar and unpleasant lustre. That man was miserable ; nor the charmer's art, nor leech's skill could administer to the disease! Everything went wrong; nothing was in its place. Tools were lost, shelves fell down, and the stuff for a coffin he had sawed out too short! But he kept on making a noise, forheo feared to stop ; and thus he managed in time to pass away the forenoon. Then he had no appetite for his dinner, or things were not cooked to his taste ; and he left the table, and bethought him of his engagement with Rowley., It was past the hour, so he hurried away as fast as possible. At the coffie house Rowley left word that he would wait with the boat at the foot of the slip. Thither he went as fastas his feet would carry him, and found his companion, whose face seemned full of joy and happiness, and who so cordially welcomed him that he almost hated him for it. Strange, what mon- sters we may become! But he had sufficient courage to grasp the extended hand-to return its pressue,. even, as warmly and as tight as though it were round his throat! Ah! why should such things be? "1 ain here before you," said Rowley, as Upton sprang into the boat, "But no matter; I had nothing else to do." "I had some work to finish which I could not leave," said Upton, lying a little, and he bent over to take an oar, but more for the purpose of hiding the expression of his countenance, which he felt, from its reflection within him, must be far from agreeable. Rowley now changed the conversation to the subject of their afternoon's sport. They pushed off the boat, and rowed toward the Jersey. shorc- thence down in the neighborhood of Communipaw. Here they commenced their sport, but with indifferent success, till, not satisfied with the locality, they concluded to move still further down, where the fish seemed to take to the hook with more freedom, and they were enabled to draw in several very fine bass.  But for the frank spirit and glad heart of Rowiey, their sport would have continued in silence, for Upton grew every moment more gloomy and reserved. He held his line with an impatience th:at interfered materially with his suncess,   REBELS AND TORI ES.             37 the want of which only inclreased his petulancy. Charles sceiledi ill most exuberalt .spirits, and hti usedl all the powers of his pleaLlant unature to rouse Ihis companion from the inoody spell that was on himl. At lenlgth, from the continued ill-nature of Upton, lie began to tire of the sport, for he felt s'ome- thilg of its influence creeping over himself. But Upton, though he took no ,apparent pleafsure in the sport, seemed adverse to returning before .sunset, and by one excuse and anotlher. and by a proposition to try their first ground again, they continued to wear away the afternoon, till the sun withdrew behind the western hills, and dark k-shadows began to stcal over the ficte of the waters. At length, satisfied with their scanty fortune.'Rowley proposed to return. As he sat looking into the depths of the waters beneath him, ab- sorbed in rellections tlhat gave to his countenance an alhnost hideous expres- sion, Upton did not hear the words addressed to him by 11owley, who viewed him for a mnomwnt with an iuquliring look, anl] then observed: ' Why. you have not cau2ght a single fish, while I have at least been lbrtu- nate enough to secure a supplly for us both. Why should 1 be more lucky than you 7"  Ay, that was the cue to speak from! Why should those last words have been spoken? What dreadful prompting was there in them?  What po- tency was in then, that their utterance should have been so talismanic? Did they compose the charm to call up the demon? All, unuttered, the scelne that followed might never have been acted! "Why should I be more lucky than you?" And Upton, starting suddenly from Ilis revery, exclaimed: "Ao , Rowley, that is it! Why should you be more lucky than I?

I have often wanted to do so, but failed in my purpose, My soul is now wrought up to the pitch which I desire and now, Chalrks Rowley, I tell you-"  And he rose upon his feet in the boat.      f t "What?" asked Rowley. a serious expression for the firlt time stealing over his face.                     \ "That I hate you!" shrieked Upton, in a paroxysm of rage, and shaking his clenched fist in the face of Rowley. "Upton!  "Don't mistake me.

Since then you have thwarted me in a thousand ways. You have crossed me in every path  --but one, the grave-yard. And now you stand betwixt me and hope-be. nt e and heaven, for you have already doomed me to hell!" You mistake, Upton. I never sought-." ; I know you never sought my injury; I know you are innocent of intcn- t tion. But for all that you are my evil genius. I would'it had been other- wise; I would you had been my declared enemy." "Why should I have been your enemy?" asked Rowley, bewildered b. this extraordinary excess of passion on the part of Upton. "Because I would have killed you long ago?" And the speaker fixed the glare of his dark eyes upon the face of Rowley, who sat in the bow of the boat, horrified at the terrible expression in the face of lui companion. The sun by this time had been down so long that the shores began to grow dim, and no sound reached the young men, save in the distance, the dip of oars from a boat that was returning from the city to a frigate that lay moored off the Battery. The hour began to grow lonesome to Rowley, and his anx- ious eyes wandered toward the city, where he could see, here and there, lights begin to sparkle, and no wonder if his thoughts wandered to a domestic scene, and a fair and happy face. But Upton continued: "I would have killed you long ago, instead of making your grave in minia- ture, as I have done an hundred times, with headstone and name. You laugh at me for my taste, as you call it; nor did you think when you joked me for having a natural genius for the sexton's art, that you were assisting me to dig your own grave. I have done it an hundred times!" And he affected a laugh so horrible that Rowley was forced to turn aside to escape the fiendish impersonation of his features. Controlling, however, his repugnance, lihe turned again toward him, and addressed him: "Well, Upton; and what is the capstone to this pyramid of your hate?"  "You don't know that, either!" half screamed the carpenter. "But I will tell you: we both love the same girl. Both of us cannot possess her. I have sworn to-" "Your language, Upton, grows insufferable," replied Rowley. growing alarmed, and for the first time feeling doubtful for his safety. "1 will not  condescend to dispute with you on such a subject. Let us return to the city, for it is getting late.  "Never! We cannot botu return, fortyou will-theni again treI n ni way!

He was in the vicinity of a maniac. Upton was certainly crazy; but looking him fully in the face, yet with a quailing eye, he-said:   REBELS  AND  TORIES.           39 "And what will you do? What step will you take? How do you pro- pose to help yourself?" And frightened as he undoubtedly was, this was accompanied with a sneer that failed not to catch theeye of Upton, as he bent toward him. "Thus!" shrieked the infuriated Upton, as he threw himself forward upon the person of Rowley, before the latter had an opportunity to detect the movement. He fell backward out of the boat, his opponent clutching him firmly by the collar of his coat, and purposely falling overboard with him, but in such a manner as to fall uppermost. Being far the strongest and an ex- pert swimmer, he found little difficulty in keeping his victim under the water, until his strength was exhausted, and his struggles grew weaker and less vio- lent, when, releasing his hold, Upton saw him sink to the bottom. He then swam to the boat, and listening for a few moments to assure himself that no one was near, he upset it, and clinging to the keel, began to call loudly for assistance. In a short time he heard voices approaching. and a boat's crow from the frigate came alongside, and took him in. Questioning Upton as to the cause of his misfortune, they began pulling in shore, when, ere they had rowed a dozen yards, a boat, whose oars were manned by a strong arm, shot swiftly athwart their bow, in the mist of the evening, while from it rang out a wild and pealing laugh that startled the echoes on shore. Three times was it repeated, till the air quivered with the fearful ring- ing of that horrid laughter, and the crew of the frigate's boat crouched for very terror, like they had dreaded the bolt of Jove's high armament, or the swoop of the fearful hurricane. And Upton quailed as though judgment al- ready sat upon him, or the avenging eye of Heaven were about to smite him with its lightnings! The men hung for a few moments upon their oars, as though paralyzed, when, in a degree recovering their self-possession, they pulled in toward the Battery, and in perfect silence set Upton ashore, and re- turned in all haste to their ship to tell the fearful tale, with all the embellish- ments that their excited fancies could add to it; and they swore rouidly to the " fact," that they saw the devil shoot by them in a boat that glowed like a furnace of fire, while his mouth spent fumes of brimstone each time as he laughed; and he shook fiery darts at them till they thought he would beset them! No sooner was Upton ashore, than, nearly prostrated with fear, he hastened with all possible dispatch to communicate to his friends a full account of his misfortunes, and of course the loss of Rowley. The testimony of the sailors, who found him clinging to the boat, as well as the condition he was in him- self, gave authority to the tale which he invented of a flaw of wind d an capsize. Tears were wept for the fate of Rowley, and a great deal of commis- seration spent upon Upton. The fatal intelligence soon reached the ears of the elder Rowley and his family. Imagine the tumult-the despair of the father-the agony of the mother; nor could all their precautions keep from the ears of the beautiful orphan the dreadful fate of her lover; though fortu- nately insensibility preserved her for an hour from torturing suspense. Nothing, of course, could be done for the recovery of the body; but three lays afterward, it was found on the northern shore of Staten Island.  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7034-00000021"/> 40          REBELS AND TORIES. Then came the funeral ceremonies. The grave again received its charge, and again the orphan watched the removal from her sight of a beloved form, whose presence never again could gladden her-whose smile never more could cast its light upon her-whose heart never more could beat responsive to the joyous throbbings of her own. But where was Upton'? Hie who performed the duties of sexton was a novice. Upton could not undertake such services for the friend of his youth. His position, he contended, was more appropriately among the mourners. And all this was believed. The change produced in his manner by the work- ' ings of an outraged conscience was attrjIuted to grief, and he sought consola- - tion in the belief that his guilt was shrouded in impenetrable gloon! Miser- able wretch! there was an accuser he could not fly from. It haunted him in his sleep, it followed him through the streets, it was his companion in his shop!-wherever lie looked-whichever way he turned his footsteps, at all hours-on all occasions, a voice cerpetually kept crying in his ears--'L Mur-.., derer!"He strove against it-he battled with it, and yet it was there, un- conquerable, invincible! Self-condemned, self-damned, where could pardon  reach him? When would he cease to hear the last cry of his victim? What 1 Jordan water could wash out 'the deep damnation of his taking off'?" Lost, lost, for ever! No forgiveness could reach him!-Heaven's high courts may blot out the record, but through eternity there can be no escape for the rniur- derer!-no light from the certain retribution of conscience! But Upton slept as well as most men after such a deed-perhaps better. He feared not the public condemnation. lie felt secure in the belief that mortal eye saw not the act, and he had but little faith in the justice of heaven; yet in spite of all the argumentsof his conscience, there was some- thing in the atmosphere he breathed that accused him, though the eyes of men did not. He was not happy, though he exulted; he trembled at times,  5  though he was not afraid. he was a strong man, and in health; and strong and healthyvillains live defyingly of God or fate; it is only when they are about to die that they falter and shriek for. mercy. CHAPTER IX. "E AVING HOME. SOME months prior to the events just related, Mr. Monroe, the clergyman who is now known as the protector of Arline, the ward of the old sexton, received an urgent invitation from the iphabitants of Cherry Valley to settle among them as their minister and spiritua adviser. He was to supply the place of the Rev. Samuel Dunlop, who, being well stricken in years, and full of honor, had given notice of his desire to retire from the regular duties of the pulpit, and only to officiate occasionally, as health or strength would permit. There were dangers attending the mi'ei vhich required time for cfn-    L'EBEL S AND ' OKIES.           41 sideration, before venturing from the comparative security of the city to the absolute dangers of the wilderness; but it would not well comport with the true spirit of Christianity to allow personal considerations, either of inter- est or safety, to weigh in the scale against duty. Neither was Mrs. Monroe of that disposition that wished to bias the views or opinions of the worthy Doctor. The most important question to be settled was that of age, and this was finally put at rest by the canm religious fervor of the worthy pair, and by the conviction that they were but merely instruments in the hand of that Al- mighty Power whose justice and mercy never fail. Mr. Monroe. therefore, communicated the invitation to his congregation, avowed his desire to accept of it, and gave thein notice that at the end of six months lie should retire from the pastoral charge of a flock, over whom, for seventeen years past, he had ex- crcised-le hoped with becoming humility-his ministerial office, and with whom he had so 'long held sweet communion. He exhorted them to an hum- ble fulfilnent of their duties as followers of Him who died for the redemp- tion of man ; and finally, hoped that hc should have the holy joy of meeting them all in that other world " whiee the wicked cease fromn troubling and the weary are at rest." The period of his departure had now arrived, and the day after the death of Rowlcy had been mentioned for the commencement of their journey. Ar- ra'ngements had been made in the family of a respectable merchant for the reception of Arline, and, a portion of her things had already been removed. But the sudden calamity that had befallen her lover, so affected the kind pas- tor; and his spouse, and their sympathy for her distress was so great, that they oncluded to postpone their #eparture for another fortnight, in order that they might give consolation to the solitary mouiner. The situation of the poor girl was painful in the extreme, and they found it necessary to use all their elo- quence of Christian principle, to soothe the afflicted mourner, and adapt her mind to a condition of quiet resignation. The third evening after the fineral the little party were seated together in the small, neatly furnished parlor. Arline was wrapt in a revery of melan- choly thought, the parson had just finilhed a letter, while the good dame was arranging a few small articles of dresq preparatory to their being packed for tie journey. Mr. Monroe having sealed his letter, put aside his writing mate- rials, and taking off his spectacles, gazed long and affectionately upon the fice of the unhappy girl. It seecmed that he could almost divine her thoughts, for his good lady, looking up from her work at the same time, their eyes met, and in the face of each the other could read expressions of the warmest sympathy for their young friend. But Arline was the first to break the silence. Look- ing mournfully into the the flace of Mr. Monr6e, she enquired if it were not possible for her to go with them to their new home, adding: "I shall be miserable here. I have ho relatives to care for me, nor friends. scarcely, to whom I may unfold my heart. You have been very kind to me, and a thousand times I thank you for it." "But my child," said the good minister, "' have you considered?" "Arline!" exclaimed the astonished damne. "I know you will object.'* said Arli:e h'!r eyes g itenimng. s:nll seeking tlhe 1-    -       1 ,x  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7034-00000022"/> 42         REBELS   AND  TORIES. floor.' "But I will be no trouble to you. I should die, if I stayed here; and I don't know as I should regret that either "' "My child," said the clergyman, " pray talk not so. I am afraid it may be sinful-that it may be murmuring against the decrees of heaven." "But have you considered the dangers, Arline?" asked Mrs. Monroe, look- ing over her spectacles. "There will be no more danger for me tharilfor yourselves; and being younger than yourselves, I may sometimes be of service as a companion, or nurse if you are unwell."  "Ah, my dear!" said Mr. Monroe, ' we go on duty, and may not well re- fuseor hesitate, He who has seen proper to call us there can protect us. You are, possibly, tot aware of the danger of residing in that region. You will find a safe asylum in this city, and the family to which you are going, will do all in their power to make you happy." "Happy!" sighed Arline. "Yes. You are young. A proper reliance upon divine mercy, and balm will yet be administered to your wounded spirit. INot that you should for- get-we don't ask you to forget. But memory, like the softness of twilight, will throw a mellowness around your adversity; and as the northern star serves as the beacon of the sea-tossed mariner, will the remembrance of these days point the path to Heaven. "I know you are right. But I am young, as you say, and have not strength yet to buffet all alone with the adversities of the world. In sight of his star the mariner is often wrecked." '; My dear Arline," said Mrs. Monroe, " believe us that we should be very happy to have you with us; and I confess that you have gained a strong hold upon our affection. But the country to which we go is mostly a wilderness; and, consider, that if anything should happen to you, we could never forgive ourselves if we tieglected to represent to you all the difficulties and dangers of a residence there. You must not forget that the war is raging dreadfully now; and though we may be so fortunate as to escape the Indians, we shall not be long in coming in contact with men of our own nation who will not neglect any opportunity to oppress or insult." I think you will be much more contented in the city; and if you get out to Cherry Valley, you might not find it so convenient getting back again. But," continued the worthy man, " if you will go, why I must confess that it would give me infinite delight to have you a member of our small family- a companion for my wife and myself." "All these things have I considered. I have arguedifor and against the idea; and let me assure you that it is not so much of a aim as it is a desire to place myself in a position where I may benefit my fellow beings." All further argument was useless. Arline had gained her point. Prepara- tions wewi commenced immediately for her accompanying the clergyman and his wife to their new abode, and the occupation that these preparations gave her mind, worked wonders in restoring a portion of her general demeanor. She began to think that she had something besides self to live for; and with a firmness that astonished her friends, she was so soon ready for her journey,   tREBLS AND"TOR IE S.           143 that the little party were or their way ftull two days soon':r thlan s ex- pected. The day preceding tLcir deparure was spent mostly in farewells and  leave-takings; and the last person with whom they all shook hands, as they passed the out-skirts of the c ty, was Upton. He inquired their destination, though from report he knew t before, expressed a hope that they would find the journey pleasant and the r unew home agrecable, with several other com- inonplaces; and he ended with saying that he had some thoughts of visiting that part of the country himself; and so bade them farewell, and there were two at least of the party that were glad when lie left them--Arline and the clergyman. The former neve: liked him ; and the latter remarked, as 'Upton departed, that he didn't " like the expression of the young man's eye." lie hoped he was not judging wrongfully-he hoped that a proper Christian spirit might influence him in forming his opinion; but, like an open volume, that every one who likes may read lie thought that Upton betrayed in his counte- nance the passions of a bad man; and then the look that he gave Arline, made the old gentleman shudder to imagine what it expressed. Mrs. Monroe -good soul-was the only ore who felt charitably toward him; and she re- ally ventured am expression of sympathy for him as she saw him turn away; - andgiSe ventured a hope that he might do well in the world, for he seemed a very ' smart young man." CHAPTER X. "HE INTERVIEWS. ON the evening following ;he departure of the clergyman, his wife, and Arline from the city, a man rr ight)have been seen to pass out of Sloat Alley to Princess street. thence through Beaver street, and across Bowling Green to the residence of Sir cenry Clinton, at the door of which he knocked for adnittance. To the question of the servant, whom he was to announce, he gave the name of Juniper. He was not kept waiting more than half a minute before he was admitted to a sr all parlor on)the left hand side of the hall, where he found himself in the presence /an officer who sat writing at a table. O0Ur visitor was motior ed to a sat, where he was compelled to wait in silence the disposition of the ot zxr, while two letters were written, sealed and dispatched by a onfidential, se-ant, one to Sir William Howe and the other to Sir GCa Caton. In the meantime, Juniper had ample time to study the countenanceand manners of hl m to whose presence he had been summoned. Being somewhat of a shrewd dbserver of physiognomies, and perhaps, withal, no very ardent admirer of h iman nature in general-either from distrust formed by sad experience, or the perverseness of his own inclinations-he took some pains to form an opinion of the person before him, by a close study of every line and feature of his face. In the first place, having been sent for and required to present himself almost at a moments notice, he was puzzled to know for what purpose, and this he tried to read in the imperturbable but dignified countenance of the wf'tcer. Perhaps the first emotion of Juniper, fts  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7034-00000023"/> o      F. "         REBELS' AND   TORIES. he entered the room, was ave, or ffear, yet mingled with a show of coolness evidently put on to deceive the other into a belief that, though there might be villains in the world, he was noii&amp;.of them. But in spite of his scrutiny, he was at a loss to gather from his study any information on the required points, and he was at last obliged to think of something that he could understand better than the face before him. He felt certain that, as far as his political principles went, he was all right; for there was no better subject-or more faithful one at least-of the British crown. His support had always been ardent, and more than once he had received absolute praise from the Com- mandant of the city, General, Robinson, from the effective Cunningham, and from Sir Henry Clinton himself. To have been praised by Cunningham was assurance enough of his faithfulness and services. As far as these considera- tions went, tlen, Juniper was safe, but there was sopething in his behavior, in the twinkling of the eye, and the twitching of the muscles of his face, that seemed to say: I wonder if certain' transactions of my life are known? But these silent queries wer not satisfactorily answered. The letters being finished-and dispatched, the pen was thrown aside with an action denoting fatigue, and swallowing a glass of wine, thl officer turid round to Juniper who sat behind him, and eyeing him severely, as thougl scrutinizing his very soul, his only salutation was, "well!"  "I come, your Excellency, to know what demands you may please to have of me." "I am thinking, sir," said the officer, resting his forehead for a moment on his hand. "Have you seen Captain Cunningham to-day?" "I had orders from him this afternoon," said Juniper, breathing more con- fidently.  i "Orders!-for what?" "Four coffins, your- Excellency." "Ah! he's'a good customer, I suppose?"    / Excellent, your Excellency. He's not particular; anything of a box will do ; and the king's gold runs freely." "Very likely." Here was a pause of a moment or two, in which it seemed that an unpleasant thought flitted over the face of the officer, for he bit his lip, and muttered almost inaudibly: "Cold blooded wretch! would we could do without him!"  "But a very faithful. subject, your Excellency," said Juniper, moving in his chair. As he spoke. the officer looked lim sternly in his face with an eye that made him quail, as he said: ": You are not here, sir, to give opinions, b ut to listen!" '; I beg your Excellency's pardon," said Juniper; but his heart gave to his tongue the lie, for he felt that he could have smote him for the rebuke. Such is the malice and rancorous envy of some hearts, that however inso- lent the tongue may be, reproof maddens them; kind acts poison them, and confidence destroys them. Juniper was one of these, and the words of the officer stung him almost to an outhreak of ,:?;inon; but selfishness saved him. C5   R E B l:L AND 'T' RIE s.          45 in this instance as it had done in many an other. Iis eyes met those of Sir Henry Clinton-for it was to the presence of this officer he had been sum- moned-and he felt that he was detected: though he returned the full gaze unabashed and without flinching. You have a great deal of assurance, young man," said Sir Henry. "You will answer mny purpose very well, though I shall not be disposed to trust you with anything that you might use to lmy disadvantage; still, at the same time. you shall be well paid fbr your services. That, I suppose, will satisfy you?' ' You 'onor me. Sir Hlenry." said Juniper, not without a slight sneer. "How can I serve you?" "I think you told me, yesterday, that you intended to visit Cherry Valley? When do you 'iiopose going?" "Next weeLk if possible." You must go sooner. You must depart the day after to-morrow," said Sir Henry. "Now, if you please, your Excelleney," said Juniper, with a smile. "Were you ever there?" asked Sir Henry. "No, your Excellency."  "Then, you don't know the ground-no matter; you must answer. Can you be ready?" "In an hour." Sir Henry paused again, amid opening a portfolio, took from it a letter, and from the drawer of a writing desk, a package--examined the envelopes and superscriptions, to assure himself that all was right, and placing them on the table, he continued his questions: "Did you see Captain Walter N. Butler when he was in New-York?" "Once at the house of General Robertson," said Juniper. "You would know him, were you to see him again?" said Sir Henry. "I am sure I should; for [ took such strong dislike to him that I shall never forget him." "Well, I don't want )you to leave the city till day after to-morrow. COIli to me to-mornizv night at this time, and I will give you tlis letter and pack-  age to deliver into the hands of Captain Butler himself; and to no one else. You will find him somewhere in the neighborhood of the Mohawk, or Cherry Valley. And this you must accomplish at the peril of your life, and you must preserve them at the risk of your life; for their destruction, or posses- sion by the enemy, would involve consequences of more im)portalnce than an army of such men. You shall be paid in proportion. I know that gold is your god. You will have perils to encounter, but these you must surimount; and when I am satisfied that you have performed the talsk as I shall direct, you shall be paid forty gpineas Do you accept? You see I distrust you- I do everybody till I have tried theor and found them true." "I am delighted at the confidence you have in me, Sir Henry. If it is pos- sible, the trust shall be faithfully performed. There is only one enemy I be- lieve I need fear, and that i3 the Indian."  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7034-00000024"/> "         REBELS  AND  TORIES. ' You shall have a free passport among them. You shall be furnished with everything necessary for your safety?" "You cannot guarantee my safety, if I fall into the hands of the Oneidas or Tuscaroras," said Juniper, hoping to prove, by the presence of more dangers, extra hazard.         ' "That risk you must assume yourself; besides, it is no more than you would run ty going on your own affairs, as you first proposed. Enough of this. Now for other business-the reason why you cannot go as soon as I could wish!"          , Rising from his seat, Sir Henry ;rossed the room to an escritol'and tak- ing from it a letter, he handed it-tieuniper, saying as he did so- "This you must take to Cunningham to-night. If you don't find him at his quarters, you must seek for him. You will find him in some of the pot-houses about the city. If by chance he is at home, and abed, you must rouse him." At this instant there was another summons at the door, and a servant an- nounced "General Robertson." As Sir Henry turned to receive his visitor, the general met him with open hanis, and a face expressive of the most be- nevolent humor. He was a man whose age was at least seventy-five, but whose erect and military figure Time had as yet but little affected; his coun- tenance martial in an eminent degree, his eye brilliant with much of its youth- ful fire, his personal appearance still attractive, and his demeanor bland and engaging. Before he had time to speak, Sir Henry had clasped him almost in his arms, and pressing him into a seat, exclaimed: "My dear general! what business of dread import has brought you out in this inclement evening, and so late, too?" "You know, Sir Henry, the weather nor the hour is nothing to an old sol- dier like myself; and I can never sleep upon neglected duty." "Something important, then," said Sir Henry. "Is Washington at the city walls I Are the rebefsthicker than Egypt's locusts, swarming over our heads?" "Neither, Clinton, neither; but the affair is simply this. Not more than ten minutes before I left the house, I received information from a private source, that the notorious William Marrener* with a company of rebels from the Jersey side, meditates another incursion into Long Island, in the neigh- borhood of New Utrecht and Flatush, for the purpose of liberating some of the American officers there on parole, capturing a few of our staunchest loyalists, and committing robberies and other depredations." "These fellows are a great annoyance, general. What can be done with them? Like the heads of the hydra,- here one is lopped off, another more venomous arises. What time does this shoemaker intend to start upon his expedition?" ': I understand that he calculates upon being at his work to-morrow night; * This Marrener was a shoemaker, and had made himself particularly obnoxious to the British by his frequent visits to Long Island, from New Jersey, capturing loyalists, and destroying or carrying off their property. He at one time kent a tavern in New York, and he died in 1814, from the effects of falling from his wagon. \,        -   REBELS AND    TORIES.          47 and I was thinking, Sir Henry, that you could find, quicker than I, a proper person to dispatch to Colonel Axtell, at Flathush, that he might take the - ecessary steps to intercept and capture the entire party, with their notorious eader." j "I can recommend you to none better than our friend Juniper, here, who, you know, is the most expert and faithful messenger we have employed this many a day." Juniper was standing by a chair, near the door, during the above conversa- tion, and had not been noticed by General Robertson; but no sooner had his name been mentioned by Sir Henry, than the general, turning toward him with as much apparent pleasure as he would greet an old companion, ex- claimed. 'Ah! my faithful spy! you are just the person for this duty." When, turning playfully to Sir Henry, he said, "But I forgot to ask you-is there any one dead in your family that you have sent for the sexton and coffin- maker?" "  Oh, no, m1 dear general!" exclaimed Sir Henry; "1 have to thank my stars that my family have of late been afflicted with nothing but the enemy's bullets." "Ah, I am glad of that," said the general; "but I am afraid that that complaint will ere long get so malicious in character1 that it will puzzle our army surgeons to find a cunning cure for it." "May it never come to so serious a pass, general," said Sir Henry with a smile. "With all my heart I hope not," replied General Robertson; "but I only said I 'feared,' that was all, I believe. But to our business-do you know, Sir Henry-making coffins is not the most accomplished of his professions? For entering an enemy's lines, for penetrating his camp, for ascertaining the disposition and strength of his forces, for giving you plans of his defences, and sketches of his movements, commend me to Juniper." "You are flattering me, general," said Juniper, for once really blushing. "You must have had thorough trials of his abilities to award such high praises to him," said Sir Henry Clinton. "ie was found vbry useful two years ago, at the battle of Long Island, where he proved his worth in a dozen ways; and in one instance he was com- plimented and rewarded by Howe, for piloting a detachment of eIcssians, on the evening of the 26th of August, across a morass, by which they were en- abled to cut off and destroy a considerable body of the enemy." "That is certainly one instance of his services that I have never before heard of," said Sir Henry, " though myself present. The reward was well  e merited. particularly being himself an American, from whom the service came with so much grace. and his loyalty, consequently, the more unexpected and grateful." Juniper bowed; but he gave an inquisitive look into the face of Sir Ilenry; for he was in doubt whether or not he should find a sneer upon it. But the look did not satisfy him-the face was calm, cold, impassive. "You must excuse me, Sir Henry," said the general; "his services have  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7034-00000025"/> 48         REBELS AND TORIES. been extraordinary, for so young a man, that I speak of them to everybody; and at the'moment I had forgotten that you knew as much about him as my- ;self or Sir William Howe." "Ay, indeed! and have found as much. ue for him." said Clinton, with a smile. "But touching this business-I am glad that you called upon me, general; for I think that Axtell should receive intelligence of this movement as early as possible; and here is the very person for our need, and the same you no doubt thought of as you left your house to call on me. How op- portune "' "You are a wizzard at guessing, Sir Henry,"' exclaimed the general with a s ile.  "It's an unprofitable art, though, general. Here are materials for writing. If you please you may communicate to Colonel Axtell the amount of your information; for you may tell him some things, perhaps, that could not as well be given verbally by a messenger." "With pleasure, Sir Henry," said the general, moving toward the table. While General Robertson was writing, Sir Henry turned to. Juniper, and bidding him be seated, said: "Now, Juniper, this will not alter our plans. Though this business is im- portant, your journey need not be deferred for an hour. You must set out for Flathush to-night, as soon as you have seen Cunningham. Do you know where Colonel Axtell resides?" "Yes, your Excellency." "Can you depart at once ' "At the moment you name, your Excellency." Very well. Don't hint to Cunningham anything about it. lHe is not al- ways the shrewdest of men. When you receive the general's letter, no time must be lost. You may find some difficulty in getting across the river; but you must turn out a boatman from some of their haunts; and here is money enough for your expenses. Do you understand now what you are to do?" "Perfectly well, your Excellency." By this time General Robertson had finished his note, and placing it in the hands of Clinton, the latter, after reading it, sealed it and gave it to Juniper, together with a guinea, at the same time bidding him about the business with all possible dispatch. A few further verbal instructions were given him by the general, when Sir Henry rang for a servant to show Juniper the door. As he was. leaving the room, Sir Henry said to him, "Remember! you must be here to-morrow evening at nine o'clock." t In a minute more the door was closed upon him, and he was making his way up Broadway as fist as he could go. We will now leave Sir Henry and the general to the enjoyment of each other's society-the latter to go home when he pleased (that is, when the wine-cup had been drained a few tintes)-while we follow Juniper to the provost. The rain pattered upon the sidewalk, and poured in streams from the roofs of Dutch tiles, as Juniper hurried up the street to the Park, thence to the prison where Clmningham had his qua rters. He had the good fortune to find "   REBELS AND TORIES.             49 the captain at home, though about in the act of getting into bed. On an- nouncingi himsqlf, and that he was from Sir Henry Clinton with a message of importance, Cunningham ordered him into a private room, where, in a few minutes, he waited upon him to learn the object of his untimely visit. It was stated in few words, and the letter put into his hands which had been given himl by Sir Henry. After perusing the missive, Cunnixigham threw it upon tho table before him, and turning to Juniper, with a rough and impa- tient manner, said: "This? iskurrying the business a little, I think, for Sir Henry. But you may tell, him that I have anticipated him by a few hours, for they are dead already." "I may not tell him anything of the sort. I am going home as soon as possible ; and if there is anything in S*r Henry's letter touching myself, please communicate it as soon as possible, for I have no time to lose, as in twenty-  four hours more I must leave the city." On whose business?" asked Cunningham. "On Sir Henry's," said Juniper. "Well, then, before you leave-and as early in the morning as possible- you must have ready for me two boxes of the same quality and dimensions as those you made for me to-day."  "What, more victims!" exclaimed Juniper. "Why, captain, it strikes me that you drive a better trade than any merchant in the city. What do you consider your business worth a year?" "Why, Juniper, if the war should continue, and these infernal rebels re- main as obstinate as ever, I may set it down at considerable. Are you satisfied?" "Good night! You, may expect that the boxes will be ready by noon to- morrow.. You haven't got such a thing convenient as a comforter, have you, captain?"' The tone of familiarity which Juniper assumed in the, presence of Cunning- ham was in strong contrast to his humble deportment before Sir Henry Clinton; and though it annoyed the provost, and once or twice he attempted an assumption of dignity, it only had the effect on Juniper to make him still more independent and familiar. "Come, captain," he continued, "you need not put on airs before me. We understand each other too well; and I can imagine what you would do with me if you had the opportunity and dared. You know I am not afraid of you, and that I know exactly where to place you as a man. "But that is nothing. You have done me good service, and I have rendered you other, full as im- portant; we are quits on that. So, if you'll behave like a gentleman, I will leave you, for I have business of my own to attend to, that must not be nc- glected. Therefore, if you object not, captain, I will trouble you to pass in this direction, the black bottle behind you." "Well? Juniper, you are a singular being. I never met with your like but \ nce, and heI poor fellow! was hung for murder. Good heaven! what is the matter with you? Here, a drop of this Hollands; you are ill."

Cunningham reached him a glass into which he poured some gin. which Juniper drank off at a draught, exclaiming as he did so:- ' There, there, I am better now. What a singular pain! I'm sure I thought I should have turned up. There it is again-what can it be?"And he placed his hand upon his left side. "Nothing but a momentary spasm of some kind," said Cunningham. "It will be over in a moment. I am often troubled that way myself. Take another drop of this." Thus saying, the provost filled his glass the second time, anhiswallowing it in haste, Juniper rushed into the street, glad to escape the presence of a man whom he hated, for no other reason, as he could understand, than because he fancied that Cunningham knew him betttr than he was anxious to be known.  Once in the open air, and as he thought beyond the observation of any one, he gave vent to his displeasure in thoughts audible enough to be heard by any person that had been within twenty feet of him. "Curse my fortune!" he exclaimed, with clenched fists. "Go where I will. that horrible vision will haunt me, and all eyes that I meet look upon me as though they could read my secret. And yet I would do the deed again were it to be done. Sir Henry Clinton must act as though he would sacrifice me the moment I cease to be useful; and Cunningham, too, who, one would think, has blood enough on his own skirts to answer for--he must ring notes on the same key, as though, by a species of omnipresence, he had been a witness to the deed. But that is impossible; nobody could have seen it; and then the whole deception was so perfect, that no one can possibly know the facts; and if they did I should have beon denounced long ago. Oh, cursed fate! to wade so deep, and yet acquire nothing!" And in this mood did Juniper wend his way to his own residence in Sloat Alley in a train of thought that? the meanest beggar on earth would not have envied. X\ '    CHAPTER XI. THE INVALID. TnE aunt of Upton lay on a sick-bed, and the physician who attended her expressed but a faint hope of her recovery. iHer will had been made, dividing her property, according to her peculiar fancy, between her two children, con- ditional to the performance of certain duties which she thought proper to impose. To her nephew she bequeathed but little else than advice, unless we except a gun which had belonged to his father. The prohibited apartment had never been opened, though many a longing curious glance had been directed to the door; and two or three times, there is no doubt the good matron's inquisitiveness would have gotten the better of her promise to her   REBELS  AND  TORIES.          51 brother, had she not, on sundry occasions, received satisfactory evidence of the still continued visits of the mysterious being or spirit that haunted it.

And to this pitch of independence she had been driven by a remarkably clever spinster, who, for the want of something better to do, delighted to visit her neighbors, setting them by the cars, and thereby endangering the peace of the com- munity. Sipping a cup of tea, one afternoon, with the good dame in question, the said spinster, after inveighing in the most bitter terms :ibout the ungrate- ful rebellious Americans, whom she hoped might all be hung one day, she s!uddenly struck her pipes to a new pitch as follows: "And if 1 were you, Mistress Vanderduzenhoppen, I would know whether my house should be haunted or not. Of a surety would I. I don't believe in spirits myself, and-" ' Except occasionally a little Hollands," remarked Mrs. Vanderduzenop- pen, with a smile. Well, there is something in that, my dear; but as I was saying, 1 would know what was in my own house, at all events, spirits or no spirits. And you may be sure that your lamented brother, having been gone so long, you may never see him again; and as for never opening the room, I think that must be nonsense; or at the best only a whim of your rcspectcd brother's, which he must have long ago forgotten, even if he ble alive." But how will you account for the strange noises we so often hear in it, Miss Smitchfirken?" "Why, my dear, I don't believe any more in the noises which you say you hear. than I do that I am at present standing uipon my head," exclaimed the spinster with a great deal of dignity. I am glad you don't," said Mrs. Vanderduzenhoppen ; "but what would you do were you in my place?" "Do!" exclaimed Miss-Smitchfirken ; " why, open the door, to be sure, dust the room, sweep down the cobwebs, and let in the blessed daylight once more." Will you open the door, if I give you permission?" asked Mrs. Vander- duzenhoppen. "Try me," was the emphatic answer of Miss Smitchfirken ; and she dis- torted her features into a ferocious expression of determinate courage. ' I have a great mind to," said the matron; "for as you say, I don't see why, if onie's house is one's own, why one can't do as one pleases by it. I I sometimes do think I would like to have that room, I must confess; and I don't see why John was so foolish about it. It was the pleasantest room in the house, and I have often thought that I would like it for the boys." . "That's it, you see," said Miss Smitchfirken. "There can be no harm in trying t." "But my promise to my brother!" "Nonene! What is a promise to the dead? And no doubt he is in a B  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7034-00000027"/> 52          REBELS AND    TORIES. better world than this, and cares very little about your room or your promise." "I have a great mind to. The boys are out, and nephew wont be home till late, if at all." "You lack the courage, I verily believe. Come, what say you-shall we make the adventure? You must not forget that the house is your own, and you must certainly be considered the mistress of it, as of anything else that belongs to you." "i I will try it. It wont kill a body after all, I don't believe," said Mrs. Vanderduzenhoppen; and she went to a drawer and produced a key which she said-*ald unlock the door. As she held it before the eyes of Miss Smltchfirken, the latter snatched it from her, and in an instant both women were at the door of the mysterious room. The keyfitted the lock to a nicety, but owing to its having been so many years without molestation, it was some time before Miss Smitchfirken could move the bolt, and then no sooner had the door swung upon its creaking hinges, than the two women uttered shrieks of terror, Miss Smitchfirken re- treating to the street, and Mrs. Vanderduzenhoppen swooning upon the floor. It was some moments before the matron recovered her senses, when she found the door closed as before, and the key gone. The spinster no sooner found herself in safety than she sped home as fast as possible, where it took an ex- tra visitation of the before-men'tioned Hollands, ere her nerves acquired that equilibrium so necessary to repose. What it was that had so terribly fright- ened them, neither of the inquisitives would say. At any rate, the warning was sufficiently solemn to secure for the future the privacy of the apartment. Perhaps Mrs. Vanderduzenhoppen might have had her suspicions about the matter, for, on reviving, she found written upon a scrap of paper, which had been placed between her fingers, 6ne word, in legible characters- "WAIT!"  Miss Smitchfirken might also have had her suspicions about the matter, for soon after, when her friend was taken sick, she prophesied to every one whom she knew, that "Mistress Vanderduzenhoppen would never be a well woman again; and she might as well make up her mind to it at once, as to be all the time doctoring, and spending her money for physic." And in this con- dition was she-suffering from her last sickness-when we opened this chapter. It was long past the hour of midnight, and Mrs. Vanderduzenhoppen lay tossing upon her bed of fever, with no one to watch her but a lad of about sixteen years of age) and he so fatigued that he had fallen asleep with his head upon the foot of the bed. The invalid occasionally raised herself to look at the pale features of the lad as he slept. He muttered in his unconsciousness- he was dreaming of his companions-and a tear stood in the eye of the mother, as she raised her weak form upon her elbow while she patted him affection- ately upon the check. Instantly the lad was awake, and rising, he approached the head of the bed, and wiped the moist forehead of his mother, and inquired in a voice full of affection if there was anything she wanted. "No, my child," said the mother; "Yes-you may reach me a little water, :for I am very thirsty."   REBELS AND    TORIES.          i; After drinking, she reposed again for a imoment, and then turning her eyes upon the lad. she inquired: Has William come in yet? I wonder if he ta ;cs the trouble to think of me at all? Are you sure your brother has siot come in, John?" No, mnother, he has not. I don't think he would go to bed without see- ing you." I am troubled about that boy, John. 1 am afraid he will get into difficulty with his notions about liberty. You know he has attracted the attention of Cunningham already." I think William is old enough to take care of himself, mother," said the lad, a little proudly. I don't know, John. Older people do not. Have you seen your cousin Ralph to-day?" ' No, mother; and I don't want to. 1 don't know why, but I never liked him, and I can't see that my affection grows any s-ronger by age." Such feelings are improper: John.. I am sure he seems kind enough to you. Why do you dislike him?" "Why. mother, in the first place I can't help it, and in the next, I often see him in company with persons whom I have reason to dislike. lie goes some- times to Sir Henry Clinton's, and twice I have seen him coming fromn the quarters of that tyrant Cunningham." "Well, John, he may probably go" there on business. It is not right to judge of others on account of appearances which we cannot always explain to our own satisfaction." At this moment the door opened, and both the nephew and elder son of tile sick woman entered, drenched through with the rain, and evidently excited from some cause which they refused to explain. The poor invalid was the first to speak. Looking affectionately toward her son, she said, in weak tones. of reproof: "William, what kept you so late? You know I cannot rest when you are out of an evening. Suppose anything was to happen to you? You know these are troublous times, and every one who utters a free sentiment is sus- pected."  W' ell, mother, I am surely stout enough to take care of myself. You would not have me stay here in the house moping, when I may learn some- thing or do something?" '; Do something, indeed, William. You know I am very ill." ;I can't help that, mother," said William, turning aside with a gc sthre of impatience. ' Oh, my son!" exclaimed the mother, as she brushed a tear from her eye, and turned her head to conceal her emotion. Then speaking to her nephew, "Is it very stormy out, Ralph?" "Yes, aunt, very stormy. I am sorry, for to-morrow must be my last day in the city for some time, and I have a great deal to do." Going away, Ralph! Where are you going?" asked his aunt. "To Cherry Valley, as quickly as possible. I must be on my way in thirty hours."'  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7034-00000028"/> 54         REBELS AND TORIES. "Ralph Upton, what sudden resolution is this? Have you considered the dangers you must encounter?" "I have got used to dangers, dear aunt. My only regret at leaving is that you are sick. But here are William and John to attend you; and I could be of no service, if I remained with you." "1 am sorry you are going, Ralph. What are your objects in leaving the city for the wilderness?" Tlhat I am forbidden to tell. How long I shall be gone I know not; per- haps a monthjperhaps a year." "God protect you then, if you must go. But I am sure no good will come of it. I think I can define your reasons for going; and if my suspicions are correct, I can assure you. before you go, that your mission will be in vain." "It is just possible, aunt. But unless you want me for anything to-night, I must beg leave to retire; for I have got a great deal of business to do to- morrow, and I must be stirring with the earliest dawn." "Good night, Ralph. I was expecting that William would stay up with me to-night; but he is so wet, and it is so late, I think my son had better go to bed. John, you will stay in the room with me?" "Yes, mother," said the lad, scarcely able to keep'his eyes open. "Do you want anything now?" "No, dear. William, you had better go up-stairs. I wish you could stay at home one evening. I may not give you trouble long, and I should like to talk to you." Mother, you are so fidgety. I wish you would not get sick " said Wil- liam, in no very pleasant humor, and taking a light from the table. "Good night, William!" exclaimed the mother, scarcely able to repress her emotion. "Ralph, good night!" And the nephew and son left the apartment. while the mother turned aside her head to hide her tears, and the pale fade of John again reclined upon the side of the bed to catch a moment's slumber. Oh, thoughtless youth! how little do ye regard the affection and yearning anxiety of a mother! Ye know not the sleepless moments spent in aching thought for ye! Regardless are ye of the many prayers that ascend for ye in the heavy hours of night-of the unfaltering love that watches over ye in all the mazes of a devious life-of the guardian angel that protects ye when the maternal spirit hath flown to ralns celestial!

He lay listening to the breathing of his cousin William, and to the rain pattering upon the roof; and when he was assured that his companion was asleep, and he no longer heard noises about   REBELS AND    'TRIE;S.          5 the house, he arose and dressed himself as cautiously as possible, armed himl self with a brace of pistols, and throwing over his shoulders a thick cloth sur- tout or overcoat, quietly descended the stairs, and let himself out into the street without exciting the attention of the family. Casting a hasty glance along the street to observe if he was watched, he passed hastily through Sloat Lane into Hanovrr Square, thence into Wall Street, the foot of which he soon reached, where e paused a moment to look about him and listen; but he heard no other scunds than the drizzle of the rain and the splashing of the water against tli sides of the ships and keys. Turning then to his left, he pursued his way along the docks till he came in front of a low, hovel-like sort of a building, whence issued the voices of men in talk and laughter, and the vile squeaking ofa violin. Knocking loudly at the door, his summons was answered by a grif voice, which bade him come in, if he were " the devil's self." On makin the attempt, however, he found that the door was bolted and barred; and giving three or four more knocks, louder than the first, the same voice from within again cried out: "Avast! witho it there, ship-mate, till I make an observation; for maybe you are the devil, or the captain, and in that case there'd have to be a bit of an argument." Ralph began to get impatient, when one of the panels of the door was par- tially slid aside, a-id the aperture was filled by the rough and unshaven face of a person, in sailor attire; who proposed the following questions: "Who are you? what's your name?" "Gelson," said Ralph, thinking the question or the fact of no importance, and not wishing to give his own name, or the 7gnormen by which he was known to Sir Her ry Clinton.      J "Kelson!" exclaimed the other, ; are you aon?" "Yes!" "Does it rain o it much?" Yes. Anythi ig more?" asked Ralph, with impatience, yet sensible that he could only attain his desire by patience. ' Which way is the wind, slip-mate?" asked the other, most provokingly. "South-cast!" exclaimed Ralph, so snappishy, that the questioner started back from an involnltary fear for the safety of his nose. "Three cheers for old Jack! Then the 'Polly' can't go out of port to- morrow. Hoo-rah!" and in his joy at this intelligence, the old fellow within had entirely forgotten Ralph, and was closing the panel, when the latter thrust in his harid:6 prevent it, at the same time exclaiming: "Come, old-tar! have you forgotten me? Open the door." "Cat-harpings and braces! but I was a-going to stop you on short allow- ance, wern't I? What do you want?" "Rem Zinder, the boatman," answered Ralph. "Aint here, my hearty," said the other. "Yes yes! yes!" exclaimed half-a-dozen voices. Rem is here." iullo! Rem, you're wanted at the door. A strongly built young man of about five and twenty, dressed in the Dutch  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7034-00000029"/> 56          REBELS AND   TORIES. sailor costume of the day, now came forward from the corner of the room, saying, as he approached the door: . "Why did you want to fool so long with the stranger, Derrick, such a wet night as this, instead of opening the door at once?" "He'll get used to it, Rem. It aint nothing to the middle watch at night, under close reef,the wind blowing big guns, and the waves running over your deck like mountains, and following one another so fast that there aint room to catch breath between. You river- craft don't know nothing." Rem took no notice, however, of Derrick's argument, but proceeded at once to open the door, when Ralph was admitted into the room, which was filled with sailors, boatmen, dockmen, and the usual sprinkling of that class of men who are generally found lounging in such places, but whose profession or call- ing attaches them to no particular body. As he entered, Ralph cast a glance among them, but recognized no face that he knew, with the exception of Rem Zinder's, while they all in return cast upon him looks of mingled curiosity and distrust. Whispering to Rem that his business lay solely with him, he was led aside, where he communicated his desire to cross the river to Brook- lyn, with as little delay as possible. ' Well, Ralph," replied the boatman, "I would do as much to please you as most anybody; but you know I seldom make the attempt so late at night as this without a good fee, and doubly a good fee to leave comfortable quar- ters for a wet boat and a drenching into the bargain." "You shall have a crown for your trouble if you will about it at once," said Ralph. ("Yonder dark stranger in the corner has offered me twice that, and I re- fused," said Rem, pointing to a figure wrapped in a sort of military cloak, who sat upon a chest in an obscure part of the room, and who had ecaped the no- tice of Ralph when he entered. "Who is he, Rem?" inquired Ralph, casting his eye toward the stranger, as though he would penetrate the mystery of the cloak. ' That is more than 1 can tell you, Ralph,' said Rem. "He is a decent enough fellow, as far as I can see ;--perhaps he may be one of the rebel chiefs for all that I know." "No matter," said Ralph, "I must cross at all hazards, and if two crowns is your price, I must pay it, which, with the stranger's two will make for- good pay, I take it, for an hour on the river." "But I did not say I would take you for two," exclaimed Rem. "But you must, and I must cross, for the business is of the most vital importance, and delay might be ruinous." 'Saying which, Ralph pulled Zinder toward him, and whispered a few words in his ear. "That makes a difference by the wholesale," exclaimed Rem, turning from Ralph to his companions, Twho had become quite silent during this interview, so curious were they to know the nmeaning of it; though to their senses the whole affair was as mysterious as ever. lIe addressed them: "Now, friends, be light with your fun till I come back, for I dont want to lose much by my absence. I have just to take this youngster, and that   R E B E L S   A D TO R E .          57 stranger in the corner yonder, across to Brooklyn. and will be back in an hour at the most, and as much sooner as possible, you may depend on it." At this the sailor who had first questioned Ralph through the panel of the door. rose fronbhis seat, and pouring into a tin cup which he held in his hand, full three inches of prime West India. he threw himself into an attitude, exclaiming: "Stop! Let no man stir from this house of royal entertainment till he has pledged the king's health in three fingers of the best; and let me see the traitor who refuses." This speech was received vociferously by the party present, with the excep- tion of Rem. Ralph, and the, stranger-one of them rising and proposing three cheers for old Dlerrick. This was likewise as boisterously acceeded to and effected. and the party began to crowd around a circular table that stoo(d in the middle of the rooml. upon which sat a dozen or more tin drinking cups, in the midst of which stood a large black flask about two-thirds full of West India rum. When the more noisy of the party had clharged their cups, Zander and Ralph stepped forward for the same purpose; but the stranger still sat moodily apart without deigning to rise. Seeing this, Derrick with one or two strides across the room, approached the unknown, and endeavoring to peer under the slouched hat which lie wore, addressed hilm thus: "You may be an admiIal, thoughl I don't believe it; nor do I believe you're Lord Howe in disguise, and I don't care if you are the devil himself; but if ;? y name's Boom Derrick and you've got any at all, and you don't drink tilm king's health in three fingers, then if I don't make your standing rigging come down iwith a run. say I don't know a mop-stick from a marlinspike!" Contrary to the expectations of Derrick and a few of his associates, this terrific speech seemied to have no cffect upon the stranger's nerves; but par- tially raising his hat from his brow, he arose without speaking, and fixing - upon the bullying sailor a glance thIt made him quail, he approached the I table, poured into a. cup the requisite draught, and stood waiting for the - . pledge ; and no one in the company did him the injustice io think that his performance of the act was through fear from the threat of Derrick. After a moment's silence, the toast was given by the sailor- "Health and a long reign to King George, and confusion to all his enlemies i -dlamn the rebels!! :' The toast was drunk with three times three, while one voice sang out- A"And (uble rations of grog to sailors"-received with equal applause. The strangerkdrank off his cup, and as lie placed it on the table, but one person in the rooim observed that he was considerably agitated, and muttered some- thing bitter between his teeth. Tllis was Ralph. Some argument now arose betwixt a sailor at; a boatman, in which Derrick took a part, and as it grew warmer, others gathered round to hear the matter of the dispute. Taking advantage of this, Rem whispered to Ralph that he was ready to depart, and motioning the stranger to follow them, he took a couple of oars from a corner of the room, opened the door, and the three were soon on their way to the boat of Zinder. which lay in the slip near the Fly Market: at the foot of Crown Street, now a portion of Maiden Lane.

The tide was setting strongly up, which somewhat assisted the boatman, when once clear of the slips, as both Ralph and the stranger had desired to be landed at the ferry, which was a little above the line of their debarkation at the city. During the passage over, not a word was spoken by either party, the stranger, in particular, preserving the utmost taciturnity; and they were no sooner landed, than, paying Zinder his two crowns, he hurried away in the direction of the Wallebocht, while Ralph, as he paid his passage money, remarked to Rem, "I would give a guinea to know who that man is-a rebel, doubtless." "You will scarcely find out in the dark of this night, I am thinking," said Zinder. "Let him go," said Ralph. "Now can you tell me where I can procure a horse, for I have to get on so far as Flathush to-night." "Go to Rem Remsen's, tell him whose business you are upon, and he will furnish you with a horse in a twinkling. "But it is so late they have probably all retired." "Make nothing of that, for I am sure he won't. Knock loudly, tell him what you want, and he will send out one of his negroes to assist you." f "Thank you. Good night, Rem!"          . "Luck to you, Ralph-good night!" exclaimed Rem in reply, as he shoved off his boat. Leaving the boatman to return to the city, Ralph moved forward in the direction of Remsen's, where he soonarrived, and found the proprietor of the house on his stoop, taking his last peep at (he weather previous to his retiring for the night. Ralph hastened forward to make himself known, in which act he stumbled, striking Remsen so violently in the stomach, that the latter began to think he was assaulted by rebels, whom he had reason to suspect bore no love toward him since the submission of Kings county, wherein he swore to "' be faithful, and bear true allegiance to His Majesty King George the Third," and to " defend his crown and dignity against all persons whatsoever."* "Hoist! fellow! what rudeness is this?" exclaimed Remsen, staggering ,backward, partially from the effects of the blow he had received, and not a little through fear or astonishment.

What brings you on this side the river so late at night? I You've been sparking, no doubt." "By orders of Sir Hnry Clinton. I must reach Flathush with the least delay, and am referred to you as a proper person to furnish me with a horse," said Ralph. * The following is the oath taken and subscribed by four hundred and two citizens of , Kings county, in November following the Battle of Long Island :-"I do sincerely prom- ise and swear, that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty, King George the Third, and that I will defend his crown and dignity against all persons whatsoever. So help me God."   IREBELS AND TORi E r             51) "Why. bless my soul, young man!" exclaimed Remsen, -: I keep no horses to let." "Remember your oath, Mr. Reilsen," said Ralph. - I have no doubt you can furnish me with a horse; and Sir Henry would think very strangely' of it if my expedition should fail on account of your refilsal to loan me a horse." "In that case, young man, I will call (Gaf," said Remscn, as hle sung out at the top of his voice the name of a square built, Dutch rigged negro, who presently came toddling along from the back kitchen of the house. As ihe appeared, Remsen asked him if there was a horse in the stable in fit conditiod" to go to Flathush. "What, massa," said Gaff, "de sorrel one, wid de bol tail and de hog i4aLne? Yes, I guess so."  No, the iron grey. Put on a saddle and bridle and Ari him to the door in less than a minute."  The negro started for the stable, but a rod or two from t e house,' mutter- ing as he went, "Well, by Gosh! am massa crazy to len  ( de best hoss in de town to de fuss man come."                     a "Gaff thinks the iron grey too good for everylody to ride&amp; and he's a pet horse of the negro's.

'i I am obliged to you for your kindness, Mr. Remsen," said Ralph, "I will be careful of him. and for any urging I may give him out, I will be the easier on him back." "Nevtr fear him; that distance will be nothing to him. But here he comes lively enough, I'm thinking." The horse now came prancing forward, led by the negro. who was caressing him, and talking to him like a creature of reason. Ralph approached, and in an instant was in the saddle, while the noble beast feeling the weight of a stranger, bounded 'forward, and was soon lost in the darkness to Remscu and Gafft the one not having time to give Ralph a parting salutation, nor the other to give the sides of his pet animal a few consolatory pats. Taking the most direct road to Flathush, Ralph passed successively the Dutch stone-church, which was the alarm post on the night of the retreat of the American army, across' the line of fortifications extending from the Walla- bout to the mill at Gowanus Creek, thence on to the woody heights beyond. In the meantime, Marrcner had landed at New Utrecht, anticipating his first proposed action from an apprehension that his movements had been watched, and anxious to accomplish the object of his expedition before steps should be taken to prevent it. Under his command were about twenty memn, from Lord Sterling's division. Regardless of the inclemency of the weather, and the wretched state of the roads, they hurried forward with the utmost *A  place near Flatlads, where, during the war, British officers indulged in the sport of racing, fox hunting, &amp;c /         1 , ,  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7034-00000031"/> 60          REBELS  AND TrosIES. dispatch to Flatlands, though a more circuitous toute, for the purpose of halt- ing for a few minutes at the house of a whig friend to refresh themselves and gain information regarding the disposition of the enemy. This man's name was Johnson. He was kind hearted, but shrewd; and a staunch friend to the colonies, though, as a republican, he managed to conduct his affairs so as not to be suspected by the British, whom he always treated with extreme courtesy, gaining in return much valuable information that he communicated to the rebellious Americans. Marrener and his companions met with a cor- dial reception, the best in the house was provided for them, and a bumper round of the choicest spirits to enliven them, and keep the dampness of the evening from spoiling their stomachs. Then the host had much to tell them, which he communicated almost in whispers; and after another round at the bottle, the little band of adventurers departed, with Johnson's best wishes for their success and a safe return. We will now leave them to pursue their way in the direction of Flathush, while we rejoin our friend Juniper, or Ralph, or whichever you may choose to call him. We may premise, however, that, in point of time, he was some- what in the rear of the men whose mission it was thought he would so hap- pily intercept: in fact, at the very moment that William Marrener and his companions were taking their refreshments at Johnson's. Ralph was waiting npon Remsen for his horse; so that in reality the former had less thain three miles to go, though they were walking, while the latter, after waiting for his horse, had a distance of almost five miles to ride, a great portion of it over a bad and hilly road. After Ralph was once in the saddle, however, he rode rapidly, and in an incredible short space of time he was in the immediate neighborhood of Flat- bush, and going into the town at a dashing rate. But so fast had hOridden all the way, and so much occupied was he with other thoughts, that he had not noticed he was followed most of the distance by a person mounted upon a powerful bjack charger, who seemed to skip the ground like a bird. To be sure, once in a dismal part of the road he had noticed that a horseman crossed his path so directly in front of him, that he was about to speak, but that the stranger rode so clos him that the mane of his steed brushed the nostrils of his own horse as he passed, startling him so as almost to throw him upon his haunches, and precipitate his rider to the ground. Recovering himself. Ralph would have shouted after him, but the stranger was beyond sight, and nothing could be heard but the clattering of his horse's hoofs in the distance. Now let us again shift the scene, where we shall once more find Marrener and his companions. They had halted just on the outskirts of the village, and were conisulting as to the best mode of attack. Most of them were for imme- diate action, while their leader proposed a reconnoitre. This latter plan was finally agreed upon, and parties of two were about starting for that purpose; when they were interrupted by a horlsemoln. who dashed in amongst them and eagerly asked to see the captain of the band.' Marrener at once presented himself to the stranger, demanding his business. "You are on an expedition now to liberate some of your friends in Flat- bush, and make prisoneri of a few obnoxious tories," said the horseman.. ,bs, an,  nk  ioe   REBELS' AND   TORIES.           61 "Well, sir," said Marrener. : suppose I say, no! what proof have you to the contrary?"  I know it," said the horseman. ' It is your intention to surprise Major Moncriffe, Mr. Bache, Miles Sherbrook, Van Cortlandt, and others. You also intend to liberate Colonel John Flahaven, lately billeted on Jacob Suy- dam, but he has been removed. Do I know anything about your move- ments?" '"More than the devil docs, or than is safe for you to know. By what al- thority do you speak?" By the fiend's, belike," replied the stranger. When the night frowns and the storm howls, I am seeking. I am here to-day, yonder to-morrow; in tlhe councils of the red man, or in the camp of his half savage white brother." - But where come you from?" asked Marrener. "Throw aside your cloak -are you friend or foe?" "Both! no fish swims deeper-no bird soars higher. Sometimes the temx- pest sings to me-sometimes the winds chide me. But I care not. Spirits of the air nor fiends of the earth harm me; but I know what I know. Shall I tell you?" "Iow learned you what you have already told?" asked Marrener. ' It is th 4hlk of the city. Even now you are suspected, and. a courier goes forward with the alarm. Ere the moon gets grey, the provost will have his key on you." i      - "Speak you truly, stranger? for by soul you are in strange company to tell such falsehoods to." "Pshaw! For what are cars to a fool. There are wild birds of better :scent, and the mole has more cunning! Hark!" The party listened. Coming on toward them they could hear the clattering of a horse's feet as lie leaped forward upon the road; and in a moment more the quick panting of the animal as he was urged along, and( te voice of the rider as he encouraged him.  "What means this?" asked Marrener, impatiently. "Are we betrayed?" "Ha! ha!" laughed the stranger, as he wheeled his horse, "Yes! There goes the warning to Moncrieffe, Axtcll, Bache and Sherbrook! You have been betrayed!" Marriner gnashed his teeth with rage. Ho hardly knew what to think of the strange being before him-whether to doubt or to believe, and the horse of the other rider, was now but a few rods from them, and in a bound or two more would be past them. He was again about to address the stranger, when he saw him gather himself in his stirrups, as if for a charge, and in the next instant, as the other horseman apeared in sight, lie upon the black charger spurred his animal across the road with a movement so skilful, that the other was struck in the shoulder with such force as almost to throw him, while his rider was flung violently to the ground, at a distance of several feet; lIarrener and his party were the surprised spectators of this scene ; and while two of them started forward to secure the animal thus liberated from control, the rest gathered round the fallen man to learn the cause or reason of this disaster. He was found to be uninjured, having been thrown into a clump of bushes by  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7034-00000032"/> 62          REBELS AND TORIES. the roadside. he was led forward to where, upon his impatient animal, sat the strange horseman, and when found that he was unhurt, questioned as to his motives for travelling at such speed at such 'an unseasonable hour of the night, when sober citizens, themselves of course excepted, should be in comfortable l beds. To these questions Ralph would give no satisfactory answers ; and Marrener was about to hint of coercive measures to make him communicative, when the two men who had gone in pursuit of the horse, returned with him, exclaiming as they came forward : "Why, here is Rem Remsen's iron grey, the fastest horse in the county. A prize! a prize!" "' On my life it is!" exclaimed Marrener, as he patted the sides of the ani- mal! ' There is something wrong here-either the horse is stolen, or you are going on an errand for the devil! What say you, young man? Will you speak?"  By what authority do you ask questions,?" muttered Ralph. "By what authority! That is good!" exclaimed Marrener, laughing with disdainful mockery. "Look around you. You may see a dozen of 'us, tole- rably hale and strong men, and' you ask me ' by what authority.'" "I deny the right. If you are honest men, let me-go ; if you are robbers I lhave nothing for you." a We are not robbers, but I am not sure that we are honest men-that de- pends upon the king's proclamation. What is your business, that you were in uilch haste?" "Well, then, gentlemen," said Ralph, " as I am caught, I suppose I might as well confess.. I am bound into Fiathush, from some friends of Captain Flahaven, to tell him to be ready to-morrow inight, as an attempt will be made to liberate him." I' Liarjs" exclaimed he upon the black horse. in deep gutteral tones. All eyes were turned toward the mysterious horseman as he spoke, and Marrener, approaching him, said: "And what do you know about it? and how know you he is a liar 7?" "Search him!" exclaimed the same voice again. Trwo of the men now seized Ralph, whilst Marrener searched his pockets, and in spite of his endeavors i conceal something which he had about him, they managed at length to extract from the inside of his vest, a letter, which, by a light that they soon struck, they saw was directed to Colonel Axtell, with the information and advice as communicated by General Robertson. Byr the light of the lantern, Marrener read it to his companions, and when he had finished there was one general howl of indignation. They would have rushedS upon and torn Ralph to pieces at once, if they had been permitted. Marrener, however, addressed them, showing them how the finger of Providence haWl manifested itself in the detection of this infamous tory ; and how much bet ter it would be for them to let him off with some milder punishment than, death, as so far he really had effected nothing, having been detected in time to save the results of their expedition. This proposition was received without a dissenting voice. lie continued: ' And now the horse which you claim as a prize; he will be worse than   REBELS   AND  TORIES.           63 valueless to any of us. He will serve as a guide to our enemies in their search for the perpetrators of this night's ouztrage, as' they will call it; and as we can make a better use of him, I propose this: I have heard Remsen boast bhat this horse, turned loose fifty miles from home, would find his way back again to his own stall quicker than another horse could follow him. Let us see how he will do it on a small scale, and in doing this, we will at the same time give this young tory a lesson that he will not soon forget. We will place him upon the horse's back, and there tie him so fast that he cannot be thrown; tie his hands behind him, draw the bridle from the animal's head, and then see which way the beast will run. He is sure-footed, and no harm can be done. So hurrah for the fun!" This-proposition was received with applause and shouts of laughter by the rest; and instant measures were taken to effect this singular mode of punish- ment. Cords were procured, for the party had taken care to provide a suffi- cient quantity of this article for other purposes-and seizing Ralph, in spite of all remonstrance or struggle, they tied his hands behind him, then mounted him upon the horse, backward, and fastened him there so securely that there could be no danger of his being thrown, or turned in the saddle. After all the preliminaries were adjusted to his satisfaction, Marrener addressed him in this fashion: "And now, young man, if you escape from this adventure without broken bones, let me advise you to turn honest and consort with better men; else, if you come many times into the hands of Bill Marrener you will be likely to find a jacket of another color. lMy compliments to Remsen, and say, he has a very fine horse, which, on another occasion, I should fall in love with; and 'r to Sir Henry Clinton and General Robertson that I should be happy to break a bottle of wine with them; likewise, that I will give them a thousand dollars if they will tell me where they got the information that led them to dispatch you to Flathush. So good bye!" In an instant the bridle was pulled from the horse's head, and he bounded  forward and struck down the road in the direction of, Brooklyn, at a terrific rate, followed by the shouts of Marrener and his comrades. At the same time the strange horseman uttered a yell of wild laughter, and, dashing his spurs into the sides of his animal, darted down the lighway after Ralph at a speed that made the fire fly from the flinty pebbles of the road. And down, as far as the ear could detect a sound, were heard the clattering hoofs of the fleeing and pursuing steeds, and above this the shrill ringing of a maniac laugh that made the blood curdle in the veis of the listeners many a day after. But Ralph fled on as on the wings of the lightning! He thought not of' the imminent peril he was in. He had no desire but to urge faster the fright- ened animal which he bestrodoe!-he heard nothing but that fearful laugh which seemed ever to pursue him! W ere his thoughts then of Rowlcy? Remembered he then that dreadful night of crime, which the ocean could never cleanse him from! Heard he not still ringing in his cars the awful salutation that was given him on the oommispion of the fatal deed! Ha! must he wade through years of such agony, and be no nearer attonement  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7034-00000033"/> "         REBELS   AND TORIES. than at first! Must the pale ghost of the murdered man for ever haunt him, immortal as it was! IIow weak a mar, was he, that he could not annihilate the memory of the act with the sapme case that he took the life of his friend! Still onward sped the frightenej :,.e d, and after them, and sometimes si4 by side, rode the strange horsemrn irpon his black charger! And now, preparatory to entering Flathush, Marrener called together his men, and divided them into four pa,'ties. At the head of one party he placed himself. and to the others he apI ci-;eu leaders of undoubted sagacity and bravery. He then addressed thcm as follows: "Now, men, what we have to do must be done as quietly and as easily as possible. You must proceed to your several points of attack in such a man- ner as not to give the alarm to any of the prowling inhabitants of the place, if any such be stirring at an hour so unseasonable. If any fool should be so injudicious as to threates ail alarm, seize hiin at once and gag him-no matter with what, so that you stop his bawling throat. We have had enough of this British tyranny, and who shall blame us for hating them! Remember Hale! If obstructed, fight like pirates! for you know .7hat their mercy is worth. Strike a blow for every American heart that has rotted in the hulks of their detes'ted prison ships!-for every despairing groan that their hatch ways could not pre',ent ascending to heaven, till every sigh of the suffering prisoner became a curse! Shall we hate these English hounds? For ever! for never was w-'r so inhuman!-never barbarities so fiendish! Look atl broken treaties and outraged faith! Remember what elements they have enlisted agairst us and the fair cause of freedom! Think of the desolated hearths, made desolate by mercenary soldiers-the slaves of a beggared prince -Hessian dogs! Forget not the cries of mothers and children whose scalps hang in the wigwams of those blood-hounds, the Indians, who have been shouted on by the despicable tools of British misrule! What! shall we not for these things bequeath a rich legacy'of hatred to unborn generations, whose forefathers have fell slaughtered by war, by famine, and by disease! Then if such tyranny breeds damnation, if revenge is an ingredient of nature, if memory will treasure such things, let us never rest till the foot of the invader no longer pollutes the soil upon which men have sworn to be free! Com- rades, are these our sentiments?" We were not faithful chronicler to say that these were not grateful senti- ments; for as Marrener appealed to them, they would have shown their ap- proval with cheers three times three; but his quick eye detected the move- ment, and with a gesture he motioned them to be silent; but every hat was off its wearer's head, and thrice waved in the air. "And now, my lads," resumed Marrener, "we are each members of the same body, and pledged to each other's support, and where one suffers so must the whole. Now, let us move forward. At the church we must sepa- rate, and to each party I have apportioned a separate task. You, Walter Young, shall lead your men to the residence of Colonel Axtell; you, yours, Chris. Warren, to Major Matthews'; Ben Mason, you may lead your party around to the house of Mr. Bache. Each proceed with the utmost caution, and take with you heavy clubs for the purpose of breaking in the doors. As iUU             --a r*Ur3uIwrl u/v v rirvv v "'"'   REBELS AND    TORIES.           6  for myself, I have an old friend I wish to see in the person of one Miles Sher- brook. He has tried too often to do me good service, at the same time favgring the king, and such friendship I do not often forget. However, I don't fiatter yself that there will be mutual joy in our meeting; but I shall oblige imn as far as possible by tending him an escort to my own mansionv in v\ew Jersey. Now, let us move forward, as I suppose by this time Remscn's horse is far enough hence with his rider to permit us to proceed with becom- ing propriety." Marrener and his men now resumed their march, and as they arrived at the church, they divided into four parties, as previously arranged, each bent upon its separate duty. As soon as Marrener had seen the departure of the three divisions led by Young, Warren and Mason; he directed his own steps, fol- lowed by four men, toward the residence of George Martense, beneath whose roof Sherbrook had taken up his quarters. Arriving at the house, Marrcner concluded at firstlo knock for admission; but on the first summons of this sort, a window Afove him was quickly raised, a black head stuck out, and as hastily withdrawn, the window came down with a slam, followed by impatient footsteps up a staircase into the story above. Not desiring to wait for an alarm, lMarrcner seized a billet' of wood from one of his men, and by a few sturdy blows succeeded in forcing the door and aecting an entrance into tlhe hall. Here lie and his men .were met by two or three black servants, who, with various implements of household furniture, endeavored to oppose them. What were these in the hands of resolute and desperate men! In an instant they were sprawling upon the floor, crying murder and thieves! while Mar- rener and his men, leaping over them, sprang up the stairway with the agility of cats. At the head of the first flight, he turned round, and seeing  the whole tour about him, he sang out in a tone of anger: ".Fools! what are you about! Two of you are enough here-look to the door!-guard against surprise. Down, Forbes! down; Deering!" The two men addressed descended the stairway just in time to reach the door as one of the negroes, revived from the stunning effects of the blow that felled him, was about giving an alarm in the street. 'Seizing the poor fellow by the throat, Forbes hurled him back with such force, that striking the cellar door, it burst open, and down rolled the African to regions below, crying as he went: I: Lord, massa! good massa! I'm killed! I'm murdered!" In the mean time, Marrener, meeting the old Dutch housc-keeper, en dis-  habille, and frightened most out of her wits, ordered her to bring hint a candle, and show him the room of Mr. Sherbrook. As quick as confusion wold let her she obeyed, but on entering the room of the person lie sought, he found that the bird had flown, though the nest was warm. Furious withl rage and disappointment, he searched every nook and corner of that story. and then flew up another flight of stairs into the garret, and there, behind the old Dutch chimney, shivering with fear, and with breeches in hand, crouched the redoubtable Miles Sherbrook. In spite of Marrener's anxiety to perform a hasty business, and his enmity to the tory, our adventurer, for a moment could but stand and laugh. The rueful countenance of the mau before him, 5  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7034-00000034"/> "         REBELS AND    TORIES. the ludicious situation in which he found him was more than he could com- prehend without giving vent to a most uproarious and undignified burst of laughter, in which he was joined by the two men who had followed him up stairs, and even the old house-keeper, whose sex's curiosity had tempted her l to tread upon the heels of the invading party. "My dear Sherbrook!" said Marrener, mockingly, "You know that I love you as you do myself; and so you must really excuse this unseemly and improper mirth at one in your melancholy situation; but how, in heaven's name tell me, how did you make out to squeeze yourself in there? Do me the favor to explain, my good friend-do!" "You have the advantage of me, Sir," said Sherbrook indignantly, " if you can find any reason in your contemptible mirth. Perhaps you can explain i  the cause of this untimely visit, if I am the object of it:." "Oh, sir," said Marrener, "I have never met misuse at your hands! You never threw a straw in my way, nor insulted me in the presence of gentle- men! You never offered an hundred dollars to any one that would catch me alive, as you could make your fortune by showing a green Yankee to the cockneys of London! Here am I now, sir, without stipulating for the re- ward but with such precious love for you, knowing you to be a genuine and ^s^aluable tory, that I must rather press you to make my house your home until exchanged for some of those damned rebels, so styled by the hired sol- diers of the king! Have I explained myself?" "Your purpose, sir, then, is robbery--perhaps murder!" exclaimed Sher- brook scornfully. "Crack him over the head, and stop the wagging of his blasted tory tongue!" exclaimed one of the men who stood behind Marrener. "No, Jones," said Marrener, " such brutality we leave to be practised by our foes. To be rebels is bad enough in their eyes. Our cause is not yet so hopeless as to make assassins of us. -The record of crime is black enough al- ready without our adding anything to the calendar." "You is a man so right as never vas!" exclaimed the old housekeeper. "Come, Mynheer Sherbrook, put on your breeches and go mit the gentleman. You shall be treat like a prince in disguise I shall warrant. Put on your breeches or you will be freeze like one poker stiff, you shall never know it." "But I shall first kniow the determination of these g-entlenzen here, before I condescend to move," said WMr. Sherbrook. "Dont make yourself ridiculous by resisting, sir, if you please, as we should hate to use force to induce you to act as we desire." "Yaw, Yaw, Yaw! Dat ish good atvice; the shentlemen is so much your friend 1  as never; so put on your breeches and go mit him so soon directly." \   This trifling was beyond the patience of Marrener; and finding that Sher- " i  brook did not seem inclined to breech himself, he ordered his men to seize him and take him down to the street. No sooner was the order given than in spite of his struggles and curses, our redoubtable tory was seized in a manner somewhat unceremonious, and forcibly carried to the street. By this time the uproar in the .house began to increase. and Marrener judged it pru-   KEBrELS AND     TOR IS.  dent to be off' with his prize as fast as possible. At the door of the lhoulse he found the nhcroes who had first opposed his entrance had succeeded in raising a tolerable mob; and for a moment he began to think that he had gotten himself into difficulty. Sherbrook saw at a glance the situation of things, and began to cry lustily for a rescue, till one of the men who had chanrge or him, struck him across the mouth with the flat of his hand; at the same time Marrener saw, crossing the street in the direction of the house, ten of his own men under the command of Walter Young and Cris. Warren. These were the divisions to which had been assigned the duty of securing the lersons of Colonel Axtell and Mayor Matthews. They had, however, been unsuccessful, as both these gentlemen were at the time in the city. They brought the intelligence, nevertheless, that the party under Ben Mason, sent to secure the person of Mr. BachO, had succeeded, and were already on their way to the place of rendezvous-the old lulrch.  This intelligence determined the mind of Marrener at once; and finding himself now   surrounded with fourteen Strong and resolute men, he concluded if necessary, to cut his way out of the village.  Seizing his musket by the muzzle, he swung the but around hinm clearing a path for his men to whom he shouted to follow him. Taking example from the courage of their leader, they rallied after him, and at length the crowd was forced to give way till a passage w s effected for them through which they carried their prisoner in triumph. Before they reached the churclh however, they found they were pursued by the Flathush Gulards, and quite a smart engagement took place, in which two of Marrener's men were wounded and one of the guards killed. This for a few moments cllhecked the pursuit, but they had no sooner reached the church, and rejoined the rest of their comrn rades, than the citizens began to turn out in pursuit, which now became hot grom all quarters. No longer stay w'as made at the church than to give Sherbrook time to don his breeches. The forces of the pursuers now began to increase, and Marrener thought for a moment that the chances were greatly against him. But there was no such ingredient in his nature as despair, and with brief words of encouragement to his men, and summoning to his own support the most indomitable courage, he determined to face out the danger, be it never so great. Ere they had proceeded a  quarter of a mile firom the church, the bell sounded the alarm, and he could hear the tramp of multitudes, and the hallooing of the mob, following in his wake. As fast as weary legs could carry  them they fled from their pursuers, and the chase became an eager on  e, and the distance visibly lessened betwixt the parties, and Marrener could often hear his name shouted with execrations, by voices which lie could recognize. On   fled Marrener and his men, and on cavme the inhabitants, led by the redoubtable Flathush Guards. Shot after shot was thrown away al random, falling harmlessly about the rebel adventurers. till another of Mar- rener's men was shot in the leg, and so disabled as to be unable to fly firther. This man was a   friend of the rebel chief. At this accident, the leader of the band commanded a    halt. To stand at bay against such odds was mnane..s and so he determined upon a parley. Ordering his two captives in front. facing the pursuers. Marrener, as soon  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7034-00000035"/> 68          REBELS   AND  TORIES. the people of Flathush were near enough to hear him, spoke in a loud and de- cisive tone of voice as follows: "Citizens of Flathush, a parley. Don't mistake me-I am not going to surrender. You must cease this hostile demonstration-I must depart in peace. Return to your homes,-guiltless of murder; for I swear to you-and you know I am a man of my word.-that, in my retreat, if I am followed an- other step, or menaced by another shot, I will blow out the brains of these men here, my prisoners, Miles Sherbrook and Theophylus Bache-and their blood be upon your own heads. If you cease this pursuit, their lives are saved-on my honor I pledge you. I am a man of few words-I hope I am understood." Turning then to his prisoners, he said to them; Gentlemen, I know you wish this mob to disperse. Say so to them." The persons to whom he spoke knew the alternative, and addressed their fellow-citizens as he desired; when Marrener, again raising his voice, told the people that he would give them five minutes to decide; but, ere the five minutes had elapsed, the crowd that had followed him so fiercely, turned and marched quietly back to their homes, only greeting him with a few groans and hisses by way of parting salutation. And Marrener regained his boats without further molestation, and early in the forenoon he landed safely in New Jersey with his prisoners. , CHAPTER XIII. THE FLIGHT AND RETURN. As swiftly as Ralph rode out of Brooklyn, still more swiftly returned he; and though Remsen might have bragged never so much about the instinct of Iron Grey in returning to his, stall from fifty miles away, the boasting in this instance was not belied. Pursued by the wild horseman nearly into Brooklyn, with his face to the crupper of the grey, the ground was passed at no snail's pace, but rather an eaglets flight. At times his unknown and terrible com- panion would ride so close to him as to peer into his face with a grin of fiend- like malice, at times chaunting as he rode along: "Hark to the dead man's shriek of wo Come up from the watery depths below! While over the guhwale of the boat The murderer leans, to see round him float The bubbles from the dead man's breath! And hark! the accusing cry ascends, And with the wail of the night-wind blends; And the murderer's eye of red despair Sees naught but the cose's floating hair, And the pale, cold face of death! Ha! ha!! ha! a! what a shout of glee In Hell for that dark night's revelry!   REBELS AND TORIES.             69 "Ho! ho! ride faster, young master, for the fates have plotted much for you to do, and the hours fly, and their sands are gold! So, ride ride!" "The devil curse you!" shrieked Ralph, in fury, as the horse stumbled and almost fell in leaping a ditch upon the roadside to make a near-cut home." The wild horseman did not follow him, but as his steed leaped from the road. he shouted after him: "So speed, Ralph Upton! for the horse is tired of his rider. But keep a good heart, and ride merrily, and better fortune next time!" Saying this he struck off into the road that led toward the Narrows, and in a few moments more, Ralph, upon the Iron Grey, was in the stableyard of Remsen, crying lustily for help, while every bone in his body ached from the rude exercise of his ride. The first person who came to his assistance was Gath the black hostler, who, recognising his favorite animal, and perceiving the situation of Ralph, burst into a violent fit of laughter as he exclaimed, "What de debel is de matter, massa? Why you know how to ride de hoss, eh? Gorra! yah, yah! but dat am de most funniest ting I eber did see! What de matter-what de matter?" "Cease your humor, you black imp, and cut these cords about my feet." "Stop fust i" said the negro, with a provoking coolness. "I must fist go call massa. Gorra! he would neber miss de seeing you in this fix for five dollars." And the black rascal chuckled over the pleasure which he antici- pated his master would derive from this novel mode of taking a ride. Ralph's ankles and back were aching terribly, and his patience was exhausted by the negro's nonchalance. "Your master shall break your head for you, you scoundrel!" he exclaimed. "Don't you see that 1 am bound upon this horse. and cannot help myself, if I could, I would make your bones ache, I'll warrant." "Yes, mass-yah, yah! Dat's what I want massa Rem to see too. Iim like fun most dreadful." "The furies curse you!" shouted Ralph. "Will you cease your gabble, and bring me assistance as quickly as possible!" "Wlat! noffen for de ole niggar, eh? You see 'se gettin pooty ole. Dus you see my grey hair, and talk so, eh? Dis niggar blossoming for do grave-he am!   Well, well, how disparagemen dis warl am gettin', I golly!"  In fact, the negro did not seem inclined to move, and this delay, together with the impatience of Ralph, caused the other to rattle out a string of oaths of magnitude enough to frighten a tolerably brave man out of his senses. The old negro gazed at him till his eyes stuck out like two 'peeled onions, and when Ralph had gone completely through the vocabulary of blasphemy, Gaff made up his mind that such another avalanch, of oaths would annihilate him, and he exclaimed, as he departed to call his laster, "Look here, young massa, jess you stop dat way of talking; cos you ailit afeared, I don't want de hebens to tumble on dis niggars's head, to be sure!

We must set our face against a sinful ting, dat all. I'll tell you what, young man, you must jess turn right about, or you'll ride rigt into todder world de same way, while de debbel dribe the hoss!" By the time he had finished this speech of premonition, he had reached the baclf stoop of the house, at the door of which he pounded most lustily, at the same time calling out, "Massa Rem! Massa Rem! come quick you can. Here be de Grey come back, and de debble is to pay!"So he kept pound- ing, and so he kept calling, till Remsen, fairly. waked from some pleasant dream of Dutch puddings, slipped on his breeches and hurried to the door. Here, unable to understand anything from the confused manner of the negro, he went himself into the yard, and at once understood the exact position of affairs. "So, so, young man," said he, as he proceeded to release Ralph from his unpleasant dilemma, "this looks as though the tories had been at work with you. But tell us about it. I hope the horse isn't hurt. Gaff, see to him." " guess he is safe enough," said Ralph; " but I at least am none the bet- ter for the ride." In fact you would have thought so; for on his reaching the ground, he was so stiff and sore that he could scarcely stand without the assistance of Rem- sen, who tried his best to console hin. "Ah, well!" he exclaimed, "it is not half so bad as it might be; and though I knew that Grey would always come home without guidance from any distance, still, being at liberty, as it were, it is a wonder that he did not lie down and try to roll you off. It's a hahit of his." ;' Well," said Ralph, as he hobbled along, on the arm of Remsen, toward the house, "that is a comfortable reflection, to be sure. I am obliged to him that he omitted his customary practice on this trying occasion." "Oh, 'tis nothing--'tis nothing, when you get used to it," said Remsen. "Come into the house; I'll call up the vrow, we'll have some hot toddies be- tween us, you can tell all about how it happened, then a little more toddy, then bathe your joints and limbs a little; then a little more toddy again, then two or three hours' rest till morning; then a hot breakfast, and you will be as well as ever, if not, a little more toddy will fix you." These rules and regulations were cheerfully adopted; Ralph told his ad- venture with such spirit, that both Rem and his vrow wondered that he lived to tell the tale; but the story of the strange horseman was omitted, for even when he thought of him, it sent his blood back curdling to his heart." The story was told, the toddies were all drank, rest till full morning, and a refreshing breakfast, and Ralph returned to. New York to pay his respects to Sir Henry Clinton, not much the worse for wear, if we except a stiffness about the loins and hips. Sir Henry received him with much dignity, heard his story through with- out interruption, then tossed him an extra guinea as salve for his wounded honor, muttered something about hanging the " damned rebels," bade him call again in the evening for the package of letters to Butler, and bowed him out of the room with all the ceremony of a lacquey.   REBELS AND   TORIES.          71 The rest of the day was occupied by Ralph in making preparations for his journey; but in every new or unaccountable face that he saw, he imagined that he beheld glaring at liim the fierce eyes of the strange horseman, and his ears continually deceived him into hearing the wild laugh that leaped out of the waters on that dreadful night of crime, or followed him jeeringly on his flight from Flathush to Brooklyn. What damnation greater than a condemning conscience! In taking leave of his aunt, she took good care to impress him with a sense of responsibility in respect to the business upon which he was bent, assuring him, in the most impressive manner, that if he had bound himself as an emis- sary of the British influence, as spy or informer against the interests of the struggling colonists, as sure as heaven had justice, he would come to some untimely and miserable end. Hie heard her through with a deal of patience, and only remarked, as she ceased speaking, that she was "singing her old song again," and wondered " where she had found the morality to preach so much about," and thus they parted. CHAPTER XIV. THE AMBUSH AND THE ATTACK. IT was night. Dark masses of cloud were rolling northward, and the wind, rustling and whistling through the forest, betokened an approaching storm. On a small hillock, cleared of trees, aad within a few rods of the Mohawk, and so situated as to command a view of the river, were encamped a small party of Onondagas. They had kindled a small fire about which they sat; but its glare seemed only to make more palpable the gloom around. The party con- sisted of six warriors, and a partisan, or medicine man. They were decorated with war-paint, and from their appearance, had evidently been out on im- portant duty. That they had been successful, however, might be doubtful, judging by their manner, which indicated disappointment and mistrust. Upon a forked stick was suspended the medicine bag, which upon no occasion was allowed to touch the ground, and to this were the eyes of the six warriors turned with awful reverence, while the partisan had laid down to dream. They who watched had lighted their pipes, which they smoked rather as men who were performing a necessary duty, instead of regaling themselves with a luxury, and occasionally turning the stems of their pipes toward the mysterious medicine bag, then toward the heavens, and toward the earth. Whatever had been the object of their being upon the war-path, something had occurred to puzzle their usual sagacity and cunning; and to the mysterious bag and the dreamer, they now looked for some intimation of success or ill-fortune. There had been no neglect of necessary caution in preparing the medicine previous to their setting out upon their mission. The skin of the sparrow-hawk was prepared with proper charms; the wampum beads were the most approved, and the tobacco wats of the choicest kind. The head of a lizard, had also been  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7034-00000037"/> 72         REBELS AND    TORIES. added: and the dream of the partisan before starting had been'perfectly satis- factory. Presently the dreamer aroused himself, and after making several mystical signs, he approached the medicine bag, and uttered a number of guttural sounds, to which the rest of the party paid the most reverent atten- tion, though they understood not what he said. Turning then toward his companions, he addressed them as follows: "Warriors-The Great Spirit has spoken. lie is angry that we behave so like women, after the loss of our friends last year at Oriskany. The Americans seek to rob us of our lands, and to carry off our squaws and papooses. We are not true to our English friends. lIe promises us many scalps. The Onondagas, the Mohawks, the Cayugas, the Senecas shall have much blood. but the Oneidas have white hearts. "Warriors-We have nothing to say to our nation. Wechave no scalp for the dance; no prisoner for the fire torture. What shall we tell them'? Washemett will be angry, Theyendanega will. laugh at us. We have lost the trail. The fox has lost his cunning. The medicine will not talk; it only says the Great Spirit is angry." There was no other reply to this short speech, other than the customary "Ugh, ugh" of the Indian, though the countenances of all present indicated great anxiety, and occasionally their eyes would peer out into the darkness, as though looking for some one who was every moment expected to emerge within the circle of light thrown out from their fire. There was now Irore than five minutes silence, when of a sudden, and as though struck by an electric flash, every warrior was upon his feet, ready for either friend or foe. A step was approaching, but so cautiously that only the car of an Indian could have detected the footfall; and in a moment more, there issued from the forest, within a few yards of where the little party were encamped, a warrior of a lithe and slender figure, who advanced to their midst, and without speaking threw himself upon the ground, but with due reverence to the medicine bag; then casting a rapid but keen glance to the faces of those present, his eyes rested upon the smouldering brands of the fire, and he waited to be questioned. The partisan spoke first: "Is Pukeesheno the bird that flies? Has he come from the camp of the white chief?"  "Pukeesheno has been in the camp of his enernies, bound like a dog. They placed me where the sun could not look upon me. But Pukeesheno is very cunning. The pale face is a fool." "s Does the young warrior speak? Does the son of a great chief go in the dark?" ' The fire-water of the pale face makes him a child-strong in big words, but his arms are weak. I am here." "It is well., But our eyes ask questions.-Ilas Pukeesheno nothing for our eyes?" At this question the young warrior seemed of a sudden to possess uncom- mon interest to all present, for every eye was turned upon him. ( Let the warriors listen," said Pukeesheno. "Night had fallen, and the eagle was at rest. Only the owl kept company with the moon. I had made   REBELS  AND TORIES.           73 a long journey, and my feet were sore. So I slept-it was like a boy. A party of the pale faces was on my trail, and while I was dreaming of a lodge that I might one day possess, rich with the scalps of the enemy, I was made prisoner and bound, and marched off to the Lower Fort.* But my eyes were 4 good, if the pale faces slept. He was dreaming of his squaw and his papooses, and when he spoke their names, with the long knife of his gun I let out the red stream of his life. See!" And Pukeesheno sprang to his feet, and held before the excited audience a reeking scalp! They might have pealed their shout of triumph at the sight of such welcome evidence of the bravery of the young warrior; but, trained to withhold any boisterous expressions of joy on all occasions where great cau- tion and silence are necessary, there Has no other manifestation of their pleasure than what was exhibited by their gleaming countenances. Replacing his scalp beneath his belt, he reseated himself, and related that since nightfall he had been watching the movements of a party of six who were moving up the river in a 'boat. It consisted of three men and two women. In the early part of the evening they had encamped; and Pukee- sheno stated that he had crept so close to them as to hear what they said. One of the party, he said, was an old man; the two women, his squaw and daughter. These were much exhausted, and desired to repose for the night where they were; while the others, who were bo men, were for going on, as  they thought there would be less probability of a urprise by the Indians on the river than encamping on shore. He said the argument got very warm, and that the boatmen threatened to leave them unless they would consent to go on in the boat. That the old man spoke some words to the Great Spirit, which seemed to do the squaws much good, for they immediately began to return to the boat; that as soon as he saw them off, he struck into the woods, and pushed forward as soon as possible, in hopes of meeting with some of the warriors of his own nation. This news seemed to put life into the savages. They rose to their feet, examined their weapons, and retouched the priming of their guns. The medi- cine man took down his bag from the forked stick, opened its barky envelope, and suspended its contents from his neck, with the bird skin, wampum, and other articles, hanging down on his breast. The fire was now extinguished, and under the direction of the partisan, they began to move on toward the river with cautious steps. When they had approached its banks they sought a covert of bushes, and in this they ambushed, waiting in almost breathless silence for the slightest noise that would indicate the approach of the boat. In. the meantime the party in the boat were moving slowly up the river, the men who were rowing scarcely uttering a word, and even what little they did say was not with an excess of good humor; while the old gentleman and the two females kept up between th nselves, in low whispers, a conversation anything but edifying to the waterman, or consoling to themselves. The youngest of the party was evidently sokovercome with fatigue, that nothing * In 1777, three slight fortifications were built in the Valley of the Sohoharie-kill, called the Upper, Middle, and Lower Forts.  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7034-00000038"/> 74          REBELS  AND  TORIES. but her timidity kept her awake; while. her companion began to despond most wofully. "I don't know how it is, John," said the eldes; of the two females, "I don't know how it is, but I'm dreadfully impressed with something that is about to happen. You may take my word for it, I am afraid we shall all be sorry that we left our quiet home and pleasant associations in the city, for a residence in the wilderness, among half naked savages, wao are ready to spring from behind every tree, armed with a tomahawk and scalping knife." "And say a blunderbuss, my dear," said the old gentleman, quietly. "Mary, I'm astonished that you put so little trust in the protection of that special Providence that watches even over the death of a sparrow! There is Arline, now, I will warrant is not half so untrustful as yourself; and I have known you for thirty years, Mistress M." "But I am none the less frightened," said Arline. "The truth is, sir, that I long most dreadfully to say a great deal-to ask a great many questions, but I have scarcely courage enough to hear my own voice." "Dear me! what is that?" asked Mrs. M. almost at the same time spring- ing off her seat. "What, my dear?" asked Mr. M. a little fluttered himself, if he had been asked to confess the truth. "Why, that-that drejul light in the bushes opposite," said Mrs. M., catching hold of the sleeve of Mr. M.'s coat. "I see no light, my dear," replied Mr. M. wit} most4mperturable gravity. "It's nothing but a jack-o-lantern, Marm," said one of the boatmen. "Don't be for making a fool of yourself before your time is come." "All I've got to say is this, gentlemen and lad es," said the other boatman; if you don't all on ye talk less and see sharper, we shall have them bloody Ingins down on us in less than a jiffy." This speech had the effect to impress silence on the group for the ensuing' five minutes, and the next person to speak was the boatman again, who, casting an inquiring glance toward the shore, said: a "Well, now, as you are all pretty well fagged out, and I don't feel none of the freshest myself, I don't know but we may venture ashore here. I guess we're above the haunts of the Ingins now-leastways I don't think but what we may try it, for the river runs strong here, ar d it aint none of the easiest work in the world, rowing a boat against the stream when a bodg's almost ready to drop down with fatigue. Come, Bill, pull ashore. I see a good place to camp. I know the ground, every inch on it; and I never seen an Ingin on it yet." "How glad I am," said Mrs. M., as she saw the boat head for the shore. "If we are to meet with danger, I'd rather it wo ild come on dry land than on water. Arline, my dear, pull your cloak closer around you. I'm afraid you'll catch cold. My love," she continued, addressing her husband, "don't you think now, we shall be more comfortable and full as safe on shore? But after all, though, this is not our old home in the city." ' Mrs. M., our destiny is in the hands of a Power whose wisdom is far-see- ing; and I dare say, that whatever fate happens to us, it is not without His   REBELS   AND  TORIES.           75 ken; so we will not repine, and look back to comforts which we lhave aban- doned. Not for selfish ends, I trust, did we venture into this wild country. We should not allow our faith'to falter for an instant." By this time the prow of the boat had touched the shore, and springing out, the boatmien assisted the passengers from it, and commenced removing the, baggage.' The place they had selected for their encampment was a short stretch of interval on the northern side of the Mohawk, in the centre of which stood the ruins of'a log-hut. Where they landed, the shore was quite shallow, with clumps of bushes growing hither and thither, into one of which, after taking out its contents, they dragged their boat. This accomIplished, the boat- men led the way to the old log house, which they found more tenantable than they had expected. In one apartment, more sheltered than the rest, they found ma fire-place, in which they soon had a comfortable blaze, while they spread their blankets on the floor and arranged themselves for repose; not, however, until Mr. Monroe had returned thanks for the safety with which they had thus far pursued their journey, and solicited s continuance of the Divine protection till their arrival at the place of their d stination, which they hoped to reach the ensuing day. The two boatmen, more used to adventures  this kind than their com- panions, were soon insensible to all outward danger; while, in his implicit trust in Providence, Mr. Monroe soon followed teir example; nor could all the timidity of Arline long keep her eyes open, so completely worn out was she by fatigue: besides, seeing the others sleep so confident of safety, she seemed to catch a portion of their assurance, and was soon as unconscious as either of them. Only Mrs. Monroe could not sleep. Every breath of wind startled her, and every shadow in the room was magnifiedand horrified into an Indian. Several times she made a resolution that she would sleep, and as often would she start' up so alarmed that she was ion the point of calling out to her husband. At length, however, fairly beaten out. and her nerves re- fusing any longer to be trifled with, she fell off irito a very quiet sleep, and was soon back in New York, among her old riends again. Before lying down, however, the boatmen had taken the precaution to secure the only. en- trance to the log house; and against the door of the room in which they had taken up their quarters, they piled the baggage of the travellers. They were also cautious in examining the priming of their guns, and placing them in such positions by their sides as to control them at an instant's warning. As for either of the party standing sentinel while the rest slept, it was quite unneces- sary. If surprised by a foe, in any case, their only chance would be in re- sistance; and the noise made by an assailing party in effecting an entrance, would alarm them full as effectually as would a sentinel, whose notice of dan- ger could scarely be given before the attack was commenced. By this time it begai to lighten up a little in the cast, and the first faint blush of day made itself visible over the top of the forest. In the neighbor- hood of the hut nothing of life was perceptible, and, save the wind, the only sound heard was the bark of a fox in the edge of an adjacent thicket. Short- ly afterward the rain began to fall in large drops, and occasionally a burst of thunder awoke the surrounding echoes, and rumbling along the hills, died  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7034-00000039"/> *76  ^      REBELS AND TORIES. away in the distance. A dusky figure now emerged from the wood, and crept cautiously out into the plain; then came another, and another, until the number amounted to eight. They continued advancing till within a hun- dred rods of the hut, where they paused, and seemed to be holding a consult ation. Then one of the party separated from the rest, and at a sort of a do- trot, made a circle toward the river in the rear of the hut and in the direction of the thicket in, which lay the boat from which the occupants of the log cabin had landed but a short time before. The remain ng seven divided themselves into two parties, and began to approach the solitary tenement, which seemed to be the sole object of interest to them. Being satisfied as they neared it thafithey were unsuspected by those within, they threw aside most of their caution, and advanced at once to the door, whicL they examited attentively, and being satisfied that it; was secured within, they next directed their atten- tion to the roof of the house, and then to the di'ferent sides, as though con- sulting upon the most feasible plan of attack. They then waited the return of him who had gone toward the river; and as soon as he had rejoined his companions, a kind of war council was held for five ininutes, when all but Pukeesheno retired. Pukeesheno then listened a moment to assure himself that all was quiet, and approaching the door, lie gave three very distinct knocks. One of the inmates at least heard the summons, for a voice within was heard to utter, in tonesalmost of agony: M' Mr. Monroe, wake up! The Indians have come. We shall all be killed I Oh dear! oh dear!" vI This appeal of his good wife did of a verity alarm the worthy Dominie, for he sprang to his feet as quickly as his dignity would allow. Arline trembled like a hare, and the two boatmen grasped their Weapons, ready for the emergency, be it what it might. The knocking not being repeated immediately, Mrs. M. was in a fair way to get laughed at for her fright. "I hear nothing, my dear," said Mr. Monroe. "I think you must have been dreaming*" "I am sure you are mistaken, doctor," replied Mrs. Mh, rather piqued to think that he supposed she did not know real knocking from a dream. "' I am ffi   sure I heard three distinct knocks, as sure as I'm a woman.'" ' I guess, marin, it was something else you heard," said one of the boatmen, showing some inclination to finish out his slumbers. Thus the alarm partially subsided, and Mrs. Monroe herself began to think that her fancy might have cheated her, when the dispute was most peremp- tolily settled by three more knocks loud enough for the'hl to hear. Al- though Mrs. Monroe had no particular courage to boast of, still, when she heard the second challenge, she could not help exclaiming with an air of triumph: "Didn't 1 tell you so. Will you believe me now?'7 The boatmen now betook themselves to their arms in earnest, nor was the worthy Mr. Monroe without the proper weapon of defence, being advised of its necessity before leaving the city. The females were much alarmed, and fled to a corner of the room, clinging to each other. as it were, for protection. tule of the boatmen now approached the ioor, and demanded the c'ause of   REBELS A'D     TORIES.          " intrusion. This at first elicited no other reply than a repetition of the knock- ing. He then threatened to fire through the door unless answered, when a voice without exclaimed - ;' Tt st6rms-I am cold-shelter.'" ' A dcainn Ingin, and no mistake. Bill, what shall we do?" addressing his companion. "Fire, of course!" said Bill. "Ay, and have the pack of devils upon us at once. What do you say, Dominie?" If they are Indians," said he, "'* might we not hold a parley with them?" "Would you hold a parley with Satan?"' "' Assuredly not," replied Mr. Monroe, with gravity. "But Satan, my dear sir--" :' Nor I with a wild Ingin," replied the other with impatience. ' But there is only one," said Mr. Monroe; "and surely we may not be afiraid of a single man." ' There are motle than I want to see, at an'y rate," saiA the boatman; "and they are not here for any good purpose, depend upon it." The knocking now became quite violent, and the boatman thought he dc- tccted some movement that indicated thie presence of a party. At the best there was no chance for flight. If the Indians were upon them, their only alternative was in fighting; and though the possibility of escape might prove but small, it was concluded at least to sell their lives as dearly as they could. Looking round the apartment, therefore, a loophole was discovered, from which they could discern three of the Indians under the shelter of a tree, but a few feet from the 'house. Bill was stationed at this post, while his com- panion once more challenged him who knocked at the door. "Are you a friend or an enemy?" he inquired. "-A friend," replied he without. "A friend to whom?" askcd the boatman. ; The white brother," was the answer. "Are you alone?" Yes. The rain falls. I am cold." ' Onondaga or Oneida?" ; Oneida." "You lie, you bltck wlhelp-you copper-head." k' Does my white brother doubt? Let him see." '; Look here, you pisen sarpent!" said the boatman; ;; if you aint off in no time, I'll send you to tophet. We are strong enough here to kill forty of you, so be off." Bill now communicated to lim that lie saw six Indians approaching from a covert of young trees near by, and from their appearance, he had no doubt of their being enemies. "I tell you Ramsayj" said he, " we shal have hot work unless we begin soon, for the red devils are intent upon ichief, as any one may see."  Then we must kill as many of them as we can," said Ranmsa y. Dominie, can you shoot your man?"  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7034-00000040"/> 78          REBELS AND TORIES. In a desperate case like this, I know not what I could do. For my own life it is not of so much consequence but if I can assist in preserving the lives of others, I may do so without sin. If it is necessary, I can try my skill." ' Ah," said Bill, " they are bringing brush from the wood. They intend to fire the building. A hard job, I should think, in this rain." "Never mind the rain,' said Ramsay; " they will find a way to do it if they wish. But pick out your man and fire." "Here goes, then," said Bill, as with careful aim he fired from the loop- hole." What was the success of the shot he could not tell, but it was followed by a war-whoop so terrific that the women screamed with afright. A rush was now made against the door, which nearly burst it in,'when Ramsay discharged his piece through a crevice in the timber, and the attack and repulse became general. As fast as they could load their pieces they were discharged from the inside, but with what effect was not apparent, the Dominie doing good duty, and the ladies behaving quite respectably. The brushwood had been placed against the house, and attempts made in various places to light it; but it was too wet to ignite rapidly, and the gusts of wind extinguished it as fast as a blaze made its appearance. The assailants were finally obliged to relinquish the attempt to fire the hut; but their rage at this disappointment only stimulated them to renewed exertions against the door. The attack was now made with large stones, which soon caused the hinges and fastenings to start; and, although a very active fire was kept up from within, still its effect was limited. Mr. Monroe behaved as bravely as either of the boatmen, and although not so quick in his motions, he enacted deeds that would have done credit to a more experienced backwoodsman Then the women had to be consoled; for Mrs. M. had nearly gone into hysterics at the commencement of the attack, and it required all the fortitude of poor Arline, who, on this trying occasion of peril, evinced the courage of a heroine. The boatmen grew terribly excited, and in the heat of the assault, Ramsay ex- claimed with the wildness of a madman: "We had better open the door and make a rush upon the red devils at once. This fighting penned up here, like a chained tiger, is poor fun! Open and sally! open and sally!" "True; it is our only chance, Ramsay," said Bill, once more discharging his piece. The savage yells that followed this, convinced him that the shot had told fearfully upon the person of one of the assailants at least, and a united effort was once more made against the door, which took effect so far that one of the savages came rolling in upon the floor, and he was soon dispatched with the breech of Bill's gun and a ball from that of Ramsay. It was now evident that the contest must soon be terminated. The impetuosity of Ramsay led him to dash out through the breach made by the savages into the midst of them. he was instantly surrounded, and fighting with fearful odds. Bill seeing the jeopardy of his companion, rushed to his rescue, while, at the same time two of the savatges sprang into the house, seized and bound Mr. Monroe and the two women, whom they led out in time for them to witness the in-   REBELS AND   TORIES.           79 iuman butchery of the boatmen, and see their reeking scalps torn from their heads. The house was soon in a blaze, and without allowing their captives to %secure any part of their clothing from the baggage, they were marched off to the forest, their ferocious captors taking with them two of their compan- ions, who were so severely wounded as to be unable to walk, and the body of him who had been killed at the bursting of the door. By this time it had become quite light, and the storm had set in with good earnest. CHAPTER XV. THE RESCUE. ABOUT a year previous to the events in the preceding chapter, a detachment of Morgan's celebrated riflemen, Captain Long, arrived in Schoharic. These, and a regiment of Pennsylvania militia, were under the command of Lieuten- ant Colonel William Butler, an officer highly esteemed by Washington, and thought particularly qualified for the service upon which he was ordered. The rifle corps of Captain Long was composed of bold and adventurous spirits, many of whom signalized themselves by the daring exploits they performed. Among the number was a man of the name of Murphy, a Virginian, who, as the term of his enlistment soon expired, concluded to carry on a war on his own account; and as he was noted for fleetness, almost superhuman pourage, and great precision in firing, many are the thrilling adventures tlhat to this day are told of him, by persons who reside in the immediate vicinity of his exploits. His favorite weapon was a double-barreled rifle; and by his being able to fire this twice in succession, the Indians believed that it was charmed. He frequently ventured into the forest alone, fought the Indians after their own fashion, and when obliged to, resort to flight, his heels were more than a match for them. The more apparent the danger, the greater in proportion would be his courage-sometimes attacking a whole party at once, and not unfrequently, in imitation of his more savage foe, would he resort to the in.. human practice of scalping. It was said of him at the close of the war, that he had killed over forty of their warriors with his own hand. This may be considered very probable, as his courage was indomitable, and the aim of his rifle hnerring. This little introduction to this chapter is thought necessary to preface some of the events which we are now to relate. The night following that in which the onslaught was made upon the log cabin, two men were busily engaged in the denseness of the forest, in making a scanty suppei from some fragments of venison which they were roasting upon a stick over a fire built in the shelter of a large rock, and against which they had placed young saplings and brushwood to protect them from the drizzling rain, for the storm still continued. Both of them were well armed-- with rifles, and long knives stuck in their belts, and one of them carried a tomahawk whose keen edge glistened by the light of the fire. One of the  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7034-00000041"/> 86          REBELSAND TORIES. party was a stout square-built man, muscular and vigorous as a tiger-active and sprightly as a cat. He was garmented in leggings of deerskin, his feet encased in Indian moccasins, and over these he wore a rifleman's coat, per- haps none the better for its intimacy with trees and bushes. His head was covered with a cap made from the skin of a catamount, which he himself had killed, from under which gleamed a pair of restless, watchful grey eyes. As uncouth and rough, however, as was his outward appearance, a person at all studied in physiognomy might detect in the strong earnest manliness of his face, the faithful index of a kind and trui heart. His companion was some years his senior, of a light figure, lithe and wiry limbs; his arms almost flesh- less, but muscular; a face in which every passion was traced with the pencil of an artist; eyes, black and piercing; mouth, compressed and revengeful, unshaven and unshorn, and yet with a countenance in which none of the meaner passions could be traced. He appeared like one who had suffered dreadfully, but whose wrongs or misfortunes never passed the portals of his lips. In fact he was a singular compound-for the most part wild and furious, particularly in his displays of passion; yet at times, and in emergencies re- quiring great caution, he became as reserved and cautious as the most skillful plotter. It was evident that some calamity had shattered the seat of his reason; yet to all with whom he came in contact, the cause remained a mystery. "Well, Wild Medicine," said the younger of the two, stirring the brands of the fire with the end of his knife, and apparently well satisfied with the flavor of the venison, "Well, Wild Medicine, what do you think of the weather? Is this infernal drizzle to continue a month or not. You are weatherwise, and should know. Call you this decent weather for August?" "So (do the owl and the bat. What is that to me? Cold or hot, rain or shine, it is nothing to me. Ask the owl and the bat." "Well," said the first speaker, "I might, for all I am likely to learn from you. the evil fit is on you again to-night. Come, our meat is done, help yourself. I only wish there was more of it. But to make up for what is wanting suppose we take a drop of this?" And the speaker produced a small canteen from the Rocket of his coat, and -after taking a comfortable "swig," as he called it, ile assed it to his com- panion, who, whatever might be his eccentricities, did not hesitate to follow the example of the other. Though their repast was not as princely as many a man gets at the present day, it need not be denied that it a;s enjoyed with a better relish than many a luxurious meal of the bon vivant. And when they had eaten the last morsel, and picked clean every bone, they began to think of preparing some sort of resting-place for the night. "And so, Wild Medicine," said the other, gathering twigs and brush, with which he was forming a bed to keep them from the wet ground, "you think your white brother is as great a savage as these infernal red skins that I spend my time in hunting and shooting? A pretty sort of a Christian you must be, to be sure!" ,                          v "You are L fool!" replied Wild Medicine. Come, come, none o' that, you imp of mystery. I never allows a man to   REBELS AND TORIEs.             81 call me that in earnest, without a settlement; and I shouldn't like you and me to quarrel." "You are a fool! You can't tell which way the wind blows, nor catch the scent of an Indian," said Wild Medicine, examining his weapons. "I'm a match for them when I see them, at any rate, if I can't scent them; and as for your infernal winds here in the north, I don't know who could keep the run of them more than an hour at a time.. Eh! what is that? Riddle me if I didn't hear the voice of a woman." The Wild Medicine stepped out a little from the shelter. and listening a mo- ment, returned, and throwing himself down upon his bed of brush, merely answered that the wind was singing a requiem for the souls of the dead Indians. "Ah, that won't do. You can never make me believe that an Ingin has a soul more than any other brute. Try again, Wild Medicine, before you sleep on it." '   Ha! ha! sleep! When did I sleep last?-Let me see-many years ago, when I was    Hark!" In an instant both men were on their feet, grasping their weapons, for now they could distinctly hear the moaning of a woman's voice, and presently the sound of approaching footsteps. "Hush!" whispered the Wild Medicine at once throwing aside his assumed character;' "there's the tread of the moccasin; but he comes not alone!" C "A war party, belike," said the other, returning from a murdering expe- dition, with prisoners. Now,ow T omm1  ," lie continued, handling his rifle affectionately, " here comes brave work for you that will make your old soul joyous. 'Tis lucky the fire is entirely out. We must leave this place, and get upon their trail, for they must soon encamp for the night." "You are right, Murphy. We must give up all thoughts of repose for to- night; for if these be Indians with prisoners, we must manage some way to render assistance." And kill the red devils themselves," said Murphy. "Come, you are more acquainted With these forests than myself, though I don't often back down to any one. Lead off here to the right a little, till they pass, and then we will follow them. I hope they wont discover that any one has been here, else it might alarm them, and we should be put to more trouble in surprising them." "They seem to be passing several rods to the right, they will go on toward the Scoharie kill. Let us fall down a little, and keep within hearing distance, with a footfall as light as a feather." This arrangement was adopted, and the two men were soon enabled to strike the trail of the other party, who were progressing somewhat slowly, in consequence of the fatigue of their prisoners. At one time they were near enough to ascertain that the Indians were consulting about dispatching one of their victims, a woman, in consequence of her inability to proceed as fast as they desired.

In this way they continued on for two hours longer, evidently deter- - mined on reaching as near their destinati( before stopping, as possible.

It was thought best to rest a while, to give the other party time to encamp, and then trust to fortune for an opportunity of surprising them. "It requires the patience of Job to hunt the critters," said Murphy, as he leaned against the sheltered side of a tree. ' How's your powder, Wild Medicines-" "All fight and dry," was the answer. "And your flint?-is it sure? "As death! Am I a boy?" "Worse than a boy, Medicine-worse than a boy. I would rather meet a regiment of them, than you alone, when the evil spirit is in you." "And you are no insignificant enemy, Murphy,'" said the other, " as the tory, Service, could answer for, were he able to speak." ("That was not my arm, Medicine. True, he would have -cloven my head with an axe, but the bullet of one of our riflemen sent him howling to his master, the devil, where all tories will go, I am sure, in the end. There is one other I should like monstrously to meet sometime when I have the change to settle with him." "And who is he?" asked the Wild Medicine. "Leffers X" s  "Never?' exclaimed the Wild Medicine with emotion, and so loudly that Murphy became alarmed lest their voices shoald be heard by the Indians. it Not so loud-we shall alarm the red-skins," said Murphy in a whisper. "Why not Leffers, Wild Medicine?" "He is mine!" he replied, with a fearful hiss; (" and woe be to him who robs me of him! He is mine! By night and by day, for more than twenty years have I watched him; and I would have protected him at the hazard of my own life!" By this time the reader will have recognised, in the ' Wild Medicine," his old acquaintance, Upton. . In vain did Murphy try to get from his companion his reasons for such fu- rious hatred of Leffers, which he saw arose from personal, not political, mo- tives. He could elicit nothing from him beyond the fact of his enmity, and his determination to watch over him, and preserve him for a victim peculiarly his own. "Sometime or other," said the Wild Medicine-for so we must continue to call him--" when he and I are quits-when his accounts are settled, and when, perhas, I am myself at rest with the world!--you may know all. God save me! That a life I have led! But you would have done it-you-I know you would!" "Done what?" asked Murphy. "All that I have done-all that I must do { for I have sworn to do it. I. an't help it-it is a dreadful task-but there are my wrongs-there is my oath! I know it will be, and then I shall sleep!" The conversation was now dropt, and the two men waited with patience for the moment when they would consider it safe to move. They were confident   REBELS AND    TORIES.           3 that the Indians were encampcd not far from them, and after waiting over an hour, they continued to advance with slow and cautious steps, and so noise- lessly that not the smallest twig broke beneath their feet. After proceeding about one hundred rods, Murphy fancied he could hear the deep breathing of persons who slept. This convinced them that they were almost upon the party, and it was now deemed advisable to reconnoitre a little. In another moment they came in sight of a small fire, around which they could count the forms of seven sleeping Indians, and near by a group of three captives, On old man and two women. bound hand and foot, the former of whom was asleep, his head resting upon the lap of one of the women. The Wild Mcedicine, being the lightest of foot: approached near enough to ascertain that the Indians, be- lieving their captives securely bound, were slumbering unconscious of the vicin- ity of a foe. The next step to be taken was to make themselves known to the prisoners in such a manner as not to alarm them, and thus awake their captors. The Wild Medicine instantly conceived that if he could first attract the notice of one of the females, whom he observed to be the youngest, she could communicate with the others, and thus save confuision and noise which might be fatal to their project. Watching an opportunity when the faice of the other female was bent down,to thai of the man whose head lay in her lap, he made a sign which fortunately attracted the attention of the other, and happily without startlifng her. It was not difficult to make her understalnd his object, and she at once whispered in the ear of the other, then the old gentleman was awakened, and the Wild Medicine had the satisfaction of see- ing everything thus far work well. Beckoning now to Murphy, the latter crept stealthily forward, till both, with ready weapons, stood over the sleeping foe. Not an instant was to be lost. Their guns were removed, and Murphy, bend- ing over the prostrate form of a herculean savage, with a strong arm drove the broad blade of his knife into the heart of his victim, who scarcely groaned, ere another shared the same fate, and by the same hand. In the mean time the tomahawk of the Wild Medicine had done execution upon a third and a  fourth, when the others, alarmed, sprang up, two of whom fled in dismay, not however till the crack of Murphy's rifle sped a messenger after themn that brought one of them to the ground, who was soon dispatched, while the other succeeded in escaping. Tte remaining Indl n having been previously serious- ly wounded. was unable to resist or fly, an s the blood of Murphy was' up, the fate of the unfortunate creature was sealed by a blow over the lhead with the breech of his rifle. Thus a terrible retribution followed the actors in the previous night's massacre. It would be superfluous to describe the joy of the prisoners at their deliv- erance, and the many thanks tendered the brave men who had so opportunely come to their rescue. Mr. Monroe returned thanks for their wonderful es- cape; and Mrs. 3I. declared that, had she dreamed of such horrors, she never would have left the city for the wilderness; while Arlinc, with toarful eyes, felt more than her full heart could express. It was now thought best to remove from the scene of the struggle; and in a short time they were comfortably encamped on a knoll, protected from the Neather LXy a ,hleltcr of bushes, and with a' cheerfidl blae, the late ca ltives  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7034-00000043"/> 84          REBELS AND   TORIES. were so6n in a condition to enjoy that repose which their recent fatigue and anxiety promised to guarantee them. Murphy and his companion closed not their eyes for the rest of the night, but stood as faithful sentinels till the break of dawn heralded another day; and hearing in mind the harassing events of the few past hours, it would have been a study for a painter to behold with what confidence that fair maiden slept beneath the watchful guardianship of her preserver, and with what in- terest he at times peered into her face, lit up by the cheerfll blaze of the fire, attracted thither by some vague murmur of a dream, whose ghosts, at times flitted through the dim chambers of the brain. CIAPTER XVI. PARTING AND MEETING. "EFrrES, being now fully engaged in marauding parties of tories and In- dians, throughout the entire Mohawk Valley, concluded, as soon as-possible, to send his wife and remaining child to some place of safety, till the war was ended, and he should be able to resume: unmolested, his residence in the vicinity of Schoharic. As cautiously as he had managed his affairs, he had become sufficiently notorious to render it unsafe for him to havgeny settled 'habitation. More than once he had narrowly escaped with life from the pur- suit of those who sought opportunities for proceeding in a summary manner against one whom they believed often acted in the capacity, of an informer. On one occasion he had enlisted in the Continental army, where he performed the part of a spy, using also his influence to corrupt what Trishmen he could find among the Americans. He was suspected, and a watchl put upon his movements. Finally it was concluded to arrest him; but ere an order was procured for that purpose from Colonel Ganscvdort, then in command at Fort Schuyler. le managed to escape; and from that time. his principles being in- derstood, hu found it expedient for his safety to consort almost exclusively with tories and Indians. Having determined on removing his family, his next consideration was as to the means, and in what direction. His fiist thought was toward New York, and in this direction he would probably have sent themn had not an incident occurred which for boldness and audacity stands almost without a parallel. A few days previous to the events of the preceding chapter, a party of loy- alists, numbering more than one hundred, who had two years previously fled to Canada with Sir John Johnson, made their appearance in Tyron County, collected their families, and departed without let or hindrance from the whigs. With these Leffers determined to send his wife and child, and accompanied them himself as far as Sir William Johnson's, on the Sacondaga. In Canada lie knew they would be out of the power of his enemies-and. he hoped, beyond the reach of that unrelenting foe, whose persecution for so many years had not tailed to n:ake itself felt. But this party were not satisfied with having )   REBELS AND TORIES.           J    85 collected their families. On ther way through the country to tli Sacoldaga, where they took canoes, they committed all sorts of outrages-bu ning houses, robbing the people and making them prisoners. But there was an eye that watched all their movements-a foot that followed them many a mile upon their progress. One night, when the tories had encamped, making an excellent supper from provisions which in the course of the day they had plundered from a farm- house, Leffers wrapped himself in his blanket for the purpose of snatcling a few moments repose. How long he slept he could not tell, but sometime during the night be felt a rude hand upon his shouldicr, and started, as one does from a frighltful dream. lIe was about to cry out, but a sharp whisper bade him, as his life was dear. not to utter a word, whle ild and haggard form that bent over him, seemed magnifild in his eyes to a giant, and a voice '"'tissed in his ear:  "Sleep, Nihumi Lctfters! Dream; thou drowsy wretch! ost thi n 1 can- no? reach thee? I would find you out were the huge ocean to swallow youl!  Can you hide those you love from the coil' of the serpent? Ah , wrctch, that a poor man should owe you twenty pounds! Jew! woulIld youI have leshl and blood for your bond? No, no! bloodless flesh will do! Take security of the dead! What right have the poor to bury their dead? Go! send tlhem away! hide them in caverns! top them with mountains,! the eye of the searcher shall find them! Sleep! )ream! Die! and go where yoqr spirit shall crisp and wither like a scrQll-where hot agony shall make you l'rithe like a wounded reptile! There shall be no mercy for you, Nahunm lflelrs!- None!-none! Eternal! ha! lha! Sleep! dream! I)ie! l]but flr ever! for ever! lHa! ha!" As these last words were spoken, Leffers uttered a shriek, called fir aid:l and alarmed the guard, who had slept upon his post. The entire camp was in motion in an instant; and the women. thinking that they were surprised by an enemy, ran hither and thither in search of their husbands. Scouts were sent out, but no capture was made-no enemy had been seen; and Leffers only got abuse for creating such a disturbance by it foolish dream; and few could be made to believe that he had been attackek by anything mole sub- stantial. The next day he separated from the party to return, and the parting from his wife and child was affecting in the extreme. She wept bitterly, used all the eloquence she was possessed of to induce him to go on with them, and even threatened not to proceed at all without him; while his daughter clung fondly around his neck, and with all the bewitching tenderness of chillhood, used every endearment of speech that she could think of to persuade lher father not to leave them. But in vain. He remained immovable in his de- termination, as though influenced by an irrevocable destiny, the power of which no effort of the human mind could destroy. So they parted. The wife was taken from him in a swoon and his daughter in an agony of tears, while he went forth into the forest alone to retrace his steps to the neighborhood of Schoharie. It surely was destiny that impelled him. Else why go forth alone tl;iOn a  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7034-00000044"/> 8(5         REBELS   AND  TORIES. path which at any moment was liable to be crossed by his most desperate and dreadful enemy? He was not a coward, but the thought of his visitor of the previous night quickened the beat of his pulse; and as he entered the dense- ness of the forest, and his late companions were no longer in sight nor within hearing, he thought it prudent to examine the lock of his gun, assure himself that his other weapons were in order, and tighten the belt around his waist. But with the strong heart of a man, though a bad one, he pushed on through the forest, fording creeks, wading swamps, till two hours, past midday, when, pressed by hunger, he thought of looking about him for something in the shape of game. He felt somewhat doubtful of the propriety of discharging his gun, thus alone in the forest, as its report might bring to his vicinity unwel- come visitors. But hunger is a most unreasonable beggar, whose demands are governed by no particular rules or usages, and after looking in vain for game of the forest or bird of the air, for more than half an hour, he chanced, by good or evil fortune, to frighted a partridge from its nest, which he shot, and this, together with two fresh eggs, he thought might answer very well as a dinner to a man not over dainty in his appetite. His next movement was to make arrangements for cooking his food, and for this purpose he selected a hollow tree in which he kindled a fire, and in a few minutes the partridge was roasting over a nice bed of coals. While the cooking was going forward he had ample time for reflection; and his past life, as he reviewed it, appeared to him filled with one continual catalogue of upbraiding hours. Surrounded, as he had been for years, with perils, his life many times in danger, escaping with the utmost difficulty, and at the eleventh hour, he wondered that he could still be alive to plot new villanies and encounter fresh dangers. One thing at least seemed to give him satisfaction, and that was the removal of his family beyond the influence of that savage and partizan warfare, which bade fair to be as disastrous to many an other section of the country, as it seemed likely to prove to the Valley of the Mohawk. lie regretted ever having brought his wife from her first quiet home in the city, he shuddered as he thought of the fate of his two children-whether dead or in the hands of the savages, he knew not; though in the latter case, from his frequent interviews with the Indians, lie doubted not but ere this he would have found some clue to their discovery. But when his mind turned upon the arch enemy of his existence, imagination failed to supply him any speculations as to the destiny of the boys. Now, hower, he was a free man again-untrammeled by the claims which others had upon his protection. In this particular he was a match for his enemy, having no place of habitation, and free as the winds to fly or pursue as circumstances might require. If the measure of revenge was not yet full, at least it could- not reach him through the destruction of others whose existenrce was as dear to him as his own. On his head alone must the blow fall, and the innocent at least would be spared the infliction of a curse which had clung to him for so many years. Wretch as he was. he possessed affections that twined around his heart, often prompting it to better impulses. As he watched the progress of his cooking, he almost came to the resolu- tion of seeking out the foe that had so long pursued him.; and either by stra- ta:nen. or personal encounter, end at once the dreaf'ulf suspense of his fate.   REBELS AND    TORIES.           87 But then again he was superstitious, and sometimes he beliecd there was no flying from the persecution-that he was doomed to certain tortne, and that flight or evasion would not save him. All these thoughts sped through his brain in the course of a few moments; for, surely, situations of peril have a magician's power to conjure up, and crowd into the space of an instant, the actions of a whole life. Then how watchful should we be of oursclves, that, when the dark hour comes, we can close our eyes witlhout a shudder-move through the world and out of 'it, without the burden of a bad act to sink us into perdition. Leffers had well nigh finished his repast, when, on looking around, he saw standing before him, and almost directly over him, an Indian warrior. Leffers sprang to his feet, and seizing his gun, stood prepared for his defence should the other show any symptoms of hostility. But the savage remained im- movable, with his small piercing eyes fixed on the countenance of the man before him as though he would read each thought and passion struggling within him. The Indian was past the middle age of man, tall and erect, but with a face scarred and bruised with many a desperate conflict,.though par- tially concealed by the hideous costume of war-paint by which it was deco- rated. At length, apparently satisfied with his examination, the savage spoke:- "Has not my white brother been in the lodges of the Onondaga?" Leffers replied in the affirmative. "Won he not the love of the Young Fawn, when the great light had gone down, and with the white man's lie made her turn her feet from the lodges of her people?" "No," said Leffers, assuming an indifference he did not feel. "My red brother is on the wrong trail. His eyes are no longer young. "The tongue of the trader is a forked tongue," said the warrior with inef- fable scorn. "The white manl is a snake. Itas he forgotten the stake? Knows he no more his white medicine brother?" "My red brother is thirsty-his throat is dry. I cannot understand what he speaks. Drink." Saying this, and with the hope of an evasion, Leffers handed to the Indian a small bottle, containing spirits, thinking through the usual partiality of the red man for fire-water, his troublesome visitor would drink, and thus forget the subject he was so unpleasantly broaching.  But he was mistaken. Though the Indian took the bottle, he hurled it the next instant against a rock, crushing it to atoms, while the demon which it encased being set at liberty, mingled with the elements of air, earth, and water. The old spirit of Leffers came over him as lie saw this act of the Indian, and had he believed that he could have been quick enough for the deed, he would have shot him where lie stood, and thus destroyed one whom he hLad reason to suspect as an enemy. But his foe, if such he were, gave him no opportunity for this ad- vantage; for keeping a wary eye upon Leffers, he held his own unerring piece so as to use it at the slightest gesture on the part of the latter that might seem to jeopardize his safety. i: Dog of a palc tace!:' xclnimedl the Indian. "Come youl from the bad  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7034-00000045"/> 88          REBELS  AND  TORIES. Manitou to poison and destroy the red man? Thief of night! Will you tell a chief of the Onondaga that his eyes are blind with age. Wasshemett is like the eagle. The great sun has not made his eyes dim." "Wasshemett knows that I am the friend of the red man. We both fight the same enemy. We will not shed the blood of friends while the rebel breeds like the small fly in the swamp. Let us smoke." "Wasshemett knows that the white man has two tongues. He speaks bad words of his brother. He is a traitor. Wasshemett will not be friends with such. The Great Spirit would be angry,"  - .. . "What does my red brother want?" asked Lefiersin, a voice that indicated some anxiety for his safety. "He would see the pale face in his lodges. The war-cry is up. It is pleas- ant to our old men and our women to see their braves return-from the war- path with many scalps. It makes the spirit of departed warriors glad, in the happy hunting grounds of the good Manitou." "( y red brother speaks in a strange tongue," said Leffers, willing to spend time by any expedient. "Will Wasshemett speak the words of his heart? What would a chief of the Onondaga say?" "Look at me," said Wasshemett. "Scalps and prisoners are a pleasant sight in the villages of our people. We have many; but the pale faces are like the leaves in the forest-there be no end to them; they already out- number the red man, and would drive him from the burial places of his fathers. We must have many prisoners-many scalps, for the bones of our young men lie unburied, and their spirits will not rest!" Leffers put his hand to the trigger of his gun, as he raised it from the ground; but the eye of the Indian was too quick for him; for with unerring precision he hurled his tomahawk with such force that the piece was dashed, to the earth, causing it to be discharged, at the same time springing forward, with one foot upon it. he presented his own gun at the breast of Leffers, as he exclaimed: "The pale face is a fool! It is well that he has met Wasshemett. Another warrior would have had his scalp. He must go to to the lodge of Wasshe- mett." And as he said this he uttered a low war-cry, or whoop, and instantly Leffers was surrounded by a dozen savage-looking warriors, who seized him andpnioned his arms with thongs. The first impulse of Leffers, as his gun wps stricken from him, was to close in upon the savage, and by a desperate struggle terminate the scene at once. Though nearly fifty years of age, he was still strong and muscular, and would have proved no unequal match for his opponent. But Wasshemett had divined his purpose, and gave the signal in time to prevent a contest as uncertain as it would have been bloody. True, he might easily have dispatched him; but this it was his desire to avoid if possible, as the taking a prisoner is reckoned a higher honor than the taking of a scalp. Finding that resistance was useless, and that escape was at present out of the question, Leffers concluded to submit in silence to his fate, and in a few minutes more the whole party moved off in the direction of Lake Pleasant.   REBELS  AND  TORIES.  CHAPTER XVI. THE FIRST DAWN OF LOVE. THE gratitude which the clergyman, his wife and Arline felt toward the brave men who had so speedily and effectually rescued them from the power of their merciless captors, was of that warmth which language cannot easily express. Mr. Monroe, after returning thanks to that High Power which had seen proper to deliver them from such inminent peril, extended his hands to Murphy and -Billy, and while he cordially grasped theirs, the thankfulness of his heart was eloquently expressed in the tears that trembled in his eyes; while his good lady, more fluent i speech, poured forth eulogy upon eulogy in praise of the manful act, and in thanks to the gallant hearts that performed it. But Arline-what could she say? Why, she sat quietly apart from the rest, and though she could think of no method of expressing her gratitude, the very manner of her confusion pleased her deliverers more than words--at least so thought Murphy, who, possessing a fine figure, and a pleasant and intelligent countenance, was by no means unwilling to believe that his attrac- tions were sufficient to make an impression upon the mind of Arline. Up to the present moment his heart had not been touched by the flame of Eros; nor, in sooth, had he ever had the leisure to give the subject a moment's con- sideration, so busy had he been since the war broke out. Perhaps he had never before really Scen in such great danger as now, and therefore the sense of it pressed upon his mind in a way that caused him to review his position. To have rescued such a being as Arline appeared to him, would have fluttered many a more experienced soldier than himself; but to one not trained to assault from the enemy within, the defence was poorly made, alnd after a trifling show of resistance on his part, he began to think of capitulating. It was a weak fortress, however, that he defended, as lhe ascertained on sur- render , for no attack had been intended, and the foe quietly retired without taking possession. So certain was Murphy that something had gone wrong with hin, that on the next morning after the rescue, and before they started from their camp, he took the clergyman aside, and after passing sundry sage and grave remarks upon the weather, the Indians in particular, making several blunders. and wiping the perspiration from his forehead, he thus commenced to dis- charge that with which he was burdened: "Your daughter don't seem to look well this morning. Them infiarnal Ingins must have frightened the young critter terribly." "She is not my daughter, my friend," said Mr. Monroe, "though I love her as such." Ah, I thought not. Some relation, I 'spose?" "Nor relation either," replied the clergyman. 'What can the poor thing be doing alone out here in the wilderness?" half asked, half exclaimed Murphy, though the intelligence was rather pleas- ing to him than otherwise.  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7034-00000046"/> 90          REBELS  AND  TORIES. "She is not alone, my friend. She is5 beneath our protection," said Mr. Monroe, with dignity. "Rather poor protection, I should think, judging from what has happened," said Murphy. "Too true, my friend. I begin to repent of bringing her here to encounter such dangers as already threaten. If she should receive harm I could never forgive myself." And Mr. Monroe sighed as his eyes turned toward the place where Arline was standing. "Well," said Murphy, somewhat proudly. "I guess she can always find an arm to help her or fight for her if need be, or I don't know a red Ingin from a black b'ar!" "I believe you," said Mr. Monroe. "And judging from the specimen which you have already given us of your bravery and adroitness, the assistance in such a ease would be effectual." "If I wouldn't I'm a buzzard, and hope to be shot for my beauty?" The conversation here ended, and everything being ready for their depar- ture, Murphy and the Wild Medicine concluded to accompany the little party until an opportunity offered of putting them under the escort of a band of Oneidas whom they knew to be in the neighborhood, and who were on their way to Cherry Valley for the purpose of putting the inhabitants on their guard in respect to a rumored descent which there was every reason to expect would be made upon that part of the country by the Indians and tories under Brant and Butler. Before they parted company, Murphy had an opportunity of conversing with Arline; and when they did part, he was as completely shot through and throughpas was ever an Indian targets But he could not penetrate the mystery of Arline's melancholy; and though he attributed it to all the causes which he could imagine, he was still ignorant of the true one. Under other circumstances, it might have been hazardous to calculate the result of his attentions. His manners, though a little uncouth, were far from displeasing- he was courageous and handsome-and these recommendations, backed by the service which he had rendered, rould have made him a dangerous day's companion for a young lady whose heart was not invulnerable. Being now compelled to march on foot, the progress of the little party was slow, as Mrs. Monroe, complaining of "a stitch in her side," was obliged to sit down occasionally to gain breath for a fresh start. This sometimes gave Murphy and Arline an opportunity to walk ahead-chances most pleasing to the former. At such times Murphy would entertain his companion with taes of wonder, in which Indians, bears, panthers, wolves and buffalo, figured extensively. "Ah, my dear lady!" he exclaimed, " you can't pictur' to yourself one half the dangers of the forest! I have been taken prisoner by the Ingins six times, sentenced to the stake twice, run the gauntlet twice, and once I thought my scalp was gone. I've fit a b'ar at close hugs, beat off a pack of wolves, been run over by a herd of buffalo, been shot three times. and I guess I'm as good as ever."   REBELS   AND  TORIES.           91 "1 You must have had a severe time of it," said Arliue, and without scarcely being aware of what he had been saying. "You may well say that. But that ain't what I care about. It is some- times that I feel lonely, and then I think-suppose I should get killed by an Ingin, who'd mourn for me? You see there is where it touches!" "But surely one so brave and generous as yourself can never want for friends?" said Arline, in a manner that made Murphy look in her face. But there was no expression in her countenance to indicate what he hoped to see reflected there. ': Friends! Well I don't know what you may call a friend; but I never thought much of them. It's adversity that teaches us who are our friends- not those who, as soon as Kyou need their assistance, and can no more tender them yours, forsake you for better quarterl." "I hope one meets with but few such friends in life; for the path seems to me rough enough without such pits to fall in as false friendships." Arline sighed, for her thoughts were wandering back to her native city and to the two graves. Murphy stole another glance towards her, and ob- served a tear steal down the fair check of his companion. This was his death blow: he might have withstood all but that with a firn heart; but lie look- ed upon that tear, and fell. There was no more peace for him. He con- tinued: "In this world, if you'll believe me, one is continually meeting with persons who stand ready to betray. Every twelfth man is a Judas. But I won't say that I have no friends. There is one of them, I believe, the Wild Medicine as the Ingins call him. He and I have slept on the ground many a night to- gether, and shared our last crumb. Though lhe is an odd chicken he has got an honest and a true heart. I haven't got many as true friends as the Wild Medicine. But a man wants another sort of a friend-some one in whose car he may trust his secrets-some one who can understand all his soul. Look at me, now. You see a poor homeless critter, without so much as a board to put over me; and if I were to be taken sick, where could I make my bed, or get any doctor; though for that matter I don't think much of that craft. Iow- somever I'm blessed with good health and a clear conscience; and my slum- ber is as sweet on the bare earth as that of many who sleep in, fine beds." "With such feelings, I don't sec who you find to envy," said Arline. "I never knew what envy was yet. But you see, when a man gets to be of my condition, I don't see as he is much better than a wild beast. I think, sometimes, that a man has higher duties to perform than always to be a-look- ing out after number one-that some how or other he don't fulfil his destiny unless he lives in some fianner or other beneficial to his race. I'm sure I aint fit for nothing, unless to kill Ingins; and if the war should end, I don't know what would become of me." "There is a Providence that protects all who trust. If our purposes in life be honest, I see not what fear we need have of the future." ' There it is. You see I aint got faith enough to trust, and for that reason I am continually grumbling. If I only had such a friend as yourself to coun-  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7034-00000047"/> 92         REBELS   AND TORIES, sel me, and cheer me, occasinally, I think I should get along very well. But where shall I find one, unless you accept the trust?" "I fear I should make but a sorry counsellor; and as for cheerfulness, I doubt but the clouds would deny you sunshine." And as Arline said this, she turned to look for her companions, who were now coming bravely on in the rear. "Well," said Murphy, " we must soon part; but I can't do so without re- gret, for it seems just as though I should not like the thought of never seeing you again. I think we have got pretty well acquainted for the short time we have known each other. And though I am rude, rough and unpolished, I can't help the natural feelings that come over me; so if I say anything you don't like to hear, tell me so, and I'll be off arter the Ingins and try to forget all about it." "I don't know, really, what you could say to annoy me," said Arline, with gTeat simplicity. "I am sure we are all under the most lasting obligations to you, and you may be sure we: shall never forget it. So at least you may consider that you have three sincere friends in the world." "I can't say it!" exclaimed Murphy to himself; "so I'll even die as great a blockhead as I have always lived." At this moment he detected the Wild Medicine making a sign to him; and changing his manner and voice in an in- stant, he exclaimed: "Here come the Ingins! Don't be scared. They are Oneidas. Now, in a few minutes, you will go your way and I mine. If I never see you again, God bless you!" The rest of the party had now joined them; and turning to Mr. Monroe, Murphy laid his hand upon the clergyman's shoulder, and, as he pointed out to him the advancing Indians, said: "There, Mr. Minister, is your escort. We are a-going to part-you to go your way and I mine. These Oneidas will see you safely to the end of your journey, unless Brant meets you; and if that is the case, you will have a chance of seeing one of the prettiest Ingin fights you ever dreamt of. But 'taint likely, for I guess the half-civilized savage must be in the neighborhood of Unadilla." They were by this time discovered by the Indians, and immediately the war-cry was sounded, and the whole party came rushing down upon the little company, brandishing thleir weapons, and with violent gestures, appearing as though determined on " bloody action." The dominie and the two females were extremely frightened-Mrs. Monroe in particular, who exclaimed, with terror: "What will become of us? ie shall all be eaten!t Appearances, certainly, were alarming to our travellers, till assured by Murphy that there was not the least danger, as he would convince them in a moment. He directed their attention to tho Wild Medicine, who was running toward the Indians with gestures quite as violent as their own. As soon as he had approached to within about an hundred yards of them, le was recog- nised, when all warlike demonstrations ceased, and in a few moments more our tr:vellers were formally introdthed. Preliminaries were easily arranged.   REBELS AND TORIES.             93 and after a warm leave-taking, Murphy and the Wild Medicine struck into the forest in an opposite direction, while the Oneidas. with their new compan- ions, pursued their course toward Cherry Valley. At parting with Arline, Murphy took her hand, and pressing it warmly, and invoking upon her head all manner of blessings, he ventured a hope that le might see her again. Hler reply was but a word. Thankful to him for the service he had done them her mind was confused betwixt this feeling and one of embarrassment at his strange behavior-behavior which she could not misunderstand; though her affections were so fresh for the memory of poor, Rowley. Thus, with a bless- ing from Mr. Monroe, and the wairmest thanks of Mrs. M., he waved an adieu and in a moment after was lost sight of.       I Though the service rendered to the little party by the Wild Medicine was as important as that of Murphy, the former kept himself so aloof from con- versation with them, that they scarcely had an opportunity of thanking him. At parting with them. therefore, he merely took the hand of Arline, and look- ing upon its palm, exclaimed: "A fair palm. Not many crosses. Some have been recent. Some danger to come. Beware! here is a struggle! There is an evil demon somewhere. Be wise and you will foil him. eIre is a snake and an eagle; but the eagle shall reign. Don't sleep too soundly! don't breathe too hardly! When you least expect it, you shall sec me again. Go where you will, I shall find you!" Turning then to the clergyman, he thus addressed him: "Old man, you must not cease to watch. You will be held responsible if you do. Listen for the screeching of the owl! for graves have yawned before now! And men have seen ghosts walk! And why not? If men are put away secretly, and in the dark, why should they not rise to accuse?

Thus saying, he waved his hand and departed; and the mystery of this being haunted Mr. Monroe on his journey over the mountains, on his descent into the valley, in the privacy of his new home, in the pulpit, and for days and days, until" CIAPTER XVIII. THE TRAVELLER. THE blood of the Mohawk was now fairly in heat, and the year 1778 stands unparalleled in the history of savage warfare and ferocity. The subjects of the crown had good reason to be proud of their ascendancy over the minds of the Indians, and of their own policy and humanity in being able to enlist them in the cause of a heartless tyranny. Stimulated by large rewards for scalps, and deceived by misrepresentations, the red man was found a will- ing tool in the hands of the British; and when yotu associate with these,  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7034-00000048"/> "         REBELS  AND  TORIES. the Tories, a class of men whose brutal acts, most inhuman propensities, and cold-blooded murders, even sent a thrill of horror through the breast of the savage, you have materiel such as no other army ever possessed, and which, pitted against any other foe than the heroic men of the Revolution, would have carried annihilation to the very hearth-stones of the enemy. And the master-spirit of these legions, their never-resting, never-tiring leader in the Mo- hawk country was the semi-civilized Brant-the terrible Thayendanega. And yet the British officers, so boastful of their honor and their chivalry-the British crown, so jealous of its glory and renown, shrunk not from the infamy of em- ploying as allies the most sanguinary warriors the world ever knew, but even paid them a price for mutilating the bodies of the dead. by tearing from them the scalp as the bloody witness of their success ;-nor women nor children were spared the indiscriminate slaughter! Foremost in the catalogue comes the burning of Springfield, at the head of Otsego Lake. This was in the early part of '78. Those of the inhabitants who were unable to escape were either killed or made prisoners, and the en- tire settlement burnt. The women and children in this case were spared. This expedition was led by Brant. The next of consequence was the 'ttle of Cobbleskill, in July, killing and making prisoners the inhabitants, burning the houses and destroying all the horses and cattle. In the same month- even the day following the affair at Cobbleskill-occurred the ever-memorable Wyoming massacre, the history of which must be in the mouth of every school boy. For unparalleled cruelty it stands pre-eminent. All throughout the Mohawk country the inhabitants were unceasingly harasssed by the Tories and Indians. At their daily vocations, at their sabbath worship, even when they slept, it was necessary for them to be continually armed; and at the present day, we may wonder why the Indian country was not entirely abandoned by the white settlers, sooner than live in continual jeopardy of their lives. Yet, it would seem that where danger is the most imminent, and existence the most precarious, there will always be found brave hearts to peril, and strong arms to resist; for there must be an excitement, even an in- toxication, in extreme hazards. The day following that on which Leffers was made prisoner by Wass- hemett, a young man of athletic build, and habited for a journey, passed up the country, in sight of the Mohawk. He was mounted, and the horse that bore him showed evident signs of fatigue. Though the' appearance of the rider would not warrant a doubt of his courage, yet in his manner there was a restlessness that indicated suspicion or alarm. His eye passed rapidly from point to point along his way, occasionally resting for,a moment upon the river whenever a glimpse of its waters appeared through the trees. He was armed with a pair of horse pistols, and over' his shoulder was slung a short rifle. That he was not accustomed to the saddle was evident from his awkwardness in the seat, and from the fact that he was nearly thrown from the shying of the horse, which had been startled from the rustling of bushes near by, and the sudden appearance of an Indian warrior Regaining his balance, however, and his nerve, his hand was in an instant upon one of his pistols. Involun- tarily he had stopped his horse, and as he fixed his eyes upon the being before   REBELS AND    TORIES.          95 him, he seemed to doubt whether to take him for friend or foe. The Indian scanned his appearance with an eye that would read him to the soul. For a minute, perhaps, neither spoke; and t first to break the silence was the horsman. ' What want you with me? Are you friend or foe?" To whom?" asked the other. "To the king!" was the reply, as a pistol was drawn from the holster, to be ready for he reply. "To the king," said the red man, as he approached the side of the horse. "You are a messenger from Sir Henry Clinton-or you have a message from him-to Walter Butler?" "'How came you by the information?" "It matters not. You need not see Butler. Deliver me the message." "How am I sure that I shall be justified by trusting important documents to you?" ': Suppose I give you no reason, but take them at once," said the Indian." "That would be determined by a struggle which might terminate to your disadvantage," said the traveller, gathering up the reins, and bringing the pistol which he held into a better position for defence. 'You need not alarm yourself. I have authority to detain you, and re- ceive the letters which you carry to Butler." "From whom have you authority?" asked the traveller, relaxing a little in his guard?"  "From grant." "Where is he?" "Here!" And the chieftain drew himself up proudly as he leaned with one arm upon his rifle. Satisfied that it really was Brant who stood before him, and convinced that in a struggle he would have the worst of it, he delivered over the papers to the chieftain, who put them in his pouch, after having satisfied himself that the superscription upon them was correct. "In what direction is Walter Butler to be found?" said the horseman, as he turned away from his unceremonious visitor to pursue his journey. "It is unimportant for you to know. You are upon business of your own; so go your own ways. When you are wanted you will be found." Darting into the thicket from which he had issued, Brant left the traveller to pursue his way, wondering at the singular introduction which had made him acquainted with the terrible Thayendanega; at the same time congratu- lating himself with this thought: ' But there is good fortune in this meeting; for, having gotten rid of Sir Henry's packages, I shall at once resign my obli- gation to him, and take the occasion to wander a little on my own business, taking some future opportunity to seek the valiant Captain Butler." So the traveller pursued his way for half an hour longer, absorbed in deep thought, when turning the angle of the path he was again stopped by a being of singular and grotesque appearance, who sprang directly before him, and with outstretched arms commanded him to stop. His first impulse was to  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7034-00000049"/> 96          REBELS AND TORIES. dash his spurs into his horse's flanks, and with a bound ride over and pros- trate the person who now stood in his way. But his thoughts seemed to have been read, for with a wild gesture, and with his right arm extended in an attitude of defiance, he accosted the horseman thus: '"Ralph Upton! take heed where yolride! There are birds in the air that twitter of your business. - There are owls out o' nights to catch your sleeping thoughts. Can you escape? Beware!" "What singular being are you,/that you thus throw yourself in my way? Aside there, fool, and let me pass, or you may feel the print of my horse's hoofs upon your temples!"  "You are a brave lad, and but a lad. Do you talk of murder! Who saw it.?-the stars?" There was a momentary struggle. The horseman writhed in his stirrups. With set teeth and clenched hands he eyed his adversary for an instant, and then muttered. "Devil or fiend! why have you met me here? Out of my path old man, else I crush you!" "Oh, you are used to that-if one is in your path,-and who would be a witness!" "Who are you that cross me here in the solitary forest, and call my name?" "I saw the deed! It was a cunning trick-a bold device; and nobody suspected you! Ha! ha! None so brave as the sexton-none so true as the coffin-maker!" "Liar! Who saw it?" exclaimed the horseman, in an agony of vehemence. "The stars do not prate, grey-beard-v-the dark waters give not up their secrets." "Ralph Upton, there are eyes above us that you cannot dim-ears around us that will not- be deaf. What say you-shall I prate?" "Never," exclaimed the latter, presenting and discharging a pistol at the person of his interrogator; but, ere the smoke cleared off, the some voice ex- claimed, behind him:- I Ha! ha! Would you be a parricide, too! Hark, Ralph- The blood of the murdered shall rise again, To haunt and accuse each guilty Cain! Nor tfie bosom of earth, nor the fathomless water, Can bury the crime of that dreadful slaughter!" "Fiend! who saw it? Not you! Why doyou defy me to more crim V? ' Revenge! Do you think I work without a purpose? Boy! since you was born I hated you-twenty two years ago. It is a long memory, but a good one. You commenced life by the destruction of another, and such shall be your end!" "Who are you, then?" exclaimed Ralph. "Do you ask me? I am-but you must not know at present. Go on in your career. Never believe I will stop you. But when next you commit a murder, see there are no eyes above you-for the sky is full of them-deep,   REBELS  AND  TORIES.          97 searching eyes. Now go your ways, I say. Canry your messages from tyrant to minion-turn spy at last, for there is no infamy too deep for you! And if you see Walter Butler, tell him, you met the Wild Medicine-he will know what you mean. Tell him to beware of me, for I am by him oftener than he wots of!" "Strange being, do you know everything?" exclaimed Upton in amaze- ment. "The world!" almost shrieked the other. "You more than all the world beside! You are seeking now for a girl. You would destroy her, but you shall be thwarted. Beware! for I read your thoughts. Dare to injure her, and there is no beast of prey in the forest, no carrion bird in the air, but shall tear you and peck at you! Go on! Pursue your solitary path, but think not that you can hide, for annihilation cannot swallow you! Farewell!" Leaving Upton in utter amazement-confounded because of his discovered guilt-in anger with himself that he had not slain his accuser-the. Wild Medicine darted from his presence with the agility of a hare, and Upton putting spurs to his jaded steed, sprang forward upon his journey, muttering curses in reply to the loud laugh that pursued him through the long echoes of the forest! 'CAPTER XIX. TH SACRIFICE AND THE AVENGEF AGAIN the stake was prepared-the death-song chaunted, and the danokV begun. The victim was bound writhing to the stake, while brush and dry wood were piled up around him ready to ignite. The dreadful torture of insult had already commenced. The boys of the nation crowded round the unfortunate being whose fate it was to suffer, and iht sharp-pointed sticks would they seek to wound the prisoner, while the Woinin of the tribe assembled about to insult him with jeers, to spit upon him, and to strike him. Yet no cry of agony broke from him-no supplication escaped his lips. lie probably knew too well that such weakness, instead of exciting pity, would only lengthen his torture, and subject him to additional suffering. At length, a warrior advanced from the assemblage. and standing in front of the prisoner, thus addressed him: "Does the white man want to be a brave? Can he not cry to the Great Spirit to release him? He is a dog?" And he advanced near enough to the prisoner to slap him over the eyes with his open hand. But the man at the stake, instead of flinching from his treatment, returned the look of the warrior with one equally fierce, at the same time spitting at him in utter contempt. This act on the part of the vxi- tim, instead of bringing upon himself any punishment, elicited loud cheers of satisfaction from those who saw it, thus giving testimony of their admiration  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7034-00000050"/> 98          REBELS AND TORIES. for this act of defiance. Another warrior now advanced to within two feet of the stake, and in a low and gutteral voice spoke as follows: "What can the pale face say? Why comes he to the lodges of the red man to steal? ., When the Great Spirit made the red man and the pale face he placed between them the big waters, for he knew that his white children were dogs. But they have angered their Great Father by crossing the big waters to rob and kill his red children. You steal our squaws, you rob us of our game, you take from us our hunting grounds, and you tread upon the graves of our fathers. We have taken up the hatchet to destroy those who are our enemies. We mean to slay till they are all gone. The white trader is very brave. It is a pleasant sight to our squaws and our papooses." The speaker retired, and was immediately succeeded by another, who, ad- vancingin front of the victim, looked him steadily in the eye for a minute, and then spoke as follows: Wasshemett has promised you to the Great Spirit. He has never slept a sweet sleep since the Young Fawn left the lodges of her people in the canoe of the white trader. You say you are the friend of the Indian now-that you fight for our great master, the king. We don't believe you. The pale face has a double tongue. The truth is no longer in him. He must die!" Wasshemett again mixed with the assemblage; and then commenced a dance, which for its wildness and its fiend-like character, seemed to belong more to the regions of the accursed than to the ceremonies of human beings, however savage. Mingled with the terrific war-whoop, it was enough to pros- trate stronger nerves than Leffers'-for it was him that was now about to suf- fer such a dreadful death. For an hour this scene lasted, and being in the evening, the glare of the torches gave the place the appearance of Pandemo- nium, when all the fiends of the infernal pit have assembled to celebrate some monstrous orgies. But no groans escaped the lips of Leffers-no muscle or nerve failed in its duty in sustaining him against the horror of the moment. He well knew that his only chance for escape lay in his being able to suffer manfully-that a quiver of the lip would destroy his last hope of rescue-for such hope he had, induced by the superstitious faith which he held for the constancy of his first dread enemy. Though for years he had been pursued unrelentingly by a foe whose presence never failed to fill him with horror, he now for the first time would have welcomed him as a brother to escape the awful fate which seemed inevitable. Willingly would he have bared his breast to the rifle of Wild Medicine, and thanked him for the act that should end for ever the suspense that was more agonizing, than such a death would be. But hope seemed vain to him, and though he looked round upon the savage faces that grew hideous with the gleam of satisfied ferocity, and his eye quailed ot, nor his lip quivered, still hope grew fainter, and his heart sank deeper at every yell' of vengeance that echoed through the forest, till glen and rock sent back the sounds in more appalling tones. Presently an aged chief advanced from the crowd, and after addressing him for a minute or two in .unintelligible gikberish, but which Leffers gathered from his manner was meant for reproach, ingled with some complimentary   REBELS  AND  TORIES.          99 remarks upon his apparently stoical indifference to life, he commenced chaunt- ing a low irregular song, wlich, as it proceeded, grew more violent, till the tap of the Indian drum joined in as a chorus, followed by the voices of all the principal warriors. Leffers knew by this that the climax Hvas approaching, and uttering a low prayer which fell upon his spirit like an additional curse, he commended his soul to the Giver of Life, and tried to resign himself to the inevitableness of his fate. At this stage of the proceedings, Wasshemett, with a torch, advanced to the prisoner, and spoke: "The white trader is very brave. He makes no cry like the frightened squaw; but he must die. The Fawn is no longer in the lodge of Wasshomett. Her heart grew very sore, and like the young pigeon that wanders mateless, the plumage of her cheek fell, and the pale sickness wasted her frame. It is many moons since, and the snows have fallen upon your head, but Wasshe- mett does not forget. Last night she came to me as I slept, and she told me that she was alone in the spirit land, and she rested badly beneath the mossy hillock where I put her to sleep. You have been spared a long time, and you have done many bad things which the Great Spirit is angry about. The Young Fawn longs to see you. She looks from the hunting ground in the first star of the misty even, and her heart is sad that the voice that played its music to her cannot be heard there. Her sorrow has touched the heart of the good Manitou, and, for that she is as unspotted as the lily of the small pond, whose white leaves and golden bosom expand to the sweet airs of sum- mer, and her voice, musical as the voices in the spring forest, haing touched his heart with a love to her, he has said that she might send for the white trader, whose words in her youthtime fell on her ear like the wild bee's honey on the tongue of children. You must go. It is a great honor for a pale face to visit the happy hunting ground of the red man, and you will make the heart of the Fawn glad that you depart with the dignity of a great brave. Wasshemett shall sing your death-song, and on the borders of the spirit land you shall find waiting a band of warriors to guide you through the dark long passage to the Great Light. Wasshemett is very proud-very proud of his pale brother; and when the fire-agony is done, he will hold a great feast over his ashes, with which he shall sprinkle the heads of the young braves that they may be mighty in battle, and flinch not from the long knives of the pale faces. lie is done." At the conclusion of this speech, another chorus was chaunted, and stoop- ing, Wasshemett was about to apply the torch to the faggots, when a rustling in the bushes near him caused him to turn his eye in that direction, and in an instant more, a wild being sprang to the foot of the pile, and with a blow from a short rifle which he carried, he struck the brand from the hand of the savage. An exclamation of surprise escaped from the Indians at this intewarpton of the ceremonies; but the persolthat thrust himself between their barbarous custom of revenge and the helpless object of it, waved them back with Iis hand as they attempted to advance upon him, and with the dignity of a mon- arch, maintained his position by the side of his intended victim.  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7034-00000051"/> 100         REBELS  AND  TORIES. It was the Wild Medicine! Waiting in vain for a few moments, that some one of the savages might address him, he broke the silence by exclaiming: "No! Wassl4emett! No! warriors and braves! No! old chiefs of the Onondaga! The victim is mine! The hair of his scalp-the breath of his nostrils-they are mine! In the gloom of the great forest-in the awful darkness of night-lhe is mine! By the wind that blows, by the tempest that wracks, by the eternal thunder, and the blue and livid glare of the lightning's flash!-he is mine! By the vengeance that is sweet, by the eye that sleeps not, by the memory that forgets not, by the hatred that stints not, by the heart that never forgives!-he is mine!" And placing himself in front of Leffers, with his arms raised in defiance, the Wild Medicine looked round upon the group about him with an air that questioned the right of any one to dispute him. Among the chiefs a great sensation had been produced, and by their eager gestures and violent speech toward one another, a spectator of the scene might have supposed there was a storm rising that boded no good to him who had so audaciously interfered with one of their most rigid ceremonies. Undismayed, however, stood the Wild Medicine, with his figure apparently expanded to twice its natural size, while the lurid glare of the torches lighted up his features with a supernatural glow. Evidently prepared for the worst, though doubtful of the issue, no muscle of his face betrayed the least indecision or fear; and he listened to the debate which had arisen respecting his intrusion with the calm gravity of a judge. One chief, younger than the rest, was for putting him to instant torture, and when he found that his warmth would not influence the others, in utter disregard of all ceremony, and defiant of that order which becomes an Indian council, he turned, and whirling his tomahawk around his head, with the terrible war-cry of his tribe, he flung it at the feet of the prisoner with such exact precision that it divided one of the thongs that bound his ankles. It failed, however, to produce the excitement sought; and the old chief who had previously spoken, said to the young warrior as he turned away: "Peltasharoo is a fool. The old chiefs would see the scalp in his lodge. Go! be a great brave-take many scalps, and the wise men of the nation will listen to him!" As though stung by an adder, Peltasharoo raised his arm to smite the speaker, but the unquailing eye of the old chief caused him to shrink from its gaze, and he glided noiselessly past, and sought in his lodge a retreat from the shame which he had brought upon himself. The old chief then turning to the intruder, addressed him thus: "Why does the Wild Medicine come. like a wild buffalo bull, into the judg- ment council of the Onondaga? There are many arrows in the hands of our braves, why does the Wild Medicine put his head beneath the sharp blow of the tomahawk? Let him spey "The victim is mine!

' He is the prisoner of Wasshemett. lie has given him to the Great Spirit," said the chief. "By the wind that blows! by the tempest that wracks! by the eternal thunder, and the blue and livid glare of the lightning's flash! he is mine!" exclaimed the Wild Medicine, raising his arm above his head, as though invoking the powers which he had named. "The Wild Medicine is our brother. His faith is good with the Onondaga. Will he say that the white trader of the forked tongue is not the prisoner of Wasshemett?" said the chief. "Let him ask for himself," replied the Wild Medicine. "The Wild Medicine is a great fox. He is very cunning," said the old chief, stepping back, to give place to Wasshemett, who. as he advanced, said: "The words of the Wild Medicine are in my ear. They are not sweet. Why does my brother step into the folds of the serpent?" "Death! The victim is mine. Sworn to-witnessed! Wasshemett has slept in the lodge of the Wild Medicine. He is a great brave, with many scalps-a great hunter! He must give his pale brother this prisoner for the fire-torture." "My brother asks a great thing. He is very dear to Wasshemett. But the prisoner is very dear to Wasshemett. also. Let him ask again." "He is mine!" said the Wild Medicine. "By the vengeance that is sweet! by the eye that sleeps not! by the memory that forfets not! by the hatred that stints not! by the heart that never forgives!-he is mine!" "Will the Wild Medicine open the eyes of Wasshemett? He speaks in a strange tongue, and his words are hard to the ears of our braves." "Mine!" said he. "L Many years ago-more than twenty snows back- he came to my lodge when my heart was sore, and he did me a wrong which I shall never forgive." Here he paused for a moment. "My ears are open. Let the Wild Medicine Speak," said Wasshemett. "The words are many, for the tale is long," said he. "I am hungry, for I have tramped far to-night. The lodge of my red brother is full of venison. Let us go there. Bring all your braves, and when I have eaten, as you smoke your pipes, in a full council will I tell you my wrongs; and your old chiefs and your great braves shall judge me ifI be right or wrong. If right, the jus- tice of the red man shall secure me my victim; if wrong, let me perish by the fire-torture. I have spoken." Saying this, he folded his arms over the muzzle of his rifle to await the de- cision of Wasshemett. The latter, after conversing a few moments with those Who surrounded him, some of whom showed evident signs of displeasure, while others, more patient, listened attentively to his words. The majority, how- ever, seemed unwilling that the awful rites should be longer delayed, and the Wild Medicine began to grow doubtful about the success of his application, when the voice of the old chief silenced the tongues of the rest. and he spoke as follows:  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7034-00000052"/> 102         REBELS   AND  TORIES. "It is good. The Wild Medicine has spoken. Let us hear his words. Come to the lodge of Wasshemett." And leading the way, he was followed by the whole party, leaving Leffers at the stake. All were anxious to hear what claim the Wild Medicine could set up to property in the prisoner, and all equally anxious that he might be as brief as possible, for they doubted not that they should be gratified, by early dawn at least, by the burning of their victim, while they feasted their eyes and their eats with the convulsive agony and dreadful shrieks of the doomed Leffers. Ere the Wild Medicine left him, however, he turned upon him with a terrific gleam of triumph, and whispered to him: "Not yet. Nahum Leffers-not yet.! Fear not the torture. You are de- voted to my special revenge. Twice from the stake have I saved you. The cords are now cut tiat bind you. What to do your own judgment must tell you; but don't you fly from me. Not from the wrath of Heaven can you fly!" Thus saying, he left the object of his hatred, and proceeded with the Indians to the lodge of Wasshemett, about a hundred yards distant. Here, after break- ing his fast, he commenced to tell the.. story of his wrongs, in little hopes to gain anything more than time. But, as he proceeded, his auditors grew more and more interested, and they gathered round him with the attention which they sometimes pay to one of their own warriors, when he relates the inci- dents of some desperate combat, or recounts the horror of some terrible re- venge. All at once, however, while in. the height of his narrative, the ears of the party weire assailed by the deafening war-cry from without, and rushing from the lodge, they, saw, Peltasharoo fly past them, followed by a half-score of warriors. What the pursuit was they could not tell, till Wasshemett, hur- rying to the spot-where he had left hisprisoner, found that the stake was de- serted, and the sacrifice gone. Uttering a yell of disappointment, he joined in the pursuit, followed by the rest of thB party. Sdouts were sent out in differ- ent directions, and taking advantage of the confusion, the Wild Medicine, at a few bounds, reached the shelter of the forest, not alarmed if he should be discovered, as by making a feint of searching for the fugitive, he would not be suspected of having given Leffers the means of escape. His purpose was at least effected. The victim was preserved for his own peculiar revenge.  CHAPTER XX. AN UNEXPECTED GUEST. No sooner had Upton got rid of the troublesome personages mentioned in a preceding chapter, than, finding himself freed from his embassy to Walter N. Butler, and at liberty to pursue a route more congenial to his wishes, he struck off in an opposite direction front that which he was pursuing, ascend- ing the high country south of the Mohawk, with the intention of crossing over into Cherry Va!ley. Having, as a matter of course, no honorable pur-   REBELS  AND  TORIES.          103 pose in view, it will not be supposed that his solitary journey was performed under the most happy auspices, as far as regards quietude of mind. Impure consciences are ever more or less affected with fear; and although possessing a more than average amount of physical courage, it is doubtful if at times, when passing gloomy tracks of forest, or glens of tangled underbrush, our young traveller did not mentally feel the presence of some hidden judgment upon his already numerous crimes. Visions of Indian bands and gleaming tomahawks occasionally flitted before him; and although he knew their pres- ence before him could have no connection with any of his deeds of guilt, he at the same time felt that some high power might raise up, even in the forest's solitudes, a judgment against him, at once condemning and punishing. But in the mysteries of Providence there are designs as unfathomable as the deep- est caverns of the ocean; and every day around us we see preserved for more remote, and perhaps more retributive, justice, those whom the law has no proof against, although society has already branded them with the most odious marks of suspicion and distrust. And thus, fortunately for Upton, in his own way of thinking, though the forest at the time was thronged with savages, many of whom were roaming bloodthirsty-from the horrid massacres of Wyoming, he passed on to the desired end ohiis journey without molesta- tion, arriving on the second day after his interview with Brant, in Cherry Valley.  But our traveller has not yet entered the village: let us anticipate his arri- val a few minutes, and see if we can recognise among its inhabitants any familiar face or well-beloved acquaintance. What a gladsome and pleasant scene! It is the ripe and fruitful month of August. The settlement is quietly reposing in the bosom of the beautiful valley whose name it bears; and those of its inhabitants whose agricultural pursuits do not occupy their time, are whiling it listlessly away in front of their own dwellings, or in groups of two or three dispersed about the village in the midst of a warm and hazy summer's afternoon. The most general topic of conversation is of course the war, and its most prominent subjects are the recent barbarities at Wyoming, and the attempt the, preceding summer, made by Brant, to surprise their own settlement. And still some fears were entertained by the inhabitants, that the chagrin of the Indian chief at his want of success upon that occasion, would only prompt him to renewed meas- ures to ensure their destruction. Let us now visit one of the houses of this settlement, and see what sort of felicity is enjoyed by a family of old acquaintances of ours. The building is a rude but comfortable log hut, with a piazza running along in front, facing the east, upon which we shall find seated, the Rev. Mr. Monroc and wife, Arline, and one or two neighbors who have called for the purpose of making a sociable visit, and of having an hour's pleasant chat with their newly ar- rived settlers. Spread out upon the lap of the clergyman was the large family Bible, from which he had been descanting on the arrival of his visitors; his spouse was engaged in the laudable service of mending the heels of a pair of hose, while Arline was embroidering the border of a Sunday cap, to adorn the healthy cheeks of her kind patroness on holidays and church days. The  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7034-00000053"/> 104         REBELS AND    TORIES. conversation for some .time had been general, but had gradually merged into a consideration of their own affairs and the welfare of their own beautiful vil- lage. They had been speaking of Brant's attempted invasion of the preced. ing summer, and the fate of Lieut. Wormwood, who had been dispatched from Palatine to give notice to the inhabitants of Cherry Valley of the intended ir- rupton.  "It was a sad case, sir," said one of his visitors, a Mr, Wells; "so young, so gallant, so full of promise, to be cut off in so sunlmary a manner by the wild and desperate savage. It can be little short of murder-little short of murder, reverend sir; as he was shot and scalped by Brant himself, who, how- ever sorry he has since professed himself to be for the act, cannot, through any principle which I am willing to recognise, excuse himself from the un- warrantable cruelty of having assassinated his friend." But you forget, Robert," said his wife, " that it is not certain that Brant did kill the lieutenant. It was one of the chances of war, and the utmost cruelty that can be proved against the chieftain in this affair is that he scalped the fallen officer with his own hand." "Ay, ay! I know they say so," he replied, " but the mind that can prompt so great. an outrage upon the body of an expiring fellow creature, (a legal enemy, if you please,) in my opinion is not too refined to commit the act which deprived that body of life. This case touches me nearly, my dear." "   But, Robert," said his wife, "It was thought by Brant (so he says,) that the lieutenant was an officer of the Continental Army." "What matters it!" he exclaimed, " so long as the- treacherous deed was accomplished. Were they not friends? and is that no guarantee for faith?" "But very little, my dear sir," said the clergyman, coming to the relief of Mrs. Wells. "In such unnatural wars as this, and where it is not an uncom- mon sight to see son arrayed against father in the mortal strife, brother against brother, there is no reason why we should wonder that the savage forgets his faith or his friendship, particularly when arrayed against him in opposite fac- tions. Indeed, so far through this contest, and in preceding wars which we have had with these sons of the forest, we find them fighting upon the same modes and principles; and because they change not their tactics for those more humane, it is not upon that account alone that we must blame them. Rather let the odium and the sin rest with those who bribe them into their service, and whose war-cry alone hoots them on to massacre and carnage. And for this reason I pray, and for this reason I believe, that this unholy war on the part of our oppressors cannot prosper to them: and that they alone, nmore than the deluded Indians, seven fold, will be obliged to answer for the cause of such human sacrifices. I am sure that God's justice will not for ever slumber; and as sure as the blue-arching Heaven is above us, I have the utmost faith in the final redemption of God's own people; and that is no stronger than the belief that retribution will follow the bad promoters of this cruel war." At the conclusion of this speech, the eyes of good Mistress Monroe lifted themselves from the work before them, and peered over the top of her specta. eles at the clergyman with a wonderfil glance of love and admiration. They                          \   REBELS AND TORIES.              105f said '; Amen!" as plainly as eyes ever spoke, and expressed a deal more of smuttered things that made the bosom of the good wife such a happy dwelling- place for themselves. Arline had also stopped her embroidery, for she had felt interested in the fate of young Wormwood. She wanted to ask a ques- tion, but dared not; and she was struggling considerably with her curiosity, when she was happily relieved by Mrs. Monroe, whose thoughts happened to be running the same way. " And pray tell me," said the good lady, lifting off her glasses as though she was willing to listen, " and pray tell me who was this young officer whom you seem to regret so much? He must have been a marvelous proper young man to have persons so discreet as yourself, Mr. Wells, speak so highly of him."' ' Nothing, madam, will delight me more than to tell you. It is fortunate that my sister is not here. Poor Jane! she took his loss sadly, for he was a frequent visitor at our house, and we all took much delight in his society." "I think you intimated he did not belong to the Continental army?'" said the clergyman. "But a member of the Tryon County Militia," answered Mr. Wells. "Well, sir, from some unmistakeable signs, and from rumors, the inhabitants of Palatine got information of Brant's intended attack upon this settlement in May of last year, and a messenger was desired to bring the information hither, that Colonel Klock's regiment of militia, stationed at that place, would march to our defence the next morning. The Committee of Vigilance waited a con- siderable time for some one to volunteer for the service, and they were about to despair, when young Wormwood, who had been absent, came forward and offereA/to bear the message himself. His family, are of some wealth and dis- tinction in the place; and he was a great favorite with his father, who antici- pated ia deal of pleasure in the prospect of his future advancement. He pos- sessed: a fine manly figure, tall and very handsome, and as he sat on his      horse, the heart of many a maiden panted with admiration at the elegance of his bearing."   ' "Poor Janet? interrupted Mrs. Wells; "that alone was not what capti- vated her. He handthe gentlest manners, the sweetest disposition, the kindest heart of any man I ever knew!" "No wonder, then, the young woman was captivated," said Mrs. Monroe, wiping her eyes with the corner of her apron. ': It is a great temptation to a young maid's heart th have a fine gallant fellow occasionally seeking her society." "Mistress Monroe! Mistress Monroe!" ejaculated the Dominic, looking round upon his spouse with astonishment. "I say, Lieutenant Wormwood accepted the mission," resumed Mr. Wells, scarcely noticing the interruption; " and saddling his horse, off he rode through the forest to bring us the information that an attack was meditated upon our settlement, and that Colonel Klock's .regiment would be ready to march to our assistance the following morning. I was standing in front of my own door when he arrived in the village, and to me lie first communicated the in- telligence of which ble was the bearer.  All necessary stetps were at once taken sa  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7034-00000054"/> J 106         REBELS  AND  TORIES. to spread the news throughout the settlement. He was able to stay but a short time with us; took some refreshment at my house, and toward evening, he ordered his horse to be brought, and left us on his return to Palatine." "It is a pitiful story," again interrupted Mrs. Wells, striving against the tears which forced themselves into her eyes in spite of her contrary efforts. "It is a pitiful story; and I can see the young gentleman, as it were but yes- terday, as he sat in his saddle at the door, bidding us good bye, and telling us to keep cheerful hearts. How finely he was dressed; how jauntily and bravely he sat, how bold and handsome he looked, and how sweetly he smiled as he took poor Jane by the hand, kissing it and bidding her be of good cheer until he saw her again. And he was dressed all in a suit of ash-colored vel- vet, richly and tastily trimmed, and the long feather in his cap waved like an eagle's plume, and his good sword hung as though self-confident it was in honorable company, and his glossy locks flaunted with thethreeze that played so lovingly with them, and his right white hand, ungloved to give the parting salutation, felt shy of the dimpled joints and tapering fingers peeping from neath the snow-white ruffle of the wrist; and the spurs upon his heels shone as brightly as those of the knights we read of in old romance! In faith! I think he was a sort of revived specimen of the chivalric noble of a past age, just to give us a sample of a fine gentleman, honorable and brave. And yet with this multitude of noble qualities, he seemed all the while just as uncon- scious of them, as the child that is born blind; or like the dog, who has no more motive for being faithful, than to be faithful!-a strange simile. But I am getting warm with my subject, sir, and yet you must excuse me, for the original of my portrait being gone, we shall never see him more, so we need not neglect to praise the dead for fear of flattery, for they, lying cold and too often forgotten, need some one to speak of their virtues, if only as examples of goodness to those who live!" "Good faith!" my dear lady," exclaimed Mr. Monroe, "your discourse almost tempts one to be in love with death, if it were only for the sake of hav- ing you speak well of him when dead." "The lieutenant rode away, but ere he went he took occasion to assure us that he should be back again the following morning with the militia. He' rode away, sir, and there was not an eye in the village, old or young, that did not follow him, as he departed, with blessings. It is a great thing to be beloved, you may depend upon. It is a proud and grateful feeling to know that you are beloved by every one-to be always full of good acts, and to know that in your own necessities, there will always be found hands- out- stretched to give you cheerful aid. It must be a blessed feeling-like an assurance of God's own love! and after all, for his infinite mercies to ourselves we can only repay the debt by doing good to, and loving, our fellow-creatures. But I am talking you tired. Excuse me for a little. I said that every eye followed the lieutenant as he departed; and when the crest of a hill, in the direction of the Tekaharawa, hid him from our view. it seemed as though we all felt like mariners upon a desolate wreck in mid-ocean when the last sun goes down upon them. But I beg my husband's pardon for interrupting him."   REBELS   AND  TORIES.          107 "You may as well proceed, my dear," said lie; 'you have done the sub- ject better justice than I could have done it." "At any rate," said Mrs. Wells, as the sterner portions of the narrative are now to come, I think you will relate them better than myself." "Agreed," said Mr. Wells.. "I shall then follow the young lieutenant from the place where you left him, to the unfortunate end of hisjourney." ' When Wormwood left the village, he put his horse to pretty good speed, for he had a long distance to ride, and it was getting late in the afternoon. As Mistress W. says, the lieutenant had secured the attachment of every one in the settlement, as he was sure to do that of all who came in contact with him; and so, when we could no longer see him, we still listened for the sound of his horse's flying footsteps. I had forgotten to mention that he Was accom- panied from the village by Peter Sitz, who had been sent out as bearer of dispatches. Well, as I tell you, we listened and listened to the clattering of their horses' hoofs, till they could be no longer heard, for we felt an undefined dread of something-a presentiment of wrongs that seemed spitefully to min- gle with our anxiety for the welfare of our two friends. We could hear no longer, however, and were turning away to our several occupations, when our ears were startled by the report of musketry in the direction in which the two young men departed. Report after report followed, and in a few minutes more we were startled by a horse approaching the village at full speed, and as he flew past us we recognised him as Lieutenant Wormwood's, and the  saddle was crimsoned with human gore!" "-Horrible.! horrible!" exclaimed simultaneously both the Dominic and his wife; whilo a shudder passed over Arline, and an inaudible exclamation of terror died upon her lips. Mr. W. continued: "The most dreadful suspicions flashed upon the minds of all, and a party was immediately formed to proceed at once to the investigation of the affair. 'But for the whole of that night it remained a mystery, the men having re- turned without any success. Early the following morning another party was dispatceed, and in a short time the body of Lieutenant Wormwood was found, scalped and without a sign of life. It was a wild and fearful place where the deed was performed-just the spot that would be chosen for the enactment of some horrid revenge. It now seems that on the day on which the lieutenant was killed, Brant had been reconnoitering the settlement, and had selected as his place of ambush a spot near the road that leads to the Mohawk. But a little way from where the chief lay concealed, the road winds round the edge of .fearful chasm, of more than one hundred feet in depth; and this place be- ing overhung with shrubbery and evergreens, renders it almost dark, even in the light of day. Over this cliff rushes a mountain torrent, giving additional wildness to the savage grandeur of the place, which the Indians have chris- tened Tekaharawa. Here fell the gallant soldier! here fell our friend! What could we do but mourn, as we sent the mutilated remains to that home from which he had so recently departed full of vigorous health and hope. How- ever, 'twas all the office, we could render him, and you may be certain that all who knew him lamented his fate with heartfelt sincerity." ,                                        4  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7034-00000055"/> 108         REBELS   AND  TORIES. "Let us believe," said Mr. Monroe, '"that you mourn not as those who mourn without hope." "Sitz, the lieutenant's companion," continued Mr. Wells, " was made pris- oner. but his dispatches being double, he took care to destroy the true ones, so that the enemy became possessed only of such as deceived them. But Brant acknowledged that he scalped his victim-I suspect that he killed him; therefore what advantage has civilization been to this savage, if, with what else he has learned, he has neglected the culture of this principle-that the ties of friendship are sacred. That they were friends-the victor and the victim-none in this settlement or in Palatine will deny. Their friendship was too openly avowed to be disputed; but with what sense of delicacy he could take that friend's scalp for a trophy, even if he did not slay him, I shall leave to be answered by some one else ttan a savage. I will leave to others to make still greater complaints against the Mohawk Chieftain; I shall select that act alone, for which I can find no justification. Not slain in battle, but waylaid and murdered by savages in ambush, is an act to be judged of by a tribunal higher than earthly." "I sympathise with you in the young mai's loss, my friend," said Mr. Monroe; "but I am afraid you strain the point too hard,. and expect as nice a sense of the moral law in an uncultivated savage as in the more refined classes of our own nation." "But you must remember," said Mr. Wells, " that Joseph Brant in no common savage. He has had many of the advantages of education; has been in constant intercourse with many of the first men in the country, and has visited England, and there mingled with her statesmen, studied the customs of the people, in the meantime learning to avail himself of many of the con- veniences of civilization, if he has not learned any of its great moral prin- ciples." "I don't know but you are right," observed -the clergyman, "but at the same time we must allow the savage the privilege of fighting in his own way, and according to the principles of his nation, while we must. not forget that our so-called civilization has committed as great outrages against this heathen people as any with which we can charge them. Their simplicity in the first place has been taken advantage of all principles of honor in our dealings with them often violated, their lands violently wrested from them, till, driven from covert to covert, they have been forced to turn, like beasts at bay, in resist- ance to the avaricious and tyrannical spirit of the white man. In fact, they have been betrayed, debased and robbed by the very people whose popular boast is civilization. How can we so much blame them, then, if they at times retali- ate, and we find ' the ingredients of the poisoned chalice held to our own lips.' No, no, bad and brutal as the poor savage naturally is, there is no denying but that he has been made worse by examples which we have set him; and it should be our duty, as Christian brethren, to continually pray for, rather than harass him. We must blush to acknowledge that the French Jesuits knew better how to deal with him than ourselves, however much we may deny their religious sentiments."   REBELS   AND  TORIES.          109 How much further the argument between the Dominic and Mr. Wells inght have been carried, to the sacrifice of our readers' patience, had it not been for an opportune arrival, it is impossible to say; but as the latter ceased speaking, the whole party were surprised by the appearance of a horseman, who. turning a corner of the road near the house, passed in front of them, and asked with tolerable politeness, if it were possible for him to obtain a glass of water or milk to quench his thirst. At the sound of his voice, all eyes were turned upon him, and he was at once recognised as a familiar acquaintance by Mr. Monroe, his good lady and Arline, though to the Wellses he was an en- entirc stranger. Mrs. Monroe was the first to break the silence of the group, exclaiming, as she pulled off her spectacles, "As I live, and have my senses, if that is not Ralph Upton!" "Indeed it is, my dear," said her husband; "and I could not believe my eyes when I first recognised him; but in fact it must verily be himself and no one else. Why, my lad, what good or bad fortune has occurred that you should so soon follow us into this far country?" Arline had recognised him, perhaps sooner than either of the others, and her cheeks were suffused with deep blushes as their eyes met; and she listened eagerly for the answer which he would make to the clergyman's question. She feared that he came upon no good or wise errand, though she blamed herself for attempting to put a bad construction upon the motives of his journey. "Well, sir," answered Upton, "I had tired of the city, and longed for ad-  venture, so 1, even on the point of a suddi resolution, bethought me to visit some of the new settlements in this section of the country; and so travelling this way, and being in the neighborhood of Cherry Valley, I assumed the liberty of a previous acquaintance to call upon yourself and the ladies." "We are obliged to you for thinking of us," said the clergyman; "but 1 am afraid you will find troublesome times in these parts, and will soon miss and regret the security of the city." "Nevertheless," replied the young man, " it will be no more for myself than fo; hundreds of others who take up their abode in the wilderness." "I see you are determined, and so God prosper you in all that is proper and honest in your seeking. But have you ridden far I am sure you must want rest and refreshment, so turn out your beast into yonder field and come in, and we will then see what comforts we have for your stomach." Thanking the clergyman for his hospitable manner, he threw off at the door a small valise, and proceeded with his horse to the field indicated by his host. As he turned away, the eyes of Mr. Wells, which had been closely studying the young man's countenance, turned to Mr. Monroe with an expres- sion of inquiry which the latter understood. "That is a young man with whom I became acquainted in the city. He is by trade a carpenter; but has been more in the habit of making houses for the dead than for the living. Recently he has performed the duties of sexton, having succeeded in that office an eccentric old man belonging to my own parish, whom you have previously heard me speak of-the protector and guardian of Arline, to whom at his death he left a snug little property. You  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7034-00000056"/> "O         REBELS AND TORIES. see she has retire, probably from the reason that his presence revived un- pleasant and painful remembrances." "This, then," said Mr. Wells, "is the person that 'was the companion in the boat with the young man Rowley;whom I have also heard you speak of?" The clergyman answered in the affirmative. In fact, though he had been in the settlement but a few days, he had given Mr Wells, with whom he had become almost immediately intimate, most of the leading particulars of his life; and as Arline had at first been taken for his daughter, he was also obliged, in order to explain the relations between them, to relate all that he knew of the young woman's history, not omitting, of course, those most im- portant events of her life-the loss of her first benefactor, her connection with Rowley, and the sudden and somewhat mysterious death of her lover. These incidents ran rapidly through the memory of Mr. Wells. as he reviewed the countenance of Upton while he sat on his horse before them. "I am at a loss to imagine what has brought him out here," continued the clergyman; " though I fear for no conscientious purpose. In New York, by those who know him most intimately, it is more than suspected that he is in the interest of the British in the capacity of spy or informer, though no one, as I believe, has, up to this time, publicly accused him." "Then it will be our duty to keep a watch upon his actions, if in that ca- pacity he visits this settlement. We have enough of that sort about us already without going to the trouble of importing from other communities. I misjudged the young man wonderfully, if, from my study of his counte- nance while speaking with you, I lve formed a wrong opinion. It will not always do to form our estimate of character from physiognomical observa- tions; but there are faces that serve as pretty sure indexes, and I should take his to be one of that class." "I hope you misjudge him," replied the clergyman; "but I am willing to acknowledge that there has always been to me an inexplicable mystery about him, though further than that, I don't know anything that I can accuse him of. But he i returning: let us change the subject." "Let us drop it," observed Mr. Wells. "I see that the ladies have retired to the house. I will callmy wife and go home, and you and your good lady must return this short visit as early as you can make it agreeable. You have many things, probably, to say to your guest, that would be uninteresting or improper for me to hear; and to be candid with you, there is a power of re- pulsion between us that would render an interview unpleasant." "Well," said the clergyman, smiling, ."you are a bit of a philosopher, Mr. Wells; and being such, of course you must be humored more than ordinary men." The two friends goodnaturedly shook hands; Mrs. Wells took an affection- ate leave of Mrs. Monroe and Arline, and the kind-hearted neighbors de- parted to their own home, meeting Upton a few rods from the door, with whom they merely exchanged a formal bow of recognition, though there was a slight curl on Upton's lip to indicate that the dislike formed at first sight was mutual betwixt himself and the cold stern man who had just departed. But he passed on, and was met at the threshold of the door by the benevolent   REBELS   AND  TORIES.          1" and kind-hearted clergyman with many assurances of welcome, and was ushered into the house where he was received by Mrs. Monroe and Arline with a civility and politeness that awed him. CHAPTER XXI. TWO KNAVES AND A PLOT. RUMORS now began to reach the inhabitants of Cherry Valley, of Indian and tory outrages in the adjoining settlements; and no inconsiderable excite- ment prevailed, owing'to the discovery that two emissaries of the British had been found among the American soldiers in Fort Schuyler. They had for- merly been American soldiers, but made prisoners by the English, and liber- ated by Sir Henry Clinton on condition that they would re-enlist in the Amer- ican army in the capacity of spies, and otherwise use their influence to induce soldiers to desert, particularly Irishmen. For a long time their designs worked admirably-several parties deserting to the enemy. But the suspicions of Colonel Gansevoort, commanding at Fort Schuyler, being at length excited, he ordered them to be watched, and deputed a sergeant by the name of Kar- tele to ingratiate himself into the confidence of one of them, which service was so successfully performed, that he was enabled to elicit from them the whole object of their commission; whereupon one of them, by the name of Geake, was arrested, and on his examination before a court-martial, probably for the purpose of mitigating the punishment so justly due him, he made a full con- fession, and, with his confederates, was sentenced to be executed; though Geake was respited, in order that his testimony might be used against others whom it was desirous to secure. These circumstances becoming widely known, it induced the commanders of our military stations to be more than ever watchful and vigilant; and to the suspicions already excited in the minds of the clergyman and Mr. Wells against Upton. it added a determination, more particularly on the part of Mr. Wells, to keep a watchful eye upon the movements of the young man; but their apprehensions in that quarter were unnecessary, as the object of them was concocting schemes of far differcnt policy. It is true, he was often absent for days together, wandering no one knew whither, and he never took the trouble to enlighten any one respecting his transactions. He did not seem to care for the society of any person in the village, with the exception of Arline's, and this he sought as often as he could; and though his presence was not par- ticularly agreeable to her, she had too much real good nature to treat him oth*rwise than civilly; besides, aware of the prejudices against him, which in the simplicity of her nature she thought unjust, she felt a sympathy for him, which, probably, would never have been excited under other circumstances. The manner of Rowley's death she believed had been faithfully described by Upton, and with the testimony of the sailors who rescued the survivor from the water, left no room in her minid for suspicion of foul play. -There was no  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7034-00000057"/> "2         REBELS   AND  TORIES. motive that she could imagine for it; and if ever the thought for a moment flashed upon her mind, it was as instantly dismissed as unworthy of her. There was a melancholy association, it is true, connected with his presence, but in that fact she saw no reason why he should not be treated as respect- fully as any one else. Thits, although the clergyman and his wife suspected that his presence in the Valley had more to do with Arline than they were willing openly to express, they were pursuing, unwittingly, the very course to render them more intimate. Not that they considered it their right to inter- fere any further than the most disinterested motives would dictate, or that they believed she could be induced to listen for a moment to any liberties of speech on his part. But he was just so rude and uncouth as to suppose that her attachment toRowley was but a trivial affair, and soon forgotten; and that being without a natural protector, se might easily be persuaded to give a willing ear to his suit, when on some favorable occasion he should proclaim it. There are individuals, we know, whose perceptions of delicacy are so obscure that they never can understand what is meant by refinement of soul, and are constantly committing some new outrage against the best harmonies of our nature; and when to these sluggish perceptions id added a reckless regard of the moral principles that govern society, as well as the world, we have all the necessary ingredients to make a villain. Such was the condition of Upton. Is it necessary to describe him further? There is nothing strange, then, in any sacrilege he may commit against the conventional rules of de- cency even; and we must class lim among those sagacious animals that can be taught the extraordinary tricks of the menagery, but yet are obnoxious beasts after alltha said and done. Perhaps, in soae respects, Upton had formed a correct opinion of Arline. To understand this, it must be remembered that the intimacy between herself and Rowley was but of short duration. She had scarcely more than spoken civilly to him once or twice previous to the death of the old sexton; and the sympathy te expressed for her at the grave grew into intimacy, and that into an attachment warmer than friendship. In the hearts of the young the torch of Love is easily and quickly lighted; and if not suffered to burn too long, is as easily extinguished. In the first place, Arline lamented the fate of Row- ley, as one who had been kind to her in her affliction and desolation, and who had spoken to her the first words of comfort and consolation; secondly, she mourned him as a true heart would sorrow over the fate of any one so pre- maturely cut off in the bloom of youth and promise; and thirdly, she wept for him as a young maiden weeps for the loss of her first love; but the tears she shed were the April showers of the soul-spring showers that fall, pro- ducing an abundance of lovely things. Poor Rowley! there were roses flung upon thy grave, but they shall be no more renewed; and thy spirit, circling the wide arc of space, can only poise its wings an instant over the green sward and humble head-stone that marks the place where rests all that earth has left of thee! Alas I how we run to rhapsody and forget our veritable history! But we merely wanted to illustrate the fact, that the dead are apt to be too soon forgotten in our regard for the living; and possibly it is just that it is so, else,   REBELS AND TORIES.             113 entombing with our friends that die, all our regard for the living world about us, we become but little better than " stocks of stone or wood." Now, however, that we have defined the relative positions of Arline and Upton to each other, let us proceed to the unravelment of the plot. It was now about the close of August, and the inhabitants were in a con- tinual state of terror respecting the reports of numerous Indian outrages. Brant still hovered around the neighborhood, and each settlement felt its own fate insecure, alarmed by the daily-expectation of an onslaught from the savage hordes of Indians and Tories. The settlement of Andrustown, but a few weeks previous had been laid waste, its inhabitants slain or carried into captivity, everything of value removed, and the houses burnt. On the receipt of the intelligence, a party from German Flatts went in pursuit, but were unable to overtake the ravagers, and therefore took their revenge by burning and plundering the houses of two prominent Tories. One thing in a measure tended to allay the apprehensions of the residents in Cherry Valley, which was, that a number of its inhabitants were friends of, or personally known to Brant, and it was hoped from this reason, that they would be spared. We shall see in the end how far these anticipations were verified. While these events were transpiring, Upton occupied his time in going from and returning to the settlement, and always so confidently, as regarded his personal safety, as to more than ever confirm the suspicions of Mr. Wells; but he could detect him in no act that would serve to fasten upon him the charge of being a spy or emissary. But what was more disagreeable than all to the parties concerned, was the fact that each day he grew more and more in the confidence of Arline, so that at length she had consented to accompany him in short walks about the pleasant places of the village. She was blamed for it poor girl! though she acted from the best of motives-a willingness always to oblige when it was in her power-from the same principle that she would have walked with any one else. The purest persons are ever the least suspicious. Now be it known, that in spite of the shrewdness and watchfulness of Mr. Wells, Upton had a visiting place but a few miles from the settlement-a common place of resort for British officers, Tories, and the principal chiefs of the Indian tribes. This was a log hut situated a few yards from the Mohawk road, and completely surrounded by lofty trees and evergreens, so as to effectually screen it from the gaze of the curious, unless led thither by accident or on business. Its tenant was a man by the name of Newberry-as notorious for his many crimes as for his tory principles. There was no service too desperate for him to undertake-no act of brutality that he shrank from per- forning; and many a golden piece had gone into his greasy pockets from the fingers of British officers, for duties as purveyor-general to their lusty appe- tites, or for acting as spy or informer against the vile rebels, or any other wicked business which they might call upon him to perform-a sort of Jack- of-all-trades, from pimp to assassin. Now Upton, as you may have perceived, was no fool, though a knave; and in visiting Newberry, he had been shrewd enough to perceive that he had found a very proper man to assist him in completing a villany already concocted; 8  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7034-00000058"/> "4         REBELS  AND  TORIES. neither lacked he the means of temptation, for he had been clever enough, during the last five or six years of his life to amass enough to buy about half a score of rascals, each more respectable than Newberry. We shall see that he had not made his visit to Cherry Valley for no purpose. One afternoon, when he thought he should least attract the attention of the inhabitants, he mounted his horse and trotted off in the direction of the Teka- harawa. Pausing there a while to observe the scenery around him, as well as for the purpose of withdrawing any suspicion from his movements, in case he should have been watched, he took the main road leading toward the Mohawk, and trotting off at a pretty fast gait, he soon arrived opposite the hit of New- berry, which was indicated by a blared tree. Here he dismounted, and leading his horse in a circuitous direction through thick-standing trees, in a few minutes appeared before the door of the Tory. Newhury expected his vis- itor, and witha vulgar salutation greeted him welcome, after which he said: "Well, youngster, I am glad to see you. IIitch your horse, and tell me what you are after now-or have you come with more reports for Brant." "I come this time for no information, nor with any information, but to ask your ssistance in a transaction of my own." "Hem!" half growled the Tory. 'Spose in that case you come with the dockements?" "'I have learned too much of you to expect your services without good guerdon." "Sensible, sensible, young man. You see one mustn't be too obleeging, or he'd never have no time to do nothing for hisself." "You have great tact in speaking to the point," smilingly remarked Upton. "A nack you must learn yourself, if you ever mean to prosper in this world by honesty." "Honesty! exclaimed Upton." They both laughed, and the word was repeated by the Tory in a hoarse chuckle that startled the young man. "And now to business, said Newberry. What about the gal?" "I have made up my mind to do what I hinted at the last time I was here," said Upton. "And won't the critter talk?" "Talk enough about the trees, and the flowers, and the running brooks, and the birds, and the everlasting Bible." "That's bad!" exclaimed Newberry. "The Bible is bad for a sartainty. I never have nothing to do with that; it goes too much aginst me." "Well, it-wont hurt her much," observed Upton. "If she gets no worse notions in her head, I won't pretend to grumble." "But it won't be very agreeable, youngster, will it-to have her smacking it at you all the time, and you pulling ,tother way jist as hard?" "But by and bye she may have no' Bible to talk from, if I succeed," said Upton. "She's got it by heart, though, and she'll bother you there a little. But no matter-if you've got any spunk. that needn't trouble you. Have you tried her any on the 'fections?"   REBELS AND    TORIES.         115 "No! 1 have watched every opportunity to broach the subject to her, but as soon as I approach, she flies off at a tangent and launches out into some one of her favorite topics." "Aint you two much in a hurry, young man?" asked Newberry. ' You say it aint two months since she lost her lover can you expect the critter to get hot and cold and, hot agin in the same breath? Act like a gentleman, and give her time; and if you've got .ny talent at all, she'll come right round in good season. Don't be too much in a hurry. Many a good job is spiled that way. You don't expect she's going to love you and marry you at ajump (o you? Why, I should expect to see her drowned lover in my bridal chamber the first night; then wouldn't there be a time for hollering mur- der, eh?"  * Saying this, the Tory clapped Upton on the back till he started with sur- prise, turned pale, and then red again to the temples. "Ah, ah!" exclaimed Newberry, "I don't wonder that you start, though there aint no ghosts, nor nothing unnatural about here. But only to think what a picture it would make to have the ghost of your bride's lover grin in your face after you had got snugly in bed!-'ticularly if he was a murdered lover-wouldn't that pile up the beauty, eh?" Upton was amazed as well as startled. lie suddenly turned to look his companion in the face, but he saw nothing there to make him suspect that the horrible sketch which he had just drawn was anything more than a draft upon the imagination. The associations connected with this fanciful flight of the Tory's were painfully appropriate; but his nerves enabled him in a mo- ment to resume his usual composure. Tapping the leg of his boot with his riding-whip, he said, with an affectation of impatience, "What was the question you asked me previous to this long rigmarole of nonsense which you have just uttered?" ' Well, by hokey! I forgot. Oh-I asked you if you didn't think you wern't too much in a hurry? Sometimes too much haste upsets the fat!" "To feeling and fastidious minds, I may seem in too much haste. But what have I to do with that? While I am looking at the fruit some other hand may pluck it. You may as well understand me at once. I confess that she rather dislikes me; I have no hope of winning her love; I know this eagerness of mine is in bad taste; yet I swear I will possess her. You don't know how far I have gone in this business. I do not intend to damn my soul for nothing. I cannot waste the time in useless ceremonies; and as 1 learn by village talk that some one already aspires to be her lover-who has once saved her from imminent peril-I have made up my mrind to a summary method of obtaining her." "What is this chap's name that you think is looking after the gal?" in- quired Newberry. "A fellow by thcpiame of Murphy, recently attached to Morgan's rifle men." "Whew!" whistled the Tory. "Then you'd better stand from under; for I'd jist as leave meet the devil himself, as meet that varmint on bad terms."

"If you are willing to assist me, say so at once, or refuse, for I have no time to lose." I'm glad yqu mentioned that fellow's name," said Newberry; "for I al- lers like to know my job, and charge accordingly. Now I will charge you ten dollars more for Murphy." "For what reason?" asked Upton. "Why, if he suspects me of having a hand in the business, it'll take more than that to fill up the bullet-holes he'll make in my body. I tell you he's a roarer when his back's up!" "Is he such a terrible animal?" asked Upton. ' Better keep out of the reach of his paws, ef you know when you're well off," replied the other. "Well, and how much for the entire job?" asked Upton. "How much will you give?" inquired Newberry.  "The price is yours-name it." "What do you think is fair?" "You know better than I, so speak at once, without further haggling," said Upton impatiently. !"It's a risky business," said Newberry; "and if we should get catched in it, the doctors would soon have us. What do you think its worth now, for fair?" "I'll give you twenty-five dollars for the job," said Upton.  "Wont do it!" ' Five to that." "Can't sarve." "Five more to that." "Look you, now, youngster, do you think I am a fool? If you must have the thing done, you must pay for it; if not, take your wares to some other shop." "But you are exorbitant." "I know I am. If people must have luxuries, they must pay for 'em. I can't fiddle for nothing, and let you do all the dancing. "You take advantage of me, having my secret. If I were to employ some one else, you might betray me." "Maybe-its onsartain. Try me." "I'd kill you if you were to." "If I gin you a chance. I don't b'leve you're too particular on them pints." "Well, well, assist me through in this business, and I'll pay you fifty dollars-easily made, I'm sure." "I'm glad you threatened me, I has my price for that too," said Newberry, smiling maliciously. "Ten dollars more for that, too, I suppose." "Oh dear, sir! dont you think t vallies my safety mFe than that? I want twenty-five dollars extra for that." "Would you rob me!" exclaimed Upton. "May be I would, if I could get a chance," replied the villain with provok- ing coolness.   REBELS AND   TORIES.          " 'c You know I must employ you, and so charge your own price. I could sacrifice you, were I so inclined." ' Not so easy, young man. You could not denounce me-that has been done fifty times already. You cannot betray me-I have friends to warn me of danger. But you have been jesting I suppose; so name the duties I am to perform, and pay me seventy-five dollars, hard silver or gold." "When the service is performed you shall have your pay." "Well, well, the terms are not bad at any rate; and if you are not up to your word, I can eksily balk you, now for your plan." " Listen, then. After dinner to-morrow I. shall walk out with her, she will not refuse me, for she delights to speak to me of the Bible and of the beauties of Christianity. Believing me a reckless, thoughtless fellow, she is imbued with the ambition to reform me, and she happily thinks that strolling among the scenes of nature, the trees, the hills, the valleys, the brooks, the meadows, the singing birds and blossoming flowers, they will all prove accessories to her praiseworthy endeavors. In the course of the day you must find some one to send into the village to borrow my horse-some descent person not recognised or suspected. With it. and one for yourself, you must meet me at the place designated about an hour before sunset, and have a strong and trusty companion with you." "But you have not told me where we are to find you, yet," remarked Newhury. "I am going to tell you now," continued Upton. "While we are out, I shall persuade her to walk in the direction of, and as far as the Falls of the Tekaharawa, a place that she has never visited, although she has heard descriptions of its beautiful scenery. It is but two days since I heard her express a desire to visit it, and I promised to be her companion. My greatest fear is that some one of the settlers will offer to accompany us. That, come to think of it, may be easily avoided. I will only at first propose a short stroll, till we have walked some distance in the direction of the falls, and then, as an after-thought, propose to extend it to that point." "My eyes, youngster! what a cap'n you would have made, if you'd been properly brought up," exclaimed Newberry with surprise. "You must look out to be punctual, and if she is any ways impatient, I will manage to detain her till you come up. As soon as you see us-first having reconnoitred to ascertain that no one is about-ride swiftly up to us, and take me, as it were by force, a prisoner. You must be very savage, and possibly the girl will faint; if she does so much the better. Having taken me you must bind my hands behind me, place the young woman on a horse, and pro- ceed at once to this place, and leave the rest to me." "You are a precious plotter," observed Newberry; " and if I wern't jest what I am in pint of reputation, I don't know but I might be a little jealous. It is a plot you ought to be proud of, and if it i. your first one, you stand a fine chance of rising, and might afford to pay a little handsome to the gentle- men that see you out in it. Only to think, if we should all be caught, what a pretty kettle of fish it would make. and not a word to say in 'pology."  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7034-00000060"/> "8         REBELS AND TORIES. "You continually live at hazard, and even in this place you are not safe an hour," said Upton. "Then why talk about the dangers of this expedition. when every act of your life is a violation of the law?" Oh, I'm not grumbling," said the tory, taking an enormous quid of to- bacco. "Honor is honor among gentlemen; and when I have gi'n my word for a bargain I sticks to it if I loses. So ride back to the settlement as quick as you please, and get all your plans in order; for now that I know my part of the business, I wants a little time to calculate on it. I must find a respect- ble person to borrow your horse. Let's see-s'pose I do it myself?" "Madness! what are you thinking about?" "No such thing, I tell you. I can disguise myseli like somebody else, and have done it frequently. i'm ip Cherry Valley oftener than they suspect." Well, but don't risk it this time." "Jest as you say. I now think of a person i can send, so be off, and leave me to calculate a little. as I said before. Do you mind being hurt a little when we take you?" "Just as little as you please." "A knock down or so-wouldn't it help along.?" "Omit as much of that as possible." "Well, away with you and leave me to my calculations. I expect you will make me a present if the job is well done?" "What, for knocking me down?" "If it's done handsomely, why not? But away with you I must cal- culate." Thus ended this interview, and Upton returned to the settlement with ex- cited hopes for the success of his villainous plot, and Newberry entered his hut to "calculate." CHAPTER XXII. A NEW ARIVAL, AND A NEW VERSION OF THE BATTLE Or ORISKANY. WltEN Upton returned to the clergyman's it was well advanced into the evening. His absence till so late an hour created no surprise, and he was  received on his entrance with unusual cordiality; but he was surprised to find, mingling with the family group, a person whose countenance he did not re- member to have seen before. The stranger, however, was introduced by Mr. Munroe, by the name of Murphy, and as they exchanged salutations, he found it difficult to return the full manly gaze of the rifleman. A recruit, I suppose, in our holy cause," said Murphy, grasping his hand. "I welcome you, sir, into these unsettled districts, for the times are getting so disturbed by the combinations of treacherous friends and open enemies, that we need every honest arm that comes to our assistance. Have you been long in these parts?" 9   REBELS   AND TORIES.           119 "But a few days," replied Upton. "Not long enough, then, to learn much of our customs," said Murphy. "Well, we will do our best you may depend upon it, to see you properly dril- led. You are from the cities, I suppose?" "From New-York." "Do the British there still fancy that they can crush the bold independent spirit of our countrymen?" "As sanguine as ever, I suspect, from the movements that I hear reported." "Well, time will test the strength of the opposing parties. But if there is justice above us, this accur ed tyranny of British misrule must be crushed by the heel of liberty. We-have had too much of it already; and the barbarities enacted by their mercenary troops, their savages, and the Tories have aroused a spirit among the American people, that. can only be extinguished by their complete annihilation. The English government cannot understand this spirit, or it would have given up the contest long ago." "The battle to the right always," said Upton, "and in the end such must be the result." "I am sure you speak truly," exclaimed Murphy, "I find our friends here considerably alarmed by the rumors of Ingin aggressions in the neighbor- hood." "Without cause, I hope," said Ipton, with real sincerity; for nothing he so much desired as that t hey should refuse to give much credence to the rumors that were afloat; and confidence in their security was necessary for the completion of his own designs. But in this man Murphy whom he had thus met, and whose name had been mentioned in his interview with Newberry, he saw what he feared would prove an insurmountable obstacle to the prompt fulfilment of his arrangements with the tory. A hundred times he wished him out of the way, or dead, or in any place but where he was, and gradually he grew abstracted in his efforts to imagine in what way to carry out his designs against Arline, should Murphy's presence in any way prove an impediment to his operations. He had no doubt but he should be obliged to seek Newberry on the following morning for the purpose of postponing the work so recently planned out between them. This alteration in his demeanor was observed by the clergyman, and perhaps, it somewhat confirmed him in  the suspicions which he had hinted to Mr. Wells. He was, however, a man  of unbounded charity, and never allowed his prejudices to operate against the interests of any one. He pade it a rule to require some evidence of wrong, stronger than mere distrust, before withdrawing his confidence from persons with whom he was acquainted.  The conversation was now mostly confined between Mr. Monroe and his new guest. with an occasional question or remark from Mistress Monroe or  Arlinc, which privilege their occupation (knitting winter stockings for the Dominie) happily did not debar them from. The rifleman was obliged to recount his adventures since they last met. Of the Wild Medicine he could give no account, except that when last heard from he was cutting up some of his mad pranks among the Onondagas, with as much impunity as ever. \ *  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7034-00000061"/> 120         REBELS AND TORIES. "By what privilege does he thus pass unharmed among so many bands of savages?" asked the clergyman. "Why, they consider him either crazy or a fool," said Murphy; "and that is a sort of carte-blanche, as the French call it, to their best society." "And which do you think he is?" asked Arline, looking up for an instant from her work. :' Neither, Miss," said Murphy. p Goodness conscience! I hope not," exclaimed Mrs. Monroe, as she drop- ped a stitch. "He is just as mad as a March hare. when he has a mind to be," resumed Murphy; '" but whoever takes him for a fool has found the wrong customer. 'He has had his enemies, marm, and in the course of his natural life some one -has done him a great injury; and when he thinks of these .things, he git right on end like a white b'ar."  "Iie talks wonderful strange sometimes," observed Mrs. Monroe. "Indeed we all do, marm, particularly if we get a little mad. , But I have seen the Wild Medicine as calm as a June morning, and then he would talk to you for an hour like a lawyer; and again I've seen him foaming like a roaring torrent in a freshet, when nothing could seem to stand against him. If you had seen him in the desperate bloody battle as I have, you would have a sort of reverence for him you couldn't help. We have stood together in the hottest of it, back to back, and lodged together many a night in the black gloom of the forest, with no music for our lullaby but the yelling of the devilish wild Ingins. The Wild Medicine and I are sworn friends, you may depend on't; And it wouldn't be well for either of us to meet treachery, if the other knew of it." "Has he no other name than the Wild Medicine?" asked Arline. "Not as I know on, Miss. You see that is a name the Ingins gin him, and nobody knows any other. It's good enough, though." "At least," said Mr. Monroe, "we owe him, together with yourself, many, many obligations which we never can repay. Such good acts I hope pave a good distance of the way to Heaven." ;' You will please to say nothing of that, for we were only doing our duty. Ah, I can tell you, sir. that these infernal red skins want another Herkimer to give them a few lessons. He was the best general for that business we ever had in this part of the county jand I'm thinking that he might have been alive yet had it not been for the obstinacy, or stupidity, or cowardice of some of his officers. Cowardice! it wern't nothing else, to run away and let the brave old man fight it out himself, with the few faithful hearts that stuck to him. Never shall I forget that day, though I was but a volunteer on a small scale, and for a particular' purpose." "You knew the general then," said Mr. Monroe. "Yes; and a good many hard scrimmages I've seen him in," replied Mur- phy. '"In five minutes after we got to fighting on our first battle together, I felt as though I had known him all my life." "I knew him very well," said Mr. Monroe; ' and was glad to learn that he V   REBELS AND    TORIES.          121 died likes a Christian. He always called upon me when he came to the city, and we were intimate for many years. I am told that the last time he visited this settlement he slept beneath this roof." ('Do you say so!" exclaimed Murphy. ;' Then will you be so kind as to let me spend the'night in the same room. I'm an awkward fellow, and don't know much about the ceremonies of society; but I hope I have not been rude in making 'the request. But you don't know how much good it would do me; and I somehow think it would make me braver the next engage- ment I am in." "Well, I will grant you your request on one condition," said the clergy- man. "I have never yet seen any authenticated or official account of the battle of Oriskany and the death of my friend; and to hear it from the lips of one who was his companion on that unfortunate field, is a pleasure I would not willingly forego. I am sure that Mistress M. would be equally gratified, as she esteemed the general very highly,and Arline will not be a dull listener from the fact that she has so often heard us speak of him. But I must be as polite as yourself, and ask you to excuse me if my request is rude." ' Well, my friends, my principal objection to telling you about the general's death is. that I am afraid that I should be induced to blow my own trumpet too much, a custom that I am not very favorable to. However, to oblige you, and dispensing with as much mock-modesty as possible, here's what I know of the battle of Oriskany." The ladies now laid aside their knitting-work, and even Upton roused him- self from his moody position in a far corner of the room. But before Mur- phy commenced his account of the battle, it is necessary that we should pref- ace it with a few preliminary observations;, in order that the reader may have a more perfect sketch. In the summer of 1777, Colonel Barry St. Leger was dispatched from Mou- treal, to form a junction at Oswego with Sir John Johnson and Brant, for the subjugation of the inhabitants of the Mohawk Valley and vicinity. Tlhe condition of Tryon County (now Herkimer) at the time was considered by Washington, and some of his most eminent generals, as alarming in an immi- nent degree; the citizens standing in continual fear of the Tories and Indians. Fort Schuyler was in almost a defenceless condition, and in spite of all the extraordinary efforts of General Schuyler, it was with the utmost difficulty that troops could be mustered for the garrison of the place. In view of this state of things, a proclamation was issued on the 17th July, by General Herki- mer, calling upon all persons from. sixteen to sixty years of age, to enrol themselves for actult service. In the mean time the Indians, becoming more confident, committed many outrages against the inhabitants, and even the soldiers dared not venture abroad except in large parties. At length the forces under St. Leger, consisting of British regulars, Hessians, Tories, and Indians, arrived in the neighborhood. and on the'3d of August invested the fort-the commander sending a flag injto the place, with a proc- lamation condemning in unmeasured terms the rebellion. and offering the pro- tection of British arms to such as should abstain from disloyal acts. No ooner was this known to the Try\on Co nt v (commllittee of offi'es, thaln Gene-  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7034-00000062"/> REBELS   AND  TORIES. ral Herkimer, at the head of from eight hundred to a thousand men, moved from Fort Dayton to 'the succor of the garrison. On the 5th of August, he encamped at Oriskany, and sent forward an express to Colonel Ganesvoort, \ who was in command of the fort, to apprise him of his approach, and to con- cert means of co-operation. Owing to delays, the messengers did not reach the fort till late the next morning, and their arrival was to be acknowledged by three successive discharges of cannon, the general supposing the report of the pieces could be heard in his own camp, eight miles distant, his object be- ing to force a passage to the fort'; and to facilitate this movement, Ganes- voort was to order a sally to be made by two hundred men, with an iron three-pounder, under Colonel Willett,* What here follows, and the result of the battle we prefer to let Murphy tell his own way. I-,MURPHY'S ACCOUN'r OF THE BA'"TTLE OF ORISKANY. Well, said Murphy, I had just been out on a reconoitering expedition among the Iroquois-for you must know that I have a sort of knack of cir- culating among them more than they think for, when. on returning I fell upon the camp of the brave old Herkimer, at Oriskany. I found him sur- rounded by his principal officers, among whom were Colonels Visscher, Klock, and Paris, Major Clyde, and the cowardly Cox. You see I respected the old general, so I saluted him as handsomely as I could, and stood back a little to watch things, for I saw they were not going quite straight, though I didn't say anything.- Herkimer was talking to 'em like a book, though. "Gentlemen," said he (and when he looked at you, you could see that he had eyes that were made for something), "Gentlemen, I doubt the expediency of any further movements without reinforcements. We shall find the enemy strong in their advance, and we must have men enough to keep out .scouting parties on our flanks, to prevent surprise by bodies of Iroquois in ambush." Then up spoke Colonel Cox-the mutineering sarpent. "With due respect to your judgment, general," said he, "I can see nothing to gain by lying here for reinforcements which may never come; and as for scouting parties, I think your apprehensions of an ambush are dictated by too great a regard for personal safety." There warn't much " due respect" in that, I take it; and if I'd been gene- ral, I'd had him shot without court-martial. Then out spoke the general like a true soul as he was: "Dictated by a sense of caution, sir, which every commander must feel who has the safety of his troops and the success of his enterprise at heart!" "Why not move on at once, then?" said Colonel Paris, another traitor. "Nothing can be gained vby this delay, unless giving the enemy time to sur- prise us here, while we are debating whether we are to fight or run away." I tell you that the old manll spunked up a little at this, I saw his face turn red; but he did better than I could have done, and answered mildly: * Not attempted, however, owing to' heavy rain, until some time after the battle lad begun, and then with the most complete suecess.   REBELS AND    TORIES.           123 "I am afraid, gentlemen, that some of you will not need orders to take such steps to secure your own safety before the day is over." "At least," said Visscher," ': we are not so tainted with the blood of the Tory, as by our supineness, to give encouragement to the enemy, and dis- hearten our own troops." I reared up at this like thunder. I had an everlasting mind to knock the fellow over the head with the breech of my rifle; but I held in, and I won- der at it now; but the general was a leetle wrothy by this time, and he said rather sharply, "Gentlemen, what do these imputations mean? Allow me to ask an ex- planation from some one of you." "Certainly--from all, if you please,'" said the impudent Cox. "It does not smack well of your zeal, this inactivity. The troops are discontented and murluring; and unless you soon decide upon some active policy, you must not be surprised to see them move on without their brave general." Madder and madder got the old man, and he said: "This is mutiny, gentlemen-insubordination, at least." "Call it what you please, general," said Paris, " we have an idea of our duty and the honor of the service." I looked that man right in the eye, and I saw he didn't at all like the looks of me. "This is rank injustice!" said the general, stamping his foot. ' This is base!--it is infamous! Have neither of you any regard for the men under your orders? Am I so young in experience as to be ignorant of my duty?" "' Whatever be your experience," said Cox, "you -take a strange way of showing it." Then the general spoke mild again, and persuading like, just as I wouldnl't have done. "We must be reinforced," said he; " we must send out scouting parties: in our present critical situation, everything must be avoided that hazards the safety of our little army. We have no men to spare for rash enterprises." a It is easy to see," said Cox, with a sneaking, insinuating way, turning to his companions, " that our brave general, besides lacking the nerve to meet danger, is failing in his fidelity to the cause of the country." Whew! I guess sparks fell among the powder that time. AMy! my! but I thought that the old general would have come right up out of his boots. He faced them all, as though he would look 'em through, and I saw 'elm quail and tremble before his awful eye! And my bristles were up too, a little, and I had to put my' hand over my mouth to keep still. I'd have given my natural sarvice for life to have pitched right in among 'era, ight and left!

Springing from his seat, and without uttering another word, the general was mounted before either of his base officers, and riding out in front of his  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7034-00000063"/> 124         REBELS  AND TORIES. troops, distinct and clear, like a bell, rang out his voice above the bustle of arms: "Forward-march!" and putting himself at ther head, the men moved forward with shouts, in files of two deep, flanked upon each side, and, preceded by an advanced guard. At this movement, the rebellious officers stood together in astonishment for a moment, and taking advantage of this opportunity, I rode up near enough for them to hear me (for I was well mounted at that time, though for the major part I do my fighting afoot) and I said to 'em: "Gentlemen, after this little skirmish is over, I should like' to meet you all as soon as convenient, and have a reconsideration of what you have been talking about." "And who are you?" .asked Cox. "Murphy the Riflemn!" said I; " and neither scart at wild Ingins nor traitors." They took th ir places, madam, precious quick. They'd heard of me and Tom, (thats my fie,) and they knew, as I was fighting on my own hook, that they could not do t  with me. But they were terrible angry at me and thought I took a mighty liberty, I guess, in speaking as I did. They knew I want afeard of the whole of 'em. I had made up my mind to have a reckon- ing with 'em for their treatment of the good old general, but circumstances in the run prevented me, as you shall see. Well, I guess the troops had been in motion about twenty minutes, and seeing that the general was riding alone, and mayhap wanted a friend, and being willing to volunteer, if there was going to be any fun, I just thought I'd ride up to him, and so I did, and as I touched my cap to him, he said: "Ah, Murphy! I am glad to see you. Are you going to volunteer in this affair?" "If you will allow me, general," said I; " but only in one capacity-that of a volunteer aid to yourself." "In any way you choose," said he; "for I know you are brave enough to do good work in any situation."  I could see by his manner that the talk with his officers was rankling in his bosom, and so I concluded to say nothing about it. Now you see, I had a double motive for volunteering; one I have already told you. The other was that I happened to know one of the officers belong- ing to the forces that would be opposed to him, who had been guilty of a great wrong to a friend of mine, who afterward fell at Ticonderoga; and I had made a vow to avenge him. His daughter had been seduced from her home by this wretch, and afterwards abandoned and left to perish. I had a presentiment that I should meet him, and so I told the general, with the rest of my story. After he had heard me out, he said: "I understand you, young man, but I don't approve the principle of revenge. You are welcome, however, to slay in battle an enemy of your country." ; I respect you, general," I said. "God save the country!"And then we rode on in silence for a half hour longer, for I saw that the general, brooding over the insults of his officers, was not in the mood for talking. T guess, as I said, we must have rode near a half hour longer, when thinking that I saw   REBELS AND TORIES.            125 sometliing move in a part of the forest made more dense by tlicket and un- derbrush, I whispered to Herkimer that I suspected we were near an ambus- cade, ' for " said I, "I am sure I heard the click of a gun-lock, and I am not often mistaken in such matters." And sure enough, before the necessary or- ders could be given, there was a mighty sharp cracking of musketry, and the guards both front and flank were shot down. I saw the column quiver for a moment, one or two of my valiant colonels turned pale a little, but cool as ice, the general gave instant orders to dislodge the foe, and push forward; but our balls had but little effect in silencing their fire, and accordingly we advanced until General Herkimer found himself entering a broad bottom, through which swept a ravine of a semi-circular form-impassable on account of its marshy character, except by means of a narrow causeway made with logs, and about fifteen feet wide. Here we found the enemy ready for us, in first rate position, consisting of a division of Sir John Johnson's regiment of Greens, under Major Watts, Colonel Butler with his Rangers, and a strong force of Ingins under Brant. These were arranged in such a manner as to draw our troops com- pletely within a circle, only leaving space enough open for their admittance, Brant and his Ingins taking possession of the surrounding heights. Before we were aware of it, Butler gave the order for the circle to be closed, by this movement completely surrounding our, forces, with the exception of the rear guard under Colonel Visscher, the baggage and ammunition wagon, and the re- giment of Colonel Cox, yet on the east side of the ravine-mark you, Colonel Cox's regiment. As soon as this stratagem was completed, the battle commenced in real ear- nest-the Ingins and Butler's Rangers pouring upon us a dreadful, murderous fire. From behind trees and logs, and rocks, and from every place of shelter, the devilish Ingins darted forth upon our men with knife and tomahawk; but yet, cool and courageous as lions, the men charged and re-charged without effect, and our numbers every minute became more and more thinned by the destructive fire of the enemy. But every where, at the head of his *roops rode the brave old Herkimer, and you may be sure I wan't far from him, though I'd a good deal rather my actions should speak than my words. But I may as well say, because I'm proud of it, that once or twice I saved the general from great peril. By and bye, says I to him i "Every man seems to fight well."  '"Where is Cox's regiment?" he asked, scarcely noticing my remark. I had just returned from carrying an order to Colonel Paris. "Flying, sir, said I, "as fast as they can, and with their colonel at their head." "I told him so!" exclaimed the general, while a gleam of joy for a minute brightened his eye. ' Ride over to Klock, and tell him to charge that bit of wood on his left." Away I went, jumping over the dead and the wounded, and the balls whist- ling around me like hail-stones. I delivered my message, saw the charge made, and hurried back to the general just in time to see him on the ground, his horse having been shot from under him, and his leg shattered by a four- pound shot.  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7034-00000064"/> 126  i       REBELS AND, TORIES. "For God's sake, general!" said I, ",what is the matter? Are you wounded?" "A bite;-a mere bite!" said he, casting a glance around him upon his troops. "Place me against that tree, facing the enemy. If I live we will fight them yet." I jumped to the ground and did as he directed, taking the saddle from his dying horse, and placing it under him for a seat. His position commanded a view of the principal points of the action, and as soon as I had made him as comfortable as possible, he took out of his pocket his tinder-box, and lighting his pipe, he commenced smoking, in the meantime giving out his orders with astonishing coolness. The battle went hard, though, and our men began to falter, when we were gladdened by hearing the concerted signal from the fort. All understood it, and no sooner did it reach the ears of the troops, than every heart bounded with joy and hope, and fresh vigor strengthened" the arm of every republican soldier in -the field. Then the old general's countenance brightened up, and he said, rubbing his hands: "If we can only hold out a short time longer, reinforcements from the garrison Will enable us to turn the tide of battle in our favor." He then told me to run down to Colonel Vis scher, and tell him to fight in more open order, as his men were too close together for the Ingin bullets. Sharp-shooters were stationed behind trees by the orders of the general; and seeing that the savages rushed forward to tomahawk them as soon as they had fired, he ordered two to be placed together, that one might reserve his fire for the cautious enemy as he approached. "That'll fix 'em!" said he with exultation. And so away I went pell-mell through the thickest of 'em, some- times picking out an enemy for myself; and at one'time, when stopped;by two Ingins, who wanted to pull me from my horse, I shot one with my pistol, and dashed out the brains of the other; but nothing didn't touch me-it some- times seems as though I was fire-proof, or charmed, or something or other. The fight went on beautifully for a spell, and some of our officers fell, and Butler's Rangers were doing splendid work among our rank and file. The air was filled with the infernal yells of Ingins, drowning almost the roar of the battle, and the general saw his men fall around him like leaves in autumn. Yet firm as an oak, preserving his coolness to the last, he sent me out with another order for the men to form in circles, to prevent the enemy, who were drawing in, from closing upon them. That was a great movement, and its success pleased him mightily; for no sooner was it effected, than the opera- tion of our arms began to be more decisive. Then the firing commenced to slack off. and the British tried what they could do with the bayonet; but they found as good stuff as themselves, and our thinned ranks met them with amazing firmness. I wouldn't have believed it, nor the general either, but it was a  sight to see-strong men falling all about you, but so contrary they wouldn't either give in nor complain. Well, I guess we came pretty near licking them. I  was going to say to the general that I guessed we had, when down came the rain, pouring like fun for an hour or so, and both sides drew off for a spell, and sheltered themselves as well as they could. While it was   REBELS   A-ND TORSES.          127 raining, General lIerkimer kept his eyes about him making observations, and presently he spied an unoccupied piece of ground that pleased him wonder- fully, and he ordered the men to take possession of it, and again form them- selves into circles. Well, by the time that we got everything fixed to suit us, the rain stopped, and the battle opened again in mighty earnest. But we had a leetle the ad- vantage thiis time, and were sending the cold lead among them in a leetle larger doses than they wanted to bargain for. I was biling' over for an oppor- tunity to rush in, but the situation of the general made it my duty to stand by him, for not being able to run about himself, he depended altogether upon me to carry his orders. He didn't complain of anything else. He never said a word about his pain, though I could see by his face at times that he was suffering dreadfully. It was a bloody strife that was now raging, and just as the enemy were about to give way, down came a reinforcement of Johnson's Greens.' Most of these men were loyalists, and had come from the same part of the country as many of our own men-many of 'em being neighbors, and the sight of 'em made those of our own ranks so crazy mad, that they fought more like wild tigers than human beings. I saw men from our own regiment, after discharg- ing their pieces, rush with their bayonets upon such as they recognised among the enemy, or dash out their brains with the buts of their muskets; and I saw men, too, where they throttled each other, and finished the bloody con- test with their knives! I had just come in from an order to Klock, and found the general much excited at the prospect of giving the enemy a sound drub- bing. While I was with Klock, Jacob Sammons--you must have heard of him-came in with the intelligence that a large body of men were approach- ing disguised to appear as American soldiers. from the direction of the fort. This I reported to the general. !"Hem! doubtful!" said he. ' Too soon-too soon! A trick of Butler's. On What point are they approaching?" I told him they were approaching the position occupied by a body of men mnder the command of Capt. Gardenier. "Good!" he exclaimed. "Ride down, then, to Gardenier as fast as you can-communicate my suspicions, and leave the rest to his judgment." I did as I was bidden, and found Gardenier in conversation with Sammons, who had already informed him that succors were approaching from the fort. Riding up to them, I delivered the general's orders to Gardenier, not forget- ting. of course, to add the complimentary remarks. This pleased him very much, and he at once coincided in that opinion. By this time the men were in sight. "By their hats, they are Americans," said Sammons. "Not so," said the captain. "Don't you see their green coats? It is a party of the Greens, who think to surprise us, but they'll be mistaken this time." The suspicious party had now approached so near that one of Gardeniers men stepped forward to grasp the hand of a supposed friend, when he was seized iand drawn within the ranks.  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7034-00000065"/> 128         REBELS  AND  TORIES. "Forward, men-charge!" shouted Gardenier; and at it they went, and in went I, too, this time. I forgot the general-I couldn't help it-I'll own it; but the temptation was too great, when I saw Gardenier pitch in as he did. You may as well believe I tripped up a few, and without a scratch myself. It is wonderful! I've often thought of it, and I do wonder what I was made for, if I aint to be killed! I'm sure I've taken my chance many a time. But I musn't talk much of myself, but tell you what a brave man did, and he wan't very large either. Well, I'll give you an idea what a man can do when he's got a mind to. As soon as Gardenier saw the man dragged into the enemy's ranks, he rushed forward and liberated him by dashing his captor to the earth. This was no sooner done, than he was set upon by three men; but they ought to have been ashamed of themselves, for quicker than I can tell you, he killed two of 'em and wounded the other, when he was set upon by more of 'em, who knocked him down and pinned him to the earth by sticking their bayo- nets through his arms, above the elbows. "Dreadful!" exclaimed Mrs. Monroe, while Arline started with a shudder. "War is a merciless trade," said the clergyman; " but God knows that our country was driven into it by the worst and basest oppression. What must be the responsibility of those who pushed it on!" "They had pinned the captain's arms to the earth, as I tell you," continued Murphy, ' and a bayonet was held at his breast to thrust him through, when he seized it, and with the gun which he wrenched from the soldier, defended himself until rescued by myself. Again he was assailed when retreating, and turning upon them with a spear, he killed a Lieutenant Macdonald, and thus rejoined his own men.* Sammons now cried out that we were charging our own men; but Gardenier knew better, and ordered them to charge the more furiously, which they did most heartily, driving the Greens inch by inch be- fore them, until at length they were joined by some Indians, when the con- test raged with terrible fierceness, and the yells of the combatants mingled wildly with the clash of arms. In every part of the field the battle now be- came terrific, from a belief on both sides that the termination was near, and from the mortal hatred which man bore to man, as he recognised in the op- posite faction some former friend or near neighbor. All this time I had not been able to recognise the enemy I was hunting for. I was sure he was en-- gaged somewhere, but I hadn't yet been able to place my eyes upon him. General Herkimer was still sitting upon his saddle, smoking his pipe, though suffering dreadfully from his wound, and he expressed the utmost confidence in the result of the battle. I had now taken up my station alto- gether by his side,'that position enabling me better than any other to watch for the man I sought. "Ah! that was well done!" said the general, as he observed a movement of Colonel Klock's men. "Now God help them! they must do their best. If I were but in the saddle, I chuld terminate this scene in ten minutes; but that is a useless regret. But for the shameful conduct of those rascally offi- * A strictly historical fact, though seemingly almost improbable. p   REBELS A   D TORIES.         129 cers, and their want of confidence in me, this would not have happened. I am to blame, though-I am toblame that I lost my temper; but I have done my best." "Nobody dare say to the contrary," said I; "' at least in my presence." "I thank you, Murphy," said he. "But for the cowardice of" - I anticipated what he was about to say; so, interrupting him, I said: "Sir, Colonel Cox has been slain; so are Captains Davis and Van Sluyck; and Colonel Paris and Major Frey are prisoners. There are many others, but these have come under my own notice." The old man paused for a minute-lie seemed affected; but the sore still rankled as he said: "Two of them charged me with cowardice. God forgive them! for they have gone to their account." Looking up he observed that my attention was directed to another part of the field, and' he asked me what I was looking at. I pointed out an officer nearly opposite us, who was riding carelessly over to his regiment, with a sort of a bullying defiance of our men's bullets. I asked him to give me a few moments leave, when I would return to him. He smiled, and asked me, in the manner of a joke, if I intended to desert, and I told him that I was only going to pluck the feathers of that fine bird. and bring him back his sword. "That is Captain Asham, with whom I have business," said I. lie told me to do just as I pleased, and assured me that he would watch me. So away I dashed after the fellow, as fast as my horse could carry me, and I guess I wan't a minute before I had hold of my gentleman's bridle. Now I will tell you what happened betwixt me and him jest as though it was written in a book. I rid right up to him. and says I, as soon as I had seized his bridle arm: "Not only your enemy as you strive against the soil of my birth-equally of your own; but your enemy for private injuries as deep and unpardonable." Then you should have heard him say in a loud voice- "Rebel and traitor! what means this violence?" and he struggled to release his arm, while with his left he endeavored to draw a pistol from his holster. : Unhand me, ruffian!" said he very fiercely. "You do not know me, I see," said I; ; but I remember you as the artful scoundrel who first seduced and then abandoned the daughter of my friend- Mary Wenham. For the first, you deserve the contempt of the world-for the second, I shall kill you!" He turned first white and then red, and being in sight of his men, he bawled loudly for a rescue, but the parties on the field were too much taken up with their own affairs to notice individual encounters, and so the captain warn't heard. I said to him-for I profess a conscience- "I will not murder you Captain Asham. but will treat you like a foe in battle. We will walk our horses apart till I can count ten, then wheel and fire. I own that I mean to kill you, and if you run from me, I will pursue and shoot you like a dog! Now go!" And so I pushed the captain's arm from me, and we walked our horses apart, but before I could count ten, I heard the report of a pistol, and a ball whistled past my ear. [ wheeled as quick as I could. and saw that my fine 9  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7034-00000066"/> 130         REBELS  AND  TORIES. captain was retreating at full speed toward the enemy's lines; so as quick as the flash of your eye, Miss, I unslung Tom-that is my rifle, there-and yelling a war-cry at him, I took a dead aim and fired. The captain only groaned once, and fell backward from his horse, and the brave animal fled frightened into the ranks of 'our own men. I was satisfied; so possessing myself of my enemy's sword, I rode back to join the general, though many a leaden messenger was sent after me. You see I'd a right to kill him, for I met him in the enemy's lines on a field of battle, and what is more than usual, I gave him a fair chance with myself. As soon as I had joined the general, he paid to me this compliment: "; Sir," said he, "you have done a very gallant act directly in the face of the enemy, and at the same time served two causes." I thanked him, and we now directed our attention to the situation of things on the field, and it was pretty evident that we were gaining a viotory, for the enemy were retiring before the galling fire of the militia; and the Ingins, feeling the destructiveness of that fire, and seeing the ardor with which we fought, began to yield, and in a few minutes afterward, raising their retreat- ing cry of "Oonah!" they fled in every direction. This. communicated a panic to the Greens and Rangers, and in spite of the threats and remon- strances of their officers, they also hastily retreated, leaving the field to our militia, after one of the bloodiest battles that it has beenkmy fortune to wit- ness, and I have seen some hard fighting, I reckon. Well, I haint got much more to tell, than you know already. General Herkimeres wound grew more and more painful, and at his request I accom- panied him home to his house near Little Falls, where his leg was cut off; but the doctor was a bunglar, and did more harm than good, and so the old general had to take up his line of march for other quarters; and when he was dead people began to find out how valuable an officer he was, and how good a man he was. And so I have finished my story.* Murphy's narrative seemed to gratify the clergyman and his wife, and proved not uninteresting to Arline; as for Upton, his attention was more taken up with the character of the narrator that the narration. He studied every movement of his features, every gesture that he made, and calculated his chances of success should it ever be his fortune to have a personal encounter with him; and we must acknowledge that his conclusions were un- satisfactory. It had now gotten to be late in the evening-that is, in the consideration of our sedate country-folks of that period, and a proposition to retire seeming acceptable to all parties, the clergyman, faithful to his promise, lighted Murphy to the room once occupied by General Herkimer, wishing him quiet slumber and happy dreams; and in a few minutes longer the house was still, and Upton had retired to his solitary room to meditate upon the probable success of the morrow, and to curse in his heart the inopportune arrival of the adven- turous rifleman. * This account of the battle of Oriskany was extracted from the MS., and published, with some trivial alteration, in theN. Y. Sunday Times.   REBELS AND TORIES.             131 CIIAPTER XXIIIT. 'THE BETRAYER AND TIIE BETRAYED. THE dawn of the following morning gave token of a fair day, and the in- mates of the clergyman's dwelling were astir with the earliest songs of the birds. A stroll around the cultivated fields gave a hearty relish to the homely breakfast at which they sat down with abundant cheerfulness. Every countenance, if we may except Upton's, gave token of a contented mind, and the conversation was mostly confined to the general topics of the day; and the instrumentality of, the British officers in procuring the co-operation of the savages in the prosecution of the war, came in for no small share of censure. Anecdotes of adventure were related by Murphy, interlarded with numerous sage moralities from the lips of Mr. Monroe, and the good hostess presided at the head of the Wbard with that ineffable grace and good nature which so be- come a Christian lady; while Arline, only now and then answering a ques- tion as it was put to her, listened with much interest to Murphy's relations, or the remarks of her kind friend and patron. Upton, however, felt but little interest in anything that was said. he was so completely out of temper with himself, and those around him, that he was forced to plead a severe headache to excuse his want of cheerfulness, the sole cause of which he himnself knew to be the presence of Murphy, whom at first sight he so completely learned to hate, that he more than once wished him beneath the Indian's tomahawk; and this dislike was heightened by having observed that Murphy took occasion every few minutes to fix upon him one of those looks that indicated a desire to read him to the soul. lie could not meet them, in spite of his reputation for nerve, and this "falling from him" was not unnoticed by the rifleman. We cannot say he mistrusted Upton; but the latter possessed an expression of feature that did not harmonize with his notions of physiognomy. In fact, there was that mutual dislike between them which is as difficult to explain as to over- come, though the feeling in this instance, on the part of Upton, arose from his sense of Murph 's superiority. He wished him out of the way-dead, if no other cause coull procure his absence; and he put his wits to work to invent new plans, in case the villainy arranged for that day should be postponed. But why it was, unless Providence had a design to bring him to a stern jus- tice on some future day, that the way was made clear for him, and all ob- stacles removed, is more than our philosophy can tell. But thus it was. Breakfast was over, and Murphy intimated his intention to depart as hastily as possible, alleging, as an excuse, that difficulties were expected with the In- dians in the neighborhood of German Flatts, and he was desirous of being there in time to join the inhabitants in repelling the attack. "You see," said he, "I was so glad to see you, and kept so busy talking all last evening, that I forgot to tell you anything about it; and so yo must excuse me, and I will come to see you again as soon as possible." The clergyman and his good lady expressed regret at his sudden departure, but they did not venture to expostulate, and praying that he might be pre- served through the many dangers to which he was constantly exposed, shook  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7034-00000067"/> '132        REBELS AND TORIES. him by the hand, with many hearty expressions of good-will. Turning to Arline, he said- "And you, Miss--hat shall I say? I never learned many fine words, for I take i that honest ones are much more to the purpose. You know I am a great deal obliged to you for being found in such bad company when I first saw you. I don't mean anything, Miss; but I am glad that you got into that scrape, as long as you warn't hurt. 'cause by that reason I came to know you. I hope, Miis, the smallest glossy curl that hangs down that pretty neck may never come to harm; if it does, I should mightily like to be in the neigh- borhood about that time. You mustn't laugh at me, any of you, because I say such things. I'm plain and blunt, and I always like to speak outjist what's on my mind, and don't want to have a thought that aint honest. You see, Miss, I am a lonely man, and if I was to get lilled to-morrow, I don't know who'd care; and you see such thoughts aint pleasant. One wants a friend, if only to think of; and I don't want to make mourners, and it makes me feel bad to see sad faces; but though I'm an ignorant man, I believe in a hereafter, and I con- fess to the sin that I would like to know that some one was sorry if I was taken off-that's the most unnatural feeling that I've got, and I'can't help that. You mustn't let the wild Ingins get hold of you again; I've got cause enough to despise 'em now-I don't want to hate 'em. You must take care of yourself, for it does me good to see you, and I mean to come again by and bye. Good bye! There's no use for me to say, 'God bless you!' for I know he will, as you have a kind of trust and confidence, like." All the while he was speaking, Murphy held the tips of Arline's delicate fingers in his hard and sinewy hands; and she stood with her eyes upon the floor half filled with tears, for she was thinking of some one else, though she heard him and thanked him for all he said. It was not strange that the honest rifleman should address her so, for he was ignorant of any previous attachment on her part, or of the melancholy circumstances attending it. It was quite natural for him to feel an interest in Arline, having rescued her from immediate peril, and feeling attached by her pensive manner as well as by her sweet and thoughtful face; and though his words, in a measure, might have been pain- ful to her, yet at the same time they were gratifying. To Upton, however, they were daggers, and only endurable from the belief that the end was near, and his own plans so close upon completion. But Murphy had a parting word to say to him, and he addressed him thus: "Stranger, this is the first time we have met, and I haven't asked you on which side you fight. I am glad I find you in good company, and that is some recommendation; but as you seem to be a very proper young fellow, as regards to build, if you aint engaged, and want employment, I guess I can put you i the way. Not being long in these parts, you don't know much about the In- gins yet, and if you are in the habit of scouring round much, you must keep a hawk's eye in your head, for if they pounce upon you unawares I wouldn't give much for your hide and taller. But I'd rather be killed, and scalped, and burnt to death by the Ingins, heathen as they are, than to fight against my country; and so I hope, I say, that you are pn the right side, because, though we have slept under the same roof, and eaten at the same table, if I catcht you   R E B ELS  AND   r O IE E S.         133 fighting on the side of the British, I'd have no more mercy on you than I would on a black snake-nor half so much, for I'd kill you before 1 would the snake.  Remember, if you want any lessons, come to me, and I won't charge you nothing.  It's the prettiest fun alive when you get used to it, and you won't mind it any more than going to sleep, nor half so much, if you are oblig- ed to make your bed on the wet ground." Upton made him but little reply, and after another shake of the hands, away he went as merry as a lark, singing one of the rude provincial ballads of the day, in these words: Let the Yankee boys advance With the gallant sons of France, And swear to n iu the battle or to die; We shall make the British run, And capture every gun For the eagle and the stars must fly! Must fly Where the English standard waves O'er the heads of hired slaves, We will dig our foes their graves! Then for ever wave our flag, bold and free  We have sworn for life or death To never yield a breath Till we win the prize we seek-Liberty! Liberty! Till the battle's smoke is o'er, And no more the cannons roar, And Peace and Plenty reigns o'er our plains, O'er our plains! And from -our happy fields ,         The abundant harvest yields Its yellow grains! Then, secure from war's alarms, We'll have other use for arms- Some have wives, some have lasses to embrace, Whose affections then shall prove A recompense of love To the brave who met the foo face to face! Face to faoe! When his batteries, as they spoke, Column after column broke, Yet defied him as they form'd and charged again! Till our bulleo, aa they flew, Cut their squadrons through and through, IUke a pelting northern blast of frozen rain! Bat we'll nse'r forget the brave Who slumber in the grave, Who fell amidst the bloody shock of war!  But we'll point out where they sleep To the young, and bid them keep In thought how much we owe To the silent dust below, Whoso ddc, have help'd to make as what we wo!  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7034-00000068"/> 134         REBELS AND    TORIES. '- That is a brave and happy fellow," said the clergyman, as Murphy turned a corner and disappeared from sight. "But for him, in all probability, I should never have lived to preach a sermon in this settlement. God prosper him! but he is a reckless and daring man, and I don't believe has any more personal fear than yonder stone-physical fear, I mean; for I don't think he has the courage to do a mean or a bad action." "He seems a proper sort of a man, enough," said Upton; " thoughl I think he has a charming way of telling a story to his own advantage. If he can fight as well as lie talks--" "Equally as well, young man, and a little better, if you are anxious to know," said Mr. Monroe, a little angered, not so much at the matter of Upton's remark, as at the manner in which he spoke. "Oh, I'm not particular," said Upton. "I dare say he is all you represent, and I hope he is. I suppose he often finds occasion to visit you?" "Why. we have been here but a short time, as yet-only about a month or so, you know, and of course he could not have visited us very often-only twice previous to this." "Well," said Upton, assuming a manner as agreeable as he could, "I meant nothing by my remarks. He seems to be a hearty, manly fellow, who would not mind putting his own head in jeopardy to save that of a friend, or do a service to any one else. I was much pleased with him, and was sorry that a confounded headache prevented me from enjoying his society as much as I wished. If I conclude to stop long in this section, I may, perhaps, if an opportunity occurs, see him in battle, as I have some strong notions at present of volunteering. I have a fancy for the right side of an argument, which I can't overcome, dnd my sympathies are 'most decidedly in favor of my own country." This speech greatly pleased the clergyman, for he had never heard Upton express his preference before, and his concluding words went far to remove from Mr. Monroe's mind many hard suspicions in reference to his patriotism. This was the exact design of Upton, for he was aware that the other had some doubts about his position, as an American, and, in order to drown these sus- picions, thereby forwarding his own designs, he made up his mind to play the part of a hypocrite. He saw the necessity of conducting himself in as amiable a manner as possible, as he desired- that there should be no failure in his plans; and he made up his mind at once to be very careful what he said or did to hazard the chance of Arline's consent to walk with him in the after- noon. As they stood together, Mrs. Monroe came to the door and called her hus- band into the house, and Upton took this opportunity of walking toward the pasture where his horse was kept. Ite began to think it most time for the appearance of Newberry's messenger, and he grew a little impatient lest the tory shoulid have forgotten him; and thus, pondering upon his schemes, he at last approached the inclosure where he expected to find his animal, but he was no where to be seen. Could he have gotten out himself? No, for the fences were in good repair. He must have been stolen! was his first suspi- cion; and so he examined the bars, and there he found by the tracks. that his   REB-ELS AND TORIES.-            135 horse had been led out during the night. The next thllought was--where had h-e been taken? By whom had he been stolen-white man or Indian?--shoe or moccasin? He looked again for footsteps, and found themn-they were the tracks of the white man. What, then were his conclusions? .Why, sensible enough to be sure. A thought all at once struck him that Newberry did not approve the foolish plan of sending to borrow his horse-a proceeding toward a new comer in a place that xwould lead!to inquiries that imiight prove incon- venient to answer. So he was satisfied, or at least he made up his mind to be so. and he felt that the first step in his vile purpose had beeli talrken. He now returned to the house to complete his arrangements. In the first place he must secure his money. le had about him, in gold, the amount, perhaps, of five or six hundred dollars' In his valise le had nothin, but some changes of clothing. and this he saw that he must leave behind. The money was secured about his person in:a belt. It was a dangerous experiment, at that time, for a lone man to carry so large an amount of specie about him; but Upton had probably made up liis mind that whoever got it must do so at the sacrifice of his life, and when that was gone, money Was of but little conse- quence. He said nothing to any one about lis horse being missing, and it was not likely to be discovered for some time. And so the day wore away till toward noon, when Uptln reminded Arline of her promise to walk with him; and although not in tihe most agreeable mood for a stroll, so accommo- dating was her disposition to every one, that she finally consented. Thus some minds, too easily swayed, too pliant to resist, too amiable to refuse, are led step by step to their own ruin, while the artfulness of the seducer goes unrebuked of justice, and often sits richly attended in high places, while the victim, in uncomplaining grief, wears out her days in misery. Dinner at length came and passed with the usual ceremonies, after which Mr. Monroe retired to his study to prepare his discourse for the following Sunday, and Arline in a few moments more was ready to accompany Upton. As they departed, Mrs. Monroe followed them to the door, bidding them not to go far nor stay long. So they strolled down one road and up another, talking of trees, birds, flowers; and every object that attracted the attention of Arline. This was the policy of Upton, to speak only of s/uch things as he knew pleased her; and as he never addressed her in any language warmer than friendship, she had the utmost confidence in him. She was aware that Mr. Monroe entertained a prejudice against him, but for what reason she was ignorant; and as his conduct to her had been uniformly respectful, she was inclined to charge the clergyman with injustice. Of a nature entirely unsuspicious, she could see nothing in his connection with the death of Rowley to make her dislike him. Came he not near sharing the same fate? Such was the testimony; and the incident, instead of prejudicing her against him, gave him an interest in her eyes greater than lie otherwise would have had. At length they had come to a turn in a road where they paused for a few moments to admire the scenery.  Here U[pton proposed to visit the Falls of Tekalharawa.  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7034-00000069"/> 136         REBELS AND TORIES. "It is but a short distance from where we now are. We shall have plenty of time, and can get home in good season." ' I would rather defer it to some other time, if you please," said Arline, "I am afraid I shall go away to-morrow." said Upton, "and I should like to have the pleasure of visiting the place with you, for the sake of hearing your opinion."  "I am  sorry you leave us so soon," answered the simple girl. ' Do you really think you shall leave'us to-morrow?" "Such is my present intention, if nothing prevents,'" said Utron. "And so if you refuse to visit the Tekaharawa with me. you delve me of a pleasure." "Oh, if that is the case," said she, 'I will go with you indeed. It is not far r?" "No, it is but a b short distance from here, and we can go and return in an hour-." Agreed upon, and so they walked along, all the way talking as before to the pleasure of Arline, wtose fancy Upton played to in a most charmingly de- ceitfidl manner, she all the while manifesting the greatest pleasure in every beautiful thing in nature. It was a tedious road though to Upton, as the paths of villainy always are; and as they neared the place of their destination, and they could hear the fall- ing of the waters, a most unpleasant anxiety took possession of him, and he almost wished he had never undertaken anything in the affair. At length they came in sight of the Falls, and so up they wound their way upon the cliffs above, and there stood they awhile upon the edge of the abyss, looking down upon the whirling waters below, till the brain of Arline grow dizzy with terror, and sheminstinctively moved back a few paces toward the shadow of a wood. The time now drew near for Upton to expect the appearance of his hirelings in crime, and he began to look about him with anxiety. Arline, too, began to talk of returning, as the shadows were lengthening in the valleys, and the sun was on apace toward the western hills. "Wait but a  little while," said Upton. "I .want you to e the effect of the sunlight upon yonder small vale, and the circle of tall maples that crown the rising ground that surrounds it. I have lingered here, until past this hour on several occasions. and since I first observed it, I have never failed to find fresh beauties in it. Now it begins-observe yonder dark tree, its bran- ches waving like dark plumes. it is a pine, and as there has sprung up within a  few minutes a fine breeze from the south-west, you may hear it sighing and sobbing,. as though it were a perturbed, restless spirit. Look at yonder elm -see how  transparent are its leaves, with the sunlight shining through. There is a  maple, taller than the rest, with its leaves dark green, standing there like a  monarch, just rustling its foliage a little as a lady does her silks. One would think it very proud. It is the rock-maplel I believe. Yonder are others, with delicate branches and pale-green leaves; they lack the nobility of the other tree, though appwently more proud, as you may detect it in the ain nodding of their tops, as though they were flattered by the wind that   REBELS AND    TORIES.           137 toys with them. There is a clump of hemlocks-trees truly democratic, and their branches stick out at right angles anmd every other way; and the fan-like extremities wave up and down like fins or the hands of a Chinese lady in an opium fit; but I like the tree, nevertheless; it fills in well on a landscape. Then there is the graceful fir, tapering like a ship's mast-courtesying and nodding like a high dame of the olden time. And there is the clean-limwcd. elegant beech, strong-set and toppy, though the sunlight through its trans- parent foli&amp;ge gives it an airy lightness. There, also, is the big-trunked strong-branching chestnut-in its youth and beauty elegant and proud--in its old age ugly and scraggy. It has a long life, and when out of the world leaves a goodly progeny behind. But yonder is the king of the forest, the oak, musculat and strong, with its sturdy branches high-reaching, tfr-stretch- ing, as though it would embrace the leavens. Proud and haughty, detiant alike of the tempest and the lightning, at some future day it may ride, as the keel of some monster ship, through thit awful northern seaos, amid the rovr of ceaseless storms and crash of icebergs. Such may be its dlestiny. To what end may we trace our own! But there, to your eye., is a sight more gra- cious than'the rest. 1 see you have noticed it. It is a limpid brook, brawl- ing along as noisily as possible-tumbling over the pebbles that, lifting their slippery sides, strive to impede its progress. See how the sunlight falls upon it, till it sparkles like diamond-drops, while the doughty mariners that navi- gate its perilous shoals and breakers, are nothing less than' grass-hoppers, lady-bugs, beetles, and such other small craft.  And sometimes the shore ap- proaches it sloping and gravclly, the tiny stones bronzed with damp moss; again green-carpeted, with soft and tender grass, that peeps out even in the very edge of the water ; anon, turning almost 'a right angle, it ploughs a channel op- posite the point round which it turns, leaving an abrupt and high bank, over- grown with sedge, against which the frogs peep out with their spirit-like eyes, and call to each other in noisy cholmu.  Willows overhang it, whose slender tendrils dip in its sparkling water at every breeze that touches theml; and fastened upon the sides of the larger stones in the bottom, are small black snails, no doubt for all their diminutivecness, feeling as much for life as the best of us. Tiny fish-little ones, scarce bigger than your finer-sport among its bays, and coves, and deep places, and crawling along the sedgy edges, is'some monster of the brook, no larger than a chestnut-a devouring creature, before whom fly the frightened inhabitants of the stream. If you love such things, you may pleasantly spend the whole of a summer's afternoon by the margin of a brook like this, or following its course for a space, every now and then stopping to dally with its ripplvs, or cool the' pulses of your wrists in its limpid current."' "These things I do most dearly love," said Arline. "And for that reason I shall never be sorry that I left the city to come here where nature reigns in her own right. I had only known of such things before, by reading of them; but I had found them described with so much earnest fooling, that I kscew from the instinctive promptings of my own heart, that such scenes must have existence, for no imagination of man could raise from non-existence so much that was beautiful.

"Iow much, then, must our feelings be alike," said Upton, with well-dis- sembled fervor. "In all the time that I have so far lived, I have never felt so much the worth of life as since I left the city. One has more room here for good thoughts, as well as more room for the lungs, than in crowded streets- besides, there is here less hypocrisy." They now moved forward a few paces, and then, looking around hinm, Upton remarked that it was time to walk hometward, to which Arline assented; but as they turned, some movement in a clump of bushes near by, attracted her attention, and she became greatly alarmed as thoughts of Indian treachery took possession of her mind. She pointed out the spot to Upton, and urged the propriety of returning as hastily as possible. But lie laughed at her fears, and said she could only have been frightened by a rabbit, for he had noticed two or three skipping along as they passed. But he knew better, and his heart began to beat with emotion as he felt certain that Newberry was near him, and that in a fqw moments the machinery of the plot which he had planned would be set in motion. He dreaded it-for what reason he could not have said; at least not from any compunction of conscience: that he had drilled to be a most pliable servant--himnself the dictator. At that instant a hawk, circling the air above them, descended upon one of the lofty trees a few rods frot them, to trim his plumes and feathers for another flight, and Upton desired Arline to pause and watch its motions. Believing that the cause of her fright had been explained, she did as he requested, and thus while they stood gazing upon the proud bird, Newberry and his companion sprang from their lurking places, and ere Arline was conscious of what had happened, the tory had knocked Upton dofwn, and the other had taken forcible possession of herself. Seeing that she was thus in the hands of ruffians, with Upton lying defenceless upon the ground, dreadful horror took possession of her, and utter- ing a  wild shriek, she lay insensible in the arms of her captor. To give more effect to the scene, Newberry now began to pour out cur:ses upon Upton, designating him as a cursed tory whom be meant to hang, at the same time proceeding to bind him strongly with cords. His treatment was so rough, however, that Upton remonstrated in whispers; but the tory had been engaged for his work, and he took a pleasure in this instance in performing it in the most thorough manner. "Never you mind," said lie; "I know my duty. Do you want everybody in yjour secret? When I gets well paid for a job, I likes to do it up sort o' ship-shape. Yonder fellow I wouldn't trust with spilt meat for bears. He knows nothin' of this business, furder nor what he sees, and if you keep dark he'll never be the wiser for it. Didn't I manage the hoss-business well'? Steat'd him of course; that was the proper way. Now when they come to find you and the gal there missin, and the hoss gone, they'll maybe make a search that wont amount to nothin'; and some one may track you to this place, and seein' sights of a scuffle, they'll conclude upon foul play, and lay the blame on the Ingins. Aint I right?" This speech, intended partly as advice and partly as explanation, was   REBELS   AN!D TORIES.           139 whispered in the cars of Tpton, as lie lay upon the ground; and he said in l reply: "Well, well, I suppose you are riglit; only don't forget that I am a prisoner by option, and not bind your cords too tightly on mly wrists; and look that your friend there acts in a becoming and hunlane manner toward the younll woman; and, moreover, get throulgh withl this part of the business as. quickly as possible." "Oh ho! but you are a fine chap to talk of humanity!" exclaimed New- berry. "But I'll warrant you the gal will find my friend there as gentle as a dove. If anything goes wrong I'll answer for it." Turning, then, to his companion, Newberry called out: "Be careful with the lady, Jim. Hold on to her for a minute, till I finish tying this chap, and then I'll nmount the old hoss, and git you to hand her lup to me. If she only keeps as quiet as that all the way, she wont give us imuch trouble." "Yes," answered his companion.  "She lies in my arms herec with her mouth open, as tempting as ripe fruit, and I've jest the greatest mind in the world to taste. It can't do no hurt, and it aint pisen." This speech pleased not the the cars of Upton, and whispering to New- berry, he- remonstrated against the brutality of the fellow. "One's as good's another, I guess, as fur as that's consmencd, but jest to please you I'll holler to him. Look here, Jim-you nmsn't  be familiar nor rnothin' with that ere gall, cause she aint non o' yourl, and what's more, she aint a-goin' to be. Now. sir, I guess I've got you all right. Kick and strug- gle a little to show you don't like it; and if you're amind to rip out a curse or so agin me, I'm sure I shan't mind it. Things will look more real like." The plot had so far worked well. Arline had not yet recovered fionm her swoon, and lay as passive as a child in the arms of the wretch who had seized her. They were soon ready for a start, and ordering Jim to bring forward the horses, Newberry mounted one of them, and Arline was handed up into the saddle before him. rite motion revived her, and opening her eyes, she cast about her a terrified look ; and finding llow desperate was her situation- Upton lying bound near by-she appealed with heart-rending accents to the humanity of her captors, adding that sihe could be of no use or service to them, and that if they would only release herself and her companion, they would be entitled to her everlasting gratitude-other reward she had none to pay. But. as a matter of course, it was of no avail; for, in answer to her ap- peal, Newberry would only say: "My dear girl, I'm sorry for you, and I won't harm you a bit; but that ere chap there-there is things aginst him as might send him to the gallus, and as youv'e been found in his company, it's near likely that you know something about him. You see, Miss, we don't mind hanging a tory when- ever we can catch him; and I could almost swear pint blank that he was one on 'em." Of what use were all Arline's arguments, foredoomed as she was? She pleaded till the ears of the reptiles she addressed got tired with listening; and then, with hypocrisy the most artful. Upton remonstrated, threatened. begged,  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7034-00000071"/> "O         REBELS AND TORIES. all to no purpose; for the game was well played, and he was only answered by Newberry with laughter. He was then placed upon a horse with his hands tied, (had he not received that hint from his ride between Flathush and Brooklyn?) and Jim taking the rein, with a huge pistol threatened to blow out his brains the instant he made an attempt to escape. The party com- menced their march in the direction of Newberry's hut, where they arrived some time after dark, without meeting with any impediment upon the road. Let us now return to the settlement. Not long after Upton and Arline went out for their walk, some one of the neighbors noticed that his horse had gone from the field where he had been placed; and thinking that the clergy- man's visitor had departed, and passing by at the time, called in upon them. Here the neighbor learned that the young man had only gone out for a walk, and communicated the disappearance of his horse. Mr. Monroe took the pains to examine the fences, and returned without any clue to the whereabouts of the animal. After reflecting a little upon the circumstance, the most natural conclusion was that he had been stolen, probably by some of the wandering tories, or perhaps by an Indian. The incident created some alarm at first, but this in a short time subsided, as they were convinced that, had the village been visited by any considerable body of men, inimical to the republican in- terests, the loss of stock or property had been greater. No trace, however, could be discovered of the missing horse, and Mr. Monroe concluded to make no further inquiries until the return of Upton: Thus time passed away. The sun verged well toward the west, and the swallows and martins had already commenced their eccentric gyrations in the air. It was time, thought Mrs. i., for the young people to coune home; but the sun still got lower, and yet no signs of their returning. So the clergyman and his wife took a stroll in the direction they had taken, expecting to meet them, and they walked and walked, till the evening's dew began to fall; and then, in fear of its dampness, the good dame thought it prudent to return. An  hour after this passed away, and the venerable couple still watched from the steps of the door; but no sign indicated the approach of the wanderers. Mr. -wells, his wife, and Jane his sister ran over to inquire if they had come; and now alarm took the place of expectation, as the evening crept on. apace, and still no, Arline-no Upton. Was there a suspicion of wrong? if so it was     quickly put aside as a thought unworthy generous minds. More neighbors now came in, and it was proposed to turn out in search. It was suspected that they had taken the road leading to the Tekaharawa, as they had been heard    to express a desire to visit that place. .Then what? It was possible that the Indians might have been in the neighborhood, and thus have captured them. H Iuman nature has its virtues, in spite of what a few bitter minded persons may say; and the news of the missing party soon spread through the settlement, and a party of sturdy men was soon made up, who armed themselves, and went out in search---even in the night, when, by the event which called them out, thery had every reason to fear that they might fall into an amlush of In- dians. But they were men inured to danger, living constantly in its midst, and the slightest call from a fellow being i distress was enough to rouse their best enerot-es.   REBELS AND 'T     I E S'.        141 So they marched out of the village-ten strong-hearted, well-armed men, and taking the road which led to theFalls, they pushed forward with anxious hearts and watchful eyes; for the moon had now risen, pouring great floods of light over the scene. Not long were they in reaching the Falls, exploring the ground about, not even omitting the chasm, into which, some one hinted, ' they might have fallen. Then they climbed to the high cliffs above, searching behind trees and among bushes, but as yet no clue to the mystery. Yet still they gave not up, but went heartily to work, till hope finally abandoned them, and they began to think that the search must be postponed till the morrow, when by the daylight they might meet with better success. At length wearied out and disappointed, the majority proposed returning, when one of the party, in advance of the others, called out that he had found something that be- longed to the young woman; and the rest. hastening toward him, discovered in his hands a hood, or sun-bonnet, such as several of them had frequently seen upon the head of Arline. It was recognised as hers, and looking about them, they saw evidences upon the ground of a struggle, the prints of horses' feet, &amp;c.; and finally a handkerchief was picked up, and recognised as having been seen in the possession of Upton. What was the conclusion? Not that Indians had been in the neighborhood; for in that case surer proofs of what had happened would have been found. A consultation was held, the result of which was, that the outrage was committed by the tories, whom they had sus- pected of lurking about the neighborhood for some time; though one or two among them, connecting the incident with the disappearance of Upton's horse, and the tracks of horses' feet around them, more than hinted that the mystery about the affair was too deep to be real-that is, too much of it to be the result of possible accidents. Opinions differed in many points, though the majority- still considered Upton a victim, as they could not understand what object the young man could accomplish by the performance of such a piece of rascality. However, all agreed to return, as further search that night would be of no use, and in the morning place the results of their search before the committee of the village, and see what action they might think proper to take in the prom- ises. Mr. and Mrs. Monroe were almost inconsolable for the loss of Arline, "and refused to be comforted." CHAPTER XXIV. THlE ESCAPE. "ET us see now rlwho are the inmates of Newherrr's hut: himself, his com- panion Jim. Upton and Arline. It was morning, fair and beautiful as though sin had never blighted a thing on earth. Arline had passed, as may be imagined, a restless night of terror, though she had been allowed the privilege of a separate apartment and a rude couch of straw and rags for a bedt. But her complaint and her wrongs overreached these inconveniences. Not even when a prisoner in tho hands of the Indians, had she so comlnpletely bln  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7034-00000072"/> "2         REBELS AND    TORIES. abandoned to despair. Now, what might be her fate, in the den of these white ruffians? She had not seen Upton since they first arrived at the hut, nor n^vany one else with whom she could communicate. As morning dawned she endeavored to examine the place of her confinement; but it was without windows, and all the light that came into it shone through the crevices between the logs; yet that was sufficient to enable her the more fully to appreciate her situation. The room was without other furnishing than the couch of sticks upon which she lay, and a log in lieu of a chair. A gun or two, an axe, a pair of horse pistols, a few suits of uniform, and various remnants of garments were all' that she could discover in the place; and she waited in anxious suspense for the appearance of some one capable of explaining the reason of her capture. Outside the hut, stood Newberry in conversation with Upton. Jim had been sent out to reconnoitre and give notice of any hostile approach, for it was expected that the village would turn out as soon as it was discovered that Arline was missing. "Now, youngster, having put your foot so far in this scrape, what step are you goin' to take next?" asked Newberry. It was a simple question enough, but how natural was it for Upton to be puzzled by it--not that he felt any compunction for the proceedings thus far; but his real character was yet to be exposed to Arline, and he was studying what way would be thl best to commence the unpleasant business. At present she might sympathise with his supposed misfortune, in connection with her own--believing him to be a captive as well as herself, he certainly came in for a share of her respect. But what would she say, when she asccr-. tained that he was the sole inventor of thfe plot--when she understood fully the position in which he stood toward her? lie felt that there was a scene to be enacted of a nature so unpleasant that he well might shrink from it. His silence, therefore, obliged Newberry to repeat his question. '"Well, having put my foot so far in it, as you say, I am determined to go through with the business." "But what do you expect to make out of her? The way she will give you X the length of her tongue, when she knows you, would frighten an Ingin!" "It is ab+ad weapon, I know; but not so sharp as swords, nor so hard as cannon balls." "Then I dont believe you know much of either. Why, a scolding woman, sir, when she's right up in airnest, aint no more to be compared to a storm of a battery than the roar of the lion to the barking of a poodle." "Why, by your talk you must have experience in both," said Upton. " To be sure," said the tory, '; and I never met anything so terrible in my life as a wofman's tongue." ' Then I have a plan to escape the first fire. You muLst go in and see her She will explode a whole magazine of reproaches upon yourself:. Ypu can then open the case a little, take another fire: and retire. After that I think I shall be able to manage her myself. What, you don't like it?" "Not a bit-but I'll do it if it will accommodate. But what are you a goin' to do with the gal?"   REBELS AND    TORIES.          143 :Marry her, you fool!" said Upton. Newberry laughed, the idea to him was so preposterous. "Marry a gal that will hate you?" said he. "; I would rather swaller a live rattlesnake, But for sartain do you want me to break the ice?" "' Go in--tell her what you please-clear your own skirts as much as you can, and let me know the result." 'V Well, if I must, I must. She can't kill me, anyhow," said Newberry, as he retired into the hut. Arline sat upon her couch of straw and rags, a perfect picture of despair, wringing her hands with great grief, and deploring with bitter tears her fate: ThIedoor opened, and Newberry entered. "Well, Miss, make the best ol't," said he. ,L A misfortin's a misfortin, and takin' on wont mend it." "Why am I here? what have I done? who are my enemies?" were ques- tions asked in quick succession by Arline. "One at a time, and maybe I can answer," said the villain fwith an impu- dent grin. "AWhy was I forcibly made captive? who have I ever injured? Oh, sir, if you have the least spark of compassion, set me free. I will pray for you-I will bless you for ever." "You see, nobody wants to harm you," said Newberry. "Keep as quiet as a larnb. I'll do my best for you. 'Taint me as is the head of all this." Who then is? I recognise you as the person who knocked down and captured my companion." "But I didn't touch you, and I guess I didn't hurt him much--loastways, it wan't bargained for." '; Explain, then, the mystery," said Arline. "Oh, liberate me, and I am sure you will be well rewarded." "Ah, what could I get, now, to run the risk of settin' you free. You see it would be worth something, as I might raise up a nest of enemies agin me." ; A reward of your own conscience, I mcean. Only think how much hap- pier you would feel-how much sweeter you would sleep." "Oh, I don't know much about that.:' said the wretch, whose hopes had for an instant been excited by the visions of a reward of money. "I must ask the youngster first." :' What youngster?-who do you mean?" ' Him as you was walkin' with." * i; What has he to do with it?" "A good deal more'n you think." ; Explain yourself." :' Well. The chap come to me t'other day and tells me a long story how he lov'd a gal that he didn't believe cared a copper for him; but that the passion, as he called it, was eatin' him up. He said he know'd there warn't no use in speakin' to her on the subljc' a nd so he was determined to use main force, as he was afeard you'd pop onto some one else before he know'd it.

Was this possible? she thought. And now a thousand words and actions of Upton's arose in her mind that she had never before noticed, convincing her his attentions were prompted by a warmer feeling than mere friendship. And then again she banished them, as unworthy charges, too likely to be pronpted by her own vanity. Was she to believe what Newberry had said? If so, then melancholy, indeed, was her situation, when those she trusted plotted to betray her. She looked in the face of Newberry, but his features indicated every phase of bad passion, and the smile that lighted them con- vinced her that to him she need look for no sympathy or assistance. She had not hitherto suspected Upton and she felt that, before she condemned him, she needed other confirmation than the words of one whose own confession proclaimed him at least a participant in the matter of her abduction. "If this be true." said she to the tory, ' how can you prove it to me?" :The youngster shall tell you so himself" said he; "and if that aint enough, then I'll swear to it." "With your permission, I suppose. Is he not then a captive, as well as myself?" "He is as free to go and come as I," said Newberry. "Send him to me, then, that I may at once know the truth of your asser- tions." The tory left her to do as she requested, and for a few moments she was left in a painful state of suspense. What was to be her fate, if what she had heard should prove true? What could have induced Upton to act as he had been accused of doing? . These were sorrowful reflections, and they blended with the death of Rowley, suspicions for the first time excited. Upton soon entered. His appearance at once went far to condemn him. His eyes seemed unwilling to meet the scrutinizing glance of her own, and his whole demeanor was so changed-so unlike the bold bearing of an honest man, that she at first hesitated to address him, so loath was she to hasten a confession that must condemn him. "Well," she at length said, "am I to believe what has been told mo. Is it to you whom I have never harmed, even by word or thought, that I owe this treatment? Do you confirm this by your own confession. as well as by your manner?" "What shall I say?"' said Upton. "Can you imagine why I should have done this?" "Enough!-you have said enough to convince me.  What were your reasons?-what could have induced you? what could I have done to cause. your enmity? what do you intend?" Nothing to cause my enmity, Arline. But I love you, and despaired. I saw by your cold politeness, that my hopes were useless I knlw you were surrounded by tfiose who were prejudiced against me. You shall not be harmed-have no fears of that. Only consent to my wishes, and no woman ever had so obedient a slave as I shall be to you." "And you have taken proper steps to obtain what you desire. Shall I tell you my suspicions? No, for then you might kill me! Yet even death would  " .            ,'f   REBELS AND TORIES.             146 be preferable to what you propose. If you want my gratitude, return me to my friends."  "To be betrayed, perhaps. No; I have gone too far to retrace my steps. f Seeing no alternative, you may at length consent to be mine, rather than be abandoned to the loose passions of those who are around you. One destiny is inevitable." "Neither; for I would sooner court destruction at my own hands. Feeble as I am-mild, perhaps, as you have always thought me, you will not find it so easy to accomplish your object as you suppose." "What would resistance be worth in such weak hands as yours? You   l may become a wife, honored and beloved. Lack you the disposition to choose X between such a condition, and one of doubtful reputation? You must suppose that I possess the same power to bend you to my will here, as I did to secure you in the first place, and as I had the will to begin, so have r the  mind to execute."  "It is a contemptible trick! Mean and cowardly must you be, to prove  such a slave to your passions. Even if you have the power to force me to your will, it is impossible that you can enjoy one moment's happiness with a woman you have so grossly outraged. A fool's device, surely, of which, suc- ceeded you never so much, you would soon get tired. What possession is so worthless as that of a woman who despises you? What fate so dreadful as to be bound to a person whose affections you cannot control! Will you not pause before proceeding further?" "No; I shall trust to -time to effect all that is necessary; and you may yet have to call upon me to protect you from outrages worse than these of which ,you complain. Here, for the present you must abide. This place is too re- mote from other habitations to attract any attention,'and those who visit it are friends of the inmates; not even the savage dare trouble the lair of these wild animals. To convince you of this, it is only necessary to tell you that you are in the hut of a notorious tory; and the forest around is perhaps at this moment swarming with savages." "Th4e are instruments of destruction here, whose aid I will seek sooner than submit to you." "Oh, well; if you would damn yourself by self-destruction, I am sure I can- not help that. But these are threats oftener made than executed; and a few days' reflection, I trust, will materially change the tenor of your thoughts." But will you not release me? Are you so wholly lost to feeling, as to have no mercy? Will no appeal reach you? Consider how much wrong you are doing. Think, if you have a sister, what would be your feelings to know that she had been treated as I have been. Will you defy the judg- ment of heaven in carrying out the awful scheme which you have undertaken? For the lote of mercy, let me go!-turn me into the forest's deptls, so that I am out of this den! Upton! Upton! I implore yod, as you hope for mercy at God's hand, to proceed no further in this! Give me back my liberty and I will bless you!" "You must submit. This is but a paroxysm that will soon pass away; and the terror you speak of is only imaginary. Come, I will not press you 10 It  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7034-00000074"/> "6         REBELS   AND  TORIES. too hard to-day. I will give you till to-morrow to make up your mind, and you may commence by thinking as well of me as possible. I have no doubt but you will take a right view of the case."' With these words he retired, and Arline was left once more to her own re- flections. Now she understood fully her situation, and almost gave herself up to its dreadful realities. Upton related his success to Newberry, who only laughed at him for med- dling with her at all; and prophesied that he would come to no good, if he was fit for nothing else but to deceive and ruin women. And then the older villain taxed his memory to tell him how many instances there were on rec- ord where men had been ruined by woman's influence, and defied him to men- tion the name of one great man who had risen to fortune by having anything to do with the opposite sex; and gave innumerable accounts of great enter- prises lost, and men destroyed, through the schemings, and plottings, and mischief-making of women. By this time Jim had returned from his tour of inspection, and reported no signs of trouble. He had fallen in with nothing more than an Indian trail, which had probably passed along that morning, about half a mile distant; and judging by the signs which he noticed, he thought their numbers could not exceed eight or ten. This gave Newberry no uneasiness, for he knew, that with the single exception of the Oneidas, and a small portion of the Tuscaroras, he stood in good favor with the red man. A settlement had now to be effected between Newberry and Upton, which was not made without some cavilling on the part of both. The tory wanted extra pay for the use of his hut; and the young man having so b unglingly managed the business as to:expose a portion of his funds to the avaricious eyes of the tory, the latter insisted, with unmistakable zeal, that, unless he was remunerated in the sum of twenty-five dollars more for the use of his "house," and for the hire of his companion, Jim,-he should be obliged to abandon him to his fate, if not in honor bound to restore the young woman to her friends. Thus rogues are ofteAentrapped in their own snares. Here was a fine sub- ject for a quarrel, that Upton dare not enter upon with the odds thulgainst him. He knew that Newberry had him in his power; and by betraying him, and returning Arline to her friends, he could procure an immunity for his past conduct. The tory had hinted nothing of the kind; but as base minds are ever suspicious, Upton was quick to imagine such a result; and so, much against his will, he was forced to pay the amount demanded. In the meantime there was a great commotion in the settlement of Cherry Valley. Parties of men turned out to search the forest in every direction, and in turn came back without being able to discover any clue to the mysterious disappearance of Arline and Upton. The tracks of the horses, it is true, had been followed for some distance, but these were at last lost sight of, and the search was finally abandoned as the daydrew near its close. Rumors also of Indians were rife, and as farther efforts to find the lost ones were deemed useless, it was thought more expedient for all to abide by their own homes, as it was uncertain what hour the settlement might be attacked. Guns were overhauled and cleaned, old flints replaced by new. the powder was examined; overh.

And the excitement produced by the report of the Indians being in the rieighborhood, was in nowise allayed by the unaccountable disappearance of the young peo- ple; in fact, connecting it with these reports, a conclusion was arrived at, so satisfactory to the majority, that every precaution was deemed necessary to prevent surprise. But in the house of the clergyman hung a pall of exceed- ing gloom; and the morning and the evening prayers were performed with a peculiar and particular unction, and the throne of grace was most eloquently and earnestly appealed to, to throw its divine protection over the unfortunate wanderers, preserving them from the ruthless vengeance of the foe, and to re- turn them, like stray sheep, again to the fold. Childless themselves, these devout Christians had learned to love Arline like one sprung from their own blood, so much had her simple faith and true heart won upon their affections. Indeed, such was the grief of Mrs. Monroe, that it took all the deep religious philosophy of her husband to console her. How much they blamed them- selves, kind souls, for permitting her to leave the comparative safety of the city for the certain dangers of the wilderness. And so the day waned, and night again came with her sable robes to darken hill and dale. True to his promise, Upton had not disturbed Arline with his presence. He vainly believed that reflection would calm or break her spirits, and lie himself needed all the time to arrange his plans for the future. Several times in the course of the day he had disputed with Newberry, till at last a mutual distrust grew up between them. The tory indeed feared not Upton; but the latter deemed that it would not be an unnatural act if he were betrayed; and this suspicion was in nowise lessened by observing that the two men were often talking together in low tones. In the afterpart of the day, when New- berry proposed that Upton should accompany himself and Jim on a circuit of inspection, the latter, when some distance from the hut, made an excuse to return, sating that he would meet them in an opposite direction, as they re- turned, lir the base of a small hill where there was a spring. To this Upton objected, urging that by keeping together, they were not so liable to surprise. Newberry jeered him at this remark-asked him if he was jealous that such an uncouth monster as Jim might make love to the young woman; or if he supposed they were not better acquainted with the ways of the forest than such a green fellow as himself. Upton had to endure it, though a suspicion arose in his mind, that something was going wrong-with him, at least. lie already began to receive his punishment for the villainy he had concocted; and inwardly he cursed his fate that had failed to procure the object sought. But had he waded so deep for nothing? How was it, then, that he was tor- tured with the bitterest feelings that can be foes of man-Jealousy, Hatred, Suspicion, and Revenge? Conscience! that troubled him not. He had grown up an infidel of the worst dye, from early contracted associations, and holding no responsibility to the future, he believed that this life was but a struggle between man and man, and success belonged to the strong and the subtle. 4  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7034-00000075"/> "8         REBELS AND TORIES. Like a beast of prey, he knew no other objects in life than the gratification of appetites and passions. To Arline the day passed in gloom 'and solitude, only once being visited by Jim, who brought in to her some coarse bread, some water, and a small piece of buck's meat; but she partook of nothing but the water. Dreadful fore- bodings possessed her-the most anxious fears depressed her. She appealed to Heaven, in most imploring accents, to protect her from harm-most espe- cially from the brutal passions of those by whom she was surrounded. Tears flowed freely. as she sobbed aloud in the most heart-broken accents. At times she sat in a most dejected state of apathy. Helpless and unpro- tected, she could do no more than wait, with the most tremulous fear, the result. As Jim placed the portions of her meal before her, and was retiring without speaking, she ventured to address him. "' Are you my enemy, too?" said she., c( Oh, tell me, what am I to expect? Haye you no heart-no sister whom you love-no one of my sex to care for-not even a mother? If you have, oh! for their sake, be a friend to me. I will reward you-you may trust me. I have friends-I have means. Can you do nothing?" Jim paused to look at her as she appealed to him. Was he affected-that "uncouth monster," as Newberry had called him. But he answered her- his voice was not so unpleasant- ' I don't know, Miss, what I could do for you. It's hard, I know-it's wery hard; and I on'y had a hand in it aginst my will. 'Taint nothin' to me, though. I don't git paid nothin' for the job. I'm sorry to see you take on so, Miss, but I don't know what I can de. They'll watch you close enough, I can tell you." Ah! had she touched the sympathies of this rude fellow? Come, encour- agement! "See what you can do for me," said Arline. '"A mouse once gave liberty to a lion. Possibly you have no friends. Tell me how-assist me Ai gain my liberty, and I will never miss a night without praying for you, ancrsomo- time, perhaps-the times you know are so changing-you may need a friend to intercede for you. Will you make me such a friend?" The countenance of the man did not seem so disagreeable as at first. (' You talk pleasantly, Miss," said he. "I'm sure if there's anything in prayers, they might do some good, coining from such a sweet voice." "Then you will assist me," said Arline; " you will promise me?" "I'll see a bit," said he, as he retired and closed t!b, door after him. Was Arline cheered any? Was there room for hope? At least she deemed the apartment not so gloomy as it was. What had been said was like a ray of light gleaming afar through darkness. And so she waited and waited patiently for the working of the charm which she had practised. We said the day passed with only Jim for a visitor. But he came again -this time stealthily into the apartment. Indeed, he was a handsome young man, now, and a pleasant smile glowed all ovor his broad features. Arline   REBELS AND    TORIES.          149 knew that he camne to tell her good news, and for the first titme that day, she smiled herself. "I have thought of a plan, Miss," said he. "I knew you could, if you tried," said Arline, with a most bewitching mnod- slation of voice. i' God bless you! Then you promise to assist me--I shall be free?-do you say so?" "Wcell, I can't assist you much, Miss," said Jim. You must take care of yourself. I suppose you can find the way home? It's a straight road when once you git in it, till you comnle to the Falls; and to git in the road, you must go out yonder." said he, pointing in the 'direction where it lay. '"Thank you, good soul!" exclaimed Arline. ;"But what way ain I to escape?--when--how?" "Oh, I'll leave the door unfastened for you. You see, I'll take it on myself to fasten up to-night, and I won't fasten up. So when it's all dark, and we're all asleep, git up and go out. ff they hear a noise. and ask about it, I'll say, it's me. I'll show you the way now, so you may know." Arline advanced to the door of her own apartment, and Jim pointed out to her, close at her right hand, in the corner of the adjoining room, the outside door of the hut, which was fastened at night by a bar. Two or three steps from her own door would reach it. 1"Could you find it in the dark, now?" asked Jim. "You see all you'll have to do will be to lift the wooden latch." "Yes, I see-I see!" exclaimed Arline. "But why can't I go out now, instead of waiting till dark. It will be so lonesome at midnight, travelling alone through the forest." "Why, Miss, it woulldn't do to go out in daylight. You would soon get caught; and you needn't go out in the dark, neither, if you'd ruther stay where you are. You see, you has your choice." "At night be it, then," said Arline. "But do not deceive me. As you love your soul, do as you have promised me, or I am ruined.:" "D?'t you fear; I'm only sorry that it must be in the night, and that is wery Hismal like. I don't like it myself; but you haint got nothin' to fear, 'cause you are so innocent-like yourself. But when you git safe home, you mustn't forget to pray for me as you said you would. I don't want no more reward. That'll be better than money, I reckon." "Depend upon it, I shall never forget you," said Arline. "And maty my prayers have power to obtain the remission of your sins." "There, now, go in," said Jim, "I dare not talk any more. i; They'll maybe git suspicious if I'm gone long. So good bye!" At the conclusion of these words, he retired and shut the door, and Arline was left to meditate with impatience till the fall of night. Jim joined Newberry and Upton at the promised place, and their round of survey was finished without meeting with any incident to attract their atten- tion. On re-joining them, Upton met him with a glance of inquiry, as sus- picious as it was impertinent; but feeling thabrihis occasion at least, he had done no harm, he cared not for hard looks; and as for Newberry. lie felt convinced that he would not care how soon the girl escaped, as long as he had  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7034-00000076"/> * 150        REBELS AND    TORIES. received pay for the service already rendered. However, as they returned to the hut, the generosity of Newberry was taxed to the extent of producing a black bottle, which he asserted contained choice spirits, and with a few rounds of this and several anecdotes of adventure, the time passed to the hour of re- ' tring, shortly after dark. But the impatience of Upton for the morrow, kept :him awake for some time, and the evening was pretty well advanced before : "c"i c'old give Arline the concerted signal-a slight knock on the door. By 'this' time, however, the moon was begining to rise, and outside there was suffi- cient light for a person to find his way in any direction. In the meanwhile Arline was waiting impatiently-her heart beating from the excitement of hope and the fear of failure. The moments crept by like hours --hours like ages, till at length it seemed as though the expected signal would never be given. By-and-bye, however, when-Jim judged by the ,deep breath- ing of the others, that they were asleep, he rapped softly at the door, and in the next instant, so eager was Arline, it was opened and out she came from her prison. Cautiously she felt her way along the side partition, till she touched the latch of the other door, which swung open almost of its own accord, as soon as the fastening was raised. At the same moment Jim was upon his feet and, standing by her side, he whispered-' Straight forward through the bushes to the road, then turn to your left and hurry away as fast as you can." Perhaps for an instant she hesitated, so timid was she of the night and the gloom of the forest. But her thoughts again recurred to Upton, and motion- ing her thanks to Jim, she ventured forth. Her deliverer watched her till she was lost to sight, then shutting the door, he laid down again upon his bed of skins, and ere long was as forgetful of the incident as deep slumber could possibly make him.  And through the trackless forest pursued Arlipe her way, till she at length came upon the road, and thyn turning to the left, she hurried forward as fast as her, feet could carry her. But how lonesome felt she, without companion or friend, and the wide wilderness all about her! How her heart beat with fear at every shadow, and at every sound of the forest. Anonihe was startled by a fox darting across the road in front of her; then trembbed with fear as the hooting of the owl fell upon her ear, or the screaming of some night-bird. A thousand sounds attracted her attention that she had never before noticed; yet on she sped, cheered with the hopes of home-hurried forward by the desire to put further distance between herself and Upton. CHAPTER XXV. THE GAME OF LIFE AND DEATH. THE savages were astir. The forces of Brant were on their march. The edict of the imperial chief had gone out against the settlement of German Fiatts. Through the intricacies of the forest, from his head quarters on the Susquehanna, wended he his way with his dusky warriors, subtly and slyly   REBELS AND TOKIES.              151 upon his mission of revenge. Already had the inhabitants been doomed by the unrelenting fiat of his will, anld carnage, death, and desolation must have' a long rule, ere the unhappy settlements can again repose in tranquil security. , On the morning following the escape of Arline, at the -time lie sun had risen over the tallest trees of the forest, streaking and dappling with its golden light the green sward and mossy earth beneath, a band of six Indian war- riors, amoela whom was. Wasshemctt, the chief, held council in a grove of trees about four miles from the hut of the Tory Newberry. The object of the council was to decide upon the fate of a prisoner that was bound to a large tree directly in front of the circle of savages. From all appearances, and from the preparations which were made for torture, the victim was a person of consequence, whom the captors took no small pride in having in their pos- session. ile was a man of strong and hardy fiame, apparently innured to all the hardships of forest life, and a countenance indicating the utmost determi- nation and bravery of spihit-an eye piercing and black that quailed not as it returned the fiery glances of his foes. It had been a consultation of hours, evi- dently, and yet no method of torture had been decided on. Wasshemett at length addressed his warriors.  He enumerated the vic- tories he had won and the scalps he had taken. ile then spoke of their wrongs, and the determination of the Indians to arise as one man, and help their great father, the king of England, to destroy his wicked and rebellious children. "We have acted like great braves," said he; "1 and the chief, Thayenda- Aega, has many smiles for his mighty warriors. We have now taken pris- oner the Big Rifle. He has sent many of our tribe to the hnnting grounds of the Michi-Manitou. Ilo is a mighty brave! and his arm is strong and his heart as hard as a flint rock. He will make no cry like a woman, but sing lis death-song like a red man. He sees far in the dark! His arm reaches a great ways for his enemies! He is in many places at once. He is as swift as the deer. His long knife is very sharp! }ie talks to his gun like a friend! It scents the foe a long way! It is too wise, and the red man may not speak to it. Let the great chief have it. He will want it when he is hunting in the far land. Place it by his side. This superstition for tho rifle of the prisoner was natural, and the red man feared that it had the power to *juro them. Therefore, had Wasshemett condemned it to be burned with its owner; but as the Indian to whom the order was given advanced to the tree against which he was to place the rifle, the prisoner, having his legs at liberty, gave him a kick that. sent him reeling with a howl to the ground. This act produced from the rest:of the party a terrific yell of anger, although it was a piece of daring bravery they could not but applaud. But the prostrate savage was soon upon his feet, and quick as thought his tomahawk was flying through the air in the direction of the captive. It touched hIis hair, and stuck in the tree close by his left;temple. It did, how- ever, all the execution intended; for it is one-of the cdustores' of this people, that their prisoners, when sentenced to death, must undergo all the most lingeringI modes of torture which their ingenuity can devise. particularly, if  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7034-00000077"/> 162        REB'ELS AND TORIES. the object of their revenge' be a person of distinction. Applause from his companions followed this demonstration of the infuriated man; but in the countenance of the captive no trace of an emotion could be seen, unless one might have noticed about his lips a smile of mingled scorn and defiance. :' Dog of a forgotten race!" he exclaimed, "wild Ingin of the forest! If you expect to see my eyes wink at your cowardly tricks, you've chased the wrong 'possum up the tree this time. In a fair fight I could kill a legion of you!"     . "The white brave sings in triumph," said Wasshemett. ; He shall tell of his scalps, and the red Xaen he has slain. Our ears are open." "Hundreds of ye. ye red levils!" exclaimed the prisoner. "Wild cata- mounts and grizzly bears aint half so pisen! Put Tom in my hands and I'll defy your whole dirty tribe!"  Another tomahawk was now flung at the victim, striking the tree just above his head.                        ! "Cowardly fools! do you think I am a dog that I must beg my life? lHow many of your young men have I killed? More than a regiment--many of them I cut their throats as they slept!" "You shall die," said Wasshemett; "for the spirits of our red brothers whom you have slain, fill the air; and all overhead among the trees, they sit to hear the death-song of the Big Rifle." "You lie!" exclaimed the prisoner. "There aintno more soul in an Ingin than in Tom, thar-no, nor half so much, I beg his pardon; and I wouldn't think no more of cuttin' the throat of your whole tribe than of killin so many musketers. Fire away you mud colored dogs!" "' The pale-face is very brave," said Wasshemett. "He sings his song like one whose heart is hard. In the great hunting grounds beyond the moon he will meet many great chiefs, who shall take their white brother by the hand and show him the place of springs, and the place of lakes, where the deer and the moose herd in large droves on the broad prairies, and where the lodge of the hunter never wants for venison." i, Ingin! I spit- at you, and defy you! Give my arms freedom, and if I can't lick the -whole bilin' of you, my name aint Murphy. Cowards, all of ye. You can't take an enemy in fair fight, but must crawl on him when he's asleep, or go skulkin' behind stumps and trees like a skunk sneakin' round arter a hin's neest! Oh, I aint afeard on ye! Ye may flourish your toma- hawks, and finger your gun-locks as muchl as you please. You aint agoin' to 'drive me to a confession of cowardice, cause I wont! I know vou are maskin a pretty calculation of having a nice time a torturin' me; but you'd better take my advice and kill me at once, for if I do git my liberty, (and it aint an unlikely thing, for I've bin in as bad scrapes as this,) I'll raise sech a howlin' tempest about your heads you'll think the sky is agoin' to tumble down! I put my mark on a few of ye, ye yelpin' devils!" "It is a long journey my brother must take to reach the hunting grounds," said Wasshemett. V But you will meet there many braves who have gone before you-who have travelled the dark passage in their canoes. You will carry them the good news that Wasshemett has already a great many scalps   REBELS AND TORIES.              153 in his wigwam; that he hopes before the red hatchet be buried, he shall take many more. They are scalps from the heads of braves whom he has slain in battle. We have many wa   rriors yet, tell them; and our young men upon the war-path are making the hEarts of their fathers glad with brave deeds. We axe sorry that we cannot take you to the big lodge of the nation. We should have a great feast-a great dance, and our warriors should hear you tell of your bravd actions; and our squaws and our papooses should honor you with much torture. We are sorry, for you are a great chief and deserve more than we are Cable to give. . But we dare not trust you. You are very cunning, and might escape. You are very strong, and might puzzle the hanldsof our young men. But we will do our best, and the Big Rifle must not complain." "Ingin, you shall be cut to pieces!" said Murphy. "Your flesh shall be fed to dogs, and y our bones rot unburied. I cus ye and dispise eo, and may my tongue be-blistered if I please ye so much as to speak to ye agin on the subject." This resolution was made on the part of Murphy for the reason that he knew it would please them to hear him talk; and he determined not to gratify them further by singing his ': death-song," as they termed it. His fate was decided upon-of that he was aware; and he had no expectation of escaping a most exquisite species of torture, without the special interposition of Provi- dence, and of that he saw nothing to give him hope, though, as he had told them himself, he had been as critically situated on a previous occasion. The savage who had thrown the last tomahawk now stepped forward to take it from the tree over Murphy's head, where it had stuck; but too cau- tious to put himself in the vicinity of the prisoner's feet, he approached him from behind but as he reached forward to take the weapon. Murphy turned his heatx and spat full in his eyes. A howl of rage followed that started the birds from their nests, and Murphy, in spite of his situation, burst into a fit of laughter. "By the blood of my father! I warn't agoin' to speak agin. But ye red sarpcnt, how d'ye like that, eh? Good for sore eyes, aint it? * That is the real plug tobacka, of the best kind, and I warrant the juice is strong. I don't want to be partial, so if the rest of you tee-totum fightin' men will jest step along, I'll sarve you the same way." The savage upon whom this infliction of tobacco juice had fallen, seemed for a moment or two to writhe in extreme pain, which so madened him, that, forgetting all his previously anticipated luxury of torture, with one bound, he sprang forward to Murphy, with the intention of wreaking his vengeance by the instant destruction of the prisoner. Flourishing his weapon over his head, he rushed upon his intended victim, who, naturally and instinctively shrinking from the blow directed at his head, the keen-edged hatchet de- asended to his side, inflicting a slight, though painful wound; at the samet instant, however, Murphy felt his bonds relax, and springing forward he seized his rifle and with one well-directed blow with the breech, he felled the savage to the earth. All was now consternation. The rashness of one of their number had liberated their most dreaded enemy, who, :s he stood before them armed with his good doulble-barrcled rifle. wast a pretty fuit  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7034-00000078"/> 154         REBELS AND TORIES. mitch for the five savages who stood before him. Bringing his weapon to his shoulder, Murphy brought it to bear upon the group before him, and as the sight of the piece fell upon -the tall figure of the chief, Wasshemett, he said: "Now come on, you red hounds of the devil! and you shall hear a d4ath- song that you didn't bargain for! Oh, you needn't begin to. squirm, now; nor you, nor you. Now you may pile the faggots and put ou the torture, but I guess you'll find that Torn, here. has got something to say about the matter. Come, peal up your loud anthems, chief, for th3m 'ere blackguard spirits that you were talking so much about jist now, will be likely to catch a visit from you sooner than you guessed for, I reckon." The awe of the savages, as they saw that dreadful weapon pointed at them, may be imagined. Too well they were aware of its character not to feel a superstitious hornor as thlly saw it aimed amongst them. Many an account had reached them  respecting its fatal execution; and they well knew that when it had. once marked an encemy, the result was as certain as it was speedy. To fly, therefore, was not the first thought of the Indians; and they wqre convinced that delay would be positively fatal to some of them. Spring- ing aside, Wasshemot shouted his war-cry, and his companions in an instant prepared to terminate the scene. Their guns were already pointed at him, when the discharge of both barrels of his piece laid two of his enemies upon the ground, in the agonies of deatli, at the same time springing behind the tree to which he had been bound, and whichl received the balls of his remaining foes. There were but three left to eptend with, for the savage whom he had knocked down, still lay senseless. Ilis situation was less critical than at first. He now began to re-load his rifle, the Indians following his example, and per- haps the contest belonged to the most expert party, and it was apparent that the advantage was on the side of NMurphy, for, cool as though loading for a deer, his hand trembled not with excitement, nor did his countenance change a muscle fromn its usual calmness. "And now, you  wild heathen."  ,said Murphy, "if you don't run like thieves, I shall be ready for another brace of you in about a minute." Scarcely were these words out of his mouth ere the report of a gun sounded in a  part of the forest on his left, and another of his enemies bit the dust. At this unexpected turn of ofairs the remaining- two took to their heels, illustrat- ing this fact: that even the Indian occasionally thinks that "the better part of valor is discretion," and that " he who fights and runs away, will live to fight another day." "Well," said Murphy, as he saw Wasshemett and his sole remaining com- panion disappear, " if you aint agoin' to wait for compliments, I shan't run after you; but it aint natural to expect manners tm a red Ingin. Come now, if here ain't as pretty a sight as I've seen for some time, I'll not be a constituted judge. Sing my death song, eh! Well, this looks mighty like it anyhow;   and I guess if I only had somebody to help me, I might get up a grand powwow on this occashin. Here, nowis the critter that Tom hit over the head with his but-eend. Bless iijysoul and body! but I didn't think that I  struck sich blows. Skull clean smashed in, I vow! and his mouth 'chock full of dirt. Well, a dead tngin aint of much account, nor a live one   REBELS AND TORIES.             155 either.

There aint but one man that hits the mark that way. The ball has struck him right in the teeth. It must be a sartainty that the Wild Medicine is about; and if lie, is, and passes an old friend without speaking, it's a sulbject to be wrothy on. as I'm thinkin .?" These remarks were made by Murphy, as he examined the bodies of the savages in succession; and from the peculiarity of the wound on the person of the last one who had fallen, he was convinced titat the Wild Medicine must be in the vicinity, as it was a peculiarity of that individual to shoot his victims in the mouth.  But he was not long in donbt, for looking about to discover whence the shot came, he saw Wild Medicine approaching. "Well, Wild Medicine," said Murphy, extending a hand to him, ; you scenl always to drop into the ball in time for a figure.  What roaming has brought you in the way this time?" "Why goes the hawk to his prey? Is there rest-is there peace for the weary-loaded?  From the far borders of the forest to the haunts of the bad- ger my feet stray." "But you took a good job out of my hands.  Why did you frighten away, the Ingins?" " Is the Rifle tired of his scalp? You have done good work enough. I was unseen, and my victim was sure, and I knew the red wolves would run as soon as they felt danger from a secret quarter." "Well, I thank you, Wild Medicine. We have had the Ingin on our trail afore now, and we hain't ft for one another for nothin' not to stand up to the mark when called on." "Let boys talk of their exploits, men must act. Leave these to the crows; we have a long trail to follow, and the forest-paths are weary and slow. When the sun set last night I was in Cherry Valley." "Ah! and I'll warrant was treated like a prince. I shall be jealous of you. Well, how is the old minister, and Missis, and the gal?" ' There is- grief in the house and mourning in the settlement.

This morning I was on the trail. I tracked them to an old hut yonder in the woods; but it was deserted, though occupied but a few hours before. The people in the settlement think the I,-  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7034-00000079"/> 156         REBELS AND    TORIES. dians have a hand in the business, but I know better, there is a plotter deeper than they." This was startling information to Murphy. He had been touched with much sympathy for the lonesome situation of Arline-comparatively unpro- tected. Her exceeding pleasantness of disposition and sincerity of heart had won upon him, and having been her preserver and protector, he was quick in discovering a growth of affection for her, which a visit or two had strengthened. "What do you tell me!" he exclaimed. "Is the gal gone for airnest- taken away by force! It's likely work for an Ingin-or a Tory. And the city chap gone too?" "Both went at the same time," said Wild Medicine. "But the mischief is of his own making." "What makes you think so?" "I will not tell you yet. I am sure." "Well, if I get rompin' mad, it wouldn't do for me to fall afoul of the head of this business. It's as much as a man's life is worth to lay a finger on that gal; and I'll follow up the trail till I know which .way the quarry is. Woe to wild Ingin or white rebel that injures the down of her cheek! Up hill and down, through forest and meadow, across rivers and lakes, I'll follow till my hair grows gray, and I've no feet to walk on, or I'll find the gal and have revenge. "; If such is your resolution, let us go first to the hut, and possibly we may fall on the trail from there. I am with you on the hunt, and be it night or day will never leave you till we have rdstored the girl, or learned her fate."   . "I'm gla:son it, Wild Medicine; for I know you've a bold and true heart, and care neither for Ingin or devil. So come on. Let us lose not a minute by gabbling about what we will do, but do at once. Forrerd-march!" With these words they both set out, in the direction of the hut, and while they are reaching it, let us give the reason why it had been so hastily vacated, as stated by the Wild Medicine. There were many hard words between Newberry and Upton, when, in the morning, it was discovered that Arline had escaped. Jim was questioned, but he denied all knowledge of the case. Upton accused them of dishonest treat- ment toward him; and Newberry more than hinted that if he was disposed to be quarrelsome, himself and Jim would not find it a difficult job to use him according to their convenience-a job for which he had money enough to pay handsomely. This hint was forcible, and Upton, although he could not hide his evident distrust, thought it safer for him to keep a prudent tongue. Arline, by this time, he thought, was probably back in the settle- ment, where her story had been told, and where; of course it would not be safe for him to appear again. This vexatious state of affairs was the cause of some considerable merriment on the part of Newberry and Jim, and Upton was at last induced to take the Tory's advice, somewhat m aliciously given, that it would be an act of policy on his part to withdraw for at season to a   REBELS AND TORIES.         1-' C   57 more remote part of the country-at least farther from the i'mmediate vicinity of Cherry Valley. Many expressions of respect were lavished upon him as he rode from the hut, and taking a course, fot the M ohawk, he was soon lost to their sight, and congratulated himself A deal that he had gotten rid of such bad company without the cermony of being robbed; but his reflections on the failure of his plot againt Arline were of a natue so unpleasant that he cursed his unlucky folly as the mad conceit of a fool As soon as ho had de- parted, there was an unusual 16ustle about the hut for the space of' half an hour; and then. well armed, wiAti asmall pack!upon their backs, Newberry and Jim struck off into the depths of theorest, leaving, the place tenantless and solitary.  In the meantime, all who went out from Cherry Valley, in search of Arline, returned hopeless, having met with no success; and as rumors began to mul- tiply respecting large bodies of Indians that were piowling about, it was deemed impolitic for the inhabitants to stray far beyond the precincts of their own settlement, as in case of attack, all their forces would be needed to de- fend themselves. Therefore the young woman was given up for lost, and mourned with sincerity. But the clergymain and his wife were inconsolable.  '   - CHAPTER XXVI.        j  TIIE iiECOVERED TREASURE.  ABOUT a week after the occurrences.-eclated in the precedir chapter, on a j morning at the close of August, as the first rays of the su fell upon the bosom of Otsego Lake, two men might have been'seen, sittin upon its green margin, partially screened from the view of the water by the low branches of a clump of bushes. They were each well armed. and were apparently watch- ing the movements of some object on the surface of the lake. "Well," said one of them, " do you make out yet what it is-or if it is the party we seek?" "No, for the boat keeps so right in the glare of the sunlight, that I can't tell if there be two, or three, or half a doz', persons in it." "It must be them, thoughl," said the rflt -speaker; " for we haint follered 'em for a week through purgatory for nothin'. I'm bound to fetch 'cm at last, so they may jist as well come along now as,wait. It'll only make it the worse for 'cma, I reckon." "Now I can see better," said his companion. l'The boat is just on the edge of the sunlight, and I can make out three figures in her." "It's thejm, then, Wild Medicine, or I'll never agin fire a shot. As sure as you've got a nose. I see a petticoat." "You have good eyes, Murphy, but it may be the kilt of an Indian." "Look here, old chap, none of your tantalizin' talk, now. Don't you s'pose I've got as much gumption as a bear? I tell you there are two Ingins and a petticoat in that 'ere boat; and if the petticoat aint a squaw, what is it?" i              ,  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7034-00000080"/> 15138         REBELS  AND  TORIES. "They are crossing the lake in this direction , and if it should be the party we are after, we had better keep out of sight till they land." "You're right. These bushes will hide us fast enough; so jist examine the primin' of your gun, for I wouldn't have 'em miss fire this time for all the continental army; though I'll give Tom the credit of bein' allers ready for an Ingin. Juhu! if I could meet the cantankerous devil that run away with the gal in the fust place, I wouldn't mind puttin' him to a little tortur before I blew his gizzard o%#." : I think you. are right, Murphy; for I believe that we have discovered the game at last. Step back a little-step back." "Believe! I knew it. Can't I tell a white gal from the dirty squaw of an Ingin, if it's pitch dark and she aint within forty miles? Now here they come, a-singin' like a squeakin' cartwheel. There's jist an Ingin apiece, Wild Medicine. Take 'em as they land, and be careful not to hit the gal. But I needn't say that to one of the primest shots in the forest." "You may trust me to that, Murphy;" and only name where I shall touch him, and you shall be accommodated." "Oh, take your old shot, and I'll warrant he'll never sing in another yelpin' chorus. Now what d'ye say? You can see the whites of their eyes; and the poor, pale critter sittin' between 'em looks more like a corpse a-goin' a visitin', than a livin' cretur." Murphy and the Wild Medicine now stepped back a few paces, in order to be more fully screened from the view of those who approached in the boat. As they neared the shore, their chaunt-like song ceased, and the canoe was beached in the most perfect silence, and the party commenced making their preparations to step ashore, First an Indian left the boat, leading by the hand a white maiden. Her appearance indicated the most severe treatment. Her feet were nearly bare, her clothes torn in many places, while about her shoulders hung in uncombed locks her abundant tresses. Tears, indeed, were not in her eyes; but her pallid cheeks indicated the most forlorn sorrow. For what dreadful sacrifice she was intended, was beyond her imagination to foretell, but at least she-had fully made up her mind to submit to her fate without farther murmur or supplication, as she knew that any appeal would be in vain, and that the savage was beyond the reach of pity. The second Indian prepared to follow, and his foot was on the side of the boat. At this moment the following conversation took place between Murphy and the Wild Medicine: "Now friend," said the former, " now for your shot! That is she-that is Arline! Are you ready? One, two---" "Iush!" exclaimed Wild Medicine. "Wait till he raises his head. The game is ours, but I want to do it like a true sportsman. Let me break a twig and attract their attention till I can catch their eyes. This will do- this will do." At the same time Wild Medicine trod upon a dry stick about the thickness of his thumb, which broke with just sufficient noise to be heard by the savages, who paused for an instant with the most apparent anxiety, their eyes riveted upon the spot whence proceeded the noise. This was what Wild Medicine   REBELS AND    TQRIES.           159 desired, for nodding to Murphy, he run his eye along his rifle to the sight, and pulled the trigger, and the simultaneous crack of both pieces could scarcely be distinguished from one report, as the two savages fell headlong-one over the side of the boat into the water, the other, shot through the head-by the ball of Murphy, at the feet of the captive maiden, who stood amazed, but un- moved, at this unexpected turn of affairs. Rushing forward from their covert, the two brave men were at once recog- nized by the maiden, and Murphy experienced the joy of once more clasping the hands of Arline, and for the second time standing in her presence as her preserver. tier gratitude knew no bounds, and for the first time for days she was relieved by a passionate flow of tears. Oh, it was a glad meeting, and questions were asked on both sides faster than answered. "'What can I do for you? how can I thank you?" said Arline. ": For the second time you brave men have saved me from great peril. Where will you get recompense?" "Why does the rain fall to fertilize the valleys? why shines the everlast- ing sun to ripen the harvest?" said Wild Medicine. "Good or kind acts are only so when freely dispensed. It pleases us that we have been able to serve you." "the Wild Medicine is right," said Murphy. "We don't want reward, no more than to see you look smilin' and happy agin. You don't spose I vallies a tramp, or a charge of powder? No! I couldn't do without 'cm. And as for fightin' the Ingin, that comes jest as natural as for a hawk to light on a pigeon. But come; you can't be in none of the best order. I guess we've got a snack of somethin' in our pouches that maybe 'll do you good, and make you feel smart. Come, Wild Medicine; let's have somethin' to eat. I feel sharp-set as a wolf, myself; and while we are doin' a little for the sake of the stomach, Arline here shall tell us her story. and how we came to find her here." "Yes," said his companion; " but we must make short rests, for the In- dians are out, and we've a smart tramp yet to reach the settlement." ("Well, we've a day afore us," said Murphy; " and its a pity if we can't git into quarters by dark;, though I aint capable of sayin' how far these little feet here can tramp in a day." "I am so used to it by this time," said Arline, : that I think I could easily travel a much greater distance. Besides, I have rested since last evening, having this morning only come from the opposite side of the lake." "I'll warrant it," said Murphy, " if you've bin kept a-goin' with the Ingins, for they aint slow footed." The little preparations for their rude meal were now completed. It con- sisted of dried meats, a few biscuits, and a little whiskey. Of the latter, how- ever, Arline refused to partake, though Murphy insisted that a few drops would give her new strength for her journey. "But if you wont," said he, "I shant quarrel with you for it; and so, if you'll obleege us by tellin' the history of your wanderin's, we should like to I , hear; and if you please don't forgit to tell us the name of the scoundrelly villain that stole you away from home,"  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7034-00000081"/> 1A0         REBELS AND TORIES. Thus importuned, Arline commenced to relate the account of her sufferings up to the Moment of her rescue.            b She detailed minutely all the incidents of her captivity, which we already know, to the time of her escape from the hut of Newberry, drawing forth from her listeners many expressions of surprise and threats of revenge. On hearing the connection which Upton had with the affair, Murphy said: "(I knew it! I foretold a villain as soon as I looked in his vissage-a cold, malicious, thieving eye! He will keep himself out of my reach, for I'll make as many pieces of him as will feed to each cartrion crow in the country.") This information, however, did not seem to create much surprise on the part of the Wild Medicine, though he murmured in an almost indistinct voice: "Child of bad omens! why does the curse for ever follow thee? I can see thy end in a dim shadow, and thy doom is awful! No! (and he here raised his voice to a loud hoarse pitch) No.! he has darker crimes to meditate. The s irit of murdered innocence, cries unavenged! The first crime shall claim it victim, what though it was dark, what though no eye saw, what though no ear heard the gurgling cry for mercy! No! on the black book of doom is the suntence recorded! and accursed spirits are deputed to watch that no hair of his head falls! Pass him along! pass him along! For there's blight in his eye, poison in his touch, death in his acts! Let him live with the hot iron of conscience writhing in his bosom like a living serpent!" "If he's, to be tortured like that, Wild Medicine," said Murphy, " may he live for ever and ever. But he must keep out of my sight. The other two chaps, as Arline says, he got to hlp him, by the description, must be the Tory Newberry and Jim Moody. The gallus'll catch him bime by; and as for the good turn of Jim, I wish him in better company. Now go on, Miss." "After I had left the hut," continued Arline,' "though it was dark, and I had the prospect to wander alone in the forest, I felt cheerful and full of hope, for I was flying toward home as fast as my feet could carry me. I cared not for the solitude, nor the darkness around me, so long as I had once more re- gained my freedom. But alas! how soon was I doomed to more disappoint- ment! I had travelled, I suppose, for an hour, when I paused for a moment to catch breath. I had no sooner done so, however, than my ear was at- tracted by the rustling of bushes near me, and in the next instant I was in the power of; two Indians-the same whom you have just released me from. I shrieked in despair, begged for mercy, promised reward, but all in vain. I was hurried off into the denser paxt of the forest, and compelled, by beating, to hurry along for an hour, at the same speed as my inhuman captors. At the end of this time they paused, and tying my hanmds and feet, threw themselves upon the ground and went to sleep. How long and tedious seemed the night! how painful my emotions! Thus was I forced to lie upon the cold earth for the rest of the night, my hands and my feet suffering the most intense pain by the tightness of the cords which bound them. By daylight the next morning we were astir agin; and after partaking of I Aight refreshment prepared , . ,   REBELS   AND  TORIES.          161 from some pounded corn, the savages commenced again their tramp, driving me along as before. Almost at every step niy clothes were torn by the bushes, and my shoes, which'were thin, began to give way. Thus we travel- led for the whole of this day, though several times I was on the point of fall- ing from fatigue; but whenever I showed the'least sign of faltering, they would beat me to urge me along the faster. A short time after sunset, we arrived at an Indian camp which had the appearance of having been recently occupied. Here I was again bound, and underwent the same treatment as the night before, only I was -allowed a blanket to lie on. Here they stayed for three days; for what reason I do not know, as I could not understand any- thing that they said. Sometimes one of the savages was absent from the camp for hours. I was scarcely noticed all this while, except to give me por- tions of some wild birds which they shot. I thought they were waiting for the return of some party which they expected to meet here. They held long arguments with each other, and at one time . expected to see a fight between them. Ah! you may judge if I did rot then think of the fate of poor Jane McCrea! But through a merciful Providence I Was preserved. On the mor- ning of the fifth day of my captivity, the march was again resumed; and this was but a repetition of the sufferings of previous days, and I began to get ex- cessively weak from the want of proper nourishment, and for the reason that' I had scarcely slept a wink during the whole period. That night, which was last night, we encamped on the opposite side of the lake; and here we found an old house to shelter us, and some pieces of dried venison to eat, which con- siderably refreshed me, so that, being completely worn with fatigue and sorrow, I was enabled to get a few hours' comfortable sleep. Early in the morning, however, I was awakened, and forced forward to the margin of the lake, where a canoe had been dragged from the buihes. I was ordered to get in, and the boat put off for this shore, where it is impossible to tell what other sufferings awaited me, had it not been for your opportune presence that has thus rescued me a second time from captivity." As Arline concluded her narrative. Murphy sprang to his feet, exclaim- ing:- "Yes; and there the red sarpents are, in satisfaction for all they have done, and so be it done to all that had a hand in the business. But come; we have finished our breakfast, so let us prepare for a tramp on our own hook. And as your little feet are almost bare, here are some rags, sich as I always carry for bandages; and in place of somethin' better maybe you'll accept 'em, and I'm sure if they could feel pride, they'd be proud of their duty in so doin'? As for Wild Medicine, here, he is moon struck agin, and you wont git a word out of him for a month." "There is a time for words, and a time for actions," said Wild Medicine; "a time for weeping, and a time for vengence! Let the wind blow! Let the wind blow!" "Of course I will," said Murphy. "Who hinders it, if its a-inind to?" The party were soon in readiness to resume the return march; though, ow- ing to the weakness of Arline, they were compelled to pass another night in the forest; but the next day, long ere noon, they arrived safely at Cherry Valley, " Y^  &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7034-00000082"/> 162         REBELS  AND  TORIES, tothe delight of the inhabitants, and the infinite joy of the clergyman and his wife. They were not satisfied with their manifestations of pleasure, but she must be kissed and embraced again and again by the good lady; and even the dominie himself had to beg the privilege of a similar expression of joy. All the neighbors thronged to see and welcome her, and she had to rehearse the Story of her adventures several times over. As for Murphy and the Wild Medicine, nothing too good was there for them. Applause and blessings were showered in profusion upon them, and the women discoveredfor the first time that the rifleman was a brave and handsome fellow; and they vowed that one so able to protect a comely young woman, should have the best reward the world could give him-a woman's heart. And the bold re- ligious men of that day forgot not, in their prayers, to return the most earnest thanks for the preservation of the young woman, and to crave the special pro- tection of Heaven for the brave men who had rendered, not for the first time, so essential a service to humanity. CHAPTER XXVII. A BIT OF HSTORY, WITH SOME LINKING OF THE NARATIVE. THn reports of Indian depredations began now to assume a shape of reality, and the inhabitants of Cherry Valley could not foretell the day of their own adversities, but were kept in a state of continual alarm which was not at all lessened by the intelligence from German Flatts,* the inhabitants of which place, becoming suspicious of the movements of Brant, had sent out scouts in the direction of Unadilla to watch his movements. But the wily chieftain had already commenced his march, and three of these men were killed, the fourth escaping to carry the news that Brant was already in the immediate vicinity of the place with a large force of Indians and Tories. Consternation spread throughout the settlement, and the inhabitants, gathering up all their convenient movables, took to their boats upon the river, and thus escaped to the forts. leaving their dwellings, flocks and herds to be destroyed by the savages. The night came on dark and stormy, and Brant arrived at the outskirts of the village in the evening, and put up at the house of a tory friend. In the morning, finding that the inhabitants had escaped, the torch was applied to their dwellings and their barns; and when the flames had made complete their work of devastation, the hostile hordes overrun the fields, destroying the harvest, and driving off or killing all the horses, sheep and black-cattle, thus in a few hours completing the destruction of one hundred and twenty- five buildings, including three grist and two saw-mills, spread over a space of miles This melancholy spectacle was witnessed from the forts, by the very families who were thus deprived of their homes.

REBELS   AND TORIES.           163 knew no bounds, disappointed as they were that not a solitary scalp graced their belts, and that the strength of the forts, and their lack of the necessary arms, rendered an attack against them out of the question. Cloyed at length with the work of destruction, or finding nothing for their hands to do, the savages gathered up their booty and departed. When too late, they were followed by a body of about three hundred militia-men, but these accomplished nothing more than finding the bodies of the'three scouts, and giving them burial. But a party of Oneidas made an attack upon one of the settlements of the enemy on the Unadilla, burnt some of their houses, took a few prisoners, and recovered some of the property that had been taken from German Flatts,  In retaliation, however, for the expedition of Brant, Colonel William But- tler, with one of the Pennsylvania regiments, and a detachment of Morgan's Rifles, among whom was Murphy, made an incursion into the country of the enemy, destroying their chief towns of Unadilla and Oghkwaga. The Indians however, had mostly fled, though they took as prisoners some Tories, and destroyed large quantities of produce and cattle, vegetables and poultry. This had been a fatiguing expedition, the forces marching from Schoharie to the head waters of the Delaware, thence across to the Susquehanna, the men being compelled to carry their provisions on their back, to ford streams, and encamp at night on the wet and cold ground. But its results, were severely felt by the foe, and measures of revenge were soon plotted, which fell with a ten fold retaliation upon the white settlements; and though for a time the inhabitants of Cherry Valley slumbered unmolested, they were already marked out as the victims of savage vengeance. In the meantime Murphy had but few opportunities of visiting his friends, so much was he occupied with the trail of the Indian, or the expeditions of the Rifles. Already was his name a by-word of terror among the savages, and they were superstitious enough to believe that he had the power of being in several places at once, so quick were his movements. That he bore a charmed life they all believed, as many of them had asserted that they had often fired at him without effect; and they had heard him talk so much to his rifle that they believed it contained a spirit. But if he had a charm upon his life at all, it was in the affection that he every day found growing stronger and stronger for Arline. Though he had never openly spoke of love to her, nor had he reason to believe that she thought of him in any other light than that of friend- ship, still it was to him an imaginary happiness-the idea that some day, when the wars were over, she might love him. He was too manly and re- gardful of her happiness, even if he had known that she would love him, to have entirely won her heart, when his own was so divided betwixt herself and his country; and if it should be his fate to fall in the struggle for liberty, he cared not to leave a widowed heart behind. Under ordinary circumstances it is probable that Arline might have looked upon the bold figure of the rifle- man with more than common interest, especially in consideration of the ser- vices he had rendered her; and so he lived in hope; and while he was rang- ing the forest in company with the Wild Medicine, multiplying his adventures day, by day, the inhabitants of Chery Valley settlement were remonstrating  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7034-00000083"/> 164         REBELS AND    TORIES. against the insufficien' protection of the forces in the fort, and foretelling the most dreadful results in case of attack; and thus several weeks passed away, until they heard with satisfaction that Brant was about removing to winter quarters in Canada. CHAPTER XXVIII. TORY AND INDIAN. WE now open the scene of our narrative about two months after the affair at German Flatts. 'In the summer of 1777, Walter N. Butler, notorious for his connection with the disasters of the Mohawk country in the war of the Revolution, was taken within the American lines in- the act of inviting the people to treason, for which he was tried and sentenced to death; but owing to the respectability of his family, and the inrfluence of his friends in Albany, in which place he had been educated to the profession of the law, he received a reprieve from General Arnold, and he was ordered into rigorous confiement until the following spring.  Feigning to be sick, howeveri through the influence of General Lafayette, his quarters were changed to the residence of a friend, where he was guarded by a single sentinel. This family were Tories, and suspecting the corruptibility of the sentinel, they plied him well with liquor, and on one of these occasions, having succeeded in making him drunk, they provided for Butler a horse on which he escaped, and succeeded in joining his father at Niagara sometime in July, 1778. Being of an irascible and violent temper, his treatment while a prisoner so preyed upon him, that when he again entered the service of the crown he was burning with a terrible thirst for re- venge, and with this view he exerted all his influence with such of the Indians as were peaceably disposed toward the Americans, to irritate them into acts of hostility,--and more particularly with the Senecas, whose chief, The Great Tree, had given Washington frequent assurances of their friendship. But in spite of the influence of their chieftain, when he returned from the head-quar- ters of the Commander-in-chief, he found his tribe in arms in consequence of a report having been spread among them that the Americans contemplated an expedition against their country. There is no doubt that this report, false as it was, owed its origin to Walter Butler, though at the time many suspected the influence to be Brant's. At the time of Juniper's interview with Sir Henry Clinton, as related in chapter ten, the latter expected, from a letter which he had'received from Butler, that he would be in the neighborhood of Cherry Valley by the time that his messenger arrived; but one event and another detain3 him till Oc- tober, before he left Niagara. 'It was a fine autumnal evening that Butler with his Rangers encamped on the borders of Cayuga lake, a few miles north of the present village of Ithaca. The number amounted to about two hundred men well armed and accoutred for the desperate service upon which they were bent. They were picketed in   REBELS AN-D   TORIES.          165 groups, or messes, one of which was composed of Butler and a few of his most trusty officers. A gloom rested upon the brow of their leader, as he paced back and forth before them, the expression of which, however, was not as in- dicative of despondency as of some desperate resolution. Turning sha'rply to one of his companions, and folding his arms upon his chest as he looked him in the face, he said, somewhat bitterly, "Well, Mason. we are nearer the point of our destination than the infernal rebels wot of; and by God's grace we shall be able to teach them in a few days better manners than to throw one of his majesty's servants, and a gen- tleman, into a vile jail to be guarded by clod-hoppers and breechless loons?" "If there is anything in dreams, Captain, I am sure we. shall," said Mason; "for last night--- "To the imp with your dreams! Give me realities. However, if my plans succeed only half as well as I have laid them out, there-will be no lacking of success. But I can't ilagine where Brant lingers. AMy commission em- powers me to employ his forces; and I hoped to meet him on his return to winter quarters ere we had reached as far as this." "Perhaps,"' said Mason, "he has taken another route." "That is not possible; and if it were, should I not receive intelligence from the runners and scouts which I have sent out to intercept him?" "Still they may have missed him: for these you only sent out yesterday, and he may have left the Susquchanna country sooner than you expected." "That is not possible, either. My information concerning the day of his departure from Susquehanna is to be relied upon; besides, the chieftain is so regular and systematic in his movements, that 'there can be no difficulty for one at all acquainted with his character, in keeping informed of his plans." "But how will he relish a subordinate station to yourself? You know that he throws away no love upon you." "What care I fbr his love, more than I fear his enmity? As long as I can make use of him, may I not be satisfied?" "To be sure you may, if you can use him; but I have no faith in his tracta- bility, more than I have in your own immaculate virtues-- beg your pardon --I mean your love for the rebel." "I shall not ask your faith, Mason, you may depend upon it. When I need you, I shall only be pleased to see you clever with your weapon." "Well, Captain, you are the best judge of my ability in such matters, as we have fought side by side in more than one desperate combat, and some of them hand to hand ones. But I will tell you what I don't relish exactly-this stealthy marching upon the unsuspecting hamlet, and putting to the sword women and innocent children." "No, nor you wouldn't kill young snakes, but leave them to breed more reptiles," said Butler, half in anger. "But we need not dabble our hands in such gore, while we have wild Indians enough to take such blusiness off them. There will be stout mettle enough for ourselves to handle, never you fear." "But the employment of these unconscionable butchers is as bad as doing it ourselves. and perhaps worse, for with them no act of inhumanity will cause  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7034-00000084"/> 166         REBELS AND TORIES. them to shudder or pause at their attrocities. We sometimes might spare-- they seldom or never." "Well; Mason, you had better preserve your humanity for fHis Majesty. Go to court. It needs an honest and fearless counsellor." Saying this, Butler turned to go away, and as he did so was met by one whose garments and person indicated a severe journey. Presenting himself, he inquired if he stood in the presence of Captain Walter N. Butler, and on receiving a reply in the affirmative, he said: "I expected to have seen you at Cherry Valley about the first of August, as I had instructions to seek you there from Sir Henry Clinton, from whom I bAought letters." "Where are they?" asked Butler, with a feigned impatience. "On my way up, when above. Shenectady, I was met by Brant, who told me that I could not see you, at the same time demanding the letters," said the stranger. "And being thus unceremoniously relieved of my mission, I have been engaged in other business since instead of seeking you." "Ah, that is well enough. I received them by a messenger all in proper time. Do you know the object of the messages or letter which you brought?" "No." " Very well. Your name is---" "You may call me Juniper, at your service," said the young man. "Juniper-ah, I remember, that was the name mentioned in Sir Henry's letter. How go affairs in the city?-at least how went they when you left." "The rebels seem as though they faltered, and Cunningham is doing his best to extinguish the flames of liberty. Many go to prison daily, and that is the last of them. There are many doors to enter, but only one to go out from-or one way'of getting out." He's a precious scoundrel, that Cunningham; and I shouldn't at all won- der if, when there is nothing more for him to do, he left the prison by the same door through which he sends so many of his guests. Sir Henry was well when you left him, I suppose?" "Yes; though perhaps a little out of temper at the success of Washington at Monmouth, or perhaps, to speak more correctly, at the want of success on the part of the British army." "Well, the old gentleman must not lose his temper, so we will even do something to please him in this section of the country. Do you join us in this expedition?" "As a volunteer," said Juniper, " with the privilege of quitting your servioe as soon as I am tired of it." "Queer terms these; but we will accept them. Mason, show this new recruit quarters to stow himself in, and see if you can find him something to eat, for he don't look over fed; and after the tramp which he has taken he must need refreshing." As Mason and Juniper were leaving, Butler called the latter back, and inquired if he had seen or heard anything of Brant and his men on his way through the country, sine he gave him the letters. Juniper replied in the ne^tfive. and Butler, mulsing for a moment, said:   REBELS   AND  TORIES.         167 ' That is strange, that you should not have heard of him. It seems impos- sible that we could have passed each other. At any rate, one of my runners must soon be in, and perhaps he may have news more agreeable for me. You may go." The two took their departure, and without noticing the others who stood near him, Butler continued in deep thought for several moments, when he was startled by a person rushing into his presence in almost breathless haste, ex- claiming as he did so- A large body of Indians are now close upon us, led by Brant. Their numbei must be at least five hundred warriors, and their intention probably is to encamp for the night near this place." "Fortune at last!" exclaimed Butler, clapping his. hands, and throwing a sovereign at the feet of the gratified messenger. "There is your reward- faith don't lose it in the dark. Brant at last! Well, this is indeed cheering news just at the moment when I began to despair." There was now plenty of bustle in the little camp; and preparations were hastily made to give the chieftain a welcome worthy of his rank. In the course of half an hour they heard the tramp of the advancing party, and in a little while after Theyendanega and Walter Butler stood face to face. The meeting was not by any means a cordial one, and particularly on the part of Brant did it seem most inopportune and unwelcome. There was a dignity in his countenance-a coldness in his manner anything but pleasing to Butler, and it irritated him to find himself in the presence of a being whom he feared as much as he disliked. But the Captain was not a person to sink his own interests in such feelings, and as repugnant as the associations of the moment might be to him, he was determined that it should be subordiniate to the great end in view-revenge for his imprisonment the preceeding winter. After informing Brant of the purpose of his expedition, the chieftain remarked to him, with great brevity, that his project would be likely to fail from the smallness of his detachment. "That may be," said Butler; "but I have hopes of a reinforcement strong enough to destroy two Cherry Valleys," "Where are they?" asked the chieftain. ' I see them not here-I heard not of them in the villages-I met them not in the forest." "They are nearer, though, than you think-not a bow-shot hence at the present moment." "The eyes of my young men are good-their ears are not shut. If they be where you say show them to me, or I shall think you play with your words." Calling for a torch, Butler drew from a pocket his commission, and asking Brant to read it, he exclaimed: "These are my reinforcements-you are their leader. Am I not strong enough now for the invasion of Cherry Valley?" Mortified beyond expression was the chieftain, as he read the commission of Butler, and returning it to his hands, he said: "Well, Captain Butler, I congratulate you on your succee in this matter. But suppose that I refuse to lend you the assistance of my warriors? You have no power to compel me."  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7034-00000085"/> 168         REBELS AND    TORIES, But I am confident that you will not refuse me. This business will be as much for youi advancement as my own; and you have wrongs to redress as well as myself." "But my young men have been on the war path all the summer, and they now want to return to Niagara. It is hot just either that I, a chief of the Mohawks, should be a second chief to young Walter Butler. I don't think I will go." l"Then the expedition will fall through, and Brant will receive censure that he took not advantage of an opportunity to strike a severe blow against the enemies of his race." "Let me be censured! Am I not a great chief? Do I not lead my own warriors to battle? Will they follow a pale face boy? Who censures Thay- endenega? They will not dare quarrel with him!"' "But you mistake me," said Butler, alarmed lest the anger of Brant  should carry him to such lengths as to cause him to refuse to join the expedi- tion. "You will see that I have done this for your advantage as well as my own. You have no reason to love the people of Cherry Valley more than myself; and the delay in getting into your winter quarters will not be more than a month, for which your warriors may be recompensed by many scalps." After some further parleying the difficulty between them was adjusted, and the sachem consented that on the following morning he would turn back with .his warriors, and joining his forces to those of Butler, carry havoc and destruction into the white settlements. Their combined forces now amounted to about seven hundred men. The first point of attack selected was Cherry Valley. CHAPTER XXIX.' THE CAMP AND THE HAMLET. CHERRY VALLEY was a settlement remarkable for its beauty and the fer- tility of its soil. Its inhabitants were noted for their intelligence and the scrupulousness of their morals. It was first settled in 1740, deriving its name from its abundant growth of wild cherry. It was situated about fifty-two miles west of Albany, and fifteen south from the Mohawk river. At the breaking out of the war the place possessed no fortification. Early in the spring of 77, General Lafayette directed a fort to be erected, the command of which was solicited by Colonel Gansevoort, with the regiment that distin- guished itself the pr ceding year in the defence of Fort Schuyler. The com- muad, however, from some cause or other, was given to Col. Alden, at the head of an eastern regiment. There was no disturbance in the valley, beyond the incident alarms, until the 8th of November. 1778, when the colonel received a dispatch from Fort Schuyler, informing him that his post was to be attacked by a party of Tories and Indians. Not crediting the rmnor. the colonel assured the people that he would take all the necessary steps to guard against surprise; and accordingly,   REBELS AND    TORIES.           169 on the following day he sent out scouts, and these, proceeding down the Sus- quehanna, in the evqing kindled a fire, by which they laid down to sleep, and only awoke to find themselves prisoners in the hands of Butler and Brant. On the following morning, compelling these men to act as guides, Butler with his Rangers and Brant with his savages, moved forward, and again encamped for the night on the top of a hill thickly covered with evergreens, and not more than a mile or a mile and a half from the village of Cherry Valley. Dur- ing the night the snow fell several inches, which in the morning turned to rain, with the atmosphere thick and cloudy. The village reposed in imagined security, from the assurances of Col. Alden that danger was too remote to be apprehended. The officers being accustomed to lounge among the families near the fort, were absent from their posts-the colonel himself, with his lieu- tenant, Statia, lodging at the residence of a Mr. Robert Wells, a judge of the county, and a gentleman of high respectability. You could scarcely say that the morn dawned on the 11th of November, 1778, so gloomy and dark was the atmosphere-so shrouded was everything around by cloud and mist; nor did the unconscious inhabitants dream that a bolt of vengeance hung so near above their heads. An hour before the time agreed upon between Butler and Brant for a de- scent upon the unsuspecting village, the former stood face to face with a man who had on the preceding evening presented himself as a volunteer in the for- tunes of the coming struggle. "Well, Nahum Leffers," said Butler somewhat contemptuously,  let us know each other. I have no objection to your taking part with us to-day. But I would have yo u know that your actions of late have been such as to give us good reason to suspect you." "I have been belied, then, Captain," said Leffers, in an humble tone. i Where were you last?" asked Butler. "With the Onondagas," he replied. ( On what errand among them?" again inquired Butler. "As a prisoner," said Leffers, " bound and sentenced." "For what new outrage did the Onondagas serve you thus?" said Butler, half sneeringly. "For an old grudge Wasshemett has borne me for several years.  "What! still the old story of thd Young Fawn. I can scarcely think it posssible." "( Upon my honor--" "Upon your honor!" exclaimed Butler, jeeringly. "Say nothing of that here, if you please. We all know the value of it too much to treat it lightly. Have you seen Brant?" "Yes, but ten minutes since," answered Leffers. "And he has promised that I shall be safe from further persecution." "How did you escape from the Onondagas7" inquired Butler, with in- terest. "By a mystery which I cannot explain," replied LefFers; " for I was  !ound to the stake, the faggots ready, fnd the fame about to be kindled." "Well. you are a lucky dog; but go, go. T have got ls much a I cal  f                       b        'e  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7034-00000086"/> 170         RZBzLS AND    TORsEd. think of at present, so leave me, and place yourself in condition for the day's work.  Turning from Leffers, Butler went to seek for Brant to make some plans for the attack, while the former sought for companionship among those with whom he could have more sympathy and with whom he stood more in the light of a superior. But as he passed along, he was followed by a pair of eyes, as gleaming and as ferocious as a tiger's, and by a step as stealthy as a cat's, that kept close upon him through the Indian camp, nor scarcely for- sook him when the order was given to march, though he saw not the form- though he heard not the footstep. At the same time, in a rude house, not the most conspicuous of the village, was seated a small party at family devotions. It consisted of an elderly gentleman, his wife, and a young woman about eighteen, of a most sweet countenance and gentle demeanor. There was a fourth in the party-a young man about the age of five-and-twenty, of a right manful and honest countenance, and of a build that indicated a frame of uncommon strength, and a manner that indicated frequent companionship with danger. As he sat a little behind the young lady, the elbow of his right arm rested on the back of her chair, and his eyes seemed to drink in with delight the petite and charm- ing figure before him. The old gentleman had been reading passages from Scripture, and as he closed the book which lay open on the table, he removed his spectacles from his eyes, and as they fell upon the youthful pair before him, a deep sigh escaped from him that caused his good lady to say: ' Now, my   dear, what can be the matter with you? I am sure I have heard you heave more than twenty mortal sighs since we sat down here, and I am certain there must be something extraordinary on your mind, or you would not look so seriously, nor sigh so dreadfully. What can be the mat- terl; Mr. M.?' At this speech from the good lady, both of the young people looked invol- nntArily at the old gentleman, to see if they could discover the cause of his unhappiness; their eyes met each other, and for a moment there was just a perceptible color in the cheeks of the young lady. But the old gentleman had lived long enough to think that it was not al- ways best to tell his thoughts; so, without uttering a fib, which he would not have done for the price of a crown, he answered: "Is it so very extraordinary for me to sigh? Have I not lived long enough to sigh over the sins of the people? and if not for that, may I not sigh when I think the time is fast approaching- when my earthly labors shall cease, and I   shall be deprived the pleasure-at least in this world-of giving consolation and advice to the mourner and the transgressor? As firmly as ollr anchor may be cast in the glories and rewards of another world, it is not in human nature to think of parting from the present, without sighing to the memor of past days, and the memory of departed friends?" "' God forbid, my dear sir, that you should not live many days to the grati- flcation of your friends!" exclaimed the young man earnestly. t   Ah, turphy! these ae evil times, I fear, that have flen upon us; and the stedfast in faith, and the true in heart, need all the oonsolatioas of a   R E B E L S A ND To R I S.          7 blessed redemption to uphold them in the Red Sea passage of our country's hopes!"       j "And she will come out at last free and disenthralled, while the waters of infamy shall roll over the hosts of our enemy, and cover him with perpetual shame. No, -few as we are in numbers, poor as we are in resources, rude as we are in discipline, and betrayed as we oft times are by wretches whom wer have been taught to consider as brothers, as long as George Washington leads in the field, Adaums and Hancock advise in our councils, and God does not for- sake us, we shall escape unscathed from the fiery ordeal. You and I may not live to see it-we, withl thousands of brave and trusty hearts may perish as victims on the altar of American liberty, but as sure as Omnipotence is just, the day of glory will dawn, and the oppressor shall be driven from our soil!" "I believe you, 'Murphy.  And if it is necessary that we should be victims, let 'us at least meet our fate with a manfulness that shall not sh1ame the cause. But the alarm caused in the village by the report that the enemy contem- plated a descent. seems to have subsided, and the indifference of the officers at the fort warrants us in supposing that there is no immediate danger." '* That indifference, reverend sir, is what troubles me more than the reports. Colonel Alden is doubtless a brave officer; but so little is he acquainted with the mode of Indian warfare, that f fear lafayette has made a mistake, in ap- pointing him to this post instead of Colonel Gansevoort." "I saw the colonel last evening," said the elder of the two, and he seemed confident that we halid no reason to fear." "But I have more reason to know thanll:l Alden,"' said Murphy. "' Ito merely chooses to discredit these reports, while TI having been recently through tho Indian country, am a better judge of uwhat I consider indications of hostility. You certainly must be aware that Walter Butler, now at large, has sworn revenge for his imprisonment; and the failure of Brant in his attempt upon this settlement, in May, last year, hlas not been forgotten by that c)iieftain; and you may be sure that he will avail himself of the first opportunity to re- trieve his want of success upon that occasion." :"But if those things are to happen, what can be done to arrest them?" asked the eldest of the two ladies. "If you really think we have cause to apprehend the danger which you speak of, may we not saverourselves by flight?" "No, my dear," said the old gentleman.  "We have come into this place as servants of God, and we should poorly perform his service if, on the first note of danger, we should forsake our post. In firm reliance upon his protection, we must stay and abide the consequences." ': Allow me," said Murphy, " to remark, that the first duty due to human nature is self-preserva:tion; and in our neglect of this we may sometimes in- volve in our own ruin the safety or happiness of those whom Providence has placed under our protection." "You may be right in that respect," said the other. "' And therefore, Mur- phy, confident in your judgment, and trusting in your honor, if you think we are in imminent danger, I will put Mrs. M. snd Arline under your protection, to he placed in security till the hour of danger is past."  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7034-00000087"/> 172         REBELS AND TORIES. :' I will never submit to such terms," said Mrs. }I. nervously. "Danger or not, where you abide there will I be with you." "Think not of me," said Arline, her blue eyes sparking with true feeling. "In this dilemma consider my wishes subordinate to your own." "Then I see no alternative," said Mr. M., 1" but to abide the result, for I will not consent to forsake my mission on the first threat of danger." "We will stay with you then," said both the ladies in the same breath. Murphy got impatient. He saw at once that there was no use in arguing with the old gentleman, who had no idea of swerving from what he considered the true sense of his duty. His good lady, though her nerves*were none of the strongest, at once resigned herself to her destiny; and Arline, though her heart fluttered at the first mention of danger, grew quite strong-hearted and courageous the moment that all idea of escape was given up. Murphy thought of one more attempt to argue the clergyman into his views, as he said: "Let me suggest that we all make a month's visit to Fort Schuyler, where you will be cordially welcomed. By that time the anticipated danger will be over. That place is strongly fortified in case of attack, and is under the com- mand of an experienced and gallant officer. By this means you will be able to extend your usefulness in a quarter where it will not fail to have a salu- tary effect." "Your arguments all fail," said Mr. M., with stoical composure. "Take the ladies with you, if you please, and they choose to go. I shall be glad to place them in safety; but as for myself, you may spare all entreaty, for I am determined not to forsake my little flock, though the wolf stand howling at the fold."         *               I "Stubborn man!" exclaimed Murphy, " will nothing convince you?" , "Nothing-but commands from heaven." "Thqse warnings are such commands," said Murphy. "Fly, ere it be too late, and repentance even cannot save you." The ladies again grew nervous. The anxiety of Murphy seemed to con- vince them of some extreme peril which threatened, and again joining their supplications to his, they urged upon Mr. Monroe instant flight. i' For the sake of this dear child here. whose protector you have assumed to be." said Mrs. Monroe. "For the sake of this good I\, whose love you have trusted'and shared for so many years!" iaid Arline,.lacing her tiny hands upon his arm. The clergyman raised his hands to his eyes, from which he brushed away a tear; his lips for a moment grew tremulous with emotion, and Murphy thought he had been gained. But the struggle was short; for, rising from his seat, he embraced his wife and Arline, and uttering a brief prayer for sup- port in this trying hour, lie placed their hands together, and pushing them toward Murphy, he exclaimed, as he fell back into his seat, "There, go, go! God bless and protect you! As for myself, I shall stay here to live or perish, as it may seem to my Master best." All further argument was useless. At this moleunt they were startled by the report of a gun in a distant part   REBELS AND    TORIES.          173 of the village, and in an instant after, the Wild Medicine rushed into the apartment, with wildness in his manners and fury in his eyes, exclaiming as he entered-    ! "The fiends are loose to-day! Up and away! Up and away! Red devils and- pale devils, and demons of blood have come out of the earth! have come down from the clouds!" "Too late! too late!" exclaimed Murphy in despair as he cast a glance at Arline. "God's will be done!" exclaimed the clergyman, clasping his hands. "Preserve my husband if you are a Christian!" said Mrs. Monroe, catching hold of the arm of W*ld Medicine. "Christian, I am ,none!" he exclaimed. "There is no blood of that sort in me. Don't call upon me to save! Fly! run! for the fiends will pur- sue! The air is foul and the waters murk! Think you the sun would shine on such a day 7" "Murphy," said Mr. Monroe, " your predictions are true. What shall we do? Is this man to be depended on? What do you advise 7" "As ever-flight!-at least attempt it, though our chances are doubtful." "Will, you try to save Arline? If she is harmed what despair is mine!" And Mr. Monroe clasped hisihands in an agony of suspense. "I will protect her with my life!" exclaimed Murphy. ' Immediate flight is our only hope. Co Me!"  "And saying this, Murphy took the hand of Arline, in his confusion, so great was his anxiety for her safety. Dropping it instantly, he said: "Procure yourselves, as quickly as possible, the necessary clothing to protect you from the weather. Wild Medicine, see to the old gentleman-he is paralyzed with this sudden alarm. Ladies, for heaven's sake, be quick!" For a few moments all was bustle. Things were turned upside down-- the old gentleman and his wife taking up one thing and throwing it down to seize another; nor would they have gotten away for an hour, had not Mur- phy interposed by showing them that they could not really carry away any- thing but the clothes on their backs. This was a disappointment to Mr. Monroe, as he had many favorite books which it grieved him to leave to de- struction; none, however, could he carry except his Bible, and this he hugged with a miser's care. Mrs. M. had this nick-nack and that that she dreaded parting with; but as time was precious, not an instant could be spared to pack or select. In a few momentsthey were ready to depart, and Murphy, giving his arm to Arline, they were hurrying from the house, folloiwed by the clergyman and his wife, when the young rifleman was seized by the Wild Medicine, who whispe :ed in his ear: "Fool! would you lead that poor girl to death 7 Leave her to my care, while you endeavor to save the others." "And why? Is not my arm as stout as yours?" said Murphy impa- tiently. "I doubt that, even," said the Wild Mnedicine. "But under your escort she will be a mark for every red devil's bullet. I am more used to their cus- toms-more familiar with their habits, than yourself.

This; girl shall be my prisoner, and as I mingle among them, or pass through them, they will not molest her." ' Your argument is reasonable enough," replied Murphy; and turning to 'Arlne, he said:-"I think you' will be safer in the protection of the Wild Medicine than with me, if you are willing to trust yourself with him. What do you say?" "iAnd why not extend that protection to Mr. and Mrs. Monroe 7" inquired Arline.                 1 "iAs far as- practicable, certainly. But I shall myself see to their safety. You have seen a spice of his valor ere now, enotgh to warrant you in believing him as capable of serving you in this emergency as myself." Arline had sufficient good sense not to dispu-e the arrangement, though her own heart, no doubt, would have preferred Murphy for a protector. Taking, therefore, the hand of the Wild Medicine, they rushed out of the house, fol- lowed by Murphy, the clergyman and his wife. They took their way across the road, over into an adjoining field, and thence to a piece of wood about a half-mile distant; and owing to the haziness of the atmosphere, they were enabled to get a considerable distance from the house ere the dreadful war- hoop broke upon their ears in such terrific 'ones that their blood thrilled with horror as they thought of the awful carnage of which it was the pre- cursor. The charge of the Indians was terrific. Led by the Senecas, the most ferocious of the Six Nations; it seemed more like the rush of maddened beasts of prey than of human beings. The Rangers, led by Butler, paused at the entrance of the village to examine their powder, which, owing to the rain, had become wet, and this delay gave the Indians an opportunity of first entering. To this accident some writers have attributed a good portion of that day's attrocities, as it was believed by many, at the time, that had Butler been present at the first assault, so much barbarity and cruelty would not have occurred. Before he left camp: however, Butler detached about twenty of his Rangers to make a circuitous route, and gain the opposite side of the village, to inter- cept such of the inhabitants as attempted flight by that quarter. Among this party was Juniper, eager to fight his maiden battle. It was not an expedition the most easily accomplished; for, owing to the bad state of the weather, the roads, whenever they followed them, were almost . impassable, and when they attempted to cross fields they did not meet with better success, sometimes having to wade through swampy grounds, and at other times to pass through almost impenetrable thickets. But the little party pushed on with a manfulness worthy of a better cause, and by the time that hostilities commenced, they were in a position to overlook the village, and arrest such of the inhabitants as should seek flight in that direction. -But there was an- other motive that governed the actions of Juniper, other than a desire for his first battle; and this was the hope of once more obtaining possession of Ar- line, for which purpose. solely, had he been induced to offer himself as a volunteer,.upon learning the determination of Butler and Brant to make a 06-   REBELS AND    TORIES.           175 scent upon Cherry Valley. lIe was about to enter the village to search for her, when his attention was arrested by a party of five persons whom he discerned walking rapidly through the fields to the left of where he stood, and in a direction from the settlement. From  the view which he obtained of them through the thin veil of mist which still hung around, he was enabled to make out that two of them were females, and a third an elderly gentleman who seemed to progress nwith grfat difficulty. Suspecting at once that she whom he sought was one of the party, he pointed them out to the Rangers, and in- 'stantly started in pursuit. CHAPTER XXX. THE MASSACRE.   * THE farst token which the unsuspecting inhabitants received of the enemy's approach, was the report of a single gun. As the Indians neared the outskirt s of the village, a man on horseback, who was proceeding thither, was fired upon and slightly wounded. Perceiving the foe, he dashed forward on his horse, and though repeatedly fired after, he succeeded in reaching the village in safety, and hurried immediately to the garrison to give the alarm. Here he was told that the Colonel was at the -house of Mr. Wells. Speeding thither as fast as possible, he entered the house, and found Alden in conversation with his host. With an apology for his abrupt intrusion, lhe at once related his adventure, adding that the Indians would be in the village in less than half an hour. The iamily of Mr. Wells were greatly alarmed, and he himself advised that immediate steps should be taken to repel the enemy, and place the fami- lies as soon as possible within the protection of the fort. But the Colonel was still incredulous. From reasons most unaccountable he refused to believe that the enemy were approaching in force. He seemed to persist in an idea that the wounded man was more alarmed in imagination than by the reality of any positive danger. Iie considered it next to impossible, and by no means probable, that a force of Indians could be so near them without being made aware of it by the vigilance of his scouts; and it was only by the entreaties of Mr. Wells, to which were joined those of his family, that he consented at least that the guards should be called in. They were dispersed in different directions about the village, and some time must elapse before they could present themselves at the garrison. Orders were dispatched, however, some by the person who had brought the intelligence, and others by different mem- bers of Mr. Wells's family. This done, they began now to think of escaping to the fort but this little thing and that had to be seen to, which delayed them for some time; and then, as usual, the confusion that always attends haste impeded the progress of preparation, till at last the absolute horror of their situation was revealed to them by the war-shouts, and the presence of savage warriors around the house. Outside the assumlt commenoed with most deter-  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7034-00000089"/> 176         REBELS "AND TORIES. mined fury-inside everything was brought into requisition that could be used to barricade doors and windows. The former were bolted and barred- the shutters of the latter were closed. Chairs, tables, and even bedsteads were piled up, and still the assault went on with increased fury to a chorus of yells-- "Infernal noise! war seemed a civil game To this uproar; horrid confusion heap'd Upon confusion rose." The family of Mr. Wells consisted of nine persons-himself, his wife, his brother and a sister, three sons and a daughter. The guards stationed at the house by Colonel Alden, were either killed or taken prisoners. This was the first bloody act of the tragedy, and was witnessed from one of the windows by the inmates. At length the door began to give way. All hope of escape or resistance vanished, and in the last resource of despair, Mr. Wells called his family to prayer, a id knelt down in their midst. There was an aged mother and fond wife, with clasped hands, and tearful eyes appealing for Heaven's mercy! Kneeling by the side of her parent, whose arms clasped her warmly to her heart, Was the beautiful and accomplished Jane, the sister of Mr. Wells. Trembling like a frightened dove, her pale lips moving with inaudible supplication, the moisture of agony upon her brow, and the cheek, so lately blooming withk the-'rose, wan with fear,-"Niobe all tears" looked not so lovely. By her side, with folded arms, looking sternly resolved to meet with manliness the dreadful fate that seemed so certain, stood her brother John. There was no pallor in his face, which, if anything, was more than usually flushed. The mouth was firmly shut, and the lips compressed, though slightly expressive of scorn. The head'was thrown back more defyingly than was his custom, and the nostril seemed to dilate with an ambition to do, if to do were possible. The heart only made its emotion visible by its throbbing, and perhaps the eye gleamed a little ferociously. Mrs. Wells knelt by the side of her husband,with one arm thrown over the shoulder of her daughter, who was weeping immoderately, but she herself as calm as a summer's twi- light. The three boys were grouped closely around their father, nervously agitated, but indicating few other symptoms of alarm. In another corner of the room, seemingly but little interested in the situation of those about him, stood Colonel Alden. He was arming himself with pistols, and paying most particular attention to the situation of a window in the rear of the house, as though calculating the chances of an escape thence. The voice of prayer continued to ascend within from the calm and manly voice of Mr. Wells, and without the yells of the besiegers grew louder and louder, while stone and tomahawk thundered against the doors and windows. And human nature would be spared a reproach if none other than the voices of savages had helped to raise the awful din of battle that made the hearts of the beseiged ache with terror. At length the door began to yield; the cries were redoubled. One more effort, inhuman savage and still more inhuman Tory. There-there-'tis done! it cracks!--it splits-the breach is made, and with maniac wildness, in rush the maddened crew.    . At that instant-at that very moment that the savages entered-Col. Alden   REBELS AND T ORIES.            1" escaped through the window in the rear-not undiscovered, however. Making away from the scene of carnage as fast as he could, down a hill, he was pursued by an Indian, who hallood to him to surrender. To this the colonel paid no attention; but, finding that his pursuer gained upon him, he turned round, and drawing one of his pistols, attemped to discharge it, but without effect. Again the flight continued, and again did lie turn and snap his pistol, but with the same result. Desperate with such fortune, he flung the useless weapon to- ward the savage, and once more urged his flight, still pursued, and each stride of his enemy lessening the distance between them. Now the struggle is des- perate. If the colonel can only gain yonder copse, he may be saved. So thinks his pursuer; but they are now only a few yards apart, and the savage suddenly pauses. The tomahawk is flourished above his head, and hurling it forward with unerring precision, it goes like a gleam of light through the air, and crushes through the shoulder of its victim. A shriek of agony follows I ?' -a scream of fiendish triumph peals through the echoes of hill and forest, and darting forward, the foot of the Indian is upon the neck of his prostrate victim, as he writhes in the awful pangs of death! Drawing his scalping knife, he stooped down to wind his fingers in the hair of A!den, and as he did so, he said: "Peltasharoo is a great brave! Wasshemett shall no more taunt him with cowardice-the old chiefs of our nation shall no longer call him a fool-the, squaws shall never again call him a boy. A scalp shall hang at his war-belt. He has slain a big chief. Peltasharoo may now join the council of the braves. Star-flower shall smile upon him; and her eyes, brighter than the meteor's track, shall look no more disdain upon the young chief of the Onondagas!" The next moment the scalp was hanging at the belt of Peltasharoo; but as the bloody trophy was torn from the head of the victim, the colonel, with the last struggle of death, raised himself upon his elbow, and thus addressed his foe  "Dog of an Indian! To your hand alone owe I my death. But your tri- umph shall be short' Though my scalp hangs now at your side; though I have been cloven to the earth by your tomahawk, yet I defy you still! Curses upon you and the master whom you serve! But I will not die unavenged! No! for nothing can you do to me-though your invention be racked for modes of torture, I'defy you still!-and thus-thus!" Saying this, he drew his remaing pistol, and ere the wary eye of Peltasharoo, could arrest the movement, he discharged it at his head. Almost blinded by the powder itself, so near were they together, with one bound he sprang from earth, and with outstretched hands he tried to reach the colonel, helpless, and, by this time, almost insensible. The attempt was not in vain, bfr staggering toward the body, he fell upon it, and clasping it in the last struggles of deith, thus died they together-locked heart to heart-the hand of the Indian clutch- ing the throat of the white man, while the teeth of the latter were fixed vice- like in the arm of his foe. And thus died they together-the Indian and the pale face; and the angel that keeps the record of heaven's high courts, would fain have dropped a tearto the oblivion of the deed. But in vain! Hatred and revenge were locked in terrible embrace; and the evil spirits of the air 12  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7034-00000090"/> 178         REBELS  AND  TORIES. revelled over the bloody act, as the souls of the departed entered the precincts of their gloomy domain. Thus, justly, perhaps, fell Colonel Ichabod Alden, a victim to his own ignorance of the duties that belonged to the position in which he had been placed. In the meantime, the savages crowded into the house of Mr. Wells, and tle first victim that fell before the eyes of the family was the aged matron. Cloven through to the chin was her skull; and so skilftl and exact had been the blow, that she expired without a struggle! In spite of the shrieks for mercy-in defiance of the weak and uselss defence attempted by Mr. Wells and his brother John-one after another fell beneath the tomahawks of the foe. In vain the wife pleaded for mercy! While she clasped her daughter to her breast, their scalps were torn reeking from their living bodies, and they were left to be dispatched by others, whose rage had no vent except through the wounds by which their lives escaped. The next victim was Mr. Wells him- self-then three boys; but the brother manfully stood up and fought with a , tiger's desperation for his life!-not so much for his life either, as in revenge for the blood of his kindred, that made the floor upon which he stood so gory. With one hand seizing the arm of his sister, in the other he held an axe with which he kept the foe at bay, while he retreated backward toward the window through which Colonel Alden had escaped. Fearfully did he deal his blows, as more than one bleeding victim bore witness to; and no muscle faltered- none of the pallor of fear blanched his cheeks. To the right and to the left dealt he his blows, with the coolness of a veteran, till reaching the sought-for window, he pushed his sister toward it, while he guarded the passage to it, flourishing his weapon with terrible defiance. Ha! she has escaped!-she is free!--and the brother, assured of this, rashes forward among the foe, deter- mined on one desperate effort of revenge! One, two, three! fall before the awful stroke of his arm, till mad with frenzy, the whole body of savages uttering the most demoniac yells, rush at once upon him; and thus fell the stout man-the courageous heart-struck down with twenty weapons!- hacked and gashed till form and feature remained not to show the victim had once been human! The floor was covered with the dead of both parties; but there was none now left to dispute the cruelty of the red man, so he shouts his war-cry of victory, makes sure that he has every scalp, fires the house, and rushes forth in pursuit of fresh victims! Outside, the battle raged with equal fury. Family after family were de- stroyed by the merciless foe-the savages, headed by the great chief of the Senecas-the Tories, by the incarnate Leffers. Hearths were made desolate, and fire completed the work of havoc. In the meantime, the forces under Brant assaulted the fort; but it was de- fended with manfulness by the soldiers and such of the inhabitants as had succeeded in reaching it. So well was the assault repelled with grape and musketry, that the Indians, not partial to such methods of warfare, were glad to withdraw to scenes where they could act with less danger to themselves and with greater destruction to the inhabitants. Neither was Butler, with his Rangers, inactive-leading them hither and thither. destroying or capturing both old and young, without regard to sex,   REBELS AND    TORIES.      o    179 if possible as infuriate as the Indians. The Mohawk chief seemed possessed of omnipresence-visiting different parts of the village almost in the same breath-at times accompanied by his fierce band of warriors-at times alone- in one instance entering a house, the sole inmates of which were a mother and her children. ; Woman," said he, "why are you thus unconcerned while your neighbors are being killed around you?" "We are friends to the crown," replied the woman. "What reason have 1 for alarm-who will harm me?" "Friends or foes are not recognised here," said Brant. "Friends of my own have fallen whom my life should have defended. The same fate may be yours." Alarmed at this declaration of the Mohawk, the woman clasped her hands in terror, apparently first conceiving the imminent peril of her situation. "Alas!" said she, "What shall I do? Oh! if Brant were here, I know I should not be harimed." "I am Brant, myself, but have no power over these forces. I am not in command to-day." "What shall I do-what shall I do!" exclaimed the woman, almost par- alyzed with fear. "I cannot save you-impossible!" replied the chief. "In one moment more the Senecas, or the Tories, over whom I have no control, will be here. You must escape." "But my children!" exclaimed she, despairingly; " what shall I do with them 7" "Go, quick! words are useless-time important," replied Brant, impa- tiently. "But you can save me, Joseph Brant-you must? Do not say it is im- possible. Who dare dispute you?" "-To bed, then," said he, hurriedly; "feign yourself sick; I will try my best." The tramp of the Indians could already be heard. Pealing their war-cry, onward they came; and the poor woman had no alternative but to obey the suggestion of the warrior. Springing into bed as quiclly as possible, she had barely time to pull the clothes over her head before the room was filled with savages. They were the chieftain's own Mohawks! Turning to them, he directed them to paint his mark upon the woman and her children. This done, he said to her: ; Have no fear, now; you are probably safe; for none dare do violence to the mark of Theyendanega, from Seneca to Onondaga; from Onondaga to Butler."* E "Each of the Five Nations was divided into three tribes, bearing respectively for their ensigns, and distinguished by the names of, the Tortoise, the Boar, and the Wolf."- Moore's Indian Vars.

Turning to his warriors, he addressed to them a few brief sentences, when they departed, leaving the affrighted woman in comparative safety. But to return to Jane Wells, who had fled from the massacre of her fa- mily through a rear window of the house. No sooner were her feet upon the ground, than, aware of the dreadful fate of all those whom she held dear, and convinced that her own life depended upon some hasty method of concealment, she fled to a pile of wood in the im- mediate vicinity of the house, where she endeavored to hide herself from the argus-eyed foe. How her poor heart beat with the trepidation of fear! how her eyes wept burning tears for the fate of those left behind! how she trem- bled like the frightened doe driven at bay-not so much in fear of her own imminenz peril as in the presence conjured before her vision of the mangled forms of those she loved. Close as tightly as she could her eyes-nay, blind them with her tiny hands, she saw the tomahawk of the savage crush through the brain of her aged mother-she saw the slaughter of her brother's wife and her children! She heard again the voice of that brother ascend in prayer as the bloody weapon was raised above him! The defence of John was acted over again I She could see the gleaming of his fierce eye-the quailing of the savage crew before him, as step by step he defended his retreat to the window through which she had escaped! Impossible these sights to banish! impos- sible not to hear the shrieks of the victims for mercy! impossible not to hear the terrific cries of exultation and rage that escaped from the Indians, and in her terror she uttered a cry of despair, forgetting the peril of her situation. Fatal cry! Wasshemett was a great brave! A dozen scalps hung at his belt as the re- sult of his action in that scene of carnage. How his squaws shall rejoice when henreturns to his village, and with savage pomp exhibits to them the goodly array of trophies, reeking from the pole upon which he will hang them! How the young men of the village, who have not yet trodden in the war-path, will envy the great chief, and make sacrifices that they majr be equally successful in their turn? How will the women array themselves in their gaudiest colors, as they join the young men in their dances round the red post, and in concert with the warriors, sing the war-song and the scalp-song! Unsated, the chief of the Onondagas was yet seeking for more victims, when his ears were assailed by wails and sobs of distress. It was the voice of ao fe- male, and the glossy locks of the scalp would make choice fringing for the leggings of the war-chief! In every direction turned he his eagle eye, yet he detected not the presence of the pale-faced squaw. Yes! he sees her now!- approaching a pile of wood, the skirt of a frock, and the delicate slippered feet were discovered. With the bound of a tiger, and the fierce outcry of a madman, he leaped forward, and dragging from her shelter the timorous crea- ture, none other stood before him than the fugitive, Jane Wells! What avails it to cry for mercy before such a merciless captor 7 His ears are deaf to such appeals-his heart is insensible to emotions of pity-adamant as it is!

"' The blood of the Mohawk is very hot on the long knives of the pale faces. The kindred of Wasshemett fill many resting-places. The spirits of warriors departed sing in the cars of our braves, and they are not happy in their broad hunting grounds, while those who break the sod over their graves go un- punished." '"But I have done you no harm," said the maiden. "' I have given fbod anid shelter to the weary bunter, and blankets to his squaws and papooses." "It is good," said Wasshemett. "The white maiden is very fair, and her voice is sweeter than the notes of the early birds of the spring. But Wasshe- mett has many times listened to such songs, and many times has the singer raised the war-cry in his own lodge, and sent out the hunters on the trail of the red man. Will the white maiden speak?" "You have slain all my kindred! Iad they not blood enough for the thirsty throats of your warriors?" "' One of your kin, a great brave, has slain three of the best warriors of Wasshemett. The blood of the Seneca also smokes upon the hatchet of your brother i He was a great brave, but his scalp is in my belt. And here is one with many winters' frost upon it." Pointing to his belt as he spoke, the fair girl looked and beheld a sight, at the hoiror of which she shrieked and fell insensible at the feet of the savage. -She had recognised the gory white locks of her mother, and the soft brown hair of her brother John. At this instant, a Tory passing was attracted by the loveliness of the maiden, and appealed in her behalf; but in vain. Wasshemett motioned him back disdainfully, exclaiming as he did so: "Will the snake of a pale face come under the red war-knife of the Onon- daga! Better that the maiden die unspotted by the hand of a great chief, than go into the lodge of the hungry wolf. The weapon of Wasshemett breeds no plague; the touch of the white warrior rots. From my hands she shall go pure to the Great Spirit. Michi-Manitou! to you I sacrifice this spotless fawn! Spirits of the braves who have fallen, rest in quiet." With these words, he seized the still insensible maiden by the hair, and in the next instant the hatchet of the chieftain was buried deep in her temple. Snatching the scalp from her head, he uttered a shrill cry of triumph, and bounded off to join his warriors. ,-----  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7034-00000092"/> 182         REBELS AND    TORIES. CHAPTER XXXI. i' HE FU G I r V E S.  WE left the good clergyman, his wife, and Arline in full flight under the guidance and protection of Murphy and the Wild Medicine. They had suc- ceeded at length in gaining the shelter of the woods before they thought of pausing. difficult and toilsome as was the flight to Mrs. Monroe. Seeking the protection of a thicket that afforded them a naturzl arbor, they halted to con- sider what steps next to take to avoid falling into the hands of the enemy. They were aware, as they entered the forest. that they were pursued; but though this might have been foreseen, still it tended considerably to heighten the alarm of the fugitive party. But the quick eye of the Wild Medicine was able to detect that their pursuers were not Indians. and consequently not so liable to discover them as the red man would be from his natural keenness upon a trail. Murphy, as he looked around, began to feel comfortable, as he noticed that they were surrounded by underbrush and briar almost imper- vious to the eye, except at the place where they had entered, and this. with a moment's work, they were enabled to arrange in such a manner as to pre- vent their being seen from without, or in any way to excite attention should the foe come near their immediate vicinity. Vaiwous were the suggestions now made respecting the next move. Mrs. Monroe was for pushing farther on into the forest; the clergyman thought it possible, that by trying, they might be able to reach Schenectady; Arline had nothing to suggest; but said that wiser heads than hers must plan and direct all their movements, whether they led them further from danger or in the face of their foes. "Well," said Murphy, "I have given no opinion as yet: but I want to know what the Wild Medicine here thinks; for he seems to have been brought up in the forest, and though I have had considerable experience of late, I am willing to grant, as respects these red devils, that he knows more about them, and about their ways, than I do-especially the Ingins in these parts." Billy was leaning on his rifle in deep thought, but as Murphy finished speak- ing, he turned slowly round, while all eyes were bent upon him to see what he might have to say. "When the moon is out and the owl hoots, the red man sleeps," said the Wild Medicine. "Where, blood flows and the scalp is found, the red man fights!" "You advise us to. stay where we are till night. You think the red man will not leave the foe before him, to seek us whom he has not seen?" said Murphy. "Yes, we must stay where we are," said he. "When it is dark we can move on again, and our trail cannot so easily be seen. Perhaps to-morrow we may return to the village; for the Indians, after their work is done. will not care to stay for the arrival of troops." "' You are right this time. as usualf' said Murphy. "We must bide our   REBELS AND    TOnIES.          183 tnme; and although the place will not be as comfortable as a moro human shelter, still we must endeavor to make the best of it." "I would not mind it so much," said Mrs. Monroe, " if we only had fire. I am almost perishing with cold." "'; Fire!" exclaimed the Wild Medicine. "l That would burn indeed, and would end with the burning of ourselves. We should be discovered by In- dianl as well as Tory, and we should have work enough on our hands to last our lifetime!" "My dear," said the clergyman to his wife, ;' if under this dispensation of Providence we encounter evils no worse than the want of fire. I fear we should be sinful to complain. We have been wonderfully preserved thus far, espe- cially when we consider how many f ouir der friends have already fallen the victims of a merciless foe!"  1 1  \ '* Well, my dear sir," said Murphy, ;on' must grumble a little at times, else we should not be human; and I don't think it worth while to belie our nature." / "Ah." said the clergyman, with a shake of the head; ' how little do you understand"--          l "Hush!" said the Wild Mcdicine, raising his landl; "' leave this argument for. another time. Some one approaches." All listened, and they could distinctly hear the tread of feet and the sound of voices. Murphy peered through the thicket and discovered a party of But- ler's Rangers approaching in the direction of their place of concealment. 'Turn- ing to the Wild Medicine, who was likewise reconnoitering, he said: "There is a dashing young chap at their head that I should like most hugely to present with one of my rifle bullets; but I suppose it would be of no use. What do you think about it?" "Keep quiet as possible. You stay here to protect the women; I will go out and meet them." Parting the brush as he -said this, the Wild Medicine sallied out, took a direction from the approaching party, unobserved by them, and turned and came back, managing to reach the Rangers a few rods before they reached the place where the fugitives lay concealed, yet seemingly as though by accident. Making a feint to pass, however, he was hailed by Juniper, who was foremost. "Well, madman! what do you here, prowling about the forest. Account for yourself before we give you dog's welcome!" "Blood! does it not flow! I would dabble in it. Have you secrets?- keep them! Trust them not to the air-confine ethem not in coffins-sink them not beneath the water; for the air will babble, coffins gape and speak, and the waters will give up I What seek ye?" "The party whom you conducted from the village a little while ago-an old man and his wife, and a fair girl," said Juniper. "What! you are at- that trade then!" he exclaimed. "Went the work merrily I It is so pleasant to hear the life blood bubbling out! there is but one sight to equal it." "What is that, driveller?" asked Juniper.  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7034-00000093"/> 184         REBELS  AND  TORIES. , "The glare of a drowning man's eye," he shouted; and he laughed till the forest echoes were startled from their retreats. "'Tis horrid to see, but it giveth glee- The glare in a drown'd man's eye! And the story shall tell so well in hell That the fiends shall revel high; For nothing giveth them sport so rare As a murderer's look of black despair! Would you ask me   I have not seen the sun to-day, nor will the moon shine to-night, but the deed was done! What want you with me?" The eye of Juniper quailed before the glance of the Wild Medicine; and though he would gladly have sent a ball through his heart where he stood, he was restrained by an awe which he could not understand. Determined, however, not to be baffled in his search, if it were possible to prevent it, he againi asked what had become of the party whom he saw him escorting off from the village. "When was I in the village?" asked the Wild Medicine. Need I trust myself within reach of Tory or Indian?" "Have you seen no one pass this way?" inquired Juniper. "Have I the eyes of a hawk? Can I tell the wolf which way the sheep will run No!" "Shoot the fool at once," said one of the Rangers, stepping forward, with his rifle at rest. "Will you do it?" he exclaimed, with a sneer. "No! your arm would shrivel first-your heart would wither first! What will a boy do? Practice your rifle first on innocent women and children!" Turning to one of the party-an older man than the rest-Juniper inquired of him if he thought it best that the pursuit be ended, or whether it would not be better to beat the bushes, and push forward for half a mile farther. "If you will take my advice," said the Ranger, "I should advise you to re- turn, and engage yourself in the duty for which you was detached. But let me ask you-is the game we hunt something pleasant for your own palate, or really is it of public importance?" "And why if it is for something pleasant to my own palate, as you say, then what is your suggestion?" "That you employ not Butler's Rangers in such beggarly service. I think I know your object-we shall not assist you further in your search." ' As you please," said Juniper, not a little mortified; but at least there is enough about this person to excite suspicion. Let us secure him, and take him back a prisoner." "What! the Wild Medicine! Why, he is known better in the camp of the Rangers-and even to their captain, too-than you would be by twelve months' service." "But he may be leaguing with the enemy," said Juniper. "Not a wit; he leagues with no one. He is off and n in both camps, but sides with neither," said the Ranger.   REBELS  AND TORIES.           18 "Then," said Juniper, "I suppose we must return without accomplishing anything. So, come quickly." The Rangers turned to depart, but ere Juniper had taken a step, the Wild Medicine approached and whispered in his ear: Ralph Upton, beware! An eye you wot not of is watching you. Your villainies shall not succeed. Beware! for the birds twitter of you. But you had better pray-pray to be forgiven that one dark crime."  ' Mysterious being! what do you mean?" exclaimed Juniper, with feigned astonishment. But he knew, for his own heart told him the meaning. "Shall I speak it?" "Wretch, never!" exclaimed Juniper, as he drew a short knife from the breast of his coat, and made a pass at the Wild Medicine, who, detecting the movement, caught his arm in time to save him from murder. No one saw the act; but the lips of Juniper were livid with baffled rage, as his arm was held in the powerful grasp of his opponent, who. looking him almost fiercely in the eyes, said to him in a voice free from passion: "This is the second time, Ralph, and you have escaped. Beware the third. But I will tell your fortune. Ere the new year come again, you shall see blood enough to make you drunk. It may be of your own shedding-it may be that of your own kindred! Now, go. Turn your steps toward the village. There you may find slaughter enough; for the infernal pit has disgorged all its fiends, and when they revel, there is high glee. Go!" Turning from him, the Wild Medicine walked off in -the direction from which he had approached when first discovered by Juniper, and the Rangers returned to the village. Juniper was beyond measure most miserable; for the strange being whom he had encountered, seemed more intimate with some of the actions of his life than was at all agreeable, and he determined to study some method of relieving himself from the fearful apprehensions that now must continually haunt him. What eye had seen it! he thought. How came the mystery into the light from the darkness in which he had thought it hidden? Was the secret only in the breast of that one being? If so, meas- ures must be taken that it leak not out; and no seal but that of death, could lock the mouth! And thus he pondered as he walked toward the village; and ere he pondered long his mind had resolved how to act. The Wild Medicine, when he left the Rangers, made a circuit through the woods, till, being satisfied that his party were now safe, he returned to his friends whom he found anxiously awaiting the result of the controversy with- out. Informing them of all that had taken place, he now proposed to Mur- phy that he should stay to protect the two females and the clergyman, while he himself went in quest of something to eat. It would not be safe for them to leave their place of concealment before the ensuing day, in consequence of which refreshment would be necessary; and though the confinement to Mur- phy was irksome in the extreme, he had the sense to see that the proposal of the Wild Medicine was the best that could be thought of, and more particu- larly as he was convinced that in the matter of procuring something to allay hunger, this strange being stood a better chance than himself of success. Na- turally an active man. the position in which he was placed weighed heavily  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7034-00000094"/> 186          REBELS AND    TORIES. upon his conscience but for the sake of those who were under his charge, he did not think it would be prudent to leave them alone for a moment until he saw them placed beyond the reach of peril. Leaving them thus to await his return, the Wild Medicine started in the direction of the village. Though the work of carnage was still progressing-- thoughtthe shrieks of the victims mingled in sad chorus with the shouts and yells of the demoniac invaders--though flames crackled and blood flowed in torrents, preserved by some supernatural agency, he quailed not before the scene of slaughter, but went forward to mingle in the desperate fray. The savage raised no war-cry for him-Tory nor Ranger heeded him; but on he passed, fearless and solemn, through groups and columns. At one place he saw a fugitive pursued and overtaken by a brother. Mercy was deaf, though thile same mother had nursed them-though the same arms had nestled them in infancy.  "Brother, for God's sake, spare me!" shrieked  the victim. "Die! infernal rebel!" said the other, as he shot him through the head, and the warm blood spurted upon his garments! The Wild Medicine passed on, for he recognised the monster, and he chaunted: "The blood of the murdered shall rise again To haunt and accuse each guilty Cain!" In another place he met a Tory with an infant; and as the little cherub smiled in his arms, the fiend incarnate, taking the child by the heels, dashed out its brains against a tree.*  But he passed on, though strong as he was in heart, hardened as he had been by fate's severest lessons, steeled as he was against all appeals of pity, he felt his blood throb wildly in his veins, and he could scarce restrain his hands from doing dreadful judgment. Anon-dabbled and spotted with gore, panting like a wild beast gorged with prey-he met Leffers. Raising his hands as the wretch attempted to pass, he accosted him: "Ho!  Nahum Leffers-ho! How goes the feast?  Have you drank blood enough to quench the fire within? "  "  Devil! are you thus before me?  When shall I cease to meet you?" ex- claimed Leffers. "Never! through all eternity we shall be twin spirits! I  have seen you strike a fair youth, and the breech of -your rifle is now crimson with the awful horror of the act!  I have seen that boy stand by his mother's chair as she combed his fair locks. I have seen him playing with the wild deer in the forest, and I have looked in upon his desolate home, when the father grieved for his lost child, and the mother's heart was breaking! I have met that fa- * Seres like these were not uncommon in the wars of that period. In Thatcher's Mil- itary Journal, in giving an account of Indian bbarbarities at the massacre of Wyoming, the author says: "One-Partial Terry, the son of a man of respectable character, having joined the Indian party, several times sent his father word that he hoped to wash his hands in his heart's blood. The monster with his own hands murdered his father, mo- ther, brothers, and sisters, stripped off their scalps, and cut off his father's head.

And the cabin of the white settler and the wigwam of the Indian was searched in vain-and the parent returned to his holme, and the boy was mourned as dead!" "And then!'gasped Lefters. "And then-" shouted the Wild Medicine, " and then, within a year after, when the father was mad with the slaughter of the innocent, a lioy knelt at his feet begging for mercy. But his eyes were blinded with the smoke of battle: his heart was cased in adamant, and the appeal of innocence beat un- heeded against it, and with one blow he smote him dead, and the accusing spirit flew to heaven!" As he uttered these last words, he pointed with triumph' to the bloody weapon in the hands of Leffers, and his wild laugh rang loud above the cries of victor and vanquished; and he passed on over the body of his old foe, as he lay writhing upon the earth in the agonies of despair! CHAPTER XXXII. NIGHT ANDI)  G1.OO  I. THE desolation was complete. Thle dwellings of the settlers were reduced to heaps of smouldering ruins. Barns, containing the fruits of the preceding harvest, were destroyed. Cattle were either slaughtered or driven off by the invaders, and many of the inhabitants, men, women, and children, who had escaped death by the tomahawk of the savage or the rifle of the Ranger, were carried away captive. Late in the day of the massacre, the eneminy, with their prisoners, left the scene of their atrocities, and encamped for the night about two miles south of the fort. Here, without protection from the elements, exposed, half-clothed, to the inclemency of the weather, with no shelter but the cheerless winter skies, and no bed but the frozen ground, were the unfortunate victims of this expedition compelled to pass the long and dreary night-to be spectators of the exulting revelry of the savage, and listen to the wild yells of delight ex - pressive of his joy at his success. After performing their customary origics- their dances, their songs of triumph, &amp;c., the Indians, about midnight, made a division of their spoil. This occupied theim till morning, when they re- sumed their march. going down the Susquehanna to the Tioga, thence up the Seneca to Niagara. In the meantime the little party whom we left in the forest under the pro- tection of Murphy, were suffering all the anxieties of uncertainty. It was midnight, and the Wild Medicine had not returned, and they began to enter- tain fears for his safety. They were suffering much firom the cold, and the faithful rifleman dare not light a fire for fear of being discovcred by the enemy. and it required all the eloquence and artlgumnt that lie \:is m:aster of to keep  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7034-00000095"/> 188         REBELS AND TORIES. up the spirits of Mrs. Monroe and the good clergyman. Arline, alone, seemed to keep her patiench, and at times found words of comfort and hope for the rest. She was suffering little from the cold, as fortunately, on her escaping from the house, she had taken the precaution to throw over her shoulders a heavy cloak and shawl; though the latter article she had insisted upon wrap- ping around her friend, who, as she herself declared, was " dreadfully perished," and she really believed she should " be frozen stiff dead long before morning." "Now, my dear," said Mr. Monroe to his wife, " how can you be so un- reasonable as to complain, when you know what you now suffer is but a fraction of what many of our friends have been compelled to submit to. We should manifest a proper spirit of thankfulness for the lives that have so mer- cifully been spared to us." "Bless my soul! husband, who's complaining?" said Mrs. M., warming up a little in spite of the cold. "I only said--" "I know you only said, my love," exclaimed Mr. Monroe. " but I am afraid you fall short in that faith so necessary to us all in this pilgrimage of earth, ,L My dear sir," said Murphy, "I don't see but, .as a gallant man, you must excuse a little complaint on the part of the ladies upon this particular occasion. For my part-and I'm not tender-I think our situation in this infernal nest of bushes is anything but comfortable; and to know that others are worse off, won't be apt to warm the shoulders of your good lady and Arline here-least- ways as near as I canmake it out." "But finding fault will not lighten the burden upon our own shoulders," said the clergyman; ":' and to tell you the truth, I had more confidence in your spirit." "My spirit!" exclaimed Murphy. 'By my faith.! that is a lucky word. What a stupid dolt have I been! Spirit! give us your hand. You have put me in mind of an old friend, that I have not seen since the day before yester- day. I will not introduce him to you, if you say not; but I am sure, if I make your lady and this good child here, acquainted with him, he can do them a world of good." "What do you mean, Murphy?" asked the clergyman. "What do I mean? Why see here. I've, had this companion hanging at my side all the time without as much as giving him a thought. Come, don't be shy." At these words he unslung a small canteen that hung at his side, filled with some choice whiskey, and presenting it, he continued: ,- This will send one thrill of warmth through us, and cheer us for a few moments. Come, madam-come, Arline-in an emergency like this there would be nonsense in ceremony. I am sure, my friend (to Mr. Monroe) there can be no harm in this?" "Verily, it hath its evils; nevertheless, situated as we are, and in great danger of catching our death o' cold, and bound as we are to protect ourselves against danger at all hazards, in order that our lives may be preserved that we may render good service to our fellow beings, and in consideration that no one is present whom this example will corrupt, I will not pretend to say but that we may venture to take a drop-but as a medicine." To'   REBELS AND TORIES.              189 "Most sensibly spoken, reverend sir," said Murphy passing the canteen round. Mrs. Monroe thought it rather strong, but doubted not but that it would do her a deal of good, after a while; Arlinc's pretty face looked monstrously comical, and the tears started in her eyes, while the clergyman himself, having a throat better tempered, quaffed bountifully, and as he returned the canteen to Murphy, he merely remarked: "' It is more comfortable and consoling than I anticipated; but why didn't you think of it before,? Strange!" '; Stupidity! stupidity, my dear sir, and nothing more. I deserve to be drummed out of the regiment." '"Better late than never," said Mr. Monroe; "and 1 dare say that it will be the means of doing us much good, if the Wild Medicine don't come back soon. But I want you to understand that-I am opposed to the principle." The reader must not be surprised at Mr. Monroe's familiarity with Mur- phy's friend; for in those days, and for many years after, the liquor board was one of the requisites of every family that could afford it; and any person calling upon a friend, would have considered himself insulted if the decanters were not brought forth ; and cven1at funerals, the friends of the family, and of the deceased, generally made it a point to return from the grave, to partake of the " funeral baked meats," and the wines and other liquors adorning the board. It would be difficult to show that the free customs of that ago were productive of greater abuses than the legal restrictions and opinions of the present. There might have been more, drinkers, but, possibly, there were fewer drunkards. [We beg the reader's pardon for these remarks. They are not intended to excuse a liberal use of the ardent, nor to ridicule the principles of temper- ance; but somehow or other, without intention, they have forced themselves into company where they may possibly be considered as intruders.] "Well," said Murphy; '" it must be nearly midnight, and if our cracked- brained friend don't return soon, I shall begin to think that something has happened to him; though I don't believe it is in the power of man or devil to kill him before his time comes." ("But his time may have come," said Mr. Monroe; " none of us can foretell our own end, nor the day, nor the hour thereof. His time may indeed have come, poor fellow, and he may now be lying stark and cold on the plain." "Not he. He has set his own time; and as near as I can make it out it is not far off either. But it goes further into futurity than to-night, and a great many more just like it. I say he has set his own time; and he won't die afore, Ingin or no Ingin, so there's no use talking." "Ah, Murphy!" exclaimed Mr. Monroe, " there's a great deal of the hea- then lurking in you yet." "But not much Ingin," said Murphy; "I fit that out long and long ago, over and over again; and I don't think I've done my share of it yet. Itark!" All now listened, but several moments passed before anything could be heard, except a distant yell of the Indian as he revelled over the trophies of his  victory. At length, however, they became conscious that they heard a low  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7034-00000096"/> 190         REBELS AND TORIES, and cautious *histle but a few rods distant. and on its being repeated, it was answered by Murphy, and soon after thehittle party were gratified with the presence of the Wild Medicine, bringing with him a few blankets, and'a small basket containing refreshments. The first impulse of Murphy, was to rush and meet him at the entrance of the inclosure, and easing him of his burden, he grasped him eagerly by the hand as he exclaimed: "By the pipers! I am glad you're come. Though I don't believe the incarnate red-skins can hurt you, nor anything else, yet now you are here, I did begin to fear something had happened, out of the ordinary course of things, to prevent your return. I did'nt believe it, but I kind o' feared." "It is well enough," he replied. "In the first place, light a fire. The Indians are not this way, and they are too busy with their devilish orgies to pay much attention to us. Light a fire. These women must be cold, and 'tis a long while to morning yet." This was most welcome advice; and in a few minutes, Murphy and the Wild Medicine had gathered wood enough, which, by the flints of their rifles, was soon kindled into a comfortable blaze around which they all crowded cheered with its warmth, aid enlivened by the light which enabled them to see each other's faces. The blankets were distributed among the clergyman, his wife and Arline; and thus made comfortable, their attention was next turned to the contents of the basket. This was found to be well stored with cold lamb, fowl, bread, and a small flask of spirits, which he had been fortu- nate enough to obtain from the fort; and you may be sure that the appetites that waited to do justice to this collation, were not dainty ones. In the meantime, the Wild Medicine was pushed with questions, and he was as much compelled to give an account of himself as strictly as though under a court-martial examination. "And now, Wild Medicine, if you please, just tell us what happened to keep you so long away?" asked Murphy, seizing a piece of the cold lamb. "The Indians did not leave their work of plunder till late, and I had to lay off and on, as the sailors say, waiting for an opportunity to get into the fort." "Was the massacre really dreadful 1" asked Mr. Monroe, pulling off from the body the wing of a chicken.    * Dreadful, sir!" he exclaimed, " the slaughter has been absolutely hor- rible! Blood stands in pools around the remains of many a house!" e "Poor, dear creatures!" exclaimed Mrs. Monroe, snatching a drumstick. "What will become of the widows and orphans? This is a dreadfully wicked world, Sir?" "Wicked, Madam I what of that? It is only the weak who suffer! Who cares for innocence and helplessness?" said the Wild Medicine. "Who of our friends are victims of this massacre?" asked Mr. Monroe. "There is the family of your friend Dunlop," said the Wild Medicine. "Are they not spared," almost shrieked Arline: at the same time dropping into the fire a wishing-bone. "What of Samuel Dunlop?" eagerly inquired Mr. Monroe. "You will not tell me that they have not even spared his grey hairs?" "No; and for his life he may thank a wild Indian-Little Aaron, who stood f   -^   .'

"' Heaven have mercy!" exclaimed Mr. Monroe, raising his hands; " what had these aged and innocent persons done to deserve such a bitter fate?" ' And the entire family of Mitchell are swept off-the Wellses, every soul, excepting the boy at Schenectady, and many others of beloved memory." "Alas! what a day of utter woe!" exclaimed the clergyman; " how sinful and ungrateful for us to complain. The comparison of their misery should render us happy!" But there will be an avenger. Sir!" exclaimed the Wild Medicine. "As sure as water drowns and fire burns, the day of retribution will come to some who have had a hand in the past day's horrors. Though the wrath of heaven may sometimes be slow, yet 'tis as certain as fate! Ah! 'tis a dreadful sight!-to walk amongst the ruins of lesolate homes-to stumble in the night over the mangled bodies of beloved friends!-to listen to the howlings and wailings of anguish!-to be deafened by 'the yells and shoutings of the infu- riate victors!-if these are not enough to drive one mad, then commend me to fools! To see men turn traitors, and league with tyrants and savages, will almost make one curse his species!" "And I," exclaimed Murphy- 'I was not there to strike a blow or pull a trigger in defence of the helpless!" "But you saved without striking," said Arline; "and no one, knowing your courage, would hazard a doubt that you did not well and nobly perform the service allotted to you." "Ah, Miss!" replied Murphy, "to be praised by such lips, were reward enough for more desperate service than I have seen in yonder fiend-work. The Wild Medicine, here, knows that when the occasion offers, my will is not poor nor my arm slow to be in the thickest part of the fight. But this self- praise, after all, is poor praise." ' We have had too many proofs of your courage and generosity to doubt you on any occasion," said Arline. 'Well, I thank you," said Murphy; "it would take rather more than a red Ingin, a king's officer, or a rascally Tory, to drive me from my game when fairly set on." "And you," said Mr. Monroe, addressing the Wild Medicine, "have you gone forth and returned unstained by the bad blood of the foe? I don't like the destruction of human life, even in self-defence, if it can be helped." "I have touched no hair of any man's head!" he exclaimed. "What! have you not fallen in with your old foe?" asked Murphy. "I met him, and crushed him!" exclaimed the Wild Medicine, with terrible earnestness; " but not with blows. I pierced him to the heart, and he fell, groaning and writhing to the earth, but no blood was shed! That has not arrived." "And the youngster-he who pursued us to this place, and with whom you held parley? What has become of him?" "That is the only creature on earth that I fear! for 'there is a cross of blood betwixt us that is dangerous!"   &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7034-00000097"/> 192         REBELS AND    TORIES. By this time the cravings of hunger had been allayed, and the old gentleman and the two ladies being much fatigued, the Wild Medicine and Murphy pre- pared for them a couch of branches and leaves, and while they sought rest from the fatigues and cares of the past few hours, the Rifleman and his com- panion kept watch to prevent surprise by any straggling parties of the enemy, and to renew, as occasion required, the fire around which reposed the fugitives. CHAPTER   XXII. THE SICK CHAMBER AND THE LETTER. "EAVING the wilderness for a while, we shall return to the city of New York, and, as a matter of course, shall lose no time in calling upon our old friend Mrs. Vanderdt enhoppen, whom we left upon a sick-bed. She was regularly visited every day by her bosom friehd and confidant, Miss Smitch- firken; and although the latter, in the simplicity of her heart, would insist upon it that her friend would recover, if she would only take time for it, still Mrs. V. rather insisted upon getting worse, a fact that at last her physician did not attempt to conceal from her. It was near the close of a dreary, uncomfortable day in the latter part of November-about two weeks after the Cherry Valley massacre-that Mrs. Vanderduzenhoppen reclined, high bolstered in her bed, listening to the coun- sel and advice of her friend Smitchfirken, who had, at length, on a consultation with tie physician, come to the conclusion that the sick woman could not last long; and she therefore felt it incumbent upon her to ascertain if her mind was easy upon the score of parting from the fascinations of the world. There was one other point, also, upon which her curiosity was bound to be satisfied -she did not believe that Mrs. Vanderduzenhoppen would die a happy woman, unless she disclosed what she knew of the secrets of the forbidden room. She was determined that the mystery should be probed to the bottom, and unless the matter was made as plain to her as the large capital letters on the title page of her own family bible, she should lay it to her heart that the friend whom she had so much trusted in, had entered into a solemn league with his Satanic majesty for the possession of her immortal part; and should this be the case, she would not hazard her own safety to comfort or console a dozen friends; and she moreover came to the conclusion that she was tempting a wise Providence, and placing her personal safety in jeopardy, by staying a moment under the same roof with her-under a roof that was every night liable to be blown off at the devil's expense. These convictions, or sentiments, or ideas, induced her at last to drop all minor topics of conversation, and come at once to the very subject that was a perfect nightmare to her-thus: -' That you have not got the glanders, my dear, you may thank your bless- ed stars and worsted garters." "I thought only horses had the glanders, Miss Smitchfirken," said Mrs. Vanderduzenhoppen.   i t;ELS AND T ( R I E.           193 Nonsense, my dear!" exclaimed the spinster. " \What does a horse know about diseases? I tell you 1 asked the doctor, and he says you have not got the yellow glanders. Isn't that enough?" What a singular question," said Mrs. V. ': To you it may seem so, my friend. But the doctor did tell me-1 do know what is the matter with you." Indeed!" exclaimed Mrs. V. "Indeed, indeed," re-echoed Smitchrken; and I think he is about right, for he says you are in a most melancholy state, and at the best can only last a little while longer'?" '-I have already lasted longer than I expected, therefore you have not told me anything new. What else have you to say?" "Why, my dear Mrs. Vanderduzenhoppen. really-that is, you must excuse me-but-I do not want to hurt your feelings-but, in your situation, I am positive I could not go out of the world in peace with the secrets of yon room on my conscience. So, as I was thinking, don't you think you had better make a clean breast of it at once, confess the whole caper, and die in peace with all the world?" This was a little bit of coolness that took the invalid by surprise; and after pausing a moment or two, as if weighing the kindness of her friend's advice, she turned toward her and said: "I am glad you have spoken, Miss Smitchfirken, for it gives me an oppor- tunity of satisfying you on a point which has for so many years been a subject of much perplexity to you. You must remember my poor brother?" "Good gracious!" exclaimed the spinster, "didn't I know him almost as well as myself? and didn't I come near being his blessed wife, only he fell in with another that he thought he should like better, but she didn't last as long. Why, 1 could have gone through ten times as much as she did, and not have minded it at all. Didn't I know your brother John? Well, what of him?" ': Yesterday I had a letter from him," said Mrs. V. A letter! mercy on nme alive! Where is it? let inc see it." You know I have not set eyes on him for more than twenty years, and I should long ago have thought him dead, if it had not been for certain things." "When is ihe comling home?" inquired Miss Smitchfirkcn. "1 really be- lieve I should not know him, if I should see lim standing a living man right before me in this very room." "You will not be surprised by a sight of him. He has at last given me per- mission to open the room, as he has no more secrets to hide, and his penance is most completed." "Where's the key? I must go in that room-I know I must," said Miss Smitchfirken, as she bounced out of her chair as though she would bolt into the room through partitions and every other impediment. "There's nothing for you to see," said Mrs. V.; " for the walls are as bare as your thumb-nail. No vestige is left of anything, except the old bedstead; and how the things were ever taken away without the knowledge of any one, is more than I can tell." I am sure it is simple enougl." said the spinster; "for it must be plain to 13  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7034-00000098"/> 194         REBELS  AND TORIES. a child that the old evil one has got a finger in it, for else how could such things be done without your knowledge?" "Whatever evil spirit has had to do with it, 1 am sure he has been a very quiet one for this house; though I very much doubt if one has been in it since my poor brother buried his wife, now going on twenty-two years." "I know who you mean, and I rather grant it," said Miss Smitchfirken; "but I would monstrously like to see your brother's letter, though perhaps it is noneo f my business." "John," said the sick woman to the lad who sat by her bedside, will you give Miss Smitchfirken the letter which came yesterday? You will find it on the table yonder.". John produced the desired letter, and by the aid of a good candle and an excellent pair of spectacles, Miss Smitchfirken was enabled to read as fol- lows:- "Dear Sister,--By intelligence which I always look out to receive from the city, I learn that you are sick-dangerously so; and I am now induced, after long experience of absence and of silence, to write you for the purpose of eas- ing your mind on one or two points. which to you must have always appeared wrapped in mystery. Though you have never known of my whereabouts, I have never failed, every year since you last saw me, to visit your house, and spend a night in my own room to the memory of one who, even at this  hour, makes at once a child and a fiend of me-,a child, when I remember her virtue and her love; a fiend, when I conjure up the features of him whose malice pursued her to the grave! And I swore to be revenged! You attested the wrong-you heard the oath i and I knew, as sure as the seasons performed their duties, that the awful debt should be paid, year by year, until cancelled! and I groaned, struggled, and suffered; but fate has been just to me in the special prayer of my soul-revenge! and it has been so unerringly meted out, that but one more payment is due, and then-I must go myself to judgment!

Rest assured that he merits the reward in store for himl. These feelings you may think unnatural; but there is a relief in thinking that the world cannot meddle with them. It will never know enough of' lme to judge me. "As for yourself, you are to me as ever-my sister: the only being on earth that I would like to see; but the meeting would not gratify you. 'I am so changed, that all you knew of your brother has long since dlDarted. You could not recognise me if I were present. Better remember te as I was, thanu as I am. "And now farewell! In the wilderness, and among savages, 1 have friends who esteem me. It is sometling to think of this. Outcast as I amI I have been a welcome messenger to many. God bless you! This is the last you will ever hear of me; but be assured, next to one other name, yours will be the last on my lips; and thus take the blessing of your BROTHE R." Thus closed Miss Smitchfirken the letter. There was neither date nor lo- cality about it, and no clue by which his sister could guess of his whereabouts. As the spinster closed the singular epistle, she folded it carefully, and taking off her spectacles, she wiped the moisture from her eyes (for gossip as she was, she possessed some of the feelings of humanity) and after a moment's silence, she said: "Well, well, here is a mystery indeed. Who would have believed it! Poor John! in the wilderness indeed!-and among savages, too! 1 wonder- I wonder why he has not long ago been eaten up! Poor dear me! that ever I should live to hear of such strange things! But what are you a-going to do " "I don't know," said the invalid. "I am sure of this-that I have not many days to live; and I don't know why I should care, either, if it were not fbr my sons. To be sure, there will be a comfortable penny for them; but that won't pay for a nother. As my poor brother says-I fear for William." "But you tell me he is going away with a great officer," said the spinster; and I am sure that will make a man of him." "Yes; Colonel Campbell has been ordered South; his forces embark to- morrow, and William goes with him." "What!" exclaimed Miss Smitchfirken, "to jine the British! Mercy on me I how can you let him?" "How can I help it? Healeaus that way, and all that I could say has not  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7034-00000099"/> 196         REBELS AND TORIES. been able to convince him. It's a. sorrowful thought for me; but it won't be so bad as staying here, and keeping company with bad young men." "But to jine the British! If he was a son of mine, I'd rather see him in his coffin!" said the spinster in a tone of patriotism quite as commendable as it was indignant. "But you never was a mother," said the invalid, "and of course you can't appreciate the feelings of one." "More's the pity!--more's the pity, my dear; for if I had a son, he should never jine the British!" "But I will not join the British, mother," said John. "For I'm sure they must be wrong, or General Washington would not take such pains to fight them; nor would the Rebels, as they call them, go into battle barefooted and hungry, and with no pay." "That's a good boy!" exclaimed the spinster, placing her hand on his head. "God bless you for that! You shall be my boy after all." Here the doctor came in, just as the sick woman was taken with a fit of coughing.- It was a crisis. The spinster hurried out to bring in one of the neighbors, and John knelt by the side of his mother's bed. CHAPTER XXXIV. PAYMENT IN FULL. AFTER the massacre at Cherry Valley, Brant and Butler, with their forces, retired to Niagara. From this place, in February following, Butler wrote a letter to General Clinton, denying that cruelties were committed by the men under his command-with how much truth let the impartial and candid reader judge for himself. With this massacre, however, terminated for that year, the warlike operations of the north, the British and their allies, the Tories and the Indians, going into winter quarters. On the departure of the enemy, such of the inhabitants as had escaped from the village returned, and among the number were Mr. Monroe, his wife, and Arline. It was a dismal scene to the survivors as they walked around the smouldering ruins of their late happy homes, and listened in vain for the voices that made their places cheerful. The house of the clergyman had been spared, though much of the furniture, and many of his books, were destroyed. As there was now a prospect of an idle winter for Murphy, he concluded to take up his quarters for the season with Mr. Monroe; and there you might have found him ensconsed through the cold long evenings, in close proximity to the fire, listening to the illustration of some favorite text of Scripture, or rehearsing to the little party about him, some wild adventure of his own; but more particularly intended, no doubt, for the ear of Arline. We will not say that by this time she had forgotten Charles Rowley; neither was she one of those heroines of romance-and found no where else-that nurse a passion for years, giving that affection to the dead that is so necessary to the living. We 7      .- 7   REBELS AND    TORIES.         197 do say, however, that hlle ;crviees of Murphy. and the many excclclt traitl which Arline had discoveredl in his character. lhad given her great lt;ason to esteem him; while the Ricleman, as he looked into the blue depthls of' her (\yes, felt himself, day by day. becoming more involved in A4e intric acies of an attachment that must terminate for him either in bliss or misery--that is, such misery as disappointed lovers vote themselves. In this condition we must leave them to the rcader, hazarding an apprehension, nevertheless, that the long winter evenings which are before them, will do very little toward allaying the fever, in spite of the cold. Muchl persuasion was used to detain the Wild Medicine with the family, if only for a few days, but to no purpose. He would stay but one night with them, and the next morning he departed, urging important business and a dreary way to travel. Arline and Murphy followed him to the door, where, taking the hand of the former, he said:- ' You are like a young dove, my pretty maiden, and may the haw:k never fly a pinion near you. You are living in the midst of stormy times, a(ndl sometimes among bad neighbors; but there is a true heart beating for you, and a strong arm ready to defend you. Both you may rely upon; you will never find truer. I have tried both amid the roar of the battle and in the perils of the wintry forest. God bless you! i1' 1 live we shall meet again. Murphy, you will never forget me!" With these words, shaking them both by the hands, he darted out in the street, down which he passed rapidly, and in a few moments he was out of sight. And now we must come to the closing scenes of the drama. In the heart of the forest, in the depth of winter, there was a rude log hut tenanted by a single being. It seemed to have been erected only for a tempo- rary purpose. What could have induced that lone mann thus to have shut himself out from the world-to pitch his tent in the wilderness, far from the abodes of his species? Tt is night. The storm howls fearfully without, and the ground is covered with snow to the depth of a foot. and the snow is still falling. Over a fire in his cabin sits that solitary nan. lie is bent forward, his head resting between his hands. If you could peer into his face, you would hardly .recognise it, though you have often met it. Iis look is hag- gard-something betwixt despair and hatred, or a mixture of both; and yet this don't describe it. You might mistake him for a man who was brooding over some terrible revenge, or you might think him one who has been crushed by a dreadful calamity, or you might suppose him a criminal who had fled thither to escape the punishment of a serious crime. At every noise of the forest he started, at every shriek of the tempest he trembled. Yet looked he a strong man-yet looked he like one not likely to be easily frightened.  At last he raised his head and groaned aloud; he rose to his feet with clenched hands, and spoke-for mnin when alone, and under strong excitement, will talk to themselves-- "This is intolcrathl(. It ir noAt flr . yself th!:t I fi:,;r. My wife nld chil- dron-were I wto. t   '.

This torture exceeds the judgment of the damned. Twenty-two years of persecution through a malice greater than a fiend's-nor stratagem nor force could remove my foe. My children-my boys! That is a thought that maddens. Murderer that I am, I see his blood before me now! I hear his shriek for mercy, in vain,-in vain! What should I know of mercy! Awful judgment! And the ring of that maniac's laugh pierces my brain. Brave work for a father! But I buried him-I buried the boy, and wept over him! God knows I would not have killed him! God knows that when I struck him I was blind with smoke! This night-to-mor- row-there must be a fearful account settled. If I see the coming of the new year, I will forsake this country, and with my wife and only remaining child return to the land of my birth. There it is possible I may forget my misery, and by my devotion to the living, atone in some measure for my cruelty to the dead. Ah! can I ever forget? Will memory ever cease to haunt me with the dreadful spectres of the past? Upton-Upton-if I could but destroy him I should be safe. But this will soon terminate. To-morrow will be the last anniversary, and in this solitude, amid these snows, there is but little chance of my being discovered. Then for Canada-then for Eng- land, ho!" The speaker will be recognised as Leffers. Unceasing and unrelenting as had been the persecution of Upton, he had no right to expect that he would be overlooked in the final closing of the account between them. The expira- tion of the twenty-two years fixed by Upton had nearly arrived, and he knew not where to turn his steps, nor in what place to lay his head, to escape the vigilant eye of his enemy. lie believed that, could he pass over the ap- pointed time, -e should be safe; and for this purpose he had selected his present abode" from a belief that it would be almost impossible to discover him, especially in the winter, when human foot seldom wandered in that region of the wilderness. In the midst of civilization he would be known; on all the principal routes of travel he would be likely to be followed; and the only place of refuge that he could think of was in the solitude of the forest. There, then, he had built him his habitation-there he had determined to stay until the first of the ensuing month. If at that time he remained undis- covered, he would make an effort to rejoin his wife in Canada. It was now the night of the fifteenth of December, 1778. One day more in the calendar brought Leffers to the anniversary of his attachment for debt- twenty-two years. To-morrow, then, the debt was to be paid, and as the storm howled on without, he trembled, and as the storm howled on without it almost assured him of safety. At length, toward midnight, worn out with anxiety, he threw himself upon his rude couch of boughs, and obtained oblivion for the past, in slumber. Dreams did not even haunt him as he slept-or if he had visions, they only referred to the scenes of his boyhood, or, possibly, to his wife and children. It was late the nexw morning when Leffers awoke. The storm had ceased, and the sun was trying to struggle through the ragged clouds that were hur- rying, like angry couriers, to the eastward. The weather was not excessively cold, and there was as much cheerfulness in the forest as was possible for the   REBELS AND TORIEs.             199 seasor. The snow-birds were flying among the branches, and chirping merrily, and the tap of the wood-pecker was heard on the trees. Leffers stood in the door of his cabin, leaning upon his gun. His pulse beat high, his heart throbbed, his eye was brighter than usual, and his cheeks were flushed, He speaks: "Would to God I knew the result of this day! It is now well on toward noon, and a few hours more-I dare not think of it! Oh, that to-morrow were here! Oh, that this day were well over! Yet it is impossible-it can- not be, that I shall be found! I must be safe! no one could follow me here. This time I think at least I have cheated my enemy. But the hours are long-they lag heayily." Hark! what was that? Whw comes here to wake the echoes in this dreary- forest? See! Leffers turns pale. In spite of the cold, the perspiration starts upon his forehead, and his knees tremble beneath him. He has to lean for support against jthe side of the hut. Again, hark! Coming throughi the woody avenes--quivering among the tall branches, waving through the bushes, there is a laugh so wild and maniac like, that the deer are startled from their coverts, and theowl is frightened in the old hollow tree. It is repeated, and Leffers staggers back to his hut, to awaiththe result. His nerves refuse their office, he has not strength manfully to resist. The hopes and the expectations but a moment ago indulged in, are vanished; he beholds his fate staring hin in the face. There is one chance yet-why may he not seize it? He will! tie takes his gun, examines the flint and, priming, arid once more stands in the doorway of his cabin. Death to the intruder! On he comes-that wild being-through the snow. He is clothed in skins, and his legs and feet are protected by moccasins of undressed deer-skin. On he comes-chaunting a wild song-laughing a fiendish chorls. Leffers stands like a strong man in defence of his castle. Who shall dare to disturb him? Hark!  "Ho! ho! Nahum Leffers! You doubted I would come to pay you'! so you thought you would put me to a-deal of trouble. But you may see that I am a punctual man. You did not believe that I would find you. I have not forsaken you for a month. I never can forget you." This heard Leffers, though he could see no one. He strains his oyes-- nothing, nothing; but he can hear the laugh. Ha! now, now' something is perceptible, just through the thin underbrush yonder. Now it is more palpa- bl-' it is the figure of a man; Not a moment is to be lost. lie raises his gun-the aim is deliberate, only the hand is a little tremnulous. Crack! What a laugh-what a terrible laugh; that makes the blood of Leffers chill with horror! He will fall, surely, he is so weak. Go' in, Nahum; re-load. Why tempt your fate, "Blood, Nahum Leffers, blood! Let it flow, reeking hot. It will smoke. I am your debtor-is it not so? Good! then I will pay you!" Leffers could not retreat from the door.-Absolutely awed by the fate that awaited him, he had neither strength to fly, nor nerve to resist. Ike a con- demned criminal he stood awaiting his punishment. It began. There wasthe sharp crack of a rifle, and Leffers fell, face foremost, out of 4,  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7034-00000101"/> 2O!0         REBELS  AND TORIES. the doorway of his cabin. Forward, then, stalked Upton-the Wild Medi- cine--till he stood Over the prostrate form of his foe. He seemed like a mon- arch drunk at a feast-absolutely gloating over the intoxication of his re- venge  "Mercy! Mercy!" implored Leffers. "Have I not suffered enough! You have robbed me of all,wife and children, and you have haunted and curs- ed me for a lifeime, and are you not satisfied? Spare me, if only to repent?" "  Ha! ha! beg, grovel, groan and die! Mercy! What is that? Remem- ber the dead-remember the cry for mercy twenty-two years ago! Revenge! Mercy!-remember the cry for mercy at Cherry ly Vl!-remember the kneeling boy! Revenge!"! "Oh, God! it was my own son! Was I not punished enough? Spare me further torture."           , "No I there is no mercy for you; so pray if you can, and by such blasphemy' damn your soul!" "My wife! my wife!" almost:shrieked Leffers. "You spared not mine, lifeless and cold as she was. You spared not me, erushed and wounded as I was " "But I repent! I was wrong! I have suffered." "Oh, devil! You would, have slain me but a moment ago. Expect not me to spare you." "God have mercy, then!" exclaimed Leffers, in despair. "There is no hope butin death." "Come! you must away with me. Day and night-day and night. you must follow me, as I have followed you. Alive or dead, we must not part again. Come!" Leffers tried to raise himself; he could not. In his endeavors, however, in putting his hand to his side, it camel in contact with his hunting-knife. How fortunate. He grasped it, and mnaking another attempt to raise himself, he staggered forward, and made a passiat his foe. How vain the attempt! The latter, whose eye was quick as thoukht, detected the movement, and with the butt of his rifle he felled him again'to the ground. The brain was crushed, and Leffers wasall but lifeless. Then the forest rang againwith furious laugh- ter, and kneeling over his victtn, thus the Wild Medicine addressed him, in- animate though he was:    ' "So closes the record of many Wears. Die! wretch that would deny rest to the dead! Die thou trafficker in human flesh, nobler and freer born than yourself! Die! murderer of the innocent. with the blood of your own kin upon your hands. Through the gates of death you shall be haunted by the goats of all whom you have wronged or slain! Come let us travel! I have a weary journey to go and you must along. We never part more!-we nevei part more Here and hereafter!-through all time and eternity, we twain shall be twin! Come! we will drive the bears and the wolves before us Come!" Seizing Leffers by the kerchief that was around. his neck, he commenced dragging him away. With the arm of a giant, almost, on he went with his burden, through the snow, chaunting odd sentences of rhyme, mingled with   Is 1: ;: L ' A 1) '1' (0 s I  .   01t laughter and shrieks of revenge. On he went, never seeming to tire; and when the sun made a weary halt at night, still pushed he on, dragging the body after him, by this time stiff and cold! *a   *   *   *   *     *  *   *   * The day following dawned with splendor. The sky was cloudless, and the sun had such warmth that the snows began to melt. The Wild Medicine still bore his burden, but in silence. Fatigue seemed nearly to have wpori him. down, and there was a strange gleam in his eyes, that indicated that now in reality he was a madman. He was approaching one of the settlements, and the hour about meridian. Parties were out hunting, and he could hear the hallooitg to the dogs. Presently a deer bounded past him, fleet as an arrow; then a herd. In a few minutes more two hounds rushed past. lie relin- quishe his burden for a moment. and sat down upon a stump to rest. lHe was in bight of a cataract. The roar of the waters attracted his attention. lie resumed his tramp. "Cooe!" said he, taking up the body: " come; the thunder of waters is good misic. Let us go. I love to sit on the dizzy brink and gaze into the boiling ulf below! We will sit there awhile, and learn something. Come!" On he went, wearily and slow, till he reached the cliff of the precipice. Here the whirl of the waters seemIed to excite him, and as hle gazed into the fearful abyss, he shouted: "Roar! waters, roar! Hiss and foam! I am as wild and as mad a ye! Oh, ye elements! terrible and strong, who will chain ye! What, ho! Nahum Leffers t will you? Look, wretch, look! Iush, he sleeps! There, there! that is the spirit of 'the cataract.

He was young, vigorous, and armed with a gun. When lie saw him, he gave a shout of recognition. "Ho h ho! are you so near, my young sexton! What, have you a brave heart, and fear to do a murder! Drowning a man is not murder! Bloodshed is not murder! To kill a rival is no murder! Ila! ha! "heseare all brave acts-no murder!" As he ceased speaking, the young man rushed forward, till he stood near enough to recognise the features of the maniac, and then he exclaimed: "Devil! We have met again!

Early in thespring the body of a manzwas found in the water about two miles below Trenton Falls; and from a much defaced and al- most illegible memorandum foundsupon him, it was discovered to be the remains of a man well known throughout the Mohawk country as the Wild Medicine; and several years previous to that, remembered in New York as John Upton. This memorandum contained the statement of a murder which the writer had i seen committed on the person of a young man named Rowley, in New York Bay, off 'the shore of Communipau, in New Jersey, By another young man by the name of Ralph Upton-the cause, jealousy. It stated' that the writer was the father of the said Upton. This evidence, in connection with other testimony which was procured, mostly circumstantial, was thought suffoiient to warrant the arrest of young UITpton; and his guilt, on trial, being fully established, he was condemned, septenced and hung. Mrs. Vanderduzenhoppen died soon after receiving the letter from her brother. William, as has been stated, went south with the forces under Col. Campbell; and his brother John, from his amiable character, found a friend in the person of a merchant, who introduced him to his counting-rooin, whence he graduated to a position as partner. Walter Butler fell in the Fall of 1781, in an engagement with a body of American troops, under Colonel Willett, on the Canada Creek. He was first wounded by the rifle of an Oneida warrior, who, as he rushed forward Cfor his scalp, finding him not dead, shot him through the eye. The Tory, Newberry, was made prisoner in the summer of 1779, and hung by order of General James Clinton. As for Arline and Murphy--their intimacy increased; and though the msuc ceeding spring parted them-he to join the army-he frequently had an op- portunity of visiting the clergyman; and on. the termination of the war, Mr. Monroe had the pleasure of uniting them in "wedlock's bonds,"-a very virtuous and happy couple. In a few years more the worthy clergyman and his wife were gathered to their kindred dust, honored amn wept by many a sorrowing friend. 7-   D b   - v e 5   &#xD;</p>
